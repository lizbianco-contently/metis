Mr. President, later this morning the Senate will vote on \nthe issue of whether to limit debate on the USA PATRIOT Act. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the cloture motion. The PATRIOT Act passed with \nnear unanimous support 4 years ago. Since its passage, this commonsense \nlaw has proved to be one of the most useful, important tools we have in \nour antiterror arsenal. If we can take ourselves back to that morning \non September 11, many people were at work, many others on the way to \nwork when we all heard and soon saw that shocking news that 19 young \nmen had hijacked four passenger planes and slammed them into the World \nTrade Center and into the Pentagon, 3 or 4 miles away. A fourth plane \nwas en route, and its fate was unknown.\n  The oceans separating us from them suddenly vanished and America was \nstruck with a horrific force we had never seen before. Three thousand \ninnocent Americans lost their lives, and we learned on that dark day \nthat out there, hiding in the shadows, is a patient and brutal enemy, \ndetermined to inflict colossal violence on our shores.\n  This enemy does not wear a uniform or march under a national banner. \nIt hides among us as neighbors and coworkers, at subway shops and at \ncyber cafes. It hides in plain sight, plotting and planning until the \nmoment comes to inflict its massive and terrible cruelty.\n  On 9/11, our enemy declared war on the American people, and war is \nwhat they got. We toppled the Taliban in Afghanistan. We brought down \nSaddam Hussein and dismantled his tyranny. Yesterday, under the \nprotection of brave American and Iraqi soldiers, 11 million Iraqi \npeople streamed to the polls to freely choose, for the first time in \nthe country's modern history, a permanent, democratically elected \ngovernment of and by the people. It was a historic milestone for the \nIraqi people. It was a historic milestone for freedom. It proved once \nagain that every day we are making progress.\n\n  We are fighting the terrorist enemy at home and in the mountains of \nAfghanistan, on the worldwide Web and in the streets of Baghdad. We are \ncoordinating our efforts both inside and outside our borders so that we \nnever have to suffer another terrorist attack.\n  In the days following 9/11, we learned that the enemy had been able \nto elude law enforcement, in part because our agencies were not able to \nshare key investigative information. Once we understood this awful \nreality, we swiftly took action. Within 6 weeks of the attacks on \nAmerica, the Congress passed the USA PATRIOT Act with overwhelming \nbipartisan support. The Senate vote was near unanimous, with 98 \nSenators voting in favor. The PATRIOT Act went to work tearing down the \ninformation wall between agencies and allowed the intelligence \ncommunity and law enforcement to work more closely in pursuit of \nterrorist suspects.\n  Since then, it has been highly effective in tracking down terrorists \nand making our country safer. Because of the PATRIOT Act, the United \nStates has charged over 400 suspected terrorists. More than half of \nthem have already been convicted. Because of the PATRIOT Act, law \nenforcement has broken up terrorist cells all across the country, from \nNew York to California, Oregon, Virginia, and Florida.\n  In San Diego, officials were able to use the PATRIOT Act to \ninvestigate and prosecute several suspects in an al-Qaida drug-for-\nweapons plot. The investigation led to several guilty pleas.\n  The PATRIOT Act also allowed prosecutors and investigators to crack \nthe Virginia Jihad case, involving 11 men who had trained for Jihad in \nnorthern Virginia, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. It specifically \nencourages information sharing among the many branches of Government so \nthat our crime-fighting officials can adapt and respond more \neffectively to the terrorist threat. It also levels the playing field, \nso that law enforcement utilizes the tools they already have in other \nkinds of criminal cases, such as drug trafficking and mob activity. It \nis now easier for law enforcement at all levels to appropriately \ninvestigate and track suspected terrorists already in the United \nStates.\n  The conference report to reauthorize the PATRIOT Act includes all of \nthese provisions and goes further to strengthen and improve America's \nsecurity. It enhances vital safeguards to protect our civil liberties \nand privacy, and it contains new provisions to combat terrorist \nfinancing and money laundering, to protect our mass transportation \nsystems and railways from attacks such as the ones on the London subway \nlast summer, secure our seaports, and fight methamphetamine drug abuse, \nAmerica's No. 1 drug problem.\n  The clock is ticking. We do need to take action now. In just 15 \ndays--December 31--nearly all of the provisions of the PATRIOT Act \nexpire. If they do, we are right back to where we were pre-9/11. The \ninformation walls go right back up. We cannot let this happen. We \ncannot lose ground.\n  The House, as we all know, acted last week. They passed a conference \nreport with a bipartisan vote of 251 to 174. Now is the time for the \nSenate to follow suit.\n  The choice is clear. Should we take a step forward in making America \nsafer or should we go back to the pre-9/11 days when terrorists slipped \nthrough the cracks? I believe the answer is clear, and I believe we \nhave only one choice.\n  I ask my colleagues who are threatening to filibuster to take a \ncloser look at that PATRIOT Act conference report. This reasonable \ncompromise reached by Senate and House negotiators may not contain \neverything that each and every Member in this body would like, but it \nis much closer to the Senate bill that passed unanimously than it is to \nthe House bill. It includes 4-year sunsets on the most controversial \nprovisions, just as in the Senate version. And like the Senate version, \nit includes extensive privacy and civil liberty safeguards, as well as \nenhanced congressional oversight.\n  As we prepare to vote on cloture later this morning, I urge my \ncolleagues to join in support of this essential legislation.\n  The FBI, the intelligence community, and our law enforcement need us \nto act. The American people want us to act. American national security \ndemands that we act. A nation in fear cannot be a nation that is free.\n  I urge my colleagues to stand up for freedom and security for the \nUnited States of America.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/16/senate-section/article/S13690-3", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13690]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MARTINEZ).

Mr. President, in approximately an hour and a half, there \nwill be a vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the PATRIOT Act \nconference report. Rather than terminate debate on this flawed piece of \nlegislation, the Senate should work harder to achieve a strong, \nbipartisan PATRIOT Act that\n\n[[Page S13691]]\n\nstrengthens national security while protecting the privacy of innocent \nAmericans.\n  Earlier this year, after negotiations that went late into the night, \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously approved a bill to \nreauthorize and improve the PATRIOT Act. Soon after, the full Senate \npassed this bill by unanimous consent. Every Senator, Democrat and \nRepublican, approved this reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act. Every \nDemocrat and every Republican in the Senate--every one of us--is firmly \non record in support of giving law enforcement the appropriate tools to \nfight terrorism.\n  We all know the House of Representatives is in shambles. Leadership \nis in a state of disarray.\n  The spirit of bipartisanship that led to passage of the Senate bill, \nbecause of the problems in the House of Representatives, did not \nprevail in the conference. Not long after the House appointed \nconferees, Democratic negotiators were shut out of discussions. In \nfact, Senator Leahy's staff was directed by the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee in the House to leave the room.\n  The final bill was written by Republican-only conferees working \nbehind closed doors with Justice Department lawyers. The result was an \nimbalanced conference report that departed significantly from the \nbipartisan Senate bill.\n  Chairman Specter, to his credit, joined other conferees in refusing \nto sign the conference report. Over the next few weeks, he and Senator \nLeahy worked hard to improve it and succeeded in eliminating some of \nthe worst provisions.\n  I commend and applaud the efforts of the chairman and our ranking \nmember to work to improve this conference report.\n  But I am sorry to say, in my view--and in the view of many of my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle--the conference report still does \nnot contain enough checks on the expanded powers granted to the \nGovernment by the PATRIOT Act. It simply is not acceptable.\n  I supported the passage of the original PATRIOT Act in 2001. This was \nenacted in the days immediately following the vicious attacks on \nSeptember 11, 2001. I do not regret my vote. Much of the original act \nconsisted of noncontroversial efforts to update and strengthen basic \nlaw enforcement authorities. More than 90 percent of the 2001 act is \nalready part of permanent law and will not expire at the end of this \nyear.\n  We are currently considering renewal of these provisions that were \nconsidered so expansive and so vulnerable to abuse that Congress wisely \ndecided to subject them to 4-year sunsets, meaning that after 4 years \nthey had to be renewed or they would fall. The authors of the act \nwanted Congress to reassess these in a more deliberative manner with \nthe benefit of experience.\n  The act of 2001 came, as I mentioned, when the country was feeling \nthe devastation of the terrorist attacks of 2001. I, frankly, don't \nthink we took enough time at that time to do it the right way. That is \nwhy a number of us demanded the sunset provisions.\n  Now, more than 4 years later, we are presented with the opportunity \nto do it right.\n  While the conference report before us makes certain improvements over \nthe original PATRIOT Act, it still does not strike the right balance.\n  We can provide the Government with the powers it needs to investigate \npotential terrorists and terrorist activity and at the same time \nprotect the freedom of innocent Americans.\n  Liberty and security are not contradictory. Additional congressional \nand judicial oversight of the Government's surveillance and \ninvestigative authorities need not hamper the Government's ability to \nfight terrorism.\n  I say to the Presiding Officer, someone whose heritage is from the \nisland of Cuba, where there is very little liberty and very little \nsecurity, we are in the United States of America. We are not a \ndictatorship like Cuba. We can have liberty and we can have security.\n  As I said, additional congressional and judicial oversight of the \nGovernment's surveillance and investigative authorities need not hamper \nthe Government's ability to fight terrorism. These checks are needed to \nensure that the Government does not overreach or violate the privacy of \nordinary American citizens who have nothing to do with terrorism.\n  Is there any reason to be concerned? Yes. There is a reason to be \nconcerned.\n  For example, the need for such checks is based on a number of things, \nnot the least of which is the story that ran in the Washington Post in \nearly November of this year after the Senate passed the bill. The story \nreported that the FBI issues more than 30,000 national security letters \na year--30,000. These letters go to businesses. And they say: I want \nyou to tell everything you know about Ron Weich, Gary Myrick, Russ \nFeingold, Herb Kohl. It doesn't matter who it is. And that person--the \nnames I have mentioned--does not know that they have had this request \nto give all information about them or any information about them. The \nperson who has been requested to give the information can't tell them. \nIt is against the law to tell them.\n  These national security letters are issued by FBI agents without any \njudicial supervision. The third party recipients of these orders, such \nas banks, phone companies, and Internet service providers, are \nprohibited, as I have said, from telling anyone that they have been \nserved. The customers whose records are seized will never know that the \nFBI has gathered their personal information.\n  For example, the article described an incident at the end of 2003 in \nwhich the Department of Homeland Security compiled information of \nhundreds of thousands of New Year's visitors to Las Vegas. They \nobtained the records of everyone who had rented a hotel room, car, or \nstorage unit, and every airplane passenger who landed in the city of \nLas Vegas. They obtained records, how much they paid for their hotel \nroom, did they order any X-rated movies. I don't know what other \ninformation they got.\n  When Las Vegas businesses objected to this effort to gather \nunprecedented amounts of information on their customers, the FBI \nresponded by serving them with national security letters. According to \none law enforcement source quoted in this piece, agents encouraged \nvoluntary disclosure of information by threatening to demand further \nrecords, further profiles from the casinos about their guests.\n  Perhaps worst of all, what happened in Las Vegas did not stay in Las \nVegas, but, instead, stayed in Federal databanks. It is still in the \nFederal databanks. None of the information gathered in that \ninvestigation has been purged to this date. The rental and travel \nrecords of hundreds of thousands of innocent Americans remain in \nGovernment hands.\n  Las Vegas first; was there any place else? Did they go to the New \nYear's Eve celebration at Times Square in New York? Did they go to the \nwarm beaches of Florida snooping and spying?\n  I have three major concerns about this conference report. First, I am \ndisturbed the conference report provides neither meaningful judicial \nreview nor a sunset provision for those provisions regarding national \nsecurity letters. Instead of protections, this conference report \neffectively turns these NSLs, as they are referred to, national \nsecurity letters, into administrative subpoenas. For the first time, \nthe report authorizes the Government to seek a court order to compel \ncompliance with one of these letters. Recipients who do not comply \ncould be found in contempt, fined, or even sent to jail.\n  A third-party recipient, such as one of the Las Vegas hotels, could \ntheoretically challenge an NSL in court in order to protect the privacy \nof its customers, but the conference report makes it unlikely such \njudicial review will matter because the court is not required to find \nany individualized suspicion that the records sought are connected to a \nterrorist.\n  Second, I have significant concerns about section 215, often referred \nto as the library provision. Under a key provision in the Senate \ncompromise reached this summer, the Government would have been required \nto show that the records sought under this provision had some \nconnection to a suspected terrorist or spy. But under the conference \nreport we have now before the Senate, the Government may demand \nsensitive personal information of innocent Americans merely upon a \nshowing that the records are ``relevant'' to a terrorism investigation.\n  For example, the Government may be broadly suspicious of individuals \nin a\n\n[[Page S13692]]\n\nparticular immigrant community. Under section 215, the Government could \ngo to the library in that community and demand the records of library \ncardholders to see which individuals are reading what. What about \nsomeone reading scientific texts, maybe even Smithsonian or one of the \nmagazines people read dealing with automobiles, or Scientific American? \nAre these people considered terrorist threats?\n  A court challenge to a section 215 order must be conducted in secret. \nAt the Government's request, the recipient is not permitted to review \nGovernment submissions regardless of whether the Government has any \nnational security concerns in that particular case. Moreover, the \nconference report does not permit any challenge to the automatic \npermanent gag order under section 215.\n  Third, the conference report contains sections not included in either \nthe House or Senate bills limiting the right of habeas corpus in cases \nthat have nothing to do with terrorism. These provisions have not been \npassed by the Senate or the House. One provision would eliminate \njudicial review of whether a State has an effective system in providing \ncompetent lawyers in death penalty cases. That does not belong in this. \nSuch a far-reaching change should not be inserted in an unrelated \nconference report.\n  There are many other problems with the conference report that leaves \nlargely in place a definition of domestic terrorism so broad it could \nbe read to cover acts of civil disobedience. For example, a few days \nago we had members of the clergy who, believing that the budget before \nthe House and the Senate is immoral, were protesting, saying it is a \nbad budget. There were a number of arrests. Are these individuals to be \ndeemed domestic terrorists? They could be under the conference report.\n  The conference report still contains a catchall provision that \nauthorizes a government to conduct a sneak-and-peek search upon a \nshowing that notice would seriously jeopardize an investigation. Sneak \nand peek, what does it mean? It means they can go into your home, look \naround, see if there is anything that is incriminating, and then come \nback out and seek permission to use what they have obtained all without \ntelling you--which I believe is un-American.\n\n  As many critics of the bill have observed, a good prosecutor could \nfit about any search under this provision. I say ``good'' prosecutor \nany prosecutor. He wouldn't even have to be good.\n  The Justice Department reported 90 percent of the searches that have \ntaken place under sneak and peek under this act have nothing to do with \nterrorism. For these and other reasons, this conference report does not \nmeet the American standard. It certainly should not merit Senate \napproval.\n  Fortunately, we do not face the choice of accepting this conference \nreport or allowing the 16 PATRIOT Act provisions to expire. I am a \ncosponsor of S. 2082, introduced by Senator Sununu, to enact a 3-month \nextension of the expiring PATRIOT Act so we can take the time we need \nto produce a good bipartisan bill that will have the confidence of the \nAmerican people.\n  The majority leader said previously he won't accept such a 3-month \nextension. I hope, if we fail in invoking cloture, he would reconsider \nthis. I am confident in the end that it would be so much better that we \nextend this for 3 months to see if we can reach an acceptable goal.\n  Based on that, I ask unanimous consent the cloture vote be vitiated, \nthe Judiciary Committee be discharged from further consideration of \nSenator Sununu's bill, S. 2082, the 3-month extension of the PATRIOT \nAct, the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration, the bill be \nread the third time and passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection?\n  Mr. FRIST. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, with regard to the unanimous consent \nrequest, I need to be clear once again, and I have over the last couple \nof days, that I absolutely oppose a short-term extension of the PATRIOT \nAct. The House of Representatives opposes such an extension and the \nPresident will not sign such an extension. Extending the PATRIOT Act \ndoes not go far enough.\n  It is time to bring this to a vote this morning. We will see what the \noutcome of that vote is in terms of ending debate. I don't understand \nwhy opponents of the PATRIOT Act want to extend legislation at this \njuncture that has been fully debated, that has been the product of \nreasonable compromise and in a bipartisan way over the last several \nweeks and months.\n  With an extension, if that were to be the case, we would not be able \nto take advantage of the civil liberty safeguards that have been placed \nin the conference report, the additional provisions on protecting our \nports, on addressing money laundering by terrorists, protection of our \nrailways and mass transit systems, fighting methamphetamine abuse.\n  The PATRIOT Act represents a historic choice, a clear choice: Should \nwe take a step forward or should we take a step backward in keeping \nAmerica safe?\n  I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, through the Chair to the distinguished \njunior Senator from Mississippi, it is my understanding this is the \nKatrina matter we spoke about last night.\n  Mr. LOTT. It is, Mr. President.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would say to my friend, we are very close \nto being able to have that cleared on this side.

Mr. President, I rise today to mourn the passing and \ncelebrate the life of William Proxmire--a great Senator, a great \nWisconsinite, and a great man. It is particularly fitting that we pay \ntribute to Senator Proxmire during this first part of morning \nbusiness--time he virtually always controlled during his over 30 years \nin the Senate. He was a giant in the Senate in a time when this Chamber \nwas filled with giants. He followed his conscience, lived his \nprinciples, said what he thought, and thought more actively and deeply \nthan most.\n  Senator Proxmire came to the Senate in 1957, winning a special \nelection to fill the seat of Joseph McCarthy. Overjoyed at a Democratic \npickup in a narrowly divided Senate, Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson met \nProxmire at the airport to shake his hand. Two years later, Senator \nProxmire was on the floor of the Senate calling LBJ a ``dictator'' in a \nspeech dubbed by the press as ``Proxmire's farewell address.''\n  But that was Prox: independent, outspoken, and not at all afraid to \nchallenge conventions or conventional wisdom. In fact, there was very \nlittle that was conventional about William Proxmire.\n  He was a Democrat but not a reliable vote for the Democrats--or the \nRepublicans, for that matter. He was fiercely protective of consumer \nrights, civil liberties, and oppressed minorities all over the world--a \ntrue liberal Democrat on social issues. But he also had a legendary \nfrugal streak, perhaps a product of his Harvard business school \nbackground. He believed in the free market and business competition, \nand hated to see money wasted. His Golden Fleece awards and relentless \nscrutiny of Department of Defense procurement were renowned--and shamed \nthe powers-that-be into saving many hundreds of millions of taxpayer \ndollars.\n  He did not accept sloppiness or waste in Government or in the conduct \nof his own business and personal affairs. He started each day with \nhundreds of push-ups and a 5-mile run. He demanded of his office the \nsame sort of efficiencies he demanded from the rest of Government and \nreturned one-third of his office budget to the Treasury every year.\n  He was as disciplined as he was determined. He still holds the record \nfor most consecutive rollcall votes: 10,252 between April of 1966 and \nOctober of 1988. And there are colleagues still serving today who \nremember his daily morning business speeches on the Senate floor.\n  Most of these speeches were on the Convention on the Prevention and \nPunishment of the Crime of Genocide. This convention languished in the \nSenate for over 20 years, viewed as a lost cause by its few supporters. \nBut not William Proxmire. He gave a speech about the convention every \nday the Senate was in session from 1967 to 1986, when the convention \nwas ratified by the U.S. Senate by a vote of 83 to 11--3,211 speeches \nin all. One former staff member remembers that Senator Proxmire was \noften the only Member on the floor during his speeches, so he \nconcentrated on the Presiding Officer. So one by one, he reasoned and \ncajoled his captive colleagues into supporting this seminal human \nrights measure.\n  William Proxmire didn't only fight for his principles, he lived them. \nHe was the last of the true populist politicians, who took no campaign \ncontributions, spent virtually nothing on his campaigns, and shook the \nhand of almost everyone in the State of Wisconsin--whether they \nsupported him or not. Though he broke every rule of modern campaign \nstrategy, he won his reelections in landslides and was beloved by the \npeople of Wisconsin.\n  Senator Proxmire leaves behind his wife Ellen, five children, and \nnine grandchildren. He also is mourned by his Senate family, both those \nSenators who served with him and the members of his staff renowned for \ntheir professionalism, intelligence and loyalty. Neither Wisconsin nor \nthe Senate will see his equal again, and both are the poorer for his \npassing.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor to my colleague from Wisconsin, \nSenator Feingold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the senior Senator from \nWisconsin, my friend.\n  Mr. President, anybody who grew up in Wisconsin in the second half of \nthe 20th century regarded William Proxmire as a consummate Wisconsin \npolitical figure.\n  I rise, too, with great sadness to pay tribute to one of Wisconsin's \nand the Nation's great public servants. Senator Proxmire passed away \nearly yesterday morning at the age of 90. He was, simply put, a legend \nin Wisconsin, a man who represented the very best of our State, and who \nwill be remembered as one of the greatest advocates for a better \ngovernment, and a healthier democracy, to ever serve in this body.\n\n  On this very floor he railed against Government waste, and against \ncorruption. I think the American people can be grateful to Bill \nProxmire for so many things. But, perhaps most of all, we owe him a \ndebt of gratitude for his work to change the culture in Congress when \nit comes to wasteful spending.\n  He didn't buy into a culture that treats Government spending like a \ntab that someone else will pick up, that tucks pork-barrel spending \ninto bills late at night, or lets boondoggles slip by unnoticed. He \nknew that sunlight was the best disinfectant, and he wasn't afraid to \ntear down the drapes, throw open the windows, and let the sun shine in \non the legislative process. He didn't shy away from public outrage \nabout what was wrong with the system--he brought that outrage to bear \nas he fought to change the system for the better. Anyone who comes to \nthe floor today to try to put the brakes on a wasteful project, or to \ntry to push for budget discipline, can thank Bill Proxmire for the \nexample he set, and for the way he challenged the status quo.\n  I am not just grateful for what Bill Proxmire did for our State, and \nour country, but, frankly, for the many things that he taught me. He \nwas a tireless representative for our State. Watching Proxmire, you \ncouldn't help but learn how important it was to listen--really listen--\nto the people you represent, and how much you can learn from that \ngenuine exchange of ideas. When Bill Proxmire hit the campaign trail, \nit wasn't about a barrage of expensive ads. It was about connecting \nwith voters and giving them a chance to have their say--even when they \nsaid something you didn't agree with. As he once joked, ``The biggest \ndanger for a politician is to shake hands with a man who is physically \nstronger, has been drinking and is voting for the other guy.'' And he \nknew that from experience because nobody--nobody ever in the history of \nAmerican politics, I believe--shook more hands than Bill Proxmire.\n  And the people of Wisconsin loved him for it. After an early career \nof some tough defeats, once he won, he just kept on winning, with \nreelection margins of 71 percent of the vote in 1970, 73 percent in \n1976, and 65 percent in 1982, when he ran for a fifth 6-year term. \nIncredibly, in those last 2 reelection campaigns he was reelected \ndespite refusing contributions altogether. A lot of the money he did \nspend in his campaigns was on postage to return donations.\n  As somebody who wanted to run for public office myself, and as \nsomebody who kept being asked again, ``where are you going to get the \nmoney to run?'' Bill Proxmire gave me hope. His example helped me to \nbelieve that you can run on ideas, not just on money. And that example \ndidn't just help me in my run for office, it helped inspire me in the \nfight for the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform bill, and the \nongoing fight against the undue influence of money in politics.\n  His example of real shoe-leather campaigning went hand in hand with \nhis work on open Government. He didn't just want to be accessible \nhimself, he thought all of Government should be open and responsive to \nthe people it served.\n\n[[Page S13694]]\n\n  In this, as in so many things, he represented the true spirit of \nWisconsin, which pioneered laws in this area. He once said that ``Power \nalways has to be kept in check; power exercised in secret, especially \nunder the cloak of national security, is doubly dangerous.'' Today, as \nwe struggle for openness and oversight on national security issues, I \nthink his words have never been more true, and open, accountable \ngovernment has never been more important.\n  And then there's Bill Proxmire's lesson in courage. How many times \ndid he stand on this floor and say what needed to be said, truly \nrepresenting the people back home, saying what they would say if they \nstood here themselves, about boondoggle projects, or the importance of \nopen government? Here was a man who knew what mattered, and knew how to \nbring attention to a cause no one else was championing.\n  He was perhaps most famous for his Golden Fleece Awards, where he put \nthe spotlight on the kind of waste that, unfortunately, we still see \ntoo much of in the Senate today. While most members just let waste pass \nby unnoticed, Proxmire was unrelenting. Here are a couple choice \nexamples of Golden Fleece winners: To the National Institute of Dental \nResearch in 1984, for sponsoring a $465,000 study on the ``effects of \northodontia on psycho-social functioning''; to 190 Federal officials in \nSeptember 1982, for door-to-door chauffeur service costing $3.4 \nmillion; and to the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration in \nFebruary 1977, for a $27,000 study of why prison inmates want to \nescape.\n  I think that last one says it all about why the Golden Fleece awards \nstruck such a chord with the American public. There's a lot of numbness \nin Washington to wasteful spending, but Bill Proxmire wasn't numb to \nit. He was outraged by it. He had the innate aversion to waste that the \nAmerican people have, people who have to sit down at their kitchen \ntables, work out a budget, and decide what they can afford, and what \nthey can't. They think that if they have to do this, we should to. So \nSenator Proxmire stood up and demanded a little common sense, and a \nmeasure of discipline for the Federal budget. It was very courageous \nand very representative of the people who sent him here, I can tell \nyou.\n  This is a very sad day for our State. But it is also a day to reflect \non the Proxmire legacy, and to be proud of the impact he made on our \nstate, and on the Nation. He was a fighter, literally and figuratively. \nHe was a college boxing champ who managed to hold off two people who \ntried to mug him near the Capitol, and then helped in a dragnet that \nled to their arrest. He was a proud veteran, a newspaper reporter, and \na dogged campaigner who lost three races for office and was written off \nby a lot of people in Wisconsin politics before he won the race to fill \nthe seat of Senator Joe McCarthy after McCarthy died in 1957.\n  He was as determined as they come, it was that quality that served \nhim so well during his years in this body. It continued to serve him \nall his life, even as he fought a long and difficult battle against \nAlzheimer's disease.\n  His wife Ellen, his children and grandchildren are in all of our \nthoughts today. As we remember William Proxmire, and all that he did, I \nfeel deeply proud that he represented my State. He did great honor to \nthe State of Wisconsin by personifying the highest standards of public \nservice in this country. So I humbly honor his memory, and express my \ngratitude for his outstanding service to our Nation to our democracy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I join the Senators from Wisconsin in \npraising the late Senator William Proxmire. Neither of the Senators \ncurrently representing Wisconsin was in the Chamber when Senator \nProxmire was here. The distinguished senior Senator, Mr. Kohl, was \nelected in 1988, when Senator Proxmire retired. Senator Feingold was \nelected in 1992. I had the opportunity to serve 8 years with Senator \nProxmire. He was a powerful figure. He sat in the last row on the \nextreme right-hand side, the seat now occupied by Senator Rockefeller. \nHe was on the floor every day talking about genocide. He was the \nconscience of the Senate, the conscience of the Congress, the \nconscience of the country, really, the conscience of the world speaking \non that subject every single day.\n  He never missed a vote. I don't recollect exactly how many \nconsecutive votes he had, but I think it was in the range of 17,000 \nthat he never missed.\n  He had a record for minimal expenditures on campaigns for his own \nreelection. I recollect the average figure was about $173. That figure \nsticks in my mind as to what he spent to be reelected. There is some \nvariance on what it costs to be reelected today to the U.S. Senate, but \nhe was a towering figure. There ought to be more Senators on the floor \ncommenting about him. Even our senior Senator, Mr. Lott, was not \nelected until 1988 and Senator Gregg until 1992, so most of the \nSenators who are around today didn't have the advantage of working with \nBill Proxmire. There is a difference between knowing about him and \nactually seeing him in action and seeing him work. But he is a legend.\n  The Senators from Wisconsin have spoken eloquently about him. I \nwanted to add my voice in tribute to Bill Proxmire. He is still sitting \nin that chair. I still hear talk about the necessity to eliminate \ngenocide. That voice, once lonely, is now the predominant voice. A good \nbit of what he has said has been accepted around the world to the \nbenefit of humanity.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from New \nHampshire is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the 15 minutes \nwhich was to go to the majority for morning business be expanded a \nlittle bit and that 7 minutes be yielded to the Senator from Florida, \nthen 5 minutes to the Senator from New Hampshire, and then 7 minutes to \nthe Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Reserving the right to object, and I don't intend to, \nwhat is the business before the Senate now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is currently in morning business.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. And what time do we start the 1 hour prior to the \ncloture vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there is 15 minutes \nto be controlled by the majority at the present time. Then the Senate \nwill proceed to the debate on the PATRIOT Act.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. At that time, after this consent agreement, then the \nhour tolls prior to the cloture vote; am I correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The hour begins.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. And the time is divided?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. So just as a point of information, what time do we \nexpect that time will begin, if the pending request for time is agreed \nto and whatever time the floor leaders agreed to?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the pending request is agreed to, that \nwould be 20 minutes from now.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Florida is recognized for 7 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/16/senate-section/article/S13694-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13694-S13695]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             IRAQ ELECTION\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, yesterday we saw a historic day in Iraq. \nFor the third time in less than a year, the people of Iraq did what \nonly a couple of years ago would have been a dream: they voted in free \nelections. For those of us who have the appreciation of democracy as a \nresult of having lived where that is denied, the ink-stained finger, \nthe smiles, the celebratory atmosphere akin to a wedding is something \nto give us all hope.\n  Yesterday was a relatively trouble-free day. Seventy percent of \nIraqis voted. Poll stations were open for an extra hour because of such \nlong lines. The turnout was so good that ballot shortages were \nreported. This was clearly a successful day.\n  How does a date like this come to be? How do we go from a brutal \ndictatorship that threatens its citizens to a society of free \nelections? The answer is\n\n[[Page S13695]]\n\nthat it is about choices. Do people want a way of life built around \ntyranny, oppression, and terrorism, or do they want to embrace \ndemocracy, freedom, and prosperity? Clearly, the people of Iraq have \nchosen the latter. Yes, they have chosen the more difficult path, but \nthe rewards will be enormous.\n  I congratulate the people of Iraq for yesterday's historic elections. \nHistory will judge these elections to be pivotal, vital to building \ndemocracy, and part and parcel of our efforts in the war on terror.\n  As President Bush has highlighted in several recent statements, in an \nunbelievably brief period of time, Iraq has made tremendous gains in \ndemocracy and freedom. I commend the Iraqi people for these \nunprecedented strides.\n  The administration has outlined a clear strategy for going forward: \nthree key tracks--political, economic, and security--with realistic \nterms that avoid imposing unrealistic expectations and very dangerous \ntime frames.\n  I want to mention the story of a constituent of mine, a man who saw \nhis son go into the service of his country, who saw his son called to \nwar, and then sadly was here in Washington this week to lay that son to \nrest at Arlington National Cemetery.\n  Bud Clay of Pensacola shared a letter from his son, SSG Daniel Clay \nof the U.S. Marine Corps. Dan was one of 10 marines killed in Iraq by a \nroadside bomb in Fallujah. Knowing the danger he faced, knowing the \nunpredictability of war, Staff Sergeant Clay wrote a letter to his \nfamily to be opened only in the event of his death.\n  He wrote in part:\n\n       What we have done in Iraq is worth any sacrifice. Why? \n     Because it was our duty. That sounds simple. But all of us \n     have a duty. It has been an honor to protect and serve all of \n     you. I faced death with the secure knowledge that you would \n     not have to.\n\n  Staff Sergeant Clay writes:\n\n       As a marine, this is not the last chapter. I have the \n     privilege of being one who has finished the race. I have been \n     in the company of heroes. I now am counted among them.\n\n  He concludes by saying:\n\n       My race is over, my time in the war zone is over. My trials \n     are done . . . Semper Fidelis.\n\n  SSG Daniel Clay was laid to rest Wednesday at Arlington National \nCemetery. He is a hero. We honor his sacrifice, just as we honor the \nsacrifice of all those who have given so much in this war.\n  I conclude by again offering congratulations to the people of Iraq. \nCongratulations for going to the polls, for taking another significant \nstep forward for your own future, and for embracing that glimmer of \nhope that your country can be as free, peaceful, and prosperous as any \nother society that rejects tyranny and entrusts its government to its \npeople.\n  Soldiers such as Staff Sergeant Clay are sustaining the development \nof Iraqi forces. We owe them our respect, gratitude, and undying honor \nas we demonstrate unwavering determination to complete this mission.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, there is an irony today as we look at Iraq. \nAs democracy is flourishing, the Democratic Party in the United States \nhas tried to contract the democratic process by attempting to mute the \nNew Hampshire primary.\n  The New Hampshire primary is sort of the last best hope for the dream \nthat anybody can become President in this country. It is the last \nopportunity in this country for a person who is underfunded and who has \nnot been chosen by the Washington talking heads as a potential \ncandidate of purpose to have the opportunity to go somewhere and \nactually make an impact. Underfunded, nonrecognized candidates who have \nlegitimacy can succeed in New Hampshire and, therefore, interject \nthemselves into the opportunity to become President. And it has \nhappened time and again.\n  The argument that New Hampshire is not representative is belied by \nthe facts. Again and again, New Hampshire has reflected an opportunity \nfor people to come to New Hampshire, participate in the process, make a \nname for themselves, and move forward in the process.\n  Henry Cabot Lodge upset Nelson Rockefeller and Barry Goldwater there. \nEugene McCarthy and George McGovern upset the candidates who were \nperceived to be the sure-fire winners of their nomination, in fact, in \none case, a sitting President. Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton not only \ncame to New Hampshire and made a name for themselves as people not \nrecognized nationally but moved on to become President of the United \nStates. Even Ronald Reagan, arguably, might not have become President \nof the United States had he not had the opportunity to come to New \nHampshire and participate in the national debate where he said:\n\n       I paid for this microphone, Mr. Green.\n\n  More importantly, New Hampshire gives the people of this country the \nonly opportunity they have to test candidates for President one on one. \nWithout any script, without any prescreening, Presidential candidates \nhave to come to New Hampshire and go into living rooms, they have to go \ninto VFW halls, they have to go to Rotary clubs, and they have to go to \nunion halls. They have to answer questions from everyday American \ncitizens, and those questions are tough. Regrettably, time and again, \ncandidates have not lived up to that test.\n  So what we have today in the Democratic Party is an attempt by the \nkingmakers of that party to try to eliminate the threat of having the \nAmerican people actually meet their candidates and be tested by those \nquestions as they try to mute the New Hampshire primary process.\n  This was said extraordinarily well in an article ironically written \nby a professor in England who is a specialist on the American political \nprocess. He looks at New Hampshire as the last best hope to maintain a \npopulist approach to how we pick our Presidents in this country. Rather \nthan having to have lots of money to pay for campaigns in big States or \nlarge groups of primary States or have a national name recognition that \ncomes through having cozied up to the national press, a candidate can \ncome to New Hampshire with very little money, without national name \nrecognition, but with ideas, with purpose, with fire in their belly, \nand they can succeed in putting themselves and injecting themselves \ninto the Presidential process.\n  It would be a huge detriment to a fundamental element of the American \ndream, which is that if you have purpose, if you have substance, and if \nyou have a track record of success and have been a producer in our \nNation, you can continue that course and pursue the Presidency. It will \nundermine fundamentally the capacity of the American people to \nparticipate in the picking of a President if they don't have one place \nin this country where people who want to be President have to actually \nanswer questions from everyday Americans.\n  I certainly hope the Democratic Party will relent in its efforts to \ntry to crush this one element of democracy which is so critical to our \nentire democratic process.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article written by Roddy Keenan, a \nprofessor of American studies in England, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Concord (NH) Monitor, Dec. 16, 2005]\n\n      Even From Across the Pond, Primary's Beauty Is Plain To See\n\n                           (By Roddy Keenan)\n\n       Gary Hart had just won New Hampshire. The race for the \n     Democratic nomination had been turned on its head. And it was \n     all because of New Hampshire. To a 14-year-old watching the \n     news in Ireland, this was all unfamiliar to me. But on that \n     night in 1984, a fascination was born for a nation's politics \n     and for a picturesque snow-covered state in New England.\n       Now, 21 years later, the New Hampshire primary is under \n     attack. Watching from afar, I believe that attempts by \n     Democratic powers-that-be to dilute the primary come with \n     little justification, minimal forethought and an absence of \n     logic.\n       I can only imagine that those looking to create such \n     mischief have never witnessed the process or are fitted with \n     the blinkers of self-interest.\n       For these reforming politicians and officials deeming \n     themselves to be redressing an absence of inclusiveness and \n     decrying the unrepresentative nature of the primary, there\n\n[[Page S13696]]\n\n     can be no greater example of being divorced from reality.\n       In a nation where voter turnout is a major issue, the New \n     Hampshire primary has no such problem. Those casting \n     aspersions on the democratic relevance of New Hampshire \n     should look at their own states' turnout before denigrating \n     others. Moreover, the state's primary provides for a greater \n     show of grassroots democracy than caucuses do.\n       The proposals to add more early caucuses will only serve to \n     exacerbate the problem of front loading.\n       But it is the nature of the primary that I believe will be \n     the greatest loss to the nation's political and democratic \n     culture. In a college here in the United Kingdom, I teach \n     U.S. politics to students who receive their view of the U.S. \n     political system from various media. Big money, stadium \n     rallies and nonstop tarmac campaigns comprise the portrayal \n     they are presented with.\n       That's until I tell them of New Hampshire--of town hall \n     meetings, coffee klatches and earnest discussion, of living \n     rooms and factory gates in the snow, of genuine democracy in \n     action--the politics of people.\n       It is deeply ironic that in the week that saw the passing \n     of Eugene McCarthy, the future of the New Hampshire primary \n     is being challenged. His insurgent campaign in 1968 was a key \n     factor in the democratization of the system of presidential \n     selection.\n       It was only because of the unique character of New \n     Hampshire, its people's desire for serious political dialogue \n     and the democratic character of the state's primary that such \n     a challenge proved to be possible.\n       Long may it continue. Looking forward to seeing you in '08, \n     '12 and '16.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized for 7 \nminutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE.

Mr. President, I returned 2 days ago from Iraq. There was \nan article in yesterday's Hill magazine that was erroneous--there will \nbe a correction printed--where they inaccurately stated the number of \ntimes I have been over to Iraq. It has actually been 10 times. I have \nbeen doing this not because I am a member of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, but because I believe it is our constitutional \nresponsibility to see firsthand that our guys over there are getting \nthe equipment they need to prosecute the war, and they have been.\n  I want to share with you what happened the first of this week because \neven though the vote took place yesterday, on Thursday, the vote for \nthe Iraqi security forces actually took place on Monday and Tuesday. We \nhad a chance to go up there and visit with them.\n  The interesting point is, we saw this coming. There have been a lot \nof politicians coming back and talking about how bad things are over \nthere. I can't figure out where they get their information because as \nwe have been approaching these elections over the last few months, we \nhave noticed the IED incidents have been down 30 percent and suicide \nbombs have been down 70 percent.\n  There is a road that goes from where we get off the C-130s to go into \nthe Green Zone. Mr. President, you have been there. We were averaging \nabout 10 terrorist incidents on that road each week up until June. We \nhaven't had one since June. So we see all these good things are \nhappening, and then the unexpected quality of the training we are \ngetting for the Iraqi security forces. These guys right now--and I \nthink this is significant because people keep asking, What is the exit \nstrategy? I can tell you what I believe. One Senator believes we are \ngoing to be out.\n  Right now there are 214,000 Iraqi soldiers who are trained and \nequipped. At the end of this month, while we are drawing down--we are \ndrawing down probably 15,000 to 20,000 of ours troops--they are going \nto increase to 220,000. By the end of 2006, it is anticipated they will \nbe at 300,000. The goal is to get 10 divisions of Iraqi security \nforces. Ten divisions of Iraqi security forces equal 325,000 troops. \nThat will happen by July of 2007.\n  In terms of the way we are functioning now, we will be out of there, \nbut there will still be some troops there. We still have troops in \nKosovo and in Bosnia, but the heavy lifting will be over. They will be \ntaking care of themselves.\n  I see the incredible courage of these people. Up in Fallujah 3 nights \nago, I had all of the Iraqi security forces that had voted that day \ncome in. They were all rejoicing, and I said to them--this is kind of \nfunny. I said to them, through an interpreter: When is it going to be \nthat you are going to be able to be on your own without our support? Is \nthat going to be in the near future?\n  And they said: No, no--which broke my heart when I heard this. Then I \nfound out, in the Iraqi language, ``yes'' means ``na'am.'' So they are \nsaying, ``Yes, yes,'' and when they shake their head this way, it also \nmeans ``yes.'' Anyway, a little advice in case that happens to anyone.\n  These people are ready. They are so proud of the level of training \nthey have had. Keep in mind, this is in the Sunni triangle. These are \nthe Sunnis who are supposed to dislike us.\n  Several weeks ago, I was there and I met General Mahdi, who is in \ncharge of the Iraqi security forces in Fallujah. He had been in \ncharge--under Saddam Hussein he was a brigade commander. He hated \nAmericans until he started working with the Marines. He said he learned \nto love the Marines so much that when they rotated them out, they all \ngot together and they cried. That guy right now, General Mahdi, is now \nover the eastern one-third of the entire city of Baghdad. We do not \nhave our military there. It is all under Iraqi security. We have half \nof the city under security now. It is going to be up to 75 percent in a \nvery short period of time.\n  I think, when we see the successes--and even if that were not true, \nif one stops and realizes the bloody regime of Saddam Hussein, yes, the \ntargets for the terrorists right now are not Americans, they are \nIraqis, and they are killing some of the Iraqis, but when one stops and \nputs it on a chart, during the 10 years that Saddam Hussein had his \nbloody regime, on a monthly basis he was torturing to death more people \nthan the terrorists are killing today. When one looks at the way that \nthey have done it, the forms of torture, include gouging out of eyes, \nsevere beatings, electric shocks--there is a testimonial here about a \n3-month-old baby girl who was taken, and they gouged her eyes out in \nfront of the father, smashed her head and broke it open against a \nconcrete wall.\n  There is a lot of talk on the other side of this issue about prisoner \nabuse. We do not have prisoner abuse. The documentation is right here \nabout what they do with their prisoners. They will put them in \nshredders. If they are lucky, they will shred their head first. If they \nare unlucky, they will put their feet in there. This is what has been \nhappening over there, but it is all over now, and they are in charge of \ntheir own destiny.\n  I have enjoyed so much visiting with the members of Parliament who \nwere going to be up for election. This would have been on Wednesday, \nand they were going to be up the next day. One lady was quite outspoken \nand quite negative in terms of what her people were saying to her. I \nsaid: Did it ever occur to you 5 years ago that there would be an \nopportunity for a woman to serve in Parliament, let alone to talk the \nway you are talking? She stopped and said: You know, I think that is \nright.\n  So we are seeing such a change now in the attitudes. The polls look \nso good. The polls are showing that 70 percent of the people in Iraq \nare appreciative of the Americans being there. They want them to stay \nand get out when they are able to stand up on their own.\n  I met with the election commission, and to handle the election the \nway they did was totally unprecedented. We could never have predicted \nhow smoothly things would go. We talked to the people, and I want to \nparticularly pay tribute to IFES, the International Foundation of \nElectrical Systems. They have done a great job. They had people on the \nground, and they have truly been able to conduct an election that is \nactually comparable and better than many other mature countries, \nmaturing democracies. It has been a great success. I am rejoicing with \nall the people of Iraq today and with the people of America.\n  Lastly, I pay tribute to the brave people of Iraq who for the third \ntime this year have gone to the polls in record number to vote for a \nbrighter and more democratic future in Iraq. The early reports indicate \nthat across the 18 provinces of Iraq, Iraqis again turned out in \nmassive numbers to vote\n\n[[Page S13697]]\n\nin favor of a democratic Iraq. In doing so the Iraqis demonstrated to \nus all the importance of voting.\n  Earlier this week I was in Iraq and had the opportunity to see first \nhand the preparations for the historic election on December 15. I even \nhad a chance to witness some of the early voting that took place in \nIraq. It was a moving experience and one that demonstrated that the \ngreat sacrifice that America has made in Iraq helped to free people \nfrom tyranny and start them on the road to a democratic future.\n  While in Baghdad, I met with the Chairman of the Independent Election \nCommission of Iraq, IECI, Isadin Al Mohamaady and the members of the \ncommission. I had an opportunity to see first hand the extensive \npreparations that were being undertaken by the Iraqis. I was impressed \nby the sacrifice made by the members of the commission and their staff, \nmany of whom have paid the ultimate price for democracy with their \nlives. However, the spirit that I found in Baghdad, Fallujah, and \neverywhere I went, was one of determination, professionalism, and a \ndedication to making sure that Iraqis could freely select their future \nleaders at the ballot box.\n  It is important also to recognize the work of the International \nFoundation for Election Systems also known as IFES that has played a \ncritical role in helping advance free and fair elections in Iraq and in \n120 countries around the world. With the support of U.S. taxpayers, \nIFES was able to provide critical assistance that helped to make these \nelections possible.\n  I stand here to salute the brave Iraqis who at great personal risk \nsent an important message to the world about the triumph of the ballot \nover the bullet. Iraqis of all ethnic groups have joined together with \nunity and determination to freely choose their leaders in a free and \nfair election. They have sent a message around the world that the best \nway to defeat tyranny is at the ballot box, the source of power of the \npeople, by the people and for the people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/16/senate-section/article/S13697-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13697]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, yesterday I introduced S. 2117, which is a \nbill engaging our Nation to fight concerning our right to control \nentry. It is legislation that covers many aspects of the problem we are \nhaving on our very porous borders. One part of this is utilizing \nretired law enforcement officers. As many people know, national law \nenforcement officers have to retire at age 57. We learned of their \navailability after 9/11 when the Transportation Safety Administration \nand our office was inundated with calls from these brave law \nenforcement officers who are retired, saying that they wanted to \nparticipate in this activity, and they are willing to do it for costs. \nThe legislation I have introduced does include the very sophisticated \ntype of a fence that goes along the border between Mexico and the \nUnited States and also with an army of people who can join those who \nhave already demonstrated very clearly that if we have enough people \ndown there, we will be able to secure our borders.\n  I am cautioning any of our colleagues who are concerned about this \nissue not to be tempted to use military because right now our military \nis stressed. We have an OPTEMPO that is unacceptable as it is right \nnow. It should not be taking on other duties. Besides that, with the \nenactment of S. 2117, that would not be necessary.\n  Illegal immigration is at an all-time high, with around 1 million \nillegal aliens infiltrating our borders each year.\n  My legislation focuses on empowering our citizens and law enforcement \nofficers to fight this flood of illegal immigration.\n  First of all, I want to make it clear that I honor the millions of \nimmigrants that have come to this Nation, waited their turn, and gone \nthrough all the requirements to become American citizens to make our \ngreat country what it is today. I have spoken at many naturalization \nservices and seen what these people have gone through to become \nAmerican citizens.\n  I agree with the 1997 U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform that \nmeasured, legal immigration has ``led'' to create one of the world's \ngreatest ``multiethnic nations.''\n  I also agree with the Commission that immigrants who are \n``Americanized'' help cultivate a shared commitment to ``liberty, \ndemocracy and equal opportunity'' in our Nation. However, I cannot \nstand idly by and watch this great Nation collapse under the pressure \nof uncontrolled illegal immigration.\n  Roy Beck, Executive Director of Numbers USA, a non-profit \norganization dedicated to immigration reform, stated that ``a presence \nof 8 to 11 million illegal aliens in this country is a sign that this \ncountry has lost control of its borders and the ability to determine \nwho is a member of this national community . . . a country that has \nlost that ability increasingly loses its ability to determine the rules \nof its society--environmental protections, labor protections, health \nprotections, safety protections.''\n  Beck goes on to say, ``In fact, a country that cannot keep illegal \nimmigration to a low level quickly ceases to be a real country, or a \nreal community. Rather than being self-governed, such a country begins \nto have its destiny largely determined by citizens of other countries \nwho manage to move in illegally.''\n  My bill, the ENFORCE Act, works to solve the illegal immigration \nproblem in several ways. It will provide a way for more civilians and \nretired law enforcement officers to help the Border Patrol in stopping \nillegal border crossings and reduce the illegal immigration rate.\n  Through the creation of the National Border Neighborhood Watch \nProgram, NBNW, retired law enforcement officials called the Border \nRegiment Assisting in Valuable Enforcement, BRAVE, Force agents, will \ncome and work alongside Border Patrol agents. Civilian volunteers, much \nlike the now well-known Minutemen, will be able to report immigration \nviolations to assigned BRAVE Force agents.\n  The NBNW Program is modeled after the National Neighborhood Watch \nprogram, a collaboration between law enforcement, businesses, and \nconcerned citizens who watch for and report suspicious criminal \nactivity in neighborhoods to the local police.\n  The Neighborhood Watch Program has proven effective in reducing the \ncrime rate in areas where it is implemented. I am hopeful that the \nNational\n\n[[Page S13698]]\n\nBorder Neighborhood Watch Program will have the same effect in reducing \nillegal border crossings as the Neighborhood Watch Program has had in \nreducing crime.\n  I also believe that the BRAVE Force will provide significant \nassistance to the Minutemen, who are sacrificing their time and energy \nas they work to preserve our liberties and enforce our laws.\n  Another provision of the ENFORCE Act will make it a felony to be \nillegally present in the U.S.\n  Under current law, it is only a misdemeanor to be unlawfully present \nin the U.S. This means that if illegal aliens are caught in the U.S. \ntoday and are deported, most of the time, they can turn around and come \nright back into our country legally, without consideration of the fact \nthat they were previously in our country illegally.\n  By making unlawful presence a felony under the ENFORCE Act, when \ncaught, illegal aliens will be entered into the National Crime \nInformation Center, NCIC, database, a computerized index of \ncriminal justice information (i.e., criminal record history \ninformation, fugitives, stolen properties, missing persons), available \nto Federal, State, and local law enforcement and other criminal justice \nagencies. They will also be banned from legally entering the U.S. for 5 \nyears.\n\n  My bill will also establish another Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement, ICE, office in Tulsa, OK.\n  We only have one ICE office in the whole State of Oklahoma and this \nis not enough to do the job of enforcing our immigration laws. For \nexample, in September 2004, 18 illegal aliens were riding in a van in \nCatoosa, OK. The police pulled them over and found several illegal \nminors, as well as cocaine in the van. When the police called the ICE \noffice in Oklahoma City, ICE authorities told the officers to let the \nillegals go because ICE did not have the resources or manpower to take \nthem into custody. So Catoosa police let them go.\n  This is outrageous.\n  This year alone, 12 agents of the Office of Investigations of the \nBureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement served the 3,500,000 \npeople residing in Oklahoma.\n  Additionally, Highway I-44 and US-75 are major roads through Tulsa \nthat are used to transport illegal aliens to areas throughout the \ncountry.\n  We must provide our States and communities with the tools to arrest \nand detain illegal aliens. Creating a second ICE office in Tulsa, one \nof Oklahoma's largest cities, will help improve the lack of immigration \nenforcement in Eastern Oklahoma.\n  I would also like to note that my colleague, Congressman John \nSullivan, has introduced similar legislation to create an ICE office in \nTulsa. Not only do I believe adding another ICE office in Tulsa will \nhelp local and Federal law enforcement, I also believe providing \nspecific immigration training for law enforcement officers will help \nsolve our illegal immigration crisis.\n  Our State, local, and tribal law enforcement are experiencing \nincreasing encounters with illegal and criminal aliens during routine \npolice duties. The typical officer often does not know the law, policy, \nand procedures for determining immigration status or violations--apart \nfrom or in conjunction with other offenses--concerning alien \nlawbreakers.\n  As immigration continues to affect interior communities, a key to \naddressing situations that intersect with other law enforcement \ninvolves providing State, local, and tribal law enforcement officers \nwith basic training in immigration law and policy. Rather than \nexpending millions of dollars on traditional classroom training, this \nbasic training can be cost-effectively accomplished using the Internet.\n  Knowledge of basic immigration enforcement can complement law \nenforcement's core mission; should a local officer have strong reason \nto suspect other law violations without sufficient evidence to hold or \ncharge the alien on other offenses, immigration violations may \nconstitute sufficient grounds to hold a criminal.\n  This requires basic familiarity with immigration matters; therefore, \nthis provision authorizes $3 million for a demonstration project to \nestablish such an on-line training program through Cameron University \nin Lawton, OK. These funds will be used to develop and facilitate on-\nline training in basic immigration enforcement for up to 100,000 State, \nlocal, and tribal law enforcement officers in 6 to 8 States, similar to \nthe 4 hours of classroom training provided to all of Alabama's state \ntroopers in 2003.\n  This system will also provide, at the end of the demonstration \nproject, a ``return on investment'' study documenting the project's \ncost-effectiveness.\n  Not only are illegal immigrants increasing by crossing the border and \ndodging law enforcement officers, they are having ``anchor babies'' in \nrapid numbers.\n  Anchor babies are born to illegal aliens who come to our country and \nhave a baby who is then treated as a citizen because it was born on \nU.S. soil. These babies are helping the immigration population grow \nmore rapidly than the birth rate of American citizens.\n  In fact the Census Bureau estimates that at the time of the 2000 \nCensus, the illegal immigration population reached approximately 8 \nmillion. Therefore, according to this estimate, the illegal-alien \npopulation grew by almost half a million a year in the 1990s.\n  These numbers are derived from a draft report given to the House \nimmigration subcommittee by the INS that estimated the illegal \npopulation was around 3.5 million in 1990. In order for the illegal \npopulation to have reached 8 million by 2000, the net increase would be \naround 400,000 to 500,000 per year during the 1990s.\n  Furthermore, according to the Center for Immigration Studies, CIS, a \nnon-profit immigration reform organization, based on numbers from the \nNational Center for Health Statistics, in 2002 there were about 8.4 \nmillion illegal aliens, which represent about 3.3 percent of the total \nU.S. population. That same year, there were about 383,000 babies born \nto illegal aliens, which represents about 9.5 percent of all U.S. \nbirths in 2002.\n  In the Spring 2005 issue of the American Physicians and Surgeons \nJournal, Dr. Madeleine Pelner Cosman says, ``American hospitals welcome \nanchor babies.\n  ``Illegal alien women come to the hospital in labor and drop their \nlittle anchors, each of whom pulls its illegal alien mother, father, \nand siblings into permanent residency simply by being born within our \nborders.\n  ``Anchor babies are, and instantly qualify for public welfare aid.''\n  Between 300,000 and 350,000 anchor babies annually become citizens \nbecause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution which \nsays: ``All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and \nsubject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States \nand the State wherein they reside.''\n  These anchor babies are being used to enable their parents to skirt \nthe law, cross our borders, and bring in additional, illegal aliens. As \nthe law currently stands, because these children are considered \ncitizens, it creates an incentive for more aliens to illegally cross \ninto our country.\n  My bill will end this incentive by clarifying that only children born \nto citizens or legal permanent residents are considered citizens and \n``subject to the jurisdiction thereof.''\n  The ENFORCE Act will also address several issues including \nclarification of acceptable identification documents, verification of \nSocial Security numbers and benefits, clarification of the rights of \nlocal and state law enforcement officers concerning illegal immigration \nand construction of a fence along our southern border.\n  There is a growing problem regarding fraudulent identification, \nidentity theft and foreign-issued consular cards in our country. \nIllegal aliens often steal a person's identification, such as the birth \ncertificate of a deceased person, and use it to gain employment and \nother benefits.\n  My bill will help eliminate this fraud by establishing birth and \ndeath registries for localities to have the ability to check a person's \nidentification to ensure they are truly who they claim to be. It will \nalso require independent verification of birth records of people \napplying for a Social Security number.\n  The ENFORCE Act will clarify which identification documents can be \nused for official identification within the United States--such as \ndriver's licenses, passports, etc.--eliminating the use of consular \ncards for identification.\n\n[[Page S13699]]\n\n  Often, foreign embassies, within the U.S., will issue consular cards \nto their citizens who are in the U.S. These cards are unnecessary \nbecause the U.S. government either recognizes foreign passports or \nissues its own identification documents to foreigners who are legally \nin the U.S. The majority of consular cards have been found to be used \nas identification for illegal aliens and have been called an insecure \ndocument by the FBI and Department of Homeland Security.\n  Another provision in my bill will address Social Security benefits \nfor work performed by illegal aliens.\n  Under current law, former illegal aliens, who gain legal status, are \nable to receive Social Security benefits for the work they performed \nwhile they were illegal.\n  My bill will end this practice by not allowing anyone to collect \nSocial Security benefits for work performed while they were illegally \npresent in this country. Our Social Security system is already strained \nand faces bankruptcy. Allowing work performed by illegals to be counted \nand used to further drain our Social Security system must stop.\n  The ENFORCE Act will also address fraudulent use of the Individual \nTaxpayer Identification Number, ITIN.\n  The IRS created the ITIN in 1996 to improve tax administration \nbecause it needed a more efficient way to identify and track the tax \nreporting of non-citizens, such as foreign investors, who could not \nobtain a Social Security number when filing tax returns and other tax \ndocuments. ITIN applications can be mailed to the IRS, submitted at an \nIRS walk-in, taxpayer assistance center, or submitted through an \nacceptance agent.\n  A GAO testimony by Michael Brostek before the House Subcommittee on \nOversight and Social Security in March 2004 revealed that IRS controls \nfor the ITIN could be easily bypassed and that it could be used for \nnon-tax purposes, such as general identification. Mr. Brostek went on \nto testify that the ``IRS concluded that most resident aliens who have \nITINs and earn a wage income are not legally employed in the U.S.''\n  This creates many concerns about use of the ITIN by illegal aliens, \nwhich is why my bill will make the ITIN look physically different than \na Social Security number and not allow it to be used to obtain tax \ncredits.\n  Another issue my bill addresses is building a fence along our \nsouthern border.\n  It is known, according to government reports, that foreign nationals \nfrom countries such as Syria, Iran and Saudi Arabia have crossed our \nsouthern borders, not to mention the high number of illegal aliens from \nother countries.\n  According to We Need a Fence, an organization dedicated to ensuring a \nfence is built along our southern border, a CNN poll has shown that 87 \npercent of its respondents support building a security fence along the \nU.S.-Mexico border.\n  The ENFORCE Act will direct a high security, state-of-the-art fence \nto be built along our southern border to prevent illegal border \ncrossings. This fence will actually consist of two fences separated by \na patrol road, ditches, barbed wire, and surveillance cameras. While \nthe initial cost to build the fence is considered high by some, I \nfirmly believe it will result in savings in the long run by preventing \nillegal border crossings and eliminating the cost of finding, \narresting, detaining and deporting illegal aliens.\n  The ENFORCE Act will also make it illegal to establish day-laborer \ncenters and to assist illegal aliens in finding employment, much like \nthe sites that are set to be built for illegal aliens in Fairfax \nCounty, VA.\n  Earlier this year, the Fairfax County's Board of Supervisors voted \nunanimously to provide $400,000 in taxpayer funds to be used to build \nthree day laborer sites to assist illegal aliens in finding employment. \nIt makes no sense to not only ignore the large numbers of illegal \naliens gathering in one place, but to enable them to continue to break \nthe law by working in the U.S. and encourage others, such as employers, \nto break the law by helping illegals obtain jobs.\n  Another problem we face is educating illegal aliens.\n  Some states, such as Oklahoma, allow illegal aliens to receive in-\nstate tuition at colleges and universities. This is a slap in the face \nto out-of-state students who must pay higher tuition than illegal \naliens who have broken the law and do not even belong in our country. \nMy bill will address this problem so that illegal aliens will not be \nable to receive this benefit.\n  I would like to conclude by sharing a personal story regarding \nillegal aliens who commit crimes in the United States and then flee \nacross the border to Mexico.\n  Last May, my friend's son, Jeff Garrett, was tragically shot by an \nillegal alien while Jeff was turkey hunting in Colorado. After he shot \nJeff, the illegal fled to Mexico, where he is hiding today.\n  I know this story is just one among many about innocent Americans \nmurdered each year by illegal aliens who then find safe harbor in \nMexico.\n  I believe the ENFORCE Act will not only help prevent these criminals \nfrom coming across our borders, but is a good start to ending our \nrampant problem of illegal immigration in general.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in solving our immigration problem by \ncosponsoring the ENFORCE Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/16/senate-section/article/S13699-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13699-S13701]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   USA PATRIOT AND TERRORISM PREVENTION REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2005--\n                           CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of the conference report to accompany H.R. 3199, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Conference report to accompany H.R. 3199, an act to extend \n     and modify authorities needed to combat terrorism, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 60 \nminutes equally divided between the majority and the minority.\n  Who yields time? The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, we are approaching a vote to invoke \ncloture on the PATRIOT Act which will require 60 Senators to cut off \ndebate so that we can move ahead to a vote up or down on the act. The \nact, as is well known, is set to expire on December 31, 2005. When the \nJudiciary Committee, which I chair, approached the reauthorization of \nthe PATRIOT Act, we tackled it early in the year, and there was a \ncommittee bill, which I sponsored, which had remarkable success getting \na unanimous vote in the committee, which has Senators from both ends of \nthe political spectrum. It then came to the floor in a manner perhaps \nunprecedented: It went through by unanimous consent. There was no \ndebate. Not a single Senator objected. It was heralded as uniquely well \nbalanced, from the considerations of providing adequate tools for law \nenforcement to continue the fight against terrorism, which is vital for \nour national safety, and balanced to protect civil liberties.\n  Under our system of government, the Senate does not have the last \nword. I only wish that were so. We have a bicameral system. Then the \nlegislation has to receive the signature of the President.\n  We then went into negotiations with the House of Representatives. I \nagain thank and commend Chairman Sensenbrenner, who is the chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee in the House of Representatives, for working \nthrough some very difficult proceedings to come to a conclusion that a \nconference report could be signed and filed and voted upon by both \nHouses.\n  The House of Representatives has supported the conference report with \na 77-vote majority--very substantial. Now we have it in the Senate. The \nconference report was not signed by Senators when originally presented \non November 18, 2005. I declined to sign it because I wanted to work \nthrough and try to get the joinder of Democrats. It has been my \nexperience that the close relationship which Senator Leahy and I have \nestablished, working on the Judiciary Committee on a bipartisan basis, \nhas yielded significant positive results for the committee, for the \nSenate, for the Congress, and for the country. We have been able to \nwork through major legislation this year, passing class action reform, \npassing bankruptcy reform, voting out and confirming the Attorney \nGeneral very promptly, working through data privacy--a very tough \nlegislative bill\n\n[[Page S13700]]\n\nvoted out of committee; voting out of committee asbestos reform. People \nsaid that could not be done. It is going to be the first item on the \nagenda next year.\n  It was apparent to me that we needed to have a bipartisan approach. \nAs one Senator said on the floor yesterday in announcing that the \nSenator was going to vote against cloture--he had been a cosponsor of \nthe bill, but in the absence of this bipartisan support there was too \nmuch public confusion. The public cannot understand all of the \nintricacies of the PATRIOT Act, and the shorthand signal is, when \nDemocrats and Republicans agree, there is a modicum of confidence. \nRegrettably, we could not get it on this bill.\n  When the debate started earlier this week, I invited all Members to \ncome to the floor to state what their concerns were. I called many \nMembers to reach out to those I knew could use some elaboration and \nalso discussion for my benefit, and then from the floor repeatedly \nurged my colleagues to come to the floor, raise their concerns, let us \nhave a discussion. Perhaps we can satisfy their concerns. If not, we \ncan describe the bill and explain it so the people and the Senators \nwill understand it.\n  I do not think we have been successful in conveying to the public at \nlarge, and perhaps not even to the Senators, what this bill really \nprovides. In this morning's paper, one of the most prominent newspapers \nin the United States, they described the bill this way:\n\n     . . . the bill gives the government far too much power to \n     issue ``national security letters,'' demanding private \n     financial, medical and library records, without the \n     permission or oversight of a judge.\n\n  The writer of this editorial does not understand the basic tenets of \nthe bill. The writer of this editorial is mixing up section 215, which \nprovides for obtaining records--library records, medical records--with \nnational security letters. The bill is explicit in giving judicial \nreview.\n  At the present time, an agent can go out and, unilaterally, on the \nagent's own authority, get library records or medical records. One of \nthe principal safeguards in the PATRIOT Act, as passed by the Senate \nand as maintained by the conference report, has been to interpose the \nmagistrate, the judge, in between the policeman and the citizen, to see \nto it that law enforcement does not overstep its bounds; that \nlaw enforcement could get access on a showing of reason to do so, but \nthere is judicial supervision there.\n\n  One of the other most prominent newspapers in the country published a \nstory about 30,000 national security letters being issued, which is \nfalse. I cannot tell you what the facts are because it is classified. I \nhave tried to get the Department of Justice to come forward and say \nwhat the facts are. But repeatedly on the floor of the Senate we heard \nthis quotation: 30,000 national security letters--which is absolutely \nfalse. I beg my colleagues not to base their votes on what they read in \nthe newspapers but to get a briefing, find out what the facts are. \nSenators can find that out in a classified briefing, but do not rely \nupon the assertions in the newspapers or the assertion in today's \neditorial, which is just wrong as it describes what the act is.\n  On the floor of the Senate yesterday there were references to \nhometown newspapers saying hang tough.\n  Newspapers don't vote. Senators vote. Jefferson made one of history's \ngreat statements in saying if he had to choose between government \nwithout newspapers or newspapers without government, he would choose \nnewspapers without government. We do not have to make that choice. We \nhave both newspapers and government. And render under Caesar--the \nappropriate line. And let us look to the newspapers, let us consider \nwhat they have to say, but when they are wrong, let's not act on wrong \ninformation. Let's not act on wrong information. It is up to Senators \nto hang tough. We don't have to take instructions from the newspapers, \nas we heard yesterday, urging their United States Senator to hang \ntough. They don't vote. We vote.\n  A big, tough problem here has been to acquaint people with what this \nbill does provide. I am confident, if that has occurred sufficiently, \nthat this bill will be passed.\n  I have been on the Judiciary Committee during my entire tenure in the \nSenate and have demonstrated a strong record to protect civil liberties \non legislation which has come through the committee to the floor and in \nthe confirmation process. Nobody has a stronger record in this body \nthan I do. I will take second place to no one. There are many equals \nhere. Many in this body, I would say all in this body, are concerned \nabout civil liberties. But there is no mathematical equation where it \ncan be established, as to the balance between law enforcement and the \nbalance as to civil liberties. If you take a look at the specifics of \nthis legislation, that balance has been achieved. It may not be as good \na balance as the Specter-Leahy bill, which passed the Senate \nunanimously and without dissenting voice here, but it has balance.\n  I have already commented about section 215. There is judicial \nsupervision. And, on national security letters, they were not created \nwith the PATRIOT Act, but we took the occasion of the PATRIOT Act to \nput in safeguards on national security letters, which are in existence. \nIf the PATRIOT Act goes out of existence, you will not have section 215 \nto get certain records by law enforcement, but the national security \nletters are still there. But we took this occasion to provide for \njudicial review.\n  The recipient may consult a lawyer, who moves to quash the national \nsecurity letter if it is unreasonable. It may not be everything that \neverybody wants, but in legislation and the art of the possible, you \ndon't get everything that everybody wants.\n  Then you have the delayed notice warrants. A delayed notice warrant \nmeans that the judge has examined the situation and has given special \npermission that the law enforcement officials do not have to notify the \ntarget when the search and seizure warrant is executed.\n  Ordinarily, if there is a search and seizure warrant, the law \nenforcement officers go to the premise or an office and it is known to \nthe target, but where there are reasons to keep it secret because the \ndisclosure would impede an investigation, our laws have permitted for \ndecades a delayed notice warrant.\n  Then the concern was, How long should there be before notice is \ngiven? The Senate bill had 7 days, the House bill had 180 days, and we \ncompromised on 30 days. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals said that \npresumptively 45 days would be adequate.\n  The delayed notice requirement is illustrative of the vagaries of how \nyou have something in perfection. But when the Senate established a 7-\nday notice requirement, we knew we were going to meet in a negotiating \nsession, and I thought 30 days was a tremendous achievement for prompt \nnotification. The House came down 150 days, from 180 to 30, and we went \nup by 23 days.\n  Then there is the provision of the roving wiretaps which has been \ntightened up, as I explained in greater detail yesterday and earlier \nthis week--twice. There has to be a description of the individual who \nhas been intercepted, and there has to be a showing, to have a roving \nwiretap, that the person is going to resist the wiretap.\n  Then you have what is perhaps as important as any provision--I \nwouldn't say the most important, they are all important, but as \nimportant as any--sunset. The House wanted a 10-year sunset, the Senate \nsaid 4 years is what it ought to be, and the House was insistent on \ncompromising in between at 7 years, and we held fast at 4 years. It had \nbeen my expectation with good reason to believe that some Democrats \nwould sign the conference report if it came in at 4 years. It required \nassistance from the White House, and the President was personally \ninvolved in the 4-year decision--not to the satisfaction of the House \nconferees, but we got that done.\n  If you take a look at the specifics, if you don't get your facts from \nthe newspapers but instead get your facts from the Congressional \nRecord, if you get your facts from reading the statute, I believe a \nfair conclusion would be that it is balanced. It is nice to be the \nheroes of the editorial pages. It makes great hometown reading. We have \nhad quite a few comments on the floor of the Senate on the PATRIOT Act \nand on other acts citing the editorials and how pervasive, albeit \nsubtle, that influence is.\n\n[[Page S13701]]\n\n  I have only been chairman of the committee for less than a year, but \nI have come to see the vicissitudes of leadership. You don't have the \nfreedom to be the dissenter, to stand up and articulate your own views \nand to accept nothing short of what Arlen Specter has done or I am \ngoing to vote no. I have done that a few times when I have had greater \nfreedom, but if you are the chairman of the committee, you have to \ncarve out consensus.\n  In refusing to sign the conference report on November 18, 2005--to \nthe dissatisfaction of many people--but waiting until December to sign \nit, that was an effort to gain more negotiations and to try to satisfy \nmore people. My job was to get a consensus, was to work through what is \nthe art of the possible, to get a bill.\n  The six Senators who opposed the bill issued their press releases not \nbefore the ink was dry on the conference report but before the ink was \nfinished on the conference report. When I went to the press galleries \non December 8, 2005 to announce the conference report, before I got \nthere the dissenters had already issued their press releases. They \nweren't waiting to see what the conference report had to say. They did \nnot issue their objections before the ink was dry; they issued their \nobjections before the ink was finished. And you can do that if you are \na dissenter and if you are an objecter. But if you are the chairman and \nyou have the obligation to pull the parties together--and when I signed \nthe report on December 6, 2005 I still couldn't get some members of my \ncommittee to sign the report. They thought it went too far.\n  The President has taken the position that this conference report goes \nas far as he is going to go. I am advised that he issued a statement \nearlier today that he will not sign a 3-month extension. The majority \nleader said yesterday that he would not bring up a 3-month extension. \nThere may be ways to get it on the floor in any event. You can't amend \nthe conference report.\n  If I am given instructions in my capacity as chairman to go back and \nnegotiate, I will salute and go back and negotiate and try to work \nthrough whatever circumstances require. But where the President has \nsaid he is not going to sign a 3-month extension, if he means business, \nand I think he does, then in voting on cloture and in looking to a \nfinal vote up or down, this body is going to be faced with the \nalternative of either accepting the conference report, which is a \nbalanced bill, or, if not, the PATRIOT Act is going to expire, and the \nresponsibilities will be on those of us who vote and take positions.\n  Although we are a considerable distance from 9/11--more than 4 \nyears--terrorism continues to be a problem. This bill gives important \ntools to law enforcement in a balanced way. This bill has provisions to \nprotect subways, seaports, and airports. It is important that we have a \nbalanced bill, and it is important that we have a bill. There is no \nmathematical formula, but this bill is a balanced bill.\n  How much time remains of my 30 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eight minutes forty seconds.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, before I start, with the distinguished \nsenior Senator from Pennsylvania in the Chamber, I totally appreciate \nwhat he said about the problems of being the leader on a committee and \nhaving to make the decisions of how you are going to get a bill \nthrough.\n  I was chairman of the committee when we put through the first PATRIOT \nAct. I remember the balancing act we went through at that time and how \ndifficult it was to get a bill through. And that PATRIOT Act is this \nPATRIOT Act. It contains a number of items that I wrote.\n  I also note that throughout, the chairman and I have kept in very \nclose contact. We have spoken several times. I have considered during \nmy 31 years in the Senate that one of the things which has given me the \ngreatest sense of satisfaction is the relationship the distinguished \nchairman and I have in getting things through, and we have. I am \nconcerned because we have come so close on this.\n  As Senator Salazar noted, yesterday was the anniversary of the \nadoption of the Bill of Rights of the Constitution.\n  Yesterday we engaged in debate seeking to protect and reserve those \nrights under the USA PATRIOT Act. I thank Senators Sununu, Feinstein, \nCraig, Wyden, Feingold, Salazar, and Obama for their thoughtful \nremarks, their willingness to work in a bipartisan way which, after \nall, is the best tradition of the Senate.\n  Let all Members understand, this is a vital debate. The terrorist \nthreat to America's security is very real. It is vital we arm the \nGovernment with the tools needed to protect American society and \nsecurity.\n  At the same time, the threat to civil liberties is also very real in \nAmerica today. I do read the papers. Today's New York Times reports \nthat over the past 3 years, under a secret order signed by President \nBush, the Government has been monitoring international telephone calls \nand international e-mail messages of people inside the United States--\nwith no court approval, no checks and balances, one person's signature \nand that is it. This warrantless eavesdropping program is not \nauthorized by the PATRIOT Act, it is not authorized by any act of \nCongress, and it is not overseen by any court.\n  According to the report, it is being conducted under a secret \nPresidential order based on secret legal opinions by the same Justice \nDepartment lawyers, the same ones who argued secretly that the \nPresident could order the use of torture.\n  It is time to have some checks and balances in this country. We are a \ndemocracy. Let's have checks and balances, not secret orders and secret \ncourts and secret torture.\n  The debate is not about whether the Government should have the tools \nit needs to protect the American people. Of course it should. That is \nwhy, as I say, I coauthored the PATRIOT Act 4 years ago. That is why \nthe act passed with such broad bipartisan support. When I voted for \nthat PATRIOT Act, I did not think it was an ideal piece of legislation. \nI knew it would need careful oversight, but I was in favor of most of \nthe PATRIOT Act. I am in favor of most of the PATRIOT Act now. That is \nwhy I voted for the bipartisan Senate bill in July. The distinguished \nchairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee got it through our committee \nunanimously, with Senators from the right to the left voting for it.\n  This debate is not whether it should suddenly expire. Of course it \nshould not. That is why Senators from both parties have offered a bill \nto extend it in its present form for 3 months in order to give us time \nto either return to the bipartisan compromise we reached, pass the \nSenate bill, or reach a new bipartisan compromise.\n  Our goal is to mend the PATRIOT Act, not to end it. None of us want \nit to expire. Those who threaten to let it expire rather than fix it \nare playing a dangerous game. This is a debate about reconciling two \nshared and fundamental goals--assuring the safety of the American \npeople and protecting their liberty by a system of checks and balances \nthat keeps the Government, their Government, our Government, \naccountable.\n  America can do better. And we should. Those goals are not the goals \nof any particular party or ideology. They are shared American goals.\n  How to balance security with liberty and Government accountability \nwas the most fundamental dilemma with which the Framers of our \nConstitution wrestled. How to adjust that balance with the post-\nSeptember 11 world is the most fundamental dilemma before this \nCongress.\n  No one should doubt those who vote for cloture on the conference \nreport care deeply about the liberty of the American people. We all do. \nNo one should doubt that those who vote against cloture are devoted to \nprotecting both the security and liberty of the American people. We all \ncare deeply.\n  However, let us have a Government of checks and balances. In the long \nrun, we are more secure. Our liberties are more secure. Frankly, we are \nmore American in doing that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed \nto immediate consideration of Calendar No. 328, H.R. 4440.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 4440) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986 to provide tax benefits for the Gulf Opportunity Zone \n     and certain areas affected by Hurricanes Rita and Wilma, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this amendment 2680 acts on our \ncommitment to provide rebuilding assistance to areas of the country \ndevastated by this year's relentless hurricane season. It will benefit \nresidents of the gulf region, as well as more recently impacted areas \nof Texas and Florida, and provides much needed relief and resources for \neconomic rebuilding to those areas.\n  As promised, we have made our best effort to marry up our compassion \nfor displaced persons and damaged communities with attention to fiscal \ndiscipline and the best use of taxpayer dollars. This bill represents \nan effort to most efficiently and effectively use the tax code to \nassist in the rebuilding and revitalization of those regions. I will \nreiterate the guiding principles of our hurricane relief legislation. \nFirst, because market forces will be the driver in getting these \nregions back on their feet, our bill includes only provisions that \nencourage and incentivize redevelopment. Second, our package provides \nresources only to those who incurred uninsured losses and does not \nprovide for a bailout of those who assumed risk as an insurer in our \ncapitalist, free-market system. Third, we have focused our limited \nFederal resources on those most in need--like the many devastated small \nbusiness employers who were the backbones of these economies and who \nwill be the engines of their future growth and prosperity. The \namendment provides front-loaded incentives on a timely basis to \nencourage people and businesses to return to the region as quickly as \npossible.\n  I want to show my appreciation to my colleagues in the Senate and in \nthe House for working to get this legislation to the President as \nquickly as possible. Before we go home to spend time with our families, \nit is important for us to help the many families who have had their \nlives overturned by the recent hurricanes. Hopefully they will think of \nthis holiday season as a time of rebuilding and opportunity.\n\n[[Page S13703]]\n\n  The amendment also includes tax technical correction provisions \nrelated to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 and other tax \nlegislation. Technical corrections measures are routine for major tax \nacts and are necessary to ensure that the provisions of the acts are \nworking consistently with their original intent, or to provide clerical \ncorrections. Because these measures carry out congressional intent, no \nrevenue gain or loss is scored from them.\n  The process and test for technical corrections ensures that only \nprovisions narrowly drawn to carry out Congressional intent are \nincluded. Technical corrections are derived from a deliberative and \nconsultative process among the congressional and administration tax \nstaffs. That means the Republican and Democratic staffs of the House \nWays and Means and Senate Finance Committees are involved as is the \nTreasury department staff. All of this work is performed with the \nparticipation and guidance of the nonpartisan Joint Committee on \nTaxation staff. A technical enters the list only if all staffs agree it \nis appropriate.\n  The Senate Finance Committee and the Committee on Ways and Means, in \nconsultation with the Joint Committee on Taxation and the Department of \nthe Treasury, are continuing to assess proposals for other technical \ncorrections which may be needed to achieve congressional intent. On \nthat point, no double benefit is intended under the railroad track \nmaintenance credit of code section 45G. If the current basis adjustment \nrule is not serving to carry out that intent, the provision may need to \nbe clarified. Such a clarification might provide that basis or tax \nattribute reduction applies to the taxpayer taking the credit. I would \nlike to ask the staff to work on this.\n  In conclusion, this package will show those affected by Hurricanes \nRita, Wilma, and Katrina that their needs have not been forgotten, and \nthat we will continue to help them rebuild their homes, communities, \nand lives.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, shortly, we will complete legislative \nbusiness and adjourn for the year. Senators will leave to spend the \nholidays with our families. Senators will travel to the comfort of our \nhomes.\n  But there are still those in the gulf region who do not have homes.\n  Hurricane Katrina struck almost 4 months ago. We cannot, in good \nconscience, conclude our action for the year without passing tax relief \nfor the gulf region.\n  The legislation before us today is a good bill. We must pass it \ntoday.\n  In September, I was pleased that Congress could come together and \nquickly pass emergency tax relief for victims of Hurricane Katrina.\n  Prior to passing that legislation, I promised that I would work with \nmy colleagues to draft a long-term tax relief package. And that is what \nwe did.\n  We worked to create legislation that would help rebuild homes and \nbusinesses. We worked to create legislation that would pump money into \nlocal economies. And we worked to create legislation that would help \ndistressed working families.\n  We must come together again. We must pass this legislation today.\n  On November 18th, the Senate passed the tax reconciliation bill. We \nincluded Hurricane tax relief. We included Alternative Minimum Tax \nrelief. And we included more than a dozen important tax provisions that \nexpire on December 31st, including the Work Opportunity Tax Credit and \nthe Research and Development Tax Credit.\n  With the help of many, Chairman Grassley and I fit all of that \nlegislation within the constraints of the budget resolution's \ninstructions.\n  But the House did not take up our bill. Instead, the House passed \nhurricane relief and Alternative Minimum Tax relief outside of the \nbudget reconciliation process. Then the next day, the House passed a \ntax reconciliation bill.\n  Why did the House need three bills to achieve what the Senate \nsucceeded in passing in one bill?\n  The reason is simple. The reason is the capital gains and dividends \ntax cut.\n  I am disappointed in the House. I am disappointed that Congress could \nnot pass all the important tax relief that the Senate did in one bill.\n  And that is why we have the legislation before us today, the House \nhurricane tax relief bill.\n  The amendment that Chairman Grassley and I have crafted to this bill \nrecognizes that to revitalize the gulf region, the region must have a \nstrong economy. We must encourage individuals to return. And that means \nthat there must be jobs for them to return to. This legislation gives \nbusinesses help to create those jobs.\n  We would provide bonus depreciation. We would increase small business \nexpensing limits. We would also provide new authority for tax-favored \nprivate activity and mortgage bonds.\n  We would also extend to victims of Hurricanes Rita and Wilma some of \nthe tax relief that we provided to victims of Hurricane Katrina in \nSeptember. This includes penalty-free early tax-free withdrawals from \npensions and IRAs. We would allow victims to fully deduct casualty \nlosses. And we would remove the cap on allowable corporate charitable \ncontributions made in response to the hurricanes.\n  And thanks to the hard work and persistence of the good Senators from \nFlorida and Texas, we have been able to forge an agreement to provide \nextra low-income housing benefits for the Rita and Wilma hurricane \nzones. My good friend from Florida, Senator Nelson, has made \nthe convincing case that these devastated areas need more assistance \nwith low-income housing, and I am pleased to say this bill will be \nproviding that very help.\n\n  The substitute that Senator Grassley and I offer today provides $8 \nbillion in tax relief for the gulf region. We take the House bill, but \nwe provide additional tax relief for employers and students to \nencourage people to return to the gulf region.\n  One item of particular importance to me is tax relief to employers \nwho continued to pay their workers after the hurricanes struck. \nEmployers located in the Katrina, Rita, and Wilma disaster zones will \nbe able to take up to a $2,400 tax credit on wages paid to employees \nduring the period the business was shut down. These business owners \nhave tapped into their savings to help out their workers. They deserve \ntax relief. We provided this relief in our first bill, but it was \nlimited to small employers. I have always felt and argued strongly that \nany employer that helps out their workers while the business is shut \ndown deserves this assistance. I am very pleased that we were able to \neliminate this cap, and extend this relief for the Rita and Wilma zones \nas well.\n  Another priority item for me is a provision to encourage students to \nreturn to the gulf region. Many colleges and universities were forced \nto shut down after Hurricane Katrina and students have been scattered \nacross the country. To encourage these students, and new students as \nwell, to come back to the gulf region, we double the Hope Scholarship \nand Lifetime Learning tax credits. Students from around the country \nwould be able to take a credit up to $4,000 for tuition, room and \nboard, books, and fees for attending college in the areas affected by \nHurricane Katrina. I was very pleased that we could include this \nbenefit in our Senate version and that we have retained it in this \nsubstitute. I think it will be extremely valuable to the colleges and \nuniversities who have really suffered from this hurricane.\n  One further priority item for me is the additional $1 billion in new \nmarkets tax credit authority for the Katrina zone. I fought to get this \ncredit in our Senate version because I am convinced this program works. \nThe program provides access to capital for small businesses through \nestablished community development entities. Entities with a significant \nmission of rebuilding in the hurricane zone may access these additional \ntax credits in order to help these struggling businesses rebuild. These \nbusinesses may not be able to utilize some of the other tax benefits in \nthe bill, but access to capital will help many of them stay in business \nand stay in the zone.\n  One last item that I would like to highlight is an employer credit \nfor providing housing for workers and their families. My good friend \nfrom Louisiana, Senator Landrieu, offered this provision during our \nfloor debate last month. And if I could just take a moment to point out \nto our colleagues the tremendous work she has done on this bill. She \nhas truly been our compass during these negotiations and has been \nessential in conveying the true plight of her constituents.\n\n[[Page S13704]]\n\n  She has told me about the many hurricane victims who still do not \nhave housing in the gulf region. Under her provision, workers and their \nfamilies receiving housing from their employers could exclude up to \n$600 a month from their income for tax purposes, plus the business can \nreceive a partial credit for this expense. Business leaders have told \nus that they simply cannot get back to work unless their workers have \nhousing. The Landrieu housing provision helps them immensely.\n  Finally, this bill provides that soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan may \ninclude combat pay when calculating their earned income tax credit. \nThis has been a priority item for our friend from Arkansas, Senator \nPryor, who championed this fix for our military families serving in \ncombat last year. We extend the benefit for another year in this \nsubstitute and I commend Senator Pryor for his tireless work on behalf \nof military families.\n  We have a good bill before us. It has been nearly 4 months. We are \nset to adjourn the Senate for the year. We need to come together and \nhelp those most in need. I urge my colleagues to pass this legislation \ntoday.\n\n\n                             animal racing\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for working with me \non an issue of importance regarding the applicability of the animal \nracing facility limitation contained in the Senate amendment to H.R. \n4440. I understand that the legislative language creates new section \n1400N(p) of the Internal Revenue Code which indicates that property \ndirectly related to animal racing is not eligible for certain benefits \ncontained in certain subsections of new section 1400N. My understanding \nis that items not directly related to the racing of animals or the \nviewing of such races, such as barns, stables, practice facilities, \nrestaurants, some administrative offices, gift shops, and parking areas \nare eligible for these benefits.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank the Senator for that clarification. His \ndescription is correct.\n\n\n            employee retention credit--tax-exempt financing\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, because there is no committee report \naccompanying this legislation, I would like to engage Chairman Grassley \nin a colloquy to clarify the intent of two provisions contained in this \nimportant legislation.\n  First, among the tax benefits contained in this package is the \nemployee retention credit. This incentive will play a pivotal role in \nhelping businesses retain their employees even it they are temporarily \nout of business while the gulf coast rebuilds. As I understand the \ncommittee's intent, the credit will apply both where a company is \ncompletely out of business, and where it did not suffer total \ndevastation to its trade or business operations. For example, the \ncredit would apply in cases where one part of the operation in the \ndesignated zone was rendered ``inoperable'' while another location of \nthat same business continued to operate. Is that correct?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I agree with Senator Lott's interpretation of this \nprovision of the bill.\n  Mr. LOTT. Another provision of H.R. 4440 would make eligible for tax-\nexempt financing the costs of nonresidential real property located in \nthe Gulf Opportunity Zone. It is my understanding that the intent of \nthis provision is that nonresidential real property includes any \ntangible property other than fixtures and equipment that are movable, \nwithout regard to the class life of such property or its use as part of \nmanufacturing, production, or extraction, or of furnishing services or \nproperty.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I agree with Senator Lott's interpretation of this \nprovision of the bill.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to raise an issue of \nconcern with the Katrina tax relief bill, known as the Gulf Opportunity \nZone. This bill quite rightly provides incentives to bring back \nbusinesses and capital to the devastated regions of the gulf coast. \nThis package is needed legislation that will continue to drive \nredevelopment and provide encouragement for businesses and others to \ncome back and rebuild, creating jobs in the rebuilding and jobs in the \nbusinesses themselves and providing much needed revenues for the local \ncommunities.\n  However, I have raised a concern to my colleague from Mississippi \nregarding providing incentives to certain industries such as casinos. I \nread with interest an article in the New York Times on December 14, \n2005, regarding the return of casinos to the gulf coast. The article \nnoted that while the storm damaged 9 out of 10 casinos in Biloxi, MS 3 \nof the 9 damaged would be open again before the new year. In fact \n``[a]ll 10 Biloxi casinos have told the city they will rebuild, and \nmost plan larger, more elaborate facilities.'' Clearly, the casinos and \ngaming industry do not need Congress to give them tax breaks to entice \nthem to reopen.\n  More importantly, there are significant concerns about the impact of \ngambling on communities and families. In 2000, the Government \nAccountability Office found that ``individuals suffering from \npathological gambling engaged in destructive family behavior, committed \nmore crime than other citizens, and had higher suicide rates.'' It also \nfound the ``destructive family behavior'' included domestic violence, \ndivorce, and homelessness. Additionally, GAO ``also reported that \nchildren of individuals suffering from pathological gambling are often \nprone to suffer abuse and neglect.'' As we look at soaring costs for \nsocial programs and ever-increasing needs, it is most troubling that \nthis report noted that ``lifetime pathological, problem, and at-risk \ngamblers are more likely than low-risk or nongamblers to have been \nalcohol or drug dependent'' and estimates that ``15 million adults are \nat risk of becoming problem gamblers.''\n  With the heartbreaking impact this industry has on some of our most \nvulnerable citizens, I am pleased that my colleague from Mississippi \nhas recognized my concern and offered a package that ensures the \nnecessary economic assistance for his State and communities without \nexacerbating the social toll on these already devastated communities \nand families.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the expeditious passage of this bill. \nI am hopeful our House colleagues will then adopt this bill and send it \non to the President's desk so we can get this help out to these States, \ncommunities, businesses and families before the new year. Then \nhopefully the Congress can turn its attention back to the Tax Relief \nAct and enact its charitable incentives to help the countless \nnonprofits working day and night to heal the wounds in Katrina's wake. \nThat element of the tax bill is critical, and we should move forward on \nthis bill in short order.\n\n\n                    EITC and CTC for Katrina Victims\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. As we consider this legislation to provide tax relief to \nrespond to Katrina, it is particularly important that we recognize the \nimpact of the hurricane on those struggling working families who are \neligible for the earned income tax credit and the child tax credit. I \nam particularly concerned that the disruptions and displacement \naffecting these families in both their jobs and their homes may make it \nmore difficult for them to receive these critical tax credits to which \nthey are legally entitled--credits which they need more than ever. Some \nfamilies will become eligible for these credits for the first time, yet \nmay not be aware of these programs let alone how to apply for them. In \naddition, we have seen a tremendous outpouring of support for those hit \nby Katrina from families and friends of the victims, often at great \ncost. These relatives and friends may also qualify for assistance but \nfind it more difficult to meet all the normal requirements.\n  For example, there are many families who have taken in nonrelative \nchildren displaced by the hurricane. They are essentially foster \nparents but may not be considered as such under current law. Due to the \nneed to act quickly in response to Katrina, these foster children will \nnot have been formally placed by an authorized agency but under current \nrules, such individuals could not claim these children for the EITC or \nthe child tax credit. This would be true even if they continued to care \nfor the children for more than 6 months in 2006 and thus meet the \nqualifying child residency requirement.\n  The only potential relief such individuals have is the $500 \nadditional exemption in 2005 for housing a Katrina survivor more than \n60 days provided in the Hurricane Katrina Emergency Tax Relief Act, \nHKTRA. However, this is a\n\n[[Page S13705]]\n\nminimal support for a family taking in a child as a member of the \nfamily. In addition, the exemption is unavailable to low-income \nfamilies with no income tax liability.\n  Taxpayers caring for such children may ultimately seek to formalize \nthe arrangement with an authorized agency during 2006, but a placement \ndecision may not be reached until later in the year. If only the time \nin residence with a child after the placement decision is considered \nfor the purposes of meeting the residency test, the taxpayer may be \nunable to meet that test for the EITC and CTC. Some low-income \ntaxpayers, unaware of the EITC or CTC rules, may simply continue to \ncare for the child in their family and not pursue a formal arrangement \nuntil a later point and yet may be counting on the income from these \ncredits.\n  Clearly the IRS needs to address this problem.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I share concern with the impact that Katrina will have \non the ability of low wage working families who qualify for the child \ntax credit and the earned income tax credit to receive them for the \n2005 tax year. In addition, I certainly agree that something must be \ndone to address this problem for families who generously gave of \nthemselves and took in a child displaced by Katrina but may lack the \nproper formal authorization that would prevent them from receiving the \nEITC they qualify for and would otherwise get.\n\n  To help address this problem, I would urge the IRS to accept a child \nplacement decision by an authorized agency as being retroactive to the \nearliest point in 2006 when the taxpayer first took in the child. This \nwould apply only to children who had resided in a hurricane disaster \nzone in 2005 as defined under HKTRA and under any subsequent \nlegislation extending HKTRA provisions to Rita and Wilma survivors.\n  I have been advised that the IRS has the ability to adopt this \napproach under section 407 of HKTRA and any equivalent extension to \nRita and Wilma survivors--that enables the Secretary to make \nadjustments in application of rules to ensure that hurricane survivors \ndo not lose tax benefits. I know my colleague from Montana joins me in \nurging the IRS to use this authority to help these foster care families \nwho so generously took in children displaced by Katrina.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I wholeheartedly agree with my friend from Iowa.\n  I would like to raise another concern regarding these tax credits and \nthe Katrina families.\n  As we approach the next filing season, there are so many families \naffected by the hurricane who previously received the EITC and the CTC \nbut now face significant confusion about whether they will get the \ncredit and how much they will receive. And, of course, some of the \nnormal sources of taxpayer assistance in the gulf are not available \nnow. Accordingly, it is exceedingly important the IRS do everything it \ncan to maximize information and assistance provided to the public to \nhelp those eligible secure these credits.\n  While we wrote section 406 and section 407 of the Hurricane Tax \nrelief bill to help eligible hurricane survivors receive the benefits \nof the EITC and CTC, it is really up to the IRS to effectively inform \ntaxpayers and the tax preparation community of how the provisions are \nbeing implemented. In particular, section 407 provides that the IRS ``. \n. . may make such adjustments in the application of the internal \nrevenue laws as may be necessary to ensure that taxpayers do not lose \nany deduction or credit or experience a change of filing status by \nreason of temporary relocations by reason of Hurricane Katrina.''\n  I understand that the IRS is working to decide how this ``adjustment \nauthority'' will be implemented and is preparing a new Publication \n4492. However, low-income taxpayers and those who assist them in the \npreparation of their 2005 tax returns will need to understand the \nnature and limits of the adjustments IRS is willing to make so that \nreturns are prepared properly. It will take a very thorough and \ncomprehensive public education program to make sure that nontechnical \ninformation is made available through various means to help educate the \npublic and those who help prepare tax returns. I am very concerned that \nthe IRS take every possible step it can to make sure eligible low-\nincome working families affected by Katrina know about special \ntemporary adjustments to these credits and what they need to do to \nensure they receive these credits.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I agree that many eligible hard-working families who \nqualify for the EITC and the child tax credit but whose lives have been \nsharply affected by the hurricane may face particular challenges and \nhurdles in applying for and receiving these credits. I also concur that \nis incumbent upon the IRS to take all steps it can to ensure that the \npublic and the tax preparation community have clear, detailed, and \nunderstandable information about any adjustments and modifications it \nmakes to help Katrina victims who qualify for the credits get them.\n  I believe that the IRS should report to Congress within the next \ncouple of weeks the action it has taken to implement the provisions of \nsection 406 and section 407 HKTRA, pertaining to the EITC and CTC, \nincluding outreach and communication efforts undertaken by IRS to \ninform taxpayers, tax practitioners, and volunteer tax preparation \nprograms of these provisions, including the guidance provided to them \nby IRS on how the flexible authority to IRS in section 407 is being \ninterpreted and implemented. IRS should publish such guidance, \nincluding typical questions and answers, in formats that are accessible \nto taxpayers, commercial tax practitioners, volunteer tax preparer \norganizations and low-income taxpayer clinics, including but not \nlimited to the IRS Web site.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Chairman and join in his recommendations to \nthe IRS.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I commend Senate Finance Chairman Grassley \nand Ranking Member Baucus for putting together a bipartisan bill that \nwill provide tax relief to individuals and businesses who are \nstruggling due to the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. This legislation \ncreates a gulf opportunity zone in those areas in Alabama, Louisiana, \nand Mississippi that were hardest hit by the hurricane. Businesses \noperating in this zone will be eligible for specified tax breaks. In \naddition, the legislation provides relief to help with housing and the \ncost of higher education.\n  I support providing businesses with the appropriate tax relief that \nwill help them rebuild. However, I am concerned that this tax relief \nwill not be helpful if we do not provide assistance to small \nbusinesses. If the assistance to small businesses continues at its \npresent pace, tax relief will be somewhat meaningless. Currently, 74 \npercent of hurricane-related Small Business Administration, SBA, \ndisaster business loan applications have not even been processed, and \nless than 10 percent of the approved business loans have been fully \ndisbursed. I have introduced legislation that would allow the affected \nStates to distribute $450 million in bridge loans to help businesses \nthat are waiting for an SBA loan to begin rebuilding immediately. If we \ndo not provide businesses with loans, they will not be able to rebuild \nand benefit from these tax incentives.\n  I am pleased that this legislation includes a provision that would \nextend the current law provision that allows military personnel the \noption of treating certain combat pay as earned income for the purpose \nof computing the earned income tax credit, EITC, for 1 year. I have \nintroduced legislation that strengthens the EITC. It includes a \nprovision to allow permanently military personnel to elect to treat \ncertain combat pay as income for purposes of calculating the EITC. \nDuring the debate on S. 2020, the Tax Relief Act of 2005, I along with \nSenator Obama offered an amendment on the EITC that would have extended \nthis provision through 2007, but it was subject to a point of order \nbecause it included outlays.\n  This provision should be made permanent, but it is important that we \nare not allowing it to expire. It is a commonsense provision that would \nprevent members of the armed services from losing their EITC when they \nare mobilized and serving their country. Military families are often \nfaced with increased expenses when a loved one is deployed. Thousands \nof reservists, for example, take a cut in pay when they are called to \nactive duty.\n  Without this extension, several military families that are benefiting \nfrom\n\n[[Page S13706]]\n\nthe EITC would not longer be eligible for the credit. Eligibility for \nthe EITC is based on income, and certain combat pay does not count as \nincome for tax purposes. The election included in this provision would \nallow military personnel to choose whether they want their combat zone \npay to count as income for purposes of calculating the EITC.\n  This provision will help military families with some of their \nfinancial burdens. It does not repay the sacrifices that they are \nmaking for us, but it shows that we are supporting our troops at home \nas well as abroad.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to thank Chairman Grassley and \nSenator Baucus for their commitment to enacting a long-overdue tax bill \nthat will help get cash back into the pockets of businesses and \nindividuals who are rebuilding their lives and their communities in the \nwake of hurricane's Katrina, Rita, and Wilma.\n  By significantly lowering the cost of capital for small, medium, and \nlarge businesses alike, the provisions in this legislation will spur \nbusiness investment on the gulf coast, increase the supply of \naffordable housing, and put dislocated employees back to work.\n  Specifically, this legislation includes roughly $8 billion in tax \nincentives to help the gulf coast. These provisions: 50 percent bonus \ndepreciation for property acquired in the GO Zone; double small \nbusiness expensing for small businesses in the Zone; increase the \namount of tax-exempt bonds Mississippi is allowed to allocate by $4.8 \nbillion; allow for an additional advanced refunding for bonds \npreviously issued by Mississippi and by all local issuers within the GO \nZone; increase the amount low-income housing tax credits available to \nMississippi; increase the allocation of new markets tax credits \navailable for companies investing in Mississippi businesses and \nconstruction; allows for a 5-year net operation loss carryback for \nbusinesses in the zone; allows for a 10-year NOL for public utility \ndisaster losses; allows public utility disaster losses to be carried \nback 5 years; increases reforestation expensing from $10,000 to $20,000 \nfor expenses incurred in the Go Zone for 2006; allows small timber \ngrowers a 5 year NOL carryback for losses incurred in the zone; allows \nincreased expensing for demolition and clean up costs through 2007; and \nmakes the employees retention credit available to all employers in the \nzone.\n  We have been at this for several months now. My constituents have \nbeen patient, and deserve action now. This is a vitally important bill. \nIt is critical that we pass it today and that it is sent to the \nPresident for his signature before we adjourn.\n  This amendment modifies recent legislation introduced by Chairman \nGrassley by making clear that the business tax incentives in this \nlegislation do not apply to the construction of private or commercial \ngolf courses, country clubs, massage parlors, hot tub facilities or \nsuntan facilities, racetracks or other facilities used for gambling, or \nany store the principal business of which is the sale of alcoholic \nbeverages for consumption off premises.\n  However, it also makes clear that tax incentives do apply to the \nconstruction of hotels, restaurants, parking lots, and other \nattachments to gaming facilities.\n  I would have much preferred a clean bill, but in the interest of my \nconstituents, I am offering this amended legislation today. I ask \nunanimous consent that the amendment be adopted.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, the Senate has taken a big step forward \nin helping Louisiana and the other States affected by Hurricanes \nKatrina, Rita, and Wilma by passing H.R. 4440, the Gulf Opportunity \nZone Act of 2005, also known as the GO Zone Act. I realize that there \nare a number of very important pieces of legislation pending before the \nSenate and the House of Representatives as we wind down this session. \nBut I want my colleagues to know that I am grateful, and the people of \nLouisiana are grateful, for the Senate's passing this bill by unanimous \nconsent. I must thank Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Baucus of \nthe Finance Committee for their work on this legislation and for the \ntremendous support of their staffs.\n  The GO Zone Act contains a number of tax incentives to rebuild our \neconomic infrastructure. Our State will be able to issue bonds to build \nhousing, roads, bridges, and industrial plants. The bill increases the \nallocation of low-income housing tax credits in the GO Zone to $18 per \nperson--more than nine times the amount we are currently allocated--to \nbuild housing to allow all of our citizens to return home. Businesses \nwill be able to get favorable depreciation and enhanced deductions for \ninvesting in plant and equipment in the devastated areas. These tax \nincentives are aimed at helping our businesses stay in business. We \nalso included an expansion of the Hope scholarship and lifetime \nlearning credit for students who return to the GO Zone to continue \ntheir educations.\n  The bill also contains a housing provision that I offered as a floor \namendment when the Senate considered this legislation. The amendment, \ncosponsored by Senator Vitter, will create reward employers who have \nprovided housing for workers and their families in the hurricane \ndisaster area. These dedicated employers have made it possible for \ntheir workers to live on company property so that their business \noperations could get going again. They have rented or purchased \ntrailers and put them on their property, all hooked up to utilities. \nOur business leaders recognized that they could not get back on their \nfeet if their employees had no place to live near where they worked. \nFEMA has been incapable and incompetent in getting people into housing, \nso our businesses have stepped in to fill the void.\n  Under this provision, employees working at firms in the GO Zone may \nexclude up to $600 per month from income for employer-provided housing \nassistance. Employers get a tax credit of up to 30 percent of \nassistance provided to employees. The provision is temporary, lasting \nonly 6 months, but it was the right thing to do for companies that \nbelieve in Louisiana and the gulf as a great place to do business.\n  I must also note that the housing amendment had strong support from \nlocal and national business organizations, including the U.S. Chamber \nof Commerce, Greater New Orleans, Inc., and Michael Olivier, the \nLouisiana State Secretary for Economic Development. I ask unanimous \nconsent that their letters of support be printed in the Record.\n  These tax incentives, however, are still only a beginning. Tax cuts \nwill not build a levee, and without our levees, we will not rebuild New \nOrleans. I was pleased that the President recently announced his \nsupport for $3 billion in additional funding to restore our levees to \ntrue Category 3 protection, along with a down payment to get us to \nCategory 5 protection.\n  Now our focus must be on passing Chairman Thad Cochran's hurricane \nrelief package, which adds to the President's $17 billion request for \nFederal assistance another $17.5 billion in aid to Louisiana and \nMississippi, including funding for levee repairs. The chairman's \nleadership has built up support for the measure in the Senate, but we \nneed to urge the White House and leadership in House of Representatives \nto follow suit and commit to giving a hand up to the people of the gulf \ncoast. We should not go home for the holidays without taking this step \nfor the thousands still left without homes to go home to.\n  Mr. President, with the passage of the GO Zone Act, the Senate has \ntaken a key step toward helping the people of the gulf rebuild our \ncommunities. We must finish the job for this year in the gulf before we \nadjourn for the year.\n  I ask that my complete statement and the additional letters in \nsupport of the Landrieu amendment be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America,\n                                Washington, DC, December 14, 2005.\n     Hon.

Under your leadership, the Senate recently \n     passed a tax reconciliation plan, S. 2020 that included $7 \n     billion in additional incentives for investment to rebuild \n     the Gulf Coast. The House of Representatives has also passed \n     a hurricane relief package, similar to the provisions in the \n     S. 2020. Both the House and Senate Katrina packages will \n     greatly help the people in the Gulf rebuild homes, businesses \n     and communities.\n       During the Senate's consideration of S. 2020, it adopted an \n     amendment, sponsored by Senator Landrieu and cosponsored by \n     Senator Vitter, to provide tax relief to employers in the \n     Katrina affected areas who are providing housing for their \n     employees. Under the amendment, employees will be able to \n     exclude up to $600 per month in the value of any housing \n     assistance they receive from their employer. Employers will \n     be eligible for a tax credit of 30 percent of the housing \n     assistance they provide to their employees.\n       The lack of housing to bring back employees is one of the \n     largest detriments in bringing back the local economy and \n     serves as the base for establishing local commerce. The \n     Landrieu-Vitter amendment addresses one of the most pressing \n     needs in Louisiana, the need for housing while we rebuild our \n     economy. Our employers would like to open up for business \n     again, but their employees cannot return to work if they do \n     not have a place to live. We have worked with hundreds of \n     employers who have already taken steps to make housing \n     available to their employees through trailers and temporary \n     housing, but this amendment will encourage more employers to \n     do the same. With their employees close by, our businesses \n     can begin their operations helping to drive our economic \n     rebuilding. The Landrieu-Vitter amendment will help give this \n     growth a jumpstart.\n       We urge you to include the Landrieu-Vitter housing \n     amendment in the final version of any hurricane tax relief \n     bill before Congress adjourns for the year.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Mark C.

I ask unanimous consent the substitute amendment at the \ndesk be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be read the third time and \npassed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and any \nstatements related to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2680), in the nature of a substitute, was agreed \nto.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  The bill (H.R. 4440), as amended, was read a third time and passed.\n  Mr. LOTT. Briefly, I express appreciation to Senator Grassley, \nSenator Baucus, especially Senator Reid for his efforts, my colleague \nfrom Mississippi, Senator Cochran, the input and the help and the \ndetermination of Senator Landrieu from Louisiana, and Senator Vitter, \nSenator Hutchison and Senator Cornyn. I will have my additional \nremarks. I thank all those involved. This is important legislation. \nThis is almost $8 billion in tax incentives and relief for the people \nin the hurricane areas. It means so much. Now we will be able to pass \nthis back to the House, and hopefully they will take it up and send it \ndirectly to the President.\n  Mr. REID. This is not the time for a long statement. I especially \nextend my appreciation to the chairman and the ranking member of the \nCommittee on Finance--it has been tough sledding--and, of course, the \ndelegation from\n\n[[Page S13708]]\n\nMississippi, that of the Senator from Louisiana.\n  I ask unanimous consent the Senator from Louisiana be recognized for \n90 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, it will only take 90 seconds to thank \nSenator Lott for his leadership and the two managers, Senator Grassley \nand Senator Baucus, who have literally worked tirelessly on this piece \nof legislation to help the people along the gulf coast. This is part of \na relief package that will help us to help ourselves, get our people \nback home, our businesses back to work, and the gulf coast on its feet, \nso we can continue to support the needs of this Nation through energy \nand commerce and trade.\n  I thank Senator Lott particularly for the extra effort he has put \ninto this bill. I thank the leadership for passing it this morning.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/16/senate-section/article/S13708-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13708-S13735]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   USA PATRIOT AND TERRORISM PREVENTION REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2005--\n                      CONFERENCE REPORT--Continued\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield up to 3 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nIdaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized for 3 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank the ranking member of the Judiciary \nCommittee for yielding. Let me also thank the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee. I thought he gave a thoughtful overview of the progression \nof time and thought that has gone into the conference report that is \nbefore the Senate at this moment.\n  Of all that we do this year that is lasting beyond tomorrow, clearly \nthe PATRIOT Act is one of those pieces of legislation. I say that \nbecause it deals with fundamental constitutional rights in this \ncountry. At the same time, it deals with our right to protect ourselves \nagainst foreign interests that might intrude upon our shores.\n  The chairman has said so well, it is a very precarious balancing act \nbetween the right of the free citizen and a civil society that is \nprotected by law. That is what we as Senators are about at this moment. \nThat is what I have always been about, along with my colleagues. That \nis why some of us joined well over a year and a half ago to say that \nwhen it came time to reauthorize the PATRIOT Act, here were some \nprovisions that stepped us back toward the right of free citizens to be \nprotected by their Government, in fact, against their Government's law \nenforcement capability; while at the same time not hand-tying the \nability of law enforcement and intelligence to come together to review, \nto investigate, and to determine whether someone's acts were terrorist \nin nature and might put free citizens of our country in jeopardy.\n\n  I cannot, nor will I, vote for cloture today because I am here to \ndefend what the Senate has already done so well in such a bipartisan \nand in such a thoughtful way. We will not adjourn this session of this \nCongress without a PATRIOT Act in place, whether it is the 3-month \nextension we offered or whether it is the chairman, as he said, and the \nranking member sitting down with the House to once again shape, in \nlimited ways, those areas we think are critically necessary to make \nsure the balance the chairman so clearly spoke to is adhered to within \na reauthorized PATRIOT Act.\n  So I would urge my colleagues' calmness and sensitivity to the \nfundamental civil liberties of our country, as we worked so hard to \nbalance them against our country's and our Constitution's and our \nGovernment's primary responsibility; and that is to keep us safe and \nsecure in a free environment.\n  I thank the ranking member for yielding, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we have only had 2\\1/2\\ hours of debate on \nthis major matter. We have very little time. I yield up to 3 minutes to \nthe distinguished senior Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized \nfor 3 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, America deserves laws that protect both \ntheir security and their civil liberties. This conference report does \nnot. After years of doubt about the PATRIOT Act, this morning Americans \nwoke up to more startling reports. For the past 3 years, the \nadministration has been eavesdropping on hundreds of calls without \nwarrants or oversights. These are the newspapers: ``Bush Authorized \nDomestic Spying.'' ``Bush Lets U.S. Spy on Callers Without Courts.''\n  Well, the administration is not responding to the article, but they \ntell us: Trust us. We follow the law. Give me a break. Across the \ncountry and across the political spectrum, no one is buying it anymore.\n  This administration feels it is above the law, and the American \npeople and our Constitution pay the price. There is no accountability. \nThere is no oversight. The President continues to ignore history.\n  In the 1970s, Big Brother spied on its citizens, and the American \npeople stood up and said ``no.'' President Nixon's program, the \nCOINTELPRO, allowed broad spying on law-abiding American citizens. We \nstopped Big Brother then by establishing the FISA court to ensure \nproper oversight and protections. Now this administration believes it \nis above even those protections. This is Big Brother run amok. With \nthese new developments, we must take a step back and not rush the \nPATRIOT Act, further risking our civil protections.\n  The entire world is watching to see how we strike the balance between \nintelligence gathering and the Constitution. We cannot protect our \nborders if we do not protect our ideals. We need a bipartisan consensus \nthat protects both our security and our liberty while restoring the \npublic trust.\n  Our country is at a new low. Not since Watergate has there been such \na lack of openness and honesty in our Government. Americans deserve \nbetter. The leaking of a CIA agent's identity is the prime example. The \nPresident promised he would clean house of anyone in the White House \nwho had anything to do with the leak in the Plame case or the coverup. \nIt has been suggested that the President himself may know the identity \nof the source, and I urge him to set the record straight.\n  The President needs to answer three questions: One, what did he know \nand when did he know it? Two, did he tell the special prosecutor, \nFitzgerald, the whole story? And, three, who else knows the facts? \nCheney? Gonzales? Ashcroft? If Novak knew and the President knew, then \nthe American people should know, too.\n  Mr. President, answer these questions.\n  In the last few days, we have heard a lot about whether America will \nbe safer if the Senate approves the PATRIOT Act conference report this \nweek.\n  Let's set the record straight--our national security will not be 3 \njeopardized--at all--if existing laws stay in place for 3 more months. \nThese surveillance methods will expire only if the Republican \nleadership refuses to negotiate--even with Members of their own party.\n  We have unfinished business on the table. The conference report fails \nto do all we can to improve intelligence-gathering capabilities and \nlegislative oversight.\n  Americans deserve a law that protects both their security and their \nliberties, and this bill does not.\n  We need to preserve the basic powers created by the PATRIOT Act, but \nwe also need to improve the safeguards that are indispensable to our \ndemocracy. Civil liberty protections are a continuing source of our \ncountry's strength--not just fringe benefits to be abandoned in time of \ncrisis.\n  We all agree on the need for law enforcement and intelligence \nofficers to have strong powers to investigate terrorism, to prevent \nfuture attacks, and improve information-sharing between Federal, State \nand local law enforcement.\n  In the wake of the tragic events on September 11, Congress, the \nadministration, and the country faced the urgent need to do everything \npossible to strengthen our national security and counterterrorism \nefforts, and the original PATRIOT Act was our response to that need.\n  Even at that time, many of us had concerns about whether the law went\n\n[[Page S13709]]\n\ntoo far. In November 2001, Nancy Talanian and a small group of \nneighbors in western Massachusetts came together to launch the Bill of \nRights Defense Committee--what has now become a nationwide movement to \nprotect the Bill of Rights.\n  This small Massachusetts group encouraged similar community \ndiscussions across the country. Seven States and hundreds of local \ngovernments engaged in vigorous public debate on the scope of the \nPATRIOT Act. As of this week, 400 resolutions have been passed.\n  These efforts can't be casually dismissed because the administration \nclaims there have not been any ``verified abuses'' of the PATRIOT Act.\n  The Republican leadership tells us that time has run out and this \nlegislation must be passed without further debate. We are told that \nenough oversight has taken place.\n  But it took 2 years--2 years--for the Department of Justice to \nrespond to questions from the Senate Judiciary Committee about the use \nof the PATRIOT Act tools. We didn't receive the significant written \nanswers until after the committee approved its bill.\n  We then learned that the Federal Government has only reported three \ninstances in which a U.S. person was informed of a search because there \nwas no national security interest in keeping it secret. Only three \ntimes has the Attorney General notified a United States person that \nthey have been searched.\n  Yet we read more newspaper stories about FBI mistakes. The FBI says \nit averages about 10 mistakes a year. As a result of litigation, the \nFBI has admitted publicly that unauthorized electronic surveillance has \ngone on for months before mistakes were caught.\n  Now, I don't doubt that the FBI is trying to do a good job--but how \nmany mistakes does it take to count as an abuse?\n  This administration tells us to disregard such mistakes because the \ninformation is being collected only about individuals linked to \nterrorism. Clearly, that is not the case.\n  I know personally about mistakes in the war on terror. Not long ago. \nI was on the no-fly list, and had to make a number of calls to clear up \nthe resulting confusion.\n  Countless others have had a similar experience. I received a letter \nfrom a man in California. He had gone to the airport with his family to \nbegin a vacation to Disneyland. Arriving at the airport, they \nencountered an unexpected surprise. His nephew, Liam Collins--at that \ntime just 7 years old--was on the government's no-fly list. Seven years \nold and on the no-fly list.\n  Liam and his family convinced airport officials it was a ``mistake.'' \nLiam made it to Disneyland but he sent me a picture about his \nexperience--which had become a memorable part of the trip.\n  Since then, Liam hasn't traveled by plane, so no one knows whether \nthe ``mistake'' has been fixed.\n  What about other mistakes? The Justice Department tells us that the \nso-called libraries provision has never even been used to search a \nlibrary.\n  That may be just a clever way of saying that it is happening in a \ndifferent way. In 2002, Attorney General Ashcroft told Congress that \n``national security letters'' would be the better tool for library \nsearches anyway.\n  Maybe Ashcroft was right. The so-called libraries provision has only \nbeen used 35 times--but over 30,000 national security letters have been \nissued, according to the Washington Post. The public doesn't know if \nthat number is accurate, because the administration refuses to confirm \nit.\n  The conference report will require public reporting on the use. It \nwill also require the Inspector General to audit their use.\n  But under these authorities, the Government is not required to obtain \na court order. Your local library has no clear right to challenge \ndemands for computer records in court. For consumers, there is zero \nprotection--much less notice--if your records are taken by mistake. The \nrecipient of a national security letter is barred forever from talking \nabout it--even if the need for secrecy no longer exists.\n  On these national security letters, the conference report has two \nmajor shortcomings. One of the most glaring omissions is the failure to \ninclude a sunset provision for national security letters, which would \nbe consistent and logical given the new reporting and auditing \nprovisions contained in the conference report. Without doubt, it is \nmore meaningful to have a sunset on a provision used 30,000 times than \none that is used 35 times.\n  What we anticipated 4 years ago is abundantly clear now: 4-year \nsunsets are the only means to ensure adequate congressional oversight \nof controversial law enforcement and counterterrorism activities.\n  In addition, recipients of these orders should have a meaningful \nright to judicial review. The administration's acquiescence in giving \nrecipients the right to consult an attorney is not a meaningful \nconcession. The Justice Department has already taken that position in \nlitigation. The conference report does not advance civil liberties on \nthat point. In fact, it makes it harder to win in court. Under the \nconference report, banks, phone companies, and libraries challenging \nthese authorities will have to overcome an even higher threshold in \ncourt, and companies may have to turn over records even where there is \nnot even an individualized suspicion of terrorism.\n  The Federal Government should focus on whether the country is doing \nenough to protect citizens from another terrorist attack, and is \nproviding adequate safeguards to protect fundamental civil liberties.\n  What Americans want and deserve is responsible legislation. Our \nSenate bill included the necessary assistance for law enforcement, \nwhile maintaining fundamental protections in accord with the Bill of \nRights. As a result, it received unanimous approval of the entire \nSenate.\n  At the first and only meeting of this conference, I urged my \ncolleagues to support the Senate bill, keeping in mind the \nrecommendations of the bipartisan 9/11 Commission, which made clear \nthat the executive branch has the burden of proof to justify why a \nparticular governmental power should be retained--and Congress has the \nresponsibility to see that adequate guidelines and oversight are made \navailable.\n  On the two most contentious surveillance methods, the executive \nbranch has failed to meet the 9/11 Commissioners' burden of proof--much \nless the burden of persuasion. The American people are not convinced \nthat these methods achieve the right balance between our national \nsecurity and protection of our civil liberties.\n  This conference report, however, failed to meet the 9/11 \nCommissioners' recommendations. It is especially alarming that the \nCommissioners' report card gave five failing grades in key areas of \nneed. Obviously, America is not as safe as it should be.\n  Snooping on library computers is no substitute for strong and \neffective steps to prevent terrorist attacks.\n  With this conference report, some harsh provisions were deleted, but \nother abusive provisions were added. Debate about extraneous provisions \ntook priority over improvements in the core provisions. It appears that \nthe PATRIOT Act can't get better without also getting worse.\n  The administration wants to get this bill done--but the American \npeople want it done right.\n  I urge my colleagues to join in supporting our bipartisan bill to \nextend the deadline for the expiring provisions for another 90 days. \nWith a March 31 deadline, we can deal responsibly with the major issues \nstill on the table. Serious concerns about the standards and oversight \nof the most contentious surveillance methods can and must be addressed.\n  Our Senate bill contained fundamental protections in accord with the \nBill of Rights. It passed with our unanimous support, and it is \ndisappointing that this conference report fails to do the same.\n  We need an effective strategy to win the war on terror, a strategy \nthat strengthens terrorism laws that work, corrects laws and policies \nthat don't, and protects the rights and privacy of all law-abiding \nAmericans.\n  The entire country is watching to see how we strike the balance \nbetween national security and the Constitution. We are very close to \nagreement on this bill. Let's take the necessary time to reach a \nbipartisan consensus that protects both our security and our liberty, \nand restores the public trust in Congress as an institution.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I come to the Chamber today to speak about\n\n[[Page S13710]]\n\nthe PATRIOT Act reauthorization conference report. While this agreement \ndoes not give everyone all that they want, it is the result of lengthy, \ndifficult negotiations. It represents a reasonable compromise for all \nparties involved, and it extends tools important to our national \nsecurity, while enhancing civil liberties protections.\n  It has been more than 4 years since the terrorist attacks of \nSeptember 11, 2001. In the days, weeks, and months since that day, the \nAmerican people have braced themselves for the possibility of another \nterrorist attack on our homeland.\n  After all, we know all too well that al-Qaida is a stealthy, \nsophisticated, and patient enemy, and its leadership is motivated to \nlaunch another devastating attack on American citizens and soil.\n  Outside the United States, al-Qaida and its affiliates have continued \nto be remarkably active, responsible for numerous attacks, spanning the \nglobe from Pakistan to Bali, Spain to London.\n  It is precisely because al-Qaida is so aggressive, so motivated, and \nso demonstrably hostile to America that I am grateful that, to date, \nthey still have not successfully launched another attack on our soil. \nThere are undoubtedly many reasons for this. First and foremost: the \nbrave men and women of our Armed Forces. They are fighting the \nterrorist abroad so that we do not have to face them at home. Also, our \nefforts to strengthen antiterrorism and law enforcement tools through \nthe USA PATRIOT Act has had much to do with this record of success and \npeace to date.\n  This diligence that has kept us safe at home must continue. The war \non terrorism must be fought aggressively--but consistent with the \nprotection of civil rights and civil liberties. That is why I am \ndisappointed when we witness false reports and scare tactics about \nphantom civil rights violations. Such reports and tactics serve no \nlegitimate cause--but they do a grave disservice to the American \npeople. Whenever real civil liberties problems do arise, we must learn \nabout them right away, so that we can fix them swiftly. Congress works \nhard to strike both a careful and wise balance between national \nsecurity and civil liberties. While this is not always easy, we do so \nwith the best interests of our Nation in mind--and we do so in a manner \nthat is both honest and in good faith. This conference report strikes a \ncareful balance by both preserving the provisions that have made \nAmerica safer since 9/11 and increasing congressional and judicial \noversight--which should alleviate the concerns of those who believe the \nlaw enforcement tools endanger civil liberties.\n  Many who oppose this agreement do so because of concerns that law \nenforcement will abuse these tools. While a legitimate concern, it \nsimply has not been borne out by facts. First, the reports issued by \nthe Department of Justice's independent inspector general have \nrepeatedly found no systematic abuses of any of the provisions of \nPatriot. Second, these provisions are carried out by professional and \ndedicated law enforcement officers in a way that respects the rights of \nall Americans.\n  It has been said that time is a great healer. And, as time goes by, \nthe shock we all felt following the 9/11 attacks has abated, somewhat. \nBut as we recall those terrible memories, we are reminded of the \ninstitutional failures of our Government that failed to prevent the \nattacks. And we as a Nation, and the Congress in particular, vowed to \ntear down the walls that prevented information sharing, and to enact \nother tools vital to defending this country. It is clear that the \nPATRIOT Act has played a significant role in this process, as it has \nbeen instrumental in dismantling terrorist cells from New York to \nOregon.\n  The failure to pass this conference report will cause these critical \ntools to lapse. It will weaken our country by reverting to September \n10th-era tools. We cannot allow that to happen. We are living in \nprofoundly different times. There are obviously deep feelings about the \nPATRIOT Act from all quarters. I and others support the PATRIOT Act and \nhave been vocal about making these provisions permanent. Because not \neveryone agrees with this view, negotiations and compromises took place \nto reach an agreement that achieves the dual goals of continuing these \ncritical authorities and enhancing congressional and judicial \noversight.\n  Some have proposed that we pass a 3-month extension to continue \nworking on the reauthorization. I oppose that. The Congress placed a \nDecember 31, 2005, deadline for a reason. The President, the Attorney \nGeneral and the House support this agreement. We should vote on this \nagreement, and I intend to vote for cloture and will support the \nconference report.\n  However, if we are searching for alternatives, I propose the Senate \ntake up and immediately pass legislation that I cosponsored last \nCongress which would strike all of the sunsets contained in the PATRIOT \nAct. This would eliminate the deadline we face, those in the House and \nthose in the Senate can offer what they consider improving legislation \nand work to move it through the regular legislative process. That way, \nnone of the vital authorities will be allowed to lapse and any changes \nthat majority of the Congress supports will be implemented through the \nregular order.\n  Beyond this proposal, I want to discuss some of the specific items \naddressed by the conference report and try to explain why I think this \nreport should be supported, beginning with sunsets.\n  I have stated that I oppose sunsets for this important legislation. I \nbelieve that our intelligence and law enforcement officials should \nnever again be left wondering whether the Congress will manage to agree \nto reauthorize the tools that protect our Nation.\n  But realizing that there are those who feel that these sunsets are \nimportant to the negotiations, I choose to support the sunsets, even \nthough if we were going to have sunsets I would have preferred the 10-\nyear sunsets included in the House-passed version. This conference \nreport retains 4-year sunsets for two of the most controversial PATRIOT \nAct provisions, the multipoint or ``roving'' wiretaps and the business \nrecords provision.\n  It also includes a sunset for the ``Lone Wolf' provision added to the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act by last year's Intelligence \nReform Act. This guarantees the Congress will review these provisions \nand continue to conduct rigorous oversight.\n  Senator Specter and others on the conference attempted to address \ncivil liberty concerns in many ways, for example, dealing with the \ndelayed search warrant provision. As my colleagues know, this section \nis not to sunset. Nevertheless, recognizing the sensitivity to this \nprovision certain Members had, the conference report requires the \nGovernment to now give notice of any search under this provision within \n30 days of its execution, unless the facts justify a later date \ncertain.\n  Although the 30-day period is a few weeks longer than the 7-day time \nlimit contained in the original Senate bill, it is considerably shorter \nthan the 180 days permitted under the House bill. The conference report \nallows for extensions but only ``upon an updated showing of the need \nfor further delay.'' Also, it limits any extensions to 90 days or less, \nunless the facts of the case justify a longer delay.\n  It also adds new public reporting on the use of delayed notice \nwarrants, so that Congress and the American people will be better \ninformed about the use of this provision.\n  My time is short today, but I want to briefly mention other civil \nliberties protections Chairman Specter negotiated. The report made \nexplicit the ability of recipients of NSL letters and 215 orders to \nseek judicial review. Significantly, on both of these authorities, the \nconference report requires the inspector general to conduct two audits \nof these authorities, one audit covering 2002 through 2004; another \ncovering 2005-2006. And, in recognition of concerns about NSLs, the \nconference report adds a new ``sunshine'' provision. Namely, it \nrequires annual public reporting on NSLs, including the aggregate \n``number of requests made by the Department of Justice.''\n  Additionally, this report gives the Senate Judiciary Committees \naccess to significant FISA reporting currently provided to the \nIntelligence Committee. It also includes a provision cosponsored by \nSenators Specter and Leahy requiring that rules and procedures of the \nFISA court be supplied to\n\n[[Page S13711]]\n\nCongress. It further creates new reporting requirements to Congress for \nthe use of emergency authorities under FISA and requires new reporting \non the use of emergency disclosures of communications information made \nunder Section 212 of the PATRIOT Act. And finally, it retains a \nmodified version of the data-mining report contained in the House-\npassed bill which will require the Department of Justice to submit a \nreport to Congress on the Department's data-mining activities.\n\n  I also want to mention another provision contained in the conference \nreport because it is based on legislation that I introduced in the \nSenate. The Narco-Terrorism Prevention Act confronts the new reality \nand very real danger of the deadly mix of drug trafficking and \nterrorism.\n  Terrorists, like the old organized crime syndicates from the past, \nhave recognized that illegal drug trafficking is a valuable source of \nfinancing and another way to threaten our country.\n  My State is experiencing the collateral effects of a drug war being \ncarried out by modern day narco-terrorists in Nuevo Laredo, Mexico. \nNews reports have described an ongoing battle between rival drug \ncartels over drug smuggling routes from Mexico into the United States. \nThese organizations assassinate police officers and other government \nofficials in a clear attempt to force the local government to allow \nthese organizations to carry on their illegal activity, unimpeded. Our \ngovernment needs every available tool at its disposal to combat this \nactivity.\n  This new provision makes it a Federal crime designed to punish the \ntrafficking of controlled substances which are intended to benefit a \nforeign terrorist organization or any one else planning a terrorist \nattack. It also carries stiff penalties for anyone convicted. \nImportantly, it provides for extraterritorial jurisdiction which allows \nlaw enforcement to reach beyond our borders to arrest and deter those \nwho intend to carry out a crime of this nature.\n  Mr. President, I have opposed changing the core provisions of the \nPATRIOT Act and have opposed any increase in the burdens for terrorism \nor national security investigations or on terrorism or national \nsecurity investigators because they should have the same tools \navailable to them as do ordinary criminal investigators.\n  We must remain vigilant, and we must make sure that evidentiary \nhurdles do not creep back into the law in terrorism and national \nsecurity investigations. We should avoid moving back to a pre-9/11 \nmindset. I believe that the package before us today continues the \nreforms we have made in the post-9/11 period, and I intend to vote in \nfavor of this package.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, since the beginning of our country's \nhistory, Americans have recognized the vital importance of balancing \nthe safety and security of our people with the need to uphold civil \nliberties in our society. There have been times when the Congress has \nsucceeded in achieving this fine balance, and there have been times \nwhen the Congress has failed to do so.\n  In 2001, I supported the passage of the PATRIOT Act because I \nbelieved the legislation that emerged from the conference between the \nHouse and the Senate had achieved this goal. However, this legislation \nhas since been used for purposes beyond what we had envisioned 4 years \nago, and that troubles me. As a result, I have cosponsored the Security \nand Freedom Enhancement, SAFE, Act, which would modify the law.\n  I was pleased to support the legislation to reauthorize the PATRIOT \nAct as it unanimously passed the Senate earlier this year. This version \nreflected many of the important changes contained in the SAFE Act. It \nwould have restored the balance between security and civil liberties, \nwhile the House version would further tilt the balance away from civil \nliberties. I was hopeful the final conference report on this \nlegislation would reflect the Senate version, but unfortunately, this \nis not the case.\n  This conference report falls short in restoring the balance between \nsecurity and civil liberties, and therefore I cannot in good conscience \nsupport its passage. The conference report falls short because the \nlegislation contains no sunset for controversial provisions like \n``sneak and peek'' warrants; the legislation's standard for being able \nto obtain records is only mere relevance, rather than requiring an \nactual connection with a spy or terrorist; the legislation makes it \nnearly impossible to obtain a meaningful judicial review of production \norders and the gag orders that accompany them; and the legislation \nallows for a disturbing lack of notice to individuals whose records are \nobtained under the law.\n  In short, this legislation fails to restore the critical balance \nbetween security and civil liberties, a balance that I believe all \nAmericans consider a vital part of our democracy.\n  Therefore, I will oppose limiting debate on the conference report and \nfinal passage of the conference report in its current form. Given that \nthe end of the session is fast approaching, we should pass a short-term \nextension of the expiring PATRIOT Act provisions, as advanced by \nSenators Leahy, Sununu and others, to allow this conference report to \nbe improved and ultimately strike the proper balance.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I raise my strong concerns about news \nreports regarding the administration's blatant disregard for American's \nprivacy rights and civil liberties. I am shocked by the recent \nrevelation that President Bush secretly authorized the National \nSecurity Agency to eavesdrop on Americans and others inside the United \nStates to search for evidence of terrorist activity without court-\napproved warrants. I am equally appalled by the Pentagon's dismal \nenforcement of guidelines that reuire deleting information on American \ncitizens from a counterterrorism database within 3 months if they pose \nno security threats.\n  Government agencies are not following important rules and procedures \ndesigned to protect the American people. Just this summer, the \nnonpartisan Government Accountability Office issued a report at my \nrequest which found that agencies are not following privacy laws \ndesigned to protect personal information in Federal data mining \nsystems. Considering that there are nearly 200 data mining systems in \nthe Federal Government, these actions pose real threats to Americans' \nprivacy.\n  Merely having policies and safeguards in place does nothing if \nagencies are not following the law. As such, I cannot vote to renew \nsome of the most troublesome PATRIOT Act provisions that threaten civil \nliberties, including the Government's far-reaching powers to obtain \npersonal, medical, library, and business records or coduct ``sneak-and-\npeek'' searches, without ensuring that meaningful checks and balances \nare in place.\n  I want to assure the people of Hawaii and all Americans that I am \nworking on legislation to strengthen Federal privacy laws.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in opposition to \nclosing off debate on the PATRIOT Act conference report as it has come \nback to the Senate.\n  The events of September 11 demonstrated various deficiencies in our \nunderstanding of the terrorist threat and our capabilities in terms of \ncombating terrorism. In response, Congress acted decisively and passed \nthe PATRIOT Act to ensure that our Government has all the tools \nnecessary to protect the American people. I supported that legislation.\n  The PATRIOT Act, as originally enacted, was 342 pages long and \ncontained 10 titles and 116 sections. The bill improved our laws with \nregard to international money laundering, terrorism financing, \nintelligence gathering, surveillance, cooperation between law \nenforcement and intelligence authorities, and strengthened our criminal \nlaws relating to terrorism. The vast majority of these provisions are \nnot expiring. They remain the law of the land. Indeed, only 16 of the \nmost controversial sections in the bill contained sunset provisions.\n  Congress recognized that we were extending to law enforcement and \nintelligence authorities expansive new surveillance powers and that it \nwas important to go back and look at how these powers have been used \nand whether we needed to make any changes in the law to ensure that \nAmericans' civil liberties are protected. While I support the \nreauthorization of these expiring provisions, I believe that there are\n\n[[Page S13712]]\n\nchanges that need to be made to address some of the problematic \nprovisions.\n  Let me be clear. I support giving law enforcement the tools necessary \nto aggressively fight terrorism but believe that modest modifications \nare required to ensure that we protect constitutional rights and \nproperly balance civil liberties with national security concerns. To \nthis end, in July the Senate unanimously passed a bipartisan bill that \nwould reauthorize the PATRIOT Act with important safeguards in place to \nprotect the rights of Americans. Although this bill wasn't perfect, it \nstruck a reasonable balance between giving law enforcement the tools \nthey need and protecting civil liberties.\n  When the PATRIOT Act was originally passed in 2001, Congress provided \nthat some of the controversial provisions, such as section 215 which \nallows the Government access to library and medical records, would \nexpire in 2006.\n  One example of where the current version of the bill falls short is \nwith regard to section 215, the so-called library provision which \nallows the Government to obtain sensitive personal records, including \nlibrary, business, and medical records, of Americans by merely saying \nthat they are relevant to a terrorism investigation. This provides the \nGovernment almost unfettered authority to look at the personal records \nof Americans. Under the Senate-passed bill, the Government would have \nto demonstrate that the person whose records they are seeking has some \nconnection to a suspected terrorist or spy.\n  In particular, the Government would have to show that, No. 1, the \nrecords pertain to a suspected terrorist or a spy; or No. 2, that the \nrecords pertain to an individual in contact with a suspected terrorist \nor a spy; or No. 3, that the records are relevant to the activities of \na suspected terrorist or spy. It is reasonable to require that if the \nGovernment is going to look at the private records of Americans without \na traditional warrant that the Government show at a minimum that the \nrequest for records has some connection to a terrorist and isn't just \npart of a fishing expedition.\n  In addition, when a person receives a section 215 order requesting \nmedical records or library records, the person who receives this \nrequest is subject to an automatic and permanent gag order that \nprevents them from speaking about the order or challenging the gag \norder in court. Similar restrictions on challenging gag orders have \nbeen found to be unconstitutional and a violation of the first \namendment.\n  Another section of the bill that is of great concern relates to \nnational security letters, or NSLs. These requests for documents are \nsimilar to section 215 orders except that they do not require any court \napproval at all. Although a section 215 order needs to be approved by \nthe Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, a NSL is simply issued by \nthe FBI, without any judicial review, to a business to obtain certain \nrecords, such as financial records, that it believes are relevant to a \nterrorism or intelligence investigation.\n  The conference report does allow a NSL recipient to challenge the NSL \nin court, but it also stipulates that regardless of whether there are \nnational security concerns, all of the Government's submissions are \nsecret and cannot be shared with the person challenging the order. And \nto be clear, the business being denied knowledge of the ``governmental \nsubmissions'' is not the target of the investigation but the recipient \nof the order for the requested documents.\n  Also the recipient of the NSL is subject to an automatic gag order. \nAlthough the gag order can be challenged in court, the only way to \nprevail is to demonstrate that the Government is acting in bad faith, a \nburden that is almost impossible to prove.\n  I also have concerns about other aspects of the conference report, \nsuch as the ``sneak and peek'' provision which allows law enforcement \nto search homes without notifying individuals of the search for an \nextended period of time.\n  This bill has profound implications on the constitutional rights of \nAmericans, and I strongly believe that we shouldn't be hastily \napproving a bill that falls short of adequately protecting civil \nliberties.\n  Simply reauthorizing the most controversial provisions and saying \nthat we will take another look at the bill in 4 years when the new \nsunset provisions expire is not the appropriate way to deal with this \nissue. It has been 4 years since the bill was enacted and it is time \nthat Congress addresses the substantive problems with the act.\n  The Senate has demonstrated that it is prepared to reauthorize all of \nthe expiring provisions, and there is no need to pass this version of \nthe bill in its flawed form. I agree with Senator Leahy that we should \ntemporarily extend the PATRIOT Act for 3 months to give Congress more \ntime to work out the remaining issues in a thoughtful way. It is my \nhope that a solution can be reached that reflects the commonsense \nimprovements that were included in the Senate-passed version of the \nbill.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the Combat \nMeth Act. I am proud to be a cosponsor of the Combat Meth Act because \nit addresses a problem that impacts every aspect of our society. I was \nexcited when the Combat Meth Act was included as part of the Commerce, \nJustice, State Appropriation bill this year, and I was extremely \ndisappointed that it wasn't included in the final conference report. \nThough Senator Leahy requested that the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic \nAct be presented to the Senate as a freestanding bill, it is \nunfortunately included at the end of the PATRIOT Act.\n  So much has been said on the PATRIOT Act's civil liberty provisions, \nyet little has been said about the very important section of the \nconference report, the Combat Meth Act.\n  The methamphetamine problem in this country needs attention. \nMethamphetamine abuse has increased dramatically in recent years, \nreaching all comers of the United States. It is a very large problem in \nthe State of Montana.\n  That is why I was pleased when the Senate gave methamphetamine the \nattention it deserved. And we worked together to produce a bipartisan \nbill.\n  The Senate Combat Meth Act provided greater regulations for \nmethamphetamine, just what law enforcement officers asked us for. The \nSenate bill focused on regulation, monitoring, treatment, and \nprevention.\n  The conference report does not provide the same provisions we \nnegotiated in the Senate for the Combat Meth Act. Though I support the \nideas behind many sections of the conference report, including the \nrestrictions on the allowable quantity purchasable, the requirement for \nover-the-counter medicines containing pseudoephedrine to be sold by a \nlicensed pharmacist, and the establishment of a log book for these \nproducts, I still do not believe we have done enough to solve the \nmethamphetamine problem.\n  In addition, the conference report changed the drug kingpin statute \nand lowered the eligibility thresholds for death sentences and \nmandatory life sentences. This is not what we need most. We need to \nwork more on prevention.\n  Though I voted to oppose cloture on the PATRIOT Act, I support the \nCombat Meth Act and the need for legislation on this important issue. \nWe must help solve the methamphetamine problem. Law enforcement \nofficers depend on us. Methamphetamine addicts depend on us. And \nchildren of methamphetamine users depend on us to work together to \nbring this piece of legislation to the floor again.\n  I will work with my colleagues to make sure methamphetamine is a high \npriority issue when we come back after the New Year.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, in the wake of the September 11 \nterrorist attacks, this body came together--Republicans and Democrats \nalike--around the shared goal of preventing a similar tragedy from ever \noccurring again on our soil. Toward this end, Congress worked in a \nbipartisan manner to pass the provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act, \nlegislation that expanded many of our laws, providing our Government \nand law enforcement with the tools needed to ably combat these threats. \nWe understood then, as we do now, that these tools are important in our \nfight against terrorism. And because there is no greater responsibility \nthat we bear as Members of this body than ensuring the safety of our \ncitizens, I voted in favor of the USA PATRIOT Act in 2001 and supported \nits reauthorization when the Senate considered its bill earlier this \nyear.\n\n[[Page S13713]]\n\n  But even in the immediate aftermath of the September 11 tragedy, \nCongress recognized that in its haste to give law enforcement these \nexpanded powers, there was a risk that this new authority was coming at \nthe expense of constitutionally guaranteed rights and liberties. And so \nin the wisdom of both Republican and Democratic legislators, several \nprovisions of the PATRIOT Act included 4-year sunsets, allowing \nCongress the opportunity to revisit whether the PATRIOT Act strikes the \nproper balance between securing our safety and ensuring our freedom.\n  I have very serious concerns that the current PATRIOT Act \nreauthorization conference report, which was negotiated largely without \nthe input of Democrats, does not do enough to strike this proper \nbalance. I believe that we can be both safe and free. The conference \nreport falls well short of achieving that goal. I am hopeful that \nbipartisan negotiations can result in a compromise bill like the one \nagreed to in the Senate in July, a bill which did a far better job of \nprotecting our civil liberties.\n  The current conference report fails in many respects.\n  Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act gives law enforcement in domestic \nintelligence investigations nearly limitless power to obtain all types \nof personal records, including business, library, and medical records. \nUnder current law, the Government merely needs to demonstrate that the \nrecords it seeks are ``sought for'' a terrorism investigation. Upon \nsuch a showing, a secret court is required to issue the order. This is \nan extremely lenient standard, one that for the first time gives the \nGovernment almost unchecked access to the sensitive personal \ninformation of innocent Americans. To compound matters, the third \nparties--business, libraries, hospitals, and the like--who are \nrecipients of these orders are subject to an automatic gag order. They \ncannot tell anyone that they have been asked for these records, \nincluding the person whose documents the Government is seeking.\n  Given its broad scope, this provision has tremendous potential for \nabuse. Innocent Americans should not be subjected to these possible \nintrusions when adequate safeguards can be written into the law, ones \nthat would not sacrifice the utility of these orders as a law \nenforcement tool. Americans should not have to hope that the Government \nwill demonstrate self-restraint in its exercise of this power, nor \nshould they fear that their personal records will be part of a \nGovernment fishing expedition.\n  The Senate bill, which I supported, not only required the Government \nto meet a higher standard before issuing these orders, it also gave \nrecipients of a FISA order an explicit and meaningful right to \nchallenge these orders and their accompanying gag orders in court. The \nconference report sadly retains a variation of the current law's \nexceptionally lenient standard of review, a standard that effectively \nturns the courts into little more than a rubberstamp. Further, the \nconference report does not give the recipient of a FISA order any \nexpress right at all to seek meaningful judicial review of its gag \norder. Quite simply, the conference report places inadequate checks on \nthese orders.\n  Another failure of the conference report was exposed in an article \nappearing in the Sunday, November 6, 2005 edition of The Washington \nPost, which brought to light a very troubling practice by the FBI that \nunderscores the importance of adopting proper safeguards.\n  National security letters, NSLs, are administrative subpoenas that \nallow the FBI to obtain sensitive information about ordinary Americans \nin national security cases. NSLs are issued by FBI agents without the \nauthorization or approval of a judge, grand jury or prosecutor. While \nthe FBI has long employed NSLs, the PATRIOT Act greatly expanded their \nscope, significantly lowering the standard for their issuance. The \nresult has been, according to The Washington Post, a ``hundredfold \nincrease'' in their use, with the FBI annually issuing thousands of \nNSLs demanding private information about ordinary Americans not \nnecessarily suspected of any crime. These records include financial, \nlibrary, credit card, telephone, Internet service provider, and e-mail \nrecords as well as customer transaction information. These NSLs are \ngoverned by strict gag orders that prevent companies from telling their \ncustomers that their records were given to the FBI.\n  As this description suggests, NSLs are very similar to section 215 \nFISA orders but with one very critical difference--NSLs do not require \nthe Government to get any court approval whatsoever. While NSLs can be \nan important tool in our fight against terrorism, their unfettered and \nunchecked use makes them susceptible to abuse that infringes upon the \nprivacy of innocent people. The Senate version of the PATRIOT Act \nreauthorization bill created important checks on the power to issue and \nenforce NSLs--protections absent from the conference report--without \nhindering the effectiveness of this law enforcement tool.\n  Other sections of the conference report give rise to additional \nconcerns. The conference report would give law enforcement the free-\nwheeling power to impose roving ``John Doe'' wiretaps without the \nsafeguards needed to protect innocent Americans from unnecessary \nsurveillance, casting aside important checks on this power that were \nincluded in the Senate bill. The report would also give the FBI the \nright to enter and search a home or business without providing notice \nto the owner of the residence or business for a month or longer after \nthe search. And the conference report contains a provision that \nseriously curtails the habeas corpus rights of prisoners to challenge \ntheir convictions in court. This provision was in neither the House nor \nSenate bills, and there has been practically no debate on the merits of \nthis change.\n  Apart from the serious civil liberties concerns, perhaps the greatest \nshortcoming of the conference report is its failure to incorporate a \nthreat-and-risk-based formula for the allocation of critical homeland \nsecurity funds to our local communities, States, and first responders. \nThis deficiency was emphasized just last week by the former 9/11 \nCommission, which issued a blistering indictment of our homeland \nsecurity failures.\n  As I said earlier, I have long maintained that protecting the \nsecurity of our citizens and our homeland is the most important \nresponsibility I bear as a Senator. To that end, I believe that to \ntruly make America safe, we need to carefully allocate our homeland \nsecurity resources. We need to make sure that the money gets to where \nit is needed, that our American cities and States living under the \ngreatest threat receive the funding they need to protect themselves. \nUnfortunately, up until now, a substantial portion of our homeland \nsecurity money has been allocated according to congressionally mandated \nformulas that bear little relation to need and risk.\n  Our resources should be dedicated to addressing our most glaring \nweaknesses. During their negotiations, I encouraged my House and Senate \ncolleagues considering the PATRIOT Act reauthorization bill to account \nfor this reality in our homeland security funding. I have maintained--\nas the former 9/11 Commission reiterated in its report last week--that \nlawmakers should cease playing politics with the allocation of our \nlimited resources by promoting distribution formulas that ignore risk \nand threat. The Commission's report card was a condemnation of this \nadministration and the Congress, both of whom have demonstrated far too \nlittle urgency in enacting the reforms needed to properly secure our \nhomeland and fight the war on terror.\n  The former 9/11 Commission sent a clear, discernible message to the \nentire Nation last week--reform is needed at all levels of Government. \nThe failure to incorporate in the PATRIOT Act conference report a much-\nneeded threat-based formula for the allocation of homeland security \nfunds is a major shortcoming and needs to be corrected.\n  As I noted at the outset, apart from these concerns, the PATRIOT Act \ncontains provisions that provide law enforcement with important tools \nin the war on terror. Because we cannot afford to be without these \ntools, I am supporting bipartisan legislation that will extend the \nsunsetting provisions of the PATRIOT Act by 3 months. Just because we \nare coming up against the end of the year does not mean we should have \nto compromise the rights of law-abiding Americans. This extension will \npreserve the current state of\n\n[[Page S13714]]\n\nthe law on a temporary basis, giving those working on the bill the \nopportunity to craft a compromise that both safeguards our liberty and \ngives our law enforcement the capabilities they need to effectively \ncombat and investigate terrorist threats. I am also hopeful that during \nthis 3-month extension, those working on the reauthorization bill will \nheed the call of the former 9/11 Commission and include provisions that \nmandate the distribution of homeland security funds on the basis of \nthreat and risk.\n  While we all recognize the importance of equipping our law \nenforcement with the tools they need to effectively combat terrorism, \nwe also must ensure that those tools are administered in a manner that \ndoes not unnecessarily restrict the freedom and liberty that are the \nhallmark of American life. Like all Americans, I am troubled by recent \nreports that the President signed an order in 2002 that authorized the \nNational Security Agency to conduct domestic spying on U.S. citizens \nand foreign nationals in the United States, despite legal prohibitions \nagainst such activity. Likewise, I am disturbed by recent reports that \nthe Department of Defense is maintaining a database in order to monitor \nthe activity of peaceful antiwar groups. The balance between the urgent \ngoal of combating terrorism and the safeguarding of our most \nfundamental constitutional freedoms is not always an easy one to draw. \nHowever, they are not incompatible, and unbridled and unchecked \nexecutive power is not the answer.\n  I believe the conference report falls short of this goal, and I am \nhopeful that with more time, those negotiating these provisions will \nfind the proper balance.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I would like to state for the record that I \nam disappointed we were not able to pass a version of the PATRIOT Act \ntoday. My vote against cloture should not be viewed as a vote against \nthe PATRIOT Act. It should be seen as a vote for balance.\n  I think most Americans want legislation that keeps us safer from the \nthreat of terrorism, but they also want their civil liberties \nprotected. The version of the PATRIOT Act, which passed the Senate \nearlier this year with my support, struck that balance. Unfortunately, \nthe conference report we have before us today does not. This conference \nreport is invasive and vague. It takes focus off of preventing \nterrorism instead permitting government fishing expeditions that invade \nthe privacy of all Americans.\n  My vote against cloture should not be seen as a parliamentary move to \nkill this bill. I am voting today to allow conferees more time to get \nit right. I join my colleagues in a bipartisan push to extend the \ncurrent PATRIOT Act 3 months so that the problems that brought this \nbill down can be resolved. It is my hope that the distinguished \nmajority leader allows us to move forward with a vote on this \nextension.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, let me agree with Senators who have \nspoken out very sharply in opposition to the disclosures in the press \nthis morning about ``President Bush Lets U.S. Spy on Callers Without \nCourts.'' That is wrong, clearly and categorically wrong.\n  If you read some of the fine print, there are some indications that \nthere were some level heads within the executive branch. If you get \ndown into the fine print--it takes a lot of reading beyond page 1 and \nthe other headlines--this appears:\n\n       [I]n mid-2004, concerns about the program expressed by \n     national security officials, government lawyers and a judge \n     prompted the Bush administration to suspend elements of the \n     program and revamp it.\n\n  Later the article says:\n\n       Several national security officials say the powers granted \n     the N.S.A. by President Bush go far beyond the expanded \n     counterterrorism powers granted by Congress under the USA \n     PATRIOT Act. . . .\n\n  There is no doubt that this is inappropriate. The chief judge of the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Court stepped in and said: Don't \nprovide this court with any information you got this way to get a \nwarrant. Just don't do it.\n  So if you read the fine print, there were some parts of the system \nwhich were working. But it is inexcusable to have spying on people in \nthe United States without court surveillance in violation of our law, \nbeyond any question. And I can tell you that this will be a matter for \noversight by the Judiciary Committee as soon as we can get to it in the \nnew year--a very high priority item.\n  I might add, by way of addendum, that on a morning when we come to \nhave a vote on the PATRIOT Act, it is a little disconcerting to see \nthese headlines. It is not very good publicity with a broad brush as to \nwhat the Government is doing. The editorials are frequently published \non the day the Senate is to vote. Somebody suggested that the news \nstory, which had been held back by more than a year, was timed as well. \nI certainly would not want to suggest that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania yields back.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from New Hampshire, Mr. Sununu.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized \nfor 3 minutes.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  As was indicated by Senator Craig, this is not a last-minute effort \nto derail a piece of legislation. These are concerns that began with \nthe introduction of the SAFE Act nearly 2 years ago and our goal was \nand still is to make improvements to the PATRIOT Act, and to ensure \nthat it better protects civil liberties without undermining law \nenforcement's ability to do their job in terrorist investigations.\n  I met with the Attorney General after he was confirmed. I know \nSenator Craig and others did the same thing. I spoke to senior White \nHouse staff not weeks, or months, but as long as a year ago and \nunderscored the importance of sitting down and working through the \nlegislation. I made very specific recommendations in just a few key \nareas of the PATRIOT Act and indicated that we could come to an \nagreement on a strong bipartisan bill.\n  I heard effectively nothing in response to that request. Moreover, \neven after all of our requests, no substantive material has been \nprovided to argue how our specific changes would weaken or undermine \nlaw enforcement's ability to do its job in pursuing terrorists. A \nstandard should be to put in place which will protect civil liberties \nno matter who holds the power in the executive, the legislative or the \njudicial branches.\n  So we are here today with a conference report that has many \nshortcomings, including a 215 standard that is too broad and could \npotentially be abused. There is no reason why we cannot clarify it to \nassure a connection to a specific spy or a terrorist. The conference \nreport also has no meaningful judicial review of national security \nletters. Specifically there is a gag order requirement on national \nsecurity letters that can only be overturned by a showing of bad faith \non the part of the Federal Government. This is a requirement that will \nnever be met by any individual or small business.\n  There is no judicial review explicit of the 215 gag order in the \nbill. This section requires that all evidence from the recipient of a \n215 order is kept, even if that evidence is unclassified. It requires \nthat if you are the target of one of these orders you must identify any \nlawyer you speak with to the FBI. To the best of my knowledge, this is \na provision that exists nowhere else in law and could have a chilling \neffect on the individual's right to counsel. But more importantly it is \nunclear how eliminating this provision, and allowing one who receives a \n215 warrant or national security letter to have the same right to \ncounsel as anyone who is served with a normal subpoena undermines our \nability to fight terrorism. We should not be afraid of a judicial \nreview or setting the appropriate standards of evidence. We need to be \nmindful of Ben Franklin's words over 200 years ago: Those who would \ngive up essential liberty in the pursuit of a little temporary security \ndeserve neither liberty nor security.\n  We could pass a 6-month extension or take up the Senate bill which is \non the calender and still respect important freedoms. We need to be \nmore vigilant and we can do better.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield up to 3 minutes to another member \nof the\n\n[[Page S13715]]\n\nconference, the distinguished Senator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my friend from Vermont.\n  Mr. President, when this bill left the Senate, under the leadership \nof Senators Specter and Leahy, we had a balanced bill with provisions \nwhich protected both our security and our liberty. We are all very much \nin their debt for the bill that left the Senate a few months ago. But \nwhat now has come back to the Senate is a bill which contains \nprovisions which could sweep into the net of a fishing expedition the \nmost private records of innocent Americans. The conference report \namends section 215 of the PATRIOT Act. This is one of many examples, \nand 3 minutes only allows one example. Section 215 permits the \nGovernment to seek court orders, to compel the production of any \ntangible thing, including library and medical records, in foreign \nintelligence investigations. Under the new provision, the Government \nneed not describe, much less identify, a particular person to whom the \nrecords relate. The PATRIOT Act's standard in the conference report \nfails to narrow the scope of records that the Government can subpoena \nto less than the entire universe of records of people who, for \ninstance, patronize the library or visit a doctor's office.\n  One example of that: The Government could seek all of a doctor's \nrecords, if it has an allegation that some unidentified patient of the \ndoctor was sending money to an organization in the Middle East that was \nbeing looked at as part of a foreign intelligence investigation and the \ngovernment thought that reviewing all of the records of that doctor \nmight help identify that unidentified person.\n  Therefore, the Government argues, all of that doctor's records are \nrelevant to a foreign intelligence investigation.\n  The same thing with library records; all of a library's records would \nbe subject to being turned over to the Government if the Government has \nan allegation that somebody, one unidentified person, is using that \nlibrary for some purpose; for instance, its computer, to have access to \nsome organization in the Middle East that is involved in a terrorist \norganization. Everybody's library records would be swept into that net.\n  When this bill left the Senate, it had protective provisions against \nthat. There had to be a showing, not just of relevance to a foreign \nintelligence investigation, there had to be a showing that the records \nsought were relevant and either pertained to a foreign power or an \nagent of a foreign power, were relevant to the activities of a \nsuspected agent of a foreign power who is the subject of an authorized \ninvestigation, or pertained to an individual in contact with or known \nto be a suspected agent. In other words, the order had to be linked to \nsome identifiable individual or suspected agent. Those protections are \nmissing.\n  This is not the first time that Congress has addressed this issue. \nFor instance, the Internal Revenue Code places limitations on what it \ncalls ``John Doe'' summons for the production of certain taxpayer \nrecords.\n  Under 26 U.S.C. 2709 any summons which:\n\n       Does not identify the person with respect to whose \n     liability the summons is issued may be served only after a \n     court proceeding in which the Secretary establishes that--\n       (1) the summons relates to the investigation of a \n     particular person or ascertainable group or class of persons,\n       (2) there is a reasonable basis for believing that such \n     person or group or class of persons may fail or may have \n     failed to comply with any provision of any internal revenue \n     law, and\n       (3) the information sought to be obtained from the \n     examination of the records or testimony (and the identity of \n     the person or persons with respect to whose liability the \n     summons is issued) is not readily available from other \n     sources.\n\n  Some kind of narrowing language should be included in the Patriot Act \nfor 215 orders. Without it, the PATRIOT Act authorizes the rankest kind \nof fishing expedition.\n\n  In addition to the problem with the standard for issuing 215 order, a \ngag order can be imposed by the FBI to prevent the library from telling \npeople that their records were turned over. That means innocent \nAmericans might never know that the government was looking into their \nreading habits or medical records. Further, while some argue that the \nrecipient of a gag order could challenge that gag order in court, the \nconference report is not at all clear on this point. During staff \nnegotiations, language that would have clarified the right to challenge \na gag order was rejected. The idea of a permanent, unreviewable \nrestraint on the First Amendment rights of American citizens is deeply \ntroubling.\n  To add insult to injury, if the library wanted to seek legal advice, \nthis conference report requires the library to tell the government who \nit had consulted even if the lawyer consulted had turned down the case.\n  The conference report is similarly flawed in its treatment of \nNational Security Letters or NSLs. NSLs compel phone companies and \nbanks, for example, to turn over certain customer records. The \ngovernment can issue an NSL without going to court. And, like 215 court \norders, NSLs can be issued without identifying anyone in particular \nthat the government suspects is a terrorist or spy. Again, the \ngovernment does not have to show any connection between the records \nsought and a person who the government thinks is a terrorist or spy. \nAnd like 215 orders, the government can impose a gag order on the \nrecipient of an NSL.\n  While the conference report does permit recipients of NSLs to \nchallenge gag orders in court, it severely constrains the court's \ndiscretion to review the gag order, potentially rendering the review \nmeaningless. Under the conference report, if the Attorney General or \nanother specified senior official certifies that disclosure may \nendanger national security or harm diplomatic relations, the court may \nmodify or set it aside it only if it finds ``bad faith'' on behalf of \nthe government.\n  And, like 215 court orders, if the recipient of an NSL wanted to seek \nlegal advice before turning over records, the conference report would \nrequire the recipient to tell the government who they had consulted.\n  Also troubling about the NSL authority is that there is no \nrequirement that the government destroy records acquired with an NSL \nthat are irrelevant to the investigation under which they've been \ngathered. These are records that relate to innocent Americans. The \ngovernment should be required to destroy them if they contain no \nrelevant material.\n  I outlined many of my concerns in a December 7th letter to the \nChairman and Ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. I'd ask \nconsent that a copy of that letter be placed in the record.\n  As I and my fellow Senate Democratic conferees said in a December 8th \nletter to the Chairmen of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees, \nthe conference report falls short of what the American people have \nevery reason to expect Congress to achieve in defending their rights \nwhile advancing their security. Congress should not rush ahead to enact \nflawed legislation to meet a deadline that is within our power to \nextend. We owe it to the American people to get this right. If three \nmore months are needed to make this an acceptable bill, then we should \ntake and prudently use that time.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter dated \nDecember 7, 2005.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, December 7, 2005.\n     Senator Arlen Specter,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee, Dirksen Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n     Senator Patrick Leahy,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Judiciary Committee, Dirksen Senate \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Specter: The USA PATRIOT Act responded to the \n     terrorist attacks of September 11th by giving law enforcement \n     agencies important new tools to use in combating terrorism. \n     However, as I said when the Senate passed the bill, the \n     PATRIOT Act is not perfect. The bill's sunset provisions give \n     us the opportunity to revisit the law so we can both protect \n     national security and the civil liberties of American \n     citizens.\n       As we have discussed, I am troubled that, in some important \n     areas, the most recent draft of the conference report fails \n     to achieve that goal. Some of my concerns are described \n     below.\n       Standard for 215 court orders--The bill passed by the \n     Senate achieved a reasonable middle ground between the \n     standard that existed prior to the PATRIOT Act and that\n\n[[Page S13716]]\n\n     which the PATRIOT Act established for the FBI to access \n     sensitive records of American citizens with Section 215 \n     orders. These orders can compel things like library records \n     that reveal the reading habits of American citizens and \n     sensitive medical records. While technical changes to the \n     Senate-passed language may be warranted, I am concerned that \n     the draft conference report eliminates the nexus required in \n     the Senate-passed bill between the records sought and the \n     target of an investigation. I believe that the relevance \n     standard, which the conference report would instead establish \n     for access to these records, does not cure the problem.\n       Nondisclosure requirements for 215 court orders--The most \n     recent draft conference report permits the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation (FBI) to attach nondisclosure requirements to a \n     215 court order but does not permit recipients of such orders \n     to challenge those nondisclosure requirements in court. I am \n     troubled by what could amount to a permanent, unreviewable \n     restraint on the First Amendment rights of American citizens. \n     I am also troubled that, while the draft permits recipients \n     of 215 orders to disclose the receipt of such an order to a \n     lawyer to obtain legal advice, it requires recipients to tell \n     the FBI, if asked, from whom they have sought or plan to seek \n     legal advice on how to respond to the order.\n       Nondisclosure requirements for National Security Letters \n     (NSLs)--The most recent draft conference report permits \n     recipients to challenge nondisclosure requirements attached \n     to NSLs. However, under the draft report, the court may only \n     modify or set aside an NSL nondisclosure requirement if there \n     is no reason to believe that disclosure may endanger national \n     security, interfere with an investigation, diplomatic \n     relations or endanger the life or physical safety of a \n     person. In addition, if the Attorney General or another \n     specified senior official certifies that disclosure may \n     endanger national security or harm diplomatic relations, the \n     court's discretion to modify or set aside the nondisclosure \n     requirement is virtually eliminated. In addition, like 215 \n     orders, the draft permits recipients to disclose the receipt \n     of an NSL to a lawyer to obtain legal advice, but also \n     requires recipients to tell the FBI, if asked, from whom they \n     have sought or plan to seek legal advice on how to respond to \n     the order.\n       Destruction of irrelevant NSL records--The latest draft \n     conference report contains no requirement that the government \n     destroy records acquired with an NSL that are irrelevant to \n     the investigation under which they were gathered. The \n     government should be required to ``minimize'' the records of \n     innocent American citizens that are acquired though the \n     issuance of an NSL.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Carl Levin.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an additional \n5 minutes be given to each side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to adding 5 minutes to each \nside?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, if they need more time, I am glad to \nagree with the distinguished ranking member.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Wisconsin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Vermont, not \nonly for yielding time but for his tremendous leadership on this issue. \nI am deeply grateful for it.\n  Let me echo what Senator Kennedy said.\n  This morning we saw an astounding story in the New York Times. Since \n2002, the Government has been reportedly wiretapping the international \nphone and e-mail conversations of hundreds, even thousands of people \ninside the United States without wiretap orders. If you want to talk \nabout abuses, I can't imagine a more shocking example of an abuse of \npower, to eavesdrop on American citizens without first getting a court \norder based on some evidence that they are possibly criminals, \nterrorists, or spies. It is truly astonishing to read that this \nadministration would go this far beyond the bounds of the statutes and \nthe Constitution. We, as an institution, have a duty and the obligation \nto get to the bottom of this.\n  I hope this morning's revelation drives home to people that this body \nmust be absolutely vigilant in its oversight of Government power. I \ndon't want to hear again from the Attorney General or anyone on this \nfloor that this Government has shown it can be trusted to use the power \nwe give it with restraint and care. This shocking revelation ought to \nsend a chill down the spine of every Senator and every American.\n  When we look at section 215 of the PATRIOT Act, remember this is the \nsection where Attorney General Ashcroft once said that librarians \nconcerned about the privacy rights of their patrons were \n``hysterical.'' But then the Attorney General conceded at his \nnomination hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee that some changes \nwould be justified. Unfortunately, the administration was not willing \nto make the real changes to that provision that are necessary to \nprotect the rights and freedoms of innocent Americans.\n  The provisions of the bill related to national security letters are \nalso deficient. There is no requirement that the records sought under \nthat authority, which doesn't involve a court at all, have some \nconnection to a suspected terrorist or spy. The judicial review that \nthe conference report allows after the fact of the national security \nletter itself and the mandatory gag order is a mirage. After what the \nTimes reported this morning, no one in this body should be comfortable \nwith a government having this kind of unreviewable power.\n  This conference report is inadequate, and it should not be passed. I \nbelieve it will not pass.\n  Let me talk, finally, to what happens if the cloture motion fails. Do \nthose who oppose the conference report want the PATRIOT Act to expire? \nOf course not. It is false to suggest that we do, and it is shameful to \nthreaten that that is what will happen if the Senate does not approve \nthis conference report. The only way the PATRIOT Act will expire at the \nend of this year is if the proponents of the conference report in this \nbody or the other body block alternative reauthorization bills that can \neasily pass with widespread bipartisan support. Now is not the time for \nbrinkmanship or threats. Now is the time to do the right thing for the \nAmerican people and for the constitutional rights and freedoms that \nmake our country great.\n  I am very proud to be part of a bipartisan coalition working together \nto strengthen protections for civil liberties in the PATRIOT Act. The \ndemonstration of bipartisanship on this floor over the last few days \nhas been simply remarkable. We have stayed together ever since our \nbill, the SAFE Act, was first introduced. We knew that a time would \ncome when we would have to take a stand. Now we have. We are united \ntoday, as we were then.\n  This is not a partisan issue. This is an American issue. This is a \nconstitutional issue. We can come together to give the Government the \ntools it needs to fight terrorism and protect the rights and freedoms \nof innocent citizens, and we can do this before the end of this year. \nBut first we must keep this inadequate conference report from becoming \nlaw by voting no on cloture.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield up to 3 minutes to the \ndistinguished Senator from Colorado.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized for 3 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, once again I thank the distinguished \nSenator from Vermont and the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania \nfor their leadership on this effort. I wish to take this opportunity to \nonce again express my serious concerns about the PATRIOT Act conference \nreport that is currently before the Senate.\n  As I stated yesterday, as a former attorney general, I am very \nfamiliar with the needs of the more than 800,000 men and women working \nin law enforcement throughout our country, including those engaged in \nthe fight against terrorism. For that reason, I support extending all \nthe expiring powers of the USA PATRIOT Act.\n  I firmly believe we can extend those powers while at the same time \nproviding sufficient checks on those powers to protect America's \nfundamental civil liberties. That is what the bipartisan SAFE Act did. \nThat is what the bipartisan, unanimously supported Senate bill did. \nThat is what this conference report could have done if it simply \naddressed the modest concerns my colleagues and I laid out in our \nletter to conferees with respect to section 215, national security \nletters, and sneak-and-peek searches.\n  Unfortunately, these concerns were not addressed in the conference \nreport, and I am left with no choice but to\n\n[[Page S13717]]\n\nwork with my colleagues, both Democrats and Republicans, to defeat the \nbill before us.\n  This morning, the Washington Post and New York Times reported that \nPresident Bush signed an Executive order authorizing the National \nSecurity Agency to eavesdrop on American citizens without a warrant. \nThese reports suggest that the phone calls and e-mails of hundreds, \nperhaps even thousands, of Americans have been monitored over the past \n3 years without the approval of a judge or even the approval of the \nsecret FISA court. These allegations, if true, are deeply troubling. If \nwe needed a wake-up call about the need for adequate civil liberties \nprotections to be written into our laws, this is the wake-up call.\n  The bill before us does not contain the needed protections. We still \nhave the time to get it right. Several of my colleagues and I have \nintroduced legislation to extend the current PATRIOT Act for 3 months \nso we can get back to the table and make the necessary and vital \nimprovements that will protect our rights under our Constitution.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against invoking cloture and in favor of \ngiving Congress the time it needs to preserve the basic rights and \nfreedoms of all Americans.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, permit me to interject very briefly just \nto correct some of the misstatements which have been made that crop up \nagain and again. This bill is not understood. This bill is not \nunderstood by Senators who are making representations on the floor \nwhich are not correct. I don't suggest they are doing it deliberately, \nbut they don't know the bill.\n  The argument has been made that the recipient of a national security \nletter has to tell the FBI the identity of his lawyer. That is simply \nnot true.\n  The conference report reads:\n\n       In no circumstance shall a person be required to inform the \n     Director of the FBI or such designee that the person intends \n     to consult an attorney to obtain legal advice or legal \n     assistance.\n\n  The representation is made here again and again that in section 215, \nthere does not have to be a connection to a terrorism investigation or \nsomeone suspected of being a terrorist. The conference report does add \na provision to the three criteria for foreign power, but the court has \nto make a determination on a factual showing that there is a terrorism \ninvestigation that does involve foreigners and that records are sought \nfrom another person, albeit not identified with one of the three \ncriteria, in order to carry on the investigation.\n  Again and again, the essence of the protection of civil rights \ntraditionally has been that you interpose an impartial magistrate \nbetween the policeman and the citizen, and that protection is given \nunder section 215.\n  The argument has been made repeatedly that under the national \nsecurity letter, there is no review. That is simply not the case. The \nrecipient goes to a lawyer who can challenge the national security \nletter in court and have it quashed, eliminated, dispensed with, on a \nshowing that it is unreasonable.\n  If you get to the national security issue, then it is different with \nrespect to a bad-faith showing. There is judicial review beforehand on \nthe very broad term of being unreasonable, which is a hallmark of \nAmerican law in auto accident cases and antitrust cases every time you \nturn around. The reasonable standard is traditional under our law.\n  I yield to the Senator from Arizona, who has requested 2 minutes, and \nhe can take whatever time he chooses.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I compliment the Senator from Pennsylvania on \na job exceedingly well done in trying to find a way that we can \nreauthorize the PATRIOT Act, with very emotional feelings on all sides \nof the issue and working through very difficult compromises, especially \nafter the conference committee in which it would appear to me--and I \nthink even our colleagues who oppose the bill would agree--the end \nresult is probably about 80 percent Senate product and about 20 percent \nHouse product.\n  This is a defining moment. There are no more compromises to be made, \nno more extensions of time. The bill is what it is now, and it is very \nunfair and unrealistic to expect that either the House of \nRepresentatives would concede to the Senate position 100 percent or \nthat the President would do so after what he has now said. As a result, \nwe are going to have an opportunity to vote yes or no.\n  One of my colleagues said this is not a partisan issue. If 90-plus \npercent of the Democrats vote against cloture and 90-plus percent of \nthe Republicans vote for cloture, it is hard to argue that is not \npartisan. It is true that this should not be a partisan issue, but \nhaving worked through it to the extent we have, and having had the very \nstrong support in the House of Representatives with over I think it was \n44 Democrats in the House of Representatives voting for reauthorization \nof the PATRIOT Act, it seems to me that the Senate would do well to \nalso try to act here in a more bipartisan way and not to have a \npartisan vote.\n  We need to reauthorize the PATRIOT Act. It is the tool for our law \nenforcement and intelligence agencies to help protect us from \nterrorists. Just as we send our men and women into battle with good \ntraining and equipment, we have to do the same thing with law \nenforcement and our intelligence agencies. If we deny them the key \ntool, the PATRIOT Act, they are not going to be able to do their job to \nprotect us. And there is no more time to stretch this out with maybes \nor let's negotiate more, and so on. This act will expire on December \n31. My colleagues either vote yes to reauthorize it or no, not to \nreauthorize it. There is no middle ground.\n  I will say this as directly and seriously as I can. I doubt there is \nanyone in this Chamber today who would argue with the proposition that \nwe needed to tear down the wall between the law enforcement and \nintelligence agencies. The PATRIOT Act does that. The wall goes right \nback up again on January 1. Is that what we want? God help us if there \nis some kind of terrorist attack when we are not protected by the \nPATRIOT Act and the act could have enabled our law enforcement or our \nintelligence people to help protect us. We will have to answer for that \nif we don't vote to extend the PATRIOT Act.\n  I implore my colleagues to put partisanship aside, to consider the \nfact that not everybody can get 100 percent of what they want, to \nrecognize that the House of Representatives has made a tremendous \nconcession to us, whether you talk about the period of time, the \nsection 215 concessions, and, of course, the sunset concessions.\n  I found it very difficult myself to sign the conference report \nbecause, frankly, we had made it so difficult for law enforcement to do \nits job with some of the compromises that were made, but they were made \nin order to achieve a consensus on which we could vote. Now we find \nthat consensus in jeopardy.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to think very carefully about \nwhat they are about to do. If they vote against cloture, they are \nvoting to allow the PATRIOT Act to expire. We will not have that tool \navailable for law enforcement and intelligence agencies to protect us \nfrom terrorists. Is that what you want? I daresay the American people \nwill hold us accountable if anything happens and we are not able to \nreauthorize the PATRIOT Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, before the Senator from Arizona sits \ndown, I wish to ask him a question to further elaborate upon a point he \nhas made.\n  The President has said that he is not going to sign an extension of 3 \nmonths or, by implication, any extension of time. So if the conference \nreport is not adopted so the President can sign it, there will be no \nPATRIOT Act in effect after December 31.\n  The Senator from Arizona has talked about the wall.\n  The Senator was on the Intelligence Committee the day he came to the \nSenate. He was elected in 1994. I chaired the Intelligence Committee of \nthe 104th Congress. He has been on it. He has been on Judiciary. He has \nbeen a leader on this measure. As the Senator said, he had trouble \nsigning the conference report. By the way, I thank him for signing the \nconference report. Without his signature, we could not have filed it.\n\n[[Page S13718]]\n\n  As to the other provisions beside the wall, if the PATRIOT Act \nlapses, and there is none, what will the effect be on the fight against \nterrorism?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for his remarks. We know \nof two stories that the 9/11 Commission wrote following the \ninvestigation into what went wrong. What they found was that there was \nnot only the wall that separated our intelligence and law enforcement \nofficials from being able to speak to each other, but other problems \nwith the law that we corrected with the PATRIOT Act. Had the PATRIOT \nAct been in effect prior to 9/11, it is possible that not all of or \neven part of 9/11 would have happened.\n  There are two specific stories. One related to Zacarias Moussaoui, \nthe other related to two fellows by the name of Hazmi and al Mihdhar. \nThese were the fellows who used library computers to verify their \nairline reservations on 9/11. We knew that they were connected--well, \none agency with the Government knew that they were connected with the \nal-Qaida. The other agency knew that they had tried to come into the \nUnited States and decided that maybe we should try to find them but had \nno idea how important it was to try to find them. And had we been able \nto be on their tail at this time and find out that they were verifying \nairline reservations on September 11, knowing that they were connected \nto al-Qaida and were up to no good, history might well be different \nthan it is today.\n  How on Earth we could allow the corrections in the law that we put in \nplace as a result of our investigation to lapse is beyond me. The \nterrorists have not stopped their efforts to attack us, and largely we \nhave been free from attack because of things such as the PATRIOT Act.\n  So the chairman is exactly right. We corrected the errors that were \nbrought to our attention that prevented us from doing what needed to be \ndone before September 11. That is what this PATRIOT Act conference \nreport is all about. The act needs to be reauthorized. Our people need \nthat tool to protect us. Why would we allow it to lapse, especially on \na partisan basis? We need to think very carefully about what we are \nabout to do. I hope for the sake of the American people and our \nsecurity that the Senate will act responsibly and ensure that the \nPATRIOT Act will continue to protect us and not allow it to lapse.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nmandatory quorum under rule XXII be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as I said earlier, I do not question the \npatriotism or the intent to stop terrorists of either those who vote \nfor or those who vote against cloture. I hope others would not. If we \nwanted to make this a partisan thing, we could have brought out the \nfact that even under the laws that existed before 9/11, it was this \nadministration's Department of Justice that ignored clear warnings and \nevidence that they had, which the 9/11 Commission and others have \npointed out might well have prevented the terrorist attacks. That could \nhave been done with or without the PATRIOT Act.\n  All of us rallied behind the administration, even though the attack \noccurred during this administration and the attack occurred even though \nthis administration's Department of Justice had information which might \nhave stopped the attack.\n  I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished Senator from New York, Mr. \nSchumer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized for 3 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first I want to thank both my colleagues \nfrom Pennsylvania and from Vermont for their fine efforts on this \nlegislation. I went to bed last night unsure of how to vote on this \nlegislation. I want to give a lot of credit to my colleague from \nPennsylvania. This is a significant improvement over present law. It is \na significant improvement over the House bill and comes a lot closer to \nthe Senate bill than many are giving it credit for. On the other hand, \neven before last night, I had real doubts that we did not correct the \nformula in terms of distributing aid which definitely hurts my State of \nNew York. But as I said, I went to bed undecided.\n  Today's revelation that the Government listened in on thousands of \nphone conversations without getting a warrant is shocking and has \ngreatly influenced my vote. If this Government will discard a law that \nhas worked well for over 30 years, without a whit of discussion or \nnotice, then for sure we better be certain that we have safeguards on \nthat Government. The balance between security and liberty is a delicate \none, and there is great room for disagreement as to where that ought to \ncome down.\n  I do not question the motives of anybody. I tend to be fairly hawkish \non these types of things, as my colleagues know. But there is one thing \nfor sure: there ought to be discussion, there ought to be debate. \nWhenever there is discussion and debate, we usually come out right, and \nthat is true on the wiretap law. When J. Edgar Hoover and other leaders \nof the FBI had unchecked power, there were abuses. We put in an \nindependent arbiter, a judge. We put in a standard, probable cause, and \nneither the prosecutor community nor the defense community has \ncomplained.\n\n  So then why, with the flick of a wrist, did this administration \nignore those laws and listen in on conversations of hundreds of people \nwhen it would have been so easy to obey the law? Today's revelation \nmakes it crystal clear that we have to be very careful, and Senator \nLeahy's suggestion that we renew the present law for 3 months and come \nto an agreement like we did in the Senate that all can live with is \neminently sensible.\n  One final point. My good friend from Arizona and I respect the \nsincerity on this issue. We have written parts of this law together, \nparticularly the lone wolf provision. But he says that we will have no \nlaw if we do not vote for cloture.\n  I ask unanimous consent for an additional 30 seconds.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Yes, with 30 given on the other side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator is recognized for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Thirty minutes, I will take that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair is out of order. The Senator is \nrecognized for 30 seconds.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the chair for his generosity.\n  If cloture is not invoked and the opportunity to renew this law for 3 \nmonths or 6 months comes before us, and the President vetoes it, it \nwill be crystal clear that he is putting politics above safety because \nthe bottom line is, the present law is, if anything, tougher than the \nlaw that is on the books.\n  Let us not invoke the threat that the President will not extend the \nPATRIOT Act. It would be a dereliction of his duty as Commander in \nChief and chief law enforcement officer of this land.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it has been claimed that somehow the so-\ncalled wall between law enforcement and intelligence would go back up \nif the PATRIOT Act expires. That is not true. Even if the relevant \nchange made by the PATRIOT Act expired, there would be no legal barrier \nto information-sharing, and no wall would go back up, because FISA as \nit existed pre-PATRIOT Act contained no such barrier. So ruled the FISA \ncourt of review in November 2002 at the request of the government. It \nheld that the change we made in the PATRIOT Act to take down the wall \nwas not necessary, that FISA never required a wall, and that the \nDepartment of Justice unnecessarily imposed bureaucratic constraints on \nsharing information. So let us not delude ourselves into thinking that \nsomehow the wall goes back up if PATRIOT expires. It does not. It was \nnot legally required in the first place.\n  How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes 48 seconds.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield it to the distinguished Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Vermont for \nyielding\n\n[[Page S13719]]\n\nthe time and for his leadership on this issue. I voted for the PATRIOT \nAct. It was a bit of a leap of faith because I was not sure. I did not \nknow if we were giving the Government more authority and more power \nthan it needed to keep America safe, but I felt, as most Americans did, \nthat in light of September 11, we had to do more to make America safer.\n  The Senator from Vermont, along with the Senator from Utah, came \ntogether on a bipartisan basis and produced a PATRIOT Act to give the \nGovernment more tools to fight terrorism. In their wisdom, they \nunderstood that perhaps we had moved too far and too fast, and they \nsaid at the end of 4 years we would revisit this law and make sure that \nwe had not given up more personal freedom in America than we had to be \nsafe, and that is why we are here today.\n  In the meantime, I joined with a bipartisan coalition, an interesting \ncoalition when one looks at our political spectrum in the Senate. I \njoined with my friend, Larry Craig of Idaho, Senator John Sununu, \nSenator Lisa Murkowski, Senator Russ Feingold, and Senator Ken Salazar \nin a bipartisan coalition that has been working to reform the PATRIOT \nAct for over two years. We studied the PATRIOT Act very carefully and \ncame to the conclusion that certain provisions did not contain adequate \nsafeguards to protect the rights and liberties of Americans. That is \nwhy we introduced the SAFE Act.\n\n  It was our efforts together in the Senate Judiciary Committee and the \ngood leadership of the Senator from Pennsylvania as its chairman that \nresulted in a bill that came out of that committee unanimously. It was \na bipartisan bill that came to the floor to reauthorize the PATRIOT Act \nand passed on the floor by a voice vote. It was not perfect, but it was \na consensus, bipartisan, compromise bill. Then, sadly, it went into a \nconference committee where the most important safeguards were removed, \nwhich brings us to this moment in time.\n  Let me salute the Senator from Pennsylvania. He has argued this issue \non its substance. He has not argued it politically. But he has said \nduring the course of this debate that there have been no verified \nabuses of the PATRIOT Act. I would say to my friend from Pennsylvania, \nit is not the burden of the American people to prove that their rights \nhave been violated. That's not how the American legal system works. We \nshould build in checks and balances to ensure that abuses do not take \nplace in the first instance.\n  Moreover, it is difficult to find verified abuses of the PATRIOT Act \nwhen so many provisions are cloaked in secrecy. In most cases, people \nwill never learn that their medical, tax, or gun records have been \nseized. An individual who receives a Section 215 order or a National \nSecurity Letter is bound by a gag order so he cannot speak out, even if \nhe believes his rights have been violated.\n  Now today's headlines suggest this administration went beyond the \npale in authorizing hundreds and perhaps thousands of warrantless \nwiretaps on Americans in the United States. This violates the long-\nstanding legal requirement that the government must obtain a warrant \nfrom a court in order to eavesdrop on Americans in the United States.\n  If these stories are true, it makes the PATRIOT Act reforms we have \nsuggested even more urgent, and additional reforms may be necessary. \nBut it is certainly premature to approve this flawed conference report \nbefore we learn more about these allegations.\n  The obvious question is this: Whether or not we pass the PATRIOT Act, \nwill the administration argue they have the authority to go forward, \nanyway?\n  What we need to do is to defeat cloture, pass a 3-month extension of \nthis PATRIOT Act, and move on to make changes to the law that are \nneeded to protect our freedom while giving law enforcement the \nauthority they need to fight terrorism. We can be both safe and free in \nAmerica.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania has 47 seconds.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I shall use it. Another correction. The Senator from \nIllinois incorrectly says I have argued that there have been no abuses \nof the PATRIOT Act. I have never made that representation. I don't \nthink you are entitled to credit for not being abusive. That is to be \nexpected. If you have not been abusive, don't look for credit. That is \nwhat you ought to be: not abusive. I have not made that argument.\n  My arguments have been limited squarely to the threat of terrorism, \nand the balance of civil liberties on an itemized approach, one by one \nby one by one, that this is a balanced bill.\n  How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been yielded under the previous \norder.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, on leader time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the PATRIOT Act expires on December 31, but \nthe terrorist threat does not. We have a clear choice before us today: \nDo we advance against terrorism to make America safer or do we retreat \nto the days before 9/11, when terrorists slipped through the cracks. \nAdvance or retreat? It is as simple as that.\n  Some Members of Congress have called for a retreat-and-defeat \nstrategy in Iraq, and that is the wrong strategy in Iraq, and it is the \nwrong strategy here at home. A vote against the PATRIOT Act amounts to \nretreat and defeat here at home, against terrorism. To those who still \nharbor concerns with this bill, I have a simple reply: We have more to \nfear from terrorists than this PATRIOT Act compromise.\n  The compromise includes more civil liberty safeguards than in current \nlaw, more congressional oversight, more judicial review. The same \npeople who criticize the lack of civil liberties in current law are \narguing for a 3-month extension. That makes no sense.\n  It is time to come together to advance, not retreat, from terrorist \nthreats. I urge my colleagues to vote yes, to advance against \nterrorism, to make America safer, and to safeguard our civil liberties.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the clerk will \nreport the motion to invoke cloture.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the Conference \n     Report to accompany H.R. 3199: The U.S. PATRIOT Terrorism \n     Prevention Reauthorization Act of 2005:\n         Chuck Hagel, Jon Kyl, John McCain, Richard Burr, Conrad \n           Burns, Pat Roberts, John Ensign, James Talent, C.S. \n           Bond, Johnny Isakson, Wayne Allard, Norm Coleman, Kay \n           Bailey Hutchison, Mel Martinez, John Thune, Jim DeMint, \n           Jeff Sessions, Bill Frist, Arlen Specter.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent the mandatory quorum call \nhas been waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the \nconference report to accompany H.R. 3199, the U.S. PATRIOT Terrorism \nPrevention Reauthorization Act of 2005, shall be brought to a close?\n  The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule.

On this vote, the yeas are 52, the nays are \n47. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is rejected.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I now enter a motion to reconsider the vote \nby which cloture was not invoked.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion to reconsider is entered.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I discussed this with the distinguished \nmajority leader. I will make this unanimous-consent request.\n\n\n                   Unanimous-Consent Request--S. 2082\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Judiciary Committee \nbe discharged from further consideration of S. 2082, the 3-month \nextension of the PATRIOT Act, that the Senate proceed to its immediate \nconsideration, the bill be read a third time and passed, and the motion \nto reconsider be laid on the table. And I do that because that would \nkeep the PATRIOT Act in existence after December 31.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. FRIST. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, as I stated earlier this morning and \nyesterday, I oppose a short-term extension of the PATRIOT Act. The \nHouse opposes such an extension. The President will not sign such an \nextension. Why? Because extending the PATRIOT Act for a short period of \ntime simply does not do enough. The same people who criticized the lack \nof civil liberties safeguards in current law are arguing for an \nextension. That does not make sense.\n  This compromise we have discussed over the last several days does \naddress more civil liberty safeguards than current law, more \ncongressional oversight, more judicial review. Thus, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we are at an interesting point. We have \nseen an enormous amount of work done by the distinguished senior \nSenator from Pennsylvania, who has worked in good faith with members on \nboth sides of the aisle; and, I might say, it has been done with a \ngreat deal of work by myself, but also it has been done with a great \ndeal of work by those who both supported cloture and opposed cloture.\n  Now, one thing that should unite all of us is our opposition to \nterrorism. We would not serve in this body, actually in this building \nthat faced a possible devastating terrorist attack, if we did not care \nboth for our country and for the Senate and for the Capitol.\n  But there are ways of securing our liberties and ways in which it can \nappear we are but, instead, we are taking them away. We saw this \namazing step in today's news, where Americans are being spied on, not \nthrough any court order, not through any act of Congress, not with any \noversight, not with any check and balance, but simply by a stroke of \nthe pen of the President, following the advice of the same people in \nthe Department of Justice who advised him that torture was legal.\n\n  We have rejected the concept that torture is legal. We should reject \nthe concept that we can have Americans spy on Americans with no checks \nand balances in a free and democratic Nation such as ours. What we \nwant--and I have written many parts of the PATRIOT Act--and what we \nshould have is checks and balances. A democratic nation does not exist \nwithout them.\n  I would hope Republicans and Democrats would come together, and the \nadministration, and find a way to go forward with those things that \nprotect America. But ultimately, America is most protected when we have \nthe checks and balances that protect our liberties, the liberties we \nfought a Revolution to gain, and fought a Civil War and two World Wars \nto preserve. We can do that. There are cooler heads here. There are \ndistinguished Senators from both parties who can bring this about.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the PATRIOT Act remains on the floor. I \nswitched my vote in order to recommit. So in essence, it is 53 to 47. I \nsimply ask that debate continue. Let everybody look at what is in the \nbill. We have had excellent debate the last couple of days. What this \nvote has basically said is that we don't stop debating it. I encourage \npeople, especially those who voted against cloture, to take advantage \nof this opportunity to discuss and debate and come forward. We remain \non the PATRIOT Act, and the vote right now speaks for itself. We accept \nthat. But the debate will continue on this very important bill. Again, \nwe will not see a short-term extension.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I voted against cloture on the \nPATRIOT Act reauthorization conference report. I want to make clear \nthat this vote was not about whether I support reauthorizing the \nPATRIOT Act--I do. This vote was about whether I thought that the \nsignificant and unnecessary invasions into the privacy rights of all \nAmericans were necessary to protect our national security--I do not.\n  Last July, the Senate passed by unanimous consent a PATRIOT Act \nreauthorization bill. I supported that bipartisan, compromise bill. \nEven though it did not contain all the privacy protections I would have \nliked, it took a lot of steps towards improving the problems in the \nPATRIOT Act that have become evidence since its passage. If that bill \nwas on the floor today, I would support it.\n  But it is not. What we do have on the floor is a conference report \nthat fails to address some of the most serious problems with the \nPATRIOT Act. For example, its version of Section 215 allows the \nGovernment to obtain library, medical, gun records, and other sensitive \npersonal information on a mere showing that those records are relevant \nto an authorized intelligence investigation. That is it. Relevance is \nall that is required. The Senate bill, on the other hand would have \nestablished a three part test to determine whether the records have \nsome connection to a suspected terrorist or spy. This seemingly small \nchange will help prevent investigations which invade the privacy of \nAmerican citizens that may have no connection to any suspected \nterrorist or spy. This is an important restriction.\n  In addition, unlike the Senate bill the conference report provides no \nmechanism for the recipient of a Section 215 order to challenge the \naccompanying automatic, permanent gag order. The FISA, Foreign \nIntelliegence Surveillance Act, court reviews are simply not \nsufficient. They have the power only to review the Government \napplication for the underlying Section 215 order. They do not have the \npower to make an individualized determination about whether a gag order \nshould accompany it. So the recipient of a Section 215 order is \nautomatically silenced forever. How is that fair? How is that \nconsistent with our democratic principles?\n  The conference report doesn't provide judicial review of National \nSecurity Letters either. The Senate bill did. Judicial review is one of \nour best checks on unnecessary Government intrusion into individual \nprivacy. Why deny it to our citizens?\n  Lastly, I would like to mention the problem with the conference \nreports provisions on the so-called sneak-and-peek search warrants. \nUnlike the Senate bill, the conference report does not include any \nprotections against these warrants. Rather than requiring that the \ngovernment notify the target of these warrants within 7 days, as the \nSenate bill did, the conference report requires notification within 30 \ndays of the search. Thirty days. That is an awfully long time to go \nbefore learning that you have been the subject of a Government search.\n  These are just a few of the problems with the conference report. They \nare\n\n[[Page S13721]]\n\nthe most significant problems. Those in support know that it is flawed, \nbut they are creating artificial time pressure to force us to approve \nthe bill, flawed as it may be.\n  I realize that 16 provisions of the PATRIOT Act are set to expire. I \ncertainly do not want that to happen. But passing this conference \nreport is not the only way to prevent their expiration. That is why I \nhave cosponsored legislation to extend those provisions by three months \nto allow us time to fix the problems with the conference report. If \nthat effort fails and the PATRIOT Act expires, the blame rests only \nwith the White House and leadership that controls the House and the \nSenate. There was and remains a simple, unified way to get this done, \nand they rejected it.\n  There is no reason why we cannot be safe and free. The Senate bill \naccomplished this. And, I will keep working with my colleagues in the \nSenate to ensure that whatever legislation we ultimately pass to \nreauthorize the PATRIOT Act also accomplishes this.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today the Senate was presented with a false \nchoice on the conference report to H.R. 3199, the USA PATRIOT Act. That \nis why I voted against the motion to invoke cloture. There is a better \nway that gives us the time we need to thoughtfully debate some very \nweighty constitutional and civil liberty issues. With 90 percent of the \nPATRIOT Act already permanently authorized, we can and should extend \nthe provisions expiring on December 31, 2005, for 3 months.\n  Let me be clear, those of us advocating for a 3-month extension \nsupport reauthorizing the PATRIOT Act. What we want to do is keep the \nlaw intact, exactly as it is right now, so that we can more carefully \ndebate these important matters without feeling rushed by the impending \nadjournment of this session of Congress.\n  Like almost everyone in this Chamber, I voted for the PATRIOT Act \nshortly after the September 11 terrorist attacks. I believed the \nPATRIOT Act would bolster the ability of Federal authorities to conduct \ncriminal and intelligence investigations, to bar and expel foreign \nterrorists from the United States, to separate terrorists from their \nsources of financial support, to punish acts of terrorism, and to \nassist victims of the events of September 11. While I had reservations \nabout some parts of this legislation, the need to address the obvious \nthreat, combined with the fact that many of the more untested \nprovisions in the act were set to expire on December 31, 2005, prompted \nme to vote for the bill.\n  The provision of greater investigative authority to our Nation's law \nenforcement officials is a matter that raises many issues, most \nparticularly, the need to balance Government power and civil liberties. \nCertainly, there is a great onus upon the Department of Justice, DOJ, \nto utilize the awesome authority of the PATRIOT Act in a circumspect \nand cautious manner. At the same time, Congress has a responsibility to \nconduct vigorous oversight on the use of the PATRIOT Act's powers and \nto carefully debate any changes to these powers.\n  In the spring, in anticipation of the impending need to reauthorize \nthe sunsetting provisions of the PATRIOT Act, I cosponsored S. 737, the \nSecurity and Freedom Enhancement, SAFE, Act of 2005. This thoughtful, \nbipartisan legislation was introduced by Senator Craig on April 6, \n2005, and seeks to revise and improve--not eliminate--several of the \nmore controversial provisions of the PATRIOT Act, including roving \nwiretaps, sneak-and-peek searches, and FISA orders for library and \nother personal records.\n  Many of the proposed revisions to the PATRIOT Act in S.737 were \nultimately incorporated in some form into S. 1389, the Senate version \nof the PATRIOT Act reauthorization. S. 1389, the USA PATRIOT Act \nTerrorism Prevention Reauthorization Act, passed by unanimous consent \nin July and the Senate immediately appointed conferees so that the \nHouse and the Senate could begin discussing their very different \nvisions of the reauthorization. Unfortunately, the House waited until \nNovember to appoint its conferees, which in large part is why we are \nnow in the position of having very little time to debate and resolve \nthe differences between the two bills.\n  The Senate's version of the PATRIOT Act attempted to deal with many \nof the civil liberties issues that have come to the fore since the \npassage of the PATRIOT Act. In particular, S. 1389 would require that \nthe Department of Justice convince a judge that a person is connected \nto terrorism or espionage before obtaining their library records, \nmedical records, or other sensitive information. It would require that \ntargets of sneak-and-peek searches are notified within 7 days, instead \nof the undefined delay that is currently permitted under the PATRIOT \nAct. The Senate bill also would prohibit the issuance of ``John Doe'' \nroving wiretaps, which identify neither the person nor the place to be \nput under surveillance.\n  Additionally, S. 1389 would give the recipient of an order for \nsensitive personal information the right to challenge the order in \ncourt on the same grounds they could challenge a grand jury subpoena, \nas well as provide a right to challenge the gag order that currently \nprevents people who receive a request for records from speaking out \neven if they feel the Government is violating their rights. The \nlegislation also requires increased reporting by the DOJ on its use of \nPATRIOT Act powers and sets a 4-year sunset on three provisions \nregarding roving wiretaps, business record orders, and ``lone wolf'' \nsurveillance.\n  Unlike the Senate bill, the House version proposed to permanently \nreauthorize all but two of the expiring provisions--instead it sunsets \nFISA orders for library and other personal records and the roving \nwiretap provision after 10 years--and placed few, if any, limits on \nmany of the expanded law enforcement powers in the PATRIOT Act.\n  Unfortunately, the conference report has removed or weakened some of \nthe most important limits on enhanced investigative powers in the \nSenate bill, particularly those relating to FISA orders for library, \nmedical, and other types of business records about people, National \nSecurity Letters, and notification of sneak-and-peek searches. We need \nto reauthorize the expiring provisions of the PATRIOT Act, but we need \nto do so with procedural safeguards like those in the Senate bill.\n  The Senate is known as the more contemplative body in Congress for a \nreason, and I think we should take the time we need to truly debate and \ndiscuss some important civil liberties issues that the conference \nreport implicates. For this reason, I have cosponsored Senator Sununu's \nbill, S. 2082, which would extend the expiring provisions of the \nPATRIOT Act until March 31, 2006. I believe that 3 months is enough \ntime for us to come back after the holidays and work out the \ndifferences between the House and Senate versions of the PATRIOT Act \nreauthorization. I would encourage all of my colleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeMint). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise to express my disappointment with \nthe vote. This is a very important piece of legislation. It is \nimportant for our country. I wish to say how hard we worked to achieve \nbipartisan support. This bill came up in the Senate for reauthorization \nafter 4 years and virtually no serious criticism of the workings of any \nof the provisions in it. There was a generalized view that we should, \nin fact, extend it.\n  We discussed it in the Judiciary Committee. Some of us who would like \nto strengthen a few provisions to protect this country from terrorists \ndid not make much headway there, but we did achieve one thing: we \nachieved a unanimous vote in the Judiciary Committee--18 to nothing--to \nreport this PATRIOT Act to the floor of the Senate. When it came to the \nfloor of the Senate, we discussed it, and it was cleared by this Senate \nunanimously.\n  It went to conference. The House had a bill. We discussed it in \nconference. Senator Specter led our conferees. For those who wanted the \nSenate bill to win in toto, they were not perfectly happy. But as \nSenator Specter has\n\n[[Page S13722]]\n\nsaid, 80 percent of the bill was the Senate bill. Only a few things \nwere given to the House Members out of the differences in the two \npieces of legislation. It comes back here to be voted on. It is blocked \nfrom an up-or-down vote so it could be passed and made law before it \nexpires at the end of this year.\n  A tremendous amount of effort and work has been placed into making \nthis a piece of legislation we could all unite behind. We thought we \ndid so. We went to conference, and we came out with a bill that is far \nmore like the Senate bill than the House bill.\n  As someone who served in law enforcement for many years, I urge my \ncolleagues to look at the language of the legislation. I don't believe \nthere is a single investigative law enforcement technique in this \nlegislation that is inconsistent with what we have been doing for \nyears. The average county attorney in any city and county in America \ntoday can issue a subpoena for library records. The average county \nattorney can get medical records on one basis--is it relevant to an \ninvestigation that office is conducting? They don't have to get prior \ncourt approval to issue those subpoenas. It is done every day. So there \nhas been confusion. I urge my colleagues to think about it.\n  With regard to the delayed notice search warrants, this law in not \none whit changes the standards for a search warrant. You still have to \nhave all the proof you have to conduct a search of someone's private \nproperty or house. You have to have that. It simply says that you could \ndelay notice to the terrorist organization about what is going on. That \nis law today.\n  As a Federal prosecutor, I have sought approval of a court to delay \nthe notification of a drug dealer. I saw a story recently about a Mafia \ninvestigation in the Northeast. They got a delayed notice warrant under \nbasically American common law. There were no legal standards. Whatever \nthe judge said about how long you would delay in notifying the bad guys \nis what went on in that case.\n  This bill for the first time sets forth statutory standards that must \nbe approved. You must prove to the judge that it is important to the \nsafety of the country or important to the safety of enforcing the law \nthat the notification is delayed. So you don't get that automatically \njust because you ask it; you have to convince a court in advance of \nthat.\n  The section 215 provisions require FISA court prior judicial \napproval. They require reports made to the Congress. They allow \nobjections to be raised.\n  I urge my colleagues to go back and think about the vote you just \ncast in favor of this bill and review and see if there is anything that \noccurred in conference that in any way significantly alters or erodes \nthe liberties this country has known and loved and is determined to \nprotect. I urge my colleagues to do that. If they do, I believe they \nwill feel very confident that there is nothing here that goes against \nwhat we believe is necessary to preserve the liberties with which we \nare familiar. Please do that. If you do, I think you will feel a lot \nbetter about it.\n  I would be glad to discuss any particular point you would raise. As \nwe go forward, I hope people will feel comfortable in casting a \npositive vote for this legislation. It is critical that we not allow it \nto expire. We need to do this bill while we are here. But to continue \nto weaken the legislation, as some have asked, for beyond what we \nagreed to in conference is a mistake. We don't need to continue to \nweaken it. If we weaken it so much that it is not effective, then it is \nnot a good idea.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n\n\n                         Farewell to the Senate\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I would like to give what I think will \nmore than likely be the last speech I give on this great floor, this \nhistoric floor, in front of this deliberative body. I am grateful for \nyour courtesies. It is with bittersweet feeling that I make these \nremarks.\n  I have been honored beyond words to be a United States Senator. I \nthink all of us know that feeling in our hearts and souls. I will be \nforever grateful to the 9 million New Jerseyans who put their trust in \nme and asked Senator Lautenberg and myself, and others before us, to \nrepresent their hopes and dreams at this time and in this place.\n  In the 229 years of our Republic, fewer than 2,000 men and women have \ncome to this floor and represented the voices of the people who elected \nthem or selected them in previous times. And like each of my \npredecessors and those to follow, including Congressman Robert \nMenendez, who will be sworn in to fill out my term, we have all been \nsworn to uphold and protect the Constitution.\n  I now look at the great Senator, Robert Byrd, who has so eloquently \nand so frequently represented the challenge that all of us take on as \nwe are sworn in to be Senators to represent and carry forward those \ntraditions of our Constitution and to serve the interests of our \npeople. So there are really two purposes. I can only hope that the \npeople of New Jersey will believe that has been my sole purpose here on \nthis floor.\n  Now as I take my leave, I guess there will be some folks who will say \nsome nice things about me, and they have. That is a little bit \ndifferent than in the last days of the campaign. It reminds me of a \nJack Benny story. He was giving a presentation and listening to the \npresenter praise him at length. He said, ``I don't deserve this award, \nbut I don't deserve diabetes either.'' I will take the compliments and \nthe kind remarks. I very much appreciate it.\n  I want you to know that I cherish the friendships I have established \nwith the men and women here. I admire the debates--I don't always agree \nwith all of my colleagues--but I always respect and admire the \ncommitments of the men and women who sit on this floor. And I add that \nit is on both sides of the aisle, not just my friends in the Democratic \nParty. Believe me, some of the remarks I have heard in the last few \ndays are a little different than they were 6 years ago when I ran for \nmy good friend Senator Lautenberg's open seat at that time. Ross Baker \nis a commentator on the national political scene, and he teaches at \nRutgers. He told one reporter that the people in New Jersey don't know \nJon Corzine from a cord of wood. Hopefully, we have gotten a little \nfarther down the pike than a cord of wood.\n  This has been one of the most remarkable experiences anyone could \never dream of having. I came here for a clear purpose. I believe in \nAmerican citizenship and the rights we have. We certainly have \nincredible opportunities in this Nation--I have experienced many of \nthem--but it comes with responsibilities. To those of us whom much is \ngiven, much is required. I know that I had no chance to succeed in life \nwithout the kind of great support I have had from my community, my \nNation, and my friends. That is why one comes here--to give back, to \nfight for fairness and the opportunity for all.\n  Senator Durbin knows of the little town in which I grew up. Like so \nmany of you, I have lived the American promise. It is a little town in \ncentral Illinois called Willy Station, with a population of less than \n50. In fact, there are more cows than people there. My father was a \ncorn and soybean farmer. He sold insurance. My mom was a schoolteacher. \nTo have a chance to walk on the floor of the Senate and represent the \ninterests of a great State that is really entirely different than the \nbackground from where I came represents the American promise. I believe \nin it, and I believe we have a responsibility to give back.\n  Both of my parents were good Republicans, Senator Durbin. My mom \nstill is, by the way. I am not sure if she voted for my friend. She had \nbig dreams, and so did my father, about how life would serve us.\n  I grew up at a time when Adlai Stevenson was Governor and then ran \nfor President. Paul Douglas and Paul Simon worked the circuits in \ncentral Illinois. We had great Democratic Senators who passionately \nstood for economic and social justice for all Americans. We had another \ngreat Illinois Senator who worked the same circuits, Everett Dirksen. \nLike my parents, he was a Republican, but he also stood up for the \npromise of justice and equality for everyone in America. He believed \ndeeply enough in those promises to use his position as leader to help \npass the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CORZINE. Yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Lord Byron said, ``Thank God I have done my duty.'' May I \nsay\n\n[[Page S13723]]\n\nto the Senator from New Jersey, he has done his duty. He is a good \nSenator. We will miss you. I will. Thank you for standing up for what \nyou believe. Thank you very much. Bless your heart.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, there is not much that means more than \nthat coming from a great Senator who has served this Nation so much. \nThank you.\n  I was talking about Senator Dirksen. He actually sat at this desk and \nworked at this desk. So did George Mitchell and a whole host of great \nAmericans. It is remarkable what the history of this institution \npresents and the opportunities it affords. It has been a remarkable \ntime. I think all of you know that.\n  In the last 5 years, it seems as if we have jammed more historic \nmoments in than you could ever imagine, with an unprecedented \nPresidential election in 2000, where we all sat in this Chamber and \nconfirmed the results of that election. We had a 50/50 Senate, and \neverybody was trying to figure out how it worked. And then, with a \nshift of one vote in the caucus, that changed the control of the \nSenate.\n  That dark day on September 11 changed the lives of Americans forever. \nI live in Hoboken, NJ. It looks out almost directly across the river \nwhere the Twin Towers once stood. New Jersey's heart has never fully \nhealed from those losses. It never will. We lost 700 of our citizens. \nWe have much to do, and it has stimulated even the debate we have on \nthis floor today. There were kids who lost their lives on that day whom \nI coached in soccer when they were growing up in my previous hometown \nof Summit. We still have a lot to do.\n  Today, we are challenged with the war against terrorism and debate \nabout our constitutional freedoms, which we are talking about today--\nthe challenge of tradeoffs in security and freedom, and protecting what \nit is that the American Constitution stands for. This is a great \ninstitution for making sure the rights of our people are represented.\n  I came to the Senate to try to use my knowledge and experience to \nhelp work on some of those problems that are most important to our \nNation--health care, economic and racial justice, education--there is a \nwhole series of those things. I am proud of that progressive agenda. I \nsee so many peers and colleagues who fight so hard on those every day.\n  Mr. President, 9/11 brought us together regardless of our political \nbackgrounds in ways we could never have been imagined. I am proud of \nhow our Nation responded and also how the leadership of this great body \ncame together and acted, regardless of background or place, in ways I \ndon't think any of us could have imagined. I am grateful to all of my \ncolleagues for that leadership.\n\n  We also have great people in New Jersey. The Jersey girls, as a lot \nof my colleagues know, have been fighters for making sure we had the 9/\n11 Commission, the compensation fund, responses to human needs, as well \nas the strategic intelligence and homeland security needs that the \nAmerican people deserve. I am proud of them. I am proud of the work we \nhave all done because it encourages us.\n  We provided over $350 million to address New Jersey's unique security \nneeds after the September 11th terrorist attacks.\n  There was an element of unity that I hope we can restore that was \nborn in those moments because the challenges are just as great. The \nimmediacy is a little different, but there is no reason we can't stand \ntogether.\n  I am proud of the opportunity to be a partner with my chairman, \nSenator Sarbanes, Chris Dodd, and others with regard to helping restore \ninvestor confidence that was also broken around that time where people \nlost their life savings, where people in the world I had come from had \ntaken advantage of other human beings' savings, retirement securities, \nand their jobs. It is not a proud moment for those of us who believe in \nthe capitalistic system.\n  With the kind of response that came through the Sarbanes-Oxley bill, \nI think we have actually made a major contribution to making sure that \nbalance sheets and income statements are what they are, that people can \nhave more confidence in our fundamental system. I was honored to be a \npart of the detail and the work that brought that back. We should \nprotect it as we go forward.\n  There is more to do with our pension system. There are many things \nthat are part of our financial structure which is such a fundamental \ndefining element of what America is about. We need to make sure they \nhave the integrity that was built into the theme of the Sarbanes-Oxley \nreforms.\n  I am proud to have represented the Democratic caucus for 2 years in \nthe push back against the privatization of Social Security. We had a \ndebate on the floor where Senator Santorum, Senator Sununu, Senator \nDurbin, and myself, for a remarkable hour and a half, had dialog among \nSenators. All of those elements of debate are still in play. We need to \nmake sure we protect the security of our seniors. I know folks on this \nside of the aisle feel so strongly in winning that battle, and we \nshould continue.\n  There are many others issues: affordable drug benefits, college \ntuition. Senator Kennedy and others have fought so hard to make sure \neverybody has access to the American promise. I am proud that I had a \nrole--an amendment role, a voting role, a sponsorship role--to be a \npart of those agendas. We can do, and have done, a lot to protect our \nenvironment to make quality of life better.\n  Together with my colleagues from New Jersey, we protected people in \nour state from federal changes that would have weakened New Jersey's \nmodel prescription drug program for seniors and people with \ndisabilities.\n  We lifted federal home loans mortgage limits to help more New Jersey \nveterans buy their own homes.\n  We fought the administration's effort to reduce the availability of \nstudent loans. We held them off for a year--long enough to enable many \nstudents to stay in school instead of having to drop out.\n  We preserved the unspoiled beauty and critical water supply in the \nNew Jersey Highlands.\n  And we stopped a plan by the administration that would have paved the \nway for oil and gas drilling off the New Jersey shore. Because America \nneeds a balanced energy plan that invests in conservation and \nalternative energy sources--not oil derricks lining our beaches.\n  In the highway bill that passed this year, we increased New Jersey's \nrate of return on the federal highway tax dollar form 90.5 cents to 92 \ncents. And we paved the way for the New Jersey Trans-Hudson Midtown \nCorridor.\n  There is a lot more to do. I have some challenges that I leave for \nall of my colleagues. Maybe the most important one, and the one I feel \nmost passionately about, is the ongoing challenge to man's inhumanity \nto man in Darfur, Sudan. We have lost 300,000 lives, give or take. \nPeople don't really know the degree to which life has been lost. But we \nneed to make sure that we don't revisit Rwanda and other places where \nwe have turned our backs on the killing of one man and one woman, one \nat a time.\n  There is much to do. I am proud of the efforts that Senator Brownback \nand I have done to make sure this body recognized for the first time \nthat genocide was taking place, that there was much to do, that we had \nsome financing to sponsor the African Union to do that which would \nbring an end to the rape, the killing, and the pillaging that is going \non. There is much more to do. Please, please, make sure, whether it is \nin Darfur or other places, that this body speaks out for humanity, \nsomething I know all of my colleagues carry in their hearts. It is one \nof the great hopes and dreams.\n  I know a number of my colleagues--Senator Obama, Senator Durbin, \nCongressman Payne on the other side of this great Capitol, communities \nof faith, concerned citizens--are really committed to these issues, \nparticularly as it relates to Darfur. But we should stand up, and we \nshould move forward.\n  I have a big hope that my colleagues will take the opportunity to \nmove on chemical plant security, which is something I have hooted and \nhollered about and bored people to death with over the last 4 years. We \nare so close but yet so far and at such risk. Whether it is rail \nsecurity,--and all of us have a number of other issues--it is painful \nfor us to get such low marks in how we have addressed our homeland \nsecurity.\n\n[[Page S13724]]\n\n  Now I go to be a Governor of a State where the primary day-to-day \npractice and responsibility is to protect the lives of the people who \nlive in these communities. I hope we will move forward in an \nexpeditious manner to address some of those items that we all know are \nat great risk.\n  There is a lot of progress to be made in a lot of areas. I could go \non. I am proud of the initiative on kids accounts, which I hope a lot \nof you will get behind. We can change the financial underpinnings and \nknowledge of so many folks. I am proud of this idea. I know there are a \nnumber of my colleagues who are interested in the idea of giving every \nchild who gets a Social Security number a start in life. It is \nimplemented in Great Britain. We ought to do it here. There is a real \nhope it can bring about a different opportunity and potential for every \nperson.\n  And I'm proud of what we've done for financial literacy. It's mind-\nboggling to me that we live in a capitalist society, yet our schools \nprovide students with few, if any, tools about how to navigate the \nsystem. We push our kids out into the world and say ``You're on your \nown. Good luck.'' As more financial risk is shifted onto individuals, \nthe consequences of bad financial decisions grow more dire. That's why \nI pushed to include basic financial literacy in the No Child Left \nBehind Act to teach young people the basic principles of capitalism and \nresponsible money management.\n  I will look to this body to come up with answers on health care, \nMedicare, making sure our children are educated appropriately. The \nagenda is large. There are great disappointments, by the way. I close \nwith a few of those. It is hard for me to imagine when I came here that \nwe were running a couple hundred billion dollars in surpluses, and now \nwe have created debt that is greater in the 5 years than was ever \ncreated in the history of the country. I think we are really in danger \nof going over the precipice on the twin deficits with regard to fiscal \nmanagement of this country. It seems grossly unfair that we are placing \nthat burden on future generations the way we are.\n  I can tell my colleagues, as it ripples down to our State levels, \nthey are going to hear a former Senator hooting and hollering pretty \nhigh about how we are crowding out and crowding in responsibilities \nthat will be very difficult.\n  The fact we haven't raised the minimum wage in the years I have been \nin the Senate is hard to imagine. There is a study out this week that \nif you earn the minimum wage, there is not a county in this country \nwhere someone can afford a one-bedroom apartment. It is time to move on \nsome of these issues.\n  I know I am preaching to the choir, but it is time to move. We ought \nto ban racial profiling. There are a whole host of issues.\n  Since I came to the Senate in 2001, the number of uninsured Americans \nhas swelled to over 45 million people. We have made some important \nstrides in improving access to care for certain populations, but these \npiecemeal attempts to address our health care crisis have fallen far \nshort of providing all Americans with quality, affordable health care. \nI would like to see us come together as a nation to guarantee health \ncare to each and every American.\n  Senator Lautenberg and I would like to see Bruce Springsteen honored, \ntoo. We think we ought to step up and acknowledge both the poetry and \nthe majesty of his fights for the working men and women of this world.\n  I wish to thank my colleagues and the people of New Jersey for this \ngreat opportunity. I leave the Senate with incredible excitement and \noptimism about the future. I am looking forward to my new job in a way \nI cannot even get my mind around half the time because it seems so \nprofoundly interesting and applies to the day-to-day lives of folks.\n  I have no serious regrets. I have sadness about not being able to \nwalk onto this great floor, but I love this place and look forward to \ncoming back and working together on those issues that matter.\n  I close by especially thanking my colleague, Senator Frank \nLautenberg, who has just been a gem to work with, and my leaders, Tom \nDaschle and Harry Reid, who have been extraordinary.\n  Mr. President, I say to all of my colleagues, they have been great.\n  I mentioned Robert Byrd, a giant on this floor.\n  I cannot help but remember the man maybe I admired the most here, \nbecause he had the greatest courage, was Paul Wellstone and his \nincredible fire and commitment to equality and justice in every \npossible way.\n  It has been some run. I want to say thanks to my children, who \nsupported me, Jennifer, Josh, and Jeffery; an incredible staff who have \nworked hard. I have a list of the names of the staff who have served \nthe people of New Jersey with me. I do not think I will read them all, \nbut I ask unanimous consent that they be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n     Current DC and NJ Staff\n       Cynthia Alicea, Renee Ashe, Lucas Ballet, Vicky Beyerle, \n     Elizabeth Brinkerhoff, Alison Brosnan, Sandra Caron George, \n     Jason Cassese, Anthony Coley, Gwendolyn Cook, Deborah Curto, \n     Christopher Donnelly, Karin Elkis, Jennifer Friedberg, \n     Michael Goldblatt, Evan Gottesman, Heather H.

I would not be worth a darn without what they have been \nable to do. I want to say that the staff who works the floor has been \nremarkable. Without Lula Davis' help and people such as Marty and other \nfolks who guide us through how we get things done, none of us would be \nin the same place, as well as the Parliamentarians, the clerks, and \nothers. I am extraordinarily grateful for their support.\n  I would be remiss if I did not mention Jeri Thomson who has been so \ngreat.\n  To all of you and to all of those who go unmentioned but not \nunthought of, let me say thank you. It has been a privilege of a \nlifetime and I look forward to serving the people of the State of New \nJersey and our great country in the years ahead.\n  I yield the floor.\n  (Applause.)\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I wasn't here when Jon Corzine arrived \nin the Senate 5 years ago in fact, he actually took my place at the \ntime. We met to share ideas on an agenda for New Jersey and America and \nI followed his progress closely. I was impressed by what I saw in Jon's \nservice in the Senate, where he has earned respect and affection. Jon \ncame from great success in the world of finance and industry, but he is \nable to communicate with ordinary people, as well.\n  Some people arrive here and immediately head for the headlines. But \nthat isn't Jon Corzine's style. Jon is a committed ``workhorse,'' who \nworks long hours with high intensity. He doesn't have a lot of flash, \nbut he is very effective.\n  He came to Washington for one reason: to serve the people of New \nJersey. Now, with some sorrow on my part, he is leaving us here for the \nsame reason: to help New Jersey even more directly.\n  Even before the terrorist attacks on 9/11, work had been done to \nstrengthen security at our chemical plants. Jon recognized the \nimportance of that issue long before most people, so when he arrived \nhere in the Senate, he took the\n\n[[Page S13725]]\n\nball and ran with it. Jon introduced a plan to overhaul security at \nchemical plants, and many people were surprised when he got it \nunanimously approved in committee. But those who know Jon Corzine \nweren't surprised. Even when that bill was blocked by lobbyists, Jon \ndidn't give up. He has continued to fight to make our chemical plants \nsafer. He has raised awareness of the problem, which I will take up \nonce again, because we are at risk across this Nation from the most \nhorrible devastation to our people and communities.\n  Jon Corzine carried an agenda here that was so appropriate for New \nJersey that he established a place for himself in the history of the \nState even before he becomes Governor.\n  I wasn't a Member of the Senate on that fateful day of September 11, \n2001, when my State lost almost 700 people. But I knew we would have a \nstrong advocate in Jon Corzine. And we did. Jon listened to the \nfamilies who had lost loved ones, and he knew they deserved answers. So \nhe fought to establish the 9/11 Commission. I honestly don't think it \never would have come to pass without his efforts. He has been a great \nally in my fight to make New Jersey and our Nation safer by directing \nhomeland security resources to where they are most needed.\n  By the time I returned to the Senate almost 3 years ago, Jon had \nearned a reputation as a hard worker who cares more about getting \nresults than getting credit. People had learned that when you talk to \nJon Corzine, he really listens. They had learned that he isn't in love \nwith the sound of his own voice. And they had learned that when Jon \nCorzine does speak, he has something to say.\n  Three years ago our Nation was rocked by the Enron scandal, and by \nother incidents that undermined public confidence in the integrity of \nmajor corporations. With his background as the CEO of one of the \nlargest financial services firms in the country, Jon realized the \nimportance of restoring public trust and confidence. Even though he \nworked mostly behind the scenes on the Sarbanes-Oxley bill the most \nfar-reaching corporate reform law since the Great Depression he was \nrecognized by the New York Times as the bill's ``primary architect.''\n  Sarbanes-Oxley improved business accounting standards, helped restore \ninvestor confidence, and protected the savings of millions of \nAmericans. Jon's name isn't on that bill, but his influence is.\n  Jon has been a great teammate for me, working for New Jersey day in \nand day out. He has also worked with many of you, on both sides of the \naisle.\n  I know how hard he has worked with Senator Brownback, for instance, \nto stop genocide in the Darfur region of the Sudan. As a member of the \nForeign Relations Committee, Jon offered the first Senate resolution to \nclassify this horrific situation as ``genocide.'' The passage of this \nbipartisan resolution, coupled with other efforts to increase awareness \nof atrocities in Darfur, prompted then-Secretary of State Colin Powell \nto declare that genocide was in fact occurring. After traveling to \nSudan personally, Senator Corzine championed a successful bipartisan \neffort to provide $75 million for African Union peacekeeping troops. He \nalso introduced a bill establishing sanctions against Sudan, which the \nSenate passed.\n  Jon served in the Marine Corps Reserves, and he understands the \nburdens on our men and women in uniform especially the National Guard \nand Reserves, who have provided so many of the troops in Iraq.\n  After I served in World War II, I went to college on the G.I. bill. \nJon Corzine has worked to update the G.I. bill for the 21st century, to \nmeet rising education costs. He has fought for better health care for \nveterans and military families. And he sponsored a bill that will help \n90,000 vets buy their own homes. For these reasons and many more, the \nVeterans of Foreign Wars gave Jon their Congressional Award in 2004.\n  Over the past 3 years I have been proud to call Jon Corzine my friend \nand my colleague. Today, I am equally proud to call him the next \nGovernor of my home State of New Jersey. I will miss him here in the \nSenate. But I will take comfort in knowing that he will be leading New \nJersey in the right direction. I hope all of my colleagues will join me \ntoday in wishing Senator Corzine a fond farewell and great success in \nthe future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I think the Senator from California had a \nunanimous consent request?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. If I may, and I thank the Senator from Massachusetts, \nI ask unanimous consent that I be recognized when the tributes to \nSenator Corzine have concluded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join my Senate \ncolleagues in paying tribute to Jon Corzine, congratulating him on his \nelection as Governor of New Jersey, and commending him for his skillful \nservice to the people of New Jersey and to the Nation as a Senator.\n  For the past 5 years in the Senate, Senator Corzine has stood up for \nworking families, for affordable health care, for pension security, and \non many other challenges. Again and again, he has demonstrated his \ncommitment to the fundamental principle of fairness--that government \nshould represent the interests of all Americans, regardless of race, \nincome, or disability. It has been an honor to work with him.\n  Jon is committed to helping others achieve the American Dream. He \nbelieves very deeply that through hard work and determination, people \ncan make better lives for themselves and their families. He believes \nthis so deeply, because he has lived it himself.\n  Growing up on a small farm in Illinois, Jon dedicated himself to his \nstudies and graduated from the University of Illinois. He then joined \nthe Marine Corps Reserve and began his impressive career in business \nand banking.\n  His talents helped him rise in the business world too--from a bond \ntrader at Goldman Sachs to chairman and CEO of the firm.\n  Once his hard work and talent helped him reach the pinnacle of his \nprofession, Jon decided to give something back by helping all Americans \nachieve their full potential.\n  When he came to the Senate in 2001, he made an immediate impact, \nbringing the same talents and commitment in the business world to his \nwork for New Jersey and the country.\n  We could all see that Jon was a committed and progressive public \nservant, motivated by a strong sense what's right and what's fair.\n  Not long after he was elected, the Nation faced a sudden challenge of \nmassive corporate fraud, involving Enron, WorldCom, and others. \nFamilies' pensions were lost. Workers' savings went up in smoke because \nof cooked books and insider deals.\n  The administration dragged its feet, but Jon stood up for those \nworkers and sent a clear message to those executives that if they \ndefraud the American people, they must pay.\n  Jon's compassion and invaluable business experience helped persuade \nCongress to pass the most sweeping corporate reforms since the Great \nDepression.\n  He brought that same knowledge of the financial markets and \nsecurities industry and that same sense of fairness to the battle to \nprotect Social Security. When others tried to frighten the American \npeople into undermining the most important social safety net program \nthe Nation has ever had, Jon stood firm, and the so-called reforms were \nnot passed.\n  I was especially impressed by the way Senator Corzine rose to the \nchallenge of 9/11 and rallied the people of New Jersey after the \nterrorist attacks. He was only 9 months into his term, but he stepped \nup and provided real leadership at a time of enormous crisis and \nuncertainty.\n  He did his best to ease the grief of the survivor's families, and he \ndid everything he could to see that the Federal Government lived up to \nits responsibility to provide relief to those families.\n  Month after month, year after year, Jon also insisted that the 9/11 \nCommission get answers to their tough questions, no matter how \nentrenched the opposition.\n  For 5 years, he has been a driving force to improve homeland \nsecurity, by making sure that our Nation's ports receive the resources \nthey need, and by\n\n[[Page S13726]]\n\npressing the administration to protect chemical plants in New Jersey \nand across the Nation.\n  We will miss Jon's leadership and eloquence here in the Senate. The \npeople of New Jersey are fortunate to have him as their new Governor, \nand I know he will continue the outstanding leadership we have all come \nto know and admire. New Jersey is in good hands, and I wish him \ncontinuing success in the years ahead.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following \nmy comments, Senator Stabenow be recognized, then Senator Salazar and \nSenator Reed be recognized. All of us seek to speak about our \ncolleague, Senator Corzine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, in a few weeks our good friend, Jon Corzine, will \nleave the Senate, where he so effectively represented New Jersey and \nits people over the past 5 years, to become Governor of his State. I \nhave been privileged to serve with Senator Corzine on the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, to whose work he has brought an \nextraordinary combination of principle, vision, intelligence, and solid \ncommon sense. I wish to say a few words today about his spectacular \nwork on that committee. For a while, I was privileged to serve as \nchairman of the committee, and I can tell you that no chairman could \nhave a better fate than to have Jon Corzine as one of his members.\n  Prior to entering the U.S. Senate, Jon Corzine spent nearly a quarter \nof a century with Goldman Sachs, the New York investment bank, \nincluding five as its chairman and CEO. His long and wide-ranging \nexperience in the financial markets made him especially well qualified \nto deal with the issues that came within the Banking Committee's \njurisdiction. In very short order, it was apparent that whenever Jon \nCorzine's turn in a committee meeting came to put questions to \nwitnesses, even the most confident and sophisticated among them \nlistened more intently and responded more carefully.\n  Senator Corzine's contribution to the accounting reform and investor \nprotection legislation known as Sarbanes-Oxley was invaluable. Along \nwith Senator Dodd, who also serves on the committee, Jon Corzine was \namong the first members of the Senate to call for hearings on investor \nprotection in the wake of the collapse of Enron Corporation. Those \nhearings took place in February and March of 2002, and Senator Corzine, \nalong with others on the committee, Senator Dodd and others, played a \ncritical role in shaping the reform legislation enacted 4 months later. \nI have done it before and I wish to again acknowledge the very \nsubstantial and significant contributions Jon Corzine made in helping \nto shape and develop that legislation. His work was invaluable.\n  Consistently in the work of the committee, Jon Corzine played a \ncritical role in efforts to strengthen protections for investors in our \ncapital markets. BusinessWeek, in fact, noted that his work in this \narea gave him ``an unusually high profile for a junior Senator.''\n  His contributions to the work of the committee were by no means \nfocused only on these issues. Indeed, he touched virtually every issue \nin the committee's jurisdiction. He has worked vigorously to expand \nhousing opportunities and the effectiveness of Federal housing \nprograms. He has been a forceful spokesman for full funding for \ncritical programs of the Department of Housing and Urban Development--\nsection 8 vouchers, housing for the elderly, improved public housing, \nand other efforts to assist low-income homeowners and renters. It is \nindicative of his commitment, and in his statement here in the Chamber \nonly a few minutes ago he again was making reference to how people who \nwork at minimum wage can't afford an apartment in county after county \nacross the country.\n  He led efforts to expand coverage of FHA insurance for multifamily \nhousing, something especially relevant in States such as New Jersey \nwhere inflated housing costs affected previous program ceilings. He \npressed for energy efficiency requirements in public and assisted \nhousing, and he has remained committed to Federal action to assure \nsecondary mortgage market liquidity and affordable housing.\n  Jon Corzine was an original cosponsor of the legislation to stop \npredatory lending practices and spoke forcefully in the committee's \ndeliberation about the harsh and cynical techniques predatory lenders \nused to exploit vulnerable borrowers seeking mortgages and other \ncredit. He has been one of the leaders in the Senate in the fight \nagainst Federal preemption of State consumer protection laws which are \ndesigned to protect our citizens against these practices.\n  He has been among the Senate's most outspoken advocates for public \nand private financial literacy programs to ensure that all Americans of \nall ages and all backgrounds have the skills to grasp the financial \nimplications of the often complex credit card loans and other financial \narrangements they are offered.\n  He has obtained Federal funding for financial education programs in \nelementary and secondary schools and was the leader in the ultimately \nsuccessful efforts in 2003 to pass the Financial Literacy and Education \nImprovement Act, which incorporates many of his ideas. For his work on \nthis issue, the JumpStart Coalition for Personal Financial Literacy \nnamed him ``Federal Financial Literacy and Education Legislator of the \nYear.''\n  Throughout his tenure, Senator Corzine has been among our most \narticulate advocates for public transportation, whose importance in the \nday-to-day lives of his constituents he knows firsthand since he \nrepresents the most densely populated State in the Nation. He fought to \npreserve and enhance the Federal transit program as the new surface \ntransportation authorization legislation was developed. As a result of \nhis efforts, New Jersey will receive nearly $2.5 billion in transit \nformula funds from 2004 through 2009, a 50-percent increase over the \namount the State received in the predecessor legislation.\n\n  He also succeeded in assuring priority treatment in terms of \nplanning, funding, and execution under this new legislation for a new \ncommuter rail tunnel under the Hudson River. This project, the Trans-\nHudson Midtown Corridor, has been identified as a crucial investment \nfor the region's mobility and security. As a result of his efforts, the \nNational Transit Institute, which provides training, education, and \nclearinghouse services to support public transportation, will be \nmaintained at Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey.\n  Senator Corzine was a leader in the effort to develop a Federal \nbackstop for terrorism insurance after the attacks of September 11, \n2001. Those attacks left such insurance widely unavailable and put \nbusinesses and commercial property owners at risk of future losses from \nterrorism without having insurance coverage. He recognized immediately \nthis situation would create a drag on economic activity and again \nbrought his expertise to bear in helping to develop the Federal \nlegislation under which the Federal Government would share the risk of \nfuture terrorism losses with the industry.\n  Senator Corzine was one of the first to recognize the threat that \nidentity theft poses both to consumers and to the integrity of the \nNation's payment system. He has been a leader in the fight for \nsafeguards on personal information, on protecting the privacy of our \ncitizens.\n  Many of these things I have spoken about reflect a common theme, and \nthat is Jon Corzine's concern for those left out and left behind. It \nhas been a hallmark of his service in the Senate that he has sought to \nbring into the mainstream of American life those who have been left out \nof it. This concern for those, in a sense, who have been forgotten, was \nreflected in his work in the international arena, particularly the \nemphasis he placed on the situation in Darfur. Again and again, Jon \nCorzine took the floor of the Senate to bring to our attention the \nterrible things that were happening there and to push for measures to \nhelp alleviate that situation.\n  Finally, let me say what has distinguished Senator Corzine's service \nin the Senate over and above his many specific accomplishments is the \ndedication and vision and principles that underlie all his work. Before \ncoming to\n\n[[Page S13727]]\n\nthe Senate, he spent much of his professional life as an investment \nbanker. But he brought to his responsibilities certain fundamental \nconvictions about the nature of American society, a hopeful and \noptimistic vision of American life that first took place as he was \ngrowing up in a small farming community in central Illinois. It was \nthere he has said he learned ``the meaning of hard work and the \nopportunities afforded by a strong education system.''\n  Jon Corzine went on to earn his B.A. as Phi Beta Kappa at the \nUniversity of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and enlisted in the Marine \nCorps Reserve where he served for 6 years. He attended the University \nof Chicago Business School at night, and not too much later he joined \nGoldman Sachs.\n  His many years in the financial markets have not dimmed Jon Corzine's \nvision of America as a nation grounded in opportunity--opportunity for \na good education, for a decent job, a place to raise one's family and \nsomeday to retire with dignity, security, and self-respect. He has \ndedicated his efforts to advance programs that can make this vision a \nreality for all his fellow Americans.\n  When he announced his candidacy for Governor of New Jersey last \nDecember, Senator Corzine pledged he would ``fight like crazy to make \nsure that there is a view that government can be a partner in lifting \nup the lives of the rest of America.'' This is surely what he has done \nin the Senate.\n  In just 5 short years, notwithstanding his junior status in a body \nthat sets a high premium on seniority--when I first came here I was \nvery critical of the seniority system, but I have to admit that as time \nhas gone by I have come to see the virtues of the system. Jon Corzine \nhas had an impressive record of accomplishment. He has demonstrated the \nastute and principled leadership in the Senate that will most assuredly \nmake him a distinguished Governor of the State of New Jersey in the \nservice of all its people.\n  If I may be so bold as to address a word to the people of New Jersey, \nI simply say they have an extraordinary leader about to take over as \nthe Governor of their State. I urge them to give Jon Corzine their \nbacking and support so he can bring his vision to bear in the State of \nNew Jersey.\n  When Woodrow Wilson became Governor of the State of New Jersey, he \nintroduced a progressive agenda which became the model for the Nation. \nNew Jersey went to the very forefront of the 50 States in addressing \nfairness and opportunity for its citizens and enhancing their quality \nof life. I say today, as we bid our dear colleague a fond farewell, Jon \nCorzine can provide that kind of leadership for New Jersey. He can move \nthat State to the very forefront of the 50 States and make it a shining \nexample of what can be accomplished when all of us pull together in \norder to enhance opportunity for each and every one. I wish him the \nvery best as he leaves this body and in the years ahead.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \nhonoring a man I have come to know as a colleague, a dedicated public \nservant, and a friend.\n\n  Jon Corzine is a shining example of the American dream--of what one \ncan accomplish with hard work and the opportunity to obtain a good \neducation.\n  Growing up in rural Illinois as the son of a corn and soybean farmer \nand a public school teacher, Jon Corzine learned early in life the \nimportance of family, responsibility and service to his community.\n  These are the values that led him to serve his country as a member of \nthe U.S. Marine Corps Reserves--and over the years, his strong values \nhave guided his career in both in private industry and public service.\n  Jon Corzine started his career on the ground floor of American \nbusiness. And even as he worked hard and achieved extraordinary \nsuccess, he never lost sight of his values.\n  When he served as chairman and chief executive officer of Goldman \nSachs, he led that company from a private partnership to a public \noffering. At the same time, expanded the company's philanthropic \noutreach efforts to better serve people in need.\n  He continued that important work here in the U.S. Senate, where he \nused his political power to fight for people without political \ninfluence. For the last 5 years, he has been a tireless advocate or \nveterans, seniors, students, women, children and families in New Jersey \nand across our Nation.\n  Senator Corzine and I were sworn into the Senate on the same day--and \nI served with him on both the Budget Committee and the Banking, Housing \nand Urban Affairs Committee. There, we worked together to preserve \nfunding for programs that help our Nation's most vulnerable citizens--\nprograms such as Medicare and Medicaid, veterans health care, and \neducation.\n  We also worked together to lead the fight to keep the security in \nSocial Security.\n  His business expertise made him a strong advocate for fiscal \nresponsibility. He fought to get the national debt under control so we \ncould preserve and create opportunities for our Nation's young people--\nrather than saddle them with the burden of our government's debts.\n  He has lived the American dream and continues to work hard to ensure \nthat others have a chance to live it too.\n  Jon Corzine is a thoughtful, hard-working man who worked with his \ncolleagues from both sides of the political spectrum to do the right \nthing for the people of New Jersey and this Nation.\n  I am honored to have him as a friend and a colleague--and I wish him \nwell in his new role as Governor of New Jersey.\n  I add my comments, along with my friends and colleagues in the \nSenate, for someone who has become a personal friend, as well as \nsomeone I admire greatly and that we are going to greatly miss. New \nJersey is very lucky to have Jon Corzine coming in as Governor of that \ngreat State.\n  Senator Corzine and I have worked together both on the Committee on \nthe Budget and on the Committee on Banking. I can say it is true what \nSenator Sarbanes said, that even though he sat at the end of the table \nat the Committee on Banking and we were squeezed in with our staff \ntrying to make sure we did not fall off the end of the platform, I \nalways knew when the person at the end was about to speak and ask his \nquestions, there was going to be silence in the room and tremendous \nrespect for what he was going to say and concern about whether they \nwould be able to effectively answer his questions, as the witnesses \nwere answering various questions concerning finances.\n  To watch Senator Corzine work has been to watch an example of what we \nwant in public service. To see someone who grew up in a small town--\nlike I did in Michigan--growing up in a small town, serve his country \nin the Marines, as so many of my colleagues have. I am particularly \nproud of the people on the Democrat side of the aisle who have served \nin public service as it relates to our Armed Services and continue to \nbring that perspective and support today.\n  But certainly Senator Corzine is one of them. And to go on to be so \nincredibly successful in business, and then to bring that expertise \nhere on behalf of the people of New Jersey to work with all of us I \nthink is an example of a tremendously great American success story. I \nam proud to have worked with Senator Corzine and look forward to \nworking with him as the Governor of New Jersey.\n  I will simply echo my colleagues in saying, when we talk about \ncorporate responsibility and accountability, Senator Corzine and his \nexpertise has been there. Housing, public transit, homeland security, \nhis passion for Social Security, addressing so many different issues \nthat are important to people, important to communities, important to \nour democracy, have had the voice of Jon Corzine.\n  So I congratulate you on your service. I congratulate the people of \nNew Jersey on the public service that is to come. And, mostly, I thank \nJon Corzine for his generosity of heart and for his willingness to \ninvest in so many ways to better the community with his own resources. \nThis is someone who has been incredibly generous and caring and smart \nand compassionate and dedicated to the right values that we all care \nabout deeply.\n  I know he is going to do an outstanding job as Governor and that we \nwill all be better off for his public service.\n\n[[Page S13728]]\n\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I stand here today to not only say thank \nyou but to congratulate the Senator from New Jersey, the Governor-elect \nof New Jersey, Jon Corzine.\n  For me, my whole life has been touched by many people who have helped \nme live the American dream. But it is an American dream, too, that has \ncome with challenges in dealing with the issues of poverty and in \ndealing with the issues of racism.\n  There was a time in my life when I thought anything was possible for \nanyone in America. There was also a time in my life when I thought \nthere were limitations placed on myself personally that I could never \novercome because of the history of racism and the effects of poverty \nwithin my own life.\n  Notwithstanding the fact that I was a proud son of that great \ngeneration of World War II, soldiers who fought in World War II, and \nsteeped in the history of New Mexico and southern Colorado, there were \nmany people who, when I decided to seek this position in the Senate, \nthought that it could not be done. There were many people who brought \nup reason after reason why this was not a place where I could serve.\n  One of the people who disagreed with those conclusions was Jon \nCorzine. Jon Corzine told me that, yes, it was possible to still \nbelieve in the American dream, that no matter what your background is \nand no matter what your economic circumstance might be, everything is \nstill possible here in America. His inspiration and his vision and his \nleadership contributed to my serving today in the Senate.\n  When I characterize my friendship with Jon Corzine and look at him as \na person and as a leader, the words that come to my mind are ``an \nauthentic leader.'' He is who he is. He is a very successful \nbusinessperson, but he is the kind of person whom we ought to have in \nthe Senate all of the time; that is, people who care about our Nation \nand the people whom we represent here every day. He has put them and \nour Nation ahead of his own self-interest. That is the legacy that we \nnow pass on to New Jersey, the legacy that New Jersey has grabbed for \nitself, as they take him as the next Governor of New Jersey.\n  I know he will continue to do great things in New Jersey as the \nGovernor of that State, in the same way he has done great things in the \nSenate--those things my colleagues have spoken about on the floor of \nthe Senate today.\n  I wish him well, and I know his continued leadership is something we \nwill continue to see in the days and years ahead.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, it is a privilege to be here today to say a \nfew words about my colleague and friend, Jon Corzine. He has honored \nthis Senate and he has honored the people of New Jersey with his \nservice.\n  I did not know Jon before he came here. I heard about his campaign. I \nheard about his success on Wall Street. I, frankly, must confess, I did \nnot know what quite to expect. Having seen the movie ``Wall Street,'' I \nalmost thought that Michael Douglas would walk in the door in a $3,000 \nsuit and with expensive accoutrements.\n  Jon surprised us all because he is not like that. He might have found \nhis success on Wall Street, but his values were formed in the heartland \nof America and in the U.S. Marine Corps. He believes very deeply in \nvalues that are important and central to our party and to the people of \nthis country: the notion of opportunity for all and the notion that \nthis is a community, not just a collection of individuals.\n  His service in this body has exemplified those values and made us all \nextraordinarily proud. I served with Jon on the Senate Banking \nCommittee. As the chairman and ranking member at various times of the \nHousing and Transportation Subcommittee, I was familiar with all of \nJon's efforts in making real progress on issues of importance to the \npeople of New Jersey and the people of this country.\n  My friend and colleague, Senator Sarbanes, has pointed out some of \nthese, and I would like to, for the Record, amplify again what Jon has \ndone.\n  The Federal Housing Administration Multifamily Housing Program \nprovides insurance to those seeking to build multifamily rental \nhousing. The program has played a critical role in the development of \naffordable multifamily rental housing. However, as the cost of building \nnew housing has dramatically increased in recent years, Federal \nmultifamily mortgage insurance loan limits have failed to keep pace \nwith inflation.\n  In 2002, Senator Corzine led the way to secure passage of a provision \nto raise FHA multifamily loan limits by indexing them to the annual \nconstruction cost index to ensure that the program keeps pace with \ninflation.\n  In 2003, Senator Corzine further improved the FHA multifamily loan \nprogram by securing passage of legislation to boost those limits in \nhigh-cost communities around the country.\n  Specifically, his legislation raised the loan limits in high-cost \nareas to 140 percent of the statutory base limit and by 170 percent on \na project-by-project basis.\n  These increases have been vitally important in the construction and \nrehabilitation of affordable rental housing in high-cost States such as \nNew Jersey and my own State of Rhode Island where the shortage of \naffordable housing has become a crisis.\n  Jon recognizes that at the heart of every family's efforts to educate \ntheir children, to find work, to hold work, is the need for safe and \naffordable housing. Senator Corzine has been on the vanguard of that \neffort. I salute him for that.\n  He has also been particularly concerned about housing for veterans. \nThe Veterans' Administration Home Loan Program provides access to home \nfinancing for veterans who often, because of their time spent serving \nour Nation, have not had the opportunity to build up the credit they \nneed to qualify for a conventional mortgage. Senator Corzine's \nlegislation to increase veterans' home purchasing power, which became \nlaw as part of the Veterans Benefits Improvement Act of 2004, raised \nthe loan limits available under the VA Home Loan Program to allow \nveterans to obtain mortgages of up to $333,700, the same level \navailable in the traditional mortgage market.\n  Finally, the Senator from New Jersey has been a fierce advocate for \nmass transit funding, not in his home State of New Jersey but across \nthis country. He has been particularly effective, though, in helping \nhis home State.\n  Senator Corzine was instrumental in providing legislation to help \nbuild a commuter rail tunnel under the Hudson River as part of the \nrecently passed Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation \nEquity Act: A Legacy for Users. The language that Senator Corzine \nincluded will expedite the proposed rail tunnel under the Hudson River \nand require the Federal Transit Administration to sign a Full Funding \nGrant Agreement with New Jersey Transit that will provide the Federal \nfunding needed to complete the tunnel, and in so doing not only will he \nassist the people of New Jersey, but he will assist the economy of this \nNation, since so much is dependent upon transit access through New \nJersey to the Eastern Seaboard, Boston, New York and down to \nWashington.\n  We all are going to miss Senator Corzine immensely in the Senate, but \nhe is going forth now to a mission that is equally important; that is, \nto serve the people of New Jersey as their Governor. I know he will be \nsuccessful. And I know those values of opportunity and community and \nfairness and tolerance and decency that exemplified his service in the \nSenate will mark him as a remarkable Governor for the State of New \nJersey.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, knowing Jon Corzine as I think I do, if he \nhad known he was going to have to sit through all these speeches after \nhe spoke, he would have come down here a lot later at night, I suspect, \nor certainly waited until we got out of town, because that is the \nnature of this Senator, Governor to be.\n  I have listened to my colleagues and I listened to his speech. He \nleft us with some important warnings, some important pleas, which I \nhope colleagues will take seriously. I would incorporate\n\n[[Page S13729]]\n\ninto my comments about Jon all of the things Senator Sarbanes said. \nThey were a wonderful summary of what he did and how he did it, his \naccomplishments.\n  He did veterans, and he has been a passionate advocate for public \ntransportation. He was instrumental in housing. These are the sorts of \nsignal accomplishments you can measure, which he can point to and \ncolleagues have, that define the few years he has been here.\n  I say a word or two about the things that helped push him in the \ndirection of accomplishing those goals. What has always struck me about \nJon Corzine and the thing that has been singled out in a number of \ncomments made by my colleagues is the quality of the person, almost an \nimprobable quality when you measure it against the profession he chose \nfor so many years.\n  Maybe a comment about Wall Street, certainly a comment that I know \nJon Corzine would articulate any number of different times in different \nways, that we don't think of people traditionally, with the obvious \nexceptions, a Bob Rubin, some others. Jon Corzine always kept, No. 1, a \ngreat sense of idealism; No. 2, a very strong moral compass that led \nhim to always distinguish between right and wrong; and, No. 3, an \nintegrity about the approach to public life that willingly disclosed \ngreat wealth, willingly submitted himself to unbelievable attacks in \norder to pursue a greater good. Most people would shy away from that \ntoday. When you talk to people in the private sector today about \nrunning for office, they are quick to say: Do that? Why would I want to \ndo that? Why would I want to subject myself to that? Why would I want \nto put myself through that scrutiny?\n  Jon Corzine has always been driven by his sense that there is too \nmuch missing in governance today, that there is a bigger purpose than \nall of us individually, a noble purpose in what we are trying to \nachieve. He believes unabashedly that Government can be part of the \nsolution, that Government actually helps people. And unlike so much of \nthe rhetoric of the last years that has attacked everything Government \ndoes until you have a Katrina, when you understand why you need it, or \nuntil you see the potholes in the streets and the bridges falling apart \nand you begrudgingly acknowledge you need it, Jon always believes you \nneed it proactively. He understands the good it can do.\n  Every one of us who has had the privilege of being here for awhile \nwas impressed by that passion and moral compass he brought to some of \nthe issues. When business people in America were abusing their trust, \nJon brought this extraordinary credibility to that debate. There are \nhuge provisions, as Senator Sarbanes will tell us, and a great deal of \nguidance through that process that came from this freshman Senator.\n  Likewise, with respect to Darfur, an issue where the country ought to \nbe providing a sense of moral outrage, Jon doggedly and tenaciously \npursued that issue without grandstanding, without trying to do it in a \nway that was sort of hit and run. He stayed at it and got the Senate \nultimately to take some measures, though never what we ought to be \ndoing, and the country has yet to do what he knows and understands we \nought to be doing.\n  He always has had a sense of right and wrong. The minimum wage, the \nincomprehensibility of us being a country where people can live out \nwork values and you can't live, and his sense of injustice at giving a \ntax cut to people such as him who have been blessed with the fruits of \ngreat wealth, who understand that there is a different set of \npriorities, a sense of outrage that we would be cutting children off of \nMedicaid, and so on down the list.\n  I am thrilled, and I know when I was privileged to be in New Jersey, \nI could feel it in the people of New Jersey who obviously were \ninundated with an onslaught of confusing and reprehensible kinds of \nclaims in the context of a campaign, which we have seen too much of, \nbut he plowed through that, because of that idealism and his sense of \npurpose for the State. Those folks are anticipating the same kind of \nexcitement that he said in his comments he will bring to this new \nchallenge.\n  The people of New Jersey have chosen wisely. They are going to have a \nleader who will do exactly what Senator Sarbanes talked about. He has \nthe opportunity to make that State one of the great laboratories in the \ncountry, to do what we are unsuccessful and unwilling to do too often \nat this moment in our history here in Washington. I almost envy him \nthat opportunity to grab the executive reins and go out and do it. He \nis going to be an exceptional Governor. He is going to continue to have \nan impact on what Congress chooses to do because of those priorities \nthat he sets in the State.\n  There is no question in my mind that our caucus, which has looked to \nhim regularly as sort of the resident expert on issues of fiscal, \ntrade, Wall Street matters, is going to miss that expertise enormously.\n  I thank this Senator for his service to us, to the country, and we \nlook forward to the service he will provide as Governor of New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to wish Senator Jon Corzine the \nvery best as he goes from service in this body to become the next \nGovernor of the State of New Jersey. I have had the privilege of \nserving with Senator Corzine on the Budget Committee. He has been a \nvalued member of that committee. He has made an extraordinary \ncontribution there, always thoughtful and well informed. Senator \nCorzine is deeply respected by colleagues on both sides. It is fair to \nsay that no one on the Senate Budget Committee and no one in this \nChamber has a better understanding of financial markets or economic \nissues than Senator Jon Corzine.\n  On the Budget Committee, Senator Corzine has warned repeatedly of the \nrisks of exploding deficits and debt. As someone who has been \nextraordinarily successful in the private sector, and as someone who \nhas displayed in the real world a profound understanding of what moves \nmarkets, Senator Corzine words have weight, especially when he says to \nthe members on the committee and here on the Senate floor that we are \nrunning unacceptable risks as we run up the deficit and debt of the \nUnited States. Senator Corzine has time after time alerted us to the \nrisks to the economy of higher interest rates as a result of burgeoning \ndeficits and debt.\n  Senator Corzine has told this body and told the country that it is \nunsustainable to double the foreign holdings of our debt in 5 years. It \nis remarkable and terribly unfortunate that in 5 years, we have taken \nthe external debt of the United States, which was $1 trillion 5 years \nago, to $2 trillion today.\n  Mr. President, it took, as Senator Corzine has pointed out, 224 years \nto run up a trillion dollars of external debt, and that amount has been \nexceeded in the last 5 years. Senator Corzine has said consistently and \nfirmly that these are risks that are being run that have the potential \nto lead to a dramatic increase in interest rates, which would have \nnegative consequences--extremely negative consequences for the American \neconomy. It would threaten economic growth, and has the potential to \nput us into recession.\n  Mr. President, we have been fortunate to have someone of Jon \nCorzine's character and wisdom serving with us in the Senate. I am \ngoing to miss Senator Corzine very much. He has been such a strong \nmember of the Budget Committee--someone to whom we could look for \nexpertise that is highly regarded by all Members of this Chamber.\n  I know Jon Corzine will do a remarkable job as Governor of the State \nof New Jersey. As he leaves here, we wish him well. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I also want to join with my colleagues in \npaying tribute to our departing Senator from New Jersey, Senator Jon \nCorzine. I met him for the first time when we were both sworn in on \nJanuary 3 of 2001.\n  Even before that time, I knew of his success but also his high \ncaliber by virtue of the fact that he was cochairman of a great firm, \nGoldman Sachs, whose previous contributions to the U.S. Government \nincluded John Whitehead, Deputy Secretary of State under President \nReagan, and Robert Rubin, the Secretary of the Treasury under President \nClinton. Senator Corzine followed in that tradition of very successful\n\n[[Page S13730]]\n\nmen who could do anything they wanted with their lives for the rest of \ntheir lives but had chosen to commit themselves to public service.\n  It has been an honor and a privilege and a pleasure to serve with \nSenator Corzine these last 5 years, to learn from his own wisdom and \nexperience as it relates to so many matters affecting the betterment of \nour country, and then to watch him forego what would have been a safe \ntrack and a relatively easy reelection next year as a Senator because \nhe felt he could be of better service to his fellow citizens from New \nJersey by acting as their Governor, going through the rigors and \nordeals of another campaign, a challenging endeavor but where he \nsacrificed himself and his own resources in order to give greater \nservice to the people of New Jersey.\n  Our loss in the Senate with his departure will be a gain for his \nfellow citizens from that State as he devotes full time in New Jersey \nto their better interests. I wish him well. We will miss him. He will \ncarry out even further the great talents he has and his ability to \nimprove his State and our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, when the Senate returns in January, we \nunfortunately will be without one of the finest Senators in this body. \nSenator Jon Corzine will be moving to New Jersey to serve as its \nGovernor. I want to publicly congratulate Senator Corzine on an \nimpressive victory, and congratulate the people of New Jersey for \nmaking an outstanding choice. Their gain is the Senate's loss.\n  Jon Corzine has been an exceptional Senator largely because he is an \nexceptional person. It didn't take Senator Corzine long to demonstrate \nto his colleagues his intelligence and his impressive knowledge of a \nbroad range of political and economic issues. But perhaps even more \nimportant, he quickly convinced members on both sides of the aisle that \nhe possessed a genuine decency and humility.\n  Jon Corzine surely has one of the most impressive resumes of any \nAmerican anywhere. He has a remarkable record of accomplishment, both \nin business and public service. But success never went to his head. And \nif you are fortunate enough to meet him--no matter who you are or what \nyour place in society--you can be sure that Senator Corzine will treat \nyou with respect. He is sincere. He listens. And he's humble. Its \nalmost impossible not to like Jon Corzine.\n  When Senator Corzine came to Washington just 5 years ago, it didn't \ntake him long to earn both the admiration and the affection of his \ncolleagues. But he wasn't just a nice, smart guy. He also worked on \nbehalf of the citizens of New Jersey and the Nation like there was no \ntomorrow. And it didn't take long for him to make his mark.\n  Soon after coming to the Senate, Senator Corzine played a critical \nrole in efforts to respond to widespread abuses at corporations like \nEnron. At the time, Congress needed someone who understood corporate \nAmerica and who could help find balanced solutions that made sense. Jon \nCorzine stepped to the plate and helped develop one of the most \nimportant corporate reforms in American history. That legislation, \nknown as Sarbanes-Oxley, may not bear his name, but it surely bears his \nmark, and all Americans owe him a great debt of gratitude for his \ncontribution.\n  Senator Corzine's economic expertise also helped him become a real \nleader on budget and fiscal issues. Since coming to office, he has been \nan outspoken advocate for fiscal responsibility and a leading defender \nof Social Security. In the last Congress, he headed the Senate \nDemocratic Task Force on Social Security, where he developed the case \nagainst privatization long before the issue was in the headlines. \nDemocrats stopped the administration's misguided attempt to privatize \nSocial Security dead in its tracks this year. Senator Corzine's efforts \nlast year laid the groundwork for much of what we were able to \naccomplish.\n  Senator Corzine also has taken up another important cause that still \nfails to attract sufficient attention: the genocide in Darfur. After \nprior mass murders abroad, such as the one in Rwanda, many Americans \nlooked back with regret at our Nation's failure to act. Yet today, in \nthe midst of another terrible genocide, the U.S. response is again \nwoefully and tragically inadequate. Jon Corzine has personally gone to \nDarfur and has worked hard to focus the Nation's attention on this \ncrisis. It has been a thankless task with no apparent political \nbenefits. For his willingness to pursue this moral cause, he deserves \nreal credit from every American. It will be incumbent on all of us to \nremain focused on this terrible tragedy after he leaves.\n\n  Another cause of great importance on which Senator Corzine has taken \nthe lead is the effort to prevent terrorism at chemical plants. As \nSenator Corzine has told us repeatedly, there are more than 100 \nchemical facilities around our Nation where a terrorist attack could \nendanger more than a million people. Unfortunately, security at too \nmany of our plants is grossly inadequate. Senator Corzine recognized \nthe importance of addressing these security risks now before a \ncatastrophe occurs. Each of us has a responsibility to push forward on \nthis issue he has pushed so tirelessly.\n  I could go on about the many other issues on which Senator Corzine \nhas taken a lead from protecting prescription drug benefits of New \nJersey seniors to promoting financial literacy to preserving our \nenvironment, blocking cuts in student aid and protecting workers \nagainst unsafe conditions. In his relatively short time in the Senate, \nSenator Corzine has been one of our most active Senators and he has had \nan impact on a surprisingly broad range of issues.\n  I also want to take a moment on behalf of the Senate Democratic \ncaucus to publicly thank Senator Corzine for his work in the last \nCongress as head of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. \nSenator Corzine had a tough Job and was dealt a tough hand. But he \nworked extremely hard, as he always does, and he did an excellent job.\n  Let me also express my appreciation to Senator Corzine for selecting \nan outstanding member of Congress to replace him. While we will miss \nSenator Corzine greatly, Bob Menendez is going to be an excellent \nSenator for New Jersey. It is a credit to Senator Corzine to have \nchosen such a talented and committed public servant, who I am confident \nwill not only represent New Jersey well but will also help this body \nbetter represent the great diversity of our Nation.\n  Now Senator Corzine moves from Washington to Trenton, where he will \ntake on some very difficult challenges. But, nobody should ever \nunderestimate Jon Corzine. The people of New Jersey have selected a man \nwho not only has extraordinary talent but someone who always give it \neverything he has. I know he will serve them well and I know at the end \nof the day, he will remain what he is today: a kind, humble, and \nprincipled person who represents the very best of our Nation.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I just left a small farewell party for my \ncolleague, Jon Corzine of New Jersey. He is, of course, leaving the \nSenate in a few days to become Governor of the State of New Jersey. \nCongressman Bob Menendez will be appointed to fill his vacancy and \nstand for election in about a year.\n  I am going to miss Jon Corzine for a lot of reasons. First, we have a \nlot in common. Jon was born and raised in the small town of Willy \nStation, which is just a few miles away from the bustling metropolis of \nTaylorville in Christian County, IL, just a few miles from where I \nlive. I know a little about the Corzine family today, and I sense what \nhis upbringing was all about. He grew up on a farm, with a dad who \nraised corn and soybeans. It was not a comfortable and wealthy \nexistence, but it was a great upbringing. He was raised in the \nMidwestern tradition of working hard. He started at age 13 with his \nfirst job. He worked his way through college, going to the University \nof Illinois where he was a walk-on on the basketball team. He has \nassured me time and again he was no superstar. But the fact that he did \nthat and served in the Marine Corps and went on to the University of \nChicago for a master's degree in business tells me he is a person who \nhad a good work ethic--not only that but a great deal of talent.\n  Jon's career took him to the highest levels in the business world. He \nwas a partner at Goldman Sachs at the age of 33. He was cochair and co-\nCEO of that investment banking giant at the age of 50. He started there \nfetching coffee for\n\n[[Page S13731]]\n\nhis superiors. He came up not only quickly but the right way. When he \nwas first running, I remember reading accounts in the New York Times \nabout what kind of a CEO he was. He knew the elevator operator's name, \nand he would go to the mailroom and talk to the workers there and try \nto provide financial assistance so that workers could go on to earn a \ncollege degree.\n  That is the same Jon Corzine I came to know in the Senate, a very \ncaring and compassionate individual in so many different ways. He would \nfight tooth and nail for things he believed in, and he would also pick \ncauses that were not quite that popular and put all of his energy and \nskill at work on them as well.\n  I can recall the terrible genocide in Dafur and how he made that his \nissue. Time and again, he came to the floor of the Senate to remind all \nof us about that tiny country on the other side of the world and the \npeople being oppressed there. That is Jon Corzine. Time and again, he \nshowed us that you could be both financially successful in life and not \nlose your bearings when it came to good moral conduct and good values.\n  When I think about his heroes in life, I share many of them. He used \nto talk about Paul Douglas, the first man I worked for in the Senate as \na college intern. Paul Douglas was from the University of Chicago \nfaculty, and he was a person who inspired many of us, not only because \nhe worked hard and did his best to speak for the common man, but \nbecause he was all over the State appreciating the variety of life you \ncan find in Illinois. Then, of course, was his successor and protege, \nPaul Simon, whom I was honored to succeed in the Senate, also a friend \nof Jon Corzine's. So we had the Paul Douglas and Paul Simon connection. \nAnd, of course, the admiration Jon Corzine had for them said it all.\n  When I look back at these heroes of Jon Corzine, I realize that we \nhave that much in common--our Illinois roots and a lot more. We come \nfrom the same place. We share many of the same values. We fought on the \nsame side of many of the same battles. We share many of the same \nheroes. Like Jon Corzine, I admired Senators Douglas and Simon. I had \nthe privilege to know and work with them. Paul Douglas helped design \nSocial Security. Jon Corzine helped to save it. Like Paul Douglas, Jon \nCorzine is a brave champion of civil rights, economic justice, and the \nenvironment. Like Paul Douglas, Jon Corzine is unafraid to speak his \nmind for the good of the country.\n  All in all, I am certain that Paul Douglas and Paul Simon would \napprove of the short, though important, Senate career of Jon Corzine. \nThey would thank him, as we all do, for fighting hard and well for \npeople and values of this great Nation. I will miss Jon Corzine. The \npeople of New Jersey have made a wise choice. He will be a good, \nthoughtful, compassionate leader of their great State. I look forward \nto working with him for many years to come for the values that we \nshare.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I want to share my thoughts about Jon \nCorzine. He had a great record at Goldman Sachs. I didn't really know \nhe was a farm boy. That is something Senator Durbin added to the mix. I \nthink I had heard that but had forgotten it. He was successful in the \nfinancial world in an extraordinary way. He was a marine. Of course, \nevery marine I have known has been shaped by that, and I believe \nSenator Zell Miller wrote a book saying that everything he ever needed \nto know he learned in the Marine Corps, or something to that effect.\n  Jon Corzine has been an active Member of the Senate. I remember the \ntime we spent together in Montgomery, AL, on a civil rights trip. We \nwere at the church that Martin Luther King preached in on Dexter \nAvenue, the Dexter Avenue Church. We had a discussion at that time \nabout Rosa Parks, whom we have just honored and who recently passed \naway. At that very site, Martin Luther King led the efforts of the bus \nboycott that ended the concept that a person must go to the back of the \nbus because of the color of their skin. Jon Corzine didn't have to go \nto Montgomery, but he was interested in those issues and he believed \nstrongly in equality and civil rights.\n  Senator Corzine has been a strong advocate for the Democratic Party \nand its principles, heading its campaign committee. We didn't agree on \nthose issues, but he was always courteous and professional. I cannot \nremember a single harsh word that we have had. In fact, I cannot \nremember him having a harsh word with any other Senators.\n  I have enjoyed the opportunity to know Jon Corzine and to gain \nrespect for him. I wish him every success as Governor of the important \nState of New Jersey. That will be a challenge, but he has the gift and \nability necessary to be successful in that job.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate and bid \nfarewell to my friend and colleague, Jon Corzine.\n  Our world has changed quite drastically since Jon first joined the \nSenate. It has been an honor to work with him on the many issues we \nwere forced to confront following the terrorist attacks of September \n11, 2001. We will miss Jon's leadership and determination on behalf of \nhis constituents in New Jersey and the American people.\n  While Jon has served in the Senate for a relatively short period of \ntime, he leaves an important legacy of leadership on issues ranging \nfrom protecting our homeland to crafting legislation that stabilized \nour financial markets.\n  Rarely in this body does one Senator see the enactment one of their \nfirst bills introduced as a freshman Member. But Jon did just that when \nhe called for mandatory Federal standards to protect our Nation's \nchemical plants and saw that become law.\n  When the entire corporate and financial community was rocked by \npervasive accounting scandals, Jon was instrumental in crafting \nextraordinary changes to accounting oversight that stabilized \nconfidence in our markets when they were teetering. He recognized that \nAmericans were at risk, and he worked tirelessly on their behalf, a \nlegacy that will last well past his last day here in the Capitol.\n  Jon also brought to the Senate an appreciation of open and \naccountable Government. He saw security and accountability as going \nhand in hand, a way for citizens to know what their chosen \nrepresentatives are doing to ensure the health and safety of their own \nneighborhoods and communities. He recognized the need to balance the \never-changing need for security with the everlasting principles of \nopenness that make our democracy the strongest in the world. I was \npleased to work with him to protect the Freedom of Information Act \nwhich the current administration has sought to weaken at every turn of \nthe road.\n  As further testament to Jon's leadership and determination, he will \ncertainly be remembered for his work to secure an end to the terrible \ngenocide that the world has witnessed in western Sudan. As the ranking \nmember of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee, I can personally attest \nthat Jon repeatedly brought the reality of this terrible tragedy to the \nattention of all of us. He knew that the solution would not be \nDemocratic or Republican. Instead, he reached across the aisle, \ndemanded a call for action, and spoke eloquently for those without a \nvoice.\n  I will miss my friend Jon Corzine here in the Senate. I have enjoyed \nthe time we shared working together in this body. Marcelle and I wish \nhim all the best as he moves on to the new and exciting challenges that \nawait him in Trenton. His service to the American people in the United \nStates Senate has been selfless. His departure is a loss for the United \nStates Senate but a great gain for the citizens of New Jersey.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to my \ncolleague, Senator Jon Corzine, who is leaving the Senate and will be \nsworn in as the Governor of New Jersey on January 17, 2006.\n  I have greatly appreciated working with Senator Corzine during his \ntime in the Senate. We have served together on the Banking, Housing and \nUrban Affairs Committee, the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, \nand the Budget Committee. His depth of knowledge and experience will be \nmissed on these committees, and in the Senate as a whole.\n  While Senator Corzine will be continuing in public service, he has \nalready had a long and distinguished career. After serving in the \nMarine Corps, he received an MBA from the University of Chicago and \nbegan working in\n\n[[Page S13732]]\n\nthe private sector, rising to be the co-chief executive officer at \nGoldman Sachs. He decided to enter public service and was elected to \nthe Senate in 2000 where he has worked tirelessly on behalf of the \npeople of New Jersey. In November, Senator Corzine was elected to be \nGovernor of New Jersey and I am confident he will continue his \noutstanding public service work in this new position.\n  I am very pleased that while he served in the Senate, Senator Corzine \nhad the opportunity to visit my home State of South Dakota in 2002 \nduring my re-election campaign. The trip gave him the opportunity to \nexperience the beauty and friendliness of South Dakota, and I know that \nthose who met Senator Corzine were very impressed with him and pleased \nthat he had visited the State.\n  Once again, I would like to thank Senator Corzine for his \nextraordinary service in the Senate and wish him the very best on his \nnew challenges and opportunities as Governor of New Jersey.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise to say a word or two about our good \nfriend Senator Corzine, who will be leaving the Senate to assume the \ngovernorship of New Jersey.\n  What I would like to do--because I have heard a lot about Senator \nCorzine and his background in Illinois today--is to talk about when I \nsaw him in action for the first time. It was when the Senate was \nworking on the post 9/11 airline relief legislation. A lot of us were \nvery troubled about how that ought to be done. We were sympathetic to \nthe needs of the airlines after 9/11 but concerned about the very large \nsums of money that were going to be directed to one sector of our \neconomy when many of our important economic sectors were hurt after 9/\n11; in that period when our country suffered tragically in New York but \nwhere there were economic ramifications across the country.\n  That legislation would not have passed if Senator Corzine, along with \nhelp from our former colleague, Senator Fitzgerald, had not stepped in \nand figured out how to deal with the financing in a responsible way \nthat protected taxpayers while providing some help to the airlines. \nSenator Corzine took out a sharp pencil, using the expertise he had \nacquired in his years at Goldman Sachs and throughout his training in \nfinance, and figured out how to make sure there was not a bailout in \neffect for just one sector that would have taxpayers holding the bag \nand was sensitive to the needs of all concerned.\n  I was struck, as I watched him deal with that airline legislation, \nhow in this individual a combination of compassion, fairness, and \nintelligence worked in a very quiet and dignified way to bring together \ndifferent parties, different Senators who had widely diverse views, and \ntackled an issue of great importance.\n  I think that is exactly what he is going to do when he assumes the \nGovernorship of New Jersey. He is going to bring exactly that \ncombination of fairness, compassion, and brains, always done in a kind \nof low-key, understated way. I believe the people of New Jersey will \nbenefit as they have in his service here in the U.S. Senate.\n  We hope Governor Corzine will come to Oregon because he has expressed \nan interest in looking at some of our innovative approaches, \nparticularly in the area of health care and the environment. We wish \nhim well and know he is going to have a very distinguished career as \nthe new Governor of New Jersey.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the career \nof my colleague Senator Jon Corzine of New Jersey. This institution has \nbenefited greatly from his presence, and the people of New Jersey can \nbe proud that such an energetic and compassionate man will continue to \nserve them as their new Governor.\n  Senator Corzine is a man that knows how to be successful, whether as \na leader in the field of investment banking or as a champion on behalf \nof the interest of working families as a U.S. Senator. His commitment \nto public service is commendable, and he has set a positive example for \nhis fellow lawmakers when it comes to establishing the right priorities \nfor Government. His philosophy is one of inclusion, which seeks to \nensure that no American is left out of the enterprise of this great \nNation.\n  I am particularly grateful for Senator Corzine's work on the Banking, \nHousing and Urban Affairs Committee. His was an early voice for \nrevamping the laws governing corporate accounting practices, long \nbefore the events of WorldCom and other accounting scandals destroyed \nthe savings of thousands of loyal employees and shareholders, \ntarnishing the reputation of corporate America. Before, during, and \nafter the debates that produced the landmark Sarbanes-Oxley corporate \naccountability legislation, Senator Corzine was there with the \nknowledge and energy to provide much needed solutions to a serious \nproblem. He has also championed many other inventive policies to tackle \nour Nation's problems, including his ``Kid's Account'' lifetime savings \nplan, his work to protect individuals from identity theft, and his \ninitiatives to promote financial literacy for all Americans.\n  In addition to finding creative solutions to the financial problems \nthat our country faces, Senator Corzine has also been a reliable \ndefender of public education, affordable health care and prescription \ndrugs, and support for our men and women in uniform. As a member of the \nSenate Budget Committee, he has championed the priorities of everyday, \nworking Americans time and again. He consistently opposed the fiscal \npolicies that have led our Nation to such a dangerous budget deficit, \nchoosing instead to vote for sound economic and social policies that \nwould keep America strong and healthy.\n  I wish my colleague from New Jersey the best of luck as he enters \ninto this new chapter in his public life. His presence will be missed \nbut his work on behalf of working Americans will not be forgotten.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a great \nSenator and the Governor-elect of New Jersey, Jon Corzine. While \nSenator Corzine has only been in the Senate for 5 short years, he has \nmade an indelible mark on our Nation and on his Senate colleagues, \nmyself included. I have had the opportunity and pleasure of serving \nwith Senator Corzine on the Senate Intelligence Committee, seeing \nfirsthand his patriotism, his dedication to our Nation, and his work \nethic.\n  Senator Corzine has been an invaluable resource here in the Senate, \nespecially as we confronted the corporate scandals of recent years. \nWith his expertise as the former CEO and chairman of Goldman Sachs, we \nlooked to Senator Corzine during the reform process. He stepped up to \nthe challenge, helping push through sweeping changes in our Nation's \ncorporate governance. I know that he is proud of this accomplishment, \nand our Nation is better for his efforts.\n  While Senators come to Washington to represent their States, their \nactions have consequences for every American citizen. America has been \nwell served by having Jon Corzine in the Senate and I know that the \ncitizens of New Jersey could not have chosen a better man to serve as \ntheir Governor. He will bring not only his work ethic and intellect, \nbut a unique blend of Government and corporate experience to bear on \nthe challenges facing New Jersey.\n  I have been proud to call Senator Corzine my colleague, and I \ncongratulate him on his election. I also want to wish him luck on the \nnew responsibilities he takes on and the new challenges he will face. \nSenator Corzine, you will be missed.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues in thanking \nthe gentleman from New Jersey, Senator Jon Corzine, for his service to \nthe people of the Garden State and the rest of our country. My \ncolleague and friend brought his extensive experience from corporate \nAmerica to bear on the business that we conduct here, and our country \ngreatly benefitted from his expertise.\n  I enjoyed working with Senator Corzine during the time when I served \non the Banking Committee. Under the leadership of Ranking Member \nSarbanes, we shored up corporate governance through the enactment of \nSarbanes-Oxley--the influence of which has been felt in corporate \nboardrooms, and even nonprofit boardrooms, across America.\n  The Senate and the Congress will especially miss the dedication of \nour colleague in the effort to promote economic and financial literacy. \nSenator Corzine has been a stalwart in working with me, and Senators \nSarbanes,\n\n[[Page S13733]]\n\nStabenow, Enzi, Allen, and others, to bring to light the need to \nreverse economic and financial illiteracy in our country.\n  Senator Corzine has been an important ally in supporting several of \nmy initiatives in this area, including annual efforts to secure and \nincrease funding for the Excellence in Economic Education Act for \ngrades K through 12; efforts to work on college campuses through the \nCollege Literacy in Finance and Economics or LIFE Act, S. 468; and \nannual resolutions designating April as the month for highlighting the \nneed for financial literacy.\n  I have been a proud cosponsor of his initiatives in this area, S. \n923, S. 924, and S. 925. The TANF Financial Education Promotion Act, S. \n923, requires a State to specify how it intends to establish goals and \ntake action to promote financial education among parents and caretakers \nreceiving Temporary Assistance for Needy Families assistance. The \nEducation for Retirement Security Act, S. 924, authorizes grants for \nfinancial education programs targeted toward mid-life and older \nAmericans, including striving to increase financial and retirement \nknowledge and reduce individuals' vulnerability to financial abuse and \nfraud. Finally, the Youth Financial Education Act, S. 925, authorizes \ngrants to State educational agencies for the development and \nintegration of youth financial education programs for students in \nelementary and secondary schools, as well as a grant to establish and \noperate a national clearinghouse for instructional materials and \ninformation regarding model financial education programs and best \npractices.\n  It is clear that my colleague from New Jersey cares about giving \npeople access to additional tools that can help them make decisions \nabout credit and debt management, spending and saving, and essential \nchoices in a world of limited resources, in addition to helping \nincrease their financial acumen so as to avoid being taken in by \npredatory credit offers and unscrupulous marketing. I commend him for \ntaking this broad view, and wish him and his family well as he goes on \nto lead the Garden State as its Governor.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, today I rise to pay tribute to my friend \nand colleague Senator and now Governor-elect Jon Corzine. With his \nelection to the Senate in 2000, Jon Corzine has been a source of wisdom \nand a great friend to me and to many of my colleagues.\n  Jon Corzine was elected to the Senate after serving as cochairman and \ncochief executive officer of the investment company Goldman Sachs. \nDuring his time in the Senate, he has focused on serving the State of \nNew Jersey, applying his financial expertise to major economic and \nregulatory issues and pushing a forward-looking, progressive agenda.\n  Senator Corzine has pursued new safeguards to protect chemical \nfacilities against terrorist attack, introduced legislation to improve \naccess to education and health care, fought for stronger environmental \npolicies, and lead the effort in Congress to crack down on corporate \nabuse.\n  The Senate recently adopted Senator Corzine's resolution declaring \nthe need for new safeguards at the Nation's vulnerable chemical plants. \nHe also secured Federal funding toward the construction of a second \nrailroad tunnel underneath the Hudson River, long sought by New \nJersey's congressional delegation, and won Federal support for a wide \nvariety of community and economic development projects throughout the \nState of New Jersey.\n  On a more personal note, it has been a great pleasure for me to work \nwith such a gifted and dedicated public servant. He has never hesitated \nto put the people of New Jersey and the people of this Nation first. \nThe people of New Jersey have made a wise choice in selecting Senator \nCorzine to be the chief executive of their great State. He will take \nthe same enthusiasm and professionalism to the Governor's mansion that \nhe has exhibited here in the Senate.\n  I wish him well in his new responsibilities. I know that he will be a \nbenefit to the people of his home State of New Jersey. We will miss his \npassion and insight here in the Senate. But our loss will be the people \nof New Jersey's gain. Farewell and Godspeed.\n  Mr LEVIN. Mr. President, although we will miss him greatly in the \nSenate, I join my colleagues in congratulating Senator Jon Corzine on \nhis election as Governor of New Jersey. It has been a pleasure to serve \nwith Jon on the Intelligence Committee and to work with him on issues \nof corporate accountability. He has been a strong and determined leader \nhere, and I know he will continue to make the people of New Jersey \nproud in his new position.\n  Jon Corzine has led a distinctly American life. He grew up on a \nfamily farm. He served his country in the Marine Corps Reserves. He had \nextraordinary success in business as a self-made man. And he has \ncontinued to serve his country in public life, first as a Senator and \nsoon as a Governor. Jon loves America and fights for what he believes \nis best for our people.\n  In the Senate, Jon has used the financial expertise he gained at \nGoldman Sachs to become a singularly credible voice for corporate \nreform. He was a driving force on the landmark Sarbanes-Oxley \nlegislation, which cracked down on corporate abuses such as those that \nled to the Enron and WorldCom scandals. He has been a leader on \nstrengthening oversight of the mutual fund industry and on protecting \nthe financial privacy of Americans. Jon has also been at the forefront \nof promoting financial literacy, so that Americans can manage their \npersonal finances wisely.\n  Working with Jon on the Intelligence Committee, I have seen Jon's \npiercing mental acumen and commitment to protecting our country. \nFollowing the September 11 attacks, which took a heavy toll on his \nState, Jon recognized the weakness of our system of chemical plant \nsecurity. He seized that issue and did not let go. In October, Congress \nfinally passed mandatory security requirements at chemical plants based \non Jon's work. That this necessary improvement in our security will be \nsubstantially improved is due to his tenacity.\n  On every issue, Jon has been outspoken in support of policies that \nbenefit working Americans. He has fought for universal health care, for \nexpanded student aid, and for full funding for education programs. Jon \nhas also been a passionate voice for human rights around the world. \nJust last month, the Senate approved the Darfur Peace and \nAccountability Act, which Jon sponsored with Senator Brownback, to help \nstop the genocide in the Sudan.\n  During his short time in the Senate, Jon Corzine has made a big \nimpact. His is a unique voice that will be personally missed. I join my \ncolleagues in saluting Jon on his election as Governor and in wishing \nhim well in his new position.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am proud today to join in honoring Jon \nCorzine and congratulating him on his outstanding service here in the \nSenate. I have had the pleasure of working with him for 5 years and \nhave found him to be a tremendous ally on a number of issues, as well \nas a great friend and colleague.\n  This Senate has benefited enormously from his hard work and \ncommitment since he came to this body in 2001. I have served with him \non both the Foreign Relations and the Budget Committees, and I have \nseen him work diligently and effectively, with members from both sides \nof the aisle, and always in the best interests of the American people.\n  Senator Corzine has led the effort to stop the ongoing violence in \nDarfur with the bipartisan Darfur Peace and Accountability Act of 2005, \nof which I am a cosponsor. I applaud his efforts in this area, as well \nas his work to reaffirm support for the Convention on the Prevention \nand Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. This is a critically important \nlegacy as the world faces the tragedy in Sudan. There has never been a \nmore important time for the U.S. to recommit itself to ending the crime \nof genocide, and Senator Corzine has taken a lead role in that effort.\n  We have also worked together on issues of great concern to us both--\nracial profiling and the death penalty. On both these issues, Senator \nCorzine has been a courageous voice for justice and fairness. He has \nbeen steadfast in his efforts to ban racial profiling, a practice that \nruns contrary to the fundamental American value of equal treatment \nunder the law. And he has been just as dedicated in focusing attention\n\n[[Page S13734]]\n\non the glaring flaws in the administration of capital punishment, and \nin calling for a thorough, nationwide review of the death penalty.\n  Finally, I want to say that I am deeply grateful for Senator \nCorzine's support for the amendments I offered during the Senate's \nconsideration of the PATRIOT Act in October of 2001. I was proud to \nhave his support that night, and I have been proud to work with him as \na cosponsor of the SAFE Act. I can't think of a better time to thank \nhim for his work to protect Americans' freedoms than today, in the \nmidst of a fight to make reasonable changes to the PATRIOT Act.\n  Jon Corzine has earned the utmost admiration and respect during his \ntime in the Senate. I will miss him as a colleague and friend, but I am \nso glad that he will continue to serve the people of New Jersey with \nsuch dedication and integrity. I have no doubt that he will be an \noutstanding Governor, and that he will continue to be a national leader \non the issues to which he was so committed in the Senate.\n  So today I join my colleagues in thanking Senator Corzine for his \nwork in this body. He is a great public servant and a good friend. I \nwish him all the best.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, it is my honor today to pay tribute and \nbid a fond farewell to my colleague and friend Senator Jon S. Corzine \nof New Jersey. Senator Corzine as we know will be leaving the Senate \nnext month to serve as New Jersey's Governor, and before he leaves us \nto begin what I can only be certain will be a wildly successful and \ninnovative tenure as New Jersey's chief executive, I thought it \nappropriate to take the time to celebrate not only Mr. Corzine's fine \nservice in the Senate but his inspiring life story as well.\n  In many ways, Jon Corzine's life is an example of the American dream \nfulfilled. Mr. Corzine was born on New Year's Day, 1947, and grew up on \nhis family's farm in Willey's Station, IL. His father ran the farm and \nsold insurance; his mother was a public school teacher. Through his own \nhard work and that of his family, Mr. Corzine attended the University \nof Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he graduated Phi Beta Kappa in \n1969. After graduating college, Mr. Corzine served his country by \nenlisting in the U.S. Marine Corps Reserves, and he continued in the \nReserves until 1975, rising to the rank of sergeant in his infantry \nunit.\n  After Senator Corzine's Active Duty was up, he began what would \nbecome a long and successful career in the finance sector. His first \njob was with the Continental Illinois National Bank in Chicago, where \nhe worked as a portfolio analyst. At the same time, Mr. Corzine began \ntaking night classes at the University of Chicago's Graduate School of \nBusiness, where he received his MBA in 1973.\n  In 1975, after working briefly at a regional bank in Ohio, Mr. \nCorzine was recruited to go to work for the New York investment firm \nGoldman Sachs as a bond trader, beginning what would be a meteoritic \nrise through the company's ranks. After only 5 years, Mr. Corzine was \nnamed a partner in the firm. In 1994, Mr. Corzine became both the \nfirm's chairman and chief executive officer. Through hard work, Senator \nCorzine rose from his family's farm in rural Illinois to being the \nchief executive officer of a New York investment firm.\n  But the story doesn't end there for Mr. Corzine had a very successful \ntenure at the helm of Goldman Sachs. When he took over in 1994, the \nproud and respected firm was in a period of some decline. But Mr. \nCorzine and his team turned the company's fortunes upwards. During his \n5 years as chief executive, Mr. Corzine also oversaw the firm's \nsuccessful transition from a private partnership to a public company.\n  While serving as chief executive, Mr. Corzine also demonstrated a \npassion for public service. Under his leadership, Goldman Sachs was a \nstrong corporate citizen, expanding its community outreach and \nphilanthropic programs. Mr. Corzine also chaired a Presidential \ncommission that studied how capital budgeting could be used to increase \nFederal investment in education.\n  It is this commitment to public service that I saw Jon Corzine bring \nto his work in the Senate everyday. Elected in 2000 by the people of \nNew Jersey, Senator Corzine has been a tireless advocate for corporate \naccountability, helping co-author the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and has \nworked to protect our environment, where he has been a steadfast ally \nin the fights to prevent drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge and to tackle climate change. On the international front, \nSenator Corzine has sponsored the Darfur Accountability Act, an act I \nam proud to cosponsor, which seeks to address the terrible genocide \ncurrently occurring in the Darfur region of Sudan.\n  What I will remember most about Senator Corzine's tenure is his \ncommitment to strengthening our Nation's homeland security. Having \nworked with Senator Corzine on several homeland security issues, I know \nfirsthand that he was determined to do everything in his power to \nprotect the American people from another terrorist attack. Senator \nCorzine and I worked together in passing legislation that created the \n9/11 Commission, whose service to the American people we are all well \naware of. In addition, Senator Corzine has been a leader in legislative \nefforts to increase security at our Nation's chemical plants, which \nremain vulnerable to attack. Senator Corzine crafted strong legislation \naimed at protecting these facilities, and I remain hopeful that \nCongress will act on this area of great vulnerability. I will continue \nto be inspired by the dedication Senator Corzine applied to this \ncritical issue.\n  Let me end my statement, Mr. President, by taking the time to thank \nJon Corzine for his service in the Senate. I wish him, his wife Carla \nKatz, his daughter Jennifer, and his two sons, Josh and Jeffrey, \nnothing but the best for the future, and I look forward to seeing the \nfine things I know he will continue to do for the people of New Jersey, \nnow as their Governor. Once again, thank you, Jon Corzine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak briefly about our \ncolleague Senator Jon Corzine, congratulate him on his recent election \nas Governor of New Jersey, and also thank him for his great \ncontribution to the Senate and to the entire country during the time he \nserved here.\n  Jon came to the Senate from a very successful career on Wall Street. \nWe are all aware of that. He came here for the best of reasons: his \ndesire to make a difference, to improve the situation of average \nAmericans in this country, to see that this country pursued an economic \ncourse that created opportunity and jobs for the people he represented \nin New Jersey and throughout this country.\n  On economic issues, I think all of us in the Senate came to believe--\nI certainly did--that no one was better able to read the tea leaves \nabout what was happening economically in this country, what was \nhappening in the various economic statistics which come out each week, \nthan Jon Corzine. He could understand the economic circumstance we \ncontinue to struggle with in this country and the impact it is having \non the lives of average Americans.\n  While he has been here, he has demonstrated a passion for fairness to \nall in our society. He has not been a representative of Wall Street. He \nhas been a representative of the great mass of the American people. He \nhas looked to raise the standard of living of all Americans and lift \nall boats. We all owe him a debt of gratitude for that passion he has \nbrought to this job.\n  I serve as the ranking Democrat on the Senate Energy and Natural \nResources Committee. We have been very fortunate that Jon has served on \nthat committee as well. He has been an active participant in the \nwriting of energy legislation, which we passed earlier this year. He \nmade a great contribution in that legislation. In short, Jon has had a \nvery distinguished career in the Senate. I am confident he will have a \nvery distinguished career as Governor of New Jersey and will have a \nvery long and successful career in public life.\n  Again I congratulate him on his victory. I thank him for his service \nand his friendship, and I look forward to opportunities to work with \nhim again in his new capacity as Governor of New Jersey.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I wish to take this opportunity to say \nfarewell to the distinguished Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Jon S. \nCorzine. In\n\n[[Page S13735]]\n\nJanuary, he will resign his seat, bound for greener pastures. While he \nwill be missed tremendously in this Chamber, I know that, as Governor, \nhe will serve the people of New Jersey well.\n  Senator Corzine and I were elected to the Senate in the same year, \nand I have since been glad to have his friendship and advice. I would \nalso like to say, how fortunate New Jersey has been to be represented \nby Senator Corzine. I am proud of the work that we did together in the \ntime we shared in the Senate and am sad to see him go.\n  Along with his dedication to building a practical, progressive \nGovernment, Senator Corzine always brought a fresh and original \nperspective to this body. His previous career as cochairman and CEO at \nGoldman Sachs allowed him the benefit of invaluable experience in \nhelping to solve the problems that face our economy and our financial \nsector. His combination of principle and practice, are, more than \nanything, what the Senate will sorely miss.\n  Consider Senator Corzine's role in crafting the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of \n2002. His work on this bipartisan legislation helped produce reforms \nthat, in the wake of corporate abuse scandals, restored confidence in \nthe markets, protected shareholders, and ensured that additional and \nmore impartial oversight would act to prevent the damage to our economy \nthat might flow from unchecked corporate malfeasance. Senator Corzine \nstood by his principles, worked with Democrats and Republicans, and \nused his expertise to help craft legislation to promote ethics, \naccountability, and economic growth.\n  We can also look to Senator Corzine's efforts to end the crisis \nravaging Darfur, Sudan. I was proud to cosponsor the legislation by \nSenator Corzine and Senator Sam Brownback to expand aid to the African \nUnion and provide a framework for tackling the ongoing violence. We can \nall be proud that Senator Corzine was able to help usher the Darfur \nPeace and Accountability Act through the Senate. His dedication to the \nissue and commitment to stopping the genocide is admirable, to say the \nleast. Senator Corzine has stood by his values, and worked hard to see \nthose values reflected in the work of the Senate, the Congress, and the \nNation.\n  Recently, I joined Senator Corzine in introducing legislation to help \nthe victims of sexual assault receive the medical treatment they need \nand deserve. Senator Corzine believes as I do that we have a duty to \nthese women; a woman who has already suffered so much should not have \nto worry about whether she will be offered emergency contraception to \nprevent an unwanted pregnancy. Senator Corzine's passion for protecting \nand improving access to health care and medical treatment, and to \nprotecting the rights of patients, is truly exemplary.\n  Finally, Senator Corzine served New Jersey and his constituents with \ncompassion and dedication in the days, weeks, months, and years \nfollowing the attacks on September 11, 2001. New Jersey and New York \nshared in so much grief and loss that day, and Senator Corzine was \ntireless in his commitment to the citizens of New Jersey who bore the \nburden of that loss.\n  In the years since, he has remained steadfast in fighting for the \nfamilies of 9/11 and fighting to strengthen our Nation to prevent \nfuture acts of terrorism. His hard work to secure our Nation's \nvulnerable chemical facilities serves as a noteworthy example. I was \nproud to cosponsor his legislation to safeguard our Nation's chemical \nplants, the Chemical Security Act, and share in his commitment to doing \nall we can to strengthen America's homeland security.\n  I would also acknowledge Senator Corzine's tenure at the Democratic \nSenatorial Campaign Committee. In his leadership at the DSCC and \nthroughout his time in office, Senator Corzine served with honesty, \nintegrity, and a passion for improving the lives of all Americans.\n  Jon Corzine's absence will long be felt in the Senate, as will his \ngood work. He brought his expertise and values to bear on the \nchallenges facing our economy, our security, and our country.\n  To the great benefit of the citizens of New Jersey, Jon Corzine--\nwhile retiring from the Senate will bring his values, his expertise, \nhis passion, and his dedication with him to the Governorship of the \nGarden State. The citizens of New Jersey will no doubt continue to be \nfortunate to have Jon Corzine in their corner.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, as Senator Corzine spends his final \ndays representing the people of New Jersey in the Senate, I wish to \nspend a few moments speaking about his commitment to human rights and \nthe pressing crisis of genocide in Darfur, Sudan.\n  I have worked on the issue of war and humanitarian disaster in Sudan \nfor several years. But nearly 2 years ago, as the Comprehensive Peace \nAgreement for Sudan was in its final negotiations, we became aware of \nthe unfolding crisis in Sudan's western region of Darfur. It was \nSenator Corzine who came to me to work together and champion this \nissue. We joined each other on the Senate floor in countless speeches \nshowing photos of the anguish in Darfur. We joined each other in seeing \nthe Darfur Peace and Accountability Act through the Senate. We joined \neach other to secure funding for the security and humanitarian needs of \nthe people.\n  I have had the opportunity to work with many Members across party \nlines on human rights and humanitarian issues. I remember partnering \nwith Paul Wellstone on the Trafficking Victims' Protection Act. Some \ncalled us strange bedfellows since we were at opposite ends of the \npolitical spectrum. But I have learned an important lesson: these \nissues are sufficiently urgent that ideological and partisan \ndifferences should not be allowed to impede cooperation, especially \nwhere lives and basic freedoms are at stake. And such has been true in \nthe case of Darfur. I have no doubt that Senator Corzine's commitment \nand perseverance to raise this issue to the highest levels has made a \ndifference to the people of Darfur. I also saw firsthand his sincere \ncompassion and commitment to the suffering of the world when we \ntraveled to tsunami-ravaged South Asia together earlier this year.\n  I will always consider Senator Corzine an ally and a friend on one of \nthe greatest moral issues in foreign policy today. In his absence, I \nwill look to my other colleagues to ensure that this crisis is not \neasily forgotten.\n  As we close out 2005, I urge my colleagues to secure additional \nfunding for the African Union in the Defense Appropriations conference \nand I urge my colleagues in the House to pass the Darfur Peace and \nAccountability Act. Without continued action by the United States and \nthe international community, more lives will be lost.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to formally and publicly thank \nSenator Corzine for his partnership and his commitment to the people of \nDarfur. I express my very best wishes as he leaves this body to become \nthe next Governor of New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I believe I am to be recognized by \nunanimous consent directly following the tributes to Senator Corzine. I \nwould like to give my heartfelt thanks to the Senator from New Jersey. \nHe has been indeed a good Senator. His tenure here has distinguished \nhim. That is clearly recognized by people of New Jersey. I believe he \nis going to be a great Governor for that great State.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield me 30 seconds?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Certainly.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the very able Senator from California for her \nyielding to allow these tributes to be paid to Senator Corzine. I know \nshe has been here quite a while waiting to speak on another issue. It \nwas extremely gracious of her to do that. I wanted to recognize that \nand thank her very much.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Will the Senator yield for my last word?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I certainly will.\n  Mr. CORZINE. I am appreciative of the Senator's gracious and kind \nwords as well. I follow with great interest her views and visions on a \nlot of major issues of the day. I know she is going to speak on one of \nthe more important ones in a few minutes. I am particularly \nappreciative of her kindness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/16/senate-section/article/S13736-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13736-S13749]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S13736]]\n                            THE PATRIOT ACT\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today as a 12-year member of \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee and a 5-year member of the Senate \nIntelligence Committee. I do so indeed with a very heavy heart. I have \nhad, until now, great confidence in America's intelligence activities. \nI have assured people time and time again that what happens at home has \nalways been conducted in accordance with the law.\n  I played a role in the PATRIOT Act. I moved one of the critical \namendments having to do with the wall and the FISA court. Today's \nallegations as written in the New York Times really question whether \nthis is in fact true. I read it with a heavy heart, yet without knowing \nthe full story.\n  Let me be clear. Domestic intelligence collection is governed by the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act, known as FISA. This law sets out \na careful set of checks and balances that are designed to ensure that \ndomestic intelligence collection is conducted in accordance with the \nConstitution, under the supervision of judges and with accountability \nto the Congress of the United States.\n  Specifically, FISA allows the Government to wiretap phones or to open \npackages, but only with a showing to a special court--the FISA court--\nand after meeting a legal standard that requires that the effort is \nbased on probable cause to believe the target is an agent of a foreign \npower.\n  Let me cite two sources. The first is a 1978 report by the Senate \nSelect Committee on Intelligence. In the report is a comment by the \nthen-chairman of that committee, Senator Birch Bayh. He is talking \nabout the FISA bill that had just come to the floor in 1978:\n\n       The bill requires a court order for electronic \n     surveillance, defined therein, conducted for foreign \n     intelligence purposes within the United States or targeted \n     against the international communications of particular United \n     States persons who are in the United States. The bill \n     establishes the exclusive means by which such surveillance \n     may be conducted.\n\n  That is the bill, FISA, which was passed in 1978.\n  Second, in late 2001 this subject came up again on the Senate \nIntelligence Committee. The Senate Intelligence Committee discussed \nthis subject and amended at that time in its authorization bill \nNational Security Act section 502, which is the reporting of \nintelligence activities other than covert action.\n  Section 502 states:\n\n       To the extent consistent with due regard for the protection \n     from unauthorized disclosure of classified information \n     relating to sensitive intelligence sources and methods or \n     other exceptionally sensitive matters, the Director of \n     Central Intelligence and the heads of all departments, \n     agencies, and other entities of the United States Government \n     involved in intelligence activities shall:\n       (1) keep the congressional intelligence committees--\n\n  It doesn't say only the chairman and the vice chairman--\n\n     fully and currently informed of all intelligence activities \n     other than a covert action (as defined in section 503(e)), \n     which are not the responsibility of, are engaged in by, or \n     are carried out for or on behalf of any department, agency, \n     or entity of the United States Government, including any \n     significant anticipated intelligence activity and any \n     significant intelligence failure.\n       And (2) furnish the congressional intelligence committees \n     any information or material concerning intelligence \n     activities, other than covert actions, which is within their \n     custody or control, and which is requested by either of the \n     congressional intelligence committees in order to carry out \n     its authorized responsibilities.\n\n  At that time, we had this discussion about just the chairman and the \nvice chairman receiving certain information, and this act was amended, \nand section (b) was added to the National Security Act, called ``form \nand contents of certain reports.'' It was to clarify what the form and \ncontent of the reporting to the committee would be. And the wording is \nas follows:\n\n       Any report relating to a significant anticipated \n     intelligence activity or a significant intelligence failure \n     that is submitted to the congressional intelligence \n     committees for the purposes of subsection (a)(1) shall be in \n     writing and shall contain the following:\n       (1) a concise statement of any fact pertinent to such \n     report;\n       (2) an explanation of the significance of the intelligence \n     activity or intelligence failure covered by such report.\n\n  And then section (c) was added, ``standards and procedures for \ncertain reports,'' that those standards and procedures would hereby be \nestablished.\n  What has happened is that it has become increasingly used just to \nnotify a very few people. There are 535 Members of the Senate and the \nHouse of Representatives of the United States.\n  If the President of the United States is not going to follow the law \nand he simply alerts eight Members, that doesn't mean he doesn't \nviolate a law. I repeat, that doesn't mean he doesn't violate a law. \nFISA is the exclusive law in this area, unless there is something I \nmissed, and please, someone, if there is, bring it to my attention.\n  Section 105(f) of FISA allows for emergency applications where time \nis of the essence. But even in these cases, a judge makes the final \ndecision as to whether someone inside the United States of America, a \ncitizen or a noncitizen, is going to have their communications \nwiretapped or intercepted. The New York Times reports that in 2004, \nover 1,700 warrants for this kind of wiretapping activity were approved \nby the FISA Court. The fact of the matter is, FISA can grant emergency \napproval for wiretaps within hours and even minutes, if necessary.\n  In times of war, FISA section 111 states this:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other law, the President, through the \n     Attorney General, may authorize electronic surveillance \n     without a court order under this title to acquire foreign \n     intelligence information for a period not to exceed 15 \n     calendar days following a declaration of war by the Congress.\n\n  I would argue the resolution authorizing use of force was not a \ndeclaration of war. I read it this morning carefully. It does not \nauthorize the President of the United States to do anything other than \nuse force. It doesn't say he can wiretap people in the United States of \nAmerica. And apparently, perhaps with some change, but apparently this \nactivity has been going on unbeknownst to most of us in this body and \nin the other body now since 2002.\n  The newspaper, the New York Times, states that the President \nunilaterally decided to ignore this law and ordered subordinates to \nmonitor communications outside of this legal authority.\n  In the absence of authority under FISA, Americans up till this point \nhave been confident--and we have assured them--that such surveillance \nwas prohibited.\n  This is made explicit in chapter 119 of title 18 of the criminal code \nwhich makes it a crime for any person without authorization to \nintentionally intercept any wire, oral, or electronic communication.\n  As a member of the Senate Judiciary and Intelligence Committees, I \nhave been repeatedly assured by this administration that their efforts \nto combat terrorism were being conducted within the law, specifically \nwithin the parameters of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act \nwhich, as I have just read, makes no exception other than 15 days \nfollowing a declaration of war.\n  We have changed aspects of that law at the request of the \nadministration in the USA PATRIOT Act to allow for a more aggressive \nbut still lawful defense against terror. So there have been amendments. \nBut if this article is accurate, it calls into question the integrity \nand credibility of our Nation's commitment to the rule of law.\n  I refreshed myself this morning on the fourth amendment to the Bill \nof Rights of the Constitution of the United States. Here is what it \nsays:\n\n       The right of the people to be secure in their persons, \n     houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable search and \n     seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, \n     but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, \n     and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the \n     persons or things to be seized.\n\n  Clearly an intercept, a wiretap, is a search. It is a common \ninterpretation. A wiretap is a search. You are looking for something. \nIt is a search. It falls under the fourth amendment.\n  Again, the New York Times states that a small number of Senators, as \nI said, were informed of this decision by the President. That doesn't \ndiminish the import of this issue, and that certainly doesn't mean that \nthe action was within the law or legal.\n  What is concerning me, as a member of the Intelligence Committee, is \nif eight people, rather than 535 people, can know there is going to be \nan illegal act and they were told this under an intelligence umbrella--\nand therefore, their lips are sealed--does that make the act any less \nculpable? I don't think so.\n\n[[Page S13737]]\n\n  The resolution passed after September 11 gave the President specific \nauthority to use force, including powers to prevent further terrorist \nacts in the form of force. I would like to read it. I read Public Law \n107-40, 107th Congress:\n\n       Sec. 1. Short title.\n       This joint resolution may be cited as the ``Authorization \n     for Use of Military Force''.\n       Sec. 2. Authorization for Use of United States Armed \n     Forces.\n       (A) In General.--That the President is authorized to use \n     all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, \n     organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, \n     committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on \n     September 11, 2001, or harbored such organizations or \n     persons, in order to prevent any future acts of international \n     terrorism against the United States by such nations, \n     organizations, or persons.\n\n  Then it goes on to say:\n\n       Consistent with section 8(a)(1) of the War Powers \n     Resolution, the Congress declares that this section is \n     intended to constitute specific statutory authorization \n     within the meaning of section 5(b) of the War Powers \n     Resolution.\n\n  This is use of force. It is not use of wiretapping or electronic \nsurveillance of American citizens or those without citizenship within \nthe confines of the United States. That is the jurisdiction of the FISA \nCourt. There is a procedure, and it is timely.\n  As a matter of fact, we got into this rather seriously in the \nJudiciary Committee. At the time we wrote the PATRIOT Act, I offered an \namendment to change what is called ``the wall'' between domestic \nintelligence-gathering agencies and foreign intelligence-gathering \nagencies from a ``primary purpose'' for the collection of foreign \nintelligence to a ``significant purpose.'' We had a major discussion in \nthe committee, as is the American way. We were making public policy. We \ndiscussed what primary purpose meant. We discussed in legal terms what \nsignificant purpose meant.\n  So this was a conscious loosening of a standard in the FISA law to \npermit the communication of one element of Government with the other \nand transfer foreign intelligence information from one element of the \nGovernment to the other.\n  That is the way this is done, by law. We are a government of law. The \nCongress was never asked to give the President the kind of unilateral \nauthority that appears to have been exercised.\n  Mr. BYRD. Right.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I was heartened when Senator Specter also said that \nhe believed that if the New York Times report is true--and the fact \nthat they have withheld the story for a year leads me to believe it is \ntrue, and I have heard no denunciation of it by the administration--\nthen it is inappropriate, it is a violation of the law.\n  How can I go out, how can any Member of this body go out, and say \nthat under the PATRIOT Act we protect the rights of American citizens \nif, in fact, the President is not going to be bound by the law, which \nis the FISA court?\n  And there are no exceptions to the FISA court.\n  So Senator Specter, this morning, as the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, announced that he would hold hearings on this matter the \nfirst thing next year. I truly believe this is the most significant \nthing I have heard in my 12 years. I am so proud of this Government \nbecause we are governed by the rule of law, and so few countries can \nreally claim that. I am so proud that nobody can be picked up in the \nmiddle of the night and thrown into jail without due process, and that \nthey have due process. That is what makes us different. That is why our \nGovernment is so special, and that is why this Constitution is so \nspecial. That is why the fourth amendment was added to the Bill of \nRights--to state clearly that searches and seizures must be carried out \nunder the parameter of law, not on the direction of a President \nunilaterally.\n  So I believe the door has been opened to a very major investigation \nand set of circumstances. I think people who know me in this body know \nI am not led toward hyperbole, but I cannot stress what happened when I \nread this story. And everything I hold dear about this country, \neverything I pledge my allegiance to in that flag, is this kind of \nprotection as provided by the Constitution of the United States and the \nlaws we labor to discuss, argue, debate, enact, then pressure the other \nbody to pass, and then urge the President to sign. That is our process.\n  If the President wanted this authority, he should have come to the \nIntelligence Committee for an amendment to FISA, and he did not. The \nfact that this has been going on since 2002--it is now the end of 2005. \nMaybe 8 people in these 2 bodies in some way, shape, or form may have \nknown something about it, but the rest of us on the Intelligence \nCommittees did not.\n  That is simply unacceptable.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from California for \nher remarks and associate myself with them. I commend her for taking on \nthis vital issue affecting all Americans.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the previous order be modified to permit \nSenator Byrd to precede me in speaking order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the very distinguished Senator from \nMinnesota for his kindness and his courtesy in yielding to me. I want \nto say there is one thing I am sorry about with respect to the Senator \nfrom Minnesota. He made a bad decision some time ago. I wish he had not \nmade it, and I begged him to retract on it and say he would not do it. \nHe says he is not going to run again. I am sorry about that. He is one \nof the immortal 23 Senators who voted against that resolution that the \nSenator from California is talking about. I voted against it. I have \nbeen in the Senate for 47 years, and that is the vote of which I am \nmost proud because in voting that way, I stood for this, the \nConstitution of the United States. That Constitution does not give any \nPresident the power to declare war. It says Congress shall have the \npower to declare war. I voted against that resolution, the best vote I \nhave cast in 47 years in this Senate, and I am proud that the Senator \nfrom Minnesota can carry that tribute with him to the grave. I thank \nhim and congratulate him. Again, I thank him for yielding to me.\n  Mr. President, I believe in America. Let me say that again. I believe \nin America. I believe in the dream of the Founders and Framers of our \ninspiring Constitution. I believe in the spirit that drove President \nAbraham Lincoln to risk all to preserve the Union. I believe in what \nPresident Kennedy challenged America to be--America, the great \nexperiment of democracy.\n  Where the strong are also just and the weak can feel secure, the soul \nand promise of America stands as a beacon, praise God, of freedom and a \nprotector of liberty which lights and energizes the people around the \nworld. Today, sadly, that beacon is dimmed. This administration's \nAmerica is becoming a place where the strong are arrogant and the weak \nare ignored. Fie on the administration.\n  Yes, we hear high-flung language from the White House about bringing \ndemocracy to a land where democracy has never been. We seem mesmerized \nwith glorious rhetoric about justice and liberty, but does the rhetoric \nreally match the reality of what our country has become?\n  Since the heinous attacks of September 11, I speak of the actions of \nour own Government, actions that have undermined the credibility of \nthis great Nation around the world. These actions taken one at a time \nmay seem justified, but taken as a whole they form an unsettling \npicture and tell a troubling story. Do we remember the abuses at Abu \nGhraib? They were explained as an aberration. Do we remember the abuses \nat Guantanamo Bay? They were denied as an exaggeration. Now we read \nabout this so-called policy of rendition--what a shame--a policy where \nthe U.S. taxpayers are funding secret prisons in foreign lands. What a \nword, ``rendition.'' What a word, ``rendition.'' Shame. It sounds so \nvague, almost harmless. But the practice of rendition is abhorrent.\n\n  Let me say that again. It sounds so vague, almost harmless, but the \npractice of rendition is abhorrent--abhorrent.\n  The administration's practice of rendition is an affront, an affront \nto the principles of freedom, the very opposite of principles we claim \nwe are trying to\n\n[[Page S13738]]\n\ntransplant to Iraq and to other rogue nations.\n  The administration claims that rendition is a valuable weapon in the \nwar on terror. But what is the value of having America's CIA sit as \njudge and jury while deciding just who might be a threat to our \nnational security? Such determinations receive no review by a court of \nlaw--none. The CIA simply swings into action, abducts a person from \nsome foreign country and flies them off to who knows where, with no \njudicial review of guilt or innocence. A person can be held in secret \nprisons in unnamed countries or even shipped off to yet another country \nto face torture at the hands of the secret police of brutal \ngovernments.\n  Is that what we want? Is this the America that our Founders \nconceived? Is this the America that Nathan Hale died for, when he said \nI only regret that I have but one life to lose for my country? Is this \nthe America that he died for? Is this the America that our Founders \nconceived? Is this the America of which millions of people dreamed? Is \nthis, I ask the Senate, the beacon of freedom inspiring other nations \nto follow?\n  The United States should state clearly and without question that we \nwill not torture prisoners and that we will abide by the treaties that \nwe signed, because to fail to do so is to lose the very humanity, the \nmorality that makes America different, that makes America the hope for \nindividual liberty around the world.\n  The disgusting, degrading, and damaging practice of rendition should \ncease immediately. Is this what Patrick Henry was talking about--give \nme liberty or give me death? It is not about who they are. ``It's not \nabout who they are. It's about who we are.'' Those are the words of my \ncolleague Senator John McCain, bless his heart. Senator McCain is a \nsenior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. He is a former \nprisoner of war. He knows what it is all about. And he is exactly \nright. There is no moral high ground in torture. There is no moral high \nground in the inhumane treatment of prisoners. Our misguided, thuggish \npractice of rendition has put a major blot on American foreign policy.\n  Now comes this similarly alarming effort to reauthorize the PATRIOT \nAct, retaining provisions that devastate many of our own citizens' \ncivil liberties here at home. What is happening? What is happening to \nour cherished America? Let us stop and look and listen and think. What \nis happening to our cherished America?\n  Any question raised about the wisdom of shredding constitutional \nprotections of civil liberties with roots that trail back centuries is \nmet with the disclaimer that the world has changed and that the 9/11 \nattacks are, in effect, a green light. Get that, a green light to trash \nthis Constitution, to seize private library records. Hear that.\n  Suppose I want to get a book out of the library. Suppose I want to \nread ``Loves Labors Lost.'' The disclaimer that the world has changed \nand that the 9/11 attacks are in effect a green light to trash the \nConstitution, to seize private library records--suppose I want to read \nabout ``A Tale of Two Cities.'' They are going to seize those library \nrecords? To search private property--how about that--without the \nknowledge of the owner? If you want to go in my house without my \nknowledge, without my wife's knowledge, to spy on ordinary citizens \naccused of no crime in a manner is a sick--a sick, s-i-c-k, perversion \nof our system of justice and it must not be allowed.\n  Paranoia must not be allowed to chip away at our civil liberties. \nDon't let it happen. The United States of America must not adopt the \nthuggish tactics of our enemies--no. We must not trash the fourth \namendment because the Senate is being stampeded at the end of a \ncongressional session. No.\n  Government fishing expeditions with search warrants written by FBI \nagents is not what the Framers had in mind. It is not what Benjamin \nFranklin had in mind. It is not what Morris had in mind. It is not what \nJames Wilson had in mind. Spying on ordinary, unsuspecting citizens--\nnot with that in mind. Without their knowledge? No. That is not what \nthe Framers had in mind. Handing the Government unilateral authority to \nkeep all evidence secret from a target so that it may never be \nchallenged in a court of law is not what the Framers had in mind.\n  Yesterday, I believe it was, we heard reports that the military has \nspied on Americans simply because they exercised their right to \npeaceably assemble and to speak their minds. What disgrace. What a \nshame. Today we hear, yes, we hear today that the military is tapping \nphone lines in our own country without the consent of a judge. Can you \nbelieve that? Here in this country, where liberty is supposed to \nprevail.\n  Go and ask that Statue of Liberty. Is that what it stands for?\n  No. Labeling civil disobedience and political dissent as domestic \nterrorism is not what the Framers had in mind.\n  Read history. What is the matter with us? Have we gone berserk? Read \nhistory. That is not what they had in mind.\n  Our Nation is the most powerful nation in the world. Why? Because our \nNation was founded on a principle of liberty. Benjamin Franklin said \n``those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little \ntemporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety.'' Our Founding \nFathers, intent on addressing the abuses they had suffered at the hands \nof an overzealous government, established--yes, it did--established a \nsystem of checks and balances, ensuring that there is a separation of \npowers--there is a separation of powers. Read it in the Constitution, \narticle I, article II, article III--a separation of powers so that no \none body may run amok with its agenda. These checks are what safeguards \nfreedom for you, Mr. President, and for me and for all others in this \nland. These checks are what safeguard freedom, and the American people \nare looking to us--yes, they are looking through those lenses there, \nthey are looking at us, yes. The people out on the broad prairies, out \non the plains, out in the valleys, out on the great shores, the frozen \nwastes of the North Pole, and, yes, that liberty extends everywhere. \nThat American liberty extends everywhere. And nobody may run amok with \nits agenda.\n  These checks are what safeguard freedom, and the American people are \nlooking to us--you, and me, Senator, you, Senator, and you, Mr. \nPresident--looking to us now to restore and protect that freedom.\n  So many have died protecting those freedoms. And we owe it to those \nbrave men and women to deliberate meaningfully and to ultimately \nprotect those freedoms that Americans cherish so deeply. The American \npeople deserve nothing less.\n  Earlier today, the Senate voted to stop a bill that would have \nallowed the abuses of American civil liberties to continue for another \n4 years. Shame. The message of this vote is not just about the PATRIOT \nAct but the message that the Senate can stand up, the Senate can stand \nagainst an overreaching Executive of any party, any party, any party \nthat has sacrificed our liberties and stained our standing before the \nworld.\n  The PATRIOT Act has gone too far. It has gone too far. Secret \nrenditions should be stopped. Torture must be outlawed. Our military \nshould not spy on our own people.\n  The Senate has spoken. Let us secure our country but not by \ndestroying our liberties.\n  Thank Almighty God for this Constitution and the Framers who wrote \nit, and the Founders of our Nation who risked their lives and their \nfortunes and their sacred honor. Thank God for checks and balances. \nThank God for the Senate, and may it always stand for the right.\n  I thank all Senators. I again thank the distinguished Senator from \nMinnesota. I want to tell him that I wish he and his family and loved \nones a merry Christmas, a merry Christmas. I thank him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: What is the order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is notified that there is no order \nafter the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask my friend to indulge me. I ask unanimous consent I \nfollow the Senator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n[[Page S13739]]\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I want to associate myself with the \nremarks made by the great Senator from West Virginia, and he is a great \nSenator. His 47 years of experience here and wisdom have made him an \ninvaluable Member of this body, a leader of this body, an invaluable \nmentor to newcomers such as myself, and his fidelity to the \nConstitution, his understanding of history, his understanding of the \nappropriate relationship of this body, as an independent branch of \nGovernment, with the executive branch has been patriotic, courageous, \nand right.\n  I thank him for his remarks and for his kind words.\n  I also want to share the outrage that he expressed, and the previous \nspeaker, the distinguished Senator from California expressed, about \nthese disclosures. Yet another one today, reading in the New York Times \nabout the secret spying on American citizens by the National Security \nAgency, in contravention of law and in contravention of previous policy \nunder Presidents, Republican and Democrat.\n  That, on top of the revelations about secret torture camps being \nconducted, again extra-illegally, by this administration, to the \ndetriment of the great name of the United States of America.\n  I see that the outstanding Senator from Arizona is on the floor and \nwill follow me with his remarks. To his enormous credit, he has been \nthe champion of putting the United States back on track and assuring \nthat we set the example, the proper example, for the rest of the world \nin how to conduct itself even under adverse circumstances.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nArizona is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. McCain, Mr. Lieberman and Mr. Durbin pertaining \nto the introduction of S. 2128 are located in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n\n                                Torture\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I salute Senator John McCain. He achieved \nsomething this week which is historic. He achieved an agreement with \nthe Bush administration on the issue of torture. That took a lot of \nhard work on his part. He took a 90-9 vote in the Senate with him to \nthe White House, meeting with the President's representatives.\n  What Senator McCain was seeking is something fundamental. He wanted \nto reaffirm in law the fact that the United States would still stand by \nits word and by its values, that we would not engage in torture even \nthough we are in this new age of terrorism and threat to America. He \nsaid: This is less about the enemy than it is about us, who we are and \nwhat we stand for.\n  I can recall during the debate on this issue, Senator McCain took the \nfloor and gave one of the best speeches I have heard in this Chamber, a \nspeech only he could give. As a former prisoner of war, a Navy pilot \nshot down over Vietnam, he was a victim of torture. No one else in this \nChamber, fortunately, can speak to it as he spoke to it. But in \nspeaking to it, he reminded us that torture is not American. It is not \na good means of interrogating prisoners or coming up with information \nto make America safer. There was a lengthy debate about whether his \nprovision would be included in the final legislation. Fortunately, the \nWhite House has agreed to include it.\n  I was happy to cosponsor that legislation. I have been raising this \nissue for the last several years. I know how controversial it can be. A \nfew months ago I had the spotlight focused on me for some comments made \nat this same desk. But I believe that the issue of torture is one that \nwe have to face forthrightly.\n  Last week I was traveling in northern Africa and visited with one of \nour ambassadors. He is an ambassador to one of the Muslim nations. We \ntalked about the challenges he faces with our involvement in Iraq. He \nsaid: The controversy about our involvement in Iraq paled in comparison \nto the controversy in his country about America's role when it came to \ntorture. He said: It is hard for the Muslim population and Arab \npopulations to understand why the United States would abandon a long-\nterm, multidecade commitment not to engage in torture once they were \ninvolved in a war involving Arabs and Muslims. He reminded me--and I \ndidn't need to be reminded--that we issue a human rights scorecard each \nyear from the Department of State. Some of the questions we ask of \ncountries around the world are: have you incarcerated someone without \ncharges? Are you holding them indefinitely? Are you torturing them? If \nthe answers are affirmative, we give them low marks.\n  Today, obviously, those countries are asking whether the Americans \nlive by the same standards they are imposing on others. John McCain's \nleadership, along with Senator John Warner, chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee, resulted in an important agreement to restate the \nmost basic and bedrock principle, that America will not engage in \ntorture. We will not engage in cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment \nof prisoners: First, because it is not American; second, because it \ninvites the same treatment on our soldiers and Americans; and third, \nbecause it doesn't work. We have found time and again, if you torture a \nperson they will say anything to make the torture stop. That doesn't \ngive you good information to make America safe. Let me salute Senator \nMcCain for his leadership.\n\n\n                       Eavesdropping on Americans\n\n  Mr. President, I am troubled by the reports in the New York Times and \nWashington Post today that this administration, since 9/11, has been \nengaged in a practice which I thought had been clearly prohibited in \nAmerica. That is the eavesdropping on individual American citizens, \nthose in America, by major agencies such as the National Security \nAgency. This all started some 30 years ago during President Nixon's \nadministration. It was an administration which created an enemies list. \nIf your name was on that list, be careful; J. Edgar Hoover would be \nlooking into every aspect of your life that he could. You might be \naudited by the Internal Revenue Service and you would be carefully \nwatched and monitored.\n  We decided that wasn't a good thing for any President to do. We made \nit clear that if you had good reason to eavesdrop on an American in the \ncommission of a crime, involvement in terrorist activity, that was one \nthing. But to say you could do it with impunity, without any legal \napproval, that was unacceptable.\n  Now we find it has been done for several years and several thousand \nAmericans have been the subject of this wiretapping and eavesdropping.\n  Mr. President, that is a troubling development. It says that this \nadministration has decided when it comes to basic rights of Americans, \nthey are above the law, not accountable; they don't have to go through \nthe courts, don't have to follow the ordinary judicial process. That is \nsomething that Congress has to stand up and fight. We have to make it \nclear that even in the age of terrorism, basic freedoms and liberties \nof Americans have to be respected.\n  I hope that as soon as we return from this holiday break the \nappropriate committees will initiate investigations, determine what has \noccurred, whether it has gone too far. I sincerely hope, on a \nbipartisan basis, that my colleagues will rally to once again assert \nthe fundamentals when it comes to the right of privacy in America. We \nwant to be safe in America but not at the cost of our freedom. That, \nunfortunately, has become an issue because of these most recent \ndisclosures.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I remain baffled by the failure today to \nmove forward with the PATRIOT Act. That piece of legislation is \nexceedingly important. We know for an absolute fact, as Senator Kyl and \nothers have pointed out, that terrorist organizations and their \nmovements and activities were not properly discovered by law \nenforcement because of a failure to share information and other \nrestrictions that fell on those investigators. That has been \ndemonstrated with clarity. In fact, some say had we not had the wall \nbetween the CIA and the FBI and they could actually have shared \ninformation, we may have even prevented 9/11.\n  I say this to my friends in this country. Federal agents follow the \nlaw. The law said the CIA, which is out dealing with international \nterrorist groups and others who want to harm the United States, and the \nFBI, which is given the responsibility of homeland protection and crime \nenforcement in this country,\n\n[[Page S13740]]\n\nwere not allowed to share information. And they did not do so. It was \npart of a governmental reform. I think the Frank Church committee \nthought they were doing something good, but they ended up creating a \nwall that prohibited the sharing of information that made it far more \ndifficult for Federal investigators to do the job we pay them to do.\n\n  This afternoon, I saw a lady from New York who was touched by 9/11. \nShe wants this bill passed. As a matter of fact, she was shocked that \nit was not. Why is she shocked? It just passed this Senate a few days \nago 100 to 0, by unanimous consent, not a rollcall vote, but unanimous \nconsent, without an objection. It came out of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, 18 to 0. We have a host of libertarians on that committee--\ncivil libertarians and libertarians. Chairman Specter is very proud of \nhis heritage of civil liberties. All of us take it seriously in that \ncommittee, and it came out unanimously.\n  The bill went to the House, and they passed this very bill that we \njust blocked. The House passed it with a 75-vote majority even though, \nin fact, the House had to recede and give about 80 percent of the \ndifferences in the House and Senate bill over to the Senate side. The \nSenate bill was clearly the bill that was the model for the legislation \non which we finally voted.\n  So we go over to the House. They have some provisions and we have \nsome provisions and there is a good bit of discussion over the issues. \nFinally, a conference report is agreed to. It comes back over here, and \nall of a sudden we face a filibuster.\n  The PATRIOT Act will sunset December 31. It will be gone. We will not \nhave the provisions that are in it. Those provisions have played a big \nrole in helping us protect this country from another attack. Who would \nhave thought we would have gone over 4 years since 9/11 without another \nattack on this homeland? I hope no one thinks that success to date--\npraise our Creator--has not been driven in large part by effective law \nenforcement activities by the FBI, the CIA, and other agencies that are \ncharged with these responsibilities.\n  The compromises reached in the conference committee to work out the \ndifferences between the House and Senate bill, according to Chairman \nArlen Specter, tilted in favor of the Senate on the disputed provisions \nby about 80 percent. He said there is not a dime's worth of difference \nin terms of whether civil liberties were enhanced or not enhanced in \nthe bill that we just voted on and the one that came out of committee \n18 to 0 and passed the Senate unanimously.\n  So why would this Senate and the great Democratic Party, except for \ntwo of its members, vote to block us from an up-or- down vote on this? \nI don't understand. I think it is a serious matter.\n  There are provisions in the bill that are important. As I have tried \nto state, as a Federal prosecutor for 15 years nearly, I remain baffled \nby the concerns over the bill. I remain baffled because of the fact \nthat every provision in the bill has already been a part of Federal law \nat some point in time and had never been overruled or found \nunconstitutional. But many of the law enforcement capabilities that the \nbill delineates and makes clear and actually creates frameworks for \nalready exist in current law.\n  I knew from the beginning that there was nothing in the bill that was \ngoing to be held to be unconstitutional and, indeed, it has not because \nit was written in such a way that we would not violate the \nConstitution, and it would be within the principles of our commitment \nto civil liberties.\n  All of us are committed to civil liberties. One of our Senators, Mr. \nByrd, said we don't need search warrants written by FBI agents. \nAbsolutely we don't. We don't want an investigator being able to \nconduct a search of somebody without an independent order of a judge, \nand there is nothing in this bill that does that. We don't change the \ngreat protection that you have to have a court-approved search warrant, \nfor heaven's sake. There is nothing in this bill that comes close to \nthat. But these are the kinds of charges that have been made, upsetting \npeople and making them think there is something strange or overreaching \nabout this legislation. It passed with only one negative vote 4 years \nago, 90-something to 1.\n  We need to get our act together on this bill. I urge my colleagues to \nread the legislation that Senator Specter has so carefully written so \nthat anybody can understand what the complaints are, to consider what \nthe Department of Justice has said, to listen to the debate, and \nactually read the legislation. I am convinced that if colleagues would \ntake a moment to do so, they will find that all of our great liberties \nare protected and, in fact, we didn't give to FBI terrorist \ninvestigators the same powers an IRS investigator has this very day to \nsubpoena bank records that relate to a person who may not have paid \ntheir income tax. IRS agents can do that on a daily basis.\n  I see my colleague. Maybe I have already utilized over 10 minutes. If \nI have, I will be pleased to wrap up and yield the floor. I am over 10 \nminutes.\n\n  I feel strongly about this mainly because I am so concerned that \npeople have allowed this vote to become a vote on whether one believes \nin civil liberties or whether one believes in law enforcement.\n  The bill was written and came out of committee--Senator Leahy \napproved it; he monitored its passage from the beginning--so as not to \nviolate the Constitution, not to undermine our liberties, but to make \nsure that Federal investigators who are trying to keep another 9/11 \nfrom happening here have the same powers as IRS agents. And, indeed, we \ndidn't even give them that much power, in many instances. They still \nhave less in some instances.\n  We need to get our act together on this legislation. We need to move \nthis bill. I don't think it needs to be any weaker. If we come back and \nwater it down and pass it, it would be a mistake.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nOregon is recognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I would like to let the Senator from \nGeorgia propound a unanimous consent request first.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oregon. I ask \nunanimous consent that I be recognized to speak following the speech of \nSenator Wyden from Oregon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                     Stopping Indecent Programming\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, as the session winds down this year, I \nwanted to take a few minutes and bring to the attention of the Senate a \nnew development that I think will be of great interest to millions of \nparents and families across the country. As the distinguished President \nof the Senate knows from our service in the other body, parents are \ngreatly concerned that their children are bombarded every day with \nobscene, indecent, profane, and violent entertainment on television. \nParents come up to us as legislators and say: What are you going to do \nto stop this trash? What are you going to do to keep indecent \nprogramming away from our children's eyes and ears?\n  Of course, we all wish for an ideal world where parents would take \nthe most direct action, which is simply to turn the television set off. \nThat is something that can be done without any Government role. But \nwith parents working--and very often both parents working two jobs each \nto try to make ends meet--that is not always possible.\n  So as I began to look at how to solve the indecency problem, I asked \nwhat could the Government do in this area to better protect our kids \nfrom indecent programming on television? I also asked how to do it in a \nway without a big government bureaucracy program, a one-size-fits-all \napproach or where the Federal Government would regulate the actual \ncontent of the programs on our television sets.\n  As I began the search to try to figure out a responsible approach to \nthe problem of indecent programming for children, one of the things I \nfound is one of the cable companies and the big television programmers \nhave set up a special tier of programming for those people who are \ninterested in sports and those people who are interested in movies. I \nlooked at it and found that not only had cable companies done this, it \nseemed to be working as well.\n\n[[Page S13741]]\n\nThey found a way to do it that the subscribers like and which was \nprofitable. I said to myself, if that kind of approach works for sports \nfans and movie fans, why can we not do it for families as well? Why can \nwe not have a special tier of programming that is appropriate for \nchildren and works for families, the way we have special programming \nfor sports and movies?\n  So earlier in this session, I introduced the Kid Friendly TV \nProgramming Act, which would require all video service providers to \nimplement a tier of television programming that is appropriate for \nchildren. In my bill, a kids' tier is defined as a group of 15 or more \ntelevision stations blocked off in a separate channel area with both \nprogramming and commercials on it that are purely kid friendly. Parents \nwould be able to subscribe to this block of stations separate from \ntheir regular programming, knowing the programming on their television \nwill not carry material that is obscene, indecent, profane, sexual, or \ngratuitously violent. In introducing this legislation, it seemed to hit \nthe criteria that were most important to me: more wholesome choices for \nparents and families but not a one-size-fits-all Government mandate. \nThe Government would put the focus where it ought to be, which is to \ngive parents a block or tier of channels separate from regular \nprogramming where there would not be material inappropriate for our \nchildren.\n  After I introduced the legislation, Chairman Stevens and the ranking \nminority member Senator Inouye of the Commerce Committee, also made an \nimportant effort in holding a roundtable discussion on the problem of \nindecency, which provided some very valuable exposure for the issue. I \nwant to express my appreciation to both of them for their leadership on \nthis matter.\n  I also want to express my appreciation to the chairman of the Federal \nCommunications Commission, Kevin Martin, who has discussed this issue \nwith me on a number of occasions. He gave a great boost to this effort \nseveral weeks ago at the forum that was held on indecent programming, \nwhere he came out and said that a kids' tier of programming would be a \nresponsible, practical way to make sure our Nation's children had more \nwholesome choices on television.\n  This week, spurred on by the legislation, the work of Chairman \nMartin, and the good bipartisan work done by Senator Stevens and \nSenator Inouye, the cable industry took a small step in the right \ndirection when six cable companies, including Time Warner and Comcast, \nannounced they plan to offer a kids' tier of programming in 2006.\n  Having listened for months to arguments that kids' tier is not going \nto be profitable and it is not going to be practical, we saw the \nindustry finally come to an understanding that it was time to get \nserious about this problem.\n  Yesterday, Time Warner released the details of their kids' tier \noffer. I was pleased to see that their proposal included G-rated \nstations that run child friendly content 24 hours a day. However, it is \nunclear what will be included in the package that parents must purchase \nin order to purchase the kids' tier. Parents still may have to \nsubscribe to a tier that includes stations that carry foul language, \nexcessive violence, and inappropriate sexual content in order to \nsubscribe to the kids' tier.\n  That is not what my legislation called for at all. It said we had to \nhave alternatives to the kind of inappropriate programming that is out \nthere now. But in order to subscribe to Time Warner's kids' tier, \nfamilies might also have to subscribe to service which could include \ninappropriate programming for children.\n  I am pleased I can say on the Senate floor that at least some people \nin the industry have recognized the need for a kids' tier of cable \nprogramming across our country. For a long time, whenever I brought \nthis up, they basically said western civilization would end if we have \nthis kind of programming that meets the needs of parents and families. \nAt least we have seen baby steps to address this issue.\n  What is needed is not different than what parents have at the candy-\nfree checkout lane at the supermarket. Just like parents should not \nhave to take their kids past all the candy to check out at the grocery \nstore, parents should not be forced to surf through obscene programs in \norder to get to the programs for kids that are appropriate.\n  In the days ahead I want to make sure that children across the \ncountry have an opportunity to have access to this kind of good quality \nprogramming, that the kids' tier is implemented properly, and that it \ndoes not depend on which community one is in. While a family in \nCorvallis or Portland in my home State would have a kids' tier \navailable to them because they are served by Comcast, a family in \nPendleton or Hood River would not because they receive their cable \nthrough a different company. Until all video service providers are \noffering a kids' tier the job will be incomplete.\n  My legislation requires that all video service providers institute a \nkids' tier. I want to make sure families get this option. It is my \nintent to watch the developments we have seen in the last couple of \nweeks with respect to Time Warner and Comcast very closely. I am very \nappreciative of what Chairman Martin has done in this area because he \nhas given great visibility to the question of improving children's \nprogramming.\n  I see Senator Pryor is in the Chamber as well. He has done excellent \nwork on the Commerce Committee on this issue of indecent programming \nfor children.\n  If we do not see this kind of tier of kid friendly programming done \nright across this country, I am going to come back to the Senate and \npush for my original legislation. The private sector has taken baby \nsteps in the right direction, but there is still a great deal left to \ndo. With millions of kids being exposed to indecent, profane, and \nviolent programming, it is important to do this job right, and the \nSenate ought to stay at it on a bipartisan basis until it is done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nGeorgia is recognized.\n\n\n                              The Tax Code\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, today is an anniversary of a day of great \nrenown in American history. Two hundred and thirty-two years ago, on \nDecember 16, 1773, a band of colonists boarded three ships in Boston \nHarbor, dumped the cargo of tea into that harbor, and it became known \nas the Boston Tea Party. It was a protest of taxation without \nrepresentation in that great injustice.\n  I rise today on the floor of the Senate to tell you that injustice \nstill exists in our tax system, not in taxation without representation \nbut in the complexity of our system. Think about it for just a second. \nIt takes the average American filing the simplest form, 1040, 13 hours, \nthe length of 6 college basketball games, just to fill out our simplest \nform. It takes 3 of 5 Americans the cost of hiring an outside \naccountant to consult with them just to meet the demands of the current \ntax system. It means the Tax Code is now 1,685,000 words long, which is \nexactly 380 times the number of words in the entire Constitution of the \nUnited States of America. As all of us on the floor of the Senate know, \nin months, 17 million more Americans will be brought under the \nalternative minimum tax, a tax that was allegedly started only to \naddress the taxation of a few that now addresses the taxation of the \nmany.\n  Earlier today, I introduced legislation to deal with this injustice \nand create a mechanism for us to forthrightly come before the people of \nthe United States and develop a simpler, fairer, and flatter system of \ntaxation. Simply put, we would sunset the current Tax Code on the \nFourth of July, 2008, and command the Congress to take the next 3 years \nanalyzing consumption taxes, progressive taxes, flat taxes, revenues of \nall sorts, and the effect each has on the economy and economic policy, \nand then come back to the American people prior to that date with a \nnew, simplified, fairer, flatter tax system, or, if failing to do so, \nthe Congress of the United States would then be forced to vote on this \nfloor to extend the existing system we have and all the injustice that \ngoes with it. Only by creating a deadline, only by being faced with the \ntermination and the loss of revenue would this Congress forthrightly \ntake the due diligence it needs to have the massive overhaul our system \nneeds.\n  Today, the United States of America in the 21st century is operating \nunder 20th century rules--1,685,000 words\n\n[[Page S13742]]\n\nwritten as long as 100 years ago, when we are looking forward to a \nfuture that is brighter and better for all Americans.\n  I urge my colleagues in the Senate to join me in cosponsoring this \nlegislation and for us to forthrightly set a time when we can truly \nhave a second tea party, this one liberating us from the injustice of \ncomplexity and opening the door for simplicity in the American tax \nsystem.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n\n\n                            Victory in Iraq\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on Iraq's \nstunning march toward freedom and democracy and America's efforts to \nsupport her progress. I believe, as does President Bush, that it is \nsquarely in our national security interest to help the Iraqis build a \nthriving and healthy democracy. Democracy is the ultimate antidote to \nterrorism.\n  We all know for democracy to flourish we must defeat the terrorists \nwho still linger in Iraq. The mission facing our country is simple: We \nmust defeat them by standing up the pillars of Iraq's democratic \ninstitutions so that country can become a hinge of freedom in the \ngreater Middle East.\n  We know the terrorists cannot defeat us on the battlefield; our \nmilitary might is absolutely unmatched. We know they cannot defeat our \nideas, because when people are given a choice, they will choose liberty \nand democracy over terror and tyranny every time.\n  So this debate turns on just one simple question: do we have the will \nto win in Iraq?\n  This summer, American intelligence forces intercepted a letter \nwritten by Ayman al-Zawahiri, one of the leaders of Al Qaeda, to Abu \nMusab al-Zarqawi, the leader of Al Qaeda in Iraq. In his letter, al-\nZawahiri said that al Qaeda's goal was quite clear: ``Expel the \nAmericans from Iraq.'' He went on to say this:\n\n     . . . [T]he mujahedeen['s] ongoing mission is to establish an \n     Islamic state, and defend it, and for every generation to \n     hand over the banner to the one after it until the Hour of \n     Resurrection . . . The Americans will exit soon, God willing.\n\n  So the terrorists' intent is plain. They are not only dedicated to \ndriving us out of Iraq, they are also dedicated to turning Iraq into a \nbreeding ground for terror and anarchy.\n  We must not let them succeed. That is why I am so concerned about the \ncomments of those who suggest that the battle in Iraq is unwinnable. \nWhat signal does that send to the terrorists? What signal does it send \nto our troops who are putting it on the line every day in Iraq?\n  Here is what Congressman Dennis Kucinich, a leader of the House \nDemocrats' ``Out of Iraq Caucus,'' said: ``It is time for a new \ndirection in Iraq, and that direction is out.'' It's pretty clear where \nhe stands. And he is not an outlier in his party.\n  The ``Out of Iraq Caucus'' is composed of about 70 Democratic House \nmembers. Their goal is America's complete withdrawal from Iraq. \nPersonally, I don't think it makes sense to set an arbitrary withdrawal \ndate, so the terrorists can circle that date on their calendars and \nwait for us to leave. It seems to me that the better course is to \ndetermine our troop needs based on military requirements on the ground, \nas determined by our military leaders.\n  House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi herself has endorsed the immediate \nwithdrawal of our troops from Iraq, and claims that her position \nrepresents the majority of her caucus. Leader Pelosi endorsed H.J. Res. \n73, a resolution that states:\n\n       The deployment of United States forces in Iraq, by \n     direction of Congress, is hereby terminated and the forces \n     involved are to be redeployed at the earliest practicable \n     date.\n\n  So that is the position of the House Democratic Leader, Ms. Pelosi.\n  Now, the chairman of the Democratic Party, Howard Dean, has said \nrecently the United States can't even win in Iraq. He says, ``The idea \nthat we're going to win this war is an idea that, unfortunately, is \njust plain wrong.''\n  Let me say that again. Howard Dean, the leader of the Democratic \nParty, believes that ``The idea that we're going to win this war is an \nidea that, unfortunately, is just plain wrong.\n  That is Howard Dean's assessment of the situation.\n  Chairman Dean later tried to qualify his comments about the \nunwinnable nature of the battle in Iraq, but no matter what he says \nnow, it still sounds like ``cut and run'' to me. If it is not ``cut and \nrun'' it is at least ``cut and jog.''\n  Let me be clear. Proponents of immediate withdrawal certainly have \nthe right to hold that view, and I believe they do so with patriotism \nin their hearts. But I must respectfully question their judgment.\n  Our goal should be to achieve victory in Iraq, not merely to pull out \nbased on an arbitrary date on the calendar.\n  The fact is, we are already on the road to victory in Iraq. The \ntransformation of Iraq from the tyrannical rule of Saddam Hussein to \nfreedom and democracy in just two and a half years is a remarkable \nsuccess story.\n  It took us 11 years in our country to get from the Declaration of \nIndependence to the Constitution. And freedom took another giant step \nforward yesterday with the elections for the first permanent democratic \ngovernment in Iraqi history.\n\n  Of course, the news we have now is still preliminary. But early news \nreports indicate that 11 million Iraqis went to the polls yesterday, \nonce again staining their fingers with indelible purple ink to signify \nthat they had voted.\n  That is an overall turnout rate of over 70 percent, compared to 60 \npercent here a year ago, which was a good turnout for us, higher than \nnormal--70 percent of them going to the polls, proudly holding up their \nink-stained fingers, many of them not certain they wouldn't be killed \nby exercising that right to vote. What is there not to admire about \nthat, an extraordinary performance on the part of the Iraqi people?\n  As I indicated, that turnout rate exceeds that of their previous \nelection, the constitutional referendum in October. And the turnout \nrate for that referendum exceeded the rate for the election prior to \nthat, for the interim government in January. Most important, turnout \namong Sunnis yesterday appears to have been particularly robust, as \nwith each election Sunnis have gotten more involved in the democratic \nprocess.\n  We may not know the results of the elections yet, but we know the \nIraqi people are the winners. They have repeatedly defied the \nterrorists by voting for democracy over tyranny. Yesterday's elections \nhave created a 275-member council of representatives, who will govern \nIraq with the consent of the people.\n  It is odd to me that at such a moment of triumph in that country, \nthere are still those who call for America to stop short. Granted, not \neverything in Iraq has gone just as we would have wanted it to.\n  Unfortunately, such is the nature of military conflict. We've all \nheard it said that no battle plan survives the first shot. But there \ncan be no doubt that tremendous progress has been made. Maybe it would \nbe a good idea to review the progress that has been made in Iraq in the \nlast two-and-a-half years.\n  Back during the Saddam Hussein era--when he was in power from 1979 to \n2003--in that period, over 4,000 political prisoners were summarily \nexecuted, 50,000 Kurds were killed, 395,000 people were forced to flee \nIraq, there were no free elections whatsoever, no free newspapers, and \nHussein, of course, stood above the law.\n  What has the situation been since 2003, since the fall of Saddam? \nIraqis are now innocent until proven guilty, and Saddam himself is \nbeing given a fair trial, something he gave no one.\n  Seventy-five Kurds were elected to the interim Parliament, when \nduring Saddam's regime, 50,000 of them were murdered. Over 270,000 \npeople repatriated, when during Saddam's regime, 395,000 people left \nthe country; 9.8 million Iraqis freely voted on the Constitution. There \nare over 100 free newspapers in Iraq. They have a robust free press \nthere, and Hussein, as I suggested earlier, is now on trial, being \ngiven the kind of trial he gave no one.\n  So much has improved, much is left to do, but now we are heading in \nthe right direction. Iraqis are feeling positive about the direction of \ntheir country as well. According to an ABC News study, 77 percent of \nIraqis think the security situation in the country will be better in a \nyear. Two-thirds of them expressed confidence in the Iraqi Army and the \nIraqi police.\n\n[[Page S13743]]\n\n  These people are on the ground in Iraq every day. They are living in \nthe midst of the war on terror. I think we should give their opinions \ngreat weight.\n  Look at all the progress that has been made. The 24-year reign of \nterror is over, and a new democratic, free Iraq is emerging. Voter \nturnout in their national elections yesterday was reportedly very \nheavy, as I indicated. So Iraqis are optimistic about their future. \nThey think the fight against the terrorists is worth fighting. They \nthink democracy is worth fighting for.\n  We should stand by them and do no less. We need to complete the job, \nand our strategy is to stay and win--not cut and run.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n\n            Tax Relief for Americans in Combat Act Extension\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I rise today to commend and thank my \ncolleagues for including a 1-year extension of the Tax Relief for \nAmericans in Combat Act as part of the Gulf Opportunity Zone Act of \n2005. This measure corrects a discrepancy in the Tax Code that \npenalizes certain service men and women serving in combat situations.\n  To give my colleagues a bit of history on this, in 2003, I approached \nthe distinguished chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Senator \nChuck Grassley, and the ranking member of that same committee, Senator \nMax Baucus, and asked them to join me in an effort to get a fresh look \nat the overall picture of how our Tax Code treats our military. I was \nvery pleased when they agreed to work with me, and was delighted to \njointly request an expedited study by the Government Accountability \nOffice. It was an honor for me to work with them. I also must say their \nstaff have been nothing but a delight to work with throughout this \nprocess.\n  The GAO made their study, and they had some interesting findings.\n  One of those findings was especially important and necessitated \nimmediate attention. In a nutshell, what they found is service men and \nwomen who were serving in combat zones and receiving nontaxable combat \npay were not able to also take advantage of the earned-income tax \ncredit and the childcare tax credit. Imagine that. The result was \nthousands of our men and women serving in combat--in places such as \nIraq, Afghanistan, and other places around the globe--were seeing a \nreduction or the elimination of their earned-income tax credit or child \ntax credit and, in effect, losing money. In other words, the Tax Code \nhas the impact of penalizing them for serving in combat.\n  The GAO report characterized this as an unintended consequence. I say \nit is plain wrong. I was pleased to introduce legislation to try to fix \nthis glitch. Back in 2004 we passed Tax Relief for Americans In Combat \nAct. The bill allowed men and women in uniform serving in combat to \ninclude combat pay for the purpose of calculating their earned-income \nand child tax credit benefits. In other words, they were able to \ncontinue receiving their rightful combat pay exclusions while also \nbeing able to take full advantage of other tax credits. However, what \nwe passed in 2004 expires at the end of this year. So I am pleased \ntoday's action in effect extends the legislation for one more year.\n  I thank, again, Senator Max Baucus for his leadership in helping \nextend it for another year. Also, I thank Senators John Kerry and \nBarack Obama for their leadership in taking up the fight when someone \nsaw the opportunity to do so, to ensure our men and women in combat are \nfairly treated.\n  The urgency of this situation is highlighted especially when you \nfocus on our troops whom it affects. We are talking about troops in \ncombat for more than 6 months. They are at lower pay grades and tend to \nbe married with children. They have little or no savings or spousal \nincome. The GAO suggested the amount of tax benefit loss could be up to \n$4,500 for enlisted personnel and $3,200 for officers. That is real \nmoney. That is make-or-break money for a lot of these people. They are \nalready under enormous stress.\n  I am glad we could come together in this bipartisan fashion and \nextend this for another year. The bill corrects the problem and lets \nour troops who are risking life and limb for us know that while they \nare away fighting for us, we are in the Senate fighting for them and \nfor their families.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I inquire of the Chair, are we on the \nPATRIOT Act or what is the order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct, we are currently on \nthe PATRIOT Act.\n  Mr. BURNS. I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to speak for up to 15 \nminutes--and I don't think it will be that much--as if in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                  Iraq\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I heard the words of our assistant leader \non the majority side and wanted to come to the Senate. These words may \nget lost in the swirl of the times with the holidays, but yesterday was \ntruly a historic time not only for the people of Iraq, but a historic \ntime for the peace process in the Middle East.\n  There was not a doubt in anyone's mind around the world what that was \nabout yesterday. They not only elected permanent representation in \ntheir government that will move on and try to finish their \nconstitution, but it was a symbol of a people who voted for peace, \nsecurity, and a new economic future. That is what that was all about \nyesterday.\n  I congratulate the people of Iraq who, with a great deal of courage, \nturned out and stood in lines and voted their will. This is what this \nwhole exercise has been about.\n  I leave a message with not only this Congress but to some who fail to \nsee how much hope was on display yesterday: there is hope for the \nfuture. Now we have little girls going to school in Iraq. Hope for \nfamilies, that they can participate in a republican form of democracy, \nand to change the economic culture of those people who live in Iraq.\n  Think of the possibilities. The success in Iraq also has done another \nthing that will change not only Iraq, but it will change the whole \narea. For the first time since World War I there will be a \ntransportation and communication corridor that will change the economic \nculture from Tel Aviv to Kuwait City. Think of what that does. It puts \nAmman back on the trade route, so to speak. King Abdullah, the leader \nof Jordan, understands this. And as he looks at that, it puts Amman \nback on the trade route.\n\n  But what about the future? Anyone who has visited Iraq has seen this, \nprobably in Baghdad, or wherever. But I will tell you what this farm \nkid has seen on his visit to Iraq. When we were in Mosul we saw dry \nland, farming, good soil. There are two great rivers with irrigation \nsystems from both of them. I saw the kind of dirt it takes in which to \nbuild an economy.\n  Let's don't talk about gas or oil. Let's talk about the very industry \nthat contributes more to the GDP of any country in the world, and that \nis agriculture. They have the ability to be the breadbasket of the \nMiddle East. As you know, most of the Middle East is desert. Most of it \nhas soil that is very thin, and there are not many nutrients in it. And \neven where you find those areas where they have it, it is in need of \nwater. Water isn't there.\n  I looked at the north of Israel one time, and I understood the \nproblem there. The problem there has to do with water, the ability to \nirrigate out of the Jordan River. You have two great river systems in \nIraq.\n  The next step in this budding new freedom is the cornerstone of \nfreedom, and that is land ownership, making people productive, growing \nrenewable resources, providing for your family, but also providing a \ngreat export out of Iraq and becoming a trading partner with their \nneighbors.\n  We cannot change the ethnic culture, nor can we change the Islamic \nculture, but we can change the economic culture to where more people of \nthat society participate in the economic well-\n\n[[Page S13744]]\n\nbeing of their country. Just think of the possibilities and the hope it \nbrings to the next generations of those folks.\n  If you can find something to export--and I will tell you, I look at \nJordan. There is a country that is not very wealthy. The only thing \nthey have to export is potash, and the world can only use so much \npotash.\n  But they understand communications and transportation. So there is \ngreat hope there now. There is the hope of land ownership, the hope of \nparticipation in supplying food and fiber not only for their own \npeople, but to export to other neighboring countries. That corridor is \nnow established with the free movement not only of people, but also \ngoods and services.\n  That corridor will widen. It will effect the way people do business \nin Syria and the way they do business in Iran. It will change even how \nthey do business in Egypt. The Nile Delta, a very fertile delta, now \nwill have some competition in the food business.\n  Also, it will have possibilities for our country when those economics \ntake hold. And it is not going to happen by next week, or next year, or \nmaybe not even for the next 5 years. But you are going to see it happen \nbecause of this taste of freedom, land ownership, independence, and to \nbe able to participate in their own government, and, yes, even in their \nown provincial governments.\n  So the possibilities of peace and stability and economic advancement \nhave never been greater than at any time in history since World War I. \nYet there will be those who say we should not be there helping freedom-\nloving people achieve the same dream, having the same hopes we have for \nour next generation, our children, and our grandchildren.\n  Hope is eternal. Now they have a future, a future they have never had \nsince almost 100 years ago. And the impact of that will spread \nthroughout the Middle East. It will happen. The Presiding Officer comes \nfrom an agricultural State with land ownership, productivity, and \nexports. My good friend from Iowa, my goodness; they are the \nbreadbasket of the world. They can grow more in Iowa with what falls \nout of their pocket accidentally than we can, on purpose, in Montana, I \nwill tell you. What a great and blessed State, and the same for the \nState of my friend from Texas, who is on the floor.\n  But what makes it operate is land ownership and participation in the \neconomy. Then the terrorists have nobody to recruit because there is \nhope.\n  Our Marines, our Army, and our Air Force paid a heavy price because \nthey, too, believe this legacy of freedom, to be passed on from one \ngeneration to another, is worth dying for.\n  I had a lady say: ``If you wanted to take a poll in Iraq, if you \npolled our military people, that poll would say they don't want to be \nthere.''\n  I said: Well, if you took a poll in the English Channel on June 6, \n1944, they didn't want to be there either. What was that for? Countries \nhad been overrun by a tyrant who brought nothing but tyranny. And they \nwere an enemy of this country and our ideals and our principles.\n  They have those principles already. But what they have too is hope. \nAnd we have to nurture that hope because they cannot only feed \nthemselves, with their renewables grown from Mother Earth, they can \nbecome a powerhouse in the Middle East for commerce. Just think of that \ncorridor. Just think of the possibilities of changing an economic \nculture that will run from Tel Aviv to Kuwait City, and then you tell \nme: Was it worth it?\n  This President understands a vision of hope for freedom-loving people \neverywhere. And what it offers to their citizens is beyond some folks' \ncomprehension. Freedom is not free. Hope is not free. There must be \nsacrifice.\n  Yesterday, those folks lined up by the droves to take advantage of \nchanging their lives, sending a strong message to the rest of the \nworld: Terrorists, you are not welcome here anymore.\n  That is the greatest enemy terrorists have, when the fires of freedom \nburn in the hearts of a people in a line where they stand, where they \nvote.\n  That is the vision I have for the Middle East. It is very clear. It \nis clear that with that reform comes land ownership, irrigation \nsystems, dry land farming, and participation in the world of commerce. \nNot only in that, but in goods and services also. Iraqis are a very \ntalented people, a people who have that fire of freedom in their heart. \nWe wish them well, and we stand beside them as that fledgling \ndemocracy, that republican form of government, gets its kick-start. And \nit really got a kick-start yesterday. We wish them well. We \ncongratulate them for their courage to stand up and be counted.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n           University of Northern Iowa Panthers Football Team\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I am here to congratulate the \nUniversity of Northern Iowa Panthers football team and wish them the \nbest of luck as they prepare to take on the Appalachian State \nMountaineers today at 8 p.m. in Chattanooga, TN, for the 1-AA national \nchampionship. This is truly a historic occasion, as this marks UNI's \nfirst appearance in the national championship contest. In addition, UNI \nhas the opportunity to be only the second Iowa NCAA school to win a \nnational title in football. Central College in Iowa won the 1974 \ndivision III championship.\n  This has been a season full of highs and lows for the Panthers. \nStarting the season at 4 and 3, the outlook looked kind of bleak, but \nthe team did not get discouraged. They did not give up. Instead, they \nrattled off seven straight wins. As a result of their tenacity and \ndetermination, the Panthers find themselves tonight in the championship \ngame.\n  In 5 years, head coach Mark Farley has won 44 games, at least a share \nof three conference championships, and he has led the Panthers to three \nplayoff appearances. Under his leadership, the Panthers have again \nbecome a national power in 1-AA football. And Coach Farley is a \ngraduate of UNI. He was a member of the first UNI football team to play \nin the national semifinals. Twenty years later, after 10 playoff \nappearances and 5 semifinal appearances, he has led his alma mater to \ntheir first championship game.\n  Yesterday, the Des Moines Register ran a story titled ``Panther \nFootball A to Z.'' The article tells the story of the team's season, \nbeginning with the letter A for adversity. As I mentioned, the Panthers \nrecord stood at 4 to 3, but after seven consecutive wins, which \nincluded five late-game comebacks, they have earned the trip to \nChattanooga and the adoration of their fans. Much as linebacker John \nHerman stated in the article:\n\n       Text messages, e-mails, phone calls--it's crazy to see how \n     many people are excited for us to get here.\n\n  The article concludes with the letter Z for zenith by quoting \nathletic director Rick Hartzell, who said:\n\n       There's never been a better time to be a Panther.\n\n  I congratulate the young men, their coaches, and the University of \nNorthern Iowa for their tremendous season and wish them the best of \nluck tonight. I will be watching on ESPN2.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Des Moines Register \narticle be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I see my friend, Richard Burr, the \noutstanding Senator from North Carolina, on the floor. North Carolina, \nof course, is the home State of that great school, Appalachian State. I \nknow that after their defeat tonight under the paws of the Panthers, it \nwill continue to be a great school and a great football team.\n  My good friend and I have made a little wager on the game tonight: \nsix North Carolina pork chops versus six Iowa pork chops. You see, I \nsay to my friend, just as Iowa is No. 1 in pork production, and North \nCarolina is No. 2 in pork production, after tonight, Iowa will be No. 1 \nin 1-AA football, and North Carolina will be No. 2 in 1-AA football.\n  So, again, I look forward to dining on those great North Carolina \npork chops.\n\n[[Page S13745]]\n\nI ask my friend, please, would you throw in some of that North Carolina \nbarbecue sauce with them?\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n             [From the Des Moines Register, Dec. 14, 2005]\n\n                        Panther Football A to Z\n\n                             (By Rob Gray)\n\n       Chattanooga, TN.--It's hard to describe, let alone explain.\n       Northern Iowa's stunning run from NCAA Division I-AA \n     football playoff longshot to championship game participant \n     ends Friday with a first-ever title hanging in the balance. \n     Only Appalachian State stands in the way.\n       ``I'm sure after the season's over I'm really going to be \n     kind of in awe, but right now we're trying to get focused on \n     the game, trying not to get caught up in the moment,'' said \n     Panther quarterback Eric Sanders. ``But in the offseason, I \n     know I'm going to reflect and be pretty proud and go like, \n     `Wow. This really did happen.' ''\n       The No. 7 Panthers' transcendence of high-profile injuries, \n     daunting fourth-quarter deficits and taxing road trips may \n     defy logic, but it can be loosely quantified, or \n     encapsulated, within a quick spin through the alphabet. So \n     it's on to Chattanooga, via the ABCs:\n       A is for Adversity. The Panthers (11-3) once stood 4-3, but \n     seven consecutive wins followed, including five late-game \n     comebacks, and overcoming obstacles has kindled adulation.\n       ``Text messages, e-mails, phone calls--it's crazy to see \n     how many people are excited for us to get here,'' linebacker \n     John Hermann said.\n       B is for Balance. Northern Iowa running back David Horne \n     has rushed for 1,039 yards and 16 touchdowns. Quarterback \n     Eric Sanders has thrown for 2,748 yards and 23 touchdowns.\n       C is for Coaching. Mark Farley suffered along with \n     teammates and fellow coaches in five Panther losses in the \n     semifinals. This season, he helped orchestrate a \n     breakthrough. ``We've got the opportunity to represent our \n     school, but also our state,'' Farley said.\n       D is for Defensive ends. Appalachian State (11-3) features \n     two standouts at the position. Jason Hunter and Marques \n     Murrell have combined for 22 sacks.\n       E is for Extra credit. Northern Iowa kicker Brian Wingert \n     has drilled three consecutive game-winners.\n       F is for Finish. The Panthers have outscored foes, 63-14, \n     in the fourth quarter over their seven-game win streak.\n       G is for Grounded. Northern Iowa's defense has allowed big \n     games from highly rated quarterbacks Erik Meyer, Ricky Santos \n     and Barrick Nealy in the postseason, but kept them from \n     winning.\n       H is for History. Both Northern Iowa and Appalachian State \n     make their first title-game appearances.\n       I is for Interception. Matt Tharp's pick of Nealy preserved \n     Friday's 40-37 overtime win at Texas State.\n       ``(He) made a good play with a cast on his hand,'' fellow \n     defensive back Tanner Varner said. ``It was just amazing.''\n       J is for Jeff Bates. The Indianola senior center eased into \n     the starting role when offensive line anchor John Schabilion \n     suffered a season-ending injury.\n       K is for Krystal. Fans traveling to Chattanooga will \n     encounter this southern version of White Castle.\n       L is for Linebackers. Northern Iowa's Darin Heideman and \n     Brett Koebcke highlight a defense that gets stingy at \n     precisely the right moment. Koebcke is questionable for \n     Friday, though, with a high ankle sprain.\n       M is for Mountaineers. As in Appalachian State's nickname. \n     The team has lost just once to a I-AA opponent this season.\n       N is for National. ESPN2 will broadcast a Panthers football \n     game to a coast-to-coast audience for the second consecutive \n     week.\n       0 is for Overtime. The Panthers stand 2-0 in overtime \n     games, beating Western Kentucky, 23-20, in double overtime \n     and Texas State. ``We've definitely caught some breaks to be \n     at this point, but you kind of have to to get this far,'' \n     Sanders said.\n       P is for Pecan Bowl. Way back in 1964, the Panthers won \n     this Division II bowl game, 19-17, over Lamar Tech at \n     Abilene, Texas.\n       Q is for Quarterback(s). As usual, the Panthers will face a \n     good one--whether it be Richie Williams, who could be out \n     with a ruptured ligament, or backup Trey Elder, who led the \n     Mountaineers to last week's 29-23 win over Furman.\n       R is for Receivers. Justin Surrency leads the Panthers with \n     seven touchdown catches--including an end-zone grab in four \n     consecutive games. Patrick Hunter and Jamie Goodwin furnish \n     downfield speed. Brian Cutright excels at tight end.\n       ``There's no doubt in this team at any time,'' Cutright \n     said. (see item ``A'')\n       S is for Kevin Stensrud. The defensive lineman form Lake \n     Mills has battled countless injuries to reach his final game.\n       T is for Two-point conversion. Surrency's leaping catch to \n     tie the game at Texas State came amid three defenders. ``I \n     had just enough height on it, and not just enough height on \n     it to get it over the first guy and in between the other two \n     guys,'' Sanders said of the pass.\n       U is for Upsets. Northern Iowa has topped three teams this \n     season ranked No. 1 at some point--with two wins on the road.\n       V is for Variety. Sanders has hit nine or more receivers in \n     five of the past seven wins.\n       W is for Waffle House. This franchise dots the Tennessee \n     landscape like Casey's General Stores in Iowa.\n       X is for X-Factor. Jason Breeland provides a spark in the \n     Panther backfield and at wideout.\n       Y is for Yards. Expect plenty. The Panthers average 444 \n     yards in the playoffs; the Mountaineers average 437.\n       Z is for Zenith. As athletic director Rick Hartzell said, \n     there's never been a better time to be a Panther.\n       ``For our type of institution, we've got the best athletic \n     program in the country,'' he said.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, we will learn tonight that being No. 1 \ndoesn't mean that you win, and being the largest doesn't mean you are \nthe best. In fact, North Carolina pork chops are better than Iowa pork \nchops, and North Carolina football is, in most cases, as good if not \nbetter than Iowa football.\n  I commend the Northern Iowa Panthers. They have had a miraculous \nseason. They deserve to be in the championship game based on how they \nperformed in the second half of the season.\n  Appalachian State was ranked fifth by the Sporting News and fourth by \nESPN/USA Today in the I-AA polls. Appalachian has a record of 11-3, and \nthey have reached the I-AA semifinals now for the third time. They did \nit in 1987, 2000, and now in 2005. But they have never reached the \nchampionship game until this year.\n  This is a magical year for Appalachian State. Over 10,000 of my \nconstituents will make the trek today to Chattanooga, TN, for tonight's \nfootball game. I remind my good friend, Senator Harkin, that almost all \nof the tickets turned back in by the Northern Iowa Panthers were \npurchased by North Carolina constituents who will be at that game.\n  Appalachian State advanced to the championship game with a 29-23 \nvictory over rival Furman University. Appalachian took the lead with 2 \nminutes 17 seconds left, with an 11-play, 67-yard drive led by backup \nquarterback Trey Elder, who was filling in for a starting quarterback \nRitchie Williams. They held off a last-minute threat and picked up a \nfumble by Furman and ran it back to Furman's 1-yard line, where that \ngame ended.\n  Two of the team's three losses were to I-A teams--Kansas University \nand the tenth-ranked LSU Tigers. The Charlotte Observer named the \nMountaineers the most successful college football program in the State \nover the past 20 years.\n  Among their famous alumni are Dallas Cowboys linebacker Dexter \nCoakley, and former Redskins runningback John Settles.\n  Coach Jerry Moore is the winningest coach in Southern Conference \nhistory, with a string of 16 winning seasons in 17 years, with a record \nof 139-67. This is his 13th playoff appearance as a head coach. Coach \nMoore perfected his coaching skills as an assistant under our colleague \nin the House, Congressman Tom Osborne.\n  When Appalachian wins tonight's showdown, it will be the first time a \nuniversity from the State of North Carolina has ever won a national \nfootball championship.\n  Senator Harkin doesn't need to take my word for it or the sports \nreporters or the commentators opining on the success of Coach Moore and \nhis Mountaineers. Senator Harkin needs to go no further than his own \nbackyard to find someone who can attest to Jerry Moore's ability to \nprepare the Mountaineers for tonight's game. That is because Coach \nMoore counts as one of his closest friends a man synonymous with Iowa \nfootball--former Hawkeyes head coach, Hayden Fry, with whom Jerry Moore \nstarted his coaching career at SMU.\n  Mr. President, Appalachian State University was started as a teachers \ncollege in 1899. Its enrollment is slightly over 14,000 students. It is \nthe sixth largest State university in our university system in North \nCarolina. It has one of the highest graduation rates of student athlete \nfootball players in the State, and a few years ago it ranked only \nbehind Duke in that distinction.\n  I take this opportunity to congratulate the Northern Iowa Panthers. I \ncongratulate Chancellor Peacock and Coach Moore but, more importantly, \nthese two teams who have reached the final championship game tonight.\n  Tonight there will be only winners; there are no losers. Tomorrow \nthere\n\n[[Page S13746]]\n\nwill be one loser, and that will be my colleague from Iowa as he \nprepares to send those pork chops to North Carolina.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Cord Blood Legislation\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, yesterday afternoon, the majority leader \noffered a unanimous consent request to take up and pass, without any \namendments or any further action, H.R. 2520, a bill to collect cord \nblood for use in therapies for various kinds of blood diseases. I \nobjected to that unanimous consent request after quite a bit of talk on \nthe floor.\n  As I explained yesterday, I support this bill. I am a cosponsor of \nthis bill. In fact, I joined with Senator Specter 2 years ago to create \nthe National Cord Blood Stem Cell Banking Program by including $10 \nmillion for that purpose in the fiscal year 2004 Labor, Health and \nHuman Services, and Education appropriations bill, of which I am \nranking member. We have been funding that program ever since. So I have \nbeen in the lead in championing cord blood therapies by getting the \nprogram funded and keeping it funded.\n  Nevertheless, I objected to the unanimous consent request because I \nbelieve the Senate should take up the cord blood bill at the same time \nwe take up H.R. 810, which is the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act.\n  That is what the House did, and that is what the House passed. The \nHouse approved both these bills on May 24 of this year, and we have \nbeen waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting in the Senate to do \nthe same thing. We keep hearing from the majority leader that he wants \nto bring up H.R. 810. In fact, in what I thought was a very courageous \nspeech the majority leader gave on July 29, he said he would vote for \nH.R. 810. But we can't seem to bring it up on the Senate floor.\n  Members on the Republican side keep coming up with new bills to try \nto confuse things. They want to vote on five or six or seven bills, \nsome of which have absolutely nothing to do with stem cell research.\n  So a number of us on both sides of the aisle formed a bipartisan \ngroup to do what we could to try to bring both these bills, the same \ntwo the House passed, H.R. 810 and H.R. 2520, and do what the House \ndid--bring them up, debate them, and pass them.\n  When this unanimous consent request was then offered by the majority \nleader yesterday, I was on the floor. I had not checked with all the \nother people who had been involved in that effort, so I objected \nbecause I felt strongly that the two ought to be together.\n  I said to the majority leader last night that I would take a look at \nit today and go over it with my staff. I have decided, after going over \nit and looking at it, to lift my hold--I can only speak for myself--but \nI have decided to lift my hold on H.R. 2520.\n  One of the reasons I am doing so is because, quite frankly, the bill \ndoesn't accomplish anything that we are not already doing or about to \ndo. In 2002, under the direction of the Appropriations Subcommittee on \nLabor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies, of \nwhich I am ranking member and Senator Specter is the chair, the \nregistry on bone marrow units had to start including cord blood units \nas well.\n  Last year, there was a 24-percent increase in the number of cord \nblood units in the registry. This is because Senator Specter and I put \nthis in the bill in 2003. Then, in fiscal year 2004, I helped secure \n$10 million to create the National Cord Blood Stem Cell Banking \nProgram. Our subcommittee has appropriated $19.8 million in the last 2 \nyears for that effort. That is for the banking of cord blood.\n  Yesterday, my colleague from Kansas, Senator Brownback, said that \n``more kids will die if we don't take up the cord blood bill.'' That is \nsimply not true. Cord blood units are being collected and saving lives \nas we speak today because of the funding that we appropriated through \nthe Labor, Health and Human Services, Education appropriations \nsubcommittee. Let's be clear, that money is there. We appropriated it. \nIt is doing its job right now.\n  What will help save lives and help with cord blood is if Republican \nconservatives would stop cutting funding for the National Cord Blood \nStem Cell Banking Program that we put in a couple of years ago.\n  In the Senate version of the fiscal year 2006 Labor-Health and Human \nServices appropriations bill, under the leadership of Senator Specter, \nwe included $9.9 million for cord blood banking. To hear the talk last \nnight, one would think we didn't have any money. We put $9.9 million in \nthe bill. Guess what. The House had zero. The conference committee cut \nour $9.9 million down to $4 million. That means 3,900 fewer units of \ncord blood will be collected under the fiscal year 2006 appropriations \nbill than in last year's bill.\n  I would hope my good friend from Kansas will come to the floor and \nimplore his colleagues not to go along with the Labor-Health and Human \nServices appropriations bill and get that money back in there, but I \ndidn't hear anything said about that.\n  The cuts to cord blood banking do not stop at the $4 million level. \nWe are told that when the DOD appropriations bill comes back, there \nwill be a 1-percent, across-the-board cut for every Federal program. \nFirst, the cord blood funding is cut from $9.9 million to $4 million. \nNow, it is going to get another 1-percent cut for good measure.\n  As I said, if Senators want to do more for cord blood banking, they \nought to increase the funding, at least not cut it in the Labor-Health \nand Human Services appropriations bill. But it is being cut. It \nshouldn't be cut. We put the money in there. So if my colleagues feel \nstrongly about banking cord blood and using that cord blood to save \nlives, they ought to be out here demanding that we not cut it from what \nwe put in the Senate bill. But I have not heard one person come on the \nfloor and take that up and say: No, we are not going to agree to those \ncuts.\n  If Senators want to do more for cord blood banking, they should \nincrease the funding, not cut it. But if Senators want to go ahead and \npass H.R. 2520, fine, I have no problem with that. There is no harm in \npassing language that authorizes work that is already being done by the \nAppropriations Committee. At least Senators who come out and talk at \nleast ought to thank Senator Specter for taking the lead on this.\n  There is another reason why I am lifting my hold. When we debate H.R. \n810 next year--let me put it this way. The majority leader has kept \nsaying he wants to make sure we bring up H.R. 810.\n  Senator Hatch from Utah said we are going to bring up H.R. 810. We \nare going to have that debate; we are going to vote on it. Well, when \nwe bring it up next year and debate it, it will be crystal clear who \nsupports medical research and who does not. The question will be very \nsimple: Are my colleagues for stem cell research or are they not?\n  Cord blood transplants, while enormously beneficial to people with \ncertain blood diseases, are no substitute for embryonic stem cell \nresearch. Cord blood cannot do a thing for people with Parkinson's, \nALS, juvenile diabetes, Alzheimer's. These are the things we can \naddress with embryonic stem cell research.\n  So I wanted to make it very clear today, No. 1, that I have taken off \nmy hold on the unanimous consent. They want to bring it out again. \nSecondly, Senator Specter and I have taken steps in the Appropriations \nCommittee both to put the money in there but also to set up the \nregistry. We have already set up the registry. There was some talk \nyesterday that maybe there is not a registry out there. Of course there \nis a registry. As I said, it went up 24 percent last year.\n  H.R. 2520 basically authorizes what we are already doing, anyway. \nThat is fine. But I implore my colleagues who are interested in this, \nas I am, come out and talk about the funding. Talk about the 3,900 \nfewer babies, young people, who will not get cord blood because of the \ncut in funding from $9.9 million now to less than $4 million. Let us \nhear some talk about that rather than being here and passing an \nauthorizing bill, which does not do one single\n\n[[Page S13747]]\n\nthing more than what we are doing already.\n  What it does is make sure the funding is there for the registry and \nto collect the cord blood and to bank it so that people and young \npeople who have these terrible diseases can get the cord blood to help \nthem.\n  I hope we do not make these cuts in the Labor-HHS appropriations \nbill. It is there, but we should not cut it. And if they do, I will \nhave more to say about it next year when we return in January and \nFebruary. I hope we can bring up H.R. 810, have a good debate on it, \nand let us vote it up or down, as the House did, and send it on to the \nPresident so we can get on with the vital research that is needed on \nembryonic stem cell research.\n  I conclude with this: There are some stories in the paper today--\nthere were a few yesterday--a front-page story today about a South \nKorean research doctor and the fact that he may have--I do not know all \nthe facts--falsified some stem cell lines. There are indications, at \nleast in my reading of the medical journal, there is some reason to \nbelieve he actually did do that, that it was falsified. Then I heard \nsome comments such as, well, see, there is the problem with stem cell \nresearch.\n  That points out the necessity for us to authorize it, to have the \nNational Institutes of Health supervise it, have jurisdiction over it, \nso that it is done in an ethical way, where we can monitor it and make \nsure we do not have rogue elements riding off doing their own thing, so \nwe have standards by which we can measure stem cell research, so we can \nhave legitimate, ethical, moral guidelines which researchers can \nfollow, and we can know who is doing the legitimate good work and know \nwho the outliers are.\n  The fact that this story has come out today makes it even more \nimperative that we pass H.R. 810 and we have National Institutes of \nHealth jurisdiction oversight over this kind of research.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant Journal clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  Federal Trade Commission Nominations\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, in the final hours of this session of the \nSenate, the Senate is going to approve two nominees to the Federal \nTrade Commission. I take a few minutes tonight to describe why I want \nto be on record tonight against the nomination of both these \nindividuals.\n  When it comes to energy, the Federal Trade Commission essentially is \nout of the consumer protection business. Well over a year ago, I \nreleased a report documenting the Federal Trade Commission's campaign \nof inaction when it comes to protecting our consumers at the gas pumps. \nMy report documented how the Federal Trade Commission has refused to \nchallenge oil industry mergers the Government Accountability Office \nsays would raise gas prices at the pump by 7 cents a gallon alone on \nthe west coast.\n  My report also documented how the Federal Trade Commission failed to \nact when refineries had been shut down or to stop anticompetitive \npractices such as redlining and zone pricing. Since then nothing has \nchanged.\n  Despite what we saw recently--record high prices for consumers, and \nrecord profits by major oil companies--what we have seen is a record \nlevel of inaction by the Federal Trade Commission on behalf of energy \nconsumers.\n  In the last few months, when we saw the price of gasoline soar to an \nall-time record high, the Federal Trade Commission was invisible. As \nfar as I can tell, the Federal Trade Commission failed to take any \naction at all in the wake of the hurricanes in the gulf that sent the \nprice of gas skyrocketing to over $3 a gallon across the country.\n  If you do a Google search on FTC and gasoline prices, nothing at all \ncomes up to indicate that the Federal Trade Commission has taken any \naction on behalf of energy consumers. What you do find are statements \nby the Chair of the Federal Trade Commission arguing against giving the \nagency additional authority to protect consumers against price gouging \nat the pump.\n  For example, the Federal Trade Commission Chair recently made the \nstatement opposing an effort here in the Senate to have a price gouging \nlaw because ``they are not simple to enforce and they could do more \nharm to consumers.''\n  The fact, however, is a number of States do have price gouging laws. \nTwo State attorneys general testified at a joint hearing recently here \nin the Senate that these laws are, in fact, beneficial.\n  In her testimony before a joint Senate hearing last month, the Chair \nof the Federal Trade Commission, Debra Majoras, described what I \nbelieve to be an astoundingly serious theory of consumer protection \nwhen she essentially said there is no need for a Federal price gouging \nlaw no matter how high the price of gasoline goes. The argument was by \nMs. Majoras that gasoline price gouging is a local issue even if the \nprice gouger is a major multinational oil company.\n  FTC officials also testified before the Congress that the agency has \nno authority to stop price gouging by individual companies.\n  Despite this clear gap in the agency's authority, the agency has \nrefused to say what additional authority it needs to go after price \ngouging, and others have pressed them to do for years.\n  There are unquestionable efforts in the private marketplace to \nexploit consumers, and it didn't start with Hurricane Katrina. As the \nWall Street Journal documented recently, gas prices for much of this \nrecent period have increased twice as fast as crude oil prices. \nClearly, a number of oil companies are not simply passing on higher \ncrude oil costs but are also adding substantial increases to the cost \nof gas above and beyond the higher cost of crude oil.\n  Since the early 1970s and for much of this year, there has never been \nthe kind of disparity between increases in the price of gas and \nincreases in the price of crude oil. This was not seen even in the days \nof the long gas lines following the OPEC embargo.\n  Over the past 30 years, gasoline prices never rose more than 5 \npercent higher in a year than the cost of crude increase. But in the \npast year, gas price increases outpaced crude by 36 percent. After \nHurricane Katrina, the price difference soared even higher to 68 \npercent.\n  Further evidence of price gouging could be found in what happened on \nthe west coast immediately following Hurricane Katrina, when prices \nsurged 15 cents per gallon overnight. For years, oil industry \nofficials, the Federal Trade Commission, and others have maintained \nthat the west coast was an isolated gasoline market from the rest of \nthe country. West coast supplies were not affected by the hurricanes. \nThe west coast gets almost none of its gas from the gulf. If the west \ncoast was an isolated market, as the oil industry has claimed for \nyears, then Katrina was not a justification for jacking up gas prices \non the west coast immediately after the hurricanes.\n  The Federal Trade Commission is the principal consumer protection \nagency in the Government. It is the Federal agency that can and should \ntake action when gasoline markets go haywire as they did after the \nhurricanes. But instead of action, what we have repeatedly seen were \nexcuses.\n  In the past, the Federal Trade Commission often claimed that it was \nstudying the problem or monitoring the gasoline markets as an excuse \nfor inaction on gas pricing.\n  Recently, the Federal Trade Commission's campaign of inaction has \neven extended to the studies that the agency does. The Federal Trade \nCommission chair testified last week that a study of gas price gouging \nthat Congress required the FTC to complete by this month would not be \nready until next spring. In effect, the campaign of inaction is now \napproaching the point of paralysis where the agency won't even deliver \npromptly on commitments that it has made to study the issue.\n  The agency has continued its program with inaction on behalf of \ngasoline consumers despite the findings by the Government \nAccountability Office that the agency's policies are raising prices at \nthe pump.\n  In May of 2004 the Government Accountability Office released a major \nstudy showing how oil industry mergers and the Federal Trade Commission\n\n[[Page S13748]]\n\nallowed to go through in the 1990s substantially increased \nconcentration in the oil industry and increased gas prices for \nconsumers by as much as 7 cents per gallon on the west coast.\n  Specifically, the Government Accountability Office found that during \nthe 1990s the Federal Trade Commission allowed a wave of oil industry \nmergers to proceed, that these mergers had substantially increased \nconcentration in the oil industry, and that almost all of the largest \nof the oil industry mega mergers examined by the auditors each had \nincreased gasoline prices. Essentially, the Government Accountability \nOffice found that the Federal Trade Commission's policies on mergers \nhad permitted serial price gouging.\n  Two years ago, when current Federal Trade Commission Chair Deborah \nMajoras last came before the Senate for confirmation, I asked a \nresponse to the report done by the independent government auditor. \nDespite her promise to do so, I have yet to receive any response from \nthe Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission.\n  The Government Accountability Office is not alone in documenting how \nGovernment regulators have been missing in action when it comes to \nprotecting our consumers at the gas pump. Since 2001, oil industry \nmergers totalling more than $19 billion have gone unchallenged by the \nFederal Trade Commission, according to a recent article in Bloomberg \nNews. The article also reported that these unchecked mergers may have \ncontributed to the highest gasoline prices in the past 20 years.\n  According to the Federal Trade Commission's own records, the agency \nimposed no conditions on 28 of 33 oil mergers since 2001. You can see \nthe results of the Federal Trade Commission's inaction at gas stations \nin Oregon and across the country. Nationwide, the Government \nAccountability Office found between 1994 and 2002, gasoline market \nconcentration increased in all but four States. As a result of the \nGovernment's merger policies, 46 States now have gasoline markets with \nmoderate or high concentration, compared to only about half that just \n10 years ago.\n  The Federal Trade Commission, oil industry officials, and consumer \ngroups all agree in these concentrated markets oil companies do not \nneed to collude in order to raise prices. The Federal Trade \nCommission's former general counsel, William Kovacic, has said:\n\n       It may be possible in selected markets for individual firms \n     to unilaterally increase prices.\n\n  In other words, the Federal Trade Commission's general counsel \nbasically admitted that oil companies in these markets can price gouge \nwith impunity. Mr. Kovacic is one of the two nominees for the Federal \nTrade Commission who is now before the Senate.\n  Despite all of this evidence that gasoline markets around the country \nhave become more concentrated and that in these concentrated markets \nindividual firms can raise prices and extract monopoly profits, the \nFederal Trade Commission has failed to take effective action to check \noil industry mergers. In the vast majority of cases, the Federal Trade \nCommission took no action at all.\n  The Federal Trade Commission's inaction on oil mergers is once again \na front burner issue with the recent announcement that ConocoPhillips, \nan oil company formed from a series of mergers the Federal Trade \nCommission allowed, is acquiring Burlington Resources to create one of \nthe largest U.S. natural gas producers. Many in the oil and gas \nindustry expect this merger announcement will lead to a similar wave of \nconsolidation in the natural gas industry. This, in turn, will lead to \ngreater consolidation of the industry and fewer choices for consumers.\n  In addition to the inaction on merger issues, the Federal Trade \nCommission has also failed to act against proven areas of \nanticompetitive activity. Major oil companies are charging, in some \ninstances, dealers' discriminatory ``zone prices'' that make it \nimpossible for dealers to compete fairly with company-owned stations or \neven other dealers in the same geographic area. With zone pricing, one \noil company sells the same gas to its own brand stations at different \nprices. The cost to the oil company of making the gas is the same. In \nmany cases, the cost of delivering that gas to the service station is \nthe same, but the price the station pays is not the same. And the \nstation that pays the higher price is not able to compete, and \neventually that station goes out of business and there is further \nconcentration in that particular community's market.\n  Another example of anticompetitive practices that now occur in gas \nmarkets is a practice known as redlining. This involves oil companies \nmaking certain areas off limits to independent gas distributors, known \nas jobbers, who bring competition to a particular area. The Federal \nTrade Commission's own investigation of west coast gas markets found \nthat the practice of redlining was rampant on the west coast, but the \nFederal Trade Commission concluded that it could only take action to \nstop this anticompetitive practice if the redlining was the result of \nout and out collusion, a standard that is almost impossible to prove.\n  In my home State, one courageous gasoline dealer took on the major \noil companies and won a multimillion-dollar court judgment in a case \nthat involved redlining. This dealer gave the evidence that was used to \nwin his case in court to the Federal Trade Commission. The Federal \nTrade Commission, the premier consumer protection agency of the Federal \nGovernment, failed to do anything to help this dealer or to reign in \nthe anticompetitive practices at issue.\n  In areas other than energy, the Federal Trade Commission, in my view, \nhas made a significant contribution to protecting consumers. In other \nareas, the Federal Trade Commission has not hesitated to move \naggressively on behalf of the consuming public. To give one example, \nthe Federal Trade Commission created a Do Not Call Program to prevent \nconsumers from being hassled at home. With its Do Not Call Program, the \nagency pushed to protect consumers to the limits of its authority and \neven went beyond what the courts say it had authority to do.\n  For some reason, in the case of energy, the Federal Trade Commission \nhad a regulatory blind spot. That has been true, I am sad to report, in \nboth Democrat and Republican administrations. It is a bipartisan blind \nspot that keeps the agency from looking out for the millions of \nAmericans who consume gasoline and gas products every single day.\n  The Federal Trade Commission will not even speak out now on behalf of \nconsumers getting gouged at the gas pump. The agency will not use its \nbully pulpit to even say that record high gas prices are an issue of \nconcern that they will be looking at closely.\n  The FTC approach on gas prices is one, in my view, that must change. \nI do not intend to support the business-as-usual approach on energy \nthat has been seen too long at the Federal Trade Commission. I have met \nwith both the nominees to the Federal Trade Commission, Mr. William \nKovacic and Mr. Thomas Rosch. I also asked them to provide me their \nviews in writing in an effort to find out whether they would push the \nCommission to take a different approach from its long history of \ninaction in this area.\n  Unfortunately, neither of these individuals provided me with any \ncompelling evidence that they are committed to and will, in fact, work \naggressively to change the culture of inaction at the Federal Trade \nCommission with respect to consumer protection in the energy field.\n  Despite this prior statement about how oil companies with market \npower could gouge with impunity, Mr. Kovacic, the former Trade \nCommission general counsel, failed to identify any new authority the \nFederal Trade Commission needed to close the regulatory gap. On the \nquestion of whether the Federal Trade Commission needed added authority \nto address mergers in the petroleum industry that the GAO found had \nincreased gasoline prices, Mr. Kovacic wrote:\n\n       I do not have any specific preliminary in mind at the \n     moment.\n\n  Mr. Kovacic was more constructive on the question of whether there \nwere other ways the FTC's statutory authority might be enhanced. He \nsuggested Federal antitrust laws could be enhanced by encouraging \nwhistleblowers to reveal illegal conduct by adding qui tam mechanisms \nthat allow the whistleblowers to receive a percentage of\n\n[[Page S13749]]\n\nthe funds the government recovers from wrongdoers. I certainly agree a \nqui tam mechanism could provide a useful supplement to Government \noversight in many areas. It is not a substitute for the Federal Trade \nCommission doing its job. And Mr. Kovacic did not identify any way the \nFederal Trade Commission's own approach to the oil industry would \nchange. Given the Federal Trade Commission's record, given what they \nhave done in the last few years, essentially being AWOL when it comes \nto energy, Mr. Kovacic's proposal essentially amounts to contracting \nout the Federal Trade Commission's enforcement authority in this area.\n\n  Now, I personally believe that the Federal Trade Commission itself \nneeds to be an aggressive watchdog, looking out for consumers at the \ngas pump, not passively waiting for an industry whistleblower to come \nforward with smoking-gun evidence before taking action. That is why I \nfind, at this point, no evidence that Mr. Kovacic would bring a \ndifferent kind of outlook to the Federal Trade Commission's work in the \nenergy field.\n  Now, the other nominee, Mr. Rosch, had a more interesting proposal. \nHe suggests restoring the Federal Trade Commission's authority to \nchallenge unilateral conduct affecting competition, authority that the \nFederal Trade Commission had prior to 1994. That would be a good first \nstep toward closing the existing gap in the Agency's regulatory \nauthority.\n  Had Mr. Rosch ended his letter to me at that point, I would have been \nwilling to support his nomination. However, he went on to undercut his \ncase when it came to anticompetitive practices in a key area: zone \npricing. In effect, before taking any action to deal with this \nparticularly egregious and anticompetitive practice, Mr. Rosch argued \nfor waiting for the outcome of a pending court case and for \nrecommendations of the Antitrust Modernization Commission. So he was, \nin effect, saying, as the Federal Trade Commission says again and again \nand again in the energy field, that he wants more time to study, which \nmeans more delay and more inaction as it relates to protecting \nconsumers from anticompetitive practices.\n  It is my view that we have had enough delay and enough study when it \ncomes to the anticompetitive practices of the oil industry. I do not \nintend to support business as usual at the Agency, and I am not going \nto support business-as-usual nominees to be FTC Commissioners. I intend \nto continue to raise my concerns as long as the Federal Trade \nCommission continues to duck aggressive consumer protection efforts in \nan area that, for reasons that I cannot fully explain to the Senate, \nthey are simply unwilling to take up.\n  This Agency, which is willing to step in in a variety of areas, such \nas ``do not call,'' stretches their authority to the limits and then \neven beyond, for some reason continues to sit on their hands when it \nrelates to energy.\n  I want things to change at the Agency. I want to see a more \naggressive approach on behalf of energy consumers. I am not convinced \nthat anything will change if Mr. Kovacic or Mr. Rosch is appointed to \nthe Federal Trade Commission. Both of these individuals are going to \nget approved by the Senate in the last few hours of this session.\n  It is my hope, in wrapping up--I see the Senator from Pennsylvania on \nthe floor, who has patiently waited--it is my hope that these two \nindividuals, Mr. Rosch and Mr. Kovacic, will prove that I am incorrect \nin the judgments I make tonight. I hope they will be aggressive. I hope \nthey will look for opportunities to stand up for the consumer. I hope \nthey will change this course of inaction that has been laid out by Ms. \nMajoras. If those two individuals, Mr. Kovacic and Mr. Rosch, take \nthose kinds of steps, if they take the kinds of steps I have advocated \ntonight--to stand up for the energy consumer in this country--they will \nhave my full support.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant journal clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2681) was agreed to.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is finally \npassing H.R. 3402, as amended--a carefully crafted, bipartisan, \nbicameral compromise to provide for the comprehensive reauthorization \nof both the Violence Against Women Act, VAWA, and the programs and \nauthorities under the jurisdiction of the Department of Justice, DOJ. \nIt has been a long time in coming.\n  I thank Senator Specter, the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, and Senators Biden and Kennedy for their hard work and \nsteadfast support for crafting this compromise legislation. I want to \nespecially recognize Senator Biden for his longstanding commitment to \nfinding ways to help end violence against women and children, and his \nleadership in helping bring the Violence Against Women Act to the floor \nand in ensuring that its vital programs continue.\n  House Judiciary Committee Chairman Sensenbrenner and Ranking Member \nConyers deserve much credit as well for working so closely with us in a \nbipartisan manner to pass legislation in the House of Representatives. \nIt is no easy task to take two large legislative measures and combine \nthem into a single bipartisan, bicameral agreement. That is exactly \nwhat we have done, and we have achieved this milestone because we had \nthe willingness of everyone involved to negotiate in good faith to see \nVAWA and the Justice Department authorization bill ushered into law \nthis year.\n  I would like to highlight several of the provisions of this \nbipartisan measure--a bill that combines the Violence Against Women \nAct, S. 1197, as passed by the Senate, and the Department of Justice \nAppropriations Authorization Act, for Fiscal Years 2006 through 2009, \nH.R. 3402, as passed by the House.\n  The enactment of the Violence Against Women Act more than a decade \nago marked an important national commitment to survivors of domestic \nviolence and sexual assault. I am proud to join Senators Biden, Hatch, \nSpecter and others as an original cosponsor of our reauthorization \neffort. The bill that passed the Senate had 58 cosponsors. Enactment of \nthis measure will further our goal of ending domestic violence, dating \nviolence, sexual assault, and stalking.\n  Earlier in my career as a prosecutor in Vermont, I witnessed the \ndevastating effects of domestic violence. Violence and abuse affect \npeople of all walks of life, regardless of gender, race, culture, age, \nclass or sexuality. Such violence is a crime and it is always wrong, \nwhether the abuser is a family member, someone the victim is dating, a \ncurrent or past spouse, boyfriend, or girlfriend, an acquaintance, or a \nstranger.\n  The National Crime Victimization Survey estimates there were 691,710 \nnon-fatal, violent incidents committed against victims by current and \nformer spouses, boyfriends or girlfriends--also known as intimate \npartners--during 2001. Of those incidents, 85 percent were against \nwomen. The rate of non-fatal intimate partner violence against women \nhas fallen steadily since 1993, when the rate was 9.8 incidents per \n1,000 people. In 2001, the number fell to 5.0 incidents per 1,000 \npeople, nearly a 50 percent reduction, but still unacceptably high. \nTragically, however, the survey found that 1,600 women were killed in \n1976 by a current or former spouse or boyfriend, while in 2000 some\n\n[[Page S13750]]\n\n1,247 women were killed by their intimate partners.\n  According to the annual Vermont Crime Report, the number of forcible \nrapes reported in Vermont rose in 2004 to the highest level in seven \nyears, while the amount of violent crime remained unchanged and overall \ncrime fell by about 5 percent from 2003. Reported incidents of rape \nrose by 58 percent, from 117 in 2003 to 185 in 2004. The average age of \nthe victim was 21, and 47 percent of victims were younger than 18 years \nold. In 74 percent of the cases the perpetrator was an acquaintance of \nthe victim, and in a quarter of the cases the defendant was a family \nmember or intimate partner of the victim. In only 1 percent of the \ncases was the perpetrator a stranger. These figures in my home state \nraise significant concern because violent crime has declined nationwide \nduring that same time period. Numbers like these are why reauthorizing \nVAWA is so vital.\n  Our Nation has made remarkable progress over the past 25 years in \nrecognizing that domestic violence and sexual assault are crimes. We \nhave responded with better laws, social support and coordinated \ncommunity responses. But millions of women, men, children and families \ncontinue to be traumatized by abuse, leading to increased rates of \ncrime, violence and suffering.\n  The Violence Against Women Act has provided aid to law enforcement \nofficers and prosecutors, helped stem domestic violence and child \nabuse, established training programs for victim advocates and \ncounselors, and trained probation and parole officers who work with \nreleased sex offenders. Now Congress has the opportunity to reauthorize \nVAWA and make improvements to vital core programs, tighten criminal \npenalties against domestic abusers, and create new solutions to other \ncrucial aspects of domestic violence and sexual assault. This is an \nopportunity to help treat children victims of violence, augment health \ncare for rape victims, hold repeat offenders and Internet stalkers \naccountable, and help domestic violence victims keep their jobs.\n  Included in this bill are reauthorizations of two programs I \ninitially authored that are vital to helping rural communities battle \ndomestic violence in a setting in which isolation can make it more \ndifficult for both victims and law enforcement. In a small, rural state \nlike Vermont, our county and local law enforcement agencies rely \nheavily on cooperative, interagency efforts to combat and solve \nsignificant problems. That is why I sought to include the Rural \nDomestic Violence and Child Victimization Enforcement Grant Program as \npart of the original VAWA. This program helps make services available \nto rural victims and children by encouraging community involvement in \ndeveloping a coordinated response to combat domestic violence, dating \nviolence and child abuse. Adequate resources combined with sustained \ncommitment will bring about significant improvements in rural areas to \nthe lives of those victimized by domestic and sexual violence.\n  The Rural Grants Program section of VAWA 2005 reauthorizes and \nexpands the existing education, training and services grant programs \nthat address violence against women in rural areas. This provision \nrenews the rural VAWA program, extends direct grants to state and local \ngovernments for services in rural areas and expands areas to include \ncommunity collaboration projects in rural areas and the creation or \nexpansion of additional victim services. This provision includes new \nlanguage that expands the program coverage to sexual assault, child \nsexual assault and stalking. It also expands eligibility from rural \nstates to rural communities, increasing access to rural sections of \notherwise highly populated states. This section authorizes $55,000,000 \nannually for 2006 through 2010, an increase of $15 million per year.\n  The second grant program initiative on which I have focused is the \nTransitional Housing Assistance Grants for Victims of Domestic \nViolence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault or Stalking. This program, \nwhich became law as part of the PROTECT Act of 2003, authorizes grants \nfor transitional housing and related services for people fleeing \ndomestic violence, sexual assault or stalkers. At a time when the \navailability of affordable housing has sunk to record lows, \ntransitional housing for victims is especially needed. Today more than \n50 percent of homeless individuals are women and children fleeing \ndomestic violence. We have a clear problem that is in dire need of a \nsolution. This program is part of the solution.\n  Transitional housing allows women to bridge the gap between leaving \nviolence in their homes and becoming self-sufficient. VAWA 2005 amends \nthe existing transitional housing program by expanding the current \ndirect-assistance grants to include funds for operational, capital and \nrenovation costs. Other changes include providing services to victims \nof dating violence, sexual assault and stalking; extending the length \nof time for receipt of benefits to match that used by Housing and Urban \nDevelopment transitional housing programs; and updating the existing \nprogram to reflect the concerns of the service provision community. The \nprovision would increase the authorized funding for this grant program \nfrom $30,000,000, to $40,000,000.\n  The reauthorization of VAWA is an important part of our efforts to \nincrease awareness of the problem of violence, to save the lives of \nbattered women, rape victims and children who grow up with violence and \nto continue progress against the devastating tragedy of domestic \nviolence. I look forward to seeing it signed into law and thus \nstrengthen the prevention of violence against women and children and \nits devastating costs and consequences.\n  In the 107th Congress, we properly authorized appropriations for the \nentire Department of Justice for the first time since 1979. We had \nextended that authorization in 1980 and 1981, but until 2002 neither \nhad Congress passed nor the President signed an authorization bill for \nthe Department. In fact, there were a number of years in which Congress \nfailed to consider any Department authorization bill. This 26-year \nfailure to properly reauthorize the Department forced the \nAppropriations committees in both chambers to reauthorize and \nappropriate money.\n  We ceded the authorization power to the appropriators for too long, \nbut in the 107th Congress Senator Hatch and I joined forces with House \nJudiciary Chairman Sensenbrenner and Ranking Member Conyers to create \nand pass bipartisan legislation that reaffirmed the authorizing \nauthority and responsibility of the House and Senate Judiciary \nCommittees--the ``21st Century Department of Justice Appropriations \nAuthorization Act,'' Public Law 107-273. A new era of oversight began \nwith that new charter for the Justice Department, with the Senate and \nHouse Judiciary Committees taking more-active new roles in setting the \npriorities and monitoring the operations of the Department of Justice, \nthe FBI and other law enforcement agencies, and that bill helped our \noversight duties in many ways. And, as we have learned in recent years, \nthe fight against terrorism makes constructive oversight more important \nthan ever before.\n  Earlier this year, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Sensenbrenner \nand Ranking Member Conyers authored and shepherded through the House of \nRepresentatives a new Department of Justice Appropriations \nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Years 2006 through 2009, H.R. 3402. I \ncommend both Chairman Sensenbrenner and Ranking Member Conyers for \nworking in a bipartisan manner to pass that legislation in the House of \nRepresentatives. It is on that comprehensive authorization of the \nJustice Department that the bipartisan, bicameral compromise the Senate \nnow considers was built.\n  The bill we are considering today not only authorizes appropriations \nfor the Justice Department for fiscal years 2006 through 2009, but also \nprovides permanent enabling authorities to allow the Department to \nefficiently carry out its mission, clarifies and harmonizes existing \nstatutory authority, and repeals obsolete statutory authorities. It \nestablishes certain reporting requirements and other mechanisms \nintended to better enable the Congress to oversee DOJ operations.\n  In addition to the important oversight tools provided in the bill, \nthere are many additional sound provisions designed to improve the \nadministration of programs within the Justice Department. For example, \nin Section 1111 we eliminate duplication by consolidating\n\n[[Page S13751]]\n\nthe Local Law Enforcement Block Grant, LLEBG, program and the Byrne \nFormula Grant Program into one program--the Edward Byrne Memorial \nJustice Assistance Grant Program--with the same purposes and simplified \nadministration. We authorize funding for this program at $1.095 billion \nin FY 2006, which is $678.5 million--or 62 percent--more than the \nactual amount appropriated, and such sums as may be necessary for each \nof fiscal years 2007 through 2009.\n  I am a longtime supporter of the Edward Byrne Memorial State and \nLocal Law Enforcement Assistance Program and the LLEBG Program, both of \nwhich have been continuously targeted for elimination by this \nAdministration. As a senator from a rural State that relies on these \ngrants to combat crime, I have been concerned with the President's \nproposals for funding and program eliminations of these well-\nestablished grant programs. Our legislation makes clear that the same \nauthorized funding levels and uses will be available under the new, \nconsolidated grant program as under the previous ones.\n  When we began negotiations with the House on the Justice Department \nauthorization portion of this package, I expressed to Congressman \nSensenbrenner my concerns that a combination of the merger of and \ndrastic funding cuts to these programs will cause smaller states to \nlose the assistance on which they rely to prevent and control crime and \nimprove the criminal justice system. In rural states, the State \nAdministering Agency and state agencies are the local criminal justice \nresources; they are more than just state level actors. Additionally, \nmore often than not our rural States are ground zero for the rapidly \nincreasing methamphetamine manufacturing and distribution. It is on \nByrne funding that rural States and small towns rely to stem the \nscourge of methamphetamine.\n\n  Byrne funding is the backbone of counterdrug enforcement and \nprosecution efforts in Vermont. Over the years, Vermont has been able \nto support a broad spectrum of projects within corrections, courts, \ntraining, forensics, and domestic violence and victim services. Chances \nare none of these initiatives will be possible under the new Byrne \nprogram formula because of the drop in funding level and funding \ndistribution method. Since FY 2004, after which the new formula was \napplied, Byrne funds to Vermont have dropped by more than $1.2 million, \nor 61 percent. Clearly, the Byrne program affords States and \ncommunities the ability to use funding for a variety of crime-fighting \nactivities, but unfortunately not the means.\n  I appreciate the willingness of Congressman Sensenbrenner to work \nwith me during our negotiations to find a solution to ease the loss of \nByrne grants by small rural States during these tough fiscal times. The \nagreement we came to provides for reserved funds that allow the \nAttorney General to set aside up to 5 percent of the total amount made \navailable for Byrne formula grants for States or local governments to \ncombat, address or otherwise respond to precipitous or extraordinary \nincreases in crime; or to prevent, compensate for or mitigate \nsignificant programmatic harm resulting from operation of the new Byrne \nformula.\n  We increase the authorization for grants to drug courts to $70 \nmillion for each of fiscal years 2007 and 2008. In addition, we provide \nfor targeted technical assistance and training by the newly created \nCommunity Capacity Development Office to assist applicants in how to \nsuccessfully pursue grants under the program, and to strengthen \nexisting State drug court systems. Under that technical assistance and \ntraining, the Community Capacity Development Office will consider and \nrespond to the unique needs of rural States, rural areas and rural \ncommunities that wish to implement and enhance drug court systems.\n  I am pleased that this compromise package provides an extension \nthrough 2009 for the Campbell-Leahy Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant \nProgram, an existing matching grant program authorized at $50 million \nto help State, tribal, and local jurisdictions purchase armor vests for \nuse by law enforcement officers.\n  Our former colleague, Senator Campbell, and I authored the \nBulletproof Vest Grant Partnership Act of 1998 in response to the \ntragic Carl Drega shootout in 1997 on the Vermont-New Hampshire border, \nin which two State troopers who did not have bulletproof vests were \nkilled. The Federal officers who responded to the scenes of the \nshooting spree were equipped with life-saving body armor, but the State \nand local law enforcement officers lacked protective vests because of \nthe cost. Two years later, we successfully passed the Bulletproof Vest \nPartnership Grant Act of 2000, and in the closing days of the last \nCongress we again successfully extended the program's authorization \nthrough 2007 by including it in the State Justice Institute \nReauthorization Act, Public Law 108-372.\n  Year after year, the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Program saves the \nlives of law enforcement officers nationwide by providing more help to \nState and local law enforcement agencies to purchase body armor. Since \nits inception in 1999, this highly successful DOJ program has provided \nlaw enforcement officers in 16,000 jurisdictions nationwide with nearly \n350,000 new bulletproof vests. In Vermont, more than 150 municipalities \nhave been fortunate to receive funding for the purchase of 1,400 vests. \nWithout the Federal funding given by this program, I daresay there \nwould be close to that number of police officers without vests in \nVermont today.\n  We know that body armor saves lives, but the cost has put these vests \nout of the reach of many of the officers who need them. This program \nmakes it more affordable for police departments of all sizes. Few \nthings mean more to me than when I meet Vermont police officers and \nthey tell me that the protective vests they wear were made possible \nbecause of this program. This is the least we should do for the \nofficers on the front lines who put themselves in danger for us every \nday. I want to make sure that every police officer who needs a \nbulletproof vest gets one.\n  I am also pleased that we include a $4 million authorization for \nSEARCH's National Technical Assistance and Training Program. SEARCH is \nthe only no-cost service for small- and medium-sized criminal justice \nagencies nationwide to assist them in enhancing and upgrading their \ninformation systems, building integrated information systems that all \ncriminal justice agencies need, and ensuring compatibility between \nlocal systems and State, regional and national systems.\n  I thank my colleagues again for supporting the final passage of this \ncompromise package so that all of this bipartisan and bicameral work, \nas well as all the good that this legislation will do, will reach the \nPresident's desk and become law. And again I particularly want to thank \nSenate Judiciary Chairman Specter and Senators Biden and Kennedy, who \nworked so hard to help construct a good, fair and balanced compromise. \nLikewise, I want to thank Chairman Sensenbrenner and Representative \nConyers of the House Judiciary Committee for working with us to \nconclude these negotiations so successfully.\n  The staffs of these Members must also be recognized for their \ntireless work around the clock to bring so many pieces together into a \nwinning package. In particular, the House Judiciary Committee staff has \nbeen enormously helpful, including Phil Kiko, Katy Crooks, Brian \nBenczkowski, George Fishman, Cindy Blackston, Perry Apelbaum, Sampak \nGarg, Stacey Dansky and Kristin Wells. The Senate Judiciary Committee \nstaff has shown outstanding commitment to this legislation. I want to \nthank Mike O'Neill, Brett Tolman, Lisa Owings, Joe Jacquot, Juria Jones \nand Hannibal Kemerer with Chairman Specter; Louisa Terrell, Eric Rosen \nand Marcia Lee with Senator Biden; and Janice Kaguyutan and Christine \nLeonard with Senator Kennedy. Last, but by no means least, I want to \ncommend members of my own staff--Bruce Cohen, Ed Pagano, Tara Magner, \nMatt Nelson and Jessica Berry--for their unfailing support for these \nprovisions, and for their hard work in bringing this compromise package \nto the floor.\n  I look forward to both Senate and House passage of this bipartisan, \nbicameral package to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act and the \nDepartment of Justice. Mr. President, this is an important piece of \nlegislation that will make a difference in the lives of millions of \nAmericans, and it deserves our full support.\n\n[[Page S13752]]\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I applaud the sponsors of this bill to \nreauthorize the Violence Against Women Act for their tireless \nleadership in the campaign to end the abuse of women. In particular, I \nthank them for their foresight in incorporating the International \nMarriage Broker Regulation Act of 2005 ``IMBRA'' as one of its \nsubtitles. This important piece of legislation, which I introduce with \nSenator Maria Cantwell in the Senate, is intended to address Congress' \nconcerns about a significant and growing problem: the high incidence of \nviolent abuse of foreign women brought to this country as fiancees or \nspouses by American men whom they meet through for-profit international \nmarriage brokers ``IMBs,'' commonly known as ``mail-order bride'' \nagencies.\n  After learning from the Tahirih Justice Center and other front-line \nexperts about the terrible circumstances in which many of these women \nfind themselves, I convened a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee in July 2004 to call attention to the abuse and exploitation \nof women and their children through this industry. Since it comes as a \ngreat surprise to many people that such agencies actually exist in the \nmodem day, that are legal in this country, and that they are on the \nrise, not the decline, I want to share some further background that \nwill explain why it is so important that Congress has acted today to \ncompel the industry and its clients to clean up their act.\n  First, this is an increasing problem. The IMB industry has exploded \nin recent years, greatly facilitated by the Internet. According to \nstatistics from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, an \nestimated one-third to one-half of all foreign fiancees admitted to the \nU.S. each year--9,500 to 14,500 women in 2004 alone--and many thousand \nmore admitted foreign wives, have met their American husbands through \nIMBs. The number of foreign fiancees admitted to the U.S. more than \ndoubled between 1998 and 2002, and continues to climb.\n  Second, the industry bears significant responsibility for women's \nvulnerability to abuse, and has done little if anything on its own \ninitiative to safeguard them. Over a half-decade ago, the then-\nImmigration and Naturalization Service concluded in a report to \nCongress that, ``with the burgeoning number of unregulated \ninternational matchmaking organizations and clients using their \nservices, the potential for abuse in mail-order marriages is \nconsiderable.'' The INS study further noted that American men who use \nIMBs tend to seek relationships with women whom they feel they can \ncontrol. Moreover, the marketing and business practices of IMBs also \nheighten the risk of abuse by feeding this perception. Agencies often \nadvertise the women they recruit as being submissive to male clients, \nwho might pay up to several thousand dollars to gain access to those \nwomen. Other industry practices, from ``satisfaction guarantees'' or \n``shopping cart'' features on agency web sites to so-called ``romance \ntours'' overseas that virtually line up several hundred women recruits \nfor inspection by a dozen male clients during a single ``mixer,'' make \nperfectly clear that the woman is the commodity provided for the male \nclient's consumption. An inevitable and dangerous sense of ownership by \nthe men in their costly investments can develop. Several highly \npublicized murders of women by husbands whom they met through IMBs \nhighlight a growing nationwide trend of abuse. A 2003 survey conducted \nby the Tahirih Justice Center found that over 50 percent of programs \nproviding legal services to battered immigrant women nationwide had \nserved women battered by men whom they had met through IMBs.\n\n  Third, women who are recruited by IMBs are at a tremendous \ninformational disadvantage that a brutal predator can exploit. These \nforeign fiancees and spouses often are unable to obtain reliable \ninformation about the criminal and marital histories of their American \nfiancees and spouses, and are unaware of the legal rights and resources \navailable to victims of domestic violence in the U.S. An all-too-common \nresult is that women from across the globe are exploited across this \ncountry, as a brief memorandum from the Tahirih Justice Center \nexplains, and which I will have printed in the Congressional Record.\n  The information requirements established by this subtitle are \ndesigned to require disclosure of the kinds of criminal convictions in \nthe background of a petitioning American fiance or spouse that indicate \nhe could be prone to domestic violence. This will enable a foreign \nwoman to make an informed decision about coming to this country for \nmarriage to an American man, in advance, with her safety and that of \nher children in mind. The provisions of this subtitle would also \nprovide her with information about where she can turn for help, \nincluding vital safety nets and social services available to domestic \nviolence and sexual assault victims, if she experiences abuse at the \nhands of her American fiance or spouse.\n  A simple but incredibly powerful premise drives these provisions: \nthat this information can help a woman help herself, help her save \nherself or her child from becoming the next victim of a predatory \nabuser. Through this information and other safeguards, this important \nlegislation will help prevent those intent on doing women harm from \nperverting and subverting both the institution of marriage and the \nimmigration process to find new victims overseas.\n  So again, I thank my colleagues for their inclusion of these vital \nprotections, and thank them, too, on behalf of the women and children \nwhom they have spared today from tragedies tomorrow.\n  I ask unaminous consent the memorandum be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Illustrative Cases of Women and Their Children Exploited and Abused \n           Through the International Marriage Broker Industry\n\n       Alabama: Thomas Robert Lane was charged with the murder of \n     his estranged Filipina wife, Teresa Lane. Teresa's body was \n     discovered in a bathtub filled with running water. \n     Authorities found evidence that Lane drowned his wife by \n     pinning her under the water with his foot. A forensic \n     physician determined that Teresa was also subjected to blunt \n     force trauma. During the couple's separation, Lane had been \n     trying to arrange to marry yet another woman from the \n     Philippines.\n       California: Marilyn Carroll married Steffan Carroll in the \n     Philippines in 1988. One year later, he traveled to Thailand \n     to marry another young woman, Preeya. Before marrying his \n     second wife, Carroll assured her that it was legal in \n     California to have two wives. The bigamous marriage ended \n     when Marilyn called the police to report that Carroll had \n     sexually assaulted her--restraining her with thumbcuffs and \n     other devices during the attack. Carroll was charged with \n     bigamy and false imprisonment.\n       Georgia: Shortly after Katerina Sheridan, a young woman \n     from Siberia, married Frank Sheridan, he kept her a virtual \n     prisoner, forbidding her to keep her own set of house keys, \n     and taking away her visa, passport, and birth certificate. \n     Later, he also took away her cell phone and cut all the phone \n     lines in the house. He flew into violent rages, on one \n     occasion beating Katerina and dragging her around the house \n     by her legs. After several such incidents, Katerina told him \n     that she wanted to go back to Russia. In retaliation, \n     Sheridan stabbed himself and then accused her of doing it to \n     get her thrown in jail. Later, Katerina managed to make it to \n     a women's shelter, but Sheridan stalked her relentlessly and \n     tried to get her detained and deported. When police went to \n     arrest Frank for aggravated stalking, they discovered he was \n     in Russia looking for a new bride. Months later, when an \n     officer went to arrest Sheridan for another stalking-related \n     crime, he shot the officer. The deputy returned fire and \n     killed Sheridan.\n       Hawaii: The mutilated body of a young Filipina woman, Helen \n     Mendoza Krug, was found in a garbage dumpster behind her \n     high-rise apartment building. The murder was committed in \n     front of her 2-year-old son by her husband, Robert Krug, whom \n     she had met through an IMB. Krug was sentenced to life in \n     prison.\n       Kentucky: ``Dina'' corresponded with her husband ``Paul,'' \n     an anesthesiologist, for several months before she agreed to \n     marry him when he visited her and her family in Ethiopia. \n     When she came to the United States, however, Paul took Dina's \n     money and passport, brought her to a motel (the first of \n     five), and kept her drugged and imprisoned for weeks while he \n     subjected her to horrific physical, sexual, and mental abuse. \n     Paul also threatened Dina that she, not Paul, would be \n     arrested and jailed if she reported him to the police. Only \n     when Paul left to attend a conference for a few days did she \n     regain enough consciousness and strength to drag herself to \n     the motel office for help. Paul killed himself before he \n     could be prosecuted. Dina received protection under US \n     trafficking laws.\n       Minnesota: Soon after ``Medina,'' a Ukrainian college \n     professor, married ``Thomas,'' a well-respected doctor, \n     Thomas turned controlling and violent. Among other outbursts,\n\n[[Page S13753]]\n\n     he threatened Medina with a knife; kicked her in the chest; \n     and even attempted to push her out of a moving car. Thomas \n     also slept with an ax in his drawer and threatened to have \n     her deported if she ever called the police. Medina left \n     Thomas after he broke her son's finger. Today, Medina \n     continues to live in constant fear of Thomas, who stalks \n     and harasses her. Despite knowing about Medina's abuse, \n     the IMB facilitated a new match between Thomas and another \n     Ukrainian woman who also later fled because of abuse. \n     Medina was Thomas' third wife; he had also abused at least \n     one of his prior wives.\n       New Jersey: A 26-year-old Ukrainian engineer named Alla \n     bled to death on the floor of her car after her husband \n     Lester Barney, 58, slashed her throat in front of the \n     couple's 4-year-old son, Daniel. Barney fled with Daniel from \n     the scene, the parking lot of the boy's daycare center, but \n     after an Amber Alert was triggered he turned Daniel over to a \n     friend and was himself taken into custody by police. Alla had \n     been granted a restraining order against Barney a few months \n     before and had been given temporary custody of Daniel.\n       New York: Andrew Gole, a former policeman from Long Island, \n     was convicted of murdering Martha Isabel Moncada on a trip \n     back to her home country, Honduras, after she told him she \n     did not want to return with him to the United States. Martha \n     had tried to leave the abusive Gole before, but had feared \n     losing custody of their newborn son to him. Gole strangled \n     and dismembered Martha in their hotel room in front of their \n     baby and Martha's disabled son from her first marriage, then \n     dumped her remains along the roadside. Police arrested Gole \n     as he tried to flee the country after abandoning the older \n     boy at a gas station.\n       Pennsylvania: Though she was trained as an accountant, \n     Norman McDonald compelled his Ukrainian wife to take several \n     waitress jobs and rely on him for transportation so he would \n     have long stretches of time alone with her daughter, who was \n     only 3 when the couple married. With his wife securely out of \n     the house, McDonald showed the toddler pornographic videos of \n     what he wanted to do to her and then raped her. Two years \n     after the abuse started, his wife discovered what McDonald \n     was doing and immediately contacted the police. Authorities \n     found more than 10,000 images of child pornography in \n     McDonald's computer and hundreds of video clips that depicted \n     him having sex with his stepdaughter. McDonald's 28-year-old \n     daughter from a previous marriage testified that her father \n     had also abused her as a child.\n       Texas: Jack Reeves, a retired U.S. Army officer, was \n     convicted of killing his fourth wife, Emelita Reeves, a 26-\n     year-old from the Philippines whom he met through an IMB \n     called ``Cherry Blossoms.'' Emelita had confided to family \n     and friends that Reeves physically and sexually abused her, \n     and told friends she planned to leave him a day before she \n     disappeared. Two of Reeves' previous wives also died under \n     suspicious circumstances (drowning and suicide). During the \n     investigation into Emelita's death, the State re-opened the \n     investigation into Reeves' second wife's death, and obtained \n     a further conviction against him. The State did not have \n     enough evidence to re-open the investigation into the third \n     wife's murder because Reeves had cremated her body. Reeves \n     was also suspected in the mysterious disappearance of a \n     Russian woman with whom he had lived with in 1991.\n       Virginia/Maryland: A young Ukrainian medical student named \n     ``Nina'' married ``John,'' a U.S. military officer residing \n     in Virginia whom she met through a Maryland-based IMB with a \n     ``satisfaction guaranteed'' policy. Throughout their one-year \n     marriage, John repeatedly physically and emotionally abused \n     Nina, shaking her violently and insisting that she repeat the \n     commands he gave her. He choked, raped, and beat her on \n     several occasions, ripped a tooth out of her mouth, and \n     threatened her with a knife. When Nina informed the president \n     of the IMB about the abuse, the president said that Nina's \n     experience was normal and that many girls had the same \n     problem. The president said domestic violence is ``just the \n     American culture,'' and abuse is ``very hard to prove.''\n       Washington: Susanna Blackwell met her husband through an \n     IMB called ``Asian Encounters'' and left the Philippines to \n     settle with him in Washington state in 1994. Blackwell \n     physically abused Susanna, including one incident in which he \n     choked her the day after their wedding. Susanna reported the \n     abuse to the police and obtained a protection order against \n     him. While awaiting divorce/annulment proceedings in a \n     Seattle courtroom many months later, the pregnant Susanna and \n     two of her friends were shot to death. Blackwell was \n     convicted of murdering all three women.\n       Anastasia King, a young woman from Kyrgyzstan, was found \n     strangled to death and buried in a shallow grave in \n     Washington state in December 2000. At the age of 18, \n     Anastasia was selected by her husband, Indle King, out of an \n     IMB's catalogue of prospective brides. Two years later, \n     wanting another bride and allegedly unwilling to pay for a \n     divorce, King ordered a tenant in their Washington home to \n     kill Anastasia. Weighing nearly 300 pounds, King pinned \n     Anastasia down while the tenant strangled her with a necktie. \n     Both were convicted of murder. King's previous wife, whom he \n     had also met through an IMB, had a domestic violence \n     protection order issued against him and left him because he \n     was abusive.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support the Violence Against \nWomen Act of 2005, and I commend Senator Biden, Senator Specter, \nSenator Leahy and Senator Hatch for their bipartisan leadership on this \nvery important legislation. The current authorization for the act \nexpired on September 30, and it has taken far too long to build upon \nthe successes of existing anti-violence against women programs and \nenhance the safety and security of the victims of domestic violence, \ndating violence, sexual assault, and stalking.\n  We have a responsibility in Congress to do all we can to eradicate \ndomestic violence. Our bill gives the safety of women and their \nfamilies the high priority it deserves, and I urge my colleagues in the \nHouse to support it.\n  This bill eases housing problems for battered women. It also includes \nnew funds for training health professionals to recognize and respond to \ndomestic and sexual violence, and to help public health officials \nrecognize the need as well. The research funds provided by the bill are \nvital, because we need the best possible interventions in health care \nsettings to prevent future violence.\n  Violence against women can occur at any point in a woman's life, \nbeginning in childhood and taking place in a wide variety of \ncircumstances and settings. It's essential for any bill on such \nviolence to include girls and young women as well, and this bill does \nthat.\n  Another important section of the bill provides greater help to \nimmigrant victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, trafficking and \nsimilar offenses. This section will remove the obstacles in our current \nimmigration laws that prevent such victims from safely fleeing the \nviolence in their lives, and help dispel the fear that often prevents \nthem from reporting their abusers to appropriate authorities.\n  Eliminating domestic violence is especially challenging in immigrant \ncommunities, since victims often face additional cultural, linguistic \nand immigration barriers to their safety. Abusers of immigrant spouses \nor children are liable to use threats of deportation to trap them in \nendless years of violence. Many of us have heard horrific stories of \nviolence in cases where the threat of deportation was used against \nspouses or children--``If you leave me, I'll report you to the \nimmigration authorities, and you'll never see the children again.'' Or \nthe abuser says, ``If you tell the police what I did, I'll have \nimmigration deport you.''\n  Congress has made significant progress in enacting protections for \nthese immigrant victims, but there are still many women and children \nwhose lives are in danger. Our legislation does much more to protect \nthem, and I commend the sponsors for making domestic violence in \nimmigrant communities an important priority.\n  The improvements in immigration protections in the bill are designed \nto help prevent the deportation of immigrant victims who qualify for \nimmigration relief under the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA). It will \nconsolidate adjudications of such immigration cases in a specially \ntrained unit, enhance confidentiality protections for victims, and \noffer protection to vulnerable immigrant victims who had been left out \nof the protections in current law.\n  Overall, the bill represents major new progress in protecting women \nfrom violence, and I look forward to early action by the House in this \nimportant reauthorization.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a more detailed summary of the \nprovisions on immigrants be printed at this point in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows.\n\n\n                              Section 104\n\n  This section provides important improvements to legal services for \nimmigrant victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, trafficking and \nother crimes. This provision authorizes organizations receiving funds \nfrom the Legal Services Corporation to use the funds including Legal \nServices funds to represent any victim of domestic violence, sexual \nassault, trafficking or other crimes listed under the U visa provisions \nof the Immigration and Nationality Act. Across the country, many \nimmigrant victims have nowhere to turn for legal help. This section \nwill\n\n[[Page S13754]]\n\nallow Legal Services Corporation-funded programs to represent victims \nin any type of case, including family law, public benefits, health, \nhousing, immigration, restraining orders, and other legal matters, \nregardless of the victim's immigration status.\n\n\n                              Section 805\n\n  This section assures that self-petitioners under the Act and their \nchildren are guaranteed all of the Act's aging out protections and any \nbenefits they qualify for under the Child Status Protection Act of \n2002, which deals with the lengthy processing backlogs which made \n``aging out'' a significant problem for child beneficiaries who turned \n21 years old.\n\n\n                              Section 813\n\n  This section deals with cases of immigrant victims of abuse who have \nbeen ordered removed, or who are subject to expedited removal if they \nleave the U.S. and attempt to reenter the country later. Once they are \nreinstated in removal proceedings, they cannot obtain relief under \ncurrent law, even if they have a pending application for such relief. \nThis section makes clear that the Secretary of Homeland Security, the \nAttorney General, and the Secretary of State have discretion to consent \nto a victim's reapplication for admission after a previous order of \nremoval, deportation, or exclusion.\n\n\n                              Section 814\n\n  This section gives the Department of Homeland Security statutory \nauthority to grant work authorization to approved self-petitioners \nunder the Act. This provision will streamline a petitioner's ability to \nreceive work authorization, without having to rely solely upon deferred \naction as the mechanism through which petitioners receive work \nauthorization.\n  The section also grants work authorization to abused spouses of \npersons admitted under the A, E-3, G, or H non-immigrant visa programs. \nThese spouses have legal permission to live in the United States under \ntheir spouses' visas, but they are not entitled to work authorization \nunder current law. The spouses and their children are completely \ndependent on the abuser for their immigration status and financial \nsupport, and they often have nowhere to turn for help. Financial \ndependence on their abusers is a primary reason why battered women are \noften reluctant to cooperate in domestic violence criminal cases. With \nemployment authorization, many abused spouses protected by this section \nwill be able to work legally, and can have a source of income \nindependent of their abusers.\n  Requests for work authorization by these abused spouses will be \nhandled under the procedures for petitioners under the Act and the \nspecially trained VAWA unit at the Vermont Service Center will \nadjudicate these requests.\n  The VAWA unit employs specially-trained adjudicators who handle \npetitions filed by at-risk applicants for relief under the Act, for T \nvisas, for U visas, for adjustment of status and employment \nauthorizations, as well as protections under the Haitian Refugee \nImmigrant Fairness Act and Sections 202 and 203 of the Nicaraguan \nAdjustment and Central American Relief Act. The unit also deals with \nwaivers for battered spouses, parole for their children granted VAWA \ncancellation, and parole for approved petitioners under the Act.\n\n\n                              Section 818\n\n  This section extends confidentiality protections to the Department of \nHomeland Security, the Department of Justice, and the Department of \nState. Under these provisions, immigration enforcement agents and \ngovernment officials may not use information furnished by an abuser, \ncrime perpetrator or trafficker to make an adverse determination on the \nadmissibility or deportability of an individual. One of the goals of \nthis section is to ensure that these government officials do not \ninitiate contact with abusers, call abusers as witnesses, or rely on \ninformation from abusers to apprehend, detain and attempt to remove \nvictims of domestic violence, sexual assault, trafficking, or other \ncrimes.\n  This section gives the specially trained VAWA unit the discretion to \nrefer victims to non-profit non-governmental organizations to obtain a \nrange of needed assistance and services. Referrals should be made to \nprograms with expertise in providing assistance to immigrant victims of \nviolence and can be made only after obtaining written consent from the \nimmigrant victim.\n  The section also requires the Department of Homeland Security and the \nDepartment of Justice to provide guidance to officers and employees who \nhave access to confidential information under this section in order to \nprotect victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, trafficking and \nother crimes from harm that could result from inappropriate disclosure \nof confidential information.\n\n\n                              Section 827\n\n  This section deals with issues under the Real ID Act of 2005 which \nimposes a new national requirement that all applicants for driver's \nlicenses or state identification cards must furnish their physical \nresidential address in order to obtain a federally valid license or \nidentification card. The current requirement jeopardizes victims of \nviolence who may be living in confidential shelters for battered women, \nor fleeing their abuser. The section instructs the Department of \nHomeland Security and the Social Security Administration to give \nspecial consideration to these victims by allowing them to use an \nalternate safe address in lieu of their residence. Our goal here is to \nguarantee the continuing protection and necessary mobility for these \nwomen and their families.\n\n\n                              Section 831\n\n  This section is intended to deter abusive U.S. citizens from using \nthe fiance visa process and to help foreign fiances obtain information \nabout their prospective U.S. citizen spouse that can help them protect \nthemselves against domestic violence. Citizens filing K visa fiance \npetitions will be required to disclose certain criminal convictions on \nthe K visa application for a fiance or spouse.\n  In addition, this section requires the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity, in consultation with the Attorney General and the Secretary \nof State to develop an information pamphlet for K visa applicants on \nthe legal rights and available resources for immigrant victims of \ndomestic violence.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, the Violence Against Women Act, VAWA, \napproved by the Senate today contains an important provision that is \nintended to protect women who have already been victimized once by \nsexual assault from being assaulted again by either the deadly AIDS \nvirus or the legal system which may deny them potentially life-saving \ninformation.\n  Section 102 of VAWA now encourages States to implement laws that \nprovide victims of sexual assault and rape the opportunity to know if \nthe person indicted for the assault is infected with HIV. This new \nprovision will require the Attorney General to reduce the amount of \nfunding provided under Section 102 by 5 percent to a State or local \ngovernment that has not demonstrated that laws are in place to allow a \nvictim to request that a defendant, against whom an information or \nindictment is presented for a crime in which by force or threat of \nforce the perpetrator compels the victim to engage in sexual activity, \nbe tested for HIV disease if the nature of the alleged crime is such \nthat the sexual activity would have placed the victim at risk of \nbecoming infected with HIV. The defendant must undergo the test not \nlater than 48 hours after the date on which the information or \nindictment is presented, and as soon thereafter as is practicable the \nresults of the test must be made available to the victim. As medically \nappropriate, the victim may request follow-up testing of the defendant. \nIf a State or local government does not currently allow victims of \nsexual assault such protections, assurances must be made to the \nAttorney General that the state legislature will bring their laws into \ncompliance before the end of their next session or within 2 years. The \n5 percent penalty will not go into effect until the expiration of the \ntwo year extension\n  The bill will also now allow Federal VAWA funds to be used to pay for \nHIV testing of sexual assault perpetrators and notification and \ncounseling programs.\n  These provisions are desperately needed to address a real, grievous \ninjustice that victims of sexual assault are facing in many states.\n  In the summer of 1996, a 7-year-old girl was brutally raped by a 57-\nyear-old aged man who later told police he was infected with HIV. The \nlittle girl and\n\n[[Page S13755]]\n\nher 5-year-old brother had been lured to a secluded, abandoned building \nin the East New York section of Brooklyn. The man raped and sodomized \nthe girl. Her brother, meanwhile, was beaten, tied up, and forced to \nwitness his sister's rape. After the man's arrest, the defendant \nrefused to be tested for the AIDS virus by the Brooklyn District \nAttorney's office. His refusal to take the test was permitted under \nState law.\n\n  In the spring of 2002, Ramell Rodgers repeatedly raped ``Jane,'' a \nfemale New York cab driver at gunpoint. The New York Daily News \nreported at the time that ``Rodgers is in jail awaiting trial, while \n`Jane' spends her days vomiting from drugs she takes to stave off \nsexually transmitted diseases she may have contracted in the attack. \nOfficials say DNA evidence links Rodgers to the March 31 assault. \nAccording to sources close to the case, he has even admitted guilt. But \nhe is not required to be tested for diseases until he is formally \nconvicted.''\n  ``Jane'' is determined to change the law to protect others who have \nbeen victimized by rape and sexual assault. Disguised in a scarf, wig \nsunglasses, she spoke at a New York State Federation of Taxi Drivers \npress conference:\n\n       As a precaution, I have to take ``four different medicines \n     [to help protect against HIV, chlamydia, herpes and other \n     STDs], and I was told that, unless this guy volunteers for \n     the test, I had to wait until he was convicted.'' She added: \n     ``If you are assaulted, you should have the right to know \n     whether or not this person has infected you with anything.\n\n  One November evening in 2002, Doris Stewart, who was then 64, was \nawakened from her sleep when she heard a knock at her front door. When \nshe went to the door, a man forced his way inside, then raped, \nsodomized and robbed her. Stewart's assault was just the beginning of \nher emotional distress. She harbors fears that her assailant may have \nHIV, but she has no way of knowing with certainty because Alabama is \nanother of the few States that do not require testing of rape suspects \nfor HIV. Stewart, who was advised by rape counselors to wait about 2 \nmonths before being tested, lived with fear of the unknown for months \nbecause it can take at least 3 to 6 months for HIV to be detected after \ninfection. ``Everybody I talk to thinks it's so unfair that there's no \nlaw in Alabama,'' said Stewart who has attempted to change the state \nlaw to protect future rape victims.\n  There are countless stories of other women and children who have been \nvictims of rape and sexual assault who have been denied access to this \npotentially life saving information. In some circumstances, rape \ndefendants have even used HIV status information as a plea bargaining \ntool to reduce their sentences.\n  As a practicing physician, I believe that its is vitally important \nthat those who have been raped do not also become victims of HIV/AIDS, \nand that requires timely medical attention including prompt testing of \nthe defendant. Treatment with AIDS drugs in the immediate aftermath, \nusually within 72 hours, of exposure can significantly reduce the \nchance of infection. However, because of the toxicity and long-term \nside effects, these drugs should not be administered for long periods \nwithout knowing if HIV exposure has occurred.\n  Victims can not rely solely on testing themselves because it can take \nweeks, sometimes months, before HIV antibodies can be detected. \nTherefore, testing the assailant is the only timely manner in which to \ndetermine if someone has been exposed to HIV. Furthermore, rapid tests \nare now available that can diagnose HIV infection within 20 minutes \nwith more than 99 percent accuracy.\n\n  The American Medical Association supports this policy because ``early \nknowledge that a defendant is HIV infected would allow the victim to \ngain access to the ever growing arsenal of new HIV treatment options. \nIn addition, knowing that the defendant was HIV infected would help the \nvictim avoid contact which might put others at risk of infection.''\n  While the HIV infection rate among sexual assault victims has not \nbeen studied, the National Rape Crisis Center estimates the rate is \nhigher than the general population because the violent nature of the \nforced sexual contact increases the chances of transmission.\n  I was very disappointed that the National Center for Victims of \nCrime, NCVC and the American Civil Liberties Union, ACLU, opposed this \nprovision. NCVC claimed that ``mandatory testing of sex offenders may \nnot be in the best interest of the victim/survivor.'' The ACLU claimed \nthat ``forced HIV testing, even of those convicted of a crime, \ninfringes on constitutional rights and can only be justified by a \ncompelling governmental interest. No such interest is present in the \ncase of a rapist and his victim because the result of a rapist's HIV \ntest, even if accurate, will not indicate whether the rape victim has \nbeen infected.''\n  The medical facts are quite obvious why knowledge of HIV exposure is \nvital to victims of sexual assault and it is astonishing that anyone \nwould argue otherwise.\n  Claims that providing this information to victims would compromise \n``privacy'' are also quite shocking. Exactly whose rights are being \nprotected by denying a victim of sexual assault the right to know if \nshe has been exposed to the deadly AIDS virus when she was raped? If \nsufficient evidence exists to arrest and jail a rape suspect, the \nvictim should have the right to request that the suspect be tested for \nHIV.\n  Finally, the claim that testing of indicted rapists is \nunconstitutional is also unfounded. Numerous court decisions, in fact, \nhave concluded otherwise.\n  In 1997, the New Jersey Supreme Court unanimously upheld the \nconstitutionality of two state laws that require sex offenders to \nundergo HIV testing. The ruling followed the case of three boys who \nforcibly sodomized a mentally-retarded 10-year-old girl. At the request \nof the girl's guardian, HIV testing was ordered for each of the \ndefendants. The boys' public defender opposed such testing. The court \nruled that the victim's need to know outweighed the defendants' rights \nto privacy and confidentiality.\n  In December 1995, a Florida appeals court upheld the \nconstitutionality of a state law allowing judges to order defendants \ncharged with rape to submit to HIV testing. Duane Fosman was arrested \nand charged with armed sexual battery. At the request of the accuser, a \nBroward County trial judge ordered Fosman to be tested for HIV \nantibodies. Under the Florida law, a crime victim can ask a judge to \norder HIV testing of a defendant who has been charged with any one of \n12 offenses, including sexual battery. The test results are disclosed \nonly to the victim, the defendant and public health authorities. Fosman \nargued that the testing and taking of his blood amounted to an \nunreasonable search that violated the fourth amendment of the U.S. \nConstitution. He also said the action violated Article I, Section 23, \nof the Florida Constitution, which guarantees a person's right to be \nfree from Governmental intrusion in his private life. In addition, he \nasserted that the law is unconstitutional because it doesn't give him \nan opportunity to rebut the presumption of probable cause. A three-\njudge panel of the Court of Appeal, Fourth District, said Fosman's \nsituation was analogous to blood and urine testing for drug or alcohol \nuse. In 1989, the U.S. Supreme Court in Skinner v. Railway Labor \nExecutive's Association ruled it was constitutionally permissible to \ntest railroad workers who were involved in serious train crashes. In a \ncompanion case, National Treasury Employees Union v. Von Raab, the high \ncourt allowed mandatory drug testing, without probable cause, of \ncustoms employees. Under the same rationale, the Illinois Supreme Court \nupheld a law which required HIV testing of persons convicted of \nprostitution, and a California appeals court affirmed a law requiring \nHIV testing of defendants charged with biting or transferring blood to \na police officer. In each of the cases, the ``special needs'' of the \npublic outweighed the individual's demand that probable cause be \nestablished, the Florida court said. ``Even if the petitioner had a \nreasonable expectation of privacy, society's interest in preventing \nmembers of the public from being exposed to HIV would be a sufficient \ncompelling state interest to justify the infringement of that right,'' \nthe court said. It found the law to be ``the least intrusive means'' to \ndeal with HIV transmission because blood tests are routine and \ndisclosure of test results are limited.\n\n[[Page S13756]]\n\n  It is my hope that those States that do not allow victims of sexual \nassault the right to know the HIV status of their attacker will update \ntheir laws and begin protecting the rights of the victims rather than \nthe perpetrators.\n  I also thank Chairman Specter and Senator Biden for including this \nimportant provision.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today to comment on the Senate's \npassage of H.R. 3402, the Violence Against Women and Department of \nJustice Reauthorization Act of 2005. My comments are directed at Title \nX of the bill, the ``DNA Fingerprint Act of 2005.'' This provision is \nnearly identical to S. 1606, a bill of the same name that Senator \nCornyn and I introduced earlier this year. The DNA Fingerprint Act was \nadded to the Senate version of VAWA reauthorization, S. 1197, in the \nSenate Judiciary Committee on a Kyl/Cornyn amendment that was accepted \nby voice vote. I am pleased to see that this provision has been \nmaintained in the final bill.\n  The DNA Fingerprint Act will allow State and Federal law enforcement \nto catch rapists, murderers, and other violent criminals whom it \notherwise would be impossible to identify and arrest. The principal \nprovisions of the bill make it easier to include and keep the DNA \nprofiles of criminal arrestees in the National DNA Index System, where \nthat profile can be compared to crime-scene evidence. By removing \ncurrent barriers to maintaining data from criminal arrestees, the Act \nwill allow the creation of a comprehensive, robust database that will \nmake it possible to catch serial rapists and murderers before they \ncommit more crimes.\n  The impact that this act will have on preventing rape and other \nviolent crimes is not merely speculative. We know from real life \nexamples that an all-arrestee database can prevent many future \noffenses. In March of this year, the City of Chicago produced a case \nstudy of eight serial killers in that city who would have been caught \nafter their first offense--rather than after their fourth or tenth--if \nan all-arrestee database had been in place. This study is included in \nthe congressional record at the conclusion of my introduction of S. \n1606, at 151 Cong. Rec. S9529-9531 (July 29, 2005).\n  The first example that the Chicago study cites involves serial rapist \nand murderer Andre Crawford. In March 1993, Crawford was arrested for \nfelony theft. Under the DNA Fingerprint Act, the State of Illinois \nwould have been able to take a DNA sample from Crawford at that time \nand upload and keep that sample in NDIS, the national DNA database. But \nat that time--and until this bill may be enacted--Federal law makes it \ndifficult to upload an arrestee's profiles to NDIS, and bars States \nfrom keeping that profile in NDIS if the arrestee is not later \nconvicted of a criminal offense. As a result, Crawford's DNA profile \nwas not collected and it was not added to NDIS. And as a result, when \nCrawford murdered a 37-year-old woman on September 21, 1993, although \nDNA evidence was recovered from the crime scene, Crawford could not be \nidentified as the perpetrator. And as a result, Crawford went on to \ncommit many more rapes and murders.\n  On December 21, 1994, a 24-year-old woman was found murdered in an \nabandoned building on the 800 block of West 50th place in Chicago. DNA \nevidence was recovered. That DNA evidence identifies Crawford as the \nperpetrator. If the DNA Fingerprint Act had been law, and Crawford's \nprofile had been collected after his March 1993 arrest, he would have \nbeen identified as the perpetrator of the September 1993 murder, and \nthis December 1994 murder could have been prevented.\n  On April 3, 1995, a 36-year-old woman was found murdered in an \nabandoned house on the 5000 block of South Carpenter Street in Chicago. \nDNA evidence was recovered. That DNA evidence identifies Crawford as \nthe perpetrator. If the DNA Fingerprint Act had been law, and \nCrawford's profile had been collected after his March 1993 arrest, he \nwould have been identified as the perpetrator of the two earlier \nmurders that he had committed, and this April 1995 murder could have \nbeen prevented.\n  On July 23, 1997, a 27-year-old woman was found murdered in a closet \nof an abandoned house on the 900 block of West 51st Street in Chicago. \nDNA evidence was recovered. That DNA evidence identifies Crawford as \nthe perpetrator. If the DNA Fingerprint Act had been law, and \nCrawford's profile had been collected after his March 1993 arrest, he \nwould have been identified as the perpetrator of the three earlier \nmurders that he had committed, and this July 1997 murder could have \nbeen prevented.\n  On December 27, 1997, a 42-year-old woman was raped in Chicago. As \nshe walked down the street, a man approached her from behind, put a \nknife to her head, dragged her into an abandoned building on the 5100 \nblock of South Peoria Street, and beat and raped her. DNA evidence was \nrecovered. That DNA evidence identifies Crawford as the perpetrator. If \nthe DNA Fingerprint Act had been law, and Crawford's profile had been \ncollected after his March 1993 arrest, he would have been identified as \nthe perpetrator of the four earlier murders that he had committed, and \nthis December 1997 rape could have been prevented.\n  In June 1998, a 31-year-old woman was found murdered in an abandoned \nbuilding on the 5000 block of South May Street in Chicago. DNA evidence \nwas recovered. That DNA evidence identifies Crawford as the \nperpetrator. If the DNA Fingerprint Act had been law, and Crawford's \nprofile had been collected after his March 1993 arrest, he would have \nbeen identified as the perpetrator of the four earlier murders and one \nrape that he had committed, and this June 1998 murder could have been \nprevented.\n  On August 13, 1998, a 44-year-old woman was found murdered in an \nabandoned house on the 900 block of West 52nd Street. Her clothes were \nfound in the alley. DNA evidence was recovered. That DNA evidence \nidentifies Crawford as the perpetrator. If the DNA Fingerprint Act had \nbeen law, and Crawford's profile had been collected after his March \n1993 arrest, he would have been identified as the perpetrator of the \nfive earlier murders and one rape that he had committed, and this \nAugust 1998 murder could have been prevented.\n  Also on August 13, 1998, a 32-year-old woman was found murdered in \nthe attic of a house on the 5200 block of South Marshfield. Her body \nwas decomposed, but DNA evidence was recovered. That DNA evidence \nidentifies Crawford as the perpetrator. If the DNA Fingerprint Act had \nbeen law, and Crawford's profile had been collected after his March \n1993 arrest, he would have been identified as the perpetrator of the \nsix earlier murders and one rape that he had committed, and this \nadditional murder could have been prevented.\n  On December 8, 1998, a 35-year-old woman was found murdered in a \nbuilding on the 1200 block of West 52nd Street. She had rope marks \naround her neck and injuries to her face. DNA evidence was recovered. \nThat DNA evidence identifies Crawford as the perpetrator. If the DNA \nFingerprint Act had been law, and Crawford's profile had been collected \nafter his March 1993 arrest, he would have been identified as the \nperpetrator of the seven earlier murders and one rape that he had \ncommitted, and this December 1998 murder could have been prevented.\n\n  On February 2, 1999, a 35-year-old woman was found murdered on the \n1300 block of West 51st Street. DNA evidence was recovered. That DNA \nevidence identifies Crawford as the perpetrator. If the DNA Fingerprint \nAct had been law, and Crawford's profile had been collected after his \nMarch 1993 arrest, he would have been identified as the perpetrator of \nthe eight earlier murders and one rape that he had committed, and this \nFebruary 1999 murder could have been prevented.\n  On April 21, 1999, a 44-year-old woman was found murdered in the \nupstairs of an abandoned house on the 5000 block of South Justine \nStreet. DNA evidence was recovered. That DNA evidence identifies \nCrawford as the perpetrator. If the DNA Fingerprint Act had been law, \nand Crawford's profile had been collected after his March 1993 arrest, \nhe would have been identified as the perpetrator of the nine earlier \nmurders and one rape that he had committed, and this April 1999 murder \ncould have been prevented.\n  And on June 20, 1999, a 41-year-old woman was found murdered in the \nattic of an abandoned building on the 1500 block of West 51st Street. \nDNA evidence was recovered from blood on a\n\n[[Page S13757]]\n\nnearby wall, indicating a struggle. That DNA evidence identifies \nCrawford as the perpetrator. If the DNA Fingerprint Act had been law, \nand Crawford's profile had been collected after his March 1993 arrest, \nhe would have been identified as the perpetrator of the ten earlier \nmurders and one rape that he had committed, and this additional murder \ncould have been prevented.\n  As the City of Chicago case study concludes:\n\n       In January 2000, Andre Crawford was charged with 11 murders \n     and 1 Aggravated Criminal Sexual Assault. If his DNA sample \n     had been taken on March 6, 1993, the subsequent 10 murders \n     and 1 rape would not have happened.\n\n  The City of Chicago study goes on to discuss the cases of 7 other \nserial rapists and murders from that city. Each of these criminals had \na prior arrest that could have been a basis for a DNA collection but \nhad no prior conviction. Collectively, together with Andre Crawford, \nthese 8 serial rapists and killers represent 22 murders and 30 rapes \nthat could have been prevented had an all-arrestee database been in \nplace.\n  The DNA Fingerprint Act eliminates current Federal statutory \nrestrictions that prevent states from adding and keeping arrestee \nprofiles in NDIS. In effect, the Act would make it possible to build a \ncomprehensive, robust national all-arrestee DNA database.\n  Here is how the DNA Fingerprint Act works. First, the Act eliminates \ncurrent Federal statutory restrictions that prevent an arrestee's \nprofile from being included in NDIS at the same time that fingerprints \nare taken and added to the national database. Under current law, as \nsoon as someone is arrested, fingerprints can be taken as part of the \nbooking procedure and uploaded to the national database. But DNA cannot \nbe uploaded until the arrestee is charged in an indictment or \ninformation, which can take weeks. Allowing local authorities to \ncollect and upload DNA at the same time as fingerprints--as part of a \nunified procedure--establishes a clear and straightforward process, \nmaking it easier and thus more likely that states will move to an all-\narrestee database.\n  Second, current law places the burden on the State to remove an \narrestee DNA sample from NDIS if the arrestee later is acquitted or \ncharges are dismissed. The U.S. Justice Department has criticized this \nas an unwieldy requirement to impose on State labs--it effectively \nrequires lab administrators to track the progress of individual \ncriminal cases. Under the DNA Fingerprint Act, an arrestee will be \nrequired to take the initiative to have his profile removed form NDIS \nif he does not want it compared to future crime-scene evidence. The \narrestee will be required to file a certified copy of a final court \norder establishing that all indexable charges have been dismissed, have \nresulted in acquittal, or that no charges were filed within the \napplicable time period. This is the same system that some States use if \nan arrestee wants to have an arrest struck from his record. And it is \nmore restrictive of law enforcement than the rule for fingerprints--\nthere is no expungement of fingerprints from the national database, \neven if the arrestee is acquitted or charges are dismissed.\n  The bureaucratic burden imposed by the current system discourages \nStates from creating and maintaining comprehensive, all-arrestee DNA \ndatabases. It also effectively precludes the creation of a genuine \nnational all-arrestee database; only convicts' DNA profiles can be kept \nin the national database over the long term.\n  Some critics have complained that this expungement provisions in the \nDNA Fingerprint Act do not require expungement for State offenses that \nhave no statute of limitations--i.e., for offenses for which the \n``applicable time period'' does not expire. Others have complained that \nsome States may not make certified court orders available for all of \nthe scenarios under which expungement is contemplated under this bill. \nThe answer to all of these complaints is that these are questions for \nthe States to resolve. If a state chooses to abolish its statute of \nlimitations for murder, rape, or other crimes, that is the State's \ndecision to make. Certainly a person arrested for a serious crime in a \nState with no statute of limitation for the offense would be more \nsignificantly burdened the fact that he may be subject to further \narrest and prosecution at any time than by the fact that his DNA is in \nthe national database and may identify him if he commits a crime. \nSimilarly, it is up to the States to decide when certified court orders \nshould be made available to memorialize particular events. All that the \nDNA Fingerprint Act requires is that if the State does make such an \norder available to an arrestee--for example, for purposes of having an \narrest struck from his record--then the arrestee could also use that \norder to have his DNA profile removed from NDIS.\n  Third, the DNA Fingerprint Act would allow expanded use of Federal \nDNA grants. Current law only allows these grants to be used to build \ndatabases of convicted felons. The DNA Fingerprint Act permits these \ngrants to be used to analyze and database any DNA sample whose \ncollection is permitted by State or local law.\n  Fourth, the DNA Fingerprint Act allows the Federal Government to take \nand keep DNA samples from Federal arrestees and from non-U.S. persons \nwho are detained under Federal authority. (A ``United States person'' \nis a citizen of the United States or an alien lawfully admitted for \npermanent residence. See 50 U.S.C. 1801(i).) The act gives the Attorney \nGeneral the authority to issue regulations requiring the collection of \nsuch DNA profiles--including requiring other Federal agencies to \ncollect the profiles. As the National Immigration Law Center noted in \nits October commentary on this section of the Act, ``[u]nder this \nprovision, the attorney general could authorize the Dept. of Homeland \nSecurity and its immigration agencies to collect DNA samples from \nimmigrants who are arrested and `non-United States persons' who are \ndetained under the authority of the United States.'' And as the NILC's \ncommentary also notes, the word ```detained' covers a wide spectrum of \ncircumstances. The dictionary definition of `detained' is to keep from \nproceeding or to keep in custody or temporary confinement.''\n  Finally, the act tolls the statute of limitations for Federal sex \noffenses. Current law generally tolls the statute of limitations for \nfelony cases in which the perpetrator is implicated in the offense \nthrough DNA testing. The one exception to this tolling is the sexual-\nabuse offenses in chapter 109A of title 18. When Congress adopted \ngeneral tolling, it left out chapter 109A, apparently because those \ncrimes already are subject to the use of ``John Doe'' indictments to \ncharge unidentified perpetrators. The Justice Department has made \nclear, however, that John Doe indictments are ``not an adequate \nsubstitute for the applicability of [tolling].'' The Department has \ncriticized the exception in current law as ``work[ing] against the \neffective prosecution of rapes and other serious sexual assaults under \nchapter 109A,'' noting that it makes ``the statute of limitation rules \nfor such offenses more restrictive that those for all other Federal \noffenses in cases involving DNA identification.'' The DNA Fingerprint \nAct corrects this anomaly by allowing tolling for chapter 109A \noffenses.\n  Further evidence of the potential effectiveness of a comprehensive, \nrobust DNA database is available from the recent experience of the \nUnited Kingdom. The British have taken the lead in using DNA to solve \ncrimes, creating a database that now includes 2,000,000 profiles. Their \ndatabase has now reached the critical mass where it is big enough to \nserve as a highly effective tool for solving crimes. In the U.K., DNA \nfrom crime scenes produces a match to the DNA database in 40 percent of \nall cases. This amounted to 58,176 cold hits in the United Kingdom \n2001. (See generally ``The Application of DNA Technology in England and \nWales,'' a study commissioned by the National Institute of Justice.) A \nbroad DNA database works. The same tool should be made available in the \nUnited States.\n  Some critics of DNA databasing argue that a comprehensive database \nwould violate criminal suspects' privacy rights. This is simply untrue. \nThe sample of DNA that is kept in NDIS is what is called ``junk DNA''--\nit is impossible to determine anything medically sensitive from this \nDNA. For example, this DNA does not allow the tester to determine if \nthe donor is susceptible to particular diseases. The\n\n[[Page S13758]]\n\nJustice Department addressed this issue in its statement of views on S. \n1700, a DNA bill that was introduced in the 108th Congress (See Letter \nof William Moschella, Assistant Attorney General, to the Honorable \nOrrin Hatch, April 28, 2004):\n\n       [T]here [are no] legitimate privacy concerns that require \n     the retention or expansion of these [burdensome expungement \n     provisions]. The DNA identification system is already subject \n     to strict privacy rules, which generally limit the use of DNA \n     samples and DNA profiles in the system to law enforcement \n     identification purposes. See 42 U.S.C. 14132(b)-(c). \n     Moreover, the DNA profiles that are maintained in the \n     national index relate to 13 DNA sites that do not control any \n     traits or characteristics of individuals. Hence, the \n     databased information cannot be used to discern, for example, \n     anything about an individual's genetic illnesses, disorders, \n     or dispositions. Rather, by design, the information the \n     system retains in the databased DNA profiles is the \n     equivalent of a ``genetic fingerprint'' that uniquely \n     identifies an individual, but does not disclose other facts \n     about him.\n\n  In its September 29 Statement of Views on S. 1197, this year's Senate \nVAWA bill, the Justice Department commented favorably on the inclusion \nof the DNA Fingerprint Act in that bill. The Department noted:\n\n       Title X of the bill contains provisions we strongly support \n     that will strengthen the ability of the Nation's justice \n     systems to identify and prosecute sexually violent offenders \n     and other criminals through the use of the DNA technology. \n     These reforms have generally been proposed or endorsed by the \n     Department of Justice in previous communications to Congress. \n     See Letter from Assistant Attorney General William E. \n     Moschella to the Honorable Orrin G. Hatch concerning H.R. \n     3214, at 3-7 (April 28, 2004); Letter from Assistant Attorney \n     General William E. Moschella to the Honorable Orrin G. Hatch \n     concerning S. 1700, at 5-6 (April 28, 2004).\n       Section 1002 would remove unjustified restrictions on the \n     DNA profiles that can be included in the National DNA Index \n     System (``NDIS''), including elimination of language that \n     generally excludes from NDIS the DNA profiles of arrestees. \n     Section 1003 is a parallel amendment to allow the use of DNA \n     backlog elimination funding to analyze DNA samples collected \n     under applicable legal authority, not limited (as currently \n     is the case) to DNA samples collected from convicted \n     offenders. Section 1004 would authorize the Attorney General \n     to extend DNA sample collection to Federal arrestees and \n     detainees. A number of States (including California, \n     Virginia, Texas, and Louisiana) already have authorized \n     arrestee DNA sample collection under their laws. Section 1004 \n     would create legal authority to extend this beneficial reform \n     to the Federal jurisdiction. Section 1005 would strike \n     language in 18 U.S.C. section 3297 that currently makes that \n     provision's statute of limitations tolling rule for cases \n     involving DNA identification uniquely inapplicable to sexual \n     abuse offenses under chapter 109A of the Federal criminal \n     code.\n       In one respect, the amendments in section 1002, which are \n     absolutely critical to the future development and \n     effectiveness of the DNA identification system in the United \n     States, fall short of our recommendations. They moderate \n     existing expungement provisions requiring the removal of DNA \n     profiles from NDIS in certain circumstances, but do not \n     completely repeal the expungement provisions of 42 U.S.C. \n     14132(d), as we have recommended. Paragraph (2) of section \n     1002 should be amended so that it simply repeals subsection \n     (d) of 42 U.S.C. 14132. We have previously observed:\n       ``States usually do not expunge fingerprint records . . . \n     if the defendant is not convicted, or if the conviction is \n     ultimately overturned, nor are they required to remove \n     fingerprint records in such cases from the national . . . \n     criminal history records systems. There is no reason to have \n     a contrary Federal policy mandating expungement for DNA \n     information. If the person whose DNA it is does not commit \n     other crimes, then the information simply remains in a secure \n     database and there is no adverse effect on his life. But if \n     he commits a murder, rape, or other serious crime, and DNA \n     matching can identify him as the perpetrator, then it is good \n     that the information was retained.''\n\n     Letter from Assistant Attorney General William E. Moschella \n     to the Honorable Orrin G. Hatch concerning H.R. 3214, supra, \n     at 5; see 150 Cong. Rec. S10914-15 (Oct. 9, 2004) (remarks of \n     Senator Cornyn).\n       We note with approval that the Committee has made the \n     salutary reforms of title X that expand the collection and \n     indexing of DNA samples and information generally applicable, \n     and has not confined the application of these reforms to \n     cases involving violent felonies or some other limited class \n     of offenses. The experience with DNA identification over the \n     past fifteen years has provided overwhelming evidence that \n     the efficacy of the DNA identification system in solving \n     serious crimes depends upon casting a broad DNA sample \n     collection net to produce well-populated DNA databases. For \n     example, the DNA profile which solves a rape through database \n     matching very frequently was not collected from the \n     perpetrator based upon his prior conviction for a violent \n     crime, but rather based upon his commission of some property \n     offense that was not intrinsically violent. As a result of \n     this experience, a great majority of the States, as well as \n     the Federal jurisdiction, have adopted authorizations in \n     recent years to collect DNA samples from all convicted \n     felons--and in some cases additional misdemeanant categories \n     as well--without limitation to violent offenses. See, e.g., \n     42 U.S.C. 14135a(d)(l). The principle is equally applicable \n     to the collection of DNA samples from non-convicts, such as \n     arrestees. By rejecting any limitation of the proposed \n     reforms to cases involving violent felonies or other limited \n     classes, the Committee has soundly maximized their value in \n     solving rapes, murders, and other serious crimes.\n\n(Letter of William Moschella, Assistant Attorney General, to the \nHonorable Arlen Specter, September 29, 2005.)\n  I note with pride that in addition to receiving the strong support of \nthe Justice Department, the DNA Fingerprint Act is endorsed by the \nRape, Abuse, and Incest National Network, Debbie and Rob Smith, and the \nCalifornia District Attorneys Association. I include in the Record at \nthe conclusion of my remarks letters from these individuals and \norganizations supporting the DNA Fingerprint Act.\n  I would also like to comment on an issue that I chose not to address \nin the DNA Fingerprint Act but that I may need to address in future \nlegislation. This matter concerns the efficient use of the limited \nFederal dollars available for offender DNA analysis. Some State crime \nlaboratories recently have been required to remove criminal offender \nprofiles from the national DNA database system because of Federal \nregulations that require a 100 percent technical review of offender DNA \nsamples tested by private DNA laboratories, rather than review of a \nrandom sampling. Given that private laboratories must meet the same \naccreditation and quality assurance standards as public laboratories in \norder to test samples for CODIS, and given that these quality assurance \nstandards include the same reviews of DNA analysis reports which are \nrequired of public laboratories, I question why the additional 100 \npercent review is required.\n  Moreover, offender DNA samples are not themselves considered \nevidence. After matched to an unsolved case on CODIS, regulations \nrequire that the offender sample be reanalyzed to confirm the match and \nthen a new sample is collected from the suspect and tested anew to \nreconfirm the match. DNA cases with named suspects tested by accredited \nprivate laboratories are routinely brought directly to court without \nthe duplicated public laboratory review requirement. If these private \nlaboratories can be trusted to perform quality analysis for the \nthousands of DNA cases that have resulted in conviction for over 15 \nyears, then it stands to reason that they could also be trusted with \ndatabase samples which will be reanalyzed twice after a match is made.\n  While I understand the concern that potential incorrect results from \nan offender's sample could lead to a missed opportunity to solve a \ncrime, I also am concerned about the potential for additional crimes to \noccur while an offender's profile is queued in a laboratory review \nbacklog. It has been brought to my attention that there are other \nforensic disciplines, such as drug chemistry, in which laboratories use \nstatistically based formulas to achieve a high degree of certainty \nwithout requiring a 100 percent review of all samples. I also am aware \nthat the National Institute of Justice already requires that outsourced \nDNA samples include a requirement for five percent of a given batch to \nbe blind samples.\n  This duplicated requirement for review of samples tested at private \nlaboratories appears to be an inefficient use of federal funds and, \nmore importantly, delays justice for victims seeking a name for their \nattacker. Before--and ideally, instead of--my introducing legislation \nto address what appears to be a non-statutory problem, I would suggest \nthat the Attorney General and the FBI reevaluate the necessity for this \nregulation. The Justice Department also ought to consider the \npossibility of permitting accredited private laboratories limited but \ndirect ability to upload data to the national DNA Index System, similar \nto the permission granted to private laboratories in the United \nKingdom's DNA database system.\n  Finally, I would like to thank those who have made it possible to \nenact the\n\n[[Page S13759]]\n\nDNA Fingerprint Act as part of this year's VAWA reauthorization bill. \nThis includes my colleague, Senator Cornyn, with whom I introduced S. \n1606 and who offered the Kyl amendment on my behalf at the Judiciary \nCommittee's executive meeting; Chip Roy and Reed O'Connor of Senator \nCornyn's staff; and Lisa Owings and Brett Tolman of Chairman Specter's \nstaff. It is my understanding that absent some aggressive staffing by \nMr. Tolman at various stages of the legislative process, the effort to \nhave the DNA Fingerprint Act enacted into law as part of VAWA this year \nwould not have succeeded. His contribution is duly noted and \nappreciated.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following letters be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     Rape, Abuse & Incest National\n\n\n                                                      Network,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, August 24, 2005.\n     Senator Jon Kyl,\n     Hart Senate Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kyl: Thank you for introducing the DNA \n     Fingerprint Act of 2005 and for your continuing leadership in \n     the crucial effort to expand the use of DNA to fight crime. \n     RAINN is pleased to offer its support for this important \n     legislation.\n       The Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN) is the \n     nation's largest anti-sexual assault organization. RAINN \n     created and operates the National Sexual Assault Hotline and \n     also publicizes the hotline's free, confidential services; \n     educates the public about sexual assault; and leads national \n     efforts to improve services to victims and ensure that \n     rapists are brought to justice.\n       The Debbie Smith Act provisions of the Justice for All Act, \n     which Congress passed last year due, in large measure, to \n     your leadership, made great progress in expanding the \n     nation's use of DNA evidence to identify criminals. As the \n     DNA evidence from 542,000 backlogged crimes is analyzed, and \n     as states collect more DNA samples from convicted offenders, \n     the FBI's Combined DNA Index System (CODIS) databases \n     continue to grow. With each record added, the potential to \n     identify the perpetrators of future crimes expands as well.\n       The DNA Fingerprint Act of 2005, as introduced by Senator \n     Cornyn and yourself, will make it easier to include and \n     retain the DNA profiles of criminal arrestees in the National \n     DNA Index System (NDIS). The DNA Fingerprint Act will \n     eliminate the current restrictions that prevent an arrestee's \n     profile from being included in NDIS as soon as he is charged \n     in a pleading. The legislation encourages law enforcement to \n     take DNA from those arrested for violent crimes, and allows \n     these profiles to be uploaded to NDIS.\n       By improving the value of NDIS, which can be compared to \n     crime-scene evidence across the country, law enforcement will \n     be able to identify--and apprehend, convict and incarcerate \n     countless serial rapists and murderers before they commit \n     additional crimes.\n       Your legislation makes other valuable changes to current \n     law, by expanding the use of CODIS grants to build arrestee \n     databases; giving the Attorney General the authority to \n     develop regulations for collecting DNA profiles from federal \n     arrestees and detainees; and tolling the statute of \n     limitations for Federal sex offenses when DNA evidence is \n     available, which will allow prosecution to proceed once a \n     match is made to a perpetrator.\n       The bill is mindful of the fact that police, like everyone, \n     occasionally make mistakes. For those times when an innocent \n     person is mistakenly charged, the bill appropriately provides \n     the exonerated person a means of expunging his DNA profile \n     from the database.\n       RAINN believes that the DNA Fingerprint Act of 2005 makes \n     important changes to current law, and will significantly \n     enhance law enforcement's ability to identify and capture \n     serial violent criminals. By making it easier to catch \n     criminals, while still protecting the rights of the innocent, \n     the DNA Fingerprint Act will make our nation safer. We will \n     urge all members of Congress to support this legislation.\n       Once again, thank you for your important, and effective, \n     work fighting violent crime. I would also like to offer a \n     note of praise for your counsel, Joe Matal, whose work on DNA \n     policy has been invaluable.\n           Best regards,\n                                                  Scott Berkowitz,\n     President and Founder.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                              H-E-A-R-T, Inc.,\n\n                             Williamsburg, VA, September 19, 2005.\n     Senator Jon Kyl,\n     Hart Senate Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kyl: My husband, Rob and I have truly come to \n     appreciate the work you do on a continuing basis to help \n     victims of crime. Most recently, your introduction of the DNA \n     Fingerprint Act of 2005 is a wonderful addition to these \n     efforts. Our organization, H-E-A-R-T, Inc., stands fully \n     behind this important piece of legislation.\n       Your leadership was a major factor in the passage of the \n     Justice for All Act of 2004, which with the provisions of the \n     Debbie Smith Act portion of the bill, provided a boost to our \n     nation's use of DNA evidence to fight crime.\n       Your legislation will help to expand the use of CODIS \n     grants, which will help to build the arrestee database. It \n     will improve NDIS which enables law enforcement across this \n     great country to be more efficient in apprehending and \n     convicting the ``right'' person. It will also limit the \n     incidents of wrongful arrest, while enabling those who are \n     exonerated to have their samples expunged from the database.\n       As a victim of rape, I salute both you and Senator Cornyn \n     for introducing this legislation. There will also be \n     countless other victims who will one day thank you both if \n     you succeed in passing this very important bill.\n       H-E-A-R-T, Inc. will stand behind you and this bill and \n     will encourage others in Congress to join in this fight \n     against crime. Rob and I want to once again thank you \n     personally for your efforts in putting away violent \n     offenders.\n           With the highest of regards,\n     Debbie Smith.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 October 11, 2005.\n     Re Request To Support the Federal DNA Fingerprint Act\n\n     The Hon. James Sensenbrenner, Jr.,\n     House of Representatives, Rayburn House Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sensenbrenner: The California District \n     Attorneys Association (CDAA) strongly supports the VAWA \n     reauthorization bill. CDAA represents 58 elected district \n     attorneys, eight elected city attorneys, and almost 3,000 \n     deputy prosecutors throughout California. The VAWA \n     reauthorization bill contains several provisions that are of \n     critical need to prosecutors and the rest of law enforcement. \n     In particular, the measure contains the ``DNA Fingerprint \n     Act'' which would greatly enhance investigators' ability to \n     identity suspects of violent crimes and prosecutors' ability \n     to hold them fully accountable. Therefore, CDAA respectfully \n     urges you to include this important public safety amendment \n     in your final conference report.\n       DNA technology is one of the most powerful criminal justice \n     tools available. This technology is able to positively \n     identify criminal offenders, including murderers and rapists, \n     who may be mere suspects in criminal investigations or who \n     have not yet been linked to a crime due to lack of other \n     evidence. DNA technology should be used to its fullest \n     capability so that prosecutors are able to hold offenders \n     accountable for their crimes and prevent innocent people from \n     becoming victimized.\n       The Federal DNA Act will allow states to take advantage of \n     such advances. It will expand the federal DNA database to \n     include information collected from arrestees and convicted \n     felons. The federal database will include both samples \n     collected by federal investigators as well as samples that \n     are uploaded by states like California into the National DNA \n     index a suspect is arrested or convicted. The Act will \n     significantly expand the DNA information that is available to \n     states and to the federal government for the prosecution of \n     state and federal crimes.\n       The Federal DNA Act is particularly important to California \n     prosecutors. November 2005 marks the first year anniversary \n     of a CDAA drafted and sponsored DNA initiative, Proposition \n     69, that passed by overwhelming support of voters and changed \n     the landscape of the criminal justice system in California. \n     This measure requires law enforcement officials to collect \n     DNA samples from all convicted felons, from misdemeanor sex \n     offenders, from all murder and violent sex offender arrestees \n     and, beginning in 2009, from all felon arrestees. So far, \n     this has increased the California database to nearly 500,000 \n     DNA profiles. This means that more profiles are available to \n     be compared to crime scene evidence, and since a great \n     majority of convicted felons are repeat offenders, \n     particularly sex offenders, this will enable more cases to be \n     solved.\n       California now collects DNA samples from arrestee murder \n     and rape suspects, and in 2009, will collect samples from all \n     felon arrestees. The Federal DNA Act will give other states \n     and the federal government access to the California's \n     arrestee database. Furthermore, it will give California \n     access to DNA profiles analyzed by other states with arrestee \n     databases and to the profiles of arrestees analyzed by the \n     federal government. Without the arrestee provision in the \n     Federal DNA Act, arrestee DNA profiles can only be used by \n     the state which collects them, so that the ability to \n     maximize the benefits of this extraordinary national crime \n     fighting technology will be completely wasted. This is a \n     dangerous proposition considering many of the most violent \n     sex offenders travel from state to state to commit crimes and \n     avoid prosecution. The technology exists to identify and \n     track these criminals and it would be a shame to not utilize \n     it.\n       In drafting Proposition 69, CDAA included an expungement \n     provision, giving criminal suspects the ability to make a \n     showing to the courts to get their samples removed from the \n     database. Furthermore, CDAA is in the process of creating an \n     easy-to-use form for suspects to fill out and file with the \n     courts to assist those who claim their samples do not belong \n     in the database. This burden appropriately belongs on \n     criminal suspects, who are the only ones aware of the entire \n     breadth of their own criminal history.\n\n[[Page S13760]]\n\n       If Proposition 69 included an expungement process that was \n     automatic rather than triggered by a petition filed by a \n     suspect, it would be a bureaucratic nightmare to enforce. Law \n     enforcement officials would have to thoroughly investigate \n     each and every aspect of a suspect's criminal history, which \n     would include the burden to discover whether the suspect had \n     ever committed any qualifying crime in any other state. This \n     would increase the workload tremendously for law enforcement \n     officials who are already struggling to do their jobs with \n     limited resources. On the other hand, a suspect should be \n     aware of his or her complete criminal background without this \n     same burden and should be willing to bring this information \n     forward with any claim that they should be excluded from the \n     database.\n       If this burden were placed on the prosecution instead, \n     these same dilemmas would exist. Furthermore, without any \n     real justification the prosecution could be accused of \n     delaying the expungement process in order to have the testing \n     completed. If a ``hit'' were to occur during a legislatively \n     mandated expungement process, it would likely cause recusal \n     of the prosecution's office or possible suppression of DNA \n     evidence--which would defeat the usefulness of DNA as a crime \n     fighting tool. Placing the burden on the courts, presents the \n     same sort of challenges. In fact, courts are not even aware \n     of arrestee samples until a criminal case has been filed.\n       The Federal DNA Act was drafted with an expungement \n     procedure similar to California's. The Act does not require \n     states to expunge profiles unless suspects are able to make a \n     showing that all charges against them were dismissed or \n     resulted in an acquittal, or that no charges were filed \n     within the applicable time period.\n       Lastly, the Federal DNA Act provides states with DNA \n     backlog elimination grants so that states can clear backlogs \n     of DNA samples that await analysis. These resources will help \n     solve crimes that were committed even decades ago by matching \n     DNA evidence left behind at crime scenes, like saliva from \n     cigarette butts or strands of hair, to the database. Cold \n     cases will be closed and those who have escaped justice will \n     finally be prosecuted. Ultimately, this provision will \n     identify and remove dangerous offenders from the streets and \n     make our neighborhoods safer.\n       Thank you for your leadership in public safety. Please feel \n     free to contact me anytime regarding this or any other \n     criminal justice matter.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                     David LaBahn,\n                                    Executive Director, California\n                                   District Attorneys Association.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my appreciation to \nmy colleagues for passing for the second time this session, the \nViolence Against Women Act of 2005. Once again the Senate has spoken \nloudly and clearly that domestic violence and sexual assault are \nserious, public crimes that must be addressed. Today's bill is a \ntremendous compromise measure that merges the comprehensive, Senate-\npassed Violence Against Women Act, S. 119, with the House of \nRepresentative's Department of Justice Appropriations Authorization Act \nbill, H.R. 3402. This merger followed hours of bipartisan, bicameral \nnegotiations. Compromises and edits were made, and what emerges is a \nbalanced bill that strikes the right balance between rejuvenating core \nprograms, making targeted improvements, and responsibly expanding the \nViolence Against Women Act to reach the needs of America's families.\n  The enactment of the Violence Against Women Act in 1994 was the \nbeginning of a historic commitment to women and children victimized by \ndomestic violence and sexual assault. While not the single cause, this \ncommitment has made our streets and homes safer. Since the Act's \npassage in 1994, domestic violence has dropped by almost 50 percent \nincidents of rape are down by 60 percent and the number of women killed \nby an abusive husband or boyfriend is down by 22 percent. Today, more \nthan half of all rape victims are stepping forward to report the crime. \nAnd since we passed the Act in 1994, over a million women have found \njustice in our courtrooms and obtained domestic violence protection \norders.\n  This is a dramatic change from a decade ago. Back then, violence in \nthe household was treated as a ``family matter'' rather than a criminal \njustice issue. Because we took action, the criminal justice system is \nmuch better equipped to handle domestic violence, and it is treated for \nwhat it is--criminal. The goal of the legislation passed here today is \nto usher the Violence Against Women Act into the 21st century. With \nthis bill we attempt to look beyond the immediate crisis and take steps \nto not only punish offenders, but to also help victims get their lives \nback on track, and prevent domestic violence and sexual assault from \noccurring in the first place.\n  The bill contains much to commend. To that end, I will ask unanimous \nconsent to include at the close of my statement a thorough section-by-\nsection summary of H.R. 3402, but in the meantime, I would like to \nhighlight some of the bill's provisions.\n  Title I, the bill's backbone, focuses on the criminal justice system \nand includes provisions to: (1) renew and increase funding to over $400 \nmillion a year for existing, fundamental grant programs for law \nenforcement, lawyers, judges and advocates; (2) stiffen existing \ncriminal penalties for repeat federal domestic violence offenders; and \n(3) appropriately update the criminal law on stalking to incorporate \nnew surveillance technology like Global Positioning System, GPS.\n  Notably, our bill reauthorizes the Court Appointed Special Advocates, \n``CASA,'' a nationwide volunteer program to help children in the \njudicial system. Children are doubly impacted by family violence--both \nas observers of, and recipients of abuse. Court Appointed Special \nAdvocates fit uniquely into the mix of services for victims of \nviolence. Judges overwhelmingly report that children and families are \nbetter served by the involvement of a CASA volunteer on their cases. I \nhope that my colleagues see fit to fully appropriate this effective \nprogram, and in the future, raise the program's authorization level.\n  The Violence Against Women Act has always included measures to help \nlaw enforcement and victim service providers reach underserved \ncommunities. Today's bill goes even further by creating a new, targeted \nculturally and linguistically specific service grant program. This \nprovision is intended to ensure that the Act's resources reach racial \nand ethnic communities grappling with family violence and its enormous \nramifications.\n  The Violence Against Women Act crafts a coordinated community \nresponse that seeks the participation of police, judges, prosecutors, \nand the host of entities who care for the victims. Title II helps \nvictim service providers by: (1) creating a new, dedicated grant \nprogram for sexual assault victims that will strengthen rape crisis \ncenters across the country; (2) reinvigorating programs to help older \nand disabled victims of domestic violence; (3) strengthening and \nexpanding existing programs for rural victims and victims in \nunderserved areas; and (4) removing a current cap on funding for the \nNational Domestic Violence Hotline.\n  Sexual violence is a crime that affects children and adults across \nour country. Unfortunately, rape has been a crime shrouded in secrecy \nand shame. Sexual assault survivors can experience physical and \nemotional problems for years. Approximately 1,315 rape crisis centers \nacross the country help victims of rape, sexual assault, sexual abuse, \nand incest rebuild their lives by providing a range of vital services \nto survivors. But unfortunately, many rape crisis centers are under \nfunded and understaffed. They are constantly in a crisis mode, \nresponding to the needs of all victims--male, female as well as \nchildren--and are incapable of undertaking large-scale prevention \nefforts in their communities.\n  In response to this overwhelming need, our bill will provide \nincreased resources to serve sexual assault victims. It includes, for \nthe first time, a dedicated Federal funding stream for sexual assault \nprograms through the proposed Sexual Assault Services Program, SASA. \nSASA will fund direct services to victims, including general \nintervention and advocacy, accompaniment through the medical and \ncriminal justice processes, support services, and related assistance.\n  Reports indicate that up to ten million children experience domestic \nviolence in their homes each year. The age at which a female is at \ngreatest risk for rape or sexual assault is 14. Two-thirds of all \nsexual assault victims reported to law enforcement are under 18, and \nnational research suggests that 1 in 5 high-school girls is physically \nor sexually abused by a dating partner. Treating children who witness \ndomestic violence, dealing effectively with violent teenage \nrelationships and teaching prevention strategies to children are keys \nto ending the cycle of violence. This reauthorization takes bold steps \nto address the needs of young\n\n[[Page S13761]]\n\npeople by renewing successful programs and creating new programs to: \n(1) promote collaboration between domestic violence experts and child \nwelfare agencies; and (2) enhance to $15 million a year grants to \nreduce violence against women on college campuses.\n  Critical prevention initiatives are contained in title IV, including \nprograms supporting home visitations for families at risk, and \ninitiatives that specifically engage men and boys in efforts to end \ndomestic and sexual violence. We can no longer be satisfied with \npunishing abusers after the fact and trying to help a woman pull her \nlife back together--we must end the violence before it ever starts. We \nmust end it, not just mend it.\n  Violence against women is a health care issue of enormous proportions \nwith one in three women expected to experience such violence at some \npoint in their lives. It also has enormous health consequences for \nwomen and children, leading to serious injuries and disease, including \nsubstance abuse, chronic, serious pain and sexually transmitted \ninfections including HIV/AIDS. We know pregnant women are particularly \nat risk for violence with increased levels of abuse accounting for \ninjuries to the mother and developing fetus. In fact, homicide is a \nleading cause of death for pregnant and recently pregnant women.\n  Consequently, doctors and nurses, like police officers on the beat, \nare often the first witnesses of the devastating aftermath of abuse. \nUnfortunately, most health care providers are not currently trained on \nhow to screen for, identify, document and treat or refer for violence-\nrelated illnesses or injuries. That's why the new health care programs \nin the Act are so essential--they provide an opportunity to intervene \nmuch earlier in the cycle of violence, before it becomes life \nthreatening, and they provide a chance to reach out to children who may \nbe growing up in violent homes.\n  In some instances, women face the untenable choice of returning to \ntheir abuser or becoming homeless. Indeed, 44 percent of the nation's \nmayors identified domestic violence as a primary cause of homelessness. \nEfforts to ease the housing problems for battered women are contained \nin Title VI, including (1) $20 million grant programs to facilitate \ncollaboration between domestic violence organizations and housing \nproviders; (2) programs to combat family violence in public and \nassisted housing, including new requirements that domestic violence \nvictims may not be evicted or cut off from voucher services because of \nthe violence; and (3) enhancements to transitional housing resources.\n  In some instances, victims of domestic violence who apply for or \nreside in public and subsidized housing are evicted or turned away \nbecause of the violence against them. A scream for help, a shot being \nfired, or the sound of police sirens is cited as a ``disruptive sound'' \njustifying eviction. In a recent nationwide survey, local housing and \ndomestic violence attorneys across the country reported over 500 \ndocumented cases where victims were evicted because of the domestic \nviolence committed against them.\n  Sections 606 and 607 of the Act provide important protections in \npublic housing and the Section 8 program for victims of domestic \nviolence and stalking. These sections prohibit denial of housing \nassistance based on the individual's status as a victim of domestic \nviolence, dating violence, or stalking. With certain exceptions, they \nalso prohibit terminating a victim's tenancy or rental assistance \nbecause of the violence against him or her. When women know they may \nlose their homes if their housing provider learns about the violence, \nthey will seek to keep the abuse secret at all costs and thus, will \noften be unable to take the steps necessary to keep themselves and \ntheir families safe.\n  While protecting victims against retaliation, Sections 606 and 607 \npermit public housing authorities and private landlords to evict or end \nvoucher assistance to perpetrators of domestic violence. It also \nensures that landlords and housing providers can effectively manage \ntheir properties and maintain important discretionary authority. The \nAct allows landlords to bifurcate a lease to remove a perpetrator while \nmaintaining a victim's tenancy and evict victims who commit other lease \nviolations or if the tenancy creates an actual and imminent threat to \nthe public safety. Further, the Act clarifies that landlords should not \nbe held liable simply for complying with the statute. Sections 606 and \n607 benefited greatly from the input by the national associations \nrepresenting landlords and U.S. Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment, including the National Association of Realtors, the \nNational Multi-Housing Council, and the National Leased Housing \nAssociation.\n\n  It may be useful if the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment issues guidance or regulations to assist with the \nimplementation of these sections. Certain nonprofit organizations and \nother government agencies that have expertise in domestic violence, \ndating violence, sexual assault or stalking, or in housing law and \npolicy, could provide valuable guidance to HUD in creating such \nguidance and regulations.\n  Title VII helps abused women maintain economic security by \nestablishing a national resource center to provide information to \nemployers and labor organizations so that they may effectively help \ntheir employees who are victims of domestic violence. I had hoped that \nprovisions from Senator Murray's Security and Financial Empowerment \nAct, SAFE, would have remained in the bill. This amendment would \nprovide some fundamental economic protections for victims of domestic \nviolence and sexual assault. Just as the Family Medical Leave Act \nprotects individuals caring for a sick loved one, the SAFE Act would \nallow domestic violence victims to take time off from work to appear in \ncourt cases and other judicial proceedings without jeopardizing their \nemployment at a time they need it the most. It is my hope that the \nSenate will revisit this issue soon.\n  Immigrant women often face a difficult time escaping abuse because of \nimmigration laws, language barriers, and social isolation. Title VIII \nof today's bill builds on the progress of VAWA 1994 and VAWA 2000 to \nremove obstacles hinder or prevent immigrants from fleeing domestic \nabuse and participating in prosecutions. Further, the bill expands VAWA \nrelief to: (1) elder abuse victims who have been abused by adult U.S. \ncitizen sons or daughters; and (2) victims of child abuse or incest who \nare less than 25 and would have qualified as child self-petitioners. It \nwill allow adopted children who have been abused by an adoptive parent \nto obtain permanent residency without having to reside with the abusive \nparent for 2 years. In an important move to help battered immigrant \nwomen achieve desperately-needed economic stability, the bill permits \nemployment authorization to battered women and abused spouses of \ncertain nonimmigrants.\n  Title VIII enhances immigration protection for victims of trafficking \nby removing barriers that block some victims from accessing to T and U \nvisas. Title VIII also facilitates the reunion of trafficking victims \nwith their family members abroad who are in danger of retaliation from \ninternational traffickers, and will increase access to permanent \nresidency for victims of severe forms of trafficking who are \ncooperating in trafficking prosecutions. Finally, title VIII will arm \nforeign fiancees with background information about their U.S. citizen \nfiance, and will educate foreign fiancees about U.S. domestic violence \nlaws and resources.\n  In an effort to focus more closely on violence against Indian women, \ntitle IX creates a new tribal Deputy Director in the Office on Violence \nAgainst Women dedicated to coordinating Federal policy and tribal \ngrants. It also authorizes the Office to pool funds available to tribes \nand tribal organizations in various VAWA programs. In addition, Title \nIX authorizes tribal governments to access and upload domestic violence \nand protection order data on criminal databases, as well as create \ntribal sex offender registries, and strengthens available criminal \npenalties.\n  No doubt, today's bill is comprehensive; it speaks to the many \ncomplexities presented by domestic violence and sexual assault. I am \nindebted to a whole host of groups who worked on this measure and/or \nvoiced their support throughout the journey from introduction to \npassage, including the American Bar Association, the National \nAssociation of Attorneys General, the International Association of \nForensic Nurses, the American Medical Association, the National \nSheriffs Association, the National Coalition\n\n[[Page S13762]]\n\nAgainst Domestic Violence, the National Congress of American Indians, \nthe National Network to End Domestic Violence, the Family Violence \nPrevention Fund, Legal Momentum, the National Alliance to End Sexual \nViolence, the National Center for Victims for Crime, the National \nDistrict Attorneys Association, the National Council on Family and \nJuvenile Court Judges, the National Association of Chiefs of Police, \nand many others. I am grateful for the work each of you does each day \nto make our families safer and healthier.\n  The legislation being passed today also demonstrates Congress's \ncommitment to the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services, COPS. \nThis program has been widely credited for helping to reduce crime rates \nover the past 10 years. It was deemed a ``miraculous success'' by \nAttorney General Ashcroft, and law enforcement experts from top to \nbottom, including Attorney General Gonzalez, police chiefs, and \nsheriffs, have all testified to its effectiveness at combating crime. \nWhile many politicians have argued this point, the Government \nAccountability Office conclusively established a statistical link \nbetween COPS hiring grants and crime reductions. We know that the COPS \nprogram works, and the legislation we are passing today recognizes this \nfact by re-authorizing the COPS program for the next 5 years at $1.05 \nbillion per year.\n  In addition, this legislation also updates the COPS program grant \nmaking authority by providing more flexibility for local agencies in \napplying for assistance. It still includes many of the hallmarks that \nattributed to its success, such as reducing redtape by allowing local \nagencies to apply directly to the Federal Government for assistance, \nand providing grants on a three-year basis to facilitate long-term \nplanning. The major improvement is that agencies will now be able to \nsubmit one application for its various funding needs, including hiring \nofficers, purchase equipment, pay officers' overtime, and other \nprograms that will increase the number of officers deployed in \ncommunity oriented policing services. Originally, agencies had to make \nseparate grant applications for the various purpose areas of the \nprogram. In addition, it allows the COPS program to award grants for \nofficers hired to perform intelligence, anti-terror, or homeland \nsecurity duties. Providing local agencies with this type of flexibility \nis a step forward.\n  While re-authorizing the COPS program is important, the next step is \nfor the appropriators to fund the program at authorized levels. Back in \nthe nineties, we invested roughly $2.1 billion for state and local law \nenforcement each year. We are safer today because of these investments. \nOver the past 5 years, we have adopted a wrong-headed approach of \ncutting funding for our state and local law enforcement partners. And, \nthe recently passed Commerce, Justice, Science budget allocated less \nthan $800 million for state and local law enforcement assistance, and \nit zeroed out the COPS hiring program. I agree with the International \nAssociation of Chiefs of Police and the National Sheriffs Association \nthat these cuts leave us more vulnerable to crime and terrorism. In \nthis bill, the Congress demonstrated its support for the COPS program, \nbut the real test will come when we make funding decisions in the \nfuture. For the safety and security of the American people, I will be \nfighting for the Congress to fully fund the COPS program at the newly \nauthorized levels of $1.05 billion per year.\n  I have many partners here in the Senate and in the House of \nRepresentatives who have worked tirelessly on this bill. Chairman \nSensenbrenner and Ranking Member Conyers were committed to \nreauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act, and spent countless hours \nworking on a resolution. Our negotiations were model ones--I wish \nbicameral relations were always so easy.\n  Senator Reed and Senator Allard were very helpful on the act's \nhousing provisions, and Senator Enzi helped craft some of the victim \nservice providers. I appreciate their assistance and help to move this \nbill forward. With respect to the Native American provisions, Senator \nMcCain and Senator Dorgan provided instrumental guidance.\n  Since 1990, Senator Hatch and I have worked together to end family \nviolence in this country, so it is no great surprise that once again he \nworked side-by-side with us to craft today's bill. I am also deeply \nindebted to Senator Kennedy for his unwavering commitment to battered \nimmigrant women and his work on the bill's immigration provisions. \nSenator Kennedy's staff, particularly Janice Kaguyutan, have been \ninvaluable to this process. I also thank Senator Leahy who has long-\nsupported the Violence Against Women Act and, in particular, has worked \non the rural programs and transitional housing provisions. As Ranking \nMember of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Leahy has consistently \npushed forward reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, and \nhis staff, chief counsel Bruce Cohen, Tara Magner, and Jessica Berry \nhave worked hard for passage. My final appreciation is for my very good \nfriend from Pennsylvania for his commitment and leadership on this \nbill. It is a pleasure to work with Chairman Specter, and his staff \nBrett Tolman, Lisa Owings, Joe Jacquot, Juria Jones and chief counsel \nMike O'Neill. From day one, Chairman Specter has been one of this \nbill's biggest champion. Chairman Specter is the reason a bipartisan, \nbicameral compromise measure is being passed today and I thank him.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the section-by-section \nanalysis be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Section-by-Section Summary of the Violence Against Women Act of 2005\n\n       Sec. 1. Short Title.\n       Sec. 2. Table of Contents.\n       Sec. 3. Universal Definitions and Grant Conditions. This \n     section aggregates existing and new definitions of terms \n     applicable to the Act. (Previously, relevant definitions were \n     scattered in various Code provisions.) The section also sets \n     forth universal conditions that apply to the Act's new and \n     existing grant program.\n\n\nTitle I Enhancing Judicial and Law Enforcement Tools to Combat Violence \n                             Against Women\n\n       Sec. 101. STOP (Services and Training for Officers and \n     Prosecutors) Grants Improvements. This section reauthorizes \n     the cornerstone of the Act, the STOP program, at $225,000,000 \n     annually for 2007 through 2011 (it is currently authorized at \n     $185 million annually). This program provides state formula \n     grants that bring police and prosecutors in close \n     collaboration with victim services providers. Technical \n     amendments increase the focus on appropriate services for \n     underserved communities and ensure victim confidentiality.\n       Sec. 102. Grants to Encourage Arrest and Enforcement of \n     Protection Order Improvements. This fundamental Department of \n     Justice program is reauthorized at $75,000,000 annually for \n     2007 through 2011 (it is currently authorized at $65 million \n     annually). States and localities use this funding to develop \n     and strengthen programs and policies that encourage police \n     officers to arrest abusers who commit acts of violence or \n     violate protection orders. Amendments will provide technical \n     assistance to improve tracking of cases in a manner that \n     preserves confidentiality and privacy protections for \n     victims. Purposes are amended to encourage victim service \n     programs to collaborate with law enforcement to assist pro-\n     arrest and protection order enforcement policies. In \n     addition, this section authorizes family justice centers and \n     extends pro-arrest policies to sexual assault cases.\n       Sec. 103. Legal Assistance for Victims Improvement. This \n     section reauthorizes the grant program for legal services for \n     protection orders and related family, criminal, immigration, \n     administrative agency, and housing matters. It allows victims \n     of domestic violence, dating violence, stalking, and sexual \n     assault to obtain access to trained attorneys and lay \n     advocacy services, particularly pro bono legal services, when \n     they require legal assistance as a consequence of violence. \n     This program has been expanded to provide services to both \n     adult and youth victims. Previously authorized at $40,000,000 \n     annually, funding is set at $65,000,000 annually for 2007 \n     through 2011, to be administered by the Attorney General. \n     This provision also includes an amendment to ensure that all \n     legal services organizations can assist any victim of \n     domestic violence, sexual assault and trafficking without \n     regard to the victim's immigration status. The organizations \n     can use any source of funding they receive to provide legal \n     assistance that is directly related to overcoming the \n     victimization, and preventing or obtaining relief for the \n     crime perpetrated against them that is often critical to \n     promoting victim safety.\n       Sec. 104. Ensuring Crime Victim Access to Legal Services. \n     This section eases access to legal services for immigrant \n     victims of violent crimes.\n       Sec. 105. The Violence Against Women Act Court Training and \n     Improvements. This section creates a new program to educate \n     the\n\n[[Page S13763]]\n\n     courts and court-related personnel in the areas of domestic \n     violence, dating violence, sexual abuse and stalking. The \n     goal of this education will be to improve internal civil and \n     criminal court functions, responses, practices and \n     procedures, including the development of dedicated domestic \n     violence dockets. This section will also authorize one or \n     more grants to create general educational curricula for state \n     and tribal judiciaries to ensure that all states have access \n     to consistent and appropriate information. This section is \n     authorized at $5,000,000 for each fiscal year 2007 through \n     2011 and it is administered by the Department of Justice.\n       Sec. 106. Full Faith and Credit Improvements. Technical \n     amendments are made to the criminal code to clarify that \n     courts should enforce the protection orders issued by civil \n     and criminal courts in other jurisdictions. Orders to be \n     enforced include those issued to both adult and youth \n     victims, including the custody and child support provisions \n     of protection orders. Amendment also requires protection \n     order registries to safeguard the confidentiality and privacy \n     of victims.\n       Sec. 107. Privacy Protections For Victims of Domestic \n     Violence, Sexual Violence, Stalking, and Dating Violence. \n     This section creates new and badly-needed protections for \n     victim information collected by federal agencies and included \n     in national databases by prohibiting grantees from disclosing \n     such information. It creates grant programs and specialized \n     funding for federal programs to develop ``best practices'' \n     for ensuring victim confidentiality and safety when law \n     enforcement information (such as protection order issuance) \n     is included in federal and state databases. It also provides \n     technical assistance to aid states and other entities in \n     reviewing their laws to ensure that privacy protections and \n     technology issues are covered, such as electronic stalking, \n     and training for law enforcement on high tech electronic \n     crimes against women. It authorizes $5,000,000 per year for \n     2007 through 2011 to be administered by the Department of \n     Justice.\n       Sec. 108. Sex Offender Training. Under this section, the \n     Attorney General will consult with victim advocates and \n     experts in the area of sex offender training. The Attorney \n     General will develop criteria and training programs to assist \n     probation officers, parole officers, and others who work with \n     released sex offenders. This section reauthorizes the program \n     at $3,000,000 annually for 2007 through 2011.\n       Sec. 109. National Stalker Database and Domestic Violence \n     Reduction. Under this section, the Attorney General may issue \n     grants to states and units of local governments to improve \n     data entry into local, state, and national crime information \n     databases for cases of stalking and domestic violence. This \n     section reauthorizes the program at $3,000,000 annually for \n     2007 through 2011.\n       Sec. 110. Federal Victim Assistants. This section \n     authorizes funding for U.S. Attorney offices to hire \n     counselors to assist victims and witnesses in prosecution of \n     domestic violence and sexual assault cases. This section is \n     reauthorized for $1,000,000 annually for 2007 through 2011.\n       Sec. 111. Grants for Law Enforcement Training Programs. \n     This section would authorize a Department of Justice grant \n     program to help train State and local law enforcement to \n     identify and protect trafficking victims, to investigate and \n     prosecute trafficking cases and to develop State and local \n     laws to prohibit acts of trafficking. It proposes $10,000,000 \n     in grants annually from 2006 to 2010.\n       Sec. 112. Reauthorization of the Court-Appointed Special \n     Advocate Program. This section reauthorizes the widely-used \n     Court-Appointed Special Advocate Program (CASA). CASA is a \n     nationwide volunteer program that helps represent children \n     who are in the family and/or juvenile justice system due to \n     neglect or abuse. This provision also allows the program to \n     request the FBI conduct background checks of prospective \n     volunteers. This program is reauthorized at $12,000,000 \n     annually for 2007 through 2011.\n       Sec. 113. Preventing Cyberstalking. To strengthen stalking \n     prosecution tools, this section amends the Communications Act \n     of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 223(h)(1)) to expand the definition of a \n     telecommunications device to include any device or software \n     that uses the Internet and possible Internet technologies \n     such as voice over internet services. This amendment will \n     allow federal prosecutors more discretion in charging \n     stalking cases that occur entirely over the internet.\n       Sec. 114. Updating the Federal Stalking Law. Section 114 \n     improves the existing federal stalking law by borrowing state \n     stalking law language to (1) criminalize stalking \n     surveillance (this would include surveillance by new \n     technology devices such as Global Positioning Systems (GPS)); \n     and (2) to expand the accountable harm to include substantial \n     emotional harm to the victim. The provision also enhances \n     minimum penalties if the stalking occurred in violation of an \n     existing protection order.\n       Sec. 115. Repeat Offender Provision. This section updates \n     the criminal code to permit doubling the applicable penalty \n     for repeat federal domestic violence offender--a sentencing \n     consequence already permissible for repeat federal sexual \n     assault offenders.\n       Sec. 116. Prohibiting Dating Violence. Utilizing the Act's \n     existing definition of dating violence, section 115 amends \n     the federal interstate domestic violence prohibition to \n     include interstate dating violence.\n       Sec. 117. Prohibiting Violence in Special Maritime and \n     Territorial Jurisdiction. This section tightens the \n     interstate domestic violence criminal provision to include \n     special maritime and territories within the scope of federal \n     jurisdiction.\n       Sec. 118. Updating Protection Order Definition in 28 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 534(e)(3)(B).\n       Sec. 119. Grants for Outreach to Underserved Populations. \n     This grant program authorizes $2 million annually for local, \n     national, and regional information campaigns on services and \n     law enforcement resources available to victims of domestic \n     violence, dating violence, sexual assault and stalking.\n\n\n Title II. Improving Services for Victims of Domestic Violence, Dating \n                 Violence, Sexual assault and stalking\n\n       Sec. 201. Findings\n       Sec. 202. Sexual Assault Services Provision. This section \n     creates a separate and direct funding stream dedicated to \n     sexual assault services. Currently, the Act funds rape \n     prevention programs, but does not provide sufficient \n     resources for direct services dedicated solely to sexual \n     assault victims, primarily rape crisis centers. Under this \n     new program funding will be distributed by the Department of \n     Justice to states and their sexual violence coalitions. The \n     formula grant funds will assist States and Tribes in their \n     efforts to provide services to adult, youth and child sexual \n     assault victims and their family and ho1usehold members, \n     including intervention, advocacy, accompaniment in medical, \n     criminal justice, and social support systems, support \n     services, and related assistance. Funding is also provided \n     for training and technical assistance. This section \n     authorizes $50,000,000 annually for 2006-2010.\n       Sec. 203. Amendments to the Rural Domestic Violence and \n     Child Abuse Enforcement Assistance Program. This section \n     reauthorizes and expands the existing education, training and \n     services grant programs that address violence against women \n     in rural areas. This provision renews the rural VAWA program, \n     extends direct grants to state and local governments for \n     services in rural areas and expands purpose areas to include \n     community collaboration projects in rural areas and the \n     creation or expansion of additional victim services. New \n     language expands the program coverage to sexual assault, \n     child sexual assault and stalking. It also expands \n     eligibility from rural states to rural communities, \n     increasing access to rural sections of otherwise highly \n     populated states. This section authorizes $55,000,000 \n     annually for 2007 through 2011 (it is currently authorized at \n     $40 million a year).\n       Sec. 204. Education, Training and Enhanced Services to End \n     Violence Against Women with Disabilities. This section \n     reauthorizes and expands the existing education, training and \n     services grant programs that address violence against women \n     with disabilities. New purpose areas include construction and \n     personnel costs for shelters to better serve victims with \n     disabilities, the development of collaborative partnerships \n     between victim service organizations and organizations \n     serving individuals with disabilities and the development of \n     model programs that situate advocacy and intervention \n     services for victims within organizations serving individuals \n     with disabilities. The program is authorized at $10,000,000 \n     for each fiscal year 2007 through 2011.\n       Sec. 205. Education, Training and Services to End Violence \n     Against and Abuse of Women Later in Life. This section \n     reauthorizes and expands the existing education, training and \n     services grant programs that address violence against elderly \n     women. Grants will be distributed by the Department of \n     Justice to States, local government, nonprofit and \n     nongovernmental organizations for providing training and \n     services for domestic violence, dating violence, sexual \n     assault and stalking victims age 60 and older. The program is \n     authorized at $10,000,000 annually for 2007 through 2011.\n       Sec. 206. Strengthening the National Domestic Violence \n     Hotline. Section 206 eliminates a current funding requirement \n     that any funds appropriated to the Hotline in excess of \n     $3,000,000 be devoted entirely to a non-existent Internet \n     program.\n\n\n   Title III. Services, Protection and Justice for Young Victims of \n                                Violence\n\n       Sec. 301. Findings\n       Sec. 302. Rape Prevention and Education. This section \n     reauthorizes the Rape Prevention and Education Program. It \n     appropriates $80,000,000 annually (its current authorization \n     level) for 2007 through 2011. Of the total funds made \n     available under this subsection in each fiscal year, a \n     minimum of $1,500,000 will be allotted to the National Sexual \n     Violence Resource Center.\n       Sec. 303. Services, Education, Protection and Justice for \n     Young Victims of Violence. This section establishes a new \n     subtitle that would create four new grant programs designed \n     to address dating violence committed by and against youth.\n       (1) The Services to Advocate for and Respond to Teens \n     program authorizes grants to nonprofit, nongovernmental and \n     community based organizations that provide services to teens \n     and young adult victims of domestic violence, dating \n     violence, sexual assault or stalking. This section is \n     authorized for $15,000,000 annually for 2007 through 2011 and \n     will be administered by the Department of Health and Human \n     Services.\n       (2) The Access to Justice for Teens program is a \n     demonstration grant program to promote collaboration between \n     courts (including tribal courts), domestic violence and\n\n[[Page S13764]]\n\n     sexual assault service providers, youth organizations and \n     service providers, violence prevention programs, and law \n     enforcement agencies. The purposes of the collaborative \n     projects are to identify and respond to domestic violence, \n     dating violence, sexual assault and stalking committed by or \n     against teens; to recognize the need to hold the perpetrators \n     accountable; to establish and implement procedures to protect \n     teens; and to increase cooperation among community \n     organizations. This section is authorized at $5,000,000 \n     annually for 2007 through 2011 to be administered by \n     Department of Justice.\n       (3) The third program established under Sec. 303 is the \n     Grants for Training and Collaboration on the Intersection \n     between Domestic Violence and Child Maltreatment program. It \n     provides grants to child welfare agencies, courts, domestic \n     or dating violence service providers, law enforcement and \n     other related community organizations. Grant recipients are \n     to develop collaborative responses, services and cross-\n     training to enhance responses to families where there is both \n     child abuse and neglect and domestic violence or dating \n     violence. This section authorized at $5,000,000 annually 2007 \n     through 2011 to be administered by the Department of Justice.\n       (4) The final program established under 303 is the \n     Supporting Teens through Education and Protection program to \n     be administered by the Department of Justice to eligible \n     middle and high school schools that work with domestic \n     violence and sexual assault experts to train and counsel \n     school faculty and students.\n       Sec. 304. Reauthorization of Grants to Reduce Violence \n     Against Women on Campus. This amends the existing campus \n     program to be administered by the Department of Justice on a \n     three-year grant cycle, provides more money and sets \n     parameters for training of campus law enforcement and campus \n     judicial boards. This section is authorized at $12,000,000 \n     for 2007 and $15,000,000 for 2008 through 2011 (it is \n     currently authorized at $10 million).\n       Sec. 305. Juvenile Justice. The overwhelming majority of \n     girls entering the juvenile justice system are victims of \n     abuse and violence, and the system must provide adequate \n     services that are tailored to girls' gender-specific needs \n     and to their experiences of abuse. These provisions amend the \n     Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act to permit \n     grantees to detail gender-specific services.\n       Sec. 306. Safe Havens for Children. This section continues \n     and expands a pilot Justice Department grant program aimed at \n     reducing domestic violence and child abuse during parental \n     visitation or the transfer of children for visitation by \n     expanding the availability of supervised visitation centers. \n     It reauthorizes the program for $20,000,000 annually for 2007 \n     through 2011.\n\n\n   Title IV. Strengthening America's Families by Preventing Violence\n\n       Sec. 401. Findings, Purpose and Authorization for three \n     new, child-focused programs. This section creates: (1) Grants \n     to Assist Children and Youth Exposed to Violence that \n     authorizes new, collaborative programs, administered by the \n     Office on Violence Against Women in the Department of Justice \n     in collaboration with the Administration for Children, Youth \n     and Families in the Department of Health and Human Services, \n     to provide services for children who have been exposed to \n     domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault or \n     stalking for the purpose of mitigating the effects of such \n     violence. Programs authorized under this section include both \n     direct services for children and their non-abusing parent or \n     caretaker, and training/coordination for programs that serve \n     children and youth (such as Head Start, child care, and \n     after-school programs). It is authorized at $20,000,000 \n     annually from 2007 through 2011.\n       This section also establishes the Development of Curricula \n     and Pilot Programs for Home Visitation Projects. Home \n     visitation services are offered in many states and on some \n     military bases to provide assistance to new parents or \n     families in crisis. Home visitation services, in addition to \n     providing assistance to the parents, look for signs of child \n     abuse or neglect in the home. This provision, administered by \n     the Office on Violence Against Women in the Department of \n     Justice in collaboration with the Administration for \n     Children, Youth and Families in the Department of Health and \n     Human Services, creates model training curricula and provides \n     home visitation services to help families to develop strong \n     parenting skills and ensure the safety of all family members. \n     The program is authorized at $7,000 per year for 2006-2010.\n       The final new program engages men and youth in preventing \n     domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault and \n     stalking. It authorizes the development, testing and \n     implementation of programs to help youth and children develop \n     respectful, non-violent relationships. The grant is \n     administered by the Office on Violence Against Women at the \n     Department of Justice in collaboration with the Department of \n     Health and Human Services, and eligible entities include \n     community-based youth service organizations and state and \n     local governmental entities. It is authorized at $10,000,000 \n     annually for 2007 through 2011.\n       Sec. 402. Study Conducted by the Centers for Disease \n     Control and Prevention. This provision authorizes $2 million \n     to the Centers for Disease Control to study the best \n     practices for reducing and preventing violence against women \n     and children and an evaluation of programs funded under this \n     Title.\n\n\n Title V. Strengthening the Health Care System's Response To Domestic \n         Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault and Stalking\n\n       Sec. 501. Findings.\n       Sec. 502. Purposes.\n       Sec. 503. Training and Education of Health Professionals. \n     This section provides new grants to train health care \n     providers and students in health professional schools on \n     recognizing and appropriately responding to domestic and \n     sexual violence. The provision authorizes $3,000,000 each \n     year from 2007 through 2011 to be administered by the \n     Department of Health and Human Services.\n       Sec. 504. Grants to Foster Public Health Responses to \n     Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault and \n     Stalking. Section 504 provides grants for statewide and local \n     collaborations between domestic and sexual violence services \n     providers and health care providers including state hospitals \n     and public health departments. These programs would provide \n     training and education to health care providers and would \n     develop policies and procedures that enhance screening of \n     women for exposure to domestic and sexual violence, and \n     encourage proper identification, documentation and referral \n     for services when appropriate. This section is authorized at \n     $5,000,000 annually from 2007 through 2011.\n       Sec. 506. Research on Effective Interventions in the Health \n     Care Setting to Address Domestic Violence. Includes funding \n     for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and \n     Administration for Healthcare Research and Quality to \n     evaluate effective interventions within the health care \n     setting to improve abused women's health and safety and \n     prevent further victimization. This section is authorized at \n     $5,000,000 annually from 2007 through 2011.\n\n\n   Title VI. Housing Opportunities and Safety for Battered Women and \n                                Children\n\n       Sec. 601. Amends the Violence Against Women Act to include \n     a title addressing housing needs of victims of domestic \n     violence, dating violence, sexual assault and stalking.\n       Sec. 41401. Findings.\n       Sec. 41402. Purposes.\n       Sec. 41403. Definitions.\n       Sec. 41404. Collaborative Grants to Develop Long-Term \n     Housing for Victims. Modeled after successful affordable \n     housing, community development, and ``housing first'' \n     programs across the nation, this section would provide \n     $10,000,000 for the Department of Health and Human Services \n     in partnership with the Department of Housing and Urban \n     Development to fund collaborative efforts to: place domestic \n     violence survivors into long-term housing as soon as \n     reasonable and safe; provide services to help individuals or \n     families find long-term housing; provide financial assistance \n     to attain long-term housing (including funds for security \n     deposits, first month's rent, utilities, down payments, \n     short-term rental assistance); provide services to help \n     individuals or families remain housed (including advocacy, \n     transportation, child care, financial assistance, counseling, \n     case management, and other supportive services); and \n     create partnerships to purchase, build, renovate, repair, \n     convert and operate affordable housing units. Funds may \n     not be directly spent on construction, modernization, or \n     renovations.\n       Sec. 41405. Grants to Combat Violence Against Women in \n     Public and Assisted Housing. This section establishes grants \n     to assist public and Indian housing authorities, landlords, \n     property management companies and other housing providers and \n     agencies in responding appropriately to domestic and sexual \n     violence. Grants would provide education and training, \n     development of policies and practices, enhancement of \n     collaboration with victim organizations, protection of \n     victims residing in public, Indian and assisted housing, and \n     reduction of evictions and denial of housing to victims for \n     crimes and lease violations committed or directly caused by \n     the perpetrators of violence against them. The program is \n     authorized at $10,000,000 and will be administered by the \n     Office on Violence Against Women in the Department of \n     Justice.\n       Sec. 602. Transitional Housing Assistance Grants for \n     Victims of Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault \n     or Stalking. Section 602 amends the existing transitional \n     housing program created by the PROTECT Act and administered \n     by the Office on Violence Against Women in the Department of \n     Justice. This section expands the current direct-assistance \n     grants to include funds for operational, capital and \n     renovation costs. Other changes include providing services to \n     victims of dating violence, sexual assault and stalking; \n     extending the length of time for receipt of benefits to match \n     that used by HUD transitional housing programs; and updating \n     the existing program to reflect the concerns of victim \n     service providers. The provision would increase the \n     authorized funding for the grant from $30,000,000 to \n     $40,000,000.\n       Sec. 603. Public and Indian Housing Authority Plans \n     Reporting Requirement.\n       Sec. 604. Housing Strategies.\n       Sections 603 and 604 amend the Housing and Urban \n     Development (UUD) Agency reporting requirements imposed on \n     public housing applicants. Pursuant to the amendment, HUD \n     applicants must include any\n\n[[Page S13765]]\n\n     plans to address domestic violence, dating violence, sexual \n     assault and stalking in their application.\n       Sec. 605. Amendment to the McKinney-Vento Homeless \n     Assistance Act. This provision amends the Homeless Management \n     Information Systems (HMIS) statute in the McKinney-Vento \n     Homelessness Assistance Act to protect the confidentiality of \n     victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault \n     and stalking receiving assistance from HUD-funded victim \n     service programs. It requires that these programs refrain \n     from disclosing personally identifying information to the \n     HMIS. HUD-funded victim service providers may disclose non-\n     personally identifying information to the HMIS.\n       Sec. 606. Amendments to the Low Income Housing Assistance \n     Voucher Program.\n       Sec. 607. Amendments to the Public Housing Program. \n     Sections 606 and 607 amend the Low Income Housing Assistance \n     Voucher program (also known as the Section 8 or Housing \n     Choice Voucher program) and the Public Housing program to \n     state that an individual's status as a victim of domestic \n     violence, dating violence, or stalking is not an appropriate \n     basis for denial of program assistance by a public housing \n     authority. It also states that incidents of domestic \n     violence, dating violence and stalking shall not be good \n     cause for terminating a lease held by the victim. The \n     amendments specify that the authority of an owner or PHA to \n     evict or terminate perpetrators of abuse shall not be \n     limited and gives landlords and PHAs the ability to \n     bifurcate a lease to maintain the victim's tenancy while \n     evicting the perpetrator. Victims must certify their \n     status as victims by presenting appropriate documentation \n     to the PHA or owner, and the language clarifies that \n     victims can be evicted for lease violations or if their \n     tenancy poses a threat to the community.\n\n\n     Title VII. Providing Economic Security for Victims of Violence\n\n       Sec. 701. Resource Center on Domestic and Sexual Violence \n     in the Workplace. This provision authorizes the Attorney \n     General to award a grant to a private non-profit entity or \n     tribal organization for the establishment and operation of a \n     national resource center to provide information and \n     assistance to employers and labor organizations to aid \n     victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual \n     assault, and stalking. A million dollars would be \n     appropriated annually for fiscal years 2007 through 2011 to \n     support these activities.\n\n\n   Title VIII. Protection of Battered and Trafficked Immigrant Women\n\n       Sec. 801. Treatment of Spouse and Children of Victims. For \n     some trafficking victims, providing assistance in the \n     investigation or prosecution of the trafficking case can \n     endanger or traumatize the victim or her family members. The \n     ability to ensure safety of family members living abroad is \n     crucial to trafficking victims' or crime victims' well being \n     and ability to effectively assist in prosecutions. This \n     section allows T and U visa holders' spouse, children, \n     parents, and unmarried siblings under 18 to join them in the \n     United States.\n       Sec. 802. Permitted Presence of Victims of Severe \n     Trafficking. This section permits trafficking victims' \n     unlawful presence in the United States only if the \n     trafficking is at least one central reason for the unlawful \n     presence. The limited exception to the unlawful presence \n     provision is identical to that afforded to non-citizen \n     survivors of domestic abuse.\n       Sec. 803. Adjustment of Status for Victims of Trafficking. \n     This section shortens the adjustment time and allows \n     trafficking victims to apply for lawful permanent residency 2 \n     years after receiving a T visa.\n       Sec. 804. Protection and Assistance for Victims of \n     Trafficking. This section clarifies the roles and \n     responsibilities accorded to the Department of Justice and \n     the Department of Homeland Security in addressing trafficking \n     and supporting victims. Furthermore, this section clarifies \n     that ``assistance'' by trafficking victims includes \n     responding to and cooperating with requests for evidence and \n     information.\n       Sec. 805. Protecting Victims of Child Abuse and Incest. \n     This section clarifies language to ensure that children of \n     VAWA self-petitioners abused by lawful permanent residents \n     receive the VAWA immigration protection and lawful permanent \n     residency along with their abused parent. It also assures \n     that children eligible for VAWA immigration relief are not \n     excluded from Child Status Protection Act protection. This \n     section enhances protection for incest victims by permitting \n     VAWA self-petitions to be filed until age 25 by individuals \n     who qualified for VAWA relief before they were 21 but did not \n     file a petition before that time if the abuse is at least one \n     central reason for the delayed filing.\n       Under current law, adopted foreign-born children must \n     reside with their adoptive parents for two years to gain \n     legal immigration status through their adoptive parents. \n     This section allows adopted children who were battered or \n     subjected to extreme cruelty by their adoptive parent or \n     the adoptive parent's family member residing in the \n     household to attain legal immigration status without \n     having to reside for two years with the abusive adoptive \n     family member.\n       Sec. 811. Definition of VAWA Self-Petitioner. This section \n     creates a term ``VAWA self-petitioner'' which covers all \n     forms of VAWA self-petitions created in VAWA 2000 including \n     VAWA Cuban Adjustment, VAWA HRIFA and VAWA NACARA applicants.\n       Sec. 812. Application in Cases of Voluntary Departure. \n     Under current law, people who fail to comply with voluntary \n     departure orders are barred for 10 years from receiving \n     lawful permanent residency through adjustment of status, \n     cancellation of removal (including VAWA cancellation), change \n     of status, and registry. Denying lawful permanent residency \n     to immigrant victims of domestic violence, sexual assault and \n     trafficking undermines Congressional intent to provide \n     immigration relief crucial to supporting crime victims \n     cooperating with law enforcement and offering protection for \n     battered immigrant spouses and children. This section exempts \n     victims eligible for VAWA, T or U relief from the harsh \n     consequences of failing to comply with voluntary departure \n     orders as long as the extreme cruelty or battery is at least \n     one of the central reasons for the overstay.\n       Sec. 813. Removal Proceedings. This section adds domestic \n     abuse to the list of exceptional circumstances that allow \n     immigrants to file motions to reopen in removal proceedings. \n     VAWA 2000 allowed immigration judges in cancellation of \n     removal and adjustment of status proceedings to waive \n     ineligibility grounds for some VAWA eligible battered \n     petitioners, who acted in self defense, violated their own \n     protection order, or were involved in a crime that didn't \n     result in serious bodily injury or where there was a \n     connection between the crime and their own abuse. This \n     section corrects drafting errors that have made these waivers \n     procedurally unavailable to battered immigrant victims.\n       Sec. 814. Eliminating Abusers' Control Over Applications \n     and Limitation on Petitioning for Abusers. The Violence \n     Against Women Act enabled battered Haitian Refugee \n     Immigration Fairness Act and Cuban Adjustment Act applicants \n     to apply for VAWA immigration relief. In order for these \n     applicants to access the relief, they need to file motions to \n     reopen. However, due to a drafting oversight, the deadline \n     for filing motions to reopen had already passed when VAWA \n     2000 became law. This amendment corrects the drafting and \n     allows these battered immigrants to file motions to reopen \n     and thereby access the relief that was created for them in \n     VAWA 2000.\n       This section also makes approved VAWA self-petitioners and \n     their spouses eligible for employment authorization. \n     Providing employment authorization earlier in the application \n     process gives battered immigrant self-petitioners the means \n     to sever economic dependence on their abusers, promoting \n     their safety and the safety of their children.\n       Section 814 also prohibits a VAWA self-petitioner or a T or \n     U-visa holder from petition for immigrant status for their \n     abuser.\n       Sec. 815. Application for VAWA-Related Relief. This \n     amendment clarifies that certain battered spouses and \n     children can access relief under the Nicaraguan Adjustment \n     and Central American Relief Act that was specifically created \n     for those groups in VAWA 2000. This amendment ensures relief \n     even in cases where an abusive spouse or parent failed to \n     apply to adjust the survivor's status to lawful permanent \n     residency by the statutory deadline or failed to follow \n     through with applications after filing. Thus, this \n     amendment prevents abusers from controlling their non-\n     citizen victims by blocking their ability to successfully \n     access the relief that was intended under VAWA 2000.\n       Sec. 816. Self Petitioning Parents. This section expands \n     the scope of VAWA immigration relief to include \n     intergenerational abuse, allowing non-citizen parents who are \n     abused by their adult U.S. citizen son or daughter to seek \n     VAWA relief\n       Sec. 817. Enhanced VAWA Confidentiality Non-disclosure \n     Protections. This section amends VAWA's confidentiality \n     protections so that they cover a range of immigrant victims \n     eligible for the various forms of VAWA or crime victim \n     related immigration relief including T visa victims, VAWA \n     Cubans, VAWA HRIFAs, VAWA NACARAs and VAWA suspension \n     applicants. This section also ensures that VAWA \n     confidentiality rules apply to each relevant federal agency \n     including the Department of Homeland Security and the \n     Department of State.\n       Sec. 821. Duration of T and U visas. This provision would \n     authorize issuance of T and U visas for a period of not more \n     than 4 years.\n       Sec. 822. Technical Correction to References in Application \n     of Special Physical Presence and Good Moral Character Rules. \n     This section corrects two technical drafting errors. First it \n     ensures that the provisions on physical presence and on good \n     moral character apply to all VAWA cancellation applicants. \n     Second it corrects an incorrectly cited section so that the \n     ``good moral character'' bar applies to bigamy, not unlawful \n     presence.\n       Sec. 823. Petitioning Rights of Certain Former Spouses \n     Under Cuban Adjustment. This section would ensure that \n     battered immigrants are still able to adjust under VAWA Cuban \n     adjustment relief even if they are divorced from the abuser. \n     This provision is necessary to prevent abusers from cutting \n     their spouses off from potential immigration status \n     adjustment by divorcing them.\n       Sec. 824. Self-Petitioning Rights of HRIFA Applicants. This \n     amendment clarifies that Haitian abused applicants can access \n     relief that was specifically created for them in VAWA 2000. \n     Abusers could control battered immigrants by not adjusting \n     their own status to lawful permanent residency pursuant to \n     the Haitian Refugee Immigration Fairness Act (``HRIFA''). The \n     abuser may not follow\n\n[[Page S13766]]\n\n     through with the lawful permanent residency application or \n     fail to file an application at all. This technical correction \n     remedies the problem to ensure that all abused spouses and \n     children otherwise eligible for VAWA HRIFA are able to access \n     this relief.\n       Sec. 825. Motion to Reopen. This section, a correction to \n     VAWA 2000, gives domestic abuse victims the opportunity to \n     file one motion to reopen to pursue VAWA relief, and exempts \n     them from the special motion to reopen filing deadlines.\n       Sec. 826. Protecting Abused Juveniles. This section assures \n     that immigration authorities are not required to contact \n     abusive parents or family members in connection with the \n     abused, neglected, or abandoned juvenile's application for \n     special immigrant juvenile status. This prevents abusive \n     parents from keeping their children from accessing help \n     and support in the United States.\n       Sec. 827. Exceptions for the Protection of Domestic \n     Violence and Crime Victims. This section carves out an \n     exception to the current requirements regarding driver's \n     license or identification cards for victims of domestic \n     violence to ensure their safety.\n       Sec. 831. Short Title for the International Marriage Broker \n     Regulation Act of 2005.\n       Sec. 832. International Marriage Broker Information \n     Requirements. This section provides that a U.S. citizen \n     filing a petition for a K visa for a fiancee from another \n     country must provide information on criminal convictions for \n     specified crimes. These include a list of violent crimes, \n     including assault and battery as well as crimes relating to \n     substance or alcohol abuse. The Department of Homeland \n     Security will provide this criminal history information, \n     along with results of their search for any criminal \n     convictions to the foreign national beneficiary. The \n     Department of State is prohibited from approving a fiancee \n     visa if the petitioner has petitioned for more than 2 K visas \n     in the past, or less than 2 years have passed since the \n     petitioner filed for a K visa and that visa was approved. DHS \n     can waive this bar, but if person has history of violent \n     crimes, the bar cannot be waived unless DHS determined that \n     there are extraordinary circumstances, or the individual's \n     crimes were a result of domestic violence, the individual was \n     not the primary perpetrator of the violence, and the crime \n     did not result in serious bodily injury. DHS is directed to \n     create a database to track repeated K applications and notify \n     petitioner and spouse when second K is applied for in 10-year \n     period. All future K applications will trigger similar \n     notice, with domestic violence pamphlet being sent to K \n     beneficiary. The fact that an individual was provided with \n     this information and the domestic violence pamphlet for \n     immigrants cannot be used to deny their eligibility for \n     relief under VAWA.\n       Sec. 833. Domestic Violence Information and Resources for \n     Immigrants and Regulation of International Marriage Brokers. \n     This section directs DOS, DHS and DOJ to create a pamphlet on \n     domestic violence rights and resources for immigrants as well \n     as a summary of that pamphlet for use by Federal officials in \n     the interview process. The pamphlet is to be translated into \n     at least 14 languages and the required list of translations \n     is to review and revised every 2 years based on the language \n     spoken by the greatest concentration of K nonimmigrant visa \n     applicants. The pamphlet is to be mailed to all K applicants \n     with their visa application process instruction packet as \n     well as a copy of the petition submitted by the petitioner. \n     The pamphlet is to be made available to the public at all \n     consular posts, and posted on the DOS, DHS, and consular post \n     websites. The pamphlet will also be provided to any \n     international marriage broker, government agency or non-\n     governmental advocacy organization.\n       Sec. 834. Sharing of Certain Information. This section \n     provides that there is no bar to the sharing of information \n     between the relevant departments for the purpose of \n     fulfilling the disclosure requirements of the U.S. petition.\n\n\n                   Title IX. Safety for Indian Women\n\n       Sec. 901 and 902. Findings and Purposes.\n       Sec. 903. Consultation Requirement. This section requires \n     the Secretary of the Interior and the Attorney General to \n     consult with and seek recommendations from tribal governments \n     concerning the administration of tribal VAWA funds and \n     programs.\n       Sec. 904. Analysis and Research of Violence Against Indian \n     Women. This provision requests that the National Institute of \n     Justice conduct a national baseline study to examine violence \n     against Indian women and the effectiveness of Federal, State, \n     local and tribal responses. It also requires the Attorney \n     General to establish a task force to assist in the \n     development and implementation of the study and report to \n     Congress. Members of the study shall include tribal \n     governments and national tribal organizations. The violence \n     study is authorized at $1,000,000 for fiscal years 2007 and \n     2008. In addition, this section requires the Secretary of \n     Health and Human Services to conduct a study of injuries to \n     Indian women from incidents of domestic violence, dating \n     violence, sexual assault and stalking and the costs \n     associated with these injuries. The injury report shall be \n     reported to Congress and is authorized at $500,000 for fiscal \n     years 2007 and 2008.\n       Sec. 905. Tracking of Violence Against Indian Women. In \n     cases of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault \n     and stalking, the provision authorizes tribal law enforcement \n     to access and enter information on to Federal criminal \n     information databases (set out in 28 U.S.C. Sec. 534). \n     Second, it permits tribes to develop and maintain national \n     tribal sex offender registries and tribal protection order \n     registries. To undertake the latter, the provision authorizes \n     $1,000,000 for fiscal years 2007 through 2011.\n       Sec. 906. Safety for Indian Women Formula Grants. To better \n     administer grants to Indian Country and enhance the responses \n     of Indian tribal governments, this measure authorizes the \n     Office on Violence Against Women to combine all Native \n     American set asides appropriated under this Act and create a \n     single grant source.\n       Sec. 907. Deputy Director in the Office on Violence Against \n     Women. To coordinate and guide Federal, State, local and \n     tribal responses to violence against Indian women, this \n     provision establishes a Deputy Director of Tribal Affairs in \n     the Office on Violence Against Women. The Deputy Director is \n     charged with several duties, including, but not limited to, \n     oversight of tribal grant programs and developing federal \n     policies and protocols on matters relating to violence \n     against Indian women. In addition, the Deputy Director is \n     authorized to ensure that some portion of tribal funds \n     distributed through VAWA programs will be devoted to \n     enhancing tribal resources such as legal services or shelters \n     for Indian women victimized by domestic violence or sexual \n     assault.\n       Sec. 908 and 909. Enhanced Criminal Law Resources and \n     Domestic Assault by Habitual Offender. Sections 908 and 909 \n     make several changes to existing criminal law. Under current \n     law persons who have been convicted of a qualifying \n     misdemeanor crime of domestic violence under federal or state \n     law are prohibited from possessing firearms. This amendment \n     would expand that prohibition to those persons convicted of a \n     qualifying misdemeanor crime of domestic violence under \n     tribal law.\n       Under current law, federal courts have exclusive \n     jurisdiction over domestic violence crimes committed in \n     Indian country where the perpetrator is a non-Indian and the \n     victim is an Indian, and concurrent jurisdiction with the \n     tribal courts where the perpetrator is an Indian and the \n     victim is a non-Indian. Under this scheme, federal officers \n     can only arrest for misdemeanors that occur in the presence \n     of the arresting officer. Most domestic violence offenses are \n     misdemeanors not committed in the presence of a federal \n     officer. Accordingly, this amendment will eliminate that \n     requirement and allow a federal arrest if there is reasonable \n     grounds that the offense was committed. Finally, the \n     provision creates a repeat offender provision.\n\n\n                      Title X. DNA Fingerprinting\n\n       Sec. 1001. Short Title.\n       Sec. 1002. Use of Opt-Out Procedure to Remove Samples from \n     National DNA Index. Because this title expands the scope of \n     the national DNA database to include DNA samples from \n     arrestees, this particular section amends the current \n     expungement protocols and directs the FBI to remove samples \n     in the event of an overturned conviction, acquittal, or the \n     charge was dismissed.\n       Sec. 1003. Expanded Use of COIS Grants. To reduce the \n     extraordinary backlog of rape kits and other crime scene \n     evidence waiting for DNA testing, the federal government \n     makes available to States a targeted DNA grant program. \n     Specifically, States may seek funding to reduce the backlog \n     in crime scene evidence, to reduce the backlog in DNA samples \n     of offenders convicted of qualifying state offenses, or to \n     enhance the State's DNA laboratory capabilities. This section \n     would expand the grant purpose regarding offender DNA samples \n     to include all samples collected under applicable state law; \n     accordingly, States could use federal funding to test samples \n     collected from arrestees or voluntary elimination samples.\n       Sec. 1004. Authorization to Conduct DNA Sample Collection \n     From Persons Arrested or Detained Under Federal Authority. \n     Current law allows federal authorities to collect DNA samples \n     from individuals upon indictment. This provision would expand \n     that authority to permit the Attorney General to collect DNA \n     at arrest or detention of non-United States persons.\n       Sec. 1005. Tolling of Statute of Limitations for Sexual \n     Abuse Offenses. This amendment strikes a carve-out \n     authorizing John Doe indictments in sexual assault crimes and \n     makes uniform the federal law that tolls the statute of \n     limitations for all federal crimes where DNA evidence is \n     collected (Sec. 3297).\n\n  The bill (H.R. 3402), as amended, was read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/16/senate-section/article/S13766-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13766-S13767]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--S. RES. 336\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I am going to propound what I hope will \nbe two unanimous consent requests about one particular issue. The issue \nis on the anti-Semitic statements made by the President of Iran, Mr. \nAhmadinejad, who said, among other things, that the state of Israel \nshould be wiped off the face of the Earth. We have been working \ncooperatively to try to get this resolution cleared, condemning those \nstatements. We had some concerns raised with the resolution which I \nwill discuss in more detail. We finally have a version cleared, and I \nwill discuss in detail how we had to work through that. Suffice it to \nsay\n\n[[Page S13767]]\n\nthat it is good to see that we are going to finally get strong \nbipartisan support to condemn this conduct and call for Iran to be a \nconstructive partner in the peace process in the Middle East.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of S. Res. 336, a resolution to condemn the recent \ndestructive and anti-Semitic statements of the President of Iran which \nI submitted earlier today. I ask that the resolution be agreed to, the \npreamble be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, while I personally am vehemently opposed to \nthe statements that have been made by the President of Iran, I have \nbeen asked by the Members on this side of the aisle to object, and I do \nso object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/16/senate-section/article/S13767-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13767-S13768]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      CONDEMNING ANTI-SEMITIC STATEMENTS OF THE PRESIDENT OF IRAN\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 337, a revised \nversion of the same resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 337) to condemn the harmful, \n     destructive, and anti-Semitic statements of Mahmoud \n     Ahmadinejad, the President of Iran, and to demand an apology \n     for those statements of hate and animosity toward all Jewish \n     people of the world.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed \nto, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 337) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 337\n\n       Whereas Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the President of Iran, \n     declared in an October 26, 2005, address at the World Without \n     Zionism conference in Tehran that ``the new wave that has \n     started in Palestine, and we witness it in the Islamic World \n     too, will eliminate this disgraceful stain from the Islamic \n     World'' and that Israel ``must be wiped off the map.'';\n       Whereas the President of Iran told reporters on December \n     8th at an Islamic conference in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, ``Some \n     European countries insist on saying that Hitler killed \n     millions of innocent Jews in furnaces. . .although we don't \n     accept this claim.'';\n       Whereas Mr. Ahmadinejad then stated, ``If the Europeans are \n     honest they should give some of their provinces in Europe . . \n     . to the Zionists, and the Zionists can establish their state \n     in Europe.'';\n       Whereas on December 14, 2005, Mr. Ahmadinejad said live on \n     Iranian television, ``they have invented a myth that Jews \n     were massacred and place this above God, religions and the \n     prophets.'';\n       Whereas the leaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran, \n     beginning with its founder, the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, \n     have issued statements of hate against the United States, \n     Israel, and Jewish peoples;\n       Whereas certain leaders, including Ahmadi Nezhad, and the \n     Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, have similarly called for the \n     destruction of the United States, and the Islamic Republic of \n     Iran has funded, armed, trained, assisted, and sheltered \n     leading terrorists, including terrorists in Iraq who use \n     Iranian support to kill military personnel of the United \n     States;\n       Whereas an estimated 6,000,000 Jews were killed in the Nazi \n     Holocaust;\n       Whereas the remarks of President Ahmadinejad have been \n     denounced around the world and condemned by among others, the \n     political leaders of the United States, Arab nations, Israel, \n     Europe, and the United Nations;\n       Whereas it is a crime in the Federal Republic of Germany to \n     deny the existence of the Holocaust; and\n       Whereas the United Nations, in General Assembly Resolution \n     181 (1947), recommended the adoption of the Plan of Partition \n     with Economic Union for Palestine, which called for an \n     independent Jewish State: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) condemns the recent statement by President Ahmadinejad \n     that denied the occurrence of the Holocaust and supported \n     moving the State of Israel to Europe;\n       (2) demands an official apology for these damaging, anti-\n     Semitic statements that ignore history, human suffering, and \n     the loss of life during the Holocaust;\n       (3) and\n       (6) reaffirms the need for Iran to--\n       (A) end its support for international terrorism; and\n       (B) join other Middle Eastern countries in seeking a \n     successful outcome of the Middle East peace process.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oregon. I know \nhe personally believes in the original resolution. Before I get into \nthe disparities between the two resolutions and some of the difficulty \nwe have had over the last several days in trying to pass this \nresolution, it is important to understand how reprehensible these \nstatements are and how dangerous they are in light of not only the \nconflicts within the Middle East but the frightening perspective of \nIran having nuclear capabilities.\n  We hear mixed reports. We have heard reports from the overseas press \nin the last few weeks about fears that Iran is actually within months, \npotentially, of having nuclear weapons capability. The idea that a \ncountry with a President who says that Israel should be wiped off the \nmap and then amends the statement, if you can call it that, to say, \nWell, maybe they could move it to Europe, Germany or Austria, as \nCharles Krauthammer recently noted:\n\n       . . . perhaps near the site of an old concentration camp.\n\n  This is the kind of ridiculous statement one would expect out of a \nstreet merchant who is out there spewing anti-Semitic statements but \nnot from the President of a country. It is unbelievable. As \nunbelievable as that statement is, it is almost equally unbelievable, \nthe silence of response from the civilized world in condemning this \nstatement and calling for actions on the part of the United Nations to \ncondemn Iran, sanction Iran, and a whole host of other remedies \navailable.\n  This condemnation we passed is a mild condemnation. We tried to make \nit a little stronger. We didn't achieve that. But what we need to \nrecognize is that Iran, as the President has said, is a real threat. It \nis a real threat because there are people in that country, not the \naverage Iranian but people at the leadership levels of that government \nwho have explicit designs to not only disrupt the process of democracy \nbuilding in the Middle East but also disrupt any attempt for peace and \nfinally eliminate millions of Israelis from the face of the Earth.\n  That is something that the civilized world should not stand for. The \nUnited Nations should not stand for it, should not countenance the \ncontinuation of Iran sitting where they sit without having to undergo \nsome sort of sanction or reprimand.\n  It is important to understand how destabilizing Iran is in our fight \nto create stable democracies in the Middle East, how they foment anti-\nSemitic, anti-Zionist, as well as anti-democratic sentiment in the \nMiddle East, and how they sponsor terrorism.\n  One of the pieces of legislation I am most proud of in my time in the \nSenate was the Syrian Accountability Act. Throughout the years, Iranian \ninfluence in Lebanon and Syria has oppressed fellow Arabs. Well, \nIranians are not Arabs but oppress fellow Muslims and obviously some \nChristians. But it is important for us, as a Senate, as a people, to \nunderstand the threat that Iran poses to everything we believe in and \nthe larger picture of what we are trying to accomplish in Iraq and the \nMiddle East.\n  We are trying to do something that for a long time people in this \ncountry and even some today believe is not possible. Some have \nsuggested we can't win the mission we have engaged in. The mission we \nhave engaged in is to create a stable democracy in the Middle East, in \nthe Arab world. The mission we have engaged in, more fundamentally, is \nto provide increased national security to this country. That is the \nfirst mission.\n  The strategy is to ensure security for this country. The tactic is to \nestablish democracies in an area of the world that threatened this \ncountry. Iran stands starkly opposed to that objective and, further, \nwith statements such as this, destabilizes the entire region and \nfoments and uses sort of the lowest base, primitive instincts of the \nhaters in the Middle East to undermine our objective.\n  We are succeeding in Iraq in spite of the Iranians. We are succeeding \nin Afghanistan in spite of the Iranians. We\n\n[[Page S13768]]\n\nare moving democracy forward. But we dare not take our eye off what \nIran is doing and is preparing. They are actively pursuing a nuclear \nweapons program under the nose of the rest of the world, with virtually \nno real attempt to limit that development.\n  When you see these statements combined with that, it is a flare that \nshould be going up across the world of what we may be confronted with \nin the next months or years, with a nuclear bomb. This resolution is a \nstatement that needed to be made. I am glad we passed this resolution. \nBut we need to do more. I have authored a piece of legislation on Iran, \nwhich calls for the funding of pro-democracy groups within Iran. Others \nhave offered ideas to provide increased sanctions on Iran.\n  If you look at people who study the country of Iran and tell you--we \nhad a very good hearing that Senator Coburn chaired a few weeks ago. \nWhen you listened to the testimony at that hearing, which I had the \nopportunity to do for a little while, you hear that the Iranian street \nis one that is largely sympathetic to the United States and to the \ncause of freedom and democracy. They are oppressed people. Oppressed \npeople generally do want and seek freedom. So we have, I believe, an \nopportunity, as we have had opportunities in the past, when we lent our \nideas and our encouragement to help develop either exile movements or \nfreedom movements within the countries that are a threat to the region \nand a threat to our country.\n  It is important for the Senate to speak out and say we stand with \nyou--those of you who seek freedom, those of you who seek democracy, \nthose of you who do not want to be threatening to your neighbors, or \nsay, as the President of Iran has said, he wants to wipe Israel off the \nmap. We have an obligation in the Senate, and I will be pressing very \nhard next year to pass my legislation on Iran.\n  I remember several years ago when Senator Boxer and I introduced \nlegislation on Syria, and we did not get a lot of support in the \ncommittee and had trouble on the floor of the Senate. We had trouble at \nthe White House. They were opposed to the bill. Eventually, the \nadministration, the committee, and the Senate came along and we were \nable to pass the Syria Accountability Act. Literally, within a few \nmonths, we saw dramatic changes in Lebanon.\n  The Syria Accountability Act was a measure that called for Syria to \nget out of Lebanon and imposed sanctions on Syria for not doing so. The \nPresident, to my dismay, in some respects, didn't support it at first. \nPresidents don't often like Congress telling them what to do when it \ncomes to foreign policy. But this President not only signed the Syria \nAccountability Act, he implemented the sanctions--a tough regime of \nsanctions--and it had a tremendous effect. I have had people come over \nfrom Lebanon and tell me of the importance of that particular \nlegislation and the symbolism of America standing with the people of \nLebanon against the evil dictator in Syria.\n  The symbolism of us passing this resolution today, and the more than \nthe symbolism of passing the Iran Freedom and Support Act, is an \nimportant sign in a time now with these kinds of comments that Iran has \npopped its head up again--its rather unattractive head--in the area of \ninfluencing policy in the Middle East. We tried in this resolution to \nmatch the language of the Iranian bill I have introduced with the \nlanguage, as I said, with this resolution, but unfortunately, we were \nnot able to clear that language. I want to read the changes we had to \nmake in the resolved section of the resolution that were struck as \nunacceptable for us to be able to pass it by unanimous consent. The \nportions we had to drop were two resolved sections. The three things \nthat are in the final version that passed say:\n\n       Resolved, That the Senate\n       (1) condemns the recent statement by President Ahmadinejad \n     that denied the occurrence of the Holocaust and supported \n     moving the State of Israel to Europe;\n       (2) demands an official apology for these damaging, anti-\n     Semitic statements that ignore history, human suffering, and \n     the loss of life during the Holocaust;\n       (6) reaffirms the need for Iran to\n       (A) end its support for international terrorism;\n       (B) join other Middle Eastern countries in seeking a \n     successful outcome of the Middle East peace process.\n\n  What was struck were two sentences:\n\n       The Senate supports efforts by the people of Iran to \n     exercise self-determination over the form of government of \n     their country.\n\n  That was not acceptable to some here in the Senate. And second is:\n\n       The Senate supports a national referendum in Iran, with \n     oversight by international observers and monitors, to certify \n     the integrity and fairness of the referendum.\n\n  So we could not adopt tonight in the Senate the Senate saying to the \npeople of Iran that we support efforts of self-determination and a \nnational referendum that was free and fair. That is, in my mind, a \nrather unfortunate occurrence. But I found, from my perspective, that \nit was so important to condemn these actions that we agreed to strike \nthose two sentences from the resolved clauses. I don't necessarily \nunderstand why anyone would oppose either of those sentences, those \nresolved clauses. They state that we are for freedom and democracy for \nall people, including the people of Iran. Maybe it is because we are \npursuing that and it becomes such an issue of partisan controversy in \nthe country of Iraq--or saying we support that same thing in Iran would \nsomehow taint their criticism of the current mission in Iraq. I don't \nknow. I am still groping for answers as to why those two clauses were \nnot acceptable.\n  What was not acceptable were the comments and the actions of \ndeveloping nuclear weapons by the terrorist regime in Iran.\n  I appreciate my colleagues for agreeing to pass this resolution. I \nthank all of the cosponsors. There were some 20 cosponsors of this \nresolution. The first Democrat was Senator Mikulski. I also thank my \ncolleague in the chair for his patience and allowing me the opportunity \nto speak here tonight. He is also a cosponsor of the resolution. No one \nis a stronger advocate for peace and the mission we are trying to \naccomplish in the Middle East, and as well for the protection of the \nstate of Israel, than the occupant of the chair. It is a pleasure to \nhave the Senator from Minnesota in the chair while I am delivering \nthese remarks. The Senator from Minnesota is truly one of the great \nleaders on the Foreign Relations Committee in this regard. I commend \nhim for his efforts. I know he will be working with me on the Iran \nbill, on which he is a cosponsor, in trying to send a statement from \nthe Senate that Iran is a threat--a real threat--and we need to do \nsomething other than simply stand back and jawbone international \norganizations--feckless international organizations-- in some respects, \nas the Senator from Minnesota knows, corrupt international \norganizations--to do something that they have shown no desire, \nwillingness, or ability to accomplish, and that is to spread democracy, \nto lift people out of bondage into freedom.\n\n  We in the United States have to begin to take steps. The steps we are \ntalking about in this resolution and the bill we hope to pass next year \nare not military steps. That is the last resort. But we need to start \nacting. Sitting silently by, doing nothing as a crazy man as president \nof a country, potentially developing nuclear weapons in the most \nsensitive area of the world is not acceptable for the Senate and is not \nacceptable for this country.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this morning the Senate voted to continue \ndebating on the conference report on the PATRIOT Act. Clearly, Senators \nbelieve we can do better in protecting the privacy of innocent \nAmericans while we fight terrorism. No one seriously believes that the \nexpiring provisions of the PATRIOT Act should be allowed to lapse while \nthis debate continues.\n  I am disappointed that our distinguished majority leader objected \ntwice to a unanimous consent to extend the expiring provisions of the \nact for 3 months. I cannot believe that my distinguished friend, the \nmajority leader,\n\n[[Page S13769]]\n\nwants these authorities to expire. I do not believe the President of \nthe United States would be willing to let these provisions expire when \nwe all agree they are important tools for our Nation's law enforcement \nauthorities. It would be irresponsible and a dereliction of duty for \nthe administration to allow these provisions to expire. By refusing to \nreauthorize these parts of the PATRIOT Act, the President and the \nRepublican leadership are playing politics with the American people's \nsafety.\n  We have bipartisan support for reauthorizing the PATRIOT Act. That \nwas proven in a unanimous vote in the Senate. We want a 3-month \nextension of the PATRIOT Act in its current form so that we can pass a \nbetter bill than the one that came before the Senate today in the form \nof a conference report, a better bill that will have the confidence of \nthe American people. The American people are afraid. They are afraid of \nBig Brother. We, this great country, should not become Big Brother. We \nneed more checks in this law to protect the privacy of ordinary \nAmerican citizens who have nothing to do with terrorism. I support \ngiving the Government the tools it needs to fight terrorism. I voted \nfor the first PATRIOT Act, but we need more oversight and checks to \nprotect against Government overreaching and abuse of these tools.\n  We have had these years to find out how the first PATRIOT Act worked. \nWe know there were problems with the first PATRIOT Act. We need to \ncorrect these problems. Just as Senator McCain persuaded the President, \nwe needed to check potential excesses in interrogation tactics. We also \nneed to ensure that we have put in place checks on the Government's \npower to trample on the privacy of innocent Americans.\n  I would hope people would understand that legislation is the art of \ncompromise and that the Republican leadership in the Senate, in the \nHouse, and the White House should move to work on a compromise, accept \nour 3-month suggestion, giving Senators Leahy and Specter, the leaders \nof our Judiciary Committee, time to work out the differences.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/16/senate-section/article/S13769-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13769]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ARCTIC NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to quickly comment on another matter of vital \nimportance to the country. It appears that the majority is strongly \nconsidering whether to hold our troops hostage at a time of war in \norder to sneak in a last minute special interest rider that cannot be \npassed within the Senate's rules. Senate Democrats support the Defense \nappropriations conference report, but it would be an egregious abuse of \npower on behalf of the oil and gas industry to allow the thing we call \nANWR to violate the Senate rules and attach a special interest \nprovision in this legislation. Because Republicans cannot get the \nsupport for this provision in the House, the Senate would be asked to \nviolate our rules so that the majority can reward its friends in the \noil and gas industry.\n  We had procedures in the Senate where we lost on ANWR. It was placed \nin a bill called reconciliation. The House stripped it out. We did not. \nLet us play by the rules.\n  I do not support ANWR. It is the most important issue in America to \nthe environmental community. There is no issue more important than \nANWR. It is a sign of what this country is all about environmentally. \nIf the majority proceeds along this course and is permitted to abuse \nits power and run roughshod over the Senate rules, there will be no \nprohibition against exceeding the scope of conference on any conference \nreport. To further show the cynicism of people who are pushing this, \nthey are telling people: Do not worry about it, we will violate the \nrules today, change precedent, and we will change them right back \ntomorrow.\n  This is an abuse of power. It would have far-reaching consequences \nfor this body. It would be a huge mistake for the Senate and the \nAmerican people. We can do better than that. Let us have a fair fight \nwhere we have winners and losers. That is the way ANWR was done. I was \ndisappointed when that was lost, but it was lost fairly and squarely. \nDo not violate the rules. That is what I tell my friends on the other \nside.\n  We realize that with the 45 votes we have, we cannot do it on our \nown. We need help from people of good will on the other side of the \naisle. There are people who believe as fervently in this environmental \nstandard as I do, and I would call upon them to vote their conscience, \nto do what is right for this body and do what is right for this \ncountry. This is a procedural vote that makes the Senate different from \nany legislative body in the history of the world. The Senate is the \ngreatest deliberative body in the history of the world. Do not be \nplaying fast and loose with the rules that govern this Senate.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we have been informed that President \nBush's radio address tomorrow will be about the PATRIOT Act. It is not \na surprise. This is an important issue. It is one we should discuss and \nshould discuss as a nation.\n  We passed the PATRIOT Act because of our concern about the threat of \nterrorism. It is an act with over 100 different provisions in it. It \nwas passed with only one dissenting vote in the Senate. It included \nsunset provisions on some controversial parts of it, so that 4 years \nafter we passed it we could take another look to make sure that, in \nfact, we had done the right thing, we were not overstepping. We want to \ngive our Government enough power to protect us, but we certainly don't \nwant to surrender our basic rights and liberties if it is not needed.\n  So we had the reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act up before us and \ndebated it in the Senate Judiciary Committee on which I serve. We \nreached a bipartisan consensus for reauthorizing that act, a unanimous \nvote at the Senate Judiciary Committee. I have never seen it on an \nissue of this magnitude, but it happened. I believe it was an \nindication that there is a reasonable way to craft the PATRIOT Act so \nthat, in fact, it serves our needs of national security but does not go \ntoo far. That bill then passed the Senate on a voice vote. There was no \ncontroversy, no debate, because we had struck a legitimate bipartisan \ncompromise.\n  Then the bill went to conference, and in conference other forces were \nat work. As a result of their work, the bill was changed. It was \nchanged in significant ways, ways which I believe went too far, too far \nin giving the Government authority and power over our personal lives \nand privacy that is unnecessary. I believe that any person suspected of \ncriminal or terrorist activity, any activity that is considered to be \npart of a terrorist network, should be treated in the harshest and most \nserious way. I want to keep America safe. I want my family, my \nchildren, everyone's family, to be safe. But I want to make certain \nthat when we draw up this PATRIOT Act, we do not go too far.\n  As a result of the conference committee, a bipartisan group of \nSenators, Republicans and Democrats, came together in opposition to \nthis conference report--a bipartisan group of Senators. Today, this \nmorning, we had a vote on the Senate floor. This vote was what we call \ncloture, whether we will close debate, and as a result of the vote the \nmatter is still open, still unresolved.\n  It is important to know one thing before the President's address. I \nhope the President will honestly tell the American people tomorrow what \nhappened today in the Senate.\n  Early this morning, Senator Frist, who is on the floor at this \nmoment, the Republican majority leader, met with Senator Harry Reid, \nthe Democratic leader, to discuss this important topic. At the time, \nSenator Reid told him that we believed we were not going to close down \ndebate on the PATRIOT Act and asked if there was a way that we could \nreach an agreement on a bipartisan basis to extend the bill, extend\n\n[[Page S13770]]\n\nthe PATRIOT Act for at least 3 months.\n  We were unable to reach an agreement at that meeting.\n  Then on the floor Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, on behalf of the \nDemocrats, offered before the vote to the Republican side of the aisle \nto extend the PATRIOT Act as it is presently written for 3 months so \nthat there would not be any possible gap in coverage for the security \nof America. There was an objection from the Republican side.\n  After the cloture vote on the PATRIOT Act--in fact, cloture was not \ninvoked--another motion was made, this time by Senator Patrick Leahy of \nVermont. Senator Leahy asked for a 3-month extension of the PATRIOT Act \nso we could work out the differences.\n  Not once, not twice, but three separate times today on the Democratic \nside of the aisle we have reached out to the Republican side of the \naisle and said let us try to resolve our differences in a bipartisan \nway, let us try to make sure that we extend the PATRIOT Act so there is \nno question about the security of America.\n  Tomorrow the President will address this issue. I hope in the course \nof addressing it the President acknowledges the obvious. We have tried \nour very best on a bipartisan basis to extend the PATRIOT Act, once \ninformally and twice on the floor of the Senate today, and all three \ntimes it has been rejected.\n  We will continue to make that offer on the Democratic side. We want \nto work this out. We want a good PATRIOT Act that protects America and \nprotects our freedoms. We believe we can be safe in America and we can \nbe free.\n  I think a bipartisan vote today is a message to the White House and \nto the House conferees that the Senate bill that was passed, a \ncarefully crafted bill, is a bill that should get us into the \nreauthorization of the PATRIOT Act.\n  We stand ready to work with our Republican colleagues on a bipartisan \nbasis to make sure we have a good, strong PATRIOT Act reauthorized and \nprotecting America, and take out those objectionable provisions which \ngo too far in invading the personal rights of and privacy of innocent \nAmerican citizens.\n  I hope that particular scenario I described, which is on the official \nrecord today, is part of the President's message tomorrow.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/16/senate-section/article/S13770-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13770]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION AUTHORIZATION\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, the conference report on the \nauthorization of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration is \nin its final stages of being approved. There are some things that are \nstill to be worked out, but I am proud to have been the subcommittee \nchairman of the NASA Science Subcommittee that produced--along with the \nHouse, of course, and the full Commerce Committee--what I think is an \nexcellent authorization of our National Aeronautics and Space \nAdministration.\n  I worked with my colleague, Senator Nelson of Florida, to produce a \nbill that does envision the flight to space, the flight to the moon \nagain, and then to Mars. It is the vision laid out by President Bush in \nJanuary of 2004. It is incumbent on Congress to lead the National \nAeronautics and Space Administration and also to support it fully so \nthat we will continue the vision that John F. Kennedy had when he said: \nWe will put a man on the moon. Now we can take it the next step and put \na man on Mars, a woman on Mars.\n  It is important that we understand that this is important not only \nbecause it is a huge feat and victory for the world that we can do this \nbut also because we get so much basic science from making this \ncommitment. It improves our quality of life right here on Earth.\n  This conference committee report does authorize funding for NASA at \n$17.9 billion in 2007 and $18.7 billion for 2008. That gets us on track \nto fund the shuttles that will continue to build out the space station \nand also to begin immediate work on the crew return vehicle that will \nbe the next generation of vehicle going into space after the space \nstation has been completed.\n  It is a congressional responsibility to set the parameters for what \nwe do with NASA, and we are taking that responsibility seriously. We \nbelieve that we should finish the space station, finish the \ninternational commitment that we have made to our partners and allies \nwho have put millions of dollars in the space station, and so that we \ncan continue the basic science research necessary, not only for us to \nlearn how we can live and work in space for those people who will be \ngoing to the moon again and then later to Mars but also for the basic \ngeological findings we know we can find if we explore the Moon and \nhopefully Mars. And something that was said at one of our Commerce \nCommittee hearings by Dr. Sam Ting of MIT, there is very important \nphysics research that using the cosmic rays to determine how we might \nhave alternative forms of energy is a very important purpose for the \nspace station to be completed.\n  This report also designates the U.S. portion of the space station as \na national laboratory so that we can bring other funds besides NASA \nfunds, besides Government funds into the space station, and that will \nhelp make sure we are able to do the most possible research and make \nthe best use of the space station. It demonstrates that Congress puts a \ngreat value on the research that can be done aboard the space station \nand also a great value on keeping our word to our international \npartners.\n  America must lead in the space exploration and science area, but we \nmust do it in collaboration with other countries. I don't think we \nshould just consider ourselves competitors with other countries. If we \nare going to be the leader, we should lead. We should go forward. We \nshould break the barriers. And we should share with others what we have \nlearned for the good of mankind. That is exactly what this bill \nenvisions.\n  It also supports aeronautical research. This has been a fundamental \npart of NASA activities since its inception. It will allow us to \ncontinue the great work that has been done in the past. It will assure \nthat we take the next step toward the crew return vehicle that will \nreplace the shuttle at the earliest possible time. We will accelerate \nthat process.\n  I am very proud of this conference report. The House and Senate \nworked together very well. It was a bipartisan effort and a bicameral \neffort. We are going to see a new impetus for NASA with the support of \nCongress and the President. That is exactly what this country should be \ndoing at this time.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/16/senate-section/article/S13770-2", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13770-S13772]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                        Staff Sergeant Dan Cuka\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON.

Charlie Battery was mobilized \nin July 2005 and deployed to the Middle East in October 2005. Staff \nSergeant Cuka died when multiple improvised explosive devices detonated \nnear his military vehicle in Baghdad, Iraq.\n  Dan is survived by his wife of 5 years, Melissa, and their children, \nAbby and Alex. Melissa remembers him as, ``living each day of his life \nthe way he chose based on devotion to his family and his passion for \nthe military. We all believe Dan died doing what he strongly believed \nin.'' He was regarded as taking his military duty very seriously, and \nhis leadership in his battalion reflected that. Dan was a devoted \nfather who would do anything for his kids according to Melissa, ``It \nwasn't just as a provider. He would get on the floor and play with \nthem. He would take them places and have a good time with them.''\n  The lives of countless people were enormously enhanced by Dan's good \nwill and service. Although he did not live to see his dreams realized, \nhe continues to inspire all those who knew him. Our Nation and South \nDakota are far better places because of his life, and the best way to \nhonor his life is to emulate his commitment to our country.\n  Mr. President, I express my sympathies to the family and friends of\n\n[[Page S13771]]\n\nStaff Sergeant Cuka.

His brother, SSG Brooks Schild, described him \nby saying, ``Rich would always put others ahead of himself, even when \nhe was in a dangerous situation.'' According to his brother, Richard \nhad earned the respect and admiration of his fellow soldiers, not \nmerely because of his rank, but because of who he was as a person. He \nserved with great distinction and received numerous accolades for his \nservice.\n  Richard lived life to the fullest and was committed to his family, \nhis Nation, and his community. It was his incredible dedication to \nhelping others that will serve as his greatest legacy. All Americans \nowe Richard, and the other soldiers who have made the ultimate \nsacrifice in defense of freedom, a tremendous debt of gratitude for \ntheir service.\n  Mr. President, I express my sympathies to the family and friends of \nSFC Richard Schild. I believe the best way to honor him is to emulate \nhis commitment to our country. I know he will always be missed, but his \nservice to our Nation will never be forgotten.\n\n\n        aviation warfare systems operator two john n. kaye, iii\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today for the purpose of honoring \na fallen American. I learned this week that AW2 John N. Kaye III, from \nTraer, IA, died while in service to his country during counter \nnarcotics operations off the coast of Colombia. I would like to take \nthis opportunity to salute his patriotism and his sacrifice.\n  We can often tell a lot about the character of an individual by how \nthey help the people around them. Petty Officer Kaye was a man who \nwould willingly extend a helping hand to those around him and this week \neven extended his mission to help out a fellow sailor. Just before \nleaving the Navy, though, he extended his stay aboard the USS DeWert \nfor one final mission so that another sailor could be with his family \nto mourn the loss of a brother. Sadly, Petty Officer Kaye gave his life \nin service to his country on Tuesday off the coast of Colombia.\n  John Kaye was looking forward the completion of his tour of duty in \nthe Navy so that he could return to Iowa to be near family and friends \nand attend college. He was from a large family in central Iowa and \nattended North Tama High School where he played football. In his free \ntime, he loved to hunt and fish or just spend time with his friends in \nthe Traer area. In the Navy, he was one of the youngest people to ever \ngraduate from the Search and Rescue Program where he received training \nas a rescue swimmer.\n  The primary mission for members of our military is to protect \nAmerican citizens from outside threats. For John Kaye, the threat was \ndrugs being grown and processed in South America, and he was actively \ninvolved in our effort to reduce the flow of illegal drugs into the \nUnited States. The Navy is an important partner in our efforts to track \ndown and apprehend drug traffickers in the Pacific Ocean and the \nCaribbean Sea, and John Kaye deserves the highest gratitude of this \nbody and the entire Nation. His sacrifice reminds us that freedom is so \nprecious because of its incredibly high cost. This is an example of the \npatriotic contribution made by thousands of American service members \nand their families. The love of country and dedication to service \nshared by so many of its citizens is the great strength of our Nation, \nand we can all be very proud of patriots like John Kaye.\n  Mrs. BOXER.

Mr. President, on May 15, 2005, Ethiopia held the first \nopen, multiparty, democratic elections in its 3,000-year history. It \nwas an important milestone that gave the people of that country a sense \nof national pride and hope. Unfortunately, the elation that was so \nevident on election day was short lived. International observers cited \nserious vote counting irregularities and flaws in the electoral \nprocess.\n  Nearly 25 million Ethiopians--90 percent of eligible voters--went to \nthe polls, and early counts indicated strong support for the \nopposition. As it became clear that the ruling party was in danger of \nlosing its grip on power, the\n\n[[Page S13773]]\n\nGovernment stopped the vote counting in a blatant move to manipulate \nthe results. Accusations of vote rigging forced the National Electoral \nBoard of Ethiopia, NEBE, to delay the release of the official results.\n  The controversy led to protests in Addis Ababa, the Oromiya regions, \nand other provinces. On June 8, in response to protesters challenging \nthe provisional results of the elections, Ethiopian security forces are \naccused of shooting at least 40 protestors, killing 26, temporarily \ndetaining over 500 student protestors and arresting at least 50 people. \nEthiopia's main opposition political party, the Coalition for Unity and \nDemocracy Party, CUDP, refused to take its seats in Parliament in \nprotest of the election results. Just recently, 50 members of the CUDP \ntook their seats in Parliament, but there is some concern that they \nwere pressured into doing so.\n  Last month, the situation in Ethiopia took a further turn for the \nworse. On November 1, following street demonstrations that erupted into \n4 days of violence when police started shooting, at least 46 protesters \nwere killed in Addis Ababa and other towns, and some 4,000 were \narrested. There have been numerous reports of widespread arbitrary \ndetention, beatings, torture, disappearances, and the use of excessive \nforce by police and soldiers against anyone suspected of supporting the \nCUDP detainees.\n  The detainees include distinguished Ethiopian patriots such as Hailu \nShawel, president of the CUDP; Professor Mesfin Woldemariam, former \nchair of the Ethiopian Human Rights Council; Dr. Yacob Hailemariam, a \nformer U.N. Special Envoy and former prosecutor at the International \nCriminal Tribunal for Rwanda; Ms. Birtukan Mideksa, CUDP vice president \nand a former judge; and Dr. Berhanu Negga, the recently elected mayor \nof Addis Ababa and university professor of economics.\n  Today, the entire senior leadership of the CUDP is reportedly in jail \nand has been held incommunicado in harsh conditions, without access to \ntheir families or legal representatives. Amnesty International \nconsiders these individuals to be prisoners of conscience who have \nneither used nor advocated violence. The government of Prime Minister \nMeles Zenawi is seeking to charge them with treason, a capital offense, \nfor the ``crime'' of urging their supporters to engage in peaceful \nprotest on their behalf. CUDP leaders are scheduled to appear in court \ntoday, presumably to be officially charged with treason.\n  Journalists and members of the media have also been jailed. According \nto the Committee to Protect Journalists, Ethiopian authorities have \nprevented most private newspapers from publishing, arrested or harassed \nlocal journalists and their family members, and threatened to charge \njournalists with treason. Thirteen journalists have been detained since \nlast month's antigovernment protests, including two more who were just \narrested this week.\n  It is particularly disturbing, when one considers these events, that \nsince 1991, the government of Prime Minister Meles has received \nbillions of dollars in foreign aid, including to strengthen democratic \ninstitutions and the rule of law in his country. Recently, the European \nUnion suspended its aid to Prime Minister Meles' government and is \nseeking ways to channel it to the Ethiopian people through private \nvoluntary organizations.\n  Last month, thousands of Ethiopians and their supporters in this \ncountry came to Washington to protest the violence and repression by \nthe Meles government and to urge the Bush administration to help \nestablish real democracy and the rule of law in Ethiopia. Ethiopia has \nbeen an ally of the United States in combating international terrorism, \nyet it is using similar tactics against its own people.\n  Over the past several years, Ethiopia has made progress in both \npolitical reform and economic development. But that progress has been \novershadowed by the tragic events of the past 6 months. The \nGovernment's heavy-handed tactics to steal the election and persecute \nthose who sought to play by the rules of democracy, should be \nuniversally condemned.\n  The Bush administration should make clear to Prime Minister Meles \nthat if his government does not abide by the basic principles of \ndemocracy, due process and respect for human rights, including an end \nto the use of random searches, beatings, mass arrests and lethal force \nagainst peaceful protesters, and if political detainees are not \nreleased, that we will join with the European Union and suspend our aid \nto his government, including our support for financing from the World \nBank and the African Development Bank other than for basic human needs. \nThere should be severe consequences for such a flagrant subversion of \nthe will of the Ethiopian people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/16/senate-section/article/S13773-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13773]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate \ncrimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable \nin our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to \nhighlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  On January 30, 1999, a 23-year-old disabled man was lured into an \napartment in Keansburg, NJ. He was than subjected to three hours of \ntorture at the hands of nine men and women. According to police, the \nabusers knew the man from their neighborhood, and ridiculed him \nconstantly because of his disability.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/16/senate-section/article/S13773-2", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13773]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               CAREGIVERS\n\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, across the country there are more than 6 \nmillion children living in households headed by a grandparent or other \nrelative. Regardless of the reason children enter relative--care the \ndeath of a parent, neglect, abuse, military deployment, or poverty--it \nis never, ever the fault of the child. I commend grandparents and other \nrelatives who step forward to care for these children, keeping the \nchildren out of foster care while providing safe, stable homes, often \nat great personal sacrifice.\n  In my state of Illinois, 9 percent of the children live with \nnonparent relatives. Grandparents and other relative caregivers often \nprovide the best chance for a loving and stable childhood for the \nchildren in their care, but their hard work and dedication often goes \nunnoticed. Today I offer my formal acknowledgement and deepest \nappreciation for the ongoing service of these caregivers to our country \nand our Nation's most valuable asset--our children.\n  There are still far too many barriers preventing grandparent- and \nother relative-caregivers from accessing the services they need. For \nexample, even though grandparent-caregivers are eligible for many \nhousing programs through the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment, HUD officials on the ground often unwittingly exclude \ngrandparents from accessing housing because of confusion over the \nrelevant laws. For this reason, I recently worked with my colleague \nSenator Stabenow to obtain $4 million in new funding for grandparent-\ncaregiver housing demonstration projects.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to improve access to services for grandparent- and other \nrelative-headed households. My grandparents played a central role in my \nupbringing, and without them I would not be standing before you today. \nI am certain that the same can be said of thousands of children and \nadults in Illinois and across the country. It is time that we recognize \nthe contributions of these worthy relative-caregivers, and grant them \nthe access to Federal services that they deserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/16/senate-section/article/S13773-3", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13773-S13775]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CONFIRMATION OF SUSAN BODINE\n\n  Mrs. BOXER.

An electronic version of the document (``template'') \n     provided to the Committee in an enclosure to a letter signed \n     by me on October 31, 2005 (available immediately);\n       2. An updated version of the list entitled, ``Currently \n     Projected Projects Ready for Construction Funding in FY05,'' \n     previously provided to the Committee in an enclosure to a \n     letter signed by John Reeder on July 19, 2005. The list will \n     include a column displaying ``actual'' FY 2005 funds provided \n     to each site on the list, and a column that provides a code \n     characterizing the nature of human health or ecological risk \n     at each site (available immediately);\n       3. In response to the Committee's question on site funding \n     needs, EPA's CERCLIS database provides the most complete \n     existing record. EPA will provide reports from the CERCLIS \n     database (SCAP-4 ``snapshot'') from late summer of 2004 \n     reflecting each regional office's planning estimates for \n     funding prior to budget discussions with EPA headquarters. To \n     determine the date of the ``snapshot'' that provides the best \n     information on funding each region will be asked to identify \n     the date that best reflects when the region loaded its \n     assessment of planning data into CERCLIS, prior to changes \n     based on discussions with headquarters. Also, EPA will \n     provide a coversheet that summarizes relevant planning data \n     and FY 2005 obligations, and EPA's operating plan and \n     preliminary allocation memo for FY 2005 (available by January \n     31, 2006).\n       4. Additional information from Regional offices on \n     opportunities for accelerated remedial actions at Superfund \n     sites categorized by EPA as ``Human Exposure Not Under \n     Control'' (available by January 31, 2006).\n       To collect information under this item, we will ask the \n     regional offices the following: Explain the known \n     opportunities for the use of additional FY 2005 funds to \n     accelerate response actions, including removal actions, \n     remedial actions, and any characterization or testing that \n     could have accelerated remedial action. Include description \n     of costs of these opportunities, if know. If action was not \n     undertaking in FY 2005, explain why not, including funding \n     limitations. Please indicate if the opportunity for \n     accerlated response action still exists, or if conditions at \n     the site present new opportunities for accelerated actions \n     since FY 2005. Include the information in the attached \n     template, and attach copies of supporting documentation.\n       Please contact me if I can be of further assistance, or \n     your staff may call me on 564-5200.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Stephanie N.

Mr. President, while a complete response to my request \nremains outstanding, I have determined that with the additional \ncommitments I received today, the confirmation of Ms. Bodine can \nproceed with the expectation and assurance from Ms. Bodine to work \nclosely with me and provide cooperation on the oversight of this \nprogram.\n  In addition, the Chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, Senator Inhofe, has agreed that the Superfund program and \nits critical missions are overdue for a comprehensive oversight hearing \nand that such a hearing shall be held in the Superfund and Waste \nManagement Subcommittee of which I am ranking member. Senator Thune, \nthe chairman of the subcommittee, has also agreed to this request.\n  There have been no comprehensive oversight hearings of this important \npublic health program in over 3 years. Ms. Bodine has agreed to testify \nat this hearing after her confirmation, and we will have other outside \nwitnesses as well. We have also requested that Administrator Stephen \nJohnson be available as well. I want to thank my colleague, Senator \nInhofe for agreeing to this critical hearing.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, both subcommittee Chairman Thune and I \nrecognize the importance of oversight of the Superfund program. To that \nend, and consistent with Senator Boxer's request, Senator Thune's \nsubcommittee will be holding an oversight hearing of EPA's Superfund \nprogram once Susan Bodine, the President's nominee to head EPA's Office \nof Solid Waste and Emergency Response, is confirmed by the Senate with \nMs. Bodine testifying on behalf of EPA. After Ms. Bodine is confirmed, \nwe will begin to work on scheduling this hearing with a targeted time \nframe of the first quarter of 2006, but no later than the Memorial Day \nrecess. Senator Thune will work closely with Senator Boxer in \nscheduling the hearing.\n  I expect EPA to be forthcoming in this hearing about the program and \nlook forward to Ms. Bodine's confirmation so that she may help ensure \nthat the EPA is responsive to the Senator's requests for information \nabout the management of the program and the impacts on communities \nthroughout the country.\n  Mr. THUNE. I am in full agreement with the chairman of the \nEnvironment & Public Works Committee and I will be working closely with \nhim and subcommittee ranking member Boxer on scheduling this hearing \nonce Ms. Bodine is confirmed.

Mr. President, I rise today, to discuss a matter of \nserious concern. On December 9, The Washington Post reported that the \nDepartment of Defense is investigating a video posted on an Aegis-\nemployee affiliated Web site which contains scenes of violence and \nshooting against Iraqi civilians.\n  An estimated 25,000 private security contractors are currently \nworking in Iraq, earning anywhere from $550 to $1,500 a day. Many of \nthem are doing their best to help maintain security for the \nreconstruction of Iraq. However, if the events displayed in the video \nare accurate, the actions of these few contractors put our troops at \ntremendous risk. The video depicts the back window of a PSD, personal \nsecurity detail, vehicle. In the video you can hear a machine gun being \nfired at cars which are clearly more than 50 meters behind the vehicle. \nThe cars drift off the road after many shots, leaving one to assume the \ndriver has been shot dead. During the entire video, the Elvis Presley \nsong ``Mystery Train'' plays in the background.\n  This behavior is offensive. The actions of the individuals in the \nvideo put our troops at risk because such incendiary behavior only \nincreases hatred towards Americans. Whether or not we agree with the \ntroops' presence in Iraq, we all agree that the safety of our troops is \nparamount. Our troops in Iraq who wear uniforms are instant targets for \nretaliatory violence.\n  The U.S. service men and women who deploy to Iraq serve because of a \nsense of selfless service and duty. As members of Congress, it is our \nduty to conduct oversight into the questionable behavior of the private \nsecurity contractors. While our troops continue to be deployed to Iraq \nand the security situation remains fragile at best, it is in our best \ninterest to make sure civilian-contractors do not exacerbate the \nsituation any further.\n  Therefore, I will be seeking a congressional inquiry into the \noperations and rules of engagement granted to private security \ncontractors currently operating in Iraq. I will also recommend a review \nof the contract awarded to Aegis Specialist Risk Management. If these \nevents are happening, we must stop them. We must take action so that \nour troops and the Iraqi people know that gratuitous violence on the \npart of the people we deploy or employ will not be tolerated.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/16/senate-section/article/S13775-2", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13775]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n INCLUSION OF IDAHO AND MONTANA IN THE RADIATION EXPOSURE COMPENSATION \n                                  ACT\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise in support of this bill to expand \nthe Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, RECA, to include the States of \nIdaho and Montana.

This bill, consistent studies \nshowing that parts of Idaho and Montana were among the most affected, \nexpands RECA geographically to include these two States.\n  My colleagues and I are in the business of making Idahoans eligible \nfor RECA compensation as expeditiously as possible. Studies that take \nyears will simply not do for citizens who would otherwise be eligible \nif they lived on the other side of a State line.\n  The NAS recommended that RECA should be overhauled, and I will make \nsure this happens. In the meantime, those Idahoans and Montanans who \nqualify for compensation today should be made eligible immediately.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/16/senate-section/article/S13775-3", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13775]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 BURMA\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I will discuss the disturbing \nsituation in Burma.\n  I have consistently stressed my deep concerns regarding the \nrepressive military junta in Burma that continues to commit severe \nhuman rights violations against the Burmese people. Despite consistent \ncalls to halt abuses by the Burmese military such as rape, harsh \npolitical repression, torture, extrajudicial executions, forced labor, \nand human trafficking, the SPDC fails to address these egregious \nviolations and permits violations to continue with impunity.\n  However, I am encouraged by ASEAN's rejuvenated efforts to hold Burma \nto long-promised democratic reforms. ASEAN's resolute calls for the \nrelease of Aung San Suu Kyi and other members of NLD and more than \n1,100 political prisoners, and for real democratic reform, are vital to \nlegitimate progress in Burma and regional stability and values. ASEAN \nhas long pushed for these goals and its recent announcement that it \nwill send an envoy to evaluate Burma's progress in democratic reform is \nan important step toward accountability.\n  It is far past time for the international community to begin a \ndialogue on Burma. I welcome the unanimous decision by the United \nNations Security Council to discuss the situation there. The September \n2005 report produced by Nobel Prize laureate Desmond Tutu and former \nCzech President Vaclav Havel provided a solid basis for these \ndiscussions. Burma's military junta has long prevented United Nations \nenvoys from visiting, and I look forward to the international community \nengaging in a serious discussion of the situation there.\n  Those demanding real reform in Burma must not relent. The SPDC must \ntake immediate steps to release Aung Sang Suu Kyi and other political \nprisoners and to create a broad-based democratic government that \nrespects human rights and the rule of law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/16/senate-section/article/S13775-4", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13775-S13776]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 WORK OUTAGE AT CALLAWAY NUCLEAR PLANT\n\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I rise to honor approximately 3,000 \npermanent and supplemental workers, who recently set a new world time \nrecord while conducting a safe and successful work outage on AmerenUE's \nCallaway Nuclear Plant. The Callaway Plant is located in my home State \nof Missouri and provides permanent jobs to more than 1,000 people. \nSince 1984, Callaway has generated an average of 8.9 billion \nkilowatthours of electricity per year--equal to the amount used \nannually by more than 750,000 average households.\n  The Callaway Plant is owned and operated by AmerenUE, a subsidiary of \nAmeren Corporation, which provides energy services to about 2.3 million \nelectric customers in Missouri and Illinois. Callaway, along with 102 \nother nuclear powerplants in the United States, is a critical component \nof our Nation's energy mix, providing low-cost, reliable, and clean \nenergy from an abundant fuel source.\n  Approximately every 18 months nuclear plants must be shut down for \nrefueling, during which time the employees perform literally thousands \nof maintenance activities, modifications, and tests. In Callaway's \ncase, the plant supplies nearly a quarter of Ameren's electricity \nproduction, thus it is critical that the work be done in a safe and \ntimely manner so the plant can be brought back online as soon as \npossible.\n  The recent Callaway Plant outage was the most complex in its history, \nas it included not only refueling and the usual maintenance activities, \nbut also replacement of four massive steam generators, which measure 70 \nfeet tall and weigh 400 tons each, as well as main turbine rotors. The \nCallaway team set a new world record for such outages, accomplishing \ntheir work in 63 days and 13 hours, beating the previous record of 64 \ndays and 17 hours. The combination of the new generators and rotors are \nexpected to add about 60 megawatts of additional generating capacity to \nthe plant using the same amount of fuel.\n  This summer Congress passed an energy bill, which recognizes the \ntremendous need for increasing our supply of clean energy while \nreducing our dependence on foreign sources of energy. The high-quality \nwork of the Callaway employees plays a major role in carrying out the \nobjectives of this important legislation. By not only completing the \noutage in a safe and timely\n\n[[Page S13776]]\n\nmanner, but also increasing its capacity to produce electricity, these \nworkers are doing their part to meet Missouri's--and our Nation's--\ngrowing energy needs.\n  I offer my personal thanks and congratulations for a job well done to \nall of the dedicated employees and the temporary workers who, as a \nresult of exceptional preparation, teamwork, and execution, \nsuccessfully completed the most complex outage at Callaway Nuclear \nPlant.\n  I congratulate the AmerenUE workers and their partners on their \nachievement. They have set a new standard of excellence in safety and \nperformance and have helped advance the future of the nuclear power \nindustry as a whole.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/16/senate-section/article/S13776-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13776]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           MISSILE DEFENSE AGENCY'S RECENT TESTING SUCCESSES\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise to comment on an event that may \nhave understandably escaped the attention of my colleagues because our \nplate is full and the schedule is tight. I want to underscore the \nimportance of what occurred on Tuesday night, December 13, shortly \nafter 10 p.m. Washington time. It signaled a month of great achievement \nin our Nation's Missile Defense Program.\n  While many of us were turning on the late news that night, an \noperationally configured, ground-based interceptor missile, of the kind \nnow emplaced in both Alaska and California, was launched out of its \nsilo in the Marshall Islands and successfully completed all its major \ntest objectives. It demonstrated smooth execution of the launch \nsequence, separation of the booster-kill vehicle, cryogenic cooling of \nthe sensor, and positioning of the kill vehicle, among many other \ncomplex actions. For this test, there was a simulated target using data \nfrom previous launches. The interceptor successfully flew through its \nimpact point, and had the target been real, it would have been \ndestroyed.\n  This test was the latest in an extraordinary month. National \nattention had been focused on setbacks to our defense against long-\nrange hostile ballistic missiles. However, this has been a month of \nsuccesses for current and future elements of the Ballistic Missile \nDefense System that can provide a defense against both long-range and \nshort-range threats. Perhaps these successes have flown under our radar \nscreens, but now they deserve recognition.\n  In addition to this most recent test, there are at least three others \nthat occurred in the past month worthy of note.\n  On November 17, an Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense SM-3 interceptor, \nlaunched by an operational crew from the USS Lake Erie off the coast of \nHawaii, made a direct hit on an inert warhead that separated from a \ntarget missile 100 miles in space--a far more challenging scenario than \nprevious tests. This was the sixth successful intercept by a SM-3 in \nthe last seven such tests since testing began in 2002. The successful \nintercept of a separating warhead advances our defense beyond simpler, \nunitary, Scud-like missiles.\n\n  Just as important was the return to flight of the terminal high \naltitude area defense, or THAAD, interceptor. After its last two \nsuccessful flights in 1999, the program and the missile were completely \noverhauled to make it more reliable and easier to manufacture. On \nNovember 22, the revamped missile was launched from the White Sands \nMissile Range without a flaw. The test validated the interceptor's \nlaunch from canister, rocket booster operation, shroud and kill vehicle \nseparation, and control system that guides it to the target for a kill.\n  And not least, just last week, on December 6, the Airborne Laser \nProgram successfully completed a full duration lase at operational \npower. This involved linking the energy output of six large laser \nmodules into a single beam, powerful enough to destroy a missile in its \nboost phase at the distances we need to shoot to kill. Now that the \nlaser has successfully completed ground testing in a surrogate \naircraft, it is being disassembled to load it onto its flight test \nBoeing 747 for further testing. The significance of achieving this \nmilestone cannot be overemphasized--this is a revolutionary weapon with \nthe potential to change fundamentally the ways in which we can protect \nour Nation, our troops, and our allies and friends from the growing \nballistic missile threat.\n  These are the more visible Elements of the integrated Ballistic \nMissile Defense System. What ties all these parts together is the \nGlobal Command, Control, Battle Management and Communications System, \nthe brain and the nerves. It is less visible than radars and rockets, \nbut our missile defenses couldn't work without it. The integration of \nfar-flung parts, new and upgraded, often made at different times by \ndifferent contractors, has been a great challenge, but it is one we are \nsteadily and remarkably overcoming.\n  There have been many naysayers and doubters on missile defense. But I \nam proud to have supported the Missile Defense Agency over the past \nyear as it has grappled in an intensive effort to track down and \neliminate or minimize risks that have contributed to setbacks in the \npast. There is an emphasis on quality that is paying off, as witnessed \nby these last four successful tests. We learn from our mistakes, and we \nnow bear the fruit of the combined efforts of a wide range of dedicated \nmilitary, civilian, and contractor personnel. Testing will continue, we \nwill encounter difficulties, but the program will move forward. We are \nsucceeding in building an integrated and layered Ballistic Missile \nDefense System, our defenses will continue to improve, and our citizens \nwill be increasingly protected and grateful.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/16/senate-section/article/S13776-2", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13776-S13777]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RADIATION EXPOSURE COMPENSATION ACT\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, on April 28, 2005 of this year, just hours \nafter the National Academy of Science released its report, I stood \nbefore this body and declared the importance of amending this law. On \nMay 9, I introduced S. 977 which places Montana on equal ground with \nothers who have suffered from nuclear testing fallout. Again, on May \n10, I stood in this Chamber and talked about the importance of this \nlegislation for the good people of Montana. Today, I am happy to be \njoined in my efforts by the Senator from Idaho, who introduced similar \nlegislation for the people of Idaho. This bill is an important step \nforward in securing the justice that the people of Montana deserve. \nThis bill combines my efforts with those of Senator Crapo to extend \nRECA coverage to both Montana and Idaho in a single, simple bill.\n  Montana, more than any other State, was affected by the downwind \nradiation that came from the nuclear testing in Nevada during the \n1950s. The statistics are eye-opening. Of the 25 counties in the United \nStates with the highest exposure rates, 15 are in Montana. Meagher \nCounty in Montana has a rate of exposure greater than any other county \nin the United States. Fifty-five out of Montana's 56 counties \nexperienced elevated levels of radiation exposure. And yet, Montana is \nthe only State in the region that receives absolutely no compensation \nfrom the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act whatsoever.\n  The reported rate of thyroid cancer--which is the health affect most \nassociated with the exposure to Iodine-131 from this testing--is 17.5 \ntimes the national rate. Between 1989 and 2003, while the national rate \nof thyroid cancer increased 38 percent, Montanans saw an increase of \n127 percent.\n  When Congress passed RECA in 1990, it was an important step toward \nsetting a grave injustice right. As a cancer survivor myself, I know \nthat no amount of money can heal the wounds suffered by the victims of \nradiation exposure. Time and time again, I have heard from Montanans \nwho tell me that it is not about the money. The people of Montana \naren't coming to their Government with their hands out. They are \ndemanding justice. They are demanding acknowledgement of their \nsuffering. They are demanding that we do the right thing.\n  When RECA was passed in 1990, my colleagues did their best to do the \nright thing. For that, they should be commended. For the 9,117 \nAmericans who have received compensation for downwind exposure since \nRECA became law in 1990, justice has been served. Responsibility has \nbeen taken, so that wounds can begin to heal.\n  And, it wasn't an easy journey. The first hearings for RECA were held \nway back in 1979, almost 30 years ago. The questions that needed to be \nasked took time to answer: Was there downwind\n\n[[Page S13777]]\n\nradiation? Were people exposed to that radiation? Were there health \nconsequences to that exposure? And while the Senate struggled with \nthese questions, Americans that were affected waited. As my colleagues \nexpressed 20 years ago, time is not on our side in this matter, and all \ntoo often justice delayed is quite literally justice denied.\n  When Congress passed RECA in 1990, the extent of the damage done from \nthis radiation was not fully understood. New studies, by the National \nCancer Institute and the National Academy of Sciences, decades in the \nmaking, have shown that for many Americans, like those in Montana, \njustice has been denied. They live in the most affected regions of the \ncountry, and yet they find the door of justice closed to them by lines \non a map. For some of these people, it is too late. The clock is \nticking, and many have not survived long enough for their Government to \ndo the right thing.\n  That is why I stand adamant that the time to act is now. We did the \nright thing in 1990. It is time to do the right thing today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/16/senate-section/article/S13777-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13777-S13778]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       LABOR--HHS APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the fiscal year \n2006 Labor, HHS, Education and related agencies conference report.\n  As my colleagues know, this is the second conference report to come \nout of the Labor-HHS-Education Subcommittee this year. This bill, which \npassed the House yesterday by two votes, represents a failure by the \nleadership of this Congress to adequately fund health, education, and \nworkforce programs.\n  The first conference report--the one defeated by the House--contained \ndrastic cuts to existing programs like the title VII health professions \nprograms and No Child Left Behind.\n  So what is different between the bill before us today and the one \nthat failed? Does the second conference report restore the harmful cuts \nto health and education that were supported by the Republican \nleadership in the House and Senate? Does the bill contain even one \ndollar more than the bill that was defeated by the House?\n  The answer to those questions is no.\n  The first conference report included $201 million worth of cuts to \nrural health programs identified by the National Rural Health \nAssociation. The bill before us restores a few of these programs but it \nstill retains $137 million, or 68 percent, worth of those cuts.\n  The bill before us restores a provision costing $90 million that \nwould have prohibited Medicare and Medicaid from covering prescription \ndrugs for erectile dysfunction.\n  And how does this bill pay for these provisions? It is not with new \nmoney but, rather, with $120 million that was designated for the Public \nHealth and Social Services Emergency Fund for pandemic flu preparedness \nand $60 million that was supposed to go to the Centers for Medicare and \nMedicaid Services' administrative account for implementation of the new \nMedicare prescription drug benefit.\n  At a time when seniors are struggling to understand and sign up for \nthe new Medicare drug benefit, this bill cuts the account needed to run \nMedicare's 1-800 help line, run its Website Medicare.gov, conduct \noutreach and provide technical assistance to millions confused seniors.\n  And at a time when public health experts across the globe are warning \ncountries to act now to prepare for a pandemic influenza, this bill \ncuts $120 million in pandemic flu preparedness funding.\n  In total, this bill cuts health funding by $466 million.\n  That includes a cut of $185 million for the Bureau of Health \nProfessions title VII programs, making it harder to recruit and retain \nqualified health professionals, and the elimination of nine vital \nhealth programs including trauma care, rural emergency medical \nservices, the geriatric education centers, health education training \ncenters, and the health community access program.\n  In California, the elimination of the geriatric education program \nwill eliminate funding for the Northern California Geriatric Education \nCenter at the University of California San Francisco, the only source \nof Federal funding for geriatric education from the Bay Area to Oregon.\n  It provides a less than 1 percent increase in funding the National \nInstitutes of Health, the smallest percentage increase to NIH since \n1970. This bill cuts the number of new research grants that NIH can \nfund by 355, from 9,612 to 9,257.\n  Last September, 91 of my colleagues joined me in sending a letter to \nPresident Bush supporting the administration's goal of eliminating \ncancer death and suffering by 2015. The wholly inadequate funding for \nNIH in this bill dims the hope of reaching this 2015 goal.\n  The conference report harms all working American families.\n  First, the conference report slashes the Office of Disability \nEmployment Policy to $20 million, close to half of the funding in \nfiscal year 2005. The disabled community will no longer have the \ntraining, employment, and education needed to earn a decent wage. This \nis a community that already faces a 68 percent unemployment rate.\n  Second, reducing job training programs, dislocated worker assistance, \nand employment services by $530 million will make it close to \nimpossible for dislocated workers to re-enter the workforce. This is \nparticularly appalling given the recent bankruptcy and layoff \nannouncements by Delta, Northwest, and General Motors, just to name a \nfew.\n  Lastly, the reduction in trade adjustment assistance will leave \nworkers to fend for themselves when industries change and jobs shift \noversees. This is vital to the Nation's economic stability. The fast-\nmoving pace of innovation requires that we have a flexible workforce \nprovided with the training needed to transition to the next \nopportunity. Reducing this type of program will leave American workers \nbehind.\n  The ability to work is the path to financial independence, economic \nstability, and the key to earning a better life. This conference report \nshamefully denies that opportunity to dislocated and disabled workers \nwanting to earn a better life.\n  And finally, this bill hurts our Nation's schools, educators, and \nstudents.\n  It cuts total Federal education funding by $59 million for the first \ntime in over a decade.\n  Within education, No Child Left Behind is significantly cut by $779 \nmillion or 3 percent that will ultimately result in an estimated $3 \nmillion loss for California schools.\n  Furthermore, this bill shortchanges the authorized funding level for \nNo Child Left Behind programs by $13.1 billion.\n  This major cut and underfunding is being done when the required math \nand reading performance levels under the law are increasing for school \ndistricts and schools are struggling to find the funds necessary to \nmeet the law's requirements.\n  This bill also fails to provide any increase to the Pell grant \nstudent aid award of $4,050 for the fourth year in a row, even though a \n$100 increase was promised in the budget resolution.\n  Federal Pell grants are the cornerstone of our need-based financial \naid system ensuring that all students have access to higher education.\n  Pell grants help over 5.3 million low- and middle-income students \nattend college, over 500,000 of them in California.\n  There could not be a worse time for freezing student's financial \ngrant aid as the costs of attending a 4-year public college or private \ncollege have dramatically increased both nationwide and in California.\n  According to the College Board, the average cost nationwide of \nattending a public university for 1 year has increased 66 percent to \n$5,132 within the last 10 years, and yet Pell grant aid continues to \nremain stagnant.\n  This bill also drastically cuts other important education programs, \nsuch as Even Start literacy programs that help disadvantaged children \nand their parents increase their English skills are cut by 56 percent, \nfrom $200 million to $100 million; education technology State grants \nare cut by 45 percent, from $496 million to $275 million; and State \ngrants for keeping schools safe and drug free are cut by 20 percent, \nfrom $437 million to $350 million.\n  The bill before us shortchanges American families, and I believe \nAmerica can do better. The cuts in this bill for vital health, \neducation, and workforce programs are a direct result of the agenda of \nthis administration and\n\n[[Page S13778]]\n\nthe leadership in Congress: to pass tax cuts and reconciliation bills \nthat actually worsen the deficit, all the while doing nothing to \naddress the long-term fiscal picture of entitlement spending.\n  As an appropriator, I recognize that tough decisions have to be made. \nHowever, the policy choices of this administration have put Members of \nthis body in the position of having to vote on the elimination of \nhealth programs for the poorest and sickest of Americans and for cuts \nto education programs for low-income students. I reject that choice and \nbelieve we must rebalance our priorities.\n  The choice we should be making today is to improve our healthcare \nsafety net, to fully fund our schools, and to help American workers \nfind the path to financial independence and economic stability.\n  This conference report fails Americans on all those fronts, and I \nurge my colleagues to reject it.\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I strongly oppose the fiscal year \n2006 Labor-HHS appropriations conference report because it undermines \nmany of our Nation's highest priorities and jeopardizes our most \nvulnerable citizens and communities.\n  We have all heard the dire warnings about the avian flu pandemic. We \nknow that we need to invest adequate resources to develop vaccines, \nstockpile medicines, and better prepare at the local, State, and \nFederal levels. That is why the Senate passed Senator Harkin's \namendment. Yet this conference report left out those vital funds and, \nin doing so, left us far less equipped to deal with a pandemic.\n  We know we must invest in the critical research that uncovers the \nsecrets behind our greatest killers, saving the health and lives of our \ncitizens. Yet this bill increases funding for the National Institutes \nof Health, NIH, by less than one percent, the smallest increase since \n1970. Make no mistake: this will lead to cuts in the number of new \nresearch grants funded by NIH.\n  We know we have to invest in the education of our children at every \nlevel of schooling. We know our school districts, and our children, are \nbeing asked to meet tougher standards. Yet this conference report cuts \neducation for the first time in a decade. No Child Left Behind, NCLB, \nprograms have been cut 3 percent, now leaving them $13 billion below \nthe authorized level. Fewer children will be served by afterschool \nprograms, which keep our children safe after school and improve their \nacademic performance. At a time when the costs of college are \nskyrocketing, this bill once again freezes Pell grants, which help low-\nincome students afford a college education.\n  Now, this bill doesn't just cut critical funds; it also adds \nprovisions that endanger our neediest citizens. None is more troubling \nto me than the Weldon amendment. I am extremely disappointed that the \nconference report rejected the real conscience clause in the Senate \nbill and instead included the House bill's sweeping and dangerous \nrefusal clause.\n  Unlike the Senate language authored by Senator Specter and Senator \nHarkin, the provision in this conference report is not a conscience \nclause. It never mentions religion or morals.

SMITH\n\n Mr. ALLEN. Today I would like to honor a great man, Mr. Carl \nW. Smith, a native of Wise, VA, and a resident of Charlottesville, VA, \nwho, sadly, passed away earlier this week.\n  Carl Smith was a truly wonderful leader for Virginia, and my wife \nSusan and I were deeply saddened to learn of the passing of our friend. \nHis lovely wife Hunter and his children Carl, Stuart, and Hunter, will \nremain in our thoughts and prayers, as will their loved ones during \nthis time of great sorrow.\n  Throughout his life, Carl was a truly special, invigorating friend \nand remarkable, insightful leader who was always a lap ahead of \neveryone else. I will always appreciate his discreet advice, his \nimpressive perspective and his strong support. And I will be forever \ngrateful for his trusted friendship that helped me win elections to \nbecome a Delegate and, later, Governor of Virginia.\n  Like me, Carl attended the University of Virginia, when he played \nfootball. After graduating, he served in the U.S. Army and worked as an \ninvestment banker. Just last year, Carl retired as head of AMVEST \nCorporation, a diversified energy and finance corporation based in \nCharlottesville that he founded in 1961. Throughout his successful \ncareer, Carl was the best, most loyal fan of the University of Virginia \nCavaliers, and his generosity to his beloved alma mater and all those \nin his life was boundless. He donated millions of dollars to advance \nVirginia's academic, athletic and arts programs, and to support the \nconstruction and preservation of its facilities. He also served on the \nBoard of Visitors for 8 years. Carl was known for his business savvy \nbut also for his loyalty, his kindness and his sense of humor.\n  Susan and I grieve with Carl's dear wife Hunter and their family over \nthis heart-aching loss. May God continue to bless Virginia and America \nwith people of Carl W. Smith's unflinching character.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/16/senate-section/article/S13778-2", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13778]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           REMEMBERING CLIFFORD BROWN AND LARUE BROWN WATSON\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, October 30, 2005, marked the 75th \nbirthday of Clifford Benjamin Brown, one of this Nation's great jazz \nmusicians. Born into a large, middle-class, African-American family in \nWilmington, DE, Clifford Brown was the youngest of eight children and \ninherited his love and passion for music from his father, Joe Brown. He \nbegan to show interest in the trumpet at a young age, and by the time \nhe turned 12, he was engaged in private lessons. He attended Howard \nHigh School in Wilmington, where he was encouraged to play music by \near. He studied math at the University of Delaware and music at \nMaryland State College.\n  His career as a jazz trumpeter was monumental. He performed alongside \nsuch music legends as Miles Davis and Fats Navarro, while combining his \nsounds and style with those of Art Farmer, Dizzy Gillespie and Dinah \nWashington. Clifford played in Chris Powell's Blue Flames Band and the \nBrown-Roach Quintet. Sadly, Clifford Brown's promising and \nextraordinary career was tragically cut short when a car accident took \nhis life on June 26, 1956. He was only 25 years old.\n  But the legacy of Clifford Brown extended far beyond his years \nthrough the efforts of his wife LaRue, whom he had married in 1954. \nLaRue helped to launch the Los Angeles Jazz Heritage Foundation's \nprogram which served underprivileged children, and founded the Clifford \nBrown Jazz Foundation.\n  LaRue Brown Watson passed away on Sunday, October 2, 2005 at the age \nof 72. She is survived by her children, Clifford Brown, Jr., Adrienne \nTraywick and Brian Watson, her son-in-law Clarence Traywick, and many \ngrandchildren, cousins, nieces, nephews and friends.\n  Today, I stand and lead the Senate in paying tribute to the life of \nthe great Clifford Brown and in lamenting the passing of his widow, \nLaRue Brown Watson.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/16/senate-section/article/S13778-3", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13778-S13779]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO SERGEANT MAJOR FRANK YOAKUM\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise to honor SGM Frank Yoakum, who \nserves as the enlisted congressional, liaison for the Chief, National \nGuard Bureau. Sergeant Major Yoakum is the only enlisted legislative \nliaison in the Army, facilitating communication flow between the Army \nNational Guard, National Guard Bureau, and elected officials on Capitol \nHill, as well as their staffs and professional committee staff. He is \non the personal staff of the Chief, National Guard Bureau.\n\n[[Page S13779]]\n\n  He began his military career by enlisting in the Regular Army in \nSeptember 1971. He was trained in Infantry, Airborne, and Air Defense \nArtillery assignments, being released from Active Duty in July 1976. In \nJune 1978, Sergeant Major Yoakum joined the Alaska Army National Guard \nand served in a military technician status as the administrative \nassistant to the state maintenance officer, and part-time as a flight \noperations coordinator with the 1898th Aviation Company, Attack. He \nmoved to southeast Alaska and continued his service as a full-time \nScout Battalion Attendant, Administrative Supply Technician, for \nCompany B, 4th Battalion, 297th Infantry. He served in the Alaska Army \nNational Guard until March 1981.\n  In August 1983, he rejoined the Army National Guard in Phoenix AZ, \nworking as a unit administrator and battalion supply sergeant. In \nOctober 1985, he entered Federal Active Guard Reserve status and was \nassigned to the United States Property and Fiscal Office Guam, where he \nserved as military pay supervisor and logistics NCO. He transferred his \nmembership from the Arizona Army National Guard to the Wyoming Army \nNational Guard in March 1996. Further assignments in Federal AGR status \nincluded instructor/writer, operations NCO, force structure NCO, first \nsergeant, manpower NCO, training center liaison NCO, G-1 personnel \npolicy sergeant major, and congressional liaison.\n  Sergeant Major Yoakum holds an associate of arts degree in business \nadministration from the University of Alaska and a bachelor of science \ndegree in business administration from California Pacific University. \nHe is a graduate of every level of NCO education up to and including \nthe Sergeants Major Academy. Yoakum is a life member of the Enlisted \nAssociation of the National Guard of the United States and a life \nmember of the Wyoming National Guard Association. He has been inducted \ninto the Honorable Order of Saint Barbara by the Field Artillery \nAssociation and the Order of Samuel Sharpe by the Ordnance Corps \nAssociation.\n  As the former congressional liaison for the Chief, National Guard \nBureau, my staff and I have found Sergeant Major Yoakum to be an \ninvaluable resource and ally in advancing the interest of the Army \nNational Guard. While his departure will be a major loss to the both \nNGB and the Federal Government, his new position as legislative \ndirector with the Enlisted Association of the National Guard of the \nU.S. is well deserved. It is with admiration that I honor Sergeant \nMajor Yoakum today and congratulate him on his retirement.

Mr. President, I rise to memorialize in the \nRecord of the Senate, one of the great institutions in the State of \nGeorgia. This year, Saint Joseph's Hospital celebrates its 125th \nanniversary of providing the citizens of Atlanta and the Southeast with \nthe highest quality and most compassionate health care services.\n  Let me speak for a moment on the significance of Saint Joseph's:\n  In 1880, 125 years ago, shortly after the Civil War, four young \ndetermined Sisters of Mercy traveled to Atlanta from Savannah with a \nmeager 50 cents in their collective pockets to start a hospital. \nHospitals were not common during this time. The Sisters' idea of \ncreating a hospital that would serve the entire community, and not \nsimply be a place to die, was truly bold and visionary.\n  With the goal of ``extending the mission of healing mercy begun by \nChrist, showing a just and compassionate regard for all who suffer,'' \nSaint Joseph's Infirmary was established as a 10-bed hospital in an old \nhouse located on Courtland and Baker Streets in downtown Atlanta.\n  Saint Joseph's established Georgia's first school of nursing in 1900, \nan indigent ward to care for the poor and rural population during the \ndepression, diagnostic outpatient clinics, and a $10,000 operating room \nto begin a legacy of state-of-the-art medical technology.\n  The hospital became a national leader in treating heart disease, \nperforming the first openheart surgery in the Southeast, the first \nangioplasty as an alternative to bypass surgery, and operated the first \ncomprehensive cardiac catheterization laboratory. And, Saint Joseph's \nbecame one of only six medical centers in the world to perform \npercutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty.\n  In 1978, the hospital moved to north Atlanta in order to continue its \ngrowing mission of service and changed the name to Saint Joseph's \nHospital. To maintain close ties with those it served downtown, Saint \nJoseph's Mercy Care Services began. Starting as a simple signup sheet \nfor volunteers to visit women's and homeless shelters, teams used their \nown vehicles and worked out of tackle boxes filled with medical \nsupplies donated by physician offices. Today, Saint Joseph's Mercy Care \nServices is truly an integral part of the community. They now provide \ncomprehensive services to the chronically homeless of Atlanta.\n  In 2003, the hospital formed the Saint Joseph's Research Institute, a \ncomprehensive research center to provide patients access to some of the \nnewest and most innovative therapies available in the world. The \nResearch Institute provides preclinical research and trials and \nclinical trials in cardiology, pulmonology, radiation, oncology, \ngastroenterology, orthopaedics and more.\n  Saint Joseph's is among only 10 nonteaching hospitals in the country \nto have earned the Distinguished Hospital Award for Clinical Excellence \nand Patient Safety by HealthGrades, Inc., the Nations' leading provider \nof health care quality information. It is also among a prestigious \ngroup of hospitals on Solucients 100 Top Hospitals for Cardiovascular \ncare--Saint Joseph's has been named a 100 Top Hospital 5 times. J.D. \nPower and Associates also has recognized Saint Joseph's as a \nDistinguished Hospital for Service Excellence, providing an outstanding \npatient experience, for 2 consecutive year, the first hospital in \nAtlanta to earn the distinction.\n  But it is the people behind the awards and recognitions that make \nSaint Joseph's so unique. From the Sisters of Mercy who still are \nintimately involved with the hospital to the nurses, physicians and \nmedical support staff--the spirit of mercy is alive and vibrant. That \nspirit transcends the entire organization and is the foundation for the \nsuperior medical services and programs, the unique compassionate care, \nthe volunteers who raise money for the homeless and underserved, and \nthe auxiliary who put in tireless hours at the hospital without pay. \nThe spirit of mercy is in all employees who come to work year after \nyear with smiles on their faces and compassion in their hearts.\n  It gives me great pleasure to recognize on the Senate floor the \ncontributions of Saint Joseph's Hospital to the citizens of Atlanta, \nGA, and the Southeast.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/16/senate-section/article/S13779-2", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13779-S13780]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING CHARLES R. ADAMS\n\n Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment and \nhonor a man who has greatly served his community and his Nation for \nmore than 38 years.\n  Charles R. Adams retired from his position of National Employee \nDevelopment Center Director for the U.S. Department of Agriculture's \nNatural Resources Conservation Service, NRCS, in Fort Worth, TX, on \nNovember 3, 2005.\n  Charles learned the importance of self-development at an early age \nwhile growing up on his family farm in Logansport, LA. His parents, the \nlate Mr. T.C. Adams and Elneva Adams, gave him and his 10 siblings \nfirsthand experience in working the land, and he still carries those \nexperiences with him today.\n  After leaving Logansport, Charles graduated from Southern University \nat Baton Rouge with a bachelor of science in agronomy. He received his \nmaster's degree in public administration from Harvard University in \nCambridge, MA, in 1983 and has Ph.D. studies in urban and public \naffairs at the University of Texas in Arlington.\n  His impressive career with USDA spans some 38 years, having held some \nof the top positions in his Agency, including regional conservationist \nfor the NRCS Southeast Region, based in Atlanta, GA, from 1997 to 2004, \ndirector of the National Employee Development\n\n[[Page S13780]]\n\nCenter, based in Fort Worth, TX, from 1993 to 1997, South National \nTechnical Center associate director, also based in Fort Worth, from \n1992 to 1993, and water quality coordinator at the center from 1990 to \n1992.\n  Before that Charles served as NRCS's State Conservationist for \nArizona, based in Phoenix, from 1988 to 1990, after having been the \nState Conservationist for Nevada, based in Reno, from 1986 to 1988. He \nwas the Deputy State Conservationist in New Mexico, based in \nAlbuquerque, from 1985 to 1986, after having been the Assistant State \nConservationist for Operations at that location from 1984 to 1985.\n  Charles worked as an area conservationist in Rio Rancho, NM, from \n1983 to 1984, after working as an area conservationist in Flagstaff, \nAZ, from 1981 to 1982. From 1978 to 1981 he served as a district \nconservationist in Edinburg, TX, following service from 1976 to 1978 as \na district conservationist in Eastland, TX. He was a soil \nconservationist for the agency in Abilene, TX, from 1973 to 1976. He \nbegan his full-time career with the agency as a soil scientist in \nAthens, TX, in 1969.\n  During his tenure with USDA, Charles founded some of the Agency's \nmost innovative approaches to outreach, including the Student Trainees \nin Agriculture Related Sciences, STARS, program, an initiative to \nintroduce underserved high school students in the Southeast to \nagriculture, as well as NRCS's American Indian Program Delivery \nInitiative, an annual conference linking USDA officials with American \nIndian leaders to promote tribal participation in USDA programs and \nservices.\n  While working for NRCS, Charles Adams has received a number of awards \nand recognitions.

ISAAC GREGGS\n\n Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment and \nhonor a man who has influenced the lives of so many students for more \nthan 35 years.\n  A band director since 1969, Dr. Isaac Greggs has taken the half time \nshow for Southern University to a different level, electrifying \naudiences with the band's energetic and precise performances. However, \nthese performances could not have happened without a lot of hard work. \nDr. Greggs' practices are legendary for being gruelling, but they paid \noff in the end.\n  In many ways, Dr. Greggs' practices are a metaphor for his life--when \none demonstrates discipline and effort, one can succeed anywhere.\n  This motto certainly proved true for Dr. Greggs' band. Under his \ndirection, the band performed around the world, including for three \nUnited States Presidential inaugurations, four Sugar Bowls, and five \nSuper Bowls. The band has also appeared at the Astro Dome, Superdome, \nYankee Stadium, and the Oakland Stadium Coliseum. For six weeks, the \nband played at Radio City Music Hall, and they have also made \nappearances on television shows such as the Bob Hope Show, Jim Nabors \nShow, Almost Anything Goes Show, Perry Como Show, Henry, The Fonz, \nWinkler Show, and the Telly Savalas Show.\n  In addition to the talent Dr. Greggs has brought as a band leader, he \nis also an accomplished musician and song writer and is the author of \nSouthern University's fight song and alma mater. He is an honorary \nmember of both Louisiana's House of Representatives and State Senate, \nand has won several major music festival awards for the marching \ndivision. Dr. Greggs has conducted honor bands throughout the country, \nand on behalf of Southern University he was presented with a special \ntrophy by the National Football League for his band's outstanding \nperformance at a Super Bowl.\n  Dr. Greggs' leadership is not limited to the sporting field. As \npresident of the Louisiana College Band Directors Association, founder \nand president of the Lakeside Music Mart and School of Music, and State \nChairman of the L.I.A.L.O. Band Festival, Dr. Greggs has proved his \nleadership skills and shown his commitment to the arts.\n  Dr. Greggs was presented with the Key of Life Award at the 31st NAACP \nImage Awards. The Key of Life Award was created in honor of musician \nStevie Wonder and is presented to an individual or group who \nexemplifies Wonder's ``inner vision.'' The award also recognizes \nextraordinary achievements in the areas of civil rights, human rights, \nand community. It is clear through all of his career, Dr. Greggs \nexemplified these attributes.\n  Dr. Greggs' power to move people through music is an amazing gift. If \none is lucky in life, one improves the life of one's own children. \nHowever, Dr. Greggs has improved the lives of thousands and has left an \nindelible mark on African-American students and fans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/16/senate-section/article/S13780-2", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13780]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/16/senate-section/article/S13780-3", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13780]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/16/senate-section/article/S13780-4", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13780-S13781]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREPORT OF GUIDELINES AND REQUIREMENTS RELATIVE TO IMPLEMENTATION OF THE \n   INFORMATION SHARING ENVIRONMENT CALLED FOR BY SECTION 1016 OF THE \n    INTELLIGENCE REFORM AND TERRORISM PREVENTION ACT OF 2004--PM 34\n\n  The Presiding Officer laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Select Committee on Intelligence:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States\n  The robust and effective sharing of terrorism information is vital to \nprotecting Americans and the Homeland from terrorist attacks. To ensure \nthat we succeed in this mission, my Administration is working to \nimplement the Information Sharing Environment (ISE) called for by \nsection 1016 of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of \n2004 (IRTPA). The ISE is intended to enable the Federal Government and \nour State, local, tribal, and private sector partners to share \nappropriate information relating to terrorists, their threats, plans, \nnetworks, supporters, and capabilities while, at the same time, \nrespecting the information privacy and other legal rights of all \nAmericans.\n  Today, I issued a set of guidelines and requirements that represent a \nsignificant step in the establishment of the ISE. These guidelines and \nrequirements, which are consistent with the provisions of section \n1016(d) of IRTPA, are set forth in a memorandum to the heads of \nexecutive departments and agencies. The guidelines and requirements \nalso address collateral issues that are essential to any meaningful \nprogress on information sharing. In sum, these guidelines will:\n  Clarify roles and authorities across executive departments and \nagencies;\n  Implement common standards and architectures to further facilitate \ntimely and effective information sharing;\n  Improve the Federal Government's terrorism information sharing \nrelationships with State, local, and tribal governments, the private \nsector, and foreign allies;\n\n[[Page S13781]]\n\n  Revamp antiquated classification and marking systems, as they relate \nto sensitive but unclassified information;\n  Ensure that information privacy and other legal rights of Americans \nare protected in the development and implementation of the ISE; and\n  Ensure that departments and agencies promote a culture of information \nsharing by assigning personnel and dedicating resources to terrorism \ninformation sharing.\n  The guidelines build on the strong commitment that my Administration \nand the Congress have already made to strengthening information \nsharing, as evidenced by Executive Orders 13311 of July 27, 2003, and \n13388 of October 25, 2005, section 892 of the Homeland Security Act of \n2002, the USA PATRIOT Act, and sections 1011 and 1016 of the IRTPA. \nWhile much work has been done by executive departments and agencies, \nmore is required to fully develop and implement the ISE.\n  To lead this national effort, I designated the Program Manager (PM) \nresponsible for information sharing across the Federal Government, and \ndirected that the PM and his office be part of the Office of the \nDirector of National Intelligence (DNI), and that the DNI exercise \nauthority, direction, and control over the PM and ensure that the PM \ncarries out his responsibilities under section 1016 of IRTPA. I fully \nsupport the efforts of the PM and the Information Sharing Council to \ntransform our current capabilities into the desired ISE, and I have \ndirected all heads of executive departments and agencies to support the \nPM and the DNI to meet our stated objectives.\n  Creating the ISE is a difficult and complex task that will require a \nsustained effort and strong partnership with the Congress. I know that \nyou share my commitment to achieve the goal of providing decision \nmakers and the men and women on the front lines in the War on Terror \nwith the best possible information to protect our Nation. I appreciate \nyour support to date and look forward to working with you in the months \nahead on this critical initiative.\n                                                      George W.

A bill to reauthorize the Temporary Assistance for Needy \nFamilies block grant program through June 30, 2006, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am here to introduce bill to provide a \n6-month extension of the Nation's largely successful welfare program. \nIt is known as the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Program, or \nTANF.\n  Congress enacted the TANF program in 1996, to help welfare recipients \ngain work skills and to help low-income families become economically \nself-sufficient.\n  Welfare reform has mostly succeeded. States have adopted creative \npolicies to support low-income families making the transition from \nwelfare to work. Millions have moved to self-sufficiency.\n  But the TANF law expired in 2002. And Congress has failed to \nreauthorize it. Instead, Congress has extended TANF on a short-term \nbasis, 12 times. The latest short-term extension expires in just over 2 \nweeks.\n  This bill is a simple extension of the current welfare program. It \nwould provide stability for the States to operate their welfare \nprograms. And it would continue our successful partnership with the \nStates in supporting needy families as they move from welfare to work.\n  Earlier this week, the Senate voted 64-27 to keep the welfare program \nout of the budget cutting reconciliation bill that the House has \npassed. The Senate voted instead to build on the bipartisan Finance \nCommittee bill that Chairman Grassley and I worked diligently on this \nyear. That bill is called the Personal Responsibility Individual \nDevelopment for Everyone or PRIDE Act. The Finance Committee reported \nit out in March with near unanimous support. The PRIDE Act has been \nawaiting full Senate consideration since then.\n  Despite broad support in the Finance Committee, the Senate has not \ntaken this measure up for debate. Despite the broad support of \ngovernors, the Senate has not taken this measure up for debate. The \nRepublican Governors Association said that TANF reauthorization ``is \ntoo important to leave to the limitations of the reconciliation \nprocess.'' But the Senate has not taken this measure up for debate.\n  This vote was a vote to debate this bill on the Senate floor. It was \na vote to build on the broadly-supported bill from the Finance \nCommittee. We are going to need some time to complete that debate.\n  The 6-month extension that I offer this afternoon will keep the \nwelfare program operating. The 6-month extension will allow us the time \nto debate, pass, and go to conference on a fully considered PRIDE Act.\n  I urge my colleagues to do the responsible thing. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this extension. I urge my colleagues to keep this \nimportant safety net program operating.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. OBAMA (for himself, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Durbin, and Mr. \n        DeWine):\n  S. 2125. A bill to promote relief, security, and democracy in the \nDemocratic Republic of the Congo; to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise today, on behalf of Senator \nBrownback, Senator Durbin, and Senator DeWine to introduce the \nDemocratic Republic of the Congo Relief, Security and Democracy \nPromotion Act.\n  As we try to conclude our business for the year here in the Senate, \nwe are in the midst of sharp debates on a large number of issues. In \nthe foreign policy arena alone, the Administration and Congress are \nconsumed with nurturing a political process and defeating insurgents in \nIraq, attempting to halt proliferation by Iran and North Korea, and \ntrying to end the bloodshed in Darfur, Sudan.\n  But there is another country embroiled in conflict that has not yet \nreceived the high-level attention or resources it needs. It's the \nDemocratic Republic of Congo, and right now it is in the midst of a \nhumanitarian catastrophe.\n  An International Rescue Committee report from 2004 found that 31,000 \npeople were dying in the Congo each month and 3.8 million--3.8 \nmillion--people had died in the previous 6 years. This means that this \nconflict, which still smolders and burns in some regions, has cost more \nlives than any other conflict since World War II.\n  Beyond the humanitarian catastrophe, resolving the problems in the \nCongo will be critical if Africa is to achieve its promise. The \ncountry, which is the size of Western Europe, lies at the geographic \nheart of Africa and borders every major region across the continent. If \nleft untended, Congo's tragedy will continue to infect Africa--from \nNorth to South; from East to West.\n  I believe that the United States can make a profound difference in \nthis crisis. According to international aid agencies, there are \ninnumerable cost-effective interventions that could be quickly \nundertaken--such as the provision of basic medical care, immunization \nand clean water--that could save thousands of lives. On the political \nfront, sustained U.S. leadership could fill a perilous vacuum.\n  The bill that we are introducing here today is an important step on \nthe long road towards bringing peace and prosperity to the Congo. I am \nproud to be a part of a collaborative, bipartisan effort with some of \nthe Senate's leading voices on Africa--Senators Brownback, Durbin and \nDeWine.\n  This bill establishes 14 core principles of U.S. policy across a \nrange of issues; authorizes a 25 percent increase in U.S. assistance \nfor the Democratic Republic of the Congo; calls for a Special Envoy to \nresolve the situation in Eastern Congo; and urges the Administration to \nuse its voice and vote at the\n\n[[Page S13789]]\n\nUnited Nations Security Council to strengthen the U.N. peacekeeping \nforce that is providing security in parts of the Congo.\n  The legislation has been endorsed by a number of faith-based and \nhumanitarian nongovernmental organizations, including some with \nextensive field operations in Congo: CARE, Catholic Relief Services, \nGlobal Witness, International Crisis Group, International Rescue \nCommittee, and Oxfam America. I ask unanimous consent that these \nletters of support be printed in the Record.\n  I want to stress something before closing. We are under no illusion \nthat enacting the policies in this bill would be a panacea for Congo's \nmany ills. But the one thing we do know is that the one way to ensure \nthat a complex problem will not be resolved is to accept the status \nquo.\n  The other thing we know is that status quo in the Democratic Republic \nof Congo is unacceptable--unacceptable to the women and children caught \nup in the crossfire, unacceptable to the civilians being felled by \npreventable disease, unacceptable to a continent that is making great \nstrides, and unacceptable to our country, the United States, which has \nthe financial and diplomatic resources to make a profound difference.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues and the administration \nto enacting this bill and working to promote peace and prosperity in \nthe Congo.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     Catholic Relief Services,\n\n                                  Baltimore, MD, December 2, 2005.\n     Hon. Barack Obama,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Obama: Catholic Relief Services would like to \n     commend you for your leadership in writing in ``Democratic \n     Republic of the Congo Relief, Security, and Democracy \n     Promotion Act of 2005''. We also want to sincerely thank you \n     and your staff for giving us the opportunity to comment on an \n     early draft of the bill and for incorporating some of our \n     recommendations.\n       As an agency active on the ground in the Democratic \n     Republic of the Congo (DRC) for many years, we support this \n     legislation as a vehicle for elevating the priority of the \n     DRC among lawmakers and policy makers. The bill advances key \n     U.S. policy objectives for promoting peace, justice, \n     democracy, and development in the DRC, and also allocates \n     much-needed additional funds for the DRC.\n       We look forward to working with you and your staff to gain \n     support for the bill and advance its goals.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Ken Hackett,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 December 9, 2005.\n     Hon. Barack Obama,\n     Senate Hart Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Obama: As representatives of humanitarian, \n     civil society and conflict prevention organizations, we are \n     writing to express our support for the Democratic Republic of \n     the Congo Relief, Security, and Democracy Promotion Act of \n     2005, and our appreciation of your efforts to ensure that the \n     longstanding conflict in the region receives the attention it \n     demands.\n       As stated in the legislation, the conflict in the eastern \n     Democratic Republic of the Congo touches every major region \n     of the continent and is one of the deadliest since World War \n     II. Some 3.8 million people have lost their lives due to the \n     conflict in the last six years.\n       Despite these troubling statistics, the DRC is not without \n     hope. Landmark elections are planned for next year and, with \n     strong support from the international community, they have \n     the potential to help end the longstanding violence and put \n     the country on the path toward peace and stability. Your \n     legislation would ensure the active participation of the \n     United States and authorizes critical funding to address \n     humanitarian and development needs, promote good governance \n     and rule of law, and help ensure transparent management of \n     natural resource revenues.\n       We look forward to continuing work with you and your staff \n     on this important issue and in particular, would like to note \n     the effort Mr. Mark Lippert has made to reach out to our \n     community and incorporate our recommendations.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                     CARE USA,\n\n                              Global Witness, International Rescue\n     Committee, Oxfam America.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   International Crisis Group,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, December 8, 2005.\n     Senator Barack Obama,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington DC.\n       Dear Senator Obama: The International Crisis Group strongly \n     supports the Democratic Republic of Congo Relief, Security, \n     and Democracy Promotion Act of 2005 and your efforts to raise \n     the visibility of and define new policies to respond to this \n     largely overlooked, longstanding, and deadly conflict.\n       The conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo has had \n     far reaching regional consequences and resulted in the loss \n     of an estimated 4 million lives since 1998. The situation in \n     the country, especially in the eastern region where armed \n     groups continue to assault local communities, remains most \n     precarious and in need of urgent action.\n       The country is now on the brink of landmark elections \n     scheduled for next year. Crisis Group has advocated \n     comprehensive action to stop the suffering of the Congolese \n     people and ensure the success of the transition by June 2006.\n       Your legislation would ensure the active participation of \n     the United States in this effort and help in promoting good \n     governance and justice. It would further authorize critical \n     funding to address development needs and provide life-saving \n     humanitarian assistance to millions of conflict-affected \n     civilians in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n       Your leadership in introducing this legislation is greatly \n     appreciated and we look forward to continue to work with you \n     and your staff on this important issue.\n           Yours sincerely,\n\n                                            Mark L. Schneider,\n\n                              Senior Vice President, International\n                                                     Crisis Group.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. CLINTON (for herself, Mr. Lieberman, and Mr. Bayh):\n  S. 2126. A bill to limit the exposure of children to violent video \ngames; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to help \nparents protect their children against violent and sexual media. In \nrising, I stand with the parents and children of New York and of the \nNation, all of whom are being victimized by a culture of violence.\n  As parents, we monitor the kind of people who interact with our \nchildren. We attend parent night at school. We meet our children's \nteachers. We look over their textbooks to make sure they are installing \nour values and attitudes in our children. We meet our children's \nfriends and their parents to make sure they are a positive source of \ninfluence.\n  If somebody is exposing our children to material we find \ninappropriate, we remove our children from that person.\n  If you hired a babysitter who exposed your children to violence and \nsexual material that you thought was inappropriate, what would you do? \nIf you are like me, you would fire that babysitter and never invite him \nor her to come back.\n  Yet our children spend more time consuming media than doing anything \nelse but sleeping and attending school. Media culture is like having a \nstranger in your house, and it exerts a major influence over your \nchildren.\n  It is this attack on the sensibilities of our children that is the \nsubject of the bill I introduce today. It is a bill that I consider to \nbe of tremendous importance to our families.\n  This bill would take an important step towards helping parents \nprotect their children against influences they often find to be \ninappropriate--violent and sexually explicit video games. Quite simply, \nthe bill would put teeth into the video game industry's rating system, \nwhich specifies which video games are inappropriate for young people \nunder 17. By fining retailers who do not abide by the ratings system, \nthis bill sends a message that the ratings system is to be taken \nseriously.\n  I know many of my colleagues, myself included, don't play video games \nand aren't aware of exactly what is contained in these games. So, I \nhope you will listen as I describe a few scenes so we know what is at \nissue here today.\n  Consider the following scenario: You have been captured by a demented \nfilm-maker who drops you into a gang-infested slum. While the gangs \nthink they are hunting you, they don't know the real plot: that you are \nhunting them, while the director records each act of murder on film. \nSince you are outnumbered and could easily be mobbed, you cannot just \njump in and fight everyone. Rather, you must be silent and patient, \ntracking your prey so that you can strike from behind. You strangle a \nvillain with a sharp wire, and a finely rendered mist of blood sprays \nfrom his severed carotid artery. . . .\n  This is just one scene from one game. It happens not to be a game \nthat has gotten a tremendous amount of attention lately. Frankly, I \ndon't know if it's one of the most popular games out\n\n[[Page S13790]]\n\nthere or not. But I do know, if my daughter was still young, I wouldn't \nwant her playing it.\n  Here is another one: Carl Johnson long ago escaped the hardships of \nstreet life in San Andreas. Now his mother is murdered, his old buddies \nare in trouble, and Carl must come home to clean up the mess--San \nAndreas style. That means spraying people with uzi bullets, blowing \nthem up, or sniper shooting them from the top of buildings. It also \nmeans killing police officers and visiting prostitutes.\n  No one doubts that this material is inappropriate for children. The \nvideo game industry itself developed and implemented the ratings system \nthat parents rely on today. They are responsible for developing the \n``M'' for Mature or ``AO'' for Adults Only labels, which signal to \nparents that the content is too violent and/or sexually explicit for a \nchild to play.\n  Unfortunately, enforcement has been lax and minors can purchase \nMature-rated games with relative ease. A 2001 study by the Federal \nTrade Commission showed that 85 percent of unaccompanied minors, ages \n13 to 16, could purchase games rated Mature. A study by the National \nInstitute on Media and the Family found that nearly half of children, \nas young as age 9, succeed in buying Mature-rated games. And close to a \nquarter of retailers did not understand the ratings system and half did \nnot provide any training to their employees.\n  This is a terrible problem that needs to be fixed. And this bill does \njust that.\n  I want to be clear--this bill is not an attack on video games. Video \ngames are a fun part of the lives of millions of Americans, young and \nold alike. They can teach coordination and strategy. They can introduce \nchildren to computer technology. They can provide practice in learning \nto problem solve and they can help children hone their fine motor and \nspatial skills.\n  This bill is also not an attack on free and creative expression. \nRelying on the growing body of scientific evidence that demonstrates a \ncausal link between exposure to these games and antisocial behavior in \nour children, this bill was carefully drafted to pass constitutional \nstrict scrutiny.\n  Furthermore, nothing in this bill limits the production or sale of \nthese games beyond current practice. If retailers are following the \nrules--established voluntarily by the video game industry--then this \nbill will have absolutely no impact on them.\n  And this bill does not overlook or undervalue the critical role \nparents play in protecting their children, and instilling in them, \ntheir own values. This bill is designed to buoy the efforts of parents, \nwho too often feel like they are fighting an uphill battle against the \nviolent and sexually explicit messages that are just a trip to the mall \naway.\n  The unfortunate truth is there is a darkside to some video games, \nwhich has lead to a universal agreement--among parents, advocates, \npolicymakers, and the gaming industry--that some games are not suitable \nfor children. What we are seeking to do today is to ensure that that \nvalue judgment is meaningful.\n  Much of the public concern about the exposure of children to M-rated \ngames focuses on sexually explicit content. Parents are rightly worried \nabout this content and we should come together to take steps to keep \nthese games out of the hands of our kids. But let's not discount the \nawful effect of violence in the media because, frankly, the evidence on \nthis point is overwhelming and deserves more of our attention.\n  Consider the Joint Statement on the Impact of Entertainment Violence \non Children from the Congressional Public Health Summit in July of \n2000. I quote: ``Well over 1,000 studies--including reports from the \nSurgeon General's office, the National Institute of Mental Health, and \nnumerous studies conducted by leading figures within our medical and \npublic health organizations . . . point overwhelmingly to a causal \nconnection between media violence and aggressive behavior in some \nchildren,'' states their report.\n  The American Academy of Pediatrics stated, in a report entitled Media \nExposure Feeding Children's Violent Acts, ``Playing violent video games \nis to an adolescent's violent behavior what smoking tobacco is to lung \ncancer.'' I ask to have printed in the Record a resolution adopted by \nthe American Psychological Association about the effect of violence in \nvideo games and interactive media.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      Resolution on Violence in Video Games and Interactive Media\n\n       Whereas, decades of social science research reveals the \n     strong influence of televised violence on the aggressive \n     behavior of children and youth (APA Task Force On Television \n     and Society; 1992 Surgeon General's Scientific Advisory \n     Committee on Television and Social Behavior, 1972); and\n       Whereas, psychological research reveals that the electronic \n     media play an important role in the development of attitude, \n     emotion, social behavior and intellectual functioning of \n     children and youth (APA Task Force On Television and Society, \n     1992; Funk, J. B., et al. 2002; Singer, D. G. & Singer, J. L. \n     2005; Singer, D. G. & Singer, J. L. 2001); and\n       Whereas, there appears to be evidence that exposure to \n     violent media increases feelings of hostility, thoughts about \n     aggression, suspicions about the motives of others, and \n     demonstrates violence as a method to deal with potential \n     conflict situations (Anderson, C.A., 2000; Anderson, C.A., \n     Carnagey, N.

Only 16% of all programs \n     portrayed negative psychological or financial effects, yet \n     such visual depictions of pain and suffering can actually \n     inhibit aggressive behavior in viewers (National Television \n     Violence Study, 1996); and\n       Whereas, comprehensive analysis of violent interactive \n     video game research suggests such exposure a.) increases \n     aggressive behavior, b.) increases aggressive thoughts, c.) \n     increases angry feelings, d.) decreases helpful behavior, \n     and, e.) increases physiological arousal (Anderson, C.A., \n     2002b; Anderson, C.A., Carnagey, N. L., Flanagan, M., \n     Benjamin, A. J., Eubanks, J., Valentine, J. C., 2004; \n     Anderson, C.A., & Dill, K. E., 2000; Bushman, B.J., & \n     Anderson, C.A., 2002; Gentile, D. A, Lynch, P. J., Linder, J. \n     R., & Walsh, D. A., 2004); and\n       Whereas, studies further suggest that sexualized violence \n     in the media has been linked to increases in violence towards \n     women, rape myth acceptance and anti-women attitudes. \n     Research on interactive video games suggests that the most \n     popular video games contain aggressive and violent content; \n     depict women and girls, men and boys, and minorities in \n     exaggerated stereotypical ways; and reward, glamorize and \n     depict as humorous sexualized aggression against women, \n     including assault, rape and murder (Dietz, T. L., 1998; Dill, \n     K. E., & Dill, J. C., 2004; Dill, K. E., Gentile, D. A, \n     Richter, W. A., & Dill, J.C., in press; Mulac, A., Jansma, L. \n     L., & Linz, D. G., 2002; Walsh, D., Gentile, D. A., \n     VanOverbeke, M., & Chasco, E., 2002); and\n       Whereas, the characteristics of violence in interactive \n     video games appear to have similar detrimental effects as \n     viewing television violence; however based upon learning \n     theory (Bandura, 1977; Berkowitz, 1993), the practice, \n     repetition, and rewards for acts of violence may be more \n     conducive to increasing aggressive behavior among children \n     and youth than passively watching violence on TV and in films \n     (Carll, E. K., 1999a). With the development of more \n     sophisticated interactive media, such as virtual reality, the \n     implications for violent content are of further concern, due \n     to the intensification of more realistic experiences, and may \n     also be more conducive to increasing aggressive behavior than \n     passively watching violence on TV and in films (Calvert, S. \n     L., Jordan, A. B., Cocking, R. R. (Ed.) 2002; Carll, E. K., \n     2003; Turkle, S., 2002); and\n       Whereas, studies further suggest that videogames influence \n     the learning processes in many ways more than in passively \n     observing TV: a.) requiring identification of the participant \n     with a violent character while playing video games, b.) \n     actively participating increases learning, c.) rehearsing \n     entire behavioral sequences rather than only a part of the \n     sequence, facilitates learning, and d.) repetition increases \n     learning (Anderson, C.A., 2002b; Anderson, C.A., Carnagey, N. \n     L., Flanagan, M., Benjamin, A. J., Eubanks, J., Valentine, J. \n     C., 2004; Anderson, C.A. & Dill, K. E., 2000); and\n       Whereas the data dealing with media literacy curricula \n     demonstrate that when children are taught how to view \n     television critically, there is a reduction of TV viewing in \n     general, and a clearer understanding of the messages conveyed \n     by the medium. Studies on media literacy demonstrate when \n     children are taught how to view television critically, \n     children can feel less frightened and sad after discussions \n     about the medium, can learn to differentiate between fantasy \n     and reality, and can identify less with aggressive \n     characters. on TV, and better understand commercial messages \n     (Brown, 2001; Hobbs, R. & Frost, R., 2003; Hortin, J.A., \n     1982; Komaya, M., 2003; Rosenkoetter, L.J., Rosenkoetter, \n     S.E., Ozretich, R.A., & Acock, A.C., 2004; Singer & Singer, \n     1998; Singer & Singer, 1994)\n       Therefore be it Resolved that APA advocate for the \n     reduction of all violence in\n\n[[Page S13791]]\n\n     videogames and interactive media marketed to children and \n     youth.\n       Be it further Resolved that APA publicize information about \n     research relating to violence in video games and interactive \n     media on children and youth in the Association's publications \n     and communications to the public.\n       Be it further Resolved that APA encourage academic, \n     developmental, family, and media psychologists to teach media \n     literacy that meets high standards of effectiveness to \n     children, teachers, parents and caregivers to promote ability \n     to critically evaluate interactive media and make more \n     informed choices.\n       Be it further Resolved that APA advocate for funding to \n     support basic and applied research, including special \n     attention to the role of social learning, sexism, negative \n     depiction of minorities, and gender on the effects of \n     violence in video games and interactive media on children, \n     adolescents, and young adults.\n       Be it further Resolved that APA engage those responsible \n     for developing violent video games and interactive media in \n     addressing the issue that playing violent video games may \n     increase aggressive thoughts and aggressive behaviors in \n     children, youth, and young adults and that these effects may \n     be greater than the well documented effects of exposure to \n     violent television and movies.\n       Be it further Resolved that APA recommend to the \n     entertainment industry that the depiction of the consequences \n     of violent behavior be associated with negative social \n     consequences.\n       Be it further Resolved that APA (a) advocate for the \n     development and dissemination of a content based rating \n     system that accurately reflects the content of video games \n     and interactive media, and (b) encourage the distribution and \n     use of the rating system by the industry, the public, \n     parents, caregivers and educational organizations.\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. In June, a groundbreaking study by researchers at the \nUniversity of Indiana School of Medicine, which was published in the \nJournal of Clinical Psychology, concluded that adolescents exposed to \nhigh levels of violent media were less able to control and to direct \ntheir thoughts and behavior, to stay focused on a task, to plan, to \nscreen out distractions, and to use experience to guide inhibitions.\n  A 2004 meta-analysis of over 35 research studies that included over \n4,000 participants, found similar results. It concluded that playing \nviolent video games significantly increases aggressive behavior, \nphysiological arousal and feelings of anger and hostility, and \nsignificantly decreases pro-social helping behavior.\n  And according to testimony by Craig Andersen before the Commerce \nCommittee in 2000, violent video games have been found to increase \nviolent adolescent behavior by 13 to 22 percent. Eighty-six percent of \nAfrican American females in the games are victims of violence. And, the \nmost common role for women in video games is prostitutes.\n  Research also demonstrates the opposite--reducing exposure to \nviolence reduces aggressive behavior. A 2001 study by Stanford \nUniversity School of Medicine found that reducing TV and video violence \nconsumption to under one hour per day reduces verbal aggression by 50 \npercent and physical aggression by 40 percent among 3rd and 4th grade \nchildren.\n  Now, if you don't find the scientists compelling, consider a child \nnamed Devon Thompson, who shot three police officers after being \nbrought in under suspicion of driving a stolen car. He grabbed one of \nthe officer's guns, shot three men and then jumped into a police car, a \nscene remarkably like one found in the game Grand Theft Auto. When \nThompson was apprehended he said ``Life is a video game. You've got to \ndie sometime.''\n  In the face of this mountain of scientific and anecdotal evidence, \nthe same company that developed Grand Theft Auto is coming out with a \nnew game called Bully. In Bully, the player is a student who beats up \nother students in school.\n  Again, I am not here to argue that these games shouldn't be developed \nor made available. But, I am here to ask, can't we as a society do \nbetter by our kids? Can't we give parents the tools to make sure they \nknow what may fall into the hands of their children?\n  That is what this bill is all about and I urge my colleagues to join \nme in supporting it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself and Mr. Burns):\n  S. 2128. A bill to provide greater transparency with respect to \nlobbying activities, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation to provide \ngreater transparency into the process of influencing our Government and \nensure greater accountability among public officials.\n  The legislation does a number of things. It provides for faster \nreporting and greater public access to reports filed by lobbyists and \ntheir employers under the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995.\n  It requires greater disclosure of the activities of lobbyists, \nincluding for the first time grassroots lobbying firms.\n  The bill also requires greater disclosure from both lobbyists and \nMembers and employees of Congress about travel that is arranged or \nfinanced by a lobbyist or his client.\n  To understand more thoroughly the actions lobbyists take to influence \nelected officials, the bill requires lobbying firms, lobbyists, and \ntheir political action committees to disclose their campaign \ncontributions to Federal candidates and officeholders, their political \naction committees and political party committees. It further mandates \ndisclosure of fundraisers hosted, cohosted, or otherwise sponsored by \nthese entities, and disclosure of contributions for other events \ninvolving legislative and executive branch officials.\n  To get behind anonymous coalitions and associations and discover who \nactually is seeking to influence Government, the bill requires \nregistrants to list as clients those entities that contribute $10,000 \nor more to a coalition or association. The bill expressly keeps intact, \nhowever, existing law governing the disclosure of the identities of \nmembers and donors to organizations designated as 501(c) groups under \nthe Internal Revenue Code.\n  To address the problem of the revolving door between Government and \nthe private sector, the bill lengthens the period during which senior \nmembers of the executive, Members of Congress, and senior congressional \nstaff are restricted from lobbying.\n  The bill also modifies the provision in current law that exempts from \nthe revolving door laws former employees who go to work for Indian \ntribes by applying these laws to those employees retained by tribes as \noutside lobbyists and agents.\n  To ensure compliance with congressional restrictions on accepting \ngifts, the bill requires registrants under the Lobbying Disclosure Act \nto report gifts worth $20 or more. I repeat that: The person who gives \nthe gift is now responsible for reporting a gift of $20 or more.\n  To accurately reflect the true value of benefits received, the bill \nalso requires Members of Congress and staff to pay the fair market \nvalue for travel on private planes and the value of sports and \nentertainment tickets and skyboxes at the cost of the highest priced \nticket in the arena. The legislation increases the penalty for \nviolating the reporting requirements, and it contains other provisions \non enforcement and oversight.\n  This bill is regrettably necessary. Over the past year and a half, \nthe Committee on Indian affairs has unearthed a story of excess and \nabuse by former lobbyists of a few Indian tribes. The story is alarming \nin its depth and breadth of potential wrongdoing. It has spanned across \nthe United States, sweeping up tribes throughout Indian country. It has \ntaken us from tribal reservations across America to luxury skyboxes in \ntown, from a sham international think tank in Rehoboth Beach, DE, to a \nsniper workshop in Israel and beyond. It involves tens of millions of \ndollars that we know about and likely more that we do not.\n  Much of what the committee learned was extraordinary. Yet much of \nwhat we uncovered in the investigation was, unfortunately, the ordinary \nway of doing business in this town.\n  The bill I am introducing today seeks to address business as usual in \nthe Nation's Capital. How these lobbyists sought to influence policy \nand opinionmakers is a case study in the ways lobbyists seek to curry \nfavor with legislators and their aides. For example, they sought to \ningratiate themselves with public servants with tickets to plush \nskyboxes at the MCI Center, FedEx Field, and Camden Yards for sports \nand entertainment events. They\n\n[[Page S13792]]\n\narranged extravagant getaways to tropical islands, the famed golfing \nlinks of St. Andrews and elsewhere. They regularly treated people to \nmeals and drinks. Fundraisers and contributions abounded. The bill \ncasts some disinfectant on those practices by simply requiring greater \ndisclosure. If there is nothing inherently wrong with such activities, \nthen there is no good reason to hide them from public scrutiny. The \nAmerican people deserve no less.\n  During its investigation, the committee also learned about \nunscrupulous tactics employed to lobby Members and to shape public \nopinion. We found a sham international think tank in Rehoboth Beach, \nDE, established in part to disguise the true identity of clients. We \nsaw phony Christian grassroots organizations consisting of a box of \ncell phones and a desk drawer.\n  I submit that in the great marketplace of ideas we call public \ndiscourse, truth is a premium that we cannot sacrifice. Through these \npractices, the lobbyists distorted the truth not only with false \nmessages but also with fake messengers.\n  I hope by having for the first time disclosure of grassroots \nactivities in the financial interests beyond misleading front groups \nthat such a fraud on Members and voters can be avoided. Many cast blame \nonly on the lobbying industry. But we should not forget that we as \nMembers owe it to the American people to conduct ourselves in a way \nthat reinforces rather than diminishes the public's faith and \nconfidence in Congress.\n  The bill thus requires more accurate accounting of the benefits and \nprivileges that sometimes come with public office. Requiring lobbyists \nto disclose all gifts over $20 will cause not only the lobbyist but \nalso the recipient to more scrupulously adhere to existing gift limits. \nFair evaluation of tickets to sporting and entertainment events and for \nair travel aboard private planes is another way of giving real effect \nto the gift rules of Congress.\n  I have read news reports that the Department of Justice is \ninvestigating job negotiations that some public officials may have had \nwith lobbying firms while still in Government, negotiations that may \nhave compromised their job performance. I have long been concerned with \nthe revolving door between public service and the private sector, how \nthat door is spun to personal gain, and the corrupting influences that \ncan creep through that door into Government decisionmaking. To address \nthe problem, I am proposing to expand the cooling off period to 2 years \nfor Members of Congress and senior staff and certain executive branch \nofficials. And to ensure a level playing field, I am seeking to close a \nloophole that has existed in Federal conflict-of-interest laws for \nthose who represent Indian tribes.\n  Informed citizenry is essential to a thriving democracy. A democratic \ngovernment operates best in the disinfecting light of the public eye. \nThe approach on this bill is thus one of greater disclosure of and \ntransparency into the interactions of lobbyists with our public \nofficials.\n  The bill is intended to balance the right of the public to know with \nits right to petition Government, the ability of lobbyists to advocate \ntheir clients' cause with a need for truthful public discourse, and the \nability of Members to legislate with the imperative that our Government \nmust be free from corrupting influences, both real and perceived.\n  We must act now to ensure that the erosion we see today in the \npublic's confidence in Congress does not become a collapse of \nconfidence. That is why I would hope my colleagues would carefully \nexamine this measure. I have had conversations with numerous other \nMembers of this body, and I hope that both Republican and Democrat can \njoin together on this issue.\n  I noted in today's--Friday, December 16--Congress Daily, there is a \nlittle chart in the corner, and it says: ``2005 Congressional Approval \nRatings.'' I notice a very interesting trend. On February 1 of this \nyear, approximately 40-some percent--about 44 percent--of the people \napproved, and about 43 percent disapproved. Those numbers have changed \nsomewhat dramatically to a disapproval rating, in the last couple of \ndays, of 64 percent, with a 26-percent approval rating. I repeat: 64 \npercent disapprove, 26 percent approve.\n  Now, I am not sure that is divided up between Democrats and \nRepublicans. From my travels--and I have been traveling a lot lately in \nthe last few weeks around the country--I find that disapproval is \nnonpartisan in nature. I think there are a number of reasons for that \ndisapproval, and many of them I will not chronicle here. But one of \nthem is that there is a deep perception that we do not act on the \npriorities of the American people, that special interests set our \nagenda here rather than the people's interest.\n  Now, I do not pretend that a lobbying reform bill will be the panacea \nfor all the ills that I think beset this Capitol of ours, but I do \nbelieve it is part of an effort we all need to make--and seriously \nmake--in order to try to turn these kinds of numbers around, not only \nfor our individual well-being but for the well-being of the people of \nthe United States because it will be more difficult to act effectively \nif we do not have at least a significant amount of support from the \npeople whom we purport to represent.\n  I would like to say another word about lobbyists. Lobbying is an \nhonorable profession. I have no problem with it. I have no problem with \npeople working in order to bring the people's interests and agenda and \npriorities to the attention of Congress. Almost all of us who I know of \nrely on their input on various issues. Many supply us with policy \npapers, with data, et cetera.\n  But, Mr. President--Mr. President--when we have the behavior that we \nhighlighted, what actually was brought to our attention during our \nIndian Affairs Committee hearings, it is not believable: luxury sports \nboxes, a sham international think tank in Rehoboth Beach, a sniper \nworkshop in Israel, the list goes on and on. And, of course, the way \nthe Native Americans were treated was especially insulting.\n  Congress, according to the Constitution, has a special obligation in \nregard to Indian affairs. But I will tell you what, I greatly fear that \nthese practices we have uncovered concerning Native Americans are far \nmore widespread than just lobbying efforts on behalf of Native \nAmericans--or exploitation of Native Americans is probably the better \ndescription.\n  I do not think there is any doubt that one of the reasons the \nAmerican people mistrust us is they think there is wrongdoing, if not \ncorruption, in this town. We have an obligation to fix this system as \nwell as we can, and I believe that one of the measures that needs to be \ntaken is to have a lobbying transparency and accountability that can \ngive us confidence.\n  I note the presence of my friend from Connecticut on the floor whom I \nhave had discussions with on this issue. I have had them with my \ncolleague, Senator Feingold, and many others. I hope we can, over the \nrecess, think about this issue and be prepared to address it as early \nas possible. We have a long way to go to restore accountability, \ntransparency, and the confidence of the American people.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I came to the floor to thank my friend from Arizona \nnot just for the legislation he has just introduced but for his \ncharacteristically courageous investigation of the events surrounding a \nparticular lobbyist, Jack Abramoff, and the way in which they \ndemonstrate the extent to which the system has gone out of control.\n  The direct victims here, of course, are those whose money was \nessentially taken without cause, who were cheated. But the indirect, \nyet very real, victims of these abuses are the Members of Congress, and \nthe extent to which there has been abuse of a classic and very critical \nfunction of our Government--lobbying--the extent to which there has \nbeen abuse of that role breaks the public trust in Congress itself.\n  Disclosures, investigations such as Senator McCain and his committee \nhave been involved in, fearlessly, are critically important, but these \ndisclosures and revelations and abuses cry out to us now to take some \nlegislative action. I have not had the opportunity yet to review fully \nthe provisions of the legislation Senator McCain has introduced. I look \nforward to doing that\n\n[[Page S13793]]\n\nover the recess. I hope that will put me in a position to join him as a \nsponsor of this legislation. It would be an honor and a privilege to \nwork with him on this matter, as it has been to work on so many other \nmatters.\n  For today, I did not want this moment to go by without thanking him \nfor coming forward with this legislation. It makes the point we are \ndue--perhaps, in fact, overdue--for a review of our lobbying and \ndisclosure laws. They need strengthening, and they need strengthening \nbecause it is right to do so and it is necessary to do so to restore \nthe public trust in our Government.\n  Mr. President, I am privileged to serve as the ranking member on the \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. In the normal \ncourse of the Senate rules, I believe this legislation would be \nreferred to our committee, and there I look forward, along with the \nchairman, Senator Collins, to reviewing it. But in a personal sense, I \nwant to work with Senator McCain and his staff and mine over the recess \nand hope that I can join him as a cosponsor of this legislation after \nthe first of the year.\n  I thank my friend, Senator Durbin, for yielding me these few moments. \nI yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I join in echoing the comments of the \nSenator from Connecticut about what we just heard from the Senator from \nArizona. He has really touched an important issue. There is no doubt in \nmy mind there is a crisis in confidence in terms of the integrity of \nCongress. Unless and until we deal with that directly, little else we \nmight do will be noticed or believed. I believe he is on the right \ntrack.\n  But I would suggest to him there is something more to the story. It \nis not just a question of lobbyists larding Members of Congress with \ngifts, trips to Scotland for golf outings or lavish meals or whatever \nit happens to be. There is more to the story, and it really goes to the \nheart of the issue about how we get to Congress and how we get to the \nSenate.\n  It is no longer ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,'' if it ever was. It \nis no longer a matter of putting your candidacy before the people of \nthe State and asking that they consider you and wait for the \nconsequence. It is a money chase. It is a huge money chase. And unless \nyou happen to be one of the fortunate few and independently wealthy, \nyou have to spend an awful lot of time chasing it, an awful lot of time \nraising money.\n  If you come from a State, as I do, like Illinois, you know an \nordinary Senate campaign in my State is going to cost anywhere from $5 \nmillion to $20 million to $40 million. Now, imagine, if you will, for a \nmoment that you had to raise that sum of money, and the largest \ncontribution was in the range of $4,000. It takes a lot of time, and it \ntakes a lot of contacts, and it takes a lot of commitment. So what you \nfind is that as people of the Senate are running for reelection, for \nexample, they are spending more and more and more time on the road \nraising money. They are finding precious little time to dedicate to \ntheir constituents or to the work of Congress because they are out \nraising huge sums of money.\n  That is part of the reality of the relationship between Members of \nCongress and lobbyists. Many of these lobbyists also are fundraisers, \nso to have them on your side is to guarantee they will not only buy you \ndiner, if that is what you are looking for, but also help you in this \nfundraising effort. I think real, ethical reform, which gets to the \nheart of the issue, has to get to the issue of how we finance these \ncampaigns.\n  Unless and until we bring campaigns for election and reelection to \nthe U.S. Senate and the House of Representatives to a level where they \nare affordable for common people, I am afraid we are going to continue \nto be enslaved by the current system, which requires us to raise so \nmuch money from so many people.\n  I can recall when the Republican leader Tom DeLay announced he was \nstarting something called the K Street project. He was a House leader, \nand he said he was going to set out to make sure that the lobbyists who \ncame to see him were all loyal Republicans, loyal contributors. He \ndidn't want to see Democratic lobbyists. He prevailed on major \nassociations and organizations not to hire anybody other than a \nRepublican who had met with his approval.\n  For those of us who have been around this Hill for a while, it was \npretty clear what he was creating. He was creating a very generous \nnetwork of people, who would lobby him on legislation, whom he would \npossibly reward and then find their support in his campaign. It had \nbuilt into it some very perilous opportunities. I won't talk about his \nsituation in Texas. Let that be decided in Texas. But unless and until \nwe get to the heart of the issue, the financing of campaigns, I am \nafraid we are not going to be able to deal forthrightly with the \ncharges of corruption against Congress.\n  Let me add why campaigns cost so much money. Certainly in Illinois \nand most other States, it is all about television. It is all about \nmillions of dollars which I have to raise to then give to television \nstations in my State. It troubles me because what those television \nstations are selling to me is something I own, something all Americans \nown--the airwaves. So we are paying premium dollars to television \nstations to run our ads for election and reelection. We are raising \nmillions of dollars to make sure that we transfer this money as if it \nwere a trust fund from our contributors directly to TV stations. It is \nabout time we change the fundamentals in America. In changing the \nfundamentals, we can bring real reform.\n  I supported McCain-Feingold. Senators McCain and Feingold talked \nabout limiting soft money. That is the tip of the iceberg. It is \ninsidious, the soft money that came into campaigns, but the real \nproblem is the cost of campaigns and the millions you have to raise to \npay for television. If we said basically that in our country incumbents \nand challengers will have access to a certain amount of television to \ndeliver their message at an affordable rate, we would dramatically drop \nthe cost of campaigns, dramatically reduce the need to fund raise, and \ndramatically reduce our dependence on the sources of funds, whether \nthey are generous individuals, special interest groups, or lobbyists.\n  We have to get to the heart of the issue. It isn't an appetite for \ngolfing in Scotland; it is an appetite for money you need to run your \ncampaign.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAPO (for himself and Mr. Craig):\n  S. 2129. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to convey \ncertain land and improvements of the Gooding Division of the Minidoka \nProject, Idaho; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce a bill today to \nformally convey title a portion of the American Falls Reservoir \nDistrict from the Bureau of Reclamation to the National Park Service. \nThe Minidoka Internment National Monument Draft General Management Plan \nand Environment Impact Statement proposes the transfer of these two \npublicly owned parcels of land, which are both within and adjacent to \nthe existing 73-acre NPS boundary, and have been identified as \nimportant for inclusion as part of the monument. The sites were both \nwithin the original 33,000-acre Minidoka Relocation Center that was \noperated by the War Relocation Authority, where approximately 13,500 \nJapanese and Japanese Americans were held from 1942 through 1945.\n  The smaller 2.31-acre parcel is located in the center of the monument \nin the old warehouse area and includes three historical buildings and \nother important cultural features. The Draft General Management Plan \nproposes to use this site for visitor services, including a Visitor \nContact Station within an original warehouse to greet visitors and \nprovide orientation for the monument. The other, a 7.87-acre parcel, is \non the east end of the monument and was undeveloped during WWII. The \nNPS proposes to use this area for special events and to provide a site \nfor the development of a memorial for the Issei, first-generation \nJapanese immigrants.

A bill to amend title 9, United Stares Code, to provide for \ngreater fairness in the arbitration process relating to livestock and \npoultry contracts; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to re-introduce the Fair \nContracts for Growers Act of 2005. This bill would simply give farmers \na choice of venues to resolve disputes associated with agricultural \ncontracts. This legislation would not prohibit arbitration. Instead, it \nwould ensure that the decision to arbitrate is truly voluntary and that \nthe rights and remedies provided for by our judicial system are not \nwaived under coercion.\n  I certainly recognize that arbitration has tremendous benefits. It \ncan often be less costly than other dispute settlement means. It can \nalso remove some of the workload from our Nation's overburdened court \nsystem. For these reasons, arbitration must be an option--but it should \nnot be a coerced option.\n  Mandatory arbitration clauses are used in a growing number of \nagricultural contracts between individual farmers and processors. These \nprovisions limit a farmer's ability to resolve a dispute with the \ncompany, even when a violation of Federal or State law is suspected. \nRather than having the option to pursue a claim in court, disputes are \nrequired to go through an arbitration process that puts the farmer at a \nsevere disadvantage. Such disputes often involve instances of \ndiscrimination, fraud, or negligent misrepresentation. The effect of \nthese violations for the individual farmer can be bankruptcy and \nfinancial ruin, and mandatory arbitration clauses make it impossible \nfor farmers to seek redress in court.\n  When a farmer chooses arbitration, the farmer is waving rights to \naccess to the courts and the constitutional right to a jury trial. \nCertain standardized court rules are also waived, such as the right to \ndiscovery. This is important because the farmer must prove his case, \nthe company has the relevant information, and the farmer can not \nprevail unless he can compel disclosure of relevant information.\n  Examples of farmers' concerns that have gone unaddressed due to \nlimitations on dispute resolution options include; mis-weighed animals, \nbad feed cases, wrongful termination of contracts, diseased swine or \nbirds provided by the company, fraud and misrepresentation to induce a \ngrower to enter a contract, and retaliation by companies against \nfarmers who join producer associations.\n  During consideration of the Farm Bill, the Senate passed, by a vote \nof 64-31, the Feingold-Grassley amendment\n\n[[Page S13795]]\n\nto give farmers a choice of venues to resolve disputes associated with \nagricultural contracts.\n  I have some letters supporting this legislation and ask unanimous \nconsent that they be printed in the Record.\n  I also ask unanimous consent that the text of bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                      Organization for Competitive\n\n\n                                                      Markets,\n\n                                   Lincoln, NE, November 15, 2005.\n     Re: Fair Contracts for Growers Act.\n\n     Hon. Charles Grassley,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Senator Grassley:\n       1. The Organization for Competitive Markets would like to \n     express its support for your Fair Contracts for Growers Act. \n     Arbitration has a role in dispute resolution in the livestock \n     industry, and in other economic sectors. It should not be an \n     abuse tool. Your bill will remedy this.\n       2. The U.S. Constitution, Amendment 7 says this: ``. . . \n     the right of trial by jury shall be preserved . . .''. The \n     law says citizens can waive this right, but the law also says \n     waivers should be knowing and voluntary.\n       3. It is a fact integrators and packers have more \n     information and sophistication, and more power, when \n     contracting with producers. Producers rely on integrator/\n     packer representations when making business decisions \n     including contract signing or rejection. Mandatory \n     arbitration clauses are not explained or negotiated, but \n     merely included in boilerplate language.\n       4. Producers are unable to knowingly and voluntarily waive \n     their right to a court-resolved future dispute. This is true \n     because they cannot anticipate the type of possible disputes \n     which may arise. The American Medical Assn, American \n     Arbitration Assn, and American Bar Assn have agreed with this \n     principal in the context of consumer health care contracts.\n       5. Producers must be provided real, not illusory, choice. \n     Your bill leaves producers free to agree to arbitration once \n     a dispute arises, but prohibits this forced ``choice'' \n     before. Thank you for your efforts for U.S. livestock and \n     poultry producers.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                       Keith Mudd,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                           Iowa Farmers Union,\n\n                                                         Ames, IA.\n     Hon. Charles Grassley,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Grassley: I am writing on behalf of Iowa \n     Farmers Union, Women, Food and Agriculture Network (WFAN) and \n     the Iowa Chapter of National Farmers Organization to express \n     our strong support for the Fair Contracts for Growers Act, \n     and to thank you for your leadership in introducing this \n     legislation.\n       Contract livestock and poultry producers are being forced \n     to sign mandatory arbitration clauses, as part of a take-it-\n     or-leave-it, non-negotiable contract with large, vertically \n     integrated processing firms. These producers forfeit their \n     basic constitutional right to a jury trial, and instead must \n     accept an alternative dispute resolution forum that severely \n     limits their rights and is often prohibitively expensive. \n     These clauses are signed before any dispute arises, leaving \n     farmers little if any ability to seek justice if they become \n     the victim of fraudulent or abusive trade practices.\n       Because basic legal processes such as discovery are waived \n     in arbitration, it becomes very difficult for a farmer or \n     grower to prove their case. In these cases, the company has \n     control over the information needed for growers to argue \n     their case. In a civil court case, this evidence would be \n     available to a grower's attorney through discovery. In an \n     arbitration proceeding, the company is not required to \n     provide access to this information, thus placing the farmer/\n     grower at an extreme disadvantage. Other standard legal \n     rights that are waived through arbitration are access to \n     mediation and appeal, as well as the right to an explanation \n     of the decision.\n       Many assume that arbitration is a less costly way of \n     resolving dispute than going to court, but for the producer, \n     the opposite is usually true. The high cost of arbitration is \n     often a significant barrier to most farmers. The up-front \n     filing fees and arbitrator fees can exceed the magnitude of \n     the dispute itself, with farmers being required to pay fees \n     in the thousands of dollars just to start the arbitration \n     process.\n       Arbitration can be a valid and effective method of dispute \n     resolution when agreed to voluntarily through negotiation by \n     two parties of similar power, but when used by a dominant \n     party to limit the legal recourse of a weaker party in a non-\n     negotiable contract, it becomes an abusive weapon. \n     Independent family farmers all over the U.S. will benefit \n     from a law that stops the abuse of arbitration clauses in \n     livestock and poultry contracts.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Chris Petersen,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     Center for Rural Affairs,\n\n                                                        Lyons, NE.\n       Dear Senator Grassley: I am writing on behalf of the Center \n     for Rural Affairs to express our strong support for the Fair \n     Contacts for Growers Act, and to thank you for your \n     leadership in introducing this legislation.\n       The Fair Contracts for Growers Act is very timely. With the \n     rapid rise of vertically integrated methods of agricultural \n     production, farmers are increasingly producing agricultural \n     products under contract with large processors. Under these \n     contracts, it is common for farmers and growers to be forced \n     to sign mandatory arbitration clauses, as part of a take-it-\n     or-leave-it, non-negotiable contract with a large, vertically \n     integrated processing firm. In doing so, the farmer is forced \n     to give up their basic constitutional right to a jury trial, \n     and instead must accept an alternative dispute resolution \n     forum that severely limits their rights and is often \n     prohibitively expensive. These clauses are signed before any \n     dispute arises, leaving farmers little if any ability to seek \n     justice if they become the victim of fraudulent or abusive \n     trade practices.\n       Because basic legal processes such as discovery are waived \n     in arbitration, it becomes very difficult for a farmer or \n     grower to prove their case. In these cases, the company has \n     control of the information needed for a grower to argue their \n     case. In a civil court case, this evidence would be available \n     to a growers' attorney through discovery. In an arbitration \n     proceeding, the company is not required to provide access to \n     this information, thus placing the farmer/grower at an \n     extreme disadvantage. Other standard legal rights that are \n     waived through arbitration are access to mediation and \n     appeal, as well as the right to an explanation of the \n     decision.\n       In addition, it is often assumed that arbitration is a less \n     costly way of resolving dispute than going to court. Yet for \n     the farmer, the opposite is usually true. The high cost of \n     arbitration is often a significant barrier to most farmers. \n     The up-front filing fees and arbitrator fees can exceed the \n     magnitude of the dispute itself, with farmers being required \n     to pay fees in the thousands of dollars just to start the \n     arbitration process.\n       Arbitration can be a valid and effective method of dispute \n     resolution when agreed to voluntarily through negotiation by \n     two parties of similar power, but when used by a dominant \n     party to limit the legal recourse of a weaker party in a non-\n     negotiable contract, it becomes an abusive weapon.\n       The Center for Rural Affairs believes this is important \n     because of the number of small and mid-size farms that enter \n     into contract livestock production. Small and mid-size farms \n     that don't have the capital to invest in starting their own \n     livestock operations often look to contract production as \n     mechanism for diversifying their farming operations as well \n     as their cash flow. However, when these farmers and ranchers \n     are not allowed equal legal protection, their entire farming \n     operations lay at risk.\n       Moreover, farmers who enter into contracts with meatpackers \n     and large, corporate livestock producers will never have the \n     power or negotiating position that those companies will enjoy \n     in virtually every contract dispute. Producers often lack the \n     financial and legal resources to challenge vertical \n     integrators when their rights are violated. A legal agreement \n     between smaller farm operations and integrators should, \n     therefore, provide at least as much legal protection for \n     producers as it does for the integrator.\n       Although the impetus behind this legislation emanates from \n     the poultry industry, the rights of farmers who raise hogs \n     and other livestock under contract are also threatened. And \n     the increased use of production contracts in these sectors \n     has made this issue that much more important to farmers in \n     the Midwest and Great Plains as well.\n       Thank you for your leadership in recognizing these \n     concerns, and your willingness to introduce commonsense \n     legislation to stop the abuse of arbitration clauses in the \n     livestock and poultry contracts.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Traci Bruckner,\n     Associate Director, Rural Policy Program.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           Sustainable Agriculture\n\n\n                                                    Coalition,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 17, 2005.\n     Senator Chuck Grassley,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Grassley: I am writing on behalf of the \n     Sustainable Agriculture Coalition in support of the Fair \n     Contract for Growers Act and to thank you for your leadership \n     in introducing this legislation.\n       The Fair Contracts for Growers Act is necessary to help \n     level the playing field for our farmers and ranchers who \n     enter into production contracts with packers and processors. \n     The rapid rise of vertically integrated production chains, \n     combined with the high degree of concentration of poultry \n     processors and meatpackers, leave farmers and ranchers in \n     many regions of the country with few choices, or only a \n     single choice, of buyers for their production. Increasingly, \n     farmers and ranchers are confronted with ``take-it-or-leave-\n     it,'' non-negotiable contracts, written by the company. These \n     contracts require that farmers and ranchers give up the basic \n     constitutional right of access to the courts and sign \n     mandatory arbitration clauses if they want access to a market \n     for their products. These clauses are signed before any \n     dispute arises, leaving the producers little, if\n\n[[Page S13796]]\n\n     any, ability to seek justice if they become the victim of \n     fraudulent or abusive trade practices.\n       Arbitration can be a valid and effective method of dispute \n     resolution when agreed to voluntarily through negotiation by \n     two parties of similar power, but when used by a dominant \n     party to limit the legal recourse of a weaker party in a non-\n     negotiable contract, it becomes an abusive weapon. Many basic \n     legal processes are not available to farmers and ranchers in \n     arbitration. In most agricultural production contract \n     disputes, the company has control of the information needed \n     for a grower to argue a case. In a civil court case, this \n     evidence would be available to the grower's attorney through \n     discovery. In an arbitration proceeding, however, the company \n     is not required to provide access to this information, thus \n     placing the grower at an extreme disadvantage. In addition, \n     in most arbitration proceedings, a decision is issued without \n     an opinion providing an explanation of the principles and \n     standards or even the facts considered in reaching the \n     decision. The arbitration proceeding is private, closed to \n     effective pubic safeguards, and the arbitration decisions are \n     often confidential and rarely subject to public oversight or \n     judicial review.\n       Moreover, there is a growing perception that the \n     arbitration system is biased towards the companies. This \n     private system is basically supported financially by the \n     companies which are involved repeatedly in arbitration cases. \n     The companies also know the history of previous arbitrations, \n     including which arbitrators repeatedly decide in the \n     companies' favor. This arbitration history is rarely \n     available to a farmer or rancher involved in a single \n     arbitration proceeding.\n       Arbitration is often assumed to be a less costly way of \n     resolving disputes than litigation. But this assumption must \n     be tested in light of the relative resources of the parties. \n     For most farmers and ranchers, arbitration is a significant \n     expense in relation to their income. One immediate \n     financial barrier is filing fees and case service fees, \n     which in arbitration are usually divided between the \n     parties. A few thousand dollars out of pocket is a \n     miniscule expense for a well-heeled company but can be an \n     insurmountable barrier for a farmer with a modest income, \n     especially when the farmer is conflict with the farmer's \n     chief source of income. This significant cost barrier, \n     when coupled with the disadvantages of the arbitration \n     process, can effectively deny farmers a remedy in contract \n     dispute cases with merit.\n       The Sustainable Agriculture Coalition represents family \n     farm, rural development, and conservation and environmental \n     organizations that share a commitment to federal policy \n     reform to promote sustainable agriculture and rural \n     development. Coalition member organizations include the \n     Agriculture and Land Based Training Association, American \n     Natural Heritage Foundation, C.A.S.A. del Llano (Communities \n     Assuring a Sustainable Agriculture), Center for Rural \n     Affairs, Dakota Rural Action, Delta Land and Community, Inc., \n     Future Harvest-CASA (Chesapeake Alliance for Sustainable \n     Agriculture), Illinois Stewardship Alliance, Innovative \n     Farmers of Ohio, Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy, \n     Iowa Environmental Council, Iowa Natural Heritage Foundation, \n     Kansas Rural Center, Kerr Center for Sustainable Agriculture, \n     Land Stewardship Project, Michael Fields Agricultural \n     Institute, Michigan Agricultural Stewardship Association, \n     Midwest Organic and Sustainable Education Service, The \n     Minnesota Project, National Catholic Rural Life Conference, \n     National Center for Appropriate Technology, Northern Plains \n     Sustainable Agriculture Society, Ohio Ecological Food and \n     Farm Association, Organic Farming Research Foundation, and \n     the Sierra Club Agriculture Committee. Our member \n     organizations included thousands of farmers and ranchers with \n     small and mid-size operations, a number of whom have entered \n     into agricultural production contracts or are considering \n     whether to sign these contracts. As individuals, these \n     farmers and ranchers do not have the financial power or \n     negotiating position that companies enjoy in virtually every \n     contract dispute. We agree with Senator Grassley that, in the \n     face of such unequal bargaining power, the Fair Contract for \n     Growers Act is a modest and appropriate step which allows \n     growers the choice of entering into arbitration or mediation \n     or choosing to exercise their basic legal right of access to \n     the courts.\n       Thank you for your leadership in recognizing these \n     concerns, and your willingness to introduce commonsense \n     legislation to stop the abuse of mandatory arbitration \n     clauses in livestock and poultry contracts.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              Martha L. Noble,\n\n                                          Senior Policy Associate,\n     Sustainable Agriculture Coalition.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               National Family Farm Coalition,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 17, 2005.\n     Senator Charles Grassley,\n     Hart Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Grassley. I am writing as president of the \n     National Family Farm Coalition to express our strong support \n     for the Fair Contracts for Growers Act, and to thank you for \n     your leadership in introducing this legislation. As you know, \n     the National Family Farm Coalition provides a voice for \n     grassroots groups on farm, food, trade and rural economic \n     issues to ensure fair prices for family farmers, safe and \n     healthy food, and vibrant, environmentally sound rural \n     communities here and around the world. Our organization is \n     committed to promoting food sovereignty, which is stymied by \n     current practices that give farmers unfair and unjust \n     difficulties when they wish to arbitrate a contract dispute.\n       Therefore, the Fair Contracts for Growers Act is very \n     timely. With the rapid rise of vertically integrated methods \n     of agricultural production, farmers are increasingly \n     producing agricultural products under contract with large \n     processors. Under these contracts, it is common for farmers \n     and growers to be forced to sign mandatory arbitration \n     clauses, as part of a take-it-or-leave-it, non-negotiable \n     contract with a large, vertically integrated processing firm. \n     In doing so, the farmer is forced to give up their basic \n     constitutional right to a jury trial, and instead must accept \n     an alternative dispute resolution forum that severely limits \n     their rights and is often prohibitively expensive. These \n     clauses are signed before any dispute arises, leaving farmers \n     little if any ability to seek justice if they become the \n     victim of fraudulent or abusive trade practices.\n       Because basic legal processes such as discovery are waived \n     in arbitration, it becomes very difficult for a farmer or \n     grower to prove their case. In these cases, the company has \n     control of the information needed for a grower to argue their \n     case. In a civil court case, this evidence would be available \n     to a growers' attorney through discovery. In an arbitration \n     proceeding, the company is not required to provide access to \n     this information, thus placing the farmer/grower at an \n     extreme disadvantage. Other standard legal rights that are \n     waived through arbitration are access to mediation and \n     appeal, as well as the right to an explanation of the \n     decision.\n       In addition, it is often assumed that arbitration is a less \n     costly way of resolving dispute than going to court. Yet for \n     the farmer, the opposite is usually true. The high cost of \n     arbitration is often a significant barrier to most farmers. \n     The up-front filing fees and arbitrator fees can exceed the \n     magnitude of the dispute itself, with farmers being required \n     to pay fees in the thousands of dollars just to start the \n     arbitration process.\n       Arbitration can be a valid and effective method of dispute \n     resolution when agreed to voluntarily through negotiation by \n     two parties of similar power, but when used by a dominant \n     party to limit the legal recourse of a weaker party in a non-\n     negotiable contract, it becomes an abusive weapon.\n       Thank you for your leadership in recognizing these \n     concerns, and your willingness to introduce common sense \n     legislation to stop the abuse of arbitration clauses in the \n     livestock and poultry contracts.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                George Naylor,\n\n                                                        President,\n     National Family Farm Coalition.\n                                  ____\n\n                                             Campaign for Contract\n\n\n                                           Agriculture Reform,\n\n                                                November 18, 2005.\n     Hon. Charles Grassley,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Grassley: On behalf of the Campaign for \n     Contract Agriculture Reform, I would like to thank you for \n     your leadership in introducing the Fair Contracts for Growers \n     Act.\n       With the rapid rise of vertically integrated methods of \n     agricultural production, farmers are increasingly producing \n     agricultural products under contract with large processors. \n     In many cases, particularly in the livestock and poultry \n     sector, the farmer never actually owns the product they \n     produce, but instead makes large capital investments on their \n     own land to build the facilities necessary to raise animals \n     for an ``integrator.''\n       Under such contract arrangements, farmers and growers are \n     often given take-it-or-leave-it, non-negotiable contracts, \n     with language drafted by the integrator in a manner designed \n     to maximize the company's profits and shift risk to the \n     grower. In many cases, the farmer has little choice but to \n     sign the contract presented to them, or accept bankruptcy. \n     The legal term for such contracts is ``contract of \n     adhesion.'' As contracts of adhesion become more commonplace \n     in agriculture, the abuses that often characterize such \n     contracts are also becoming more commonplace and more \n     egregious.\n       One practice that has become common in livestock and \n     poultry production contracts is the use of mandatory \n     arbitration clauses, where growers are forced to sign away \n     their constitutional rights to jury trial upon signing a \n     contract with an integrator, and instead accept a dispute \n     resolution forum that denies their basic legal rights and is \n     too costly for most growers to pursue.\n       Because basic legal processes such as discovery are waived \n     in arbitration, it becomes very difficult for a farmer or \n     grower to prove their case. In these cases, the company has \n     control of the information needed for a grower to argue their \n     case. In a civil court case, this evidence would be available \n     to a grower's attorney through discovery. In an arbitration \n     proceeding, the company is not required to provide access to \n     this information, thus placing the farmer/grower at an \n     extreme disadvantage. Other standard legal rights that are \n     waived through arbitration are access to mediation and \n     appeal, as well as the right to an explanation of the \n     decision.\n       In addition, it is often assumed that arbitration is a less \n     costly way of resolving dispute than going to court. Yet for \n     the farmer,\n\n[[Page S13797]]\n\n     the opposite is usually true. The high cost of arbitration is \n     often a significant barrier to most farmers. The up-front \n     filing fees and arbitrator fees can exceed the magnitude of \n     the dispute itself. For example, in one Mississippi case, \n     filing fees for a poultry grower to begin an arbitration \n     proceeding were $11,000. In contrast, filing fees for a civil \n     court case are $150 to $250. Lawyer fees in a civil case are \n     often paid on a contingent-fee basis.\n       In addition, the potential for mandatory arbitration \n     clauses to be used abusively by a dominant party in a \n     contract has also been recognized by Congress with regard to \n     other sectors of our economy. In 2002, legislation was \n     enacted with broad bipartisan support that prohibits the use \n     of pre-dispute, mandatory arbitration clauses in contracts \n     between car dealers and car manufacturers and distributors. \n     The Fair Contract for Growers Act is nearly identical in \n     structure to the ``car dealer'' arbitration bill passed by \n     Congress in 2002.\n       Thank you again for introducing the Fair Contracts for \n     Growers Act, to assure that arbitration in livestock and \n     poultry contracts is truly voluntary, after mutual agreement \n     of both parties after a dispute arises. If used, arbitration \n     should be a tool for honest dispute resolution, not a weapon \n     used to limit a farmer's right to seek justice for abusive \n     trade practices.\n       I look forward to working with you toward enactment of this \n     important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Steven D. Etka,\n     Legislative Coordinator.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                                S. 2131\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to Include Idaho and Montana as affected areas for \npurposes of making claims under the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act \n(42 U.S.C. 2210 note) based on exposure to atmospheric nuclear testing; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation on behalf \nof myself, Senator Burns of Montana and my Colleague Senator  Craig \nthat would include the States of Idaho and Montana as affected areas \nunder the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, or RECA.\n  Since our goals of giving affected citizens in our States the \nopportunity to receive compensation under RECA, and the challenges \nfaced by our constituents are the same, it is appropriate to combine \nour efforts toward rectifying the problem.\n  Nuclear testing in Nevada during the 1950s and 1960s released \nradiation into the atmosphere that settled in States far away from the \noriginal test site. Certain elements of this radiation such as the \nradioactive isotope Iodine-131 settled in States such as Idaho and \nMontana and found their way into the milk supply. After time, in some \ncases 25 to 50 years after the fact, this contamination manifested \nitself as various forms of cancer, leukemia and other illnesses, \nparticularly thyroid cancer. Those affected in this way are often \nreferred to as ``downwinders,'' to denote their location downwind from \nthe fallout.\n  In 1990, Congress recognized the need for the Federal Government to \nmake amends for the harm caused to innocent citizens by nuclear testing \nand the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act was passed into law. \nUnfortunately, the science at the time did not recognize that \nradioactive fallout did not restrict itself by State lines.\n  This was highlighted in 1999, when a group of Senators, led by \nSenator Hatch, amended the law to include additional counties in \nArizona. During debate on this legislation, Senator Hatch said, ``Our \ncurrent state of scientific knowledge allows us to pinpoint with more \naccuracy which diseases are reasonably believed to be related to \nradiation exposure, and that is what necessitated the legislation we \nare considering today.'' Since that time, even greater advances in \nscience have been made in the area of radiation exposure.\n  When the RECA disparity was first brought to my attention by the \nIdaho downwinders, I met with them to discuss ways to help them. The \nNational Academy of Sciences staff came to Idaho in 2004 to hear \ntestimony from those affected and ensure that their concerns and \ncomments were included in the process.\n  Their voices were heard; the NAS report released in April of 2005 \nrecognized that, among the 25 counties with the highest per capita \ndosage of radiation, 20 of those counties are in Idaho and Montana. In \nfact, Idaho is home to four of the top five counties in this regard. \nThe report also stated that, ``To be equitable, any compensation \nprogram needs to be based on scientific criteria and similar cases must \nbe treated alike. The current geographic limitations are not based on \nthe latest science.'' Understanding these facts, it is of prime \nimportance that we rectify the problem quickly.\n  The NAS report recognizes that the RECA program needs to be updated \nand that affected Idahoans and Montanans deserve equal treatment with \nthose in other States. The report makes several specific \nrecommendations, chief among them that Congress should establish a new \nprocess for reviewing individual claims, based on probability of \ncausation, or ``assigned share,'' a method which is used in the courts \nand for other radiation compensation programs. I am currently working \nwith my colleagues to legislatively address the suggestions made by the \nNAS report and work out a long-term solution for the challenges \ncurrently posed by RECA.\n  We all recognize that this problem requires a two-part solution--\nexpanding the current RECA program to include those left behind while \nat the same time working on the long-term fixes recommended by the NAS. \nThese efforts must happen simultaneously and I am pleased that my \ncolleagues are partnering with me on this course.\n  Tragically, for some, it is already too late. A long-time advocate \nfor the downwinders, and personal friend, Sheri Garmon, passed away \nfrom cancer this summer. Others preceded her and some are sick right \nnow. There are still a number of those affected who are still waiting \nfor the Government to do the right thing and make them eligible for \ncompensation for their injuries. The facts are in and the science shows \nthat they should not have to wait any longer for their rightful \nopportunity to seek appropriate redress. Let's fix this while we still \nhave some of those who are sick because of Government actions with us.\n  I would exhort my colleagues to join with me and Senators Burns and \nCraig to take up this legislation we have introduced today and bring \nneeded fairness to those in Idaho and Montana and extend them \neligibility under the current Radiation Exposure Compensation Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S13798]]\n\n                                S. 2132\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and \nEmergency Assistance Act to include foreseeable catastrophic events as \nmajor disasters, to permit States affected by an event occurring \nelsewhere to receive assistance, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, the massive devastation inflicted \nupon our southern States by hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma \nreminded all Americans how important it is that the Federal Government \nbe able to respond quickly and effectively when disaster strikes. We \nalso learned from those tragedies that we must assist in ways few of us \nhad imagined--for example, to meet the needs of evacuees who were \ndispersed far from the disaster.\n  Other events of the past few years, both here at home and abroad, \nhave taught us that we must prepare for more than just natural \ndisasters. Accidents, acts of terrorism, and pandemic illnesses also \nthreaten us with death, injury, and destruction. And while we work to \nminimize the threats, we must assume that such disasters will really \nhappen.\n  I have concluded that the President's current statuary authority to \nrespond to disasters is not sufficient to meet the threats that we all \nnow recognize as real, though once they were unimaginable. Today, I am \nintroducing the Disaster Relief Act 2005 to modernize our disaster \nresponse capability for the 21st century.\n  One of the principal authorities we have given the President for \ndisaster management is the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and \nEmergency Assistance Act. This is the law that authorizes the \nPresident, at the request of a Governor, to declare an ``Emergency'' or \na ``Major Disaster,'' which then enables various types of Federal \nassistance. Emergency is the lower level declaration. The President is \ngiven great latitude in the types of events that can be declared \nemergencies, but relief is generally limited to $5 million per \ndeclaration. A major disaster declaration allows much greater \nassistance, but can be made only for natural disasters or, from any \ncause, fire, flood, or explosion.\n  The Department of Homeland Security uses 15 disaster scenarios to \nguide planning for the types of catastrophes it has concluded threaten \nour country. Besides natural disasters, the list includes various types \nof terrorist attacks--chemical, biological, radiological, cyber--as \nwell as major health disasters. Though the President could respond to \nany of these scenarios by issuing an Emergency declaration, only seven \nof the fifteen would currently qualify under the Stafford Act to be \ndeclared a major disaster.\n  This bill will modify the definition of a major disaster in the \nStafford Act to direct the President to focus on the impacts of an \nevent in determining whether to issue a declaration. It is indeed the \nsuffering--deaths, injuries, destruction--and not the cause of that \nsuffering, which should determine our response. Catastrophic events, \nforeseeable and yet unimagined, will be covered if the suffering \nexceeds the capacity of the State to respond.\n  Furthermore, under the Stafford Act it is not clear whether States \naffected indirectly by a disaster occurring elsewhere--for example, by \nreceiving evacuees or by the spread of nuclear, toxic, or infectious \nagents--could receive a major disaster declaration. It became clear in \nthe aftermath of Hurricane Katrina that meeting the needs of evacuees \ncan be a difficult challenge. Four States received major disaster \ndeclarations following Katrina. Forty-four others received emergency \ndeclarations to assist evacuees, but not even Texas, which hosted over \n200,000 evacuees, received a major disaster declaration to assist them. \nEven if it were possible to declare a major disaster in a State \nreceiving evacuees, assistance to meet some of their needs--education, \nhealthcare, long-term housing and resettlement--is not adequately \nauthorized under the Stafford Act.\n  Being able to meet the needs of evacuees is an important issue for \nWest Virginia. We hosted several hundred evacuees from Hurricane \nKatrina, just enough to understand the special needs of people who have \nlost their homes and livelihoods, have been moved to unfamiliar places \nwithout resources, have been separated from their families, and \nsuffered in many other ways. A disaster in the Washington-Baltimore \nregion, or in Pennsylvania or Ohio, could bring far more evacuees to \nWest Virginia than we could assist with presently available resources.\n  This bill acknowledges the fact that the impacts of a major disaster \ncan extend far beyond the location of the event, and enables the \nPresident to make major disaster declarations in affected States, \nwherever they may be located. Additional forms of assistance to \nevacuees, found necessary after hurricane Katrina--for education, \nhealthcare, long-term housing, and resettlement--will be made \navailable.\n  Several other aspects of the Stafford Act require our attention, and \nare addressed in the bill. Authorization for Predisaster Hazard \nMitigation under Title II, set to expire at the end of this year, will \nbe extended to 2010. The modest levels of direct assistance to \nindividuals, though indexed to inflation, will be increased because of \nrapid increases in housing costs in recent years. The duration of \nassistance that can be provided by the Department of Defense, for the \npreservation of life and property, will be increased from 10 to 30 \ndays, to meet needs following extreme disasters. It will be clarified \nthat events occurring within the waters surrounding the United States \nare eligible for emergency and major disaster declarations, Efforts to \nrecover costs of assistance when emergencies or major disasters are \ncaused by gross negligence will be authorized. The process for \nappropriating funds for disaster relief will be improved. And other \nminor improvements will be made.\n  I ask my colleagues in the Senate to join me to pass this bill and \nimprove our preparedness for disasters in the 21st century.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2133\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the current definition of a major disaster in section \n     102 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency \n     Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5122) is insufficient to enable the \n     President to respond quickly and efficiently to foreseeable \n     catastrophic events, including many types of potential \n     terrorists attacks, accidents, and health emergencies;\n       (2) more than \\1/2\\ of the disaster planning scenarios used \n     by the Department of Homeland Security to evaluate \n     preparedness would not be covered by that present definition;\n       (3) States affected by a event occurring elsewhere, such as \n     through mass evacuations, the propagation of radioactive or \n     toxic substances, or the transmission of infectious agents, \n     may not be eligible for the declaration of a major disaster \n     or for certain types of assistance;\n       (4) emergency declarations, widely used to provide \n     assistance to evacuees following Hurricane Katrina, may not \n     adequate;\n       (5) some types of assistance found to be necessary \n     following the evacuations associated with Hurricane Katrina, \n     notably assistance for providing public services such as \n     education, healthcare, long-term housing, and resettlement, \n     are not authorized to be provided under the Robert T. \n     Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 5121 et seq.);\n       (6) the process for appropriating funds for disaster \n     assistance is inefficient and often requires supplemental \n     appropriations and certain assistance programs have been \n     delayed by insufficient funds;\n       (7) authorization for the Predisaster Hazard Mitigation \n     program, under title II of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster \n     Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5131 et seq.) \n     will expire on December 31, 2005;\n\n[[Page S13799]]\n\n       (8) while the Federal Government is authorized to recover \n     the cost of providing assistance in the event of major \n     disasters or emergencies caused by deliberate actions, costs \n     resulting from negligent actions cannot be recovered;\n       (9) limits on assistance provided to individuals for repair \n     or replacement of housing and total assistance, though \n     indexed for inflation, do not adequately reflect increases in \n     the costs of housing that have occurred in recent years; and\n       (10) the duration of assistance by the Department of \n     Defense authorized under section 403(c) of the Robert T. \n     Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 5170b(c)) for activities ``essential for the \n     preservation of life and property'' may be insufficient to \n     meet needs following major disasters that are particularly \n     severe or for which the period of recovery is lengthy.\n       (b) Purposes.--\n       (1) In general.--The purpose of this Act is to expand and \n     enhance the authority and capacity of the President of the \n     United States to alleviate suffering and loss resulting from \n     large catastrophic events by appropriately amending the \n     Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance \n     Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq.).\n       (2) Major disasters.--In amending the definition of the \n     term major disaster in section 102(2) of the Robert T. \n     Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 5122(2)), Congress intends to expand the types of \n     events that constitute a major disaster and does not intend \n     to exclude any type of event that would have constituted a \n     major disaster prior to the date of the enactment of this \n     Act.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to strengthen existing programs to assist \nmanufacturing innovation and education, to expand outreach programs for \nsmall and medium-sized manufacturers, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today with Senators Kohl and DeWine \nto introduce the Manufacturing Technology Competitiveness Act of 2005.\n  The manufacturing sector is a critical component of our economy and \nan engine of job creation for millions of Americans. Investment and \ncontinued growth in this industry is vital in order to strengthen \nmanufacturing in the United States and increase our global \ncompetitiveness.\n  Through a number of measures, my legislation is aimed at further \nimproving productivity, advancing technology and increasing the \ncompetitiveness of the U.S. manufacturing industry.\n  My bill authorizes funding through fiscal year 2008 for the \nManufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) and the National Institute of \nStandards and Technology (NIST).\n  MEP is a nationwide network with centers in all 50 states that \nprovide assistance to help small- and medium-sized manufacturers \nsucceed by providing expertise and services customized to meet their \ncritical needs.\n  Small and medium sized manufacturers in my home State of Oregon have \nbenefited from the efforts of the Oregon MEP resulting in increased \njobs, investment and overall productivity. In 2004, the Oregon MEP \nhelped manufacturers generate new or retain sales of $6,835,400 and a \nsave costs of $18,736,000. MEP's assistance has yielded similar success \nfor countless manufacturers in states across the country.\n  In addition to authorizing funding for MEP, this bill will amend \npartnership to include a mechanism for review and re-competition of MEP \nCenters and establish an additional competitive grant program from \nwhich these centers can obtain supplemental funding for manufacturing-\nrelated projects.\n  The National Institute of Standards and Technology with its expertise \nin technology, measurement and standards helps U.S. industry \nmanufacture leading products and deliver high quality services. NIST \nhas aided U.S. companies in competing in domestic and foreign markets \nthrough technology-based innovations in areas such as biotechnology, \ninformation technology and advanced manufacturing. NIST's capabilities \nwill allow them to make further valuable contributions with emerging \ntechnologies in the future.\n  My bill establishes programs aimed at enhancing research and \nadvancements in the manufacturing industry including a fellowship \nprogram and a manufacturing research pilot program, which involves \ncost-sharing collaborations aimed at developing new processes and \nmaterials to improve manufacturing performance and productivity.\n  The Advanced Technology Program (ATP) which supports research and \ndevelopment of high-risk, cutting edge technologies is authorized \nfunding in this legislation. ATP partners with private sector entities \nto invest in early stage, innovative technologies that enable U.S. \ncompanies to develop next generation products and services that improve \nthe quality of life for all of us. These public-private partnerships \nlead to innovations that otherwise could not be developed by a single \nentity.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Manufacturing Technology \nCompetitiveness Act of 2005 and ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2134\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2137\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``All Kids Health Insurance \n     Coverage Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) There are more than 9,000,000 children in the United \n     States with no health insurance coverage.\n       (2) Uninsured children, when compared to privately insured \n     children, are --\n       (A) 3.5 times more likely to have gone without needed \n     medical, dental, or other health care;\n       (B) 4 times more likely to have delayed seeking medical \n     care;\n       (C) 5 times more likely to go without needed prescription \n     drugs; and\n       (D) 6.5 times less likely to have a regular source of care.\n       (3) Children without health insurance coverage are at a \n     disadvantage in the classroom, as shown by the following \n     studies:\n       (A) The Florida Healthy Kids Annual Report published in \n     1997, found that children who do not have health care \n     coverage are 25 percent more likely to miss school.\n       (B) A study of the California Health Families program found \n     that children enrolled in public health coverage experienced \n     a 68 percent improvement in school performance and school \n     attendance.\n       (C) A 2002 Building Bridges to Healthy Kids and Better \n     Students study conducted by the Council of Chief State School \n     Officers in Vermont concluded that children who started out \n     without health insurance saw their reading scores more than \n     double after obtaining health care coverage.\n       (4) More than half of uninsured children in the United \n     States are eligible for coverage under either the State \n     Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) or Medicaid, but \n     are not enrolled in those safety net programs.\n       (5) Some States, seeing that the Federal Government is not \n     providing assistance to middle class families who are unable \n     to afford health insurance, are trying to extend health care \n     coverage to some or all children in the State.\n       (6) State efforts to cover all children may not be \n     successful without financial assistance from the Federal \n     Government.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to prohibit racial profiling; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I will introduce the End Racial \nProfiling Act of 2005. I am proud to be joined again by my friend from \nNew Jersey, Senator Corzine, and a number of other cosponsors. It is \nfitting that this bill will be introduced in one of the final days of \nSenator Corzine's service in this body. He has been a major force in \nefforts to advance this legislation from the day he joined the Senate 4 \nyears ago.\n  Ending racial profiling in America has been a priority for me for \nmany years. I worked with the senior Senator from New Jersey, Mr. \nLautenberg, back in 1999 on a bill to collect statistics on racial \nprofiling. In 2001, in his first State of the Union address, President \nBush told the American people that ``racial profiling is wrong and we \nwill end it in America.'' He asked the Attorney General to implement a \npolicy to end racial profiling.\n  The Department of Justice released a Fact Sheet and Policy Guidance \naddressing racial profiling in 2003, stating that racial profiling is \nwrong and ineffective and perpetuates negative racial stereotypes in \nour country. Though these guidelines are helpful, they do not end \nracial profiling and they do not have the force of law. Unfortunately, \nmore than 4 years after the President's ringing endorsement of our \ngoal, racial profiling has not ended in this country.\n  I am proud today, therefore, to introduce the End Racial Profiling \nAct of 2005. This bill will do what the President promised; it will \nhelp America achieve the goal of bringing an end to racial profiling. \nThis bill bans racial profiling and requires Federal, State and local \nlaw enforcement officers to take steps to end it.\n  Racial profiling is the practice by which some law enforcement agents \nroutinely stop African Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, Arab \nAmericans and others simply because of their race, ethnicity, national \norigin, or perceived religion. Reports in States from New Jersey to \nFlorida, and Maryland to Texas all show that African Americans, \nHispanics, and members of other minority groups are being stopped by \nsome police far more often than their share of the population and the \ncrime rates for those racial categories.\n  Passing this bill is even more urgent after September 11, as we have \nseen racial profiling used against Arab and Muslim Americans or \nAmericans perceived to be Arab or Muslim. The September 11 attacks were \nhorrific, and I share the determination of many Americans that finding \nthose responsible and preventing future attacks should be this Nation's \ntop priority. This is a challenge that our country can and must meet. \nBut we need improved intelligence and law enforcement. Making \nassumptions based on racial, ethnic, or religious stereotypes will not \nprotect our nation from crime and future terrorist attacks.\n  Numerous Government studies have shown that racial profiling is \nentirely ineffective. Some police departments around the country have \nrecognized the many problems with racial profiling. In response, those \ndepartments have developed programs and policies to prevent racial \nprofiling and comply with the Department of Justice's policy guidance. \nIn my own State of Wisconsin, law enforcement officials have taken \nsteps to train police officers, improve academy training, establish \nmodel policies prohibiting racial profiling, and improve relations with \nour State's diverse communities. I applaud the efforts of Wisconsin law \nenforcement. This is excellent progress and shows widespread \nrecognition that racial profiling harms our society. But like the DOJ \npolicy guidance, local programs don't have the force of law behind \nthem. The Federal Government must step up, as President Bush promised. \nThe Government must play a vital role in protecting civil rights and \nacting as a model for State and local law enforcement.\n  Now, perhaps more than ever before, our Nation cannot afford to waste \nprecious law enforcement resources or alienate Americans by tolerating \ndiscriminatory practices. It is past time for Congress and the \nPresident to enact comprehensive Federal legislation that will end \nracial profiling once and for all.\n  In clear language, the End Racial Profiling Act of 2005 bans racial \nprofiling. It defines racial profiling in terms that are consistent \nwith the Department of Justice's Policy Guidance. But this bill does \nmore than prohibit and define racial profiling--it gives law \nenforcement agencies and officers the tools necessary to end the \nharmful practice. For that reason, the End Racial Profiling Act of 2005 \nis a pro-law enforcement bill.\n  This bill will allow the Justice Department or individuals the \nability to enforce the prohibition by filing a suit for injunctive \nrelief. The bill would also require Federal, State, and local law \nenforcement agencies to adopt policies prohibiting racial profiling, \nimplement effective complaint procedures or create independent auditor \nprograms, implement disciplinary procedures for officers who engage in \nthe practice, and collect data on stops. In addition, it requires the \nAttorney General to report to Congress so Congress and the American \npeople can monitor whether the steps outlined in the bill to prevent \nand end racial profiling have been effective.\n  Like the bills introduced in past Congresses, this bill also \nauthorizes the Attorney General to provide incentive grants to help law \nenforcement comply with the ban on racial profiling, including funds to \nconduct training of police officers or purchase in-car video cameras.\n  This year's bill makes one significant improvement to ERPA. In past \nproposals, DOJ grants for State, local, and\n\n[[Page S13805]]\n\ntribal law enforcement agencies were tied to the agency having some \nkind of procedure for handling complaints of racial profiling. This \nyear, at the suggestion of experts in the field, the bill requires law \nenforcement agencies to adopt either an administrative complaint \nprocedure or an independent auditor program to be eligible for DOJ \ngrants. The Attorney General must promulgate regulations that set out \nthe types of procedures and audit programs that will be sufficient. We \nbelieve that the independent auditor option will be preferable for many \nlocal law enforcement agencies. And such programs have proven to be an \neffective way to discourage racial profiling. Also, under this year's \nbill, the Attorney General is required to conduct a 2-year \ndemonstration project to help law enforcement agencies with data \ncollection.\n  Let me emphasize that local, State, and Federal law enforcement \nagents play a vital role in protecting the public from crime and \nprotecting the Nation from terrorism. The vast majority of law \nenforcement agents nationwide discharge their duties professionally and \nwithout bias and we are all indebted to them for their courage and \ndedication. This bill should not be misinterpreted as a criticism of \nthose who put their lives on the line for the rest of us every day. \nRather, it is a statement that the use of race, ethnicity, religion, or \nnational origin in deciding which persons should be subject to traffic \nstops, stops and frisks, questioning, searches, and seizures is wrong \nand ineffective, except where there is specific information linking \npersons of a particular race, ethnicity, religion, or national origin \nto a crime.\n  The provisions in this bill will help restore the trust and \nconfidence of the communities that our law enforcement have pledged to \nserve and protect. That confidence is crucial to our success in \nstopping crime and in stopping terrorism. The End Racial Profiling Act \nof 2005 is good for law enforcement and good for America.\n  I urge the President to make good on his pledge to end racial \nprofiling, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the End \nRacial Profiling Act of 2005.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2138\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS, PURPOSES, AND INTENT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Federal, State, and local law enforcement agents play a \n     vital role in protecting the public from crime and protecting \n     the Nation from terrorism. The vast majority of law \n     enforcement agents nationwide discharge their duties \n     professionally and without bias.\n       (2) The use by police officers of race, ethnicity, national \n     origin, or religion in deciding which persons should be \n     subject to traffic stops, stops and frisks, questioning, \n     searches, and seizures is improper.\n       (3) In his address to a joint session of Congress on \n     February 27, 2001, President George W. Bush declared that \n     ``racial profiling is wrong and we will end it in America.''. \n     He directed the Attorney General to implement this policy.\n       (4) In June 2003, the Department of Justice issued a Policy \n     Guidance regarding racial profiling by Federal law \n     enforcement agencies which stated: ``Racial profiling in law \n     enforcement is not merely wrong, but also ineffective. Race-\n     based assumptions in law enforcement perpetuate negative \n     racial stereotypes that are harmful to our rich and diverse \n     democracy, and materially impair our efforts to maintain a \n     fair and just society.''.\n       (5) The Department of Justice Guidance is a useful first \n     step, but does not achieve the President's stated goal of \n     ending racial profiling in America, as--\n       (A) it does not apply to State and local law enforcement \n     agencies;\n       (B) it does not contain a meaningful enforcement mechanism;\n       (C) it does not require data collection; and\n       (D) it contains an overbroad exception for immigration and \n     national security matters.\n       (6) Current efforts by State and local governments to \n     eradicate racial profiling and redress the harms it causes, \n     while also laudable, have been limited in scope and \n     insufficient to address this national problem. Therefore, \n     Federal legislation is needed.\n       (7) Statistical evidence from across the country \n     demonstrates that racial profiling is a real and measurable \n     phenomenon.\n       (8) As of November 15, 2000, the Department of Justice had \n     14 publicly noticed, ongoing, pattern or practice \n     investigations involving allegations of racial profiling and \n     had filed 5 pattern or practice lawsuits involving \n     allegations of racial profiling, with 4 of those cases \n     resolved through consent decrees.\n       (9) A large majority of individuals subjected to stops and \n     other enforcement activities based on race, ethnicity, \n     national origin, or religion are found to be law abiding and \n     therefore racial profiling is not an effective means to \n     uncover criminal activity.\n       (10) A 2001 Department of Justice report on citizen-police \n     contacts that occurred in 1999, found that, although Blacks \n     and Hispanics were more likely to be stopped and searched, \n     they were less likely to be in possession of contraband. On \n     average, searches and seizures of Black drivers yielded \n     evidence only 8 percent of the time, searches and seizures of \n     Hispanic drivers yielded evidence only 10 percent of the \n     time, and searches and seizures of White drivers yielded \n     evidence 17 percent of the time.\n       (11) A 2000 General Accounting Office report on the \n     activities of the United States Customs Service during fiscal \n     year 1998 found that--\n       (A) Black women who were United States citizens were 9 \n     times more likely than White women who were United States \n     citizens to be x-rayed after being frisked or patted down;\n       (B) Black women who were United States citizens were less \n     than half as likely as White women who were United States \n     citizens to be found carrying contraband; and\n       (C) in general, the patterns used to select passengers for \n     more intrusive searches resulted in women and minorities \n     being selected at rates that were not consistent with the \n     rates of finding contraband.\n       (12) A 2005 report of the Bureau of Justice Statistics of \n     the Department of Justice on citizen-police contacts that \n     occurred in 2002, found that, although Whites, Blacks, and \n     Hispanics were stopped by the police at the same rate--\n       (A) Blacks and Hispanics were much more likely to be \n     arrested than Whites;\n       (B) Hispanics were much more likely to be ticketed than \n     Blacks or Whites;\n       (C) Blacks and Hispanics were much more likely to report \n     the use or threatened use of force by a police officer;\n       (D) Blacks and Hispanics were much more likely to be \n     handcuffed than Whites; and\n       (E) Blacks and Hispanics were much more likely to have \n     their vehicles searched than Whites.\n       (13) In some jurisdictions, local law enforcement \n     practices, such as ticket and arrest quotas and similar \n     management practices, may have the unintended effect of \n     encouraging law enforcement agents to engage in racial \n     profiling.\n       (14) Racial profiling harms individuals subjected to it \n     because they experience fear, anxiety, humiliation, anger, \n     resentment, and cynicism when they are unjustifiably treated \n     as criminal suspects. By discouraging individuals from \n     traveling freely, racial profiling impairs both interstate \n     and intrastate commerce.\n       (15) Racial profiling damages law enforcement and the \n     criminal justice system as a whole by undermining public \n     confidence and trust in the police, the courts, and the \n     criminal law.\n       (16) In the wake of the September 11, 2001, terrorist \n     attacks, many Arabs, Muslims, Central and South Asians, and \n     Sikhs, as well as other immigrants and Americans of foreign \n     descent, were treated with generalized\n\n[[Page S13806]]\n\n     suspicion and subjected to searches and seizures based upon \n     religion and national origin, without trustworthy information \n     linking specific individuals to criminal conduct. Such \n     profiling has failed to produce tangible benefits, yet has \n     created a fear and mistrust of law enforcement agencies in \n     these communities.\n       (17) Racial profiling violates the equal protection clause \n     of the fourteenth amendment to the Constitution of the United \n     States. Using race, ethnicity, religion, or national origin \n     as a proxy for criminal suspicion violates the constitutional \n     requirement that police and other government officials accord \n     to all citizens the equal protection of the law. Batson v. \n     Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986); Palmore v. Sidoti, 466 U.S. 429 \n     (1984).\n       (18) Racial profiling is not adequately addressed through \n     suppression motions in criminal cases for 2 reasons. First, \n     the Supreme Court held, in Whren v. United States, 517 U.S. \n     806 (1996), that the racially discriminatory motive of a \n     police officer in making an otherwise valid traffic stop does \n     not warrant the suppression of evidence under the fourth \n     amendment to the Constitution of the United States. Second, \n     since most stops do not result in the discovery of \n     contraband, there is no criminal prosecution and no evidence \n     to suppress.\n       (19) A comprehensive national solution is needed to address \n     racial profiling at the Federal, State, and local levels. \n     Federal support is needed to combat racial profiling through \n     specialized training of law enforcement agents, improved \n     management systems, and the acquisition of technology such as \n     in-car video cameras.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to enforce the constitutional right to equal protection \n     of the laws, pursuant to the fifth amendment and section 5 of \n     the fourteenth amendment to the Constitution of the United \n     States;\n       (2) to enforce the constitutional right to protection \n     against unreasonable searches and seizures, pursuant to the \n     fourteenth amendment to the Constitution of the United \n     States;\n       (3) to enforce the constitutional right to interstate \n     travel, pursuant to section 2 of article IV of the \n     Constitution of the United States; and\n       (4) to regulate interstate commerce, pursuant to clause 3 \n     of section 8 of article I of the Constitution of the United \n     States.\n       (c) Intent.--This Act is not intended to and should not \n     impede the ability of Federal, State, and local law \n     enforcement to protect the country and its people from any \n     threat, be it foreign or domestic.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I rise to in support of the End Racial \nProfiling Act a bill being introduced today by Senators Feingold, Obama \nand myself. This bill addresses an issue that is critical to the people \nof my home State of New Jersey and to all Americans.\n  I start by recognizing two of my colleagues with whom I have been \nworking to address the problem of racial profiling. Senator Russ \nFeingold has been a tremendous leader on this issue he held the first \nSenate hearings on racial profiling in 2001, and he and his staff have \nworked tirelessly to elevate the importance of this issue as a matter \nof civil rights. I also want to recognize Senator Obama he has been a \nconstant champion of efforts to combat racial profiling. Senator Obama \ntook the lead in writing one of the Nation's most innovative pieces of \nlegislation on the collection of racial profiling data when he was in \nthe Illinois State Senate, and he has been equally committed to the \nissue since joining the U.S. Senate. Both Senators Feingold and Obama \nhave worked tirelessly to make the bill we are introducing today a \nreality.\n  Racial profiling is anathema to the principles on which our Nation \nwas founded, sowing division within our communities and striking at the \nheart of our democratic values.\n  Stopping people on our highways, our streets, and at our borders \nbecause of the color of their skin is simply wrong, and it is \nincompatible with the fundamental American belief in fairness, justice, \nand equal protection under the law.\n  Every American is entitled to equal protection under the law. Our \nConstitution tolerates nothing less, and we should demand nothing less.\n  There is no equal protection there is no equal justice if law \nenforcement agencies engage in policies and practices that are premised \non a theory that the way to stop crime is to go after minorities on the \nhunch that they are more likely to be criminals.\n  Let me add that not only is racial profiling wrong, it is simply not \nan effective law enforcement tool. There is no evidence that stopping \npeople of color adds up to catching the ``bad guys.''\n  In fact, empirical evidence shows that singling out Black motorists \nor Hispanic motorists for stops and searches doesn't lead to a higher \npercentage of arrests because minority motorists are no more likely to \nbreak the law than white motorists.\n  What is more, the practice of racial profiling actually undermines \npublic\n\n[[Page S13809]]\n\nsafety, by contributing to the perception in minority neighborhoods \nthat the criminal justice system is unfair, and eroding the trust \nbetween communities and the police that is so essential to effective \nlaw enforcement.\n  Nonetheless, racial profiling persists.\n  Unfortunately, the practice is real and widespread throughout the \nNation.\n  A 2005 report of the Department of Justice found that Blacks and \nHispanics throughout the Nation were much more likely to be handcuffed \nand have their cars searched by law enforcement during traffic stops, \neven though they were less likely to be harboring contraband.\n  A Government Accountability Office report on the U.S. Customs Service \nreleased in March 2000 found that Black, Asian, and Hispanic women were \nfour to nine times more likely than White women to be subjected to \nxrays after being frisked or patted down.\n  But on the basis of the xray results, Black women were less than half \nas likely as White women to be found carrying contraband.\n  This is law enforcement by hunch. No warrants. No probable cause.\n  And what is the hunch based on?\n  Race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion plain and simple. And \nthat is plain wrong.\n  Now--we know that many law enforcement agencies, including some from \nmy home state, have acknowledged the danger of the practice and have \ntaken steps to combat it. I commend them for their efforts.\n  That said, it is clear that this is a national problem that requires \na Federal response applicable to all.\n  Our legislation is a strong but measured response to the destructive \nproblem of racial profiling.\n  First, it defines racial profiling and bans it.\n  Racial profiling is defined in the bill to include routine or \nspontaneous investigatory stops based on race, ethnicity, national \norigin, or religion. This conduct is wrong and must be stopped. The \nPresident and the Attorney General have said just that. The legislation \nwould be the first Federal statute to prohibit this practice at the \nFederal, State, and local level.\n  To guarantee that the statute does not impede legitimate and \nresponsible policing, the statute is careful to exclude from the ban on \nracial profiling those cases where there is trustworthy information \nthat links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national origin, \nor religion to a particular crime.\n  Our bill also gives the ban on racial profiling teeth by allowing the \nDepartment of Justice or an individual harmed by racial profiling to \nobtain declaratory or injunctive relief from a court if the Government \ndoes not take steps to end racial profiling.\n  Next, the statute will require the collection of statistical data to \nmeasure whether progress is being made. By collecting this data we will \nget a fair and honest picture of law enforcement at work. And we will \nprovide law enforcement agencies with the information they need to \ndetect problems early on.\n  Our bill directs the Attorney General to develop standards for data \ncollection and instructs the Attorney General to consult with law \nenforcement and other stakeholders in developing those standards. It \nalso specifically directs the Attorney General to establish standards \nfor setting benchmarks against which the collected data should be \nmeasured so that no data is taken out of context, as some in law \nenforcement rightly fear. Finally, we will require the Bureau of \nJustice Statistics in the Department of Justice to analyze these \nstatistics on an annual basis so that the Nation can gauge the success \nof its efforts to combat this corrosive practice.\n  Finally, we will encourage a change in law enforcement culture \nthrough the use of the carrot and the stick.\n  First, the carrot: We recognize that law enforcement shouldn't be \nexpected to do this alone. So this bill says that if you do the job \nright fairly and equitably you are eligible to receive development \ngrants to help pay for the following: Advanced training programs; \ncomputer technology to help collect data and statistics; video cameras \nand recorders for patrol cars; establishing or improving systems for \nhandling complaints alleging ethnic or racial profiling; and \nestablishing management systems to ensure that supervisors are held \naccountable for the conduct of subordinates.\n  Further, we will direct the Attorney General to conduct a \ndemonstration project that will give grants to police departments to \nhelp them collect racial profiling data and then work with an \ninstitution of higher learning to analyze the collect data.\n  But if law enforcement agencies don't do the job right, there is also \nthe stick. Our bill will require law enforcement agencies to put in \nplace procedures to receive and investigate complaints alleging racial \nprofiling. The bill gives the law enforcement agencies the flexibility \nand the options to adopt the procedures that best fit the needs of \ntheir local communities. Further, the bill permits localities to \ncooperate with other communities and with the State in which they are \nlocated to develop shared procedures to invest racial profiling \nproblems in the community.\n  If State and local law enforcement agencies refuse to implement \nprocedures to end and prevent profiling, they will be subject to a loss \nof Federal law enforcement funds.\n  Let me be clear this bill is not about blaming law enforcement. Most \nlaw enforcement officers discharge their duties responsibly. But \nstopping people based solely on race, ethnicity, national origin, or \nreligion will be outlawed.\n  We have introduced two bills in the last 5 years to eliminate racial \nprofiling. The President of the United States has condemned racial \nprofiling in his State of the Union address. There is a broad and \nbipartisan consensus that it is an unfair and destructive practice. And \nyet we have failed to act.\n  In the meantime, racial profiling has continued to breed humiliation, \nanger, resentment, and cynicism throughout this country.\n  It has weakened respect for the law by everyone, not just those \noffended.\n  Simply put it is wrong and we must finally end it. Today we pledge to \ndo just that to define it, to ban it, and to enforce this ban.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 2139. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nsimplify the earned income tax credit eligibility requirements \nregarding filing status, presence of children, investment income, and \nwork and immigrant status; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the \nEarned Income Tax Credit Simplification Act. This legislation will \ngreatly improve one of our Nation's most important antipoverty programs \nand streamline one of the most complicated sections of our income tax \ncode. And I am extremely pleased that my good friend from Maine, \nSenator Olympia Snowe, has agreed to be an original cosponsor of this \nbill. I look forward to working with her, as members of the Senate \nFinance Committee, to enact this important tax simplification proposal.\n  In 2003, almost 21 million hard-working Americans benefited from the \nearned income tax credit, including 141,707 in my own State of West \nVirginia. Many of those serving in our Armed Forces benefit from the \nEITC. The EITC rewards hard work and helps these families make ends \nmeet. However, the eligibility criteria for claiming the credit are so \ncomplicated that many people legitimately entitled to benefit from the \ncredit do not even realize it. And unfortunately, too many erroneous \nclaims occur. The tax credit should not be so complicated that cash-\nstrapped families need the help of an accountant to file their taxes.\n  The Earned Income Tax Credit Simplification Act would make four \nimportant changes to the eligibility requirements of the credit. First, \nit would simplify the ``abandoned spouse'' rule so that custodial \nparents who are separated but not divorced would be able to claim the \ncredit. Second, it would allow a taxpayer living in the same house with \na qualifying child but not claiming that child for the EITC benefit to \nqualify for EITC benefits available to taxpayers without children. \nThird, the bill would eliminate the qualifying investment income test \nfor EITC claimants. Finally, the bill would make sure that only \nimmigrants who comply with all of the immigration rules would qualify \nfor the EITC, preventing people who are not allowed to\n\n[[Page S13810]]\n\nwork in the United States from claiming the credit.\n  These are commonsense reforms based on recommendations in the budget \nsubmitted to Congress by the Bush administration. I hope that they can \nbe enacted quickly so that taxpayers whom Congress intended to help \nwith the EITC will be able to claim the benefits without unnecessary \nand intimidating paperwork. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues to enact this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      BY Mr. HATCH (for himself and Mr. Brownback):\n  S. 2140. A bill to enhance protection of children from sexual \nexploitation by strengthening section 2257 of title 18, United States \nCode, requiring producers of sexually explicit material to keep and \npermit inspection of records regarding the age of performers, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, joined by my friend from Kansas, Senator \nBrownback, I am today introducing the Protecting Children from Sexual \nExploitation Act of 2005.\n  This bill will strengthen an important tool for protecting children \nfrom the exploitation of child pornography.\n  Pornography is devastating communities, families, and individual \nlives.\n  On November 10, the Senator from Kansas chaired a hearing in the \nJudiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution titled ``Why the Government \nShould Care About Pornography.''\n  Witnesses at that hearing included authors and researchers \ndocumenting the devastation wrought by pornography.\n  Children are pornography's most vulnerable and most devastated \nvictims.\n  Abusing children through early exposure to pornography has lifelong \neffects.\n  Even worse, however, is the actual use of children to make sexually \nexplicit material.\n  This is perhaps the worst form of sexual exploitation because the \nabuse only begins with its production.\n  Children lack the maturity to choose participation in that activity \nand to accept its aftermath.\n  Everyone who intentionally copies, distributes, advertises, \npurchases, or consumes sexually explicit material involving children \nshould be held responsible as part of the ongoing chain of \nexploitation.\n  For this compelling reason, Federal law prohibits using children to \nproduce visual depictions of either actual or simulated sexually \nexplicit conduct.\n  As an additional deterrent to this abhorrent practice, Federal law \nalso requires those who produce sexually explicit material to keep \nrecords regarding the age of performers and to make those records \navailable for inspection.\n  That recordkeeping statute is found in the United States Code in \nsection 2257 of title 18.\n  Section 2257 is inadequate for its crucial task and the bill I \nintroduce today strengthens it in four ways.\n  First, section 2257 defines actual sexually explicit conduct too \nnarrowly, incorporating only four of the five. part definition found \nright next door in the definitional section 2256.\n  Our bill makes these definitions consistent.\n  Second, and more importantly, while Federal law prohibits using \nchildren to make depictions of either actual or simulated sexually \nexplicit conduct, section 2257 applies only to those who produce \ndepictions of actual conduct.\n  Our bill applies the same recordkeeping requirements to those who \nproduce depictions of simulated conduct.\n  The purpose is obvious.\n  If you produce sexually explicit material, you have to keep age-\nrelated records.\n  Period.\n  Third, while section 2257 requires maintaining records and making \nthem available for inspection, it only makes unlawful failure to \nmaintain the records.\n  This implies that while making these important records available for \ninspection is a duty, refusing to do so is not a crime.\n  Our bill corrects that error by explicitly stating that refusal to \npermit inspection of these records is also a crime.\n  Eliminating such ambiguity is very important.\n  Maintaining records is necessary, but not sufficient, to ensure that \nchildren are not being exploited.\n  Because inspection of those records makes the circle of protection \ncomplete, we must make crystal clear that refusal to permit inspections \nis a crime.\n  Fourth, the definition in section 2257 of what it means to produce \nsexually explicit material is inadequate.\n  That definition must be guided by the nature of the harm that flows \nfrom this kind of sexual exploitation.\n  Filming or taking a picture of a child engaged in sexually explicit \nconduct is certainly sexual exploitation by itself.\n  But the abuse does not end there.\n  Those whose actions constitute links in the chain of exploitation \nmust be covered by this recordkeeping statute if it is to be an \neffective tool to protect children.\n  My friend from Kansas, Senator Brownback, graciously allowed me to \nparticipate in the latest hearing in his subcommittee on the effects of \npornography.\n  Witnesses highlighted how new technology can magnify those effects.\n  While the Internet can be a powerful tool for good, it can also be an \ninsidious tool for evil.\n  It can compound the sexual exploitation of children by disseminating \nand commercializing child pornography.\n  And while we all know how difficult it is for sound public policy to \nkeep pace with developing and changing technology, failing to do so in \nthis area leaves children even more exposed to ongoing victimization \nand exploitation.\n  For that reason, our bill provides both a substantive definition of \nthat important term, ``produces,'' and lists five targeted exceptions, \nfive specific categories of those who are not included in this \ndefinition.\n  The definition includes obvious activities such as filming or \nphotographing someone but also activities such as duplicating or \nreissuing images for commercial distribution.\n  It also includes managing the sexually explicit content of a computer \nsite.\n  At the same time, our bill does not include in the definition of the \nterm ``produces'' activities that do not involve the hiring, managing, \nor arranging for the performers' participation.\n  It exempts provision of Web-hosting services when the provider does \nnot manage sexually explicit content.\n  In strengthening section 2257, the bill we are introducing today \nmeets three important objectives.\n  First and foremost, this bill will make the recordkeeping statute a \nmore effective tool for protecting children from sexual exploitation.\n  Second, our bill strengthens the recordkeeping statute while \nminimizing unintended consequences.\n  I mentioned the care with which our bill defines key terms such as \n``produces.''\n  Our bill also places the extension of recordkeeping requirements \nregarding depictions of simulated material in a separate section 2257A.\n  This step responded to a legitimate concern by the motion picture \nindustry.\n  Third, our bill strengthens the recordkeeping statute in ways that \nmake it a more workable and practical tool for the prosecutors who have \nto use it.\n  I believe that as the Congress deals with this difficult issue, we \nmust keep all three of these objectives in mind.\n  Some might want to create a draconian statute that sweeps too \nbroadly.\n  Others may want to water down the statute in ways that create \nobstacles for prosecutors and make the statute ineffective.\n  My bill strengthens this important tool for protecting children \nwithout sweeping too broadly and without needlessly hobbling \nprosecutors.\n  Finally, let me say just a few things about the process leading up to \nintroduction of this bill today.\n  Two versions of this bill have been introduced in the other body, \nmost recently last week as title VI of H.R.4472, the Children's Safety \nand Violent Crime Reduction Act of 2005.\n  Representatives of the motion picture industry and Internet companies \nhave been working with us to refine this legislation.\n  I also commend my colleagues in the House, Representative Mike Pence \nand Chairman Jim Sensenbrenner, for their leadership on this issue.\n  In addition, the Department of Justice has provided valuable input in \nthis\n\n[[Page S13811]]\n\nprocess. I applaud Attorney General Gonzales for making the prosecution \nof obscenity, child pornography, and other forms of child exploitation \na real priority.\n  I understand that the Attorney General today announced arrests in \nseveral States as part of its Innocence Lost initiative against child \nprostitution.\n  I want to be very clear here.\n  Those who produce either actual or simulated sexually explicit \nmaterial are breaking the law if that material depicts children.\n  The primary goal of protecting those children from such exploitation \nrequires that all producers of sexually explicit material must keep \nage-related records, make those records available for inspection, and \nface criminal penalties if they refuse.\n  We have taken several concrete steps to respond to legitimate \nconcerns from the motion picture industry and Internet companies.\n  We have already modified our bill several times and in several ways \nas a response to our meetings with the Department of Justice and \naffected parties.\n  We remain open to making further refinements in this language if it \nwill strengthen the bill.\n  But that process of compromise must stop if it undermines the primary \nobjective of protecting children from sexual exploitation or begins to \nmake the statute unenforceable or feckless.\n  I hope that those who are affected by this legislation and have \nparticipated in helping us craft this bill will demonstrate their \nconcern for protecting children by supporting this straighforward and \ncommonsense bill.\n  Again, I want to thank my friend from Kansas for joining me in \ncosponsoring this bill and for his efforts in this area.\n  I hope all my colleagues will join us in strengthening this tool for \nprotecting children.\n                                  ____\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I applaud my colleague from Utah for \nhelping lead the fight against child pornography. This is an issue upon \nwhich all Senators can unite, and it is a battle we must not lose.\n  Pornography is no longer isolated to a small segment of society. It \nhas pervaded our culture. As we learned in a recent hearing I chaired \nin the Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and \nProperty Rights, pornography has infiltrated homes and families and is \nhaving devastating effects. According to recent reports, 1 in 5 \nchildren between the ages of 10 and 17 have received a sexual \nsolicitation over the Internet, and 9 out of 10 children between the \nages of 8 and 16 who have Internet access have viewed porn Web sites, \nusually in the course of looking up information for homework.\n  Perhaps the ugliest aspect of the pornography epidemic is child \npornography. Children as young as 5 years old are being used for profit \nin this fast-growing industry. We have a duty to protect the weakest \nmembers of our society from exploitation and abuse. I believe this bill \nis the first step in that fight.\n  First, this bill will expand recordkeeping requirements to those who \nproduce soft-core, or simulated, pornography. Current law only requires \nthat records be kept by producers of hardcore, or actual, pornography. \nUnder this language, producers will now be required to verify the ages \nof their actors and keep records of such information, regardless of \nwhether the material they produce contains actual sexual activity or \nonly a simulation of such activity. Further, this bill will require \nproducers of such materials to disclose such records to the Attorney \nGeneral for inspection. It will make refusal to permit inspection of \nsuch records a crime. This will be effective not only as a tool in \nprosecutions as a means of deterrence. Producers will be less likely to \nuse child actors if they know they may be required to disclose the ages \nof their actors.\n  Today, recordkeeping requirements apply only to ``actual'' sexual \nconduct, leaving a loophole for soft-core pornography. Such material is \nno less damaging to children than hardcore pornography and \nrecordkeeping and disclosure requirements must apply to this material \nas well. This bill will close the current loophole.\n  Again, I appreciate the leadership of Senator Hatch, and I hope my \ncolleagues will join us passing this legislation to protect children \nfrom victimization and abuse.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/16/senate-section/article/S13811-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13811]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 335--HONORING MEMBERS OF THE RADIATION PROTECTION \n PROFESSION BY DESIGNATING THE WEEK OF NOVEMBER 6 THROUGH NOVEMBER 12, \n     2005, AS ``NATIONAL RADIATION PROTECTION PROFESSIONALS WEEK.''\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI submitted the following resolution; which was referred \nto the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

Res. 72\n\n       Whereas, in the year 2005, the people of the world suffered \n     many calamitous events, including devastation from tsunami, \n     terror attacks, war, famine, genocide, hurricanes, \n     earthquakes, political and religious conflict, disease, \n     poverty, and rioting, all necessitating global cooperation, \n     compassion, and unity previously unprecedented among diverse \n     cultures, faiths, and economic classes;\n       Whereas grave global challenges in the year 2006 may \n     require cooperation and innovative problem solving among \n     citizens and nations on an even greater scale;\n       Whereas, on December 15, 2000, Congress adopted Senate \n     Concurrent Resolution 138, expressing the sense of Congress \n     that the President of the United States should issue a \n     proclamation each year calling upon the people of the United \n     States and interested organizations to observe an \n     international day of peace and sharing at the beginning of \n     each year;\n       Whereas, in 2001, the United Nations General Assembly \n     adopted Resolution 56/2, which invited ``Member States, \n     intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and all \n     the peoples of the world to celebrate One Day in Peace, 1 \n     January 2002, and every year thereafter'';\n       Whereas many foreign heads of state have recognized the \n     importance of establishing Global Family Day, a special day \n     of international unity, peace, and sharing, on the first day \n     of each year;\n       Whereas Congress desires to express and demonstrate its \n     appreciation to the citizens of the more than 100 countries \n     who offered aid to United States hurricane victims, to make \n     tangible efforts to reverse the growing mistrust of the \n     United States, and to improve relations with others; and\n       Whereas family is the basic structure of humanity, and we \n     must all look to the stability and love within our individual \n     families to create stability in the global community: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress urgently requests the following:\n       (1) That the President issue a proclamation annually \n     calling upon the people of the United States to observe \n     Global Family Day, One Day of Peace and Sharing, a day which \n     is dedicated--\n       (A) to eradicating violence, hunger, poverty, and \n     suffering; and\n       (B) to establishing greater trust and fellowship among \n     peace-loving nations and families everywhere.\n       (2) That the President invite former Presidents of the \n     United States, Nobel laureates, and other notables, including \n     business, labor, faith, and civic leaders of the United \n     States, to join the President in promoting appropriate \n     activities for the people of the United States and in \n     extending appropriate greetings from the families of the \n     United States to families in the rest of the world.\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to submit a Senate Concurrent \nResolution\n\n[[Page S13857]]\n\nrequesting the President to issue a proclamation annually calling upon \nthe people of the United States to observe Global Family Day, One Day \nof Peace and Sharing, on the first of each January. This measure is co-\nsponsored by Mr. Coleman and Mr. Kennedy.\n  The observance is dedicated to eradicating violence, hunger, poverty \nand suffering, and to establish greater trust and fellowship among \nnations and families everywhere. Global Family Day encourages families \nto reach out to each other on the first of January of each year. It is \na day for sharing the idea and condition of peace, and the observance \ncan take a concrete form such as sharing a meal or helping the needy.\n  The idea of Global Family Day originates from young supporters. In \n1999, ninety nine children from Hine Middle School in the District of \nColumbia visited Capitol Hill, asking Congress to dedicate one day each \nyear to a day of peace and sharing. In the following year, the \nfootsteps of these intrepid young thinkers were followed by children \nfrom Brent Elementary School, also from the District of Columbia. \nChildren from Stuart-Hobson Middle School also visited members of \nCongress on Capitol Hill.\n  The 106th Congress agreed with them, and in the year 2000, adopted a \nresolution similar to the one I am submitting today. However, with the \nonrush of events after the tragedy of September 11, 2001, a \nproclamation was not issued. Thus, there was little public knowledge \nthat we have this important tool for peace, despite the international \nsupport from the United Nations General Assembly. We can remedy that \ntoday by showing our support for Global Family Day.\n  Many Americans are troubled by our deteriorating image in the world, \nby the dangers of terrorism and by the suffering of others, both at \nhome and abroad. Yet they feel helpless to do anything about it. Global \nFamily Day offers a potential solution. The observance of Global Family \nDay can lead to greater understanding among faith groups, people of \ndifferent races and economic classes. Global Family Day provides a way \nin which every man, woman and child in the United States can help \nreduce suffering at home, repair our damaged image abroad, and help us \nremember that in the end, all peoples belong to the same family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/16/senate-section/article/S13857-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13857]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 73--URGING THE PRESIDENT TO ISSUE A \n  PROCLAMATION FOR THE OBSERVANCE OF AN AMERICAN JEWISH HISTORY MONTH\n\n  Mr. SPECTER submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 73\n\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress urges the President to issue each \n     year a proclamation calling on State and local governments \n     and the people of the United States to observe an American \n     Jewish History Month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, \n     and activities.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this year marked the 350th anniversary of \nJewish life in America. The occasion has been commemorated with \nfestivities and celebrations across the entire country. As this special \nyear draws to a close, I am submitting a resolution urging the \nPresident to establish permanent recognition of the contributions the \nJewish culture has made to life in America by annually issuing a \nproclamation for the observance of an American Jewish History Month.\n  Each year, we remember the achievements and contributions made by \nAfrican-Americans and women to our Nation's development by designating \nFebruary as African American History Month and March as Women's History \nMonth. Similarly, Jewish American History Month would celebrate the \nlegacy of the American Jewish experience and observe the many \ncontributions Jewish-Americans have made in the areas of medicine, the \narts, science, and technology.\n  American society is comprised of many cultures. Americans are proud \nof our history of acceptance and understanding. By establishing a \nJewish American History Month, we will present an additional \nopportunity to raise our Nation's cultural awareness and celebrate our \ndiversity.\n  An identical resolution was introduced in the House by Congresswoman \nWasserman Schultz, where it was cosponsored by 250 Members and passed \nunanimously.\n  I hope that the Senate will join our colleagues in the House by \nagreeing to this resolution, urging the President to annually issue a \nproclamation for the observance of an American Jewish History Month.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/16/senate-section/article/S13857-2", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13857]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2680.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Nearly \\1/3\\ of American women report physical or \n     sexual abuse by a husband or boyfriend at some point in their \n     lives.\n       (2) According to the National Crime Victimization Survey, \n     248,000 Americans 12 years of age and older were raped or \n     sexually assaulted in 2002.\n       (3) Rape and sexual assault in the United States is \n     estimated to cost $127,000,000,000 per year, including--\n       (A) lost productivity;\n       (B) medical and mental health care;\n       (C) police and fire services;\n       (D) social services;\n       (E) loss of and damage to property; and\n       (F) reduced quality of life.\n       (4) Nonreporting of sexual assault in rural areas is a \n     particular problem because of the high rate of nonstranger \n     sexual assault.\n       (5) Geographic isolation often compounds the problems \n     facing sexual assault victims. The lack of anonymity and \n     accessible support services can limit opportunities for \n     justice for victims.\n       (6) Domestic elder abuse is primarily family abuse. The \n     National Elder Abuse Incidence Study found that the \n     perpetrator was a family member in 90 percent of cases.\n       (7) Barriers for older victims leaving abusive \n     relationships include--\n       (A) the inability to support themselves;\n       (B) poor health that increases their dependence on the \n     abuser;\n       (C) fear of being placed in a nursing home; and\n       (D) ineffective responses by domestic abuse programs and \n     law enforcement.\n       (8) Disabled women comprise another vulnerable population \n     with unmet needs. Women with disabilities are more likely to \n     be the victims of abuse and violence than women without \n     disabilities because of their increased physical, economic, \n     social, or psychological dependence on others.\n       (9) Many women with disabilities also fail to report the \n     abuse, since they are dependent on their abusers and fear \n     being abandoned or institutionalized.\n       (10) Of the 598 battered women's programs surveyed--\n       (A) only 35 percent of these programs offered disability \n     awareness training for their staff; and\n       (B) only 16 percent dedicated a staff member to provide \n     services to women with disabilities.\n       (11) Problems of domestic violence are exacerbated for \n     immigrants when spouses control the immigration status of \n     their family members, and abusers use threats of refusal to \n     file immigration papers and threats to deport spouses and \n     children as powerful tools to prevent battered immigrant \n     women from seeking help, trapping battered immigrant women in \n     violent homes because of fear of deportation.\n       (12) Battered immigrant women who attempt to flee abusive \n     relationships may not have access to bilingual shelters or \n     bilingual professionals, and face restrictions on public or \n     financial assistance. They may also lack assistance of a \n     certified interpreter in court, when reporting complaints to \n     the police or a 9-1-1 operator, or even in acquiring \n     information about their rights and the legal system.\n       (13) More than 500 men and women call the National Domestic \n     Violence Hotline every day to get immediate, informed, and \n     confidential assistance to help deal with family violence.\n       (14) The National Domestic Violence Hotline service is \n     available, toll-free, 24 hours a day and 7 days a week, with \n     bilingual staff, access to translators in 150 languages, and \n     a TTY line for the hearing-impaired.\n       (15) With access to over 5,000 shelters and service \n     providers across the United States, Puerto Rico, and the \n     United States Virgin\n\n[[Page S13886]]\n\n     Islands, the National Domestic Violence Hotline provides \n     crisis intervention and immediately connects callers with \n     sources of help in their local community.\n       (16) Approximately 60 percent of the callers indicate that \n     calling the Hotline is their first attempt to address a \n     domestic violence situation and that they have not called the \n     police or any other support services.\n       (17) Between 2000 and 2003, there was a 27 percent increase \n     in call volume at the National Domestic Violence Hotline.\n       (18) Improving technology infrastructure at the National \n     Domestic Violence Hotline and training advocates, volunteers, \n     and other staff on upgraded technology will drastically \n     increase the Hotline's ability to answer more calls quickly \n     and effectively.\n\n     SEC. 202.

They often do not have access to money, transportation, \n     or shelter services. They must overcome issues such as \n     distrust of adults, lack of knowledge about available \n     resources, or pressure from peers and parents.\n       (5) A needs assessment on teen relationship abuse for the \n     State of California, funded by the California Department of \n     Health Services, identified a desire for confidentiality and \n     confusion about the law as 2 of the most significant barriers \n     to young victims of domestic and dating violence seeking \n     help.\n       (6) Only one State specifically allows for minors to \n     petition the court for protection orders.\n       (7) Many youth are involved in dating relationships, and \n     these relationships can include the same kind of domestic \n     violence and dating violence seen in the adult population. In \n     fact, more than 40 percent of all incidents of domestic \n     violence involve people who are not married.\n       (8) 40 percent of girls ages 14 to 17 report knowing \n     someone their age who has been hit or beaten by a boyfriend, \n     and 13 percent of college women report being stalked.\n       (9) Of college women who said they had been the victims of \n     rape or attempted rape, 12.8 percent of completed rapes, 35 \n     percent of attempted rapes, and 22.9 percent of threatened \n     rapes took place on a date. Almost 60 percent of the \n     completed rapes that occurred on campus took place in the \n     victim's residence.\n       (10) According to a 3-year study of student-athletes at 10 \n     Division I universities, male athletes made up only 3.3 \n     percent of the general male university population, but they \n     accounted for 19 percent of the students reported for sexual \n     assault and 35 percent of domestic violence perpetrators.\n\n     SEC. 302.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The health-related costs of intimate partner violence \n     in the United States exceed $5,800,000,000 annually.\n       (2) Thirty-seven percent of all women who sought care in \n     hospital emergency rooms for violence-related injuries were \n     injured by a current or former spouse, boyfriend, or \n     girlfriend.\n       (3) In addition to injuries sustained during violent \n     episodes, physical and psychological abuse is linked to a \n     number of adverse physical and mental health effects. Women \n     who have been abused are much more likely to suffer from \n     chronic pain, diabetes, depression, unintended pregnancies, \n     substance abuse and sexually transmitted infections, \n     including HIV/AIDS.\n       (4) Health plans spend an average of $1,775 more a year on \n     abused women than on general enrollees.\n       (5) Each year about 324,000 pregnant women in the United \n     States are battered by the men in their lives. This battering \n     leads to complications of pregnancy, including low weight \n     gain, anemia, infections, and first and second trimester \n     bleeding.\n       (6) Pregnant and recently pregnant women are more likely to \n     be victims of homicide than to die of any other pregnancy-\n     related cause, and evidence exists that a significant \n     proportion of all female homicide victims are killed by their \n     intimate partners.\n       (7) Children who witness domestic violence are more likely \n     to exhibit behavioral and physical health problems including \n     depression, anxiety, and violence towards peers. They are \n     also more likely to attempt suicide, abuse drugs and alcohol, \n     run away from home, engage in teenage prostitution, and \n     commit sexual assault crimes.\n       (8) Recent research suggests that women experiencing \n     domestic violence significantly increase their safety-\n     promoting behaviors over the short- and long-term when health \n     care providers screen for, identify, and provide followup \n     care and information to address the violence.\n       (9) Currently, only about 10 percent of primary care \n     physicians routinely screen for intimate partner abuse during \n     new patient visits and 9 percent routinely screen for \n     intimate partner abuse during periodic checkups.\n       (10) Recent clinical studies have proven the effectiveness \n     of a 2-minute screening for early detection of abuse of \n     pregnant women. Additional longitudinal studies have tested a \n     10-minute intervention that was proven highly effective in \n     increasing the safety of pregnant abused women. Comparable \n     research does not yet exist to support the effectiveness of \n     screening men.\n       (11) Seventy to 81 percent of the patients studied reported \n     that they would like their healthcare providers to ask them \n     privately about intimate partner violence.\n\n     SEC. 502. PURPOSE.\n\n       It is the purpose of this title to improve the health care \n     system's response to domestic violence, dating violence, \n     sexual assault, and stalking through the training and \n     education of health care providers, developing comprehensive \n     public health responses to violence against women and \n     children, increasing the number of women properly screened, \n     identified, and treated for lifetime exposure to violence, \n     and expanding research on effective interventions in the \n     health care setting.\n\n     SEC. 503.

I ask unanimous consent the Chair now lay before the \nSenate the House message to accompany S. 467, a bill to extend the \napplicability of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002.\n  The Presiding Officer laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the House of Representatives:\n  Resolved that the bill from the Senate S. 467 entitled `` An Act to \nextend the applicability of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002,'' \ndo pass with an amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, make a few remarks about final passage of \nthe Terrorism Risk Insurance Extension Act of 2005. Let me start by \nthanking Senators Sarbanes, Dodd, Shelby and Bennett for their tireless \neffort in the last several months to pass this critical piece of \nlegislation. These Senators worked through significant differences on \nthe substance of this bill and ultimately reached a compromise with the \nHouse that extends the basic structure of this important program for \nanother 2 years, and I commend them for those efforts.\n  The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, commonly referred to as TRIA, has \nproven to be an effective program that has made terrorism risk \ninsurance available to commercial propertyholders and has provided \nbusinesses meaningful access to coverage in a post-9/11 world. The \nprogram has made sure that the American economy and markets function in \nthe face of a still-present threat of a terrorist attack. In my home \nState of Nevada, large construction projects and jobs were threatened \nbecause of uncertainty in the terrorism insurance market created by \nTRIA's imminent expiration. Extending TRIA will eliminate that \nuncertainty and provide an economic backstop in the event of another \nterrorist attack in this country.\n  Our Nation's economy will be more stable now that TRIA will be \nextended, but I remind my colleagues that this legislation only extends \nthe program through the end of 2007. Fortunately, the legislation \nmandates that the President's Working Group on Financial Markets \nconsult with other stakeholders and come up with an analysis of the \nlong-term availability and affordability of terrorism risk insurance. I \nlook forward to future discussions and continued work on crafting a \npermanent solution to these problems.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in support of the \nTerrorism Risk Insurance Extension Act of 2005. This legislation \nrepresents a bipartisan, bi-cameral compromise to extend the Terrorism \nRisk Insurance Act of 2002 for 2 years, through December 31, 2007. I \nwant to take this opportunity to congratulate my colleagues, as it is \nthrough the hard work of Banking Committee Chairman Shelby and Senators \nDodd and Bennett, along with the House negotiators, led by Financial \nServices Committee Chairman Oxley and ranking member Frank, that we \nhave been able to work out this compromise and ensure that TRIA \ncontinues.\n  As I said when the Senate first considered a TRIA extension bill in \nNovember of this year, the original TRIA was designed to address the \nadverse impact on the terrorism insurance marketplace of the sudden \nlack of terrorism reinsurance after the September 11th attacks. \nReinsurance is a mechanism by which insurance companies spread their \nown risks, allowing them to write more policies; without it, insurers' \ncapacity to offer coverage for losses due to terrorism shrank \nconsiderably. By all accounts, the federal backstop provided by TRIA \nachieved its goal of making terrorism insurance coverage available and \naffordable once again. The Treasury Department reported this summer, \n``TRIA was effective in terms of the purposes it was designed to \nachieve. TRIA provided a transitional period during which insurers had \nenhanced financial capacity to write terrorism risk insurance coverage. \n. . . More generally, TRIA provided an adjustment period allowing both \ninsurers and policyholders to adjust to the post-September 11th view of \nterrorism risk.''\n  However, after the Treasury Department released its report, serious \ndisagreements emerged as to what would be the most efficient, \neffective, and equitable way to assure the continued availability of \nterrorism insurance. This is an issue that deserves careful analysis, \nwhich is why this extension bill contains a requirement for a study by \nthe President's Working Group on Financial Markets on the long-term \navailability and affordability of terrorism risk insurance. I hope that \nthis requirement will result in a thorough examination of the issues \nand will include input from all stakeholders, which will help us answer \nthe question of how to insure against terrorism over the long-term.\n  To allow time for that examination to take place, this compromise \nlegislation continues the TRIA program for 2 additional years, with \ncertain modifications, which I will briefly summarize.\n  Following the model of the extension bill passed by the Senate in \nNovember of this year, this legislation narrows the scope of the TRIA \nprogram, further targeting the program toward the types of terrorism \ninsurance that are the most difficult to provide. Under the terms of \nthe extension, the federal backstop will no longer be available for \ninsurance policies covering commercial automobiles, professional \nliability, burglary and theft, farm owners, multiple peril, and surety.\n  Just as the original TRIA did, this extension places more of the risk \non the insurance industry, and correspondingly less on the Federal \nGovernment, in each year. For example, in 2005, under the current \nprogram, the amount of terrorism losses that an insurer must cover \nbefore federal assistance becomes available is 15 percent of the \npremiums collected by that insurer in lines covered by the TRIA \nprogram. Under this extension, this ``insurance company deductible'' \nwill rise to 17.5 percent of premiums in 2006, and 20 percent of \npremiums in 2007. Moreover, the amount that insurers must pay above \ntheir deductible also increases, rising from 10 percent of losses in \n2006, to 15 percent of losses in 2007.\n  In addition to the individual insurance companies' deductible, the \ninsurance industry as a whole must cover a certain amount of losses \nbefore federal assistance becomes available. In 2005, the last year of \nthe current TRIA program, that amount is $15 billion. Under this \nlegislation, that amount will rise to $25 billion in 2006, and $27.5 \nbillion in 2007, an increase from the amounts included in the \nlegislation originally passed by the Senate in November.\n  Also, after March 31, 2006, no federal assistance will be available \nat all under the program for a terrorist attack in which total losses \ndo not exceed $50 million, a level which rises to $100 million in 2007. \nThe starting date for this increase in the trigger level is later than \nit was in the bill passed by the Senate in November, to allow the \ninsurance industry and policyholders a grace period in which to adapt \nto the new level.\n  Finally, I want to emphasize that this compromise legislation, like \nthe extension bills passed by both the Senate and the House earlier \nthis year, retains a critically important piece of the current TRIA \nprogram: the requirement that insurers make terrorism coverage \navailable to policyholders in all of the lines covered by TRIA.\n  These provisions follow the framework of the existing TRIA program, \nkeeping the federal backstop in place so that insurers will continue \nwriting terrorism policies, while placing progressively more of the \ncosts onto the industry itself. As with any compromise product, no one \nwould say that\n\n[[Page S13932]]\n\nthe legislation is perfect. But it is a serious effort to address the \nconcerns we have heard raised regarding TRIA and the potential effects \nof its expiration, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting \nit.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I express my unwavering support for S. \n467, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Revision Act of 2005, introduced by \nmy friend, Senator Dodd of Connecticut.\n  I would like to commend Senators Dodd, Bennett, Shelby, and Sarbanes \nfor getting a bill done that we can all stand here and be proud to \nsupport. A bill that is good for this country and good for the State of \nNew York.\n  At long last builders and insurers of major projects in large cities, \nparticularly New York, can breathe a sigh of relief; terrorism \ninsurance will be renewed. It never should have taken this long, but at \nleast we know this protection will be available for another 2 years.\n  We still live in America, and particularly in my city of New York, in \nthe shadow of 9/11, of the terrorism that occurred. Obviously, the \nthousands of families who have had a loved one taken from their midst \nlive with it every moment of their remaining lives, but the rest of us \nlive with it too, not only in empathy for them but also in terms of the \neconomic consequences of terrorism.\n  The bottom line is very simple, and that is, because of terrorism, \nthe insurance industry, in terms of insuring risk of large structures \nin America--whether it be large buildings that make us so proud of the \nManhattan skyline, or large arenas such as the football stadiums that \ndot America, or larger facilities such as Disneyland, Disney World, and \namusement parks--all have difficulty getting insurance.\n  Insurers are worried that if, God forbid, another terrorist act \noccurs it will be so devastating that it will put them out of business.\n  So 2 years ago, the Senate, House, and the President got together at \nsort of the end of the day, just like today, and passed terrorism risk \ninsurance.\n  It has been a large success. That no one can dispute.\n  Insurance rates have come down, terrorism insurance is available, and \ninsurance companies know if, God forbid, the worst happens there will \nbe a backstop, and they are willing to issue policies.\n  In turn, that meant developers, builders who wanted to build new \nlarge structures in America, did so, employing thousands and thousands \nof people, creating profits and new businesses as well.\n  Well today we are all here to do the right thing. Yesterday, the \nBanking Committee, of which I am member, passed unanimously a bill to \nextend the TRIA. In this bill we have kept the trigger levels \nmanageable for the policyholder community. We kept the retention levels \nat a responsible level for the private market, retaining the public/\nprivate nature of the program.\n  The bottom line is that we have made some necessary modifications to \nthe program without losing the major protections. We did not all agree \nwhat should have been in the bill. Many of us felt strongly about \nincluding Group Life and protections against nuclear, biological, \nchemical and radiological attacks. But the beauty of the process is \nthat it is a negotiation where we all give and take.\n  This bill is a good compromise.\n  The continuation of this program is vital to our Nation's economic \nstability. By passing this bill on the floor today, we will be sending \na message to the world that our financial markets will be protected. \nThat our country will be able to bounce back in the event of any \ndisruptions or financial dislocation caused by another possible \nterrorist attack.\n  It is still my strong belief that there needs to be a long-term \nsolution--a permanent program. The President has continued to say that \nwe are fighting a war on terrorism.\n  The bombing in Jordan last week, the London bombings this past July, \nand the recent threat to the New York subway system are a few examples \nof why we must continue fighting this war on terrorism.\n  It would have been my preference to get a bill that extended beyond 2 \nyears. But I am at least pleased to know that there was a serious \neffort to address this concern by including a provision to create a \ncommission that would begin to analyze the long-term availability and \naffordability of insurance for terrorism risk.\n  I would particularly like to thank Senators Dodd and Shelby for \nspecifically including the language I requested which directs the \nPresident's Working Group to analyze the long-term affordability and \navailability of coverage for chemical, nuclear, biological and \nradiological events.\n  This is an issue of great importance to many New Yorkers. Many \nretailers and business owners in Lower Manhattan are afraid of a \npossible dirty bombs attack and the availability of insurance for such \nan event. This must be addressed and right away.\n  The bottom line is that financial dislocation caused by another \npossible terrorist attack--God forbid--is too much for our country to \nrisk. I urge the entire Senate to pass this legislation today. It is \nonly right that we let the markets, let the insurance world, and, most \nof all, let jobs and construction go forth.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. DODD. Mr President, I rise to lend my strong support for \nS. 467, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Extension Act of 2005, which I \noriginally introduced with Senator Bennett and 34 cosponsors earlier \nthis year. The product before the Senate today was amended in committee \nwith the hard work and leadership of Banking Committee Chairman Shelby \nand Ranking Member Sarbanes. Additionally, S. 467 addresses many of the \nideas and concerns raised by the House in its version of the \nlegislation. I would like to thank House Financial Services Committee \nChairman Oxley and Ranking Member Frank for their hard work in finding \nconsensus on this measure.\n  I would like to commend the members on the Banking Committee: \nSenators Johnson, Reed, Schumer, Bayh, Carper, Stabenow, Corzine, \nHagel, Bunning and Dole as well as the other cosponsors of the \nlegislation for recognizing-- very early on--how important extending \nthe Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, TRIA, was to our Nation's economy and \nfor their efforts on this legislation.\n  I would also like to thank the staff who worked on this legislation, \nparticularly Sarah Kline and Steve Harris from Senator Sarbane's staff, \nMike Nielsen from Senator Bennett's staff, Alex Sternhell from my staff \nand Jim Johnson, Andrew Olmem, Mark Oesterle and Kathy Casey from \nSenator Shelby's staff.\n  Like many bills, this legislation is a document of compromise. We \nhave carefully taken into consideration the recommendations of \npolicyholders, insurers, consumers, academics, thinktanks, the Treasury \nDepartment and others to craft this important extension legislation.\n  Let me take a few brief moments to provide my colleagues with a \nlittle background on TRIA and why it needs to be extended today.\n  As a result of the tragic terrorist acts events of 9/11, we \nrepeatedly heard from businesses, large and small, from labor unions \nand manufacturers, from hospitals to hotels, from professional sports \nteams to utility companies, from insurers and the insured about the \nneed for the Federal Governmment to act to help them receive financial \nprotection from future terrorist attacks.\n  Congress listened, and we acted--creating the Terrorism Risk \nInsurance Act, TRIA.\n  In November 2002, TRIA was passed by both the House and Senate by \nsignificant margins and was signed into law. It created a 3-year \nprogram establishing a Federal backstop against catastrophic losses in \nthe property and casualty insurance marketplace.\n  And we heard an ovehelming response trom policyholders across the \ncountry--TRIA has worked. It has achieved its primary goal--continued \navailability and affordability of insurance against future terrorist \nattacks.\n  Industries as diverse as commercial real estate, shipping, \nconstruction, manufacturing, and even ``mom and pop'' retailers require \ninsurance to obtain credit, loans, and investments necessary for their \nnormal business operations. TRIA was designed to do just that--restore \n``business as usual'' in every State across our Nation.\n  I believe that the greatest indicator of the success of TRIA is what \nwe have\n\n[[Page S13933]]\n\nheard over the past 3 years since the enactment of TRIA--public outcry \nfrom businesses and workers whose livelihoods are threatened by their \ninability to purchase coverage against acts of terror.\n  Construction projects are no longer stalled, mortgages are no longer \nin doubt, jobs are no longer in jeopardy as a result of the inability \nto receive terrorism insurance.\n  Not only has TRIA been effective in ensuring that terrorism is \navailable and affordable, and that our economy remains vibrant, it is \nalso an incredibly important taxpayer protection law. With relatively \nlittle money necessary to fund the administration of the TRIA program, \nwe have ensured that insurers and policyholders take the first $30 to \n$40 billion of losses of a potential terrorist attack.\n  Additionally, there is one provision in this legislation that I \nbelieve is an important component--the mandate for the President's \nWorking Group--our Nation's Federal financial regulators--to do an \nanalysis of the long-term availability and affordability of terrorism \nrisk insurance.\n  This legislation provides for a 2-year extension of TRIA--and in \nthese next 2 years we need to find a long-term solution to this issue. \nIt may be determined that this is an unwritable risk for the private \nsector and that a continued Federal role is needed or we may find that \ninsurers are able to return to underwriting this risk without a Federal \nbackstop. But we need to start work on developing this information and \npotential solutions as soon as possible.\n  The enactment of this legislation will extend the TRIA program and \nwill ensure that our Nation and its economy are best prepared to deal \nwith a future terrorist attack. I urge my colleagues to support this \nimportant legislation.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate concur \nin the House amendment with a further amendment which is at the desk, \nthe amendment be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and any statements be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

This bill, the Terrorism Risk Extension Act, was enacted 3\n\n[[Page S13934]]\n\nyears ago in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks and was intended \nat the time to provide temporary mechanisms to allow the marketplace to \nadapt after the economic dislocations that resulted from those attacks \non September 11.\n  This summer, Treasury Secretary Snow issued a report highlighting the \nimportance of allowing private insurance companies to regain their hold \nin the marketplace. As the report showed, TRIA successfully bridged \nthat gap created by the September 11 terrorist attacks and very \neffectively enabled the insurance marks to stabilize.\n  The continued presence of the federally backed subsidy risked \ncrowding out private market initiatives and slowing down, impeding the \ndevelopment of private market solutions. That is why I called for an \nextension of TRIA that was narrow, that was targeted and minimized \ninterference with our markets.\n  The bill we just passed achieves that goal. The taxpayers' exposure \nis lessened by reducing the lines of coverage subject to the Federal \nbackstop, and the insurance industry's exposure is increased.\n  I am gratified we passed the bill. Over the long term the Federal \nGovernment cannot be a substitute for market-based solutions.\n  I thank Chairman Shelby and Senator Dodd for their hard work on this \nvery important bill. It hasn't been easy, but it has now been \naccomplished.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/16/senate-section/article/S13934-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13934]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Res. 283\n\n       Whereas on January 13, 1903, the arrival of 102 pioneer \n     immigrants to the United States initiated the first chapter \n     of Korean immigration to the United States;\n       Whereas members of the early Korean American community \n     served with distinction in the Armed Forces of the United \n     States during World War I, World War II, and the conflict in \n     Korea;\n       Whereas in the early 1950s, thousands of Koreans, fleeing \n     from war, poverty, and desolation, came to the United States \n     seeking opportunities;\n       Whereas Korean Americans, like waves of immigrants to the \n     United States before them, have taken root and thrived as a \n     result of strong family ties, robust community support, and \n     countless hours of hard work;\n       Whereas the contributions of Korean Americans to the United \n     States include the invention of the first beating heart \n     operation for coronary artery heart disease, development of \n     the nectarine, a 4-time Olympic gold medalist, and \n     achievements in engineering, architecture, medicine, acting, \n     singing, sculpture, and writing;\n       Whereas Korean Americans play a crucial role in maintaining \n     the strength and vitality of the United States-Korean \n     partnership;\n       Whereas the centennial year of 2003 marked an important \n     milestone in the now more than 100-year history of Korean \n     immigration; and\n       Whereas the Centennial Committees of Korean Immigration and \n     Korean Americans have designated January 13th of each year as \n     ``Korean American Day'' to memorialize the more than 100-year \n     journey of Korean Americans in the United States: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of a ``Korean American \n     Day'';\n       (2) commemorates the 103rd anniversary of the arrival of \n     the first Korean immigrants to the United States; and\n       (3) encourages the people of the United States to--\n       (A) share in such commemoration in order to greater \n     appreciate the valuable contributions Korean Americans have \n     made to the United States; and\n       (B) to observe ``Korean American Day'' with appropriate \n     programs, ceremonies, and activities.\n\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/16/senate-section/article/S13937-6", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13937-S13938]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                              THE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, tomorrow we will return to session. As I \nstated this morning, we are waiting for additional legislative items to \ncome from the House. The House may vote on the Defense authorization \nconference report later this evening or tomorrow morning. I am unaware \nof anyone who has requested a rollcall vote on that conference report \nand, therefore, we expect to debate that during tomorrow's session if \nthat measure is received.\n  We also have a number of nominations we have been working on over the \nlast several days. We expect to get those wrapped up tomorrow. At this \npoint, we anticipate acting on those nominations without the need for \nrollcall votes.\n  Having said that, we will be in session working on the important \nbusiness that remains. At this juncture, after discussion with the \nDemocratic leader, we do not anticipate a need for rollcall votes \ntomorrow. I want to say that in a very careful way because we have so \nmuch happening right now and, as I said, we will be working through \nmuch of the night, and we want to continue to move forward on measures. \nSenators have been patient. We have said for some time that we would be \nin this weekend, Saturday and in all likelihood Sunday as well, working \nthrough our final business.\n  Tomorrow, I will continue to work with the Democratic leader to clear \nas much as we possibly can by unanimous consent. We also expect the \nDefense appropriations conference report to be ready at some point this \nweekend, and we will turn to that measure just as\n\n[[Page S13944]]\n\nsoon as we possibly can, as soon as it is ready.\n  We will remain in session to receive items from the House, and we \nwill remain available to begin any necessary procedural options that \nare warranted. We will need to act on a continuing resolution tomorrow, \nand we will pass that when received from the House.\n  As I mentioned, Members continue to ask about the schedule. We are \ndoing our very best to keep our colleagues apprised as we go forward. \nThere is a lot of work going on with negotiations off the floor. We \nwill monitor those discussions and alert all Members as we get closer \nto having these last bills ready.\n  Again, at this point, I do not see a need for rollcall votes \ntomorrow, although we will have to wait to see what we receive from the \nHouse.\n  With regard to a Sunday session and Monday session, just as soon as \nwe make final decisions in terms of timing, we will let people know as \nquickly as possible. If we do not vote on Sunday--and we are not \nprepared to say that yet--we would notify people as soon as that \ndecision could be made. We are going to have a very busy Monday and \nvotes will in all likelihood begin early Monday morning. This will not \nbe a typical Monday where we do not vote until late in the afternoon. \nAgain, I will have more to say regarding Sunday's schedule tomorrow.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. I understand the difficulties of the distinguished \nRepublican leader, especially these last few days of this session of \nthe Congress, but I would say that one way to expedite this is to get \nthe Defense appropriations bill over here as quickly as possible and \nmove in the ordinary course. I have said on the record and off the \nrecord, trying to stick this ANWR provision in a place it does not \nbelong is going to create for this body untoward problems in the \nfuture.\n  I am a long timer of the Appropriations Committee and the rule that \nis now in effect dealing with the scope of the conference; that is, the \nmatters in the conference report that come back to the Senate floor \nhave to be pertinent to the subject matter of the legislation that is \ntaken to conference.\n  We could complete the Defense appropriations bill in a matter of \nminutes but for this. There are people of goodwill on both sides of the \naisle who do not like that process of trying to stick on this bill the \nunimaginable. I was not happy when earlier this year we lost on ANWR. \nThe bill went out of here and the place where it could legally be put \nin a bill, that is reconciliation spending, was stripped by the House \nof Representatives. As a result of that, now we come back with this \nsuggestion that they are going to stick it on the Defense \nappropriations bill.\n  This is a body that lives by rules. We cannot be changing them just \nbecause the other side has more votes. So I would simply say to the \ndistinguished majority leader, I hope he would help us stop this \nmischievous thing. I hope we have more of my friends on the other side \nof the aisle join with us in this, which is the right thing to do.\n  I have heard the senior Senator from Arizona give speeches on this \nmatter numerous times: Why did you put that in conference? Those are \nthings within the scope. I cannot imagine how the Senator from Arizona \nmust feel about putting something in a bill that has nothing relating \nto the scope.\n  I say to all Senators that one way to wind up this session in a very \npositive vein is passing the Defense appropriations bill, not having to \ngo through steps that would take us to have to invoke cloture on the \nDefense appropriations bill, change the rules of the Senate, change \nprecedence in the Senate.\n  I am terribly disappointed this is even being contemplated. I am \nwilling to work with the distinguished leader and try to work things \nout this weekend. I do not contemplate any votes that would be \nnecessary. We have to do the continuing resolution and we will complete \nthat as soon as we get it. On my side I am not aware of any amendments \non that. I spoke earlier this evening to the distinguished ranking \nmember of the Armed Services Committee and he said he and the chairman, \nSenator Warner, are at a point where they can complete that legislation \nvery quickly, and I hope that is the case. If we could finish Defense \nauthorization, Defense appropriations, we could be out of here on \nSunday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise to address the Senate on the status \nof the progress the conferees are making with regard to the Defense \nauthorization bill. We have been in constant negotiations throughout \nthe week and I am pleased to say that Chairman Hunter, who has \nexhibited extraordinary leadership, together with myself, Senator \nLevin, and Congressman Ike Skelton, we concluded our final conference \nwith Members today. It was my understanding the bill would be filed in \nthe House tonight.\n  Accordingly, I provided a signature sheet, which is the standard \nprotocol. All 13 members of the Armed Services Committee on the \nRepublican side signed the sheet and Senator Levin likewise authorized \nme to include his sheet of those Democrats which signed. So they are \nnow in the possession of the House of Representatives again in \nanticipation that the bill will be filed.\n  Congressman Hunter is a man I have dealt with for many years and have \nthe greatest respect for, and because of our close working and trusting \nrelationship, he called me tonight, about half an hour ago, to advise \nme there was some interest among some Members of the House to have that \nconference report on the House side reopened and another measure \ninserted. He described the measure, but as a matter of courtesy and \nprivacy I will not describe it.\n  I indicated to Congressman Hunter and other members of the House \nleadership that I would be in opposition; that I felt duty bound as \nchairman to withdraw the signatures of the 13 Republicans. I called \nSenator Levin and acquainted him with the status of this matter and he \nasked that I ask Congressman Hunter to return his sheet with all \nsignatures if the House, in its wisdom, opens that bill and inserts \nanother provision in it. So that is the status.\n  In the very unfortunate event that we have our signature sheets \nreturned to us and this particular provision is placed in the House \nbill, I would have to go to my Members on the Republican side and \nindicate to them that I could not support this measure if it were to be \nplaced in this bill. I might support it in the context of other \nlegislative means, but I would not on this. Therefore, there is a \nquestion of whether with my signature being withdrawn--Senator Levin \nsaid he expressed doubt that his members would join, so there would \nprobably be insufficient signatures for the filing of this bill.\n  I do not take the floor by means of threatening those with good \nintentions to try every avenue to foster their interest in legislation, \nbut our Nation is at war, and this bill has been, for various reasons, \non a very long journey in getting to this moment in time. Many Members \nof this body, most especially the members of the Armed Services \nCommittee, both sides of the aisle, have worked diligently on this \nbill. Our collective staffs have gone around the clock for days in this \nabbreviated session to try and produce the conference report, and I \ncommend them for the work, and that report has been produced. It is our \nunderstanding that it was finalized about 2:30 today and the House was \nin the process of filing the bill tonight.\n  So I indicate that this Senator will not in any way allow this bill \nto come to the floor--I will exercise every right I have--with this \nprovision in it. At this point in time, if, for example, for some \nreason--my colleagues and I do not in any way threaten my fellow \ncolleagues who I presume might have an interest in this position--were \nto send over the report without my signature and such signatures that \nthey may get on the other side and that comes over, then I am prepared \nto exercise my rights under rule XVIII and every available means not to \nallow this bill to contain this provision, because I think we are \nabsolutely dutybound to the men and women of the Armed Forces and to \ntheir families and to the Commander in Chief, with whom I was \nprivileged to meet yesterday, the President of the United States, on a \nmatter that was of great importance to him and other members of our \ncommittee, most particularly one member, Senator McCain, who was with \nme. It was understood that we were finally resolving what we considered \nthe last major issue.\n\n[[Page S13945]]\n\n  I commend the President on the manner in which he and his staff \nworked with me and Congressman Hunter and others to resolve this \nquestion. So we had finally concluded and listened diligently today to \nthe members of the committee who had some views and closed it out at \n2:30.\n  Now this has arisen. Again, people over on the other side, the other \nbody, have a perfect right to exercise their rights, but I have to \nindicate, and I think in fairness to the leadership of the Senate and \nthe leadership of the House, my steadfast opposition to this procedure. \nThere has to come a time around here when conference reports are \nclosed, as it was indicated to us, signature sheets provided, and we \nshould go forward.\n  This bill is vitally necessary to this Nation at this hour. When \nevery day we are losing men, killed and wounded, and the horrific \ndamages to them and their families, we must be steadfast in our \nresolve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish I had the words to express the \nthoughts I have in my heart now. I love history. I love the Senate. I \nhave spent a lot of my life here. The mere fact that I am a Senator is, \nevery day, hard for me to comprehend. But I am, and I am so thankful to \nthe people in Nevada for allowing me to serve.\n  But I want to say to the senior Senator from the State of Virginia \nthat when the history books are written about this institution and \nsomeone flips through like a dictionary, wanting to have described what \na U.S. Senator should be, John Warner has to be near the top of that \nlist, if not at the top. He is a man who is a gentleman. I have served \nwith him now for 23 years. He is a man who believes in this institution \nand has the record to prove it. He is a person who is a good member of \nhis political party, but he is also a patriot. As important as the two-\nparty system is to our country, to the Senator from Virginia, party \ncomes second, country comes first.\n  As I said, I don't have the ability to express my conviction about \nthis man. But the statement he just made, his off-the-cuff statement, \nis what the Senate is all about. It is about protecting this country, \nthe individual rights of Members of the Senate, and that is why John \nWarner is a great Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, with a deep sense of humility, I thank my \ncolleague. I am undeserving of those remarks. Each day I am here, each \nday I grow a little older, I grow more humble and thankful to the good \nLord for allowing me to greet each day and do what I feel is best in \nthe interests of this country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/16/senate-section/article/S13945-2", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13945]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 4 P.M.
