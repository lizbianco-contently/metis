We expect amendments to be \noffered later in the day on Monday. There will be no rollcall votes on \nMonday. I anticipate debating amendments and setting votes to occur on \nTuesday morning. Therefore, we expect at least one vote to occur \nTuesday prior to the policy meetings.\n  As a reminder to our colleagues, we will have the official photograph \ntaken in the Senate Chamber at 2:15 on Tuesday. Senators should be \nseated at their desk promptly at 2:15 to avoid missing that photograph.\n  Following that, we have a debate period set aside prior to a cloture \nvote on a mine safety and health nomination reported out of the HELP \ncommittee back in March.\n  Early next week, we will be considering the supplemental \nappropriations conference report when it arrives from the House. We \nhope to dispose of that conference report in a reasonable amount of \ntime in order to return to the Defense authorization bill.\n  Clearly, there is much to do next week. We will need everyone's \nassistance as we schedule these items.\n  We currently have a lot of things going on in addition to what is \ngoing on in the Senate Chamber. The supplemental conference bill, as \nmost people have heard, is coming along and has come along very well. \nWe will be doing that next week. There is a pensions bill in \nconference. There is real progress being made on that particular bill \nas well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/09/senate-section/article/S5677-9", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5677-S5678]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      ALLIGATOR ALLEY CAR ACCIDENT\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I take a few moments to share an account of \nan event that occurred nearly 3\\1/2\\ years ago. The story I tell is a \nvery tragic story. At the time, it received a lot of media coverage, \nbut because of a recent fortuitous occurrence, it has again become \nrelevant.\n  Each year around Christmas, some time before, usually afterwards, my \nfamily, Karyn and our three boys, and my extended family, have a \ntradition of going to Fort Lauderdale, FL, a tradition that began well \nover 40 years ago by my parents and my own brothers and sisters--I have \ntwo brothers and two sisters--and their children, and usually, almost \nalways, several friends from a number of those individuals spend time \ntogether enjoying the\n\n[[Page S5678]]\n\noccasion, being together as a family, reliving old memories and, along \nthe way, creating new ones.\n  On New Year's Day in 2003, I had taken my sons, Jonathan and Bryan, \ntwo of my three sons, on a trip to the Everglades. It was to spend the \nday in the Everglades, showing them the beauty of that wonderful area \nand the rich tradition that is reflected by the beauty there and by \nnature. We had a wonderful day.\n  On the way back--and this is west of Fort Lauderdale--on the way back \nin, we were heading down what is Interstate 75 west in that part of \nFlorida. It runs directly east back to Fort Lauderdale. That whole \ntrack is known as Alligator Alley. It was an ordinary day. We had a \nwonderful day together as a family. It was a great start to a new \nyear--again, it was New Year's Day--an opportunity to share with family \nthe beauty of that environment, the gorgeous, wonderful, magnificent \npart of this country.\n  As we were talking about events of the day as we were driving, \nsuddenly traffic came to a halt. Just ahead, I saw red lights flashing. \nWe pulled onto the median. I came out of the car because something \nclearly had happened, and it had just happened several moments earlier.\n  Walking down the median, I approached a horrific scene. It was a \nlittle bit in the distance, 100 yards away. There was a crumpled red \ncar on its side, an SUV. There were men, women, and children who \nclearly had been thrown, hurled from that vehicle, a distance of 25, \n50, even 75 yards. I remember looking out--again, it was a beautiful \nday, a sunny day--and as with any event such as this that occurs so \nquickly, so unexpectedly, we saw the streaming smoke coming from an \noverturned vehicle with an open door. We saw a crushed car. We did not \nsee another car near it. Clearly, the car had flipped. Then we saw \nthese bodies that were hurled, thrown, from this vehicle a great \ndistance in this beautiful green median. It was a surreal environment.\n  It was not immediately clear to me how many people had been injured, \nbut the fact you could tell there were several people around the car, \nand there were at least four people in the median over this distance, I \nknew that what I was witnessing was clearly devastating. It was \nserious.\n  At that time, there were no other health personnel on the scene. As a \ndoctor, and as one who has spent days and years in emergency rooms and \nin operating rooms, in terms of the immediate response, it comes pretty \nnatural in terms of evaluation, triage, and resuscitation. The real \nchallenge was being out there, and you saw over a distance of 75 yards \nfour people who had such a traumatic accident. Two adults had climbed \nout of the vehicle itself. There were four individuals--four, what \nappeared to be lifeless, motionless bodies, women and children, two \nchildren and two adults--who lay in the median.\n  Lara Spalding, whom I did not know at the time--I will come back to \nLara in just a little bit--then was a nursing student at Nashville--\nthis is the irony of it--Nashville's Belmont University, and actually \nworked in the emergency room there with some of my colleagues back at \nVanderbilt, where I worked for 10 years as a cardio surgeon, heart \nsurgeon, trauma surgeon.\n  She later described the scene that day:\n\n       It was awful. It looked like someone had dropped six people \n     from a 5-story building.\n\n  At that point in time when I was there--and I didn't know Lara at the \ntime--she was there either at the same time or a few seconds \nafterwards, there were no other doctors on the scene. Alligator Alley \nbeing so far out at that time--although it has changed, thank \ngoodness--the emergency personnel had to come from within Fort \nLauderdale to come out along one stretch of highway. It was probably \n25, 30 miles, so health personnel were not yet on the scene.\n  When that sort of thing happens, you know your immediate \nresponsibility needs to be to assess the situation, triage their care, \nand to initiate resuscitation appropriately, but the problem is people \nwere scattered over a 75-yard distance.\n  I did what I could; that was, rapidly assess the ABCs in terms of \nresuscitation, in getting airways, and when the medical personnel \nstarted to arrive, both by helicopter, trauma teams, relief teams and \nambulances started coming in, help them triage and direct them to the \npeople who needed the care the most. And then for individuals \nconducting the appropriate resuscitation, of establishing an airway, \nmaking sure they were breathing and receiving CPR.\n  In that sort of event, it is important to get someone on the \ntelephone to coordinate overall, so I spent a lot of time talking to \n911 and the hospitals that coordinated the personnel, and as the \nparamedics arrived by helicopter, was able to say: You are on the \nground now. Don't waste your time here; that is taken care of. And they \nwere able to go to another patient.\n  I mentioned all that because I do think it is important for people to \nparticipate. Lara, at the time, was with one of the patients, cradling \nthem, giving appropriate encouragement and instruction to personnel who \nwere arriving who very much appreciate her heroism in stopping along \nthe side of the road and assisting.\n  In addition to Ms. Spalding, there was an off-duty paramedic and five \nothers who also stopped to help. Ms. Spalding, Lara Spalding--I will \ncome back to her again shortly--at that time was a nursing student but \nbefore had been an Army medic who had worked at Vanderbilt University \nTrauma Center. She was of huge assistance in terms of the triage, \nassisting the paramedics.\n  I remember her going over to one boy who had a mangled leg. She \ncradled his head and tried to keep him comfortable. She later said:\n\n       You're prepared for this when you're in a trauma center . . \n     . but not when you're driving down the road.\n\n  I also want to comment on the men and women of the Broward County \nSheriff's Office Division of Fire Rescue, particularly Incident \nCommander Chris Koski and his firefighters who also came on the scene \nand were so professional, so experienced. They deserve tremendous \ncredit.\n  As far as the rescue operators, the first responders out there do not \nget enough credit. They are out there 24 hours a day responding to \nthese incidents. They responded in such a quiet, humble, and heroic \nway. They all deserve our gratitude. They are heroes, not just for this \nparticular day but for the work they do every day. That is what they do \nevery single day and night.\n  I do remember the people whom we could not help: Felicienne Kali, a \nbeautiful 11-year-old girl whom we were unable to resuscitate, died at \nthe scene. Her 14-year-old brother, Felix Kali, unfortunately, died \nlater that day. Shadia Rene, a 20-year-old half-sister of the two, we \nwere able to resuscitate but died 3 days later at the hospital. The two \nparents lived. A family friend who was in the automobile also lived.\n  After the tragic events of that day, I went back to see them the next \nday at the hospital, to console and to comfort them as much as one can \nin that time of tragedy.\n  There is little anyone can say directly to a family or to people \ninvolved to address such grief, but I do pray for their family to this \nday.\n  I clearly wish there was more that could have been done in response, \ndespite the heroic actions of so many of the paramedical personnel, \nfirst responders, and Lara Spalding. I keep mentioning Lara Spalding \nbecause it was 2 years ago that my staff ran into her and talked to \nher. She was at that time working as a nurse at the Johns Hopkins \nUniversity Hospital. In May, she took a new job. Today, she works here \nin the Nation's Capitol. I didn't know this until just a few days ago. \nShe works in the Office of the Attending Physician. I was unaware of \nthat and then had the opportunity to learn about that last week. I am \ndelighted that she is here in the Nation's Capitol. I know she will be \nof great service to the U.S. Congress and to our Nation. While I would \nhave gladly recommended her based specifically on her actions that day, \nI clearly had no role in her actually being hired but do appreciate her \nservice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/09/senate-section/article/S5678-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5678-S5679]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUPPLEMENTAL SPENDING\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the issue of spending in \nWashington, DC. None of us, as elected representatives, Democrat or \nRepublican, in the House or the Senate, can go home without people \nsaying: Washington seems to be spending too much.\n\n[[Page S5679]]\n\nI mention that only because we are going to be addressing the \nsupplemental bill.\n  As many people saw on the news last night, agreement was reached on \nthe limit and content of the supplemental spending bill which we have \nbeen working on for well over 2 months. What we will talk about next \nweek but what was demonstrated and what was released by the conference \nlast night is that we are on the right track today. The level and the \nsubstance of that bill does adhere to our calls for a conference report \nthat limited its total amount to the President's request for true \nemergency spending--no fat, no excessive spending. Those criteria have \nbeen met. It focuses resources on important priorities, priorities such \nas funding border security, which we spent well over a month on this \nfloor talking about, on conducting the war on terror, and aiding \nhurricane recovery--all while exercising tight fiscal restraint and \nresponsibility.\n  Also of note, the bill contains a fiscally prudent spending level for \nthis year's regular appropriations bills. This bill sets a \ndiscretionary spending level at the President's request of $873 \nbillion--another very important point of maintaining fiscal discipline.\n  I applaud the leadership of Senator Cochran and Congressman Lewis in \nthe House to control Federal spending and to ensure effective and \nappropriate Government use of taxpayer dollars so that our deficit can \ncontinue to decline and our economy can continue to grow and prosper.\n  This adherence to keeping spending low, coupled with our Republican \ntax policy, has ushered in record economic growth: 5.3 million jobs \nhave been created over the last 3 years; unemployment is down to 4.6, \n4.7 percent, lower than the average of the 1990s, lower than the \naverage of the 1970s--again, a huge success.\n  There is a lot more we have to do, but this supplemental bill is an \nimportant step, following through on Republican principles of fiscal \nrestraint.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The Senator from Montana is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/09/senate-section/article/S5679-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5679-S5680]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              IMMIGRATION\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise to comment on the events of the past \nweek. We have received word that the leading terrorist in Iraq, Abu \nMusab al-Zarqawi, who was the mastermind of countless brutal attacks \nand taking lives of members of the U.S. Armed Forces and thousands of \ninnocent Iraqis, was killed. This has been a long time coming. I \ncommend those who worked tirelessly over the past year to finally see \nthe fruits of their labors. Their dedication has saved countless lives. \nBut that does not mean the war on terror is over. We still have a lot \nof work to do. We know the terrorists never give up. The greatest \nweapon they have is, of course, fear.\n  Last weekend, we also heard of a terrorist plot uncovered in Canada. \nFortunately, those behind that plot were arrested before they could \ncarry out their plans to murder the Canadian Prime Minister.\n  We are getting better at our intelligence. We are stopping these \nattacks. Of course, this will continue to be our mission, and for the \npeople who are in the business of short-circuiting these plots, their \njob may never end. Terrorists will stop at nothing to incite fear in \nthe minds and hearts of Americans and free-loving people all over the \nworld.\n  We will fight as long as it takes to defeat them. Part of that fight \nis ensuring our security at home. My State of Montana borders Canada. \nIn our part of the country, I like to say there is a lot of dirt \nbetween light bulbs. That makes it difficult to effectively patrol the \nborder between my State and our friends to the north. Next time, will \nterrorists enter somewhere along that 550-mile border that my State \nshares with Canada? What makes it even more difficult is we are used to \ngoing back and forth between my State and Canada. We have farmers who \nfarm on both sides of the border. They own farms in Canada, and they \nalso own farms in Montana. Of course, we like the freedom of that \nmovement.\n  The arrests last weekend have proven that illegal activity happens on \nour northern border, just like the problems we have on our southern \nborder. I have said many times during the discussion of the immigration \nbill that we must know who is coming in this country and what for, and \nwe also cannot have any credibility with the American people until we \nsecure the border.\n\n  The Senate recently passed a massive immigration bill. There were a \nnumber of border security measures in the legislation--recommendations \nfor a security fence, using the National Guard as backup and technical \nsupport, and other features. There were also provisions to enhance the \nsecurity of our northern border, although I think even those could be \nstronger.\n  Most notably, however, this legislation did something else with which \nthe American people do not agree: this legislation gave a pathway to \ncitizenship for millions of illegal aliens. For this reason, I simply \ncould not support the bill. Not only is it bad policy, but it sends the \nmessage that entering this country illegally is somehow OK.\n  Folks in my State have said: No amnesty for illegal aliens. They have \nbeen saying that until they are blue in the face. They feel strongly \nabout it, so strongly that I received bricks in the mail with big \nletters on them: Secure the border and build the wall. I am not a big \nfan of walls. They have never had a history of success. But \nnonetheless, it sends a strong message on the things we should be \ndoing.\n  It is a plain fact that illegal activity happens every day on our \nborders. We are in a great project in the State of Montana called the \nMontana Meth Project. We are finding out that meth houses have been \nshut down. Law enforcement has done their job in our State. What we are \nfinding now is meth coming in from outside our borders. Crystal meth is \none of the worst fights we have in our State. Other criminal activities \npose a threat to the safety of local communities and to our national \nsecurity as a whole. I know folks in my State have seen this happen \nfirsthand.\n  Up on the hi-line, border agents in Havre, MT, have arrested illegal \nimmigrants from as many as 35 different countries. Many of these \nillegal immigrants are found hiding on trains as they pass through \nHavre and several other towns on the hi-line of Montana. In February, a \nfugitive thought to be armed and dangerous led the Montana Highway \nPatrol on two high-speed chases near Kalispell, MT, before being \napprehended. He was trying to escape to Canada. Last October, Border \nPatrol agents spotted a man driving in a stolen pickup toward the \nCanadian border outside of Cut Bank, MT. After a standoff, the man was \nshot by officers acting in self-defense.\n  I know my colleagues from States that share international borders, \nnorthern and southern, have stories like this. They can go on forever. \nWe have illegal aliens still flooding into this country through our \nsouthern border every day and, yes, some through the northern border. \nIt is not too much to ask for our law enforcement agencies to find, \ndetain, and deport those who have broken the law. It is overwhelming.\n  It is amazing to me that we can so diligently pursue terrorists as \ndangerous and as murderous as al-Zarqawi in Iraq and be successful, yet \nwe do not meet with the same success here in this country. When it \ncomes to our own borders, our own immigration policies, mistakes \ncontinue to be made both on the ground and here in this Congress.\n  More importantly, when we allow illegal aliens to stay, what kind of \na message does that send to the rest of the world about our immigration \npolicy? If you come here illegally, just wait it out. That is the \nmessage we are sending now. We will give you amnesty eventually. It \nseems that 20 years from now, it will be amnesty once again for even \nmore of those who would enter this country illegally. The 1986 \nimmigration reform act didn't work. Basically, the bill that recently \npassed the Senate--not with my support--almost mirrors the 1986 act. \nWhat good is history if we don't learn the lesson?\n  As the House and Senate come together to conference on this \nlegislation, I advise taking into account what the American people are \ntelling us. They are telling us what they want, and they are very clear \nwith the message. Just as we continue our efforts in Iraq and our fight \nin this war on terrorism abroad, we must also ensure a secure border \nand sound immigration policy at home. There is no way we can\n\n[[Page S5680]]\n\nskirt the issue. It burns in the hearts of everybody in my State. They \nare very clear about the message. You do first things first and second \nthings second.\n  The first thing we have to do to gain any credibility with the \nAmerican people is to secure the border, knowing what the cost will be \nand knowing the job that is ahead of us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The first is the announcement that the United States and \nforeign counterterrorism officials have worked together to make a \nseries of arrests that appear to be linked to a web of Islamic \nextremists in Canada, the United States, and Europe. The recent death \nof Iraqi insurgent leader and al-Qaida member Abu Mus'ab al-Zarqawi is \nanother. These are significant victories against those who wish our \ncountry harm.\n  Last week, Canadian officials arrested 17 people for allegedly \nplotting to carry out a campaign of bombings, kidnappings and other \nterrorist acts in Ottawa and Toronto. The arrests were made possible by \nthe monitoring of Internet chat rooms and e-mail accounts tied to \nsuspected Islamic extremists. The arrests came after three tons of \nammonium nitrate--common garden fertilizer that is easily transformed \ninto an explosive--was allegedly purchased from undercover officers. \nTwo of 17 suspected terrorists were caught trying to smuggle guns and \nammunition from the United States into Canada via the Peace Bridge last \nsummer.\n  These individuals were allegedly using the Internet to communicate \nwith terrorist facilitators abroad, such as a 22-year-old Web site \noperator with direct links to al-Qaida who was arrested by British \npolice last October on charges of financing and supporting terrorist \nactivities. Authorities believe the Web site operator was in contact \nwith the individuals in the Canadian arrests, as well as two men in the \nU.S., sharing surveillance videos and other information for potential \nterrorist attacks. Included in the surveillance videos were many \nWashington, DC, landmarks.\n  Also, just last Tuesday British police arrested an American student \nin London as he prepared to board a flight to Pakistan. He was wanted \nin New York for allegedly providing military equipment to people who \ntook it to members of Osama bin Laden's terrorist organization in \nPakistan. Authorities have not ruled out a connection to the Canadian \narrests.\n  Here in the U.S., the New York and Atlanta joint terrorism task \nforces recently arrested two men in connection with an alleged \nterrorist plot. The plot included discussions about blowing up oil \nrefineries and disabling navigational aids on airplanes. The \ninvestigation began when California police arrested two men for a gas \nstation robbery. A subsequent search of their home turned up documents \nlisting the addresses of U.S. military recruiting stations, the Israeli \nConsulate, and synagogues in the Los Angeles area. The investigation \neventually revealed the existence of a terrorist cell that had been \nspawned by a small radical group operating in Folsom Prison who \nconsidered themselves the ``al-Qaida of California.''\n  American counterterrorism officials are joining forces with their \ncolleagues around the world to unravel intricate webs of terrorist \norganizations that would do us great harm if not for the efforts of \nthese countterror experts. I commend them for their efforts to discover \nterrorist plots and bring them to a stop before they are carried out.\n  Much further from home, but still close to our hearts are the brave \nmen and women of our Armed Forces deployed in the Middle East and \nAfghanistan.\n  I thank our servicemen and servicewomen in the U.S. Armed Forces for \ntheir on-going service to their country, their commitment to American \nideals, and their determination to win the global war on terror. We \nneed to continually express our gratitude to the families of the U.S. \nmilitary personnel, especially those families who have lost loved ones \nduring our most recent deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  Most important, our Armed Forces continue to seek out terrorists to \ndisrupt their plans both in the Middle East and abroad. They also \ncontinue to provide support and guidance to the Iraqi and Afghani \npeople in their newborn democracies. With their steadfast courage, our \ncitizens in uniform have taken the battle to the enemy and achieved \nsuccess.\n  Their most recent victory was the elimination of insurgent leader and \nal-Qaida member Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. His death is an enormous blow to \nthose who continue to terrorize the Iraqi people. Zarqawi, whom Osama \nBin Laden has heaped praise upon, has lead a horrific campaign against \nour troops in Iraq and against the Iraqi people. I am thankful to say \nthat this mass murderer will no longer be able to carry on attempts at \nundermining the Iraqi national government and the coalition.\n  Of note in his demise is the international cooperation that \nspearheaded the operation. After receiving tips and intelligence of his \nlocation from Jordanian sources, Coalition forces killed Zarqawi and \nmany of his lieutenants yesterday in an airstrike. It was this exchange \nof intelligence information between the United States and Jordan that \nhelped to permanently end Zarqawi's operations. I should also note that \nthe Iraqi police were first on the scene after the air strike to help \nidentify our success.\n  Also, perhaps lost among this news yesterday was another announcement \nmade by Prime Minister Al-Maliki of Iraq that candidates have been \nnamed for important cabinet posts in the Iraqi government. After much \nnegotiation, consensus picks were made to fill the defense and interior \nministries--both key to a more secure and stable Iraq. Much of our \nsuccess depends on the men and women forming the Iraqi government, and \nthese are important steps to meeting the security challenges.\n  The recent announcements in Iraq and our international \ncounterterrorism efforts, while significant, are only small victories \nin the overall global war on terror. There are more extremists who will \nline up to preach against democracy and freedom. There are still those \nthat will attack the free people of this world and want to do us much \nharm.\n  After news of Zarqawi's death, the forces of al-Qaida in Iraq vowed \npublicly to continue their so-called ``holy war'' on innocent \ncivilians. They have stated:\n\n       The death of our leaders is life for us. It will only \n     increase our persistence in continuing holy war so that the \n     word of God will be supreme.\n\n  In fact, only two hours after the Zarqawi announcement a bomb blew up \nin Baghdad killing at least nineteen people. It is clear that our \nsuccess in Iraq against this enemy depends greatly on our continual \ncooperation with the Iraqi government and the new ministers in charge \nof security there.\n  The global war on terror has been a great challenge for our Nation. \nYet while the cost has been high, the cost of doing nothing would be \neven greater. And we cannot do this alone. Only with help of our \nneighbors, countrymen, and allies throughout the world can we assure \nthat our democratic ideals defeat those of the terrorist extremists. I \nthank all of them for a job well done.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n20 minutes in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/09/senate-section/article/S5680-2", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5680-S5681]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           FIGHTING TERRORISM\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, there are two things on my mind today that \nI wanted to share with our colleagues.\n  First of all, I wanted to come to the floor to take issue with \nsomething that I view as a disturbing trend that I have seen develop \nover the last few days\n\n[[Page S5681]]\n\nwhen it comes to our ongoing efforts to liberate the Iraqi people and \nto fight the global war on terror.\n  Yesterday, during a 9 a.m. press conference with MG Bill Caldwell, \nthe military spokesman in Baghdad, regarding the mission that killed \nterrorist Abu Mus'ab al-Zarqawi, one reporter asked:\n\n       Were you going for Zarqawi? We've heard that you have been \n     going for some other people and then there was some luck \n     involved.\n\n  To which Major General Caldwell replied:\n\n       We knew exactly who was there. We knew it was Zarqawi. And \n     that was the deliberate target that we went to get.\n\n  An AP story yesterday said:\n\n       What may have changed the Americans' luck was U.S. \n     Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad's efforts to mend relations with \n     Iraq's minority Sunni Arabs, alienated by the U.S. invasion \n     and the new Shiite-dominated government.\n\n  And a story yesterday in Time Magazine entitled ``How They Got \nZarqawi; the Manhunt That Snared Him.''\n  In part I quote that story:\n\n       The fact that intelligence agencies were able to close in \n     on a man who had eluded capture for three years, during which \n     his terror operations left thousands of Iraqis dead, suggests \n     that some of those close enough to know Zarqawi's whereabouts \n     and connections may have been ready to shop him to his \n     enemies. Not necessarily, of course.\n\n  The story goes on to say:\n\n       The intel services could have simply gotten a lucky break \n     through the slow but steady gathering of information, or \n     Zarqawi could have made a mistake. Either way, a key agent in \n     the chaos gripping Iraq has now been taken out of the \n     equation.\n\n  Also, as we know, recently there were arrests of 12 men and 5 youths \nin Canada last weekend, foiling a major terrorist plot to attack \ntargets in southern Ontario. The assistant director of operations of \nthe Canadian Security Intelligence Service said the men arrested are \nfollowers of a ``violent ideology inspired by al-Qaida.''\n  In reporting on this story, CBS News also had this to say with regard \nto recent terror arrests:\n\n       Police in Toledo, Ohio busted another cell in February. \n     This one consisted of three men training to attack U.S. \n     forces overseas. Once again, luck played a role.\n\n  So, Mr. President, I got to thinking about this word, this four-\nletter word ``luck.'' It is certainly a loaded term, and in the context \nof yesterday's operation, I think it is a pretty dismissive term as \nwell.\n  Instead of luck, I would suggest that the elimination of Abu Mus'ab \nal-Zarqawi was a combination of professionalism, patience, persistence, \nand precision munitions, not luck. Professionalism, patience, \npersistence, and precision munitions, not luck.\n  To me, attributing all of this somehow to luck devalues the \npreparation of our men and women in uniform as well as our intelligence \nservices and our coalition forces. It doesn't give adequate credit to \nthe heightened awareness that we have exercised since September 11, \n2001, and it certainly doesn't do justice to patient, relentless \nexecution of the war on terror by our fighting forces and allies. So I \nthink it is time we get a little perspective.\n  Was it luck when officials were conducting an investigation that \nfoiled a plot the impact of which had the potential to rival the \nbombing of the Oklahoma City Federal Building? Was it luck that \nmotivated the Iraqis to tip U.S. forces to Zarqawi's whereabouts? Was \nit luck that trained our forces to execute that critical mission? And \nwhile we are on the subject, was it luck that our men and women in \nuniform executed the invasion and liberation of Iraq successfully and \nin a miraculously short period of time? Was it luck that Saddam Hussein \nwas removed from his position as head of a terrible, tortuous regime \nand found cowering in a spider hole and brought to justice? Was it luck \nwhen CIA forces joined with Pakistani authorities to capture top al-\nQaida operative Khalid Shaikh Mohammed?\n  I can't help but find it interesting that, as the old adage goes, the \nharder our military and intelligence forces work, the luckier they seem \nto get. Or it could be more apt to say it this way, in the words of the \nold adage, luck is when preparation meets opportunity.\n  All of these achievements were hard won, and all of the victories in \nthis global war are bought with a dear price--and we should never \nforget that or try to dismiss that hard work and those efforts, the \ndetermination and sacrifice as merely luck.\n  It is not luck that is bringing the fight to the terrorists' \ndoorstep. It is not luck that our country and our allies are hunting \ndown those who would threaten our freedom and perhaps even our very way \nof life. September 11, 2001, was a dark day in our Nation's history. \nBut let's not forget the meaning of our actions as we fight and win the \nwar on terror is inextricably linked to the events on that day, the day \nthe world mourned with us, the day our friends said, ``Today we are all \nAmericans.''\n  Since that day we have worked to bring terrorists to justice, and we \nare succeeding. We are succeeding because of commitment, dedication, \nhard work, patience, and sacrifice. We are going to continue doing all \nthat we can and all that we must to defend the cause of freedom.\n  I caution those who would dismiss these efforts in a world that in \nthis context has little meaning. Let's recognize these accomplishments \nfor what they are and be thankful for the protection provided by our \nmen and women in uniform, our intelligence communities, our friends, \nand our allies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/09/senate-section/article/S5681-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5681-S5682]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              IMMIGRATION\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I note that today the Department of \nHomeland Security is announcing the publication of a regulation that \naddresses a deficiency in the work verification process to make sure \nthat only people who can legally work in the United States are capable \nof doing so. Of course, this is long overdue.\n  The Senate and the House have both passed immigration bills that \nwould overhaul employment verification laws. Restricting the employment \nof undocumented workers as a means of reducing illegal immigration is \nnot a new concept. For decades, policymakers have recognized that \neliminating the magnet of illegal employment is the key, some might \neven say the linchpin, to controlling illegal immigration.\n  In 1981, the bipartisan Select Commission on Immigration and Refugee \nPolicy recommended legislation making it illegal to hire undocumented \nworkers. In 1997, the bipartisan U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform \nstated that eliminating the employment magnet is the linchpin of a \ncomprehensive strategy to deter unlawful immigration.\n  The U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform went on to conclude that \n``the most promising option for verifying work authorization is a \ncomputerized registry based on the Social Security number.''\n  Despite 25 years of consensus, current employment verification laws \nare unworkable and unenforceable. An employer must review some \ncombination of up to 29 different documents to determine whether a new \nworker is legal. Document fraud and identity theft have contributed to \nthe problem, making it easier for unscrupulous employers to look the \nother way and hire unauthorized workers. The employer sanctions \nprovisions that were passed in 1986, which were supposed to be the \ntradeoff for the amnesty provided to 3 million people--those employer \nsanctions have been completely ineffective. So while the amnesty was a \nsuccess in the sense that 3 million people got a pass, the enforcement \nnecessary to avoid another buildup of illegal aliens was never \ndelivered.\n  As I said at the outset, the Department of Homeland Security is \nissuing the publication of a regulation today that addresses this \ndeficiency. It is proposing a rule that will help responsible employers \nensure that they are not employing individuals who cannot legally work \nin the United States. When hired, employees in the United States must \npresent documents to their employers to show that they can work here \nlegally. Many people use their Social Security card as one of those \ndocuments.\n  When unauthorized aliens try to defraud their employers by presenting \nfraudulent identification or Social Security cards, the employers will \noften receive a ``no match'' letter from the Social Security \nadministration. This ``no match'' letter informs the employer that the \nname associated with the Social Security number does not match.\n\n[[Page S5682]]\n\n  Until now, many employers have not known what steps to take upon \nreceiving such a mismatch notice. Many mistakenly believe that they \nmust immediately fire the employee. The absence of clear guidance has \nfrustrated employers and, all too often, legal employees end up losing \ntheir jobs because of this confusion. The proposed rule outlines clear \nsteps that employers can take in reaction to receiving ``no match'' \nletters.\n  The proposed rule contains a safe harbor for employers. If businesses \nfollow these procedures in good faith, they can be assured they will \nnot be subject to sanctions.\n\n  While the vast majority of employers seek to comply with the law, too \nmany employers turn a blind eye to obvious violations of the law. In \nfact, a small percentage of employers are responsible for a large \npercentage of ``no match'' letters. The General Accounting Office \nreported that between 1985 and the year 2000, only 8,900 employers were \nresponsible for 30 percent of ``no match'' reports.\n  Some of the other statistics in the General Accounting Office report \nare even more troubling. Several employers used one Social Security \nnumber for more than 100 different employees--the same Social Security \nnumber for more than 100 different employees. One employer used a \nsingle Social Security number for 2,580 different wage reports. Mr. \nPresident, 8.9 million wage reports had all zeros for the Social \nSecurity number. In other words, there was no attempt made whatsoever \nto come up with the correct and accurate number, so zeros were offered \nas a Social Security number in 8.9 million wage reports.\n  Mr. President, 43 different employers used the same Social Security \nnumber for more than one employee--for 16 years in a row.\n  The Department of Homeland Security recently conducted the largest \nworksite enforcement raid to date against a company known as IFCO \nSystems, arresting more than 1,000 illegal aliens and charging several \nmanagers with criminal violations.\n  Approximately 53.4 percent of the Social Security numbers for IFCO \nsystems were invalid--half--and Social Security had notified the \ncompany more than 13 times regarding these discrepancies before it \nfinally acted.\n  This regulation will therefore provide guidance to employers who seek \nto comply with the law and will allow the Government to prosecute those \nwho turn a blind eye. But this action by the Department of Homeland \nSecurity is only a Band-Aid for the underlying problem. Employers do \nnot have a reliable method to ascertain whether employees are eligible \nto work in the United States. A paper-based system such as we have now, \nwhere you can use up to 29 different documents, will always be \nvulnerable to fraud and abuse.\n  Electronic verification is the way. It has been tested for more than \n10 years, and an independent review of the program, the so-called basic \npilot program, found that 96 percent of participating employers believe \nthe electronic verification system is an effective tool for employment \nverification. The Senate immigration bill improves upon the current \npaper-based system and requires an expansion of the electronic \nverification system. But the Department of Homeland Security Secretary \nChertoff told me personally that he has problems with some of the \nprovisions in the Senate bill and that, as drafted, he considers it \nunworkable.\n  In my capacity as chairman of the Immigration, Border Security and \nCitizenship Subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I intend to \nhold a hearing in the coming weeks on this critical issue of employment \nverification to make sure we get it right.\n  Twenty years ago Congress sold Americans a bill of goods. They said \nif you will accept the amnesty, then we will have workable worksite \nverifications and sanctions against employers who cheat. Yet today, \nhere we are wrestling with the problem, not of 3 million undocumented \nworkers but 12 million. Obviously, the amnesty without worksite \nverification and employer sanctions is merely a magnet for future \nillegal immigration.\n  I believe Americans are a forgiving people. If someone makes a \nmistake and repents, asks forgiveness and says; I'll try better next \ntime, they are pretty forgiving. But if we are viewed as merely \nrepeating the same mistakes and attempting to trick the American people \ninto accepting another amnesty without actually trying to solve the \nproblem, the consequences for our society and for our national security \nand for our economy will be too great.\n  I will, therefore, continue to work with my colleagues diligently \nduring the conference with the House to develop an employment \nverification system, along with a temporary worker program, that \nreduces employer burdens and protects workers' rights, but which will \nallow us finally, once and for all, to come to grips with our broken \nimmigration system.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/09/senate-section/article/S5682-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5682]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RECOGNITION FOR LINK PIAZZO\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to honor one of Nevada's true \npatriots, Lincoln Piazzo: a Reno native, veteran, businessman, and \nphilanthropist.\n  Link Piazzo is the son of proud Italian immigrants who came to Reno \nin the early 1900s. Link was born in Reno on December 11, 1918. His \nfather was committed to realizing the good life in America and passed \nthis motivation on to his children. Link inherited his father's great \ncommitment to honesty, vision, helping friends, and the belief that \nthere is no country like the United States of America.\n  Link attended Mary S. Doten Elementary School, Northside Junior High \nSchool, and Reno High School. During World War II, he served as a pilot \nin the U.S. Army Air Corps and flew B-25 bombers on 67 combat missions. \nHe is an honored war veteran and a recipient of the Distinguished \nFlying Cross for significant war efforts and achievements.\n  Community involvement has always been a major part of Link Piazzo's \nlife. He has spent a significant time giving to others and contributing \nto his community. He has donated his energy and resources to a number \nof civic and fraternal organizations and is a well-respected citizen of \nthe community. Link volunteered his services as official scorer and \ntimer for high school zone and State basketball tournaments for 33 \nyears. He was a sports broadcaster for the University of Nevada games \nfrom 1945 to 1950 and was co-organizer of the first Reno Little League. \nHe is cofounder of the Reno Junior Ski Program that still continues to \nbenefit local junior skiers.\n  As a northern Nevada community leader, Link has been a member of many \ncivic and social organizations. He has served on the Reno YMCA Board, \nthe Reno Rodeo Association Executive Committee, Sierra Nevada \nSportswriters and Broadcasters Association, National Sporting Goods \nAssociation, the Local United Way Chapter Board, the Board for Hidden \nValley Properties, the Reno Rodeo Association Executive Committee, and \nthe Reno Rotary Club. Link has been honored by the National Sporting \nGoods Association--National Sporting Goods Hall of Fame, and the Washoe \nCounty School District's Outstanding Graduate Award for Outstanding \nCommunity Service.\n  Link has also played a significant role in his community's \ndevelopment. In 1938, he cofounded the Sportsman Store with his \nbrother. He was also codeveloper of the Hidden Valley Country Club and \nGolf Course properties. He has supported the Reno Rotary Club, \nconstruction projects for the Reno High School Alumni Center, the \nNevada Humane Society's Regional Animal Shelter, and the Reno YMCA \nYouth Center.\n  Link's positive outlook on life serves as motivation for all who meet \nhim. He weathered the Great Depression, fought in World War II, and \nhelped to build and then nurture his community and country. Link is a \nvery successful man when success means helping others and helping \nothers achieve. He works hard and has persevered. Link Piazzo is a true \nAmerican patriot and humanitarian.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/09/senate-section/article/S5682-2", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5682-S5683]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          DISCUSSING TAX CUTS\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, in the wake of yet another contentious \ndebate over the size and scope of the Republican tax cuts, I believe \nthat it is high time that this Chamber engages in a serious discussion \nabout the fiscal condition of our Nation and that Senators make an \nobjective assessment of what the economic policies of the last 5\n\n[[Page S5683]]\n\nyears have wrought on our Nation's long-term economic security. It is \ncritically important that we realize that every tax cut we debate or \nenact today, will have a cost for workers and future generations down \nthe road. Despite the best wishes of some Senators, there is no such \nthing as a tax cut that pays for itself and the fiscal profligacy of \nthe last few years will have a dramatic effect on the economic \nopportunities for the next generation of Americans. Indeed, what has \nmade this Nation great is only the result of the commitment of each \ngeneration of Americans to leave a country for their children and \ngrandchildren that was a little better than they found it. We need to \nask whether our economic choices today will enable us to fulfill that \ncommitment.\n  A recent article in U.S. News and World Report magazine has clearly \nlaid out what is at stake with the fiscal decisions that we have made \nand will continue to make in the months and years to come. Therefore, I \nask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From U.S. News and World Report, May 1, 2006]\n\n                         Playing Fair on Taxes\n\n                       (By Mortimer B. Zuckerman)\n\n       Millions of Americans breathe relief at having filed their \n     tax returns. Once again they were face to face with the \n     complexities of compliance, which is why the average American \n     family spends about 26 hours on the task. Every \n     administration promises it will simplify the tax codes, but \n     60 percent of Americans still need professional help, at a \n     cost of $150 billion a year. They are not dummies. They are \n     busy, honest people who have to cope with grotesquely swollen \n     federal tax regulations. The number of rules has risen by \n     over 40 percent in the past four years, from 46,900 in 2000 \n     to 66,498 last year. Is there anyone, really, who can figure \n     out the complicated and tricky alternative minimum tax? \n     Designed to stop rich people from claiming too many \n     deductions, it now ensnares millions of middle-class \n     families.\n       There is no point in expecting Congress to simplify the tax \n     code. Why? Because congressmen need lobbyists to get elected, \n     which means they need millions of dollars, and the lobbyists \n     are intent on inventing new complexities to give tax breaks \n     to well-connected companies and individuals or for \n     fashionable public crusades.\n       Even more lamentably, Congress, over the past five years, \n     has diminished the progressivity of our tax system, which has \n     always required richer people to pay a higher rate than \n     poorer ones. A progressive tax has long supported an \n     expanding middle class and should provide the greatest \n     rewards for the people who work hardest. But the Bush tax \n     cuts have made it less so.\n       The 2001 income tax rate cuts and the 2003 capital-gains \n     and dividends cuts have lowered the average tax rate for the \n     richest one tenth of 1 percent of Americans by 3.8 percent \n     but reduced taxes just .03 percent for the bottom 20 percent. \n     Of the tax savings on investment, the lion's share--more than \n     70 percent--went to the top 2 percent. Of the 90 percent of \n     taxpayers who make less than $100,000, only 14 percent \n     benefited from the dividend-tax cut and only 5 percent from \n     the capital-gains-tax cut. People who own stocks hold them in \n     retirement accounts, which are ineligible for investment \n     relief, and when withdrawn, the profits are reduced by the \n     higher rate applied to wage earnings.\n       In this way, the tax burden on the richest has been reduced \n     to where those who earn $10 million or more pay at a lesser \n     rate than those who earn between $500,000 and $1 million. \n     (And the top 400 pay at an even lower rate!) In part, that's \n     why the share of income going to the top 1 percent of \n     Americans has jumped from 9 percent to 14 percent of our \n     national income, an increase of 50 percent. It is \n     inequitable, reprehensible, absurd, and unfair. Is it any \n     wonder that an NBC News / Wall Street Journal poll last year \n     found that most Americans, 54 percent, believed the Bush tax \n     cuts weren't worth it?\n       Class warfare? Yes, these cuts have helped stimulate the \n     economy. But they have also turned the impressive fiscal \n     surplus when President Clinton left office into a long-term \n     budget deficit now trillions of dollars, of which about 60 \n     percent can be attributed to the ``Bush effect.'' These \n     deficits are mortgaging workers'' future pay gains to fund \n     baby boomers' retirement payments.\n       And they're being financed with borrowed money, which will \n     have to be repaid, with interest, by taxpayers of the future. \n     All of this as we face an aging population that will drive up \n     the cost of government retirement programs with serious \n     consequences for our future living standards in the form of \n     higher taxes or lower benefits. Social Security will provide \n     less of a safety net; Medicare will not be able to guarantee \n     healthcare to older Americans; and Medicaid will no longer be \n     able to help the poor.\n       The tax cuts on investment income should not be extended \n     after they expire in 2010. One argument in favor of keeping \n     the cuts in place is that eliminating them would hurt \n     economic growth. Yet, when President Clinton raised the \n     marginal rate on high incomes, the opposite occurred: \n     Unemployment dropped without causing inflation; productivity \n     and growth accelerated to levels not seen since the 1960s, \n     and the budget deficit was converted to an impressive \n     surplus. Government borrowing stopped draining the capital \n     markets, freeing up money for private investment.\n       Nor can it be said that taking these new tax cuts from the \n     wealthy would amount to class warfare. It is hardly class \n     warfare to suggest that some of the $750 billion a year that \n     the top 10 percent of income earners are taking in now should \n     go to sustain the fiscal health of the country and the \n     expansion of our middle class and to maintain America as a \n     true land of opportunity.\n       Remember that job security, private pensions, and employer-\n     provided healthcare coverage are being cut back. Remember \n     that there is significant erosion in public services such as \n     schools, colleges, transportation, health, recreation, and \n     job training. Understand why large numbers of people in our \n     society are feeling increasingly vulnerable. It is time to \n     redress the balance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/09/senate-section/article/S5683-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5683]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n            100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE SPANGLER CANDY COMPANY\n\n Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, today I recognize an outstanding \nachievement resulting from a century of hard work and perseverance. \nThis August, the Spangler Candy Company, a family-owned business based \nin Bryan, OH, will be celebrating its 100th birthday. This is quite a \nmilestone--a testament to Spangler's commitment to its customers and \ncommunity.\n  On August 20, 1906, Arthur Spangler purchased the Gold Leaf Baking \nCompany in Defiance, OH, for $450 and moved the operations to Bryan. \nThe Spangler Manufacturing Company was born, originally producing \nbaking soda, baking powder, corn starch, laundry starch, spices, and \nflavorings. Arthur's brother, Ernest, joined the company 2 years later \nand suggested adding candy to the production line. This proved to be an \nexcellent idea. In 1920, the name changed from the Spangler \nManufacturing Company to the Spangler Candy Company. Since that time, \nthe Spangler Candy Company has remained a family-owned and operated \nbusiness and maintains the values that made it so successful--hard work \nand innovation.\n  In 2001, an outside warehouse fire at Oberhaus Enterprises in \nArchibold, OH, destroyed 110,000 cases of Spangler products at a value \nof $6.5 million. This disaster could very easily have destroyed the \nSpangler spirit, but instead, it only made the organization stronger. \nToday, the Spangler Candy Company employs about 400 people in the \nUnited States and is a global leader in confectionary production and \nsales. The company has helped many Ohioans build their dreams, while at \nthe same time, the Spangler Corporation has achieved the American \ndream.\n  So today I salute the Spangler Corporation for a century of demanding \nwork, inspiration, and commitment to the northwest Ohio area. I wish \nthem all the best for the next 100 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/09/senate-section/article/S5683-2", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5683]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/09/senate-section/article/S5683-3", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5683]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/09/senate-section/article/S5683-4", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5683-S5684]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second times by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Mr. COBURN (for himself, Mr. DeMint, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. \n             Cornyn, and Mr. Vitter):\n       S. 3488.

A bill to provide loans and grants for fire sprinkler \nretrofitting in nursing facilities; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to introduce bipartisan legislation \nwith my colleague from North Carolina, Senator Burr, that seeks to \nprotect nursing home residents, staff, and visitors from the dangers \nassociated with fire.\n  In February, 2003, a multialarm fire at a nursing home in Hartford, \nCT, took the lives of 16 residents. It was the worst nursing home fire \nin Connecticut's history. The tragic loss of life was made worse by the \nfact that the nursing home lacked an automatic sprinkler system--a \ndefect disturbingly present in many nursing homes across the country.\n  I believe many Americans--especially those with a loved one in a \nnursing home facility--would be shocked to learn that, according to the \nGovernment Accountability Office, GAO, between 20 and 30 percent of the \ncountry's 17,000 nursing homes lack an automatic sprinkler system. In \nits 2004 report, the GAO found that ``the substantial loss of life in \nthe [Hartford fire] could have been reduced or eliminated by the \npresence of properly functioning automatic sprinkler systems.'' \nFurthermore, the report concluded that ``the Federal oversight of \nnursing home compliance with fire safety standards is inadequate.''\n  Responding to the fire in Hartford and a similar tragedy in \nNashville, TN, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, \nrequired that nursing homes without automatic sprinkler systems install \nbattery-operated smoke detectors. While this new requirement was viewed \nas a positive step, it was largely criticized by fire and patient-\nsafety advocates because smoke detectors are often not wired to a \ncentral alarm system or a fire department.\n  I believe it is safe to assume that nursing home directors do not \nchoose freely to operate their facilities without automatic sprinkler \nsystems. According to the GAO and American Health Care Association, \nmost nursing homes simply cannot afford the cost incurred by installing \nan automatic sprinkler system. Furthermore, almost all of these \nfacilities cannot afford the cost because of forces beyond their \ncontrol. Today, nursing homes--including many in Connecticut--are \nfinancially strained by inadequate reimbursement rates from Medicare \nand Medicaid, rising insurance premiums, rising energy costs, and the \ngeneral cost of care for some of our country's sickest patients.\n  That is why Senator Burr and I are introducing this legislation. The \nNursing Home Fire Safety Act of 2006 contains two principal components.\n  First, the legislation includes a resolution expressing the sense of \nCongress that, within 5 years, every nursing home facility in the \nUnited States should be equipped with an automatic sprinkler system. \nThe resolution also urges CMS to adopt the National Fire Protection \nAssociation's Life Safety Code, a nationally-renowned set of criteria \naddressing ``construction, protection, and occupancy features necessary \nto minimize danger to life from fire, including smoke, fumes, or \npanic.''\n  Second, the legislation provides low-interest loans and grants to \nnursing homes in proven need of financial assistance. The larger loan \ninitiative assists nursing homes that cannot afford the upfront costs \nof installing automatic sprinkler systems but can afford to pay back a \nlow-interest Government loan. The smaller grant initiative would assist \nqualified nursing homes that lack any ability to pay for the \ninstallation of an automatic sprinkler system. Together, these \ninitiatives would provide critical resources to prevent tragedies like \nthose seen in Hartford and Nashville from occurring again.\n  I thank my colleague from North Carolina, Senator Burr, for \nintroducing this bipartisan measure with me. I also thank Congressmen \nJohn Larson from Connecticut and Peter King from New York for \nspearheading companion legislation in the House. I look forward to \nworking with all of my colleagues to protect nursing home residents, \nstaff, and visitors from the dangers associated with fire.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the legislation be \nprinted in the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3489\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE .\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Nursing Home Fire Safety Act \n     of 2006''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n\n[[Page S5685]]\n\n       (1) An estimated 1,500,000 Americans reside in \n     approximately 16,300 nursing facilities nationwide, an \n     estimated 20 to 30 percent of which lack an automatic fire \n     sprinkler system.\n       (2) In a July 2004 report, the Government Accountability \n     Office found that ``the substantial loss of life in [recent \n     nursing home] fires could have been reduced or eliminated by \n     the presence of properly functioning automatic sprinkler \n     systems'' and that ``Federal oversight of nursing home \n     compliance with fire safety standards is inadequate''.\n       (3) Many nursing facilities lack the financial capital to \n     install sprinklers on their own and must consider closure as \n     an alternative to taking on large loans or other financing \n     options in order to install sprinklers.\n       (4) Recognizing that automatic fire sprinkler systems \n     greatly improve the chances of survival for older adults in \n     the event of a fire, the National Fire Protection \n     Association, with the support of the American Health Care \n     Association, the fire safety community, and the nursing \n     facility profession, recently issued the 2006 edition of the \n     Life Safety Code which requires automatic sprinklers in all \n     existing nursing facilities.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) within 5 years, every nursing facility in America \n     should be equipped with automatic fire sprinklers in order to \n     ensure patient, resident, and staff safety;\n       (2) the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) \n     should quickly adopt the 2006 edition of the Life Safety \n     Code, recently issued by the National Fire Protection \n     Association with the support of the nursing home industry, \n     which includes the requirement that all nursing facilities be \n     fully sprinklered; and\n       (3) the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, in \n     collaboration with Congress, should take into consideration \n     the costs of retrofitting existing nursing home facilities \n     and commit itself to providing facilities with the critical \n     financial resources necessary to ensure the speedy and full \n     installation of life saving sprinkler systems.\n\n     SEC. 3. DIRECT LOANS FOR FIRE SPRINKLERS RETROFITS.\n\n       (a) Authority.--Not later than 120 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services shall establish a program of direct loans to \n     existing nursing facilities to finance retrofitting the \n     facilities with an automatic fire sprinkler system. Such \n     loans shall be made under terms and conditions specified by \n     the Secretary.\n       (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized \n     to be appropriated to carry out this section such sums as may \n     be necessary for each of fiscal years 2007 through 2011.\n\n     SEC. 4. SPRINKLER RETROFIT ASSISTANCE GRANTS.\n\n       (a) Authority.--Not later than 120 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services shall establish a program to award grants to nursing \n     facilities for the purposes of retrofitting them with an \n     automatic fire sprinkler system. Such grants shall be awarded \n     under terms and conditions specified by the Secretary.\n       (b) Priority.--In awarding grants under this section, the \n     Secretary shall give a priority to applications that \n     demonstrate a need or hardship. In determining hardship, the \n     Secretary may take into account factors such as the number of \n     residents who are entitled to or enrolled in the medicare \n     program under title 18 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n     1395 et seq.) or receiving assistance under the medicaid \n     program under title 19 of such Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.), \n     the age and condition of the facility, and the need for \n     nursing facility beds in the community involved.\n       (c) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized \n     to be appropriated to carry out this section such sums as may \n     be necessary for each of fiscal years 2007 through 2011.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/09/senate-section/article/S5685-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5685]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n EXPRESSING CONDOLENCES TO FAMILIES OF VICTIMS OF INDONESIAN EARTHQUAKE\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
