Mr. President, from the book of Matthew, chapter 7, verses \n25, 26, and 27 of the King James version of the Bible, I read as \nfollows:\n\n       And the rain descended and the floods came and the winds \n     blew and beat upon the house, and it fell not for it was \n     founded upon a rock. And everyone that heareth these sayings \n     of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish \n     man, which built his house upon the sand. And the rain \n     descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat \n     upon that house; and it fell; and great was the fall of it.\n\n  Mr. President, 70 years ago the Social Security Program was founded \nupon a rock. It was designed to shelter workers in their old age and to \nwithstand the storms that can wipe away their savings. For 70 years, \nthe Social Security Program has stood as a protector of workers and \nfamilies. It is their safeguard against economic peril.\n  Social Security provides the essential support for 405,000 West \nVirginians. In every county across the State, men and women, workers \nand retirees, their spouses and their children rely on their monthly \nSocial Security check, and it comes as regularly as the mail man runs.\n  And so it is with great trepidation that they listen to apocalyptic \ntales about Social Security's future. It is difficult to understand, \nand perhaps incomprehensible to comprehend, how workers could spend \ntheir lifetime contributing to the Social Security Program only to find \nthat the benefits promised to them may not be available when they \nretire. Demographic projections show that the next generation of \nworkers cannot support the retirement and disability benefits promised \nto this generation of workers. The Social Security trustees warned us \nthat this demographic storm would erode the rock upon which the \nretirement security of workers has been built. Soon the rain will \ndescend. Soon the floods will come. Soon the winds will blow. Our \nchallenge is to keep that house from falling. And our challenge is \ngreat.\n\n  It is within this context that President Bush has proposed changing \nthe scope of the Social Security Program, adding personal accounts to \nwean workers from the traditional program. He offers the opportunity \nfor higher returns in the financial markets in exchange for workers \nrelinquishing a portion of their benefits guaranteed under the current \nsystem. Be careful.\n  Needless to say, the outcry to such a proposal has been deafening. In \nthe State of West Virginia, thousands and thousands of constituents are \ncontacting my office--phone calls, e-mails, letters--in opposition to \nthe President's Social Security plan. These people fear that personal \naccounts are a scheme to take away their Social Security benefits. They \nfear it is an effort to crack open Social Security and break it apart, \npiece by piece. I, too, fear such efforts. Feeding that fear is the \nsecret that permeates the administration's plans.\n  The X factors are multifarious, impacting every worker and every \nemployer who pays into the Social Security Program, every future \nretiree and every future disabled worker who expects one day to receive \nSocial Security benefits.\n  My constituents are right to be leery of a scheme to privatize Social \nSecurity, particularly when efforts to learn more about Social \nSecurity's reforms are being stonewalled. We cannot get that \ninformation. If we knew the answers, if we knew for certain the \nretirement security of our constituents would be protected, that would \nbe one thing, but this proposal for personal accounts seems a lot like \nthe kind of telephone scams we hear about when folks are told they have \nwon a prize and then are asked for their bank account number. Hold on \nhere.\n  We are all enticed by the idea of ensuring the solvency of Social \nSecurity, but what are workers being asked to give up? No one in the \nadministration, no one in the White House is willing to tell. Hear me \nwhen I say I will oppose this plan as well as any plan where the costs \nare undefined and the benefit cuts so uncertain.\n  Four months of high-publicity tours and photo-ops by President Bush \nand members of his Cabinet all across America, including stops in West \nVirginia, have yielded little new information about how the President's \nplan would affect workers' benefits. We do not know. We have not been \ntold. We cannot get the answers. We ask for the\n\n[[Page S4448]]\n\nplan, we ask for the details, and nothing happens. What level of \nbenefit cuts is the President advocating? How much of their guaranteed \nbenefits is the President asking workers to relinquish? On this subject \nthe White House has been evasive. The White House has been \nequivocating.\n  What about the volatility of the financial markets? Recent news \nreports serve as a vivid reminder that the stock market has severe ups \nand downs. What happens when it comes time to retire and a worker \ndiscovers that he or she does not have enough saved to ensure a decent, \nrespectable living? What guarantee would the administration support to \nensure a minimum benefit from each individual account? The White House \nwill not respond to this question. There is not a sound to be heard by \nway of answering that question. What are the costs of the President's \nSocial Security plan? The White House Budget Office has $754 billion, \nbut the Vice President says trillions of dollars. How about that? How \ncan this administration reconcile mounting debt and its own warnings \nabout the need to limit the further growth of deficits with a plan that \nrequires borrowing trillions of dollars more? Again, the White House \nhas no response to the question.\n  This week, the Senate Finance Committee began hearings on the \nPresident's plan. I hope these hearings will yield more information. \nOur senior citizens need answers to these questions.\n  I sent a letter to this President earlier this year urging him to \nsend a detailed legislative proposal to the Congress. Send it up, a \ndetailed legislative proposal. I have asked questions of the Secretary \nof the Treasury at Appropriations Committee hearings as recently as \nthis week. The Congress and the people have been patient in waiting for \nanswers, but still no answers come forth. Honesty and candor are now \nrequired. We cannot legislate on rumors and guesses. The ducking and \nthe dodging on the part of the administration serve only to fuel \nspeculation that it is hiding something--yes, hiding something--from \nthe public or, worse, seeking to cut benefits surreptitiously.\n  Fortunately, any legislation submitted by the President to change \nSocial Security will require 60 votes to pass the Senate; that is, as \nlong as the nuclear option has not descended upon the Senate, as long \nas the filibuster is still around. Any legislation submitted by the \nPresident to change Social Security will require 60 votes to pass the \nSenate. Long live the filibuster. It may be needed to protect Social \nSecurity. The danger of the nuclear option becomes crystal clear as we \ncontemplate the momentous debate on Social Security which looms just \ndown the road, just up ahead.\n\n  Only the Senate, here in this forum, only the Senate has the ability \nto insist on its right to unlimited debate. I hope the Senators will \nstop, look, and listen. Only the Senate, may I repeat, has the ability \nto insist on its right to unlimited debate. Let's maintain that right. \nIt has been there for 217 years. Its roots go back to the English Bill \nof Rights to which William III and Mary subscribed on February 13, \n1689, 100 years before our own Republic began, the Bill of Rights, \nenacted on December 16 in Parliament. The Bill of Rights guaranteed \nfreedom of speech in commons, and our own Constitution in section 6, \narticle I, guarantees that right which cannot be questioned in any \nother place. Retain it, maintain it, keep it, hold it, collapse it to \nthy breast.\n  Only the Senate has the ability to insist on its right to unlimited \ndebate. No Social Security legislation will fly through this Senate \nwithout thorough scrutiny, unless the nuclear option is employed. \nSenators can insist and Senators will insist on the time they need to \nprobe the details of the President's plan and to extract answers to \ntheir questions. The Senate will have the opportunity to amend, the \nSenate will have the opportunity to debate, and then, if it desires, \nthe Senate will have the opportunity to amend and debate some more. And \nthen some more. The threat of a filibuster means that no legislation \nwill be enacted into law without bipartisan support in this Senate, \nwhich means that no benefits will be cut, no taxes will be increased, \nand no radical change codified without adequate debate.\n  The Senate will require a compromise if and when Social Security \nreforms are ever enacted, fulfilling its role exactly as the Founding \nFathers envisioned. Yes, yes, that is why we have a Senate. Thank God \nfor the Great Compromise which was agreed to on July 16, 1787. Praise \nGod for that Great Compromise. But for it, the Presiding Officer would \nnot be sitting at the desk. But for it, I would not be standing here. \nBut for it, this might never have been a Republic. That is why we have \na Senate with its rules for unlimited debate--Lord, God, keep it, save \nit, collapse it to thy heart--to forge compromise and to ensure \nmoderation in the laws enacted.\n  To those who advocate chipping away at that rule, limiting Senators' \nright to debate in regard to judicial nominees, hear me when I say the \ncrucial need for keeping those rules strong in order to encourage \ncompromise and moderation is right before us as the Senate proposes to \ndebate changes in Social Security. Hear me out there in the Plains, in \nthe prairies, across the rivers from the Atlantic to the Pacific. We \nought to engage in a genuine effort to end the rumors and help the \npublic understand exactly what is being asked of them with regard to \ntheir Social Security benefits--your benefits.\n  I urge this administration to lay its case before the American \npeople. Come on, open up, lay the case before the American people. Tell \nus what your plan is. Give us the details of your plan. The last thing \nwe need at this late point with the Social Security storm looming on \nthe horizon is to find another house has been built upon the sand.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, how much time remains on the minority \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority's time is now expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, do I understand that the Senator from \nNew Mexico has up to 10 minutes at this point in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has up to 30 minutes, if he would \nlike.\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Madam President and fellow Senators, I want to start by \nsubmitting a couple of editorials from papers in the State of New \nMexico.\n  First of all, I want to start with an editorial from a paper in New \nMexico called the Santa Fe New Mexican. I do not want to editorialize \ntoo much about this paper, but I think it is fair to say this is not a \nconservative newspaper. I believe it is fair to say it is a pretty \nliberal paper. It is probably even more than mildly liberal, very \nliberal. But I was impressed by their grasp of this issue and a \nstatement that was in their editorial.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that these editorials be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [Santa Fe New Mexican (New Mexico), Feb. 24, 2003]\n\n             Bingaman Should Lead Dems' Filibuster Retreat\n\n       As legendary prizefighter Joe Louis said of an upcoming \n     opponent reputed to be fast on his feet: ``He can run, but he \n     can't hide.''\n       Senate Democrats, along with the Republican majority, fled \n     Washington last week as their way of honoring Presidents' \n     Day. The annual recess suspended their filibuster against a \n     federal judgeship vote. The Dems are making an unwarranted \n     stand, and an unseemly fuss, over the nomination of Miguel \n     Estrada to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.\n       The filibuster--protracted talking under senatorial \n     privilege--had consumed a week of debate about Estrada before \n     the senators left town. Now they're gravitating back to the \n     Potomac, and the Dems can hide no longer. Resumption of their \n     verbose balking will make them look ridiculous--at a time \n     when the nation needs statesmen to stand up\n\n[[Page S4449]]\n\n     against the White House warmonger and his partisans \n     commanding Capitol Hill.\n       The Democrats have chosen a particularly poor target: \n     Estrada, who came from Honduras as a boy and went on to lead \n     his law class at Harvard, is better qualified than many a \n     Democratic appointee now holding life tenure on one federal \n     bench or another.\n       But after confirming so many less-qualified judges while \n     they held power, Estrada's senatorial tormentors now offer \n     ``reasons'' why he shouldn't be confirmed: too young; too \n     bashful about answering leading questions; appointed only \n     because he's Hispanic--or, to some senators' way of thinking, \n     not Hispanic enough.\n       What really rankles with the Democrats, though, is \n     Estrada's politics. He's a conservative. Surprise, surprise; \n     we've got a conservative president, and it's the president \n     who makes the appointments to the federal judiciary.\n       As the party on the outs, the Dems had better get used to \n     like-minded appointments from the president. If their game-\n     playing goes on, a disgusted American public might keep \n     George W. Bush in office for the next six years. The country \n     certainly didn't see any reason to balance Bush against a \n     Democratic Congress when it had a chance just a few months \n     ago. With their spiteful behavior toward Bush appointees, the \n     Dems aren't exactly gaining goodwill.\n       If they find the Republican so repugnant, let 'em vote \n     against him; at least they'll be putting their ideals--or \n     their party colors--on display. But this is no Mr. Smith \n     against some diabolical establishment; it's a bunch of sore \n     losers making themselves even more so.\n       To break a filibuster by cloture takes 60 senators. The \n     Senate's 51 Republicans need nine of the 48 Democrats, or \n     eight of them and ex-Republican Jim Jeffords of Vermont.\n       New Mexico's Jeff Bingaman should lead the Democratic \n     blockade-runners. By all measures, Bingaman is a class act; a \n     lawyer who knows that senators have no business \n     obstructing appointments on purely political grounds. He \n     also knows that Republicans aren't going to hold the White \n     House forever; that sooner or later a Democratic president \n     will be choosing judges. And he realizes that Republicans, \n     like their mascot, have long memories.\n       The last thing our justice system needs is an ongoing feud \n     over appointments to district and appellate judgeships. Let \n     Judge Estrada's confirmation be a landmark of partisan \n     politics' retreat from the courtroom.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                  [Albuquerque Journal, Apr. 27, 2005]\n\n                Filibuster Puts Bar Too High for Judges\n\n       Despite the cumbersome robes, Texas Supreme Court Justice \n     Priscilla Owen has managed to jump some pretty high bars. She \n     garnered 84 percent of the vote in her 2000 campaign for re-\n     election. She received the American Bar Association's highest \n     rating as a nominee for the federal appeals court.\n       But since 2001, she hasn't been able to get the time of day \n     on the Senate floor because Democrats will filibuster \n     confirmation. That means Owen has to have a super majority of \n     60 votes--the number it takes to close off a filibuster. That \n     bar is too high.\n       Democrats like to stress the number of U.S. District Court \n     judges confirmed during the Bush administration. But the \n     higher courts are the battleground, and there, Democrats have \n     been able to hold Bush's confirmation rate (69 percent) well \n     below that of recent presidents.\n       The Senate minority has used the filibuster or the threat \n     of it on an unprecedented scale to deny Owen and 15 other \n     appeals level nominees what the Constitution envisions, a \n     straight majority vote.\n       Despite the time-honored Senate rule establishing senators' \n     right to hold the floor and talk until death or until 60 \n     votes can be rounded up, the time-honored norm has been to \n     defer to the president, especially when the president's party \n     holds a Senate majority.\n       What happens when traditions are trampled in the interest \n     of short-term political goals? Other customs that have worked \n     well become vulnerable to the escalating partisan crossfire \n     over judicial nominees. For example, Judiciary Committee \n     practice has been not to send a nomination to the floor \n     without the accord of the senators from the nominee's state. \n     Now that rule has been broken in the case of Michigan \n     nominees.\n       The next level of escalation wasn't too hard to see coming: \n     The majority party threatens to remove the filibuster option \n     on judicial nominees. If that sounds radical, consider that \n     19 Democrats--including Sens. John Kerry, Edward Kennedy, \n     Barbara Boxer and Jeff Bingaman--moved to eliminate the \n     filibuster in 1995 when Democrats wielded majority power.\n       What they failed to do then, they may goad the Republican \n     majority into accomplishing with regard to judicial \n     nominations now. It would be an action both parties \n     eventually could come to regret. The filibuster has allowed \n     the minority to apply the brakes to majority will over the \n     decades--but it was not intended to be a stone wall.\n       Senate leaders should keep talking and trying to avert a \n     showdown on the filibuster. Democrats might negotiate for a \n     Bush pledge to forgo recess appointments, to seek more pre-\n     nomination advice along with Senate consent, and for expanded \n     floor debate.\n       But, after every senator has had his moment on the floor, \n     there should be a straight majority vote on the vast majority \n     of this or any other president's nominees.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I want to read the operative paragraph \nfrom the Santa Fe New Mexican:\n\n       With this spiteful behavior toward Bush appointees, the \n     Dems aren't exactly gaining goodwill.\n       If they find [these nominees] so repugnant, let 'em vote \n     against [them]; at least they'll be putting their ideals--or \n     their party colors--on display. But this is no Mr. Smith \n     against some diabolical establishment; it's a bunch of sore \n     losers making themselves even more so. . . .\n\n  This is not Pete Domenici speaking. I am reading from this editorial:\n\n       The last thing our justice system needs is an ongoing feud \n     over appointments to district and appellate judgeships.\n\n  Now, yesterday, or maybe a day before, the major paper in the State, \nthe Albuquerque Journal, had an editorial with a very interesting \ntitle: ``Filibuster Puts Bar [B-A-R] Too High for Judges.''\n  It is a very interesting editorial, with a play on words: ``Bar'' \nmeaning the bench; and ``Bar,'' with the idea that you have to have 60 \nvotes, is disavowed by this editorial. There is some nice recognition \nand discussion about the fact that a number of the Senators on the \nother side who are talking about this issue as if there was a \nfilibuster allowed for judges--which I do not believe there is--the \neditorial explains that a number of Democrats were for doing away with \nthe filibuster in its entirety about 10 years ago. At a point, that was \na very major discussion here, and it was principally motivated by the \nDemocratic Party, to get rid of the filibuster in its entirety. The \neditorial says how interesting and paradoxical it is that some of those \nwho did not, at the time, want the filibuster around at all are arguing \nabout it existing for judges--this is not conclusive but is \ninteresting.\n  So I am here because I would like to make my case and explain to the \nSenate why this Senator from New Mexico thinks we should have an up-or-\ndown vote on the circuit court judicial nominees of the President who \nare pending.\n  First, I want to make the point that I am not trying to change \nanything. So when people say, Republican Senators want to change the \nfilibuster rule, I am for changing nothing.\n  What does that mean? That means I am for leaving the rule as it is. \nWhat does that mean? That means there is no filibuster rule relating to \njudges now. All the discussion about why should we change the rule is \nnot the issue. The issue is, why are we denying circuit court judges an \nup-or-down vote--that is, majority rule--when that is what the \nprecedent of the Senate has been for the last 200-plus years?\n  For anybody who thinks the filibuster rule is absolutely inherent in \nanything the Senate does, that the rule came down from the Constitution \nto the Senate as: Thou shalt have a filibuster rule, that is not so. \nLook in the Constitution. There is no mention of filibusters. As a \nmatter of fact, the document is filled with references to majority \nrule. And where the Constitution requires that we have more than a \nmajority, it says so. So look to the Constitution to see if there are \nany times when our Founding Fathers said a two-thirds vote or more than \na simple majority are necessary, and you will find there are few \noccasions and they are mentioned specifically. Therefore, I would \nassume the Constitution does not require super-majorities for judicial \nnominees. If we tried to say otherwise, I assume it would be thrown out \nin a minute.\n  The question then is, what do we Republicans want? What do--maybe it \nwon't all be Republicans in the end--we want now? We want judges who \nwere nominated by this President for the circuit courts of appeal over \na long period of time--and I will cite an example shortly--to have an \nup-or-down vote. I hope people understand, all these other questions \nthat are asked of them, they beg the issue. The issue is, should a \ncircuit court nominee who is otherwise qualified, meaning the American \nBar Association and the people who work with them believe they are \nqualified, have a vote. That is the issue.\n  I cannot believe the majority of Americans, given that set of facts, \nwould say no, you need to get two-thirds of the vote under those \ncircumstances. What are those circumstances? Those circumstances are \nthat some in this body don't like the\n\n[[Page S4450]]\n\nnominees. The Constitution didn't say this is an issue of whether you \nlike the nominees. It said, you are voting advice and consent for the \nnominee. So the point is, you exercise your right by saying: I don't \nconsent. In advising, I withhold my consent and say no. The \nConstitution doesn't say two-thirds of you must say you have advised \nand you consent. That is the issue.\n  As I see it on television and read about it, we can see people \narguing that we shouldn't change. The filibuster is part of the fiber \nof the Senate. We should not alter it.\n  I have explained that it isn't part of the fiber of the Senate with \nregards to judicial nominees. As a matter of fact, even on other issues \nbesides judges, it is not certain that it existed when we were founded. \nThere is a long period of history when we are not even sure the \nfilibuster existed. But I am not here saying the filibuster does not \nnow exist. In fact, I am for the filibuster. I didn't vote in favor of \ngetting rid of the filibuster. Half of my service in this body has been \nas a minority Senator. So I know what it is to be a minority Member who \nappreciates the filibuster. But I also don't like the filibuster \nsometimes. I get upset. I wonder why it holds up so much legislation.\n  I might add parenthetically that I don't like the way the filibuster \nis used around here now because it is used all the time for anything. \nThirty times a year we have to have cloture filed. We didn't do that \nfor 25 of the 30 years I have been here. It was very rare. In its \nearliest vintage, it was on matters of monumental importance to \nSenators, regions, or to Americans. Now every time we have a bill, if a \nfew people say, we don't want to let that pass, you have a filibuster.\n  I am not for changing the filibuster because of irreverence toward \nthe Senate's right to vote. I don't think I am voting to change it when \nI talk about judges, because you don't change if you are trying to say, \ndo what we have been doing. I have tried my best to read, first, what \nis a filibuster. I have checked and I have read. I understand.\n\n  How do you get rid of it? I checked and I understand how you get rid \nof a filibuster. But I have also tried to find out when are filibusters \nused, and I have found that in the Senate it is not generally used with \nreference to voting on a nominee for Federal judgeships in the United \nStates.\n  I am not in favor of our leadership pursuing a process that gives us \nan up-or-down vote, if that process gets rid of the filibuster for \neverything. I have already inquired. I am assured that is not the case. \nI have been assured we won't be voting on that. It will be only \nregarding judges.\n  So have we in the past filibustered judges? By that I mean, had a \njudge come down to the floor out of committee ready to be voted on and \nhave we killed that judge's chance by filibustering? No, no. Never, \nnever. One case is cited, and it is Abe Fortas.\n  Abe Fortas was a Lyndon Johnson appointee who was on the bench, \nalready confirmed. The issue was, President Johnson wanted to put him \nin a vacancy that occurred for Chief Justice which you know we have to \nvote on. And the Senate got into a debate about whether he should get \nit, and there was great consternation on the floor of the Senate as to \nwhether he should be confirmed for that. The truth is, he was not \nkilled by filibuster. His name was voluntarily withdrawn. He later even \nleft the Supreme Court. But the record is pretty certain that he was \nnot killed by filibuster. That wasn't a judicial appointment, anyway. \nBut even if you want to tie that in, that did not happen.\n  What have Senators around here said about this? I understand each can \ncome down here and put it in whatever context they would like. My good \nfriend, Senator Kennedy from Massachusetts, said on February 3, 1998, \npage S295 of the Congressional Record:\n\n       We owe it to Americans across the country to give these \n     nominees a vote. If our Republican colleagues don't like \n     them, vote against them. But give them a vote.\n\n  That is not me. That is Senator Kennedy.\n  Senator Leahy said, June 8, 1998, page S6521 of the Congressional \nRecord:\n\n       I would object and fight against any filibuster on a judge, \n     whether it is somebody I opposed or supported . . .\n\n  Interesting. I have seen the distinguished Senator from New York--I \nhaven't heard him personally, but I have seen him and heard him on \ntelevision with his right fist like this saying: We don't need any \nright wing judges or we don't need the right wing pushing us to appoint \nradical judges.\n  I could as well put up my left hand, but I won't, and say we don't \nneed anybody telling us to appoint liberal judges. But the \ndistinguished Senator from New York said:\n\n       This delay makes a mockery of the Constitution, makes a \n     mockery of the fact that we are here working, and makes a \n     mockery of the lives of very sincere people who have put \n     themselves forward to be judges and then they hang out there \n     in limbo.\n\n  That is dated March 7, 2000, page S1211 of the Congressional Record. \nI also told you about the New Mexico editorials.\n  So people will understand how gross this abuse of the filibuster is \nand how it is prompted by personal angst, not qualifications, I am \ngoing to refer to one judge as an example. Let's take the nominee \nPriscilla Owen, Fifth Circuit, and let's look at her in comparison with \njudges who are on that court who have come before the Senate. Let's \nlook at the first one, Patrick Higginbotham, nominated by Ronald \nReagan, graduate of the University of Alabama, University of Alabama \nLaw School. How long did it take to get through here? Twenty-six days. \nNominee Emilio Garza, President Bush appointee, University of Notre \nDame, University of Texas Law School, judicial experience, Bexar County \nTexas District Court.\n\n  I am sure controversial people had a thing to say, but I am also sure \nthis and the previous nominee were recommended or were certified to be \nqualified by the American Bar which, incidentally, most of the time \nthis Senator has been here, that was the sine qua non. If you didn't \nhave that, you were in trouble. And if you had it, conversely, that was \npretty good. You must be qualified. That is what the old rule was. I am \nsure they had that. Forty-three days for him to be confirmed.\n  Here we have Fortunato Benavides, nominated by President Clinton, \nUniversity of Houston, University of Houston Law School, previous \nexperience, 13th Court of Appeals for Texas, Texas Criminal Court of \nAppeals, 99 days to be confirmed. He got nominated and confirmed in 99 \ndays. There was a lot of commotion about him. He got here for a vote.\n  Now we have Priscilla Owen, George W. Bush's nominee, Baylor \nUniversity, Baylor University School of Law, Texas Supreme Court, 1994 \nto the present. Both of these nominees were qualified, according to the \nAmerican Bar, both of these, Mr. Benavides, Judge Owen, a lot of \nletters of commendation from those who know about their judicial \ntemperament, their qualifications. I told you where she came from, \nwhere she was educated, where she served. Look at the time she's been \nwaiting for a vote--I know Americans will better understand our \ndilemma--1,450 days waiting for us to say what the American people I \nbelieve would like us to say, and what I think the Constitution says we \nought to say, and that is yes or no. Not maybe; not, ``well, I don't \nlike their ideals so you need 60 votes.'' That is a pretty long time to \nleave a qualified judge hanging here unless you are absolutely certain \nthat person is not qualified to be a judge.\n  There is a lot more one can say about this, but I believe, as one who \nhas been here a long time--I think right now there are only four people \nhere sitting longer than I in the Senate--we should get this over with.\n  This is hanging over the Senate in a very damaging way. With the \npassing of each day, more and more is said, more and more joining sides \nis taking place, digging in your feet, more and more groups outside are \nadding to the vitriolic nature of the debate. The talking heads--the \nnews people who talk all the time on TV and speak on radio and write \nall the time--are choosing sides. They are feeding a frenzy, and we are \nsuffering. But most of all, the American people are suffering because \nif we keep on, it is going to be hard to get our work done.\n  I close by saying that our friends on the other side are led by a \nSenator whom I honestly and sincerely say is a good leader for the \nminority, Senator\n\n[[Page S4451]]\n\nHarry Reid, an excellent Senator--I believe he is fair and honest. I \nbelieve he would like to get this issue out of his mind and out of \nhere. But he has suggested that if the majority party insists on doing \nwhat we are entitled to do--voting for these judges up or down by a \nmajority vote--if we do that, which, I repeat, is not changing \nanything, the business of America will stop. We will pass nothing here. \nThe Senate will be dead. America's business will go nowhere; it will \ndisappear. That is an extraordinary threat, a threat that those who are \nmaking it better clearly understand.\n  Does that really mean that we won't get a highway bill, an energy \nbill, an appropriations bill that pays for education, a bill that pays \nfor the operation of our military, that we won't get an appropriations \nbill through here that pays for our parks, for the Indian schools of \nour country, and on and on? Have we really reached a point where the \nminority is saying, we are going to insist on enforcing a rule that \ndoesn't exist, that denies an up-or-down vote on judges who are \nqualified, and if we don't get our way, Government stops?\n  You know, I hope everybody understands that. I hope it doesn't \nhappen. I think that editorial I read from suggests that those who do \nthat are not going to come out of this with any accolades--nobody is \ngoing to be proud of that. I believe that is almost a minimum way of \nsaying it. I think that will inure to the minority party being \nconsidered to be irresponsible on behalf of the people of this country.\n  I thank the Senate for listening, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I commend Senator Domenici for his \nremarks and for his service and commitment to the Senate and the United \nStates. In some ways--I didn't plan it this way--it is kind of \nappropriate that he would speak and that I would follow. Senator \nDomenici has served this country in a long and distinguished career. He \nhas been in this Senate for many years. You can tell by his thoughtful \nremarks he cares passionately about his traditions and about the \nresponsibilities we have. I care deeply, too, but I am a new guy. I \njust got here. I didn't hear those speeches he quoted. I have read \nthem, and I have heard a lot of speeches. I come from a little bit of a \ndifferent perspective.\n  For a few minutes, I would like to tell you my opinion on the \nquestion of judicial confirmations and how I arrived at that. For, you \nsee, although I address you as a Senator at this moment, the foundation \nof my beliefs is grounded in the preceding 2 years when I was a \ncandidate for the Senate.\n  Beginning in January of 2002, the 108th Congress convened, and I was \nan announced candidate for this Senate seat. Shortly into that session, \nsomething changed in America--or at least changed here--because the \nholdup of judges for days counted, like Senator Domenici just recited, \nbegan to take place and the filibuster began to be used in a way it had \nnever been used in the United States before.\n  As a candidate for the Senate, I was asked by members of the media, \nconstituents, and Rotary and Kiwanis clubs: Mr. Isakson, if you were \nelected, what do you think the Senate ought to do? My answer was \ninstinctively that I think every judge ought to get an up-or-down vote \nbecause, the way I understand it, that is the responsibility of the \nSenate. But as the intensity of the issue grew and as the campaign \ngained, as campaigns do, and the pressures grew, I did a little \nstudying. I wanted to do my own homework. I didn't have history in the \nSenate, but I did have a Constitution.\n  On some of those long nights on the road between campaign stops, I \nwould read about judicial confirmations, the Constitution, the \nresponsibility of the Senate. For a few moments, I want to share, for \ninformational purposes, with the Members here and those who may be \nwatching or listening exactly what the Constitution says about the \nresponsibility of this body.\n  It is very interesting. If you read the Constitution--I have a few \nunderlined sections here. Everywhere the Constitution requires this \nbody or the House to affirm a position by supermajority vote, it spells \nit out. A few years ago, we dealt with an impeachment issue, and the \nConstitution is clear: it takes a two-thirds vote to convict. We have \ndealt with constitutional amendments on a balanced budget and things of \nthat nature, and the Constitution is quite clear: it takes a two-thirds \nvote. It is even so clear it says it takes a three-fourths vote of the \nStates to ratify the amendment that it takes a two-thirds vote of the \nHouse and Senate to propose.\n  Then let's talk about advice and consent for a second. I want to read \ndirectly from the Constitution the provisions about the \nresponsibilities of this Senate in advice and consent.\n\n       He [referring to the President] shall have the power by and \n     with the advice and consent of the Senate to make treaties \n     provided two-thirds of the Senators present concur.\n\n  That is the first part of a compound sentence. It is saying that it \nis our responsibility to advise and consent on treaties, and it \nspecifically requires two-thirds of us to do so for the treaty to be \nratified.\n  Let me go to the second part of that compound sentence:\n\n       And he [the President] shall nominate and, by and with the \n     advice and consent of the Senate, shall appoint ambassadors, \n     other public ministries and councils, judges of the Supreme \n     Court. . . .\n\n  Et cetera et cetera, with no requirement for a supermajority.\n  When I was running for the Senate and I was continually asked the \nquestion by opponents in the primary and later in the general and by \nthe media: Mr. Isakson, what do you think about this business of judges \nnot getting a vote? And if you are elected, what would you do? I said: \nIt is really kind of simple to me. The Constitution says that it is a \nSenator's responsibility to advise and consent. The Constitution \nspecifies it every place where it requires a supermajority vote. The \nConstitution, in the same sentence that it designates the \nresponsibility for us to ratify treaties by a supermajority, confers \nupon us the responsibility to advise and consent with a majority vote \nof this body.\n  Since I have been elected and since I have been on the Senate floor \nand since I have heard all of the speeches, I have heard all of the \nadjectives assigned to the process we are debating. I will not get into \nany of them because they are more marketing than they are substance. \nBut this document is not marketing; this document is substance. It has \nmade the difference in the United States of America and any other \ncountry that has ever been formed since the creation of this Earth. \nWhile it may not be perfect, it is the best man ever did, and it is \nspecific in what our responsibilities are. In no way does it say \n``maybe,'' ``sometimes,'' or ``whatever.''\n\n  There is one point made from time to time which I would like to \nelaborate on and respond to. There are those who say: Well, but the \nConstitution, when it establishes the House and the Senate, the \nlegislative branch, it says that both shall establish their rules under \nwhich they operate. Therefore, we are just using a rule to prohibit an \nup-or-down vote on the judges. Well, if you carry that argument to the \nlogical extreme, what if we passed a rule that the Senate could pass by \na majority vote the ratification of treaties? Could we contravene the \nConstitution? I think not, because the Constitution is specific. It is \nas specific in our responsibility for two-thirds to ratify treaties as \nit is specific in our responsibility for us to advise and consent on \njudges. I don't believe we could invalidate, through a rule, that \nresponsibility any more than you can extrapolate that because we have a \nrule that includes a filibuster, that it applies to a constitutional \nresponsibility and can invalidate our very requirement. It is just not \nreally logical. That is not Republican or Democrat, it is not a \nmarketing phrase or marketing phrase; it is real simple.\n  When I was sworn into the House of Representatives almost 7 years ago \nnow, I was elected in a special election, and, unusual in the House of \nRepresentatives, when you are elected in a special election, you get to \nmake a speech when you are sworn in.\n  I never worked harder on a speech in all my life because I knew I was \ngoing to be the only guy out of 435 down there, and I had 1 minute to \nsay something intelligent. I struggled with what the right thing to do \nwas.\n  Finally, I went back to my dad, who is not with us anymore, and he \nwent\n\n[[Page S4452]]\n\nback to a quote he used to tell me as a young man. He loved Mark Twain. \nWhen we had one of those difficult decisions to make, he would always \nsay: Son, remember what Mark Twain said. When confronted with a \ndifficult decision, do what's right. You will surprise a few; you will \namaze the rest.\n  A decision that is pretty simple has become very complex for this \nSenate. In the end, we should peel back the arguments and look back to \nthe foundation under which all of us operate, and that is our \nConstitution. The question is simple and our responsibility is clear, \nand every judge nominated by this President, or any President, deserves \nan up-or-down vote one way or another. It is the responsibility of the \nSenate. It is the direction of the Constitution.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/28/senate-section/article/S4452-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4452]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of H.R. 3, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3) to authorize funds for Federal-aid \n     highways, highway safety programs, and transit programs, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Inhofe amendment No. 567, to provide a complete substitute.\n       Bayh amendment No. 568 (to Amendment No. 567), to amend \n     title VII of the Tariff Act of 1930 to provide that the \n     provisions relating to countervailing duties apply to \n     nonmarket economy countries.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, we have several pages of amendments that \nare out there. We repeat our invitation on behalf of myself and Senator \nJeffords. We want to invite all Democrats and Republicans who have \namendments to the highway bill to bring them down. It is going to get \ncrowded later as we go on. Now we have time for adequate consideration, \nfor deliberation, and we encourage Members to bring their amendments to \nthe floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Madam President, I rise in support of the SAFETEA bill. \nEffective transportation is vital to our Nation, and I believe this \nbill will be an important step in helping to meet the country's \ntransportation needs.\n  I would like to thank both Senator Inhofe and Senator Jeffords for \nworking hard on this bill. The people of Oklahoma are blessed with the \nhard work Senator Inhofe has put forward, both in the Senate and when I \nhad the opportunity to serve with him in the House.\n  This bill has required a lot of hard work and a lot of dedication. He \nhas put forward an effort that I think we all appreciate. Sometimes we \nforget to say thank you for the hard work that goes into a bill such as \nthis, including the hard work of the staff, I might add. The staff on \nboth sides has been helpful in putting this legislation together.\n  In particular, I express my support for the public transportation \ntitle of the bill. While many people erroneously refer to this as the \nhighways bill, it is actually a comprehensive reauthorization of the \nNation's surface transportation programs, including transit. A healthy, \nwell-functioning transit network can greatly enhance the effectiveness \nof other transportation modes, and as chairman of the Subcommittee on \nHousing and Transportation of the Banking Committee, I have had many \nopportunities to see the difference reliable public transportation can \nmake for both individuals and communities.\n  I also express my thanks to the Banking Committee chairman, Chairman \nShelby. For many years he has been one of the leading champions for \npublic transportation in the Senate. I appreciate his dedication. It \nhas been a pleasure to work with him as subcommittee chairman on \nreauthorization of the mass transit programs.\n  I also recognize and thank Senator Sarbanes, the ranking member of \nthe Banking Committee, and Senator Reed, the ranking member of the \nHousing and Transportation Subcommittee. They have been actively \ninvolved in the reauthorization process, and I appreciate the \nthoughtful perspective they brought to all of our discussions. Together \nI believe we have been able to accomplish a great deal to improve \npublic transportation in a strong and bipartisan manner.\n  I thank again Senator Inhofe and all the other Republicans on the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee for their hard work and \nleadership. I miss not being on the committee. I was on the committee \nwhen this bill first moved forward. I very much appreciate working with \nmy colleagues.\n  Public transportation is a key component of our Nation's \ntransportation infrastructure and provides safe, reliable, efficient, \nand economic service. Public transportation can create jobs and \nstimulate economic development, as well as reduce traffic congestion \nand pollution.\n  Because I represent the State of Colorado, some people wonder why I \ncare about public transportation. Beyond the national policy concerns, \nthese same people are often surprised when I explain how important \npublic transportation is to my Colorado constituents.\n  Public transportation encompasses a great deal beyond the stereotype \nof subways and heavy rail. People in the Denver suburbs can now take \nlight rail to their jobs downtown. Students in Boulder often use the \nbus system to get around town. Sick people on the eastern plains may \nrely on demand-responsive transit services to go to chemotherapy or \ndialysis appointments. Public transportation is important to many \ndifferent types of people in many different locations. This bill will \nhelp ensure that all these people have access to reliable public \ntransportation.\n  I believe the Senate passed an excellent transportation \nreauthorization bill this last year, and I was especially pleased with \nthe transit title. I believe it made important progress in a number of \nareas while building upon the many successes of TEA-21. Fortunately, we \ncome to the floor with substantially the same package, and I am hopeful \nthis approach will speed things along and allow the bill to move \nforward with a minimal number of amendments.\n  I am very supportive of the formula changes made in the transit \ntitle. These go a long way toward addressing my longstanding concerns \nwith the distribution of transit dollars. As my colleagues may know, \none of my top priorities during the consideration of TEA-21 was to \nbring more equity to the distribution of transit dollars. Senator Rod \nGrams and I were able to make changes that allowed States such as \nColorado to have greater access to this resource.\n  In drafting the reauthorization bill, greater equity has continued to \nbe my top priority. While the traditional transit cities have many \nimportant needs, it is time to update the formulas to include other \nneeds. Today's bill strikes a balance by providing for more traditional \ntransit cities and also providing for new needs by creating several new \nformulas.\n  In particular, I strongly support the new growing States formula. \nHistorically, many of the fastest growing areas in Western and Southern \nStates have had a difficult time obtaining transit dollars. Yet their \nexplosive growth makes transit all the more important. Mass transit can \nhelp growing areas reduce traffic congestion and air pollution, as well \nas increase access to jobs. The new growing States formula will help \ndirect additional resources to the high-growth areas with the greatest \nneed.\n  I also support the new transit-intensive cities formula. This new \nformula will reward smaller cities that are providing greater than \naverage transit service. In addition to providing an incentive for \ncities to improve their transit service, I support the formula because \nit deliberately directs taxpayer dollars to areas that are utilizing \nthem most efficiently.\n\n  Finally, I support the new rural low-density formula. This formula \nwill help rural areas provide critically needed service. Rural areas \nand very small towns generally have older and less affluent citizens, \nthe very people who often rely on public transportation. In\n\n[[Page S4453]]\n\nfact, rural America has an estimated 30 million nondrivers. The problem \nis exacerbated for rural-transit-dependent populations, as compared to \nurban dwellers, because they most often travel great distances, and \nalternate transportation, such as a taxicab, is generally not \navailable. Yet more than 40 percent of residents in rural America have \nno access to public transportation and another 25 percent have \nnegligible access.\n  Because of low-population density and the distances involved, rural \npopulations can be much more difficult and expensive to serve. However, \ntheir need is as real as the need in urban centers. This new formula \nwill begin to help rural States meet those needs.\n  The transit title also places more appropriate emphasis on bus \nprograms. For too long, the mass transit programs have been viewed as \nrail programs. While we can all agree that rail is vitally important to \na select group of cities, the vast majority of Americans rely on bus \nservice. This bill takes a balanced approach, providing resources to \nexpand and improve both bus and rail service.\n  Another way we can help expand the reach of Federal transit dollars \nis through bus rapid transit. As compared to rail, bus rapid transit is \nable to deliver similar capacity for a fraction of the cost. I believe \nwe should find ways to not only allow but to promote the use of bus \nrapid transit. I support the bus rapid transit provisions and believe \nwe should continue to ease the fixed guideway restrictions. In some \nareas, such as Colorado's mountains, geography or other factors make a \nfixed guideway requirement cost prohibitive. We must ensure bus rapid \ntransit has sufficient flexibility to make it a viable option for many \nareas.\n  The Federal Government attempts to strike a balance between \naccountability and easing administrative burdens within its programs. \nHowever, the New Starts Program has gotten out of balance. I believe \nthe Small Starts Program, as proposed in this bill, does strike a \nbetter, more appropriate balance. Under this program, all projects will \nbe subject to the review process rather than exempting projects under \n$25 million. This threshold was causing project distortions and poor \nestimations in an attempt to deem a project under $25 million.\n  In addition to the incentive to underestimate a project, this \napproach lacks accountability for the taxpayer dollars at stake. By \ncontrast, the Small Starts Program in the bill will subject all \nprojects to the review process. However, to ease administrative burden, \nprojects under $75 million will be subject to a streamline process. \nThis will ensure that all projects receive scrutiny and will scale the \nlevel of scrutiny to be appropriate to the project size. This will also \nmake it easier for smaller cities to add transit to their communities \nfor the first time.\n  While public transit agencies are important in providing transit \nservice, the private sector is also a key partner in providing \neffective, efficient service. By making a few modest changes, the \ntransit title ensures they will be able to remain a part of the \nprocess. Public-private partnerships can benefit all parties, and our \nbill will help allow and encourage such partnerships.\n  Another important feature of this bill is its use of incentives \nrather than mandates and penalties. Until now, projects have little \nincentive to use good planning and forecasting or to stay on time and \non budget. By offering incentives, we hope to change that. It is absurd \nthat projects such as TREX in Denver have to return money because they \ndid good planning and stayed on time and under budget. Transit agencies \nshould not be punished for doing a good job. Rather, they should be \nrewarded. I believe they should be able to keep a portion of that money \nfor other transit uses, and the bill before us today will let them do \nthat.\n  Again I thank Banking Committee Chairman Shelby and my colleagues on \nthe committee for their work in producing the transit title of the bill \nthat is before us today. I believe that under the SAFETEA bill, \nAmerica's public transportation system will be able to serve more \npeople more efficiently. I am hopeful the Senate will quickly complete \naction and enact a transportation reauthorization.\n  I reemphasize my sincere thanks to the chairman of the Environment \nand Public Works Committee, Senator Inhofe, for his great work, and the \nother Republicans and members of the committee working with the ranking \nmember, Senator Jeffords. I am pleased this transportation bill, which \nis badly needed, is now moving forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first I say to the Senator from Colorado, \nwe miss him on the committee. He was an excellent member of the \ncommittee. However, he was replaced by some excellent freshmen who are \nas enthusiastic as was the Senator from Colorado. While we miss him on \nthe committee, it is still a great committee, and we certainly \nappreciate very much the comments he made this morning and the \ncontributions he has made to the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, it is my understanding the regular order \nis the amendment offered by the Senator from Indiana. He has agreed to \nset his amendment aside for the consideration of other amendments as \nthey come to the floor, with the understanding he will regain the floor \nafter those amendments are considered and action taken, if action is \ntaken.\n  We do have an amendment from the chairman of the Subcommittee on \nTransportation, Senator Bond, who has worked tirelessly for years on \nthis bill. I am sure he wants to offer it at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be temporarily set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 592\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Bond] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 592.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To strike the highway stormwater discharge mitigation \n                                program)\n\n       Beginning on page 287, strike line 5 and all that follows \n     through the matter following line 25 on page 290.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, this amendment unties the hands of States \nwhich were handcuffed by a provision added in committee last year and \nis still in the bill, a provision on which debate was cut short last \nyear, but now we can finish the job, and I hope we will. This provision \nwill cost the States nearly $900 million in highway, bridge, and \ntransit construction or rehabilitation funding unless we adopt the \namendment.\n  The provision binding our States, section 1620 of the bill, mandates \nthat every State, regardless of whether it needs it or not, set aside 2 \npercent, or nearly $900 million, for use for the life of the bill only \non storm water mitigation activities. My amendment strikes this \nmandatory set-aside.\n  Without the amendment, States will be directed to set aside over $740 \nmillion from their Surface Transportation Program funds, funds that \notherwise could construct or rehabilitate highways, bridges, or transit \nsystems. Without this amendment, States would be forced to set aside \nover $125 million from the Equity Bonus Program set up by this bill to \nhelp States receive more highway dollars. Without this amendment, the \nStates will be forced to use nearly $900 million only on storm water \nmitigation, regardless of the need of such activities.\n  Every State will lose highway dollars under this set-aside. We have \ntables available. Alabama, the set-aside would cost it $19 million; \nAlaska, $10 million; Arizona, $17 million; Arkansas, $12 million. I ask \nMembers to look at how much the Federal Government would dictate how \ntheir highway funds would have to be spent.\n  Every office will receive a list, and we will have copies available. \nI urge every Member to look to see how it affects their State. We are \nfighting extremely hard on the Senate floor to\n\n[[Page S4454]]\n\nprovide States with more transportation funds. This is something the \nchairman and the ranking member, my subcommittee ranking member, \nSenator Baucus, and I have done.\n  We are working with the Finance Committee, Chairman Grassley, and the \nranking member, Senator Baucus, to get the money. I know we will be \ninundated by Members wanting transportation projects in this bill. I \nknow in my new role as chairman of the Transportation Appropriations \nSubcommittee I will be inundated with requests for projects in their \nState, but a Member voting to take funding from highways, bridges, and \ntransit and set it aside for storm water would seem to indicate that \ntheir State has more than enough funding that they can afford to divert \nhighway funds to storm water so the State may not need more highway \nfunds.\n\n  Now, do not get me wrong. I support States having the ability to \naddress their storm water needs if they must do so, and if they choose \nto do so. With my amendment, the States will remain fully authorized to \nuse their highway funds to mitigate storm water problems. Indeed, this \nbill preserves and actually expands the ability of States to spend \nhighway dollars on storm water mitigation, on a highway project if that \nis what is needed in their State.\n  Current law allows States to spend up to 20 percent of a project's \ncost using STP funds on storm water mitigation. That is unchanged. The \nbill also expands storm water eligibility by allowing States to spend \nup to 20 percent of a project's cost under the National Highway System \nfunds on storm water mitigation. That is unchanged by this amendment.\n  I seek only to strike the mandatory set-aside; the Federal Government \nbig daddy knows better than the States how to spend their funds to \nassure adequate transportation and protection of the environment.\n  There is no one in this body who has fought longer and harder than I \nhave, my former colleague, my ranking member, Senator Mikulski, for \nFederal funding for water quality and drinking water. When we served as \nhead of the Senate appropriations subcommittee that funded EPA, we \nrestored hundreds of millions of dollars in proposed cuts to the clean \nwater and safe drinking water funds. Every year we appropriated \nmillions of dollars to protect, sustain, and restore the health of our \nNation's water habitats and ecosystems. We spent millions funding water \nprojects for the Chesapeake Bay, the Gulf of Mexico, Lake Champlain, \nLong Island Sound, and the Great Lakes. Last year, we sent hundreds of \nmillions of dollars more to Members' States for targeted investments \nand water infrastructure. We do that every year for our colleagues \nbecause we believe so much in providing clean and safe drinking water \nfor our families and local communities.\n  Forcing another arbitrary mandate on States, taking precious highway \nand transit construction dollars and diverting them for another purpose \ndoes not make sense. Decisions should be made by each State on a case-\nby-case, project-by-project basis, not as a result of another one-size-\nfits-all Federal mandate sent down from Washington.\n  Let me repeat, this amendment strikes only the set-aside mandate and \nleaves fully intact storm water funding eligibility. I urge my \ncolleagues to let States keep $900 million for highway bridge and \ntransit construction and to turn back this new Federal mandate on \nStates. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letters in support of this amendment \nfrom the American Association of State Highway and Transportation \nOfficials; the Transportation Construction Coalition, a coalition of \nbuilders and union representatives; the Associated General Contractors \nof America; the American Road and Transportation Builders Association; \nand a list of other organizations and unions supporting this amendment \nbe printed in the Record after my remarks.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Organizations Supporting the Bond Amendment To Strike the Stormwater \n                               Set-Aside\n\n       American Association of State Highway and Transportation \n     Officials Associated General Contractors of America; American \n     Road & Transportation Builders Association; American Coal Ash \n     Association; American Concrete Pavement Association; American \n     Concrete Pipe Association; American Council of Engineering \n     Companies; American Society of Civil Engineers; American \n     Subcontractors Association; American Traffic Safety Services \n     Association; Asphalt Emulsion Manufacturers Association; \n     Asphalt Recycling & Reclaiming Association; Associated \n     Equipment Distributors; Association of Equipment \n     Manufacturers; International Slurry Surfacing Association; \n     International Association of Bridge, Structural, Ornamental \n     and Reinforcing Iron Workers; International Union of \n     Operating Engineers; Laborers-International Union of North \n     America, AFL-CIO; National Asphalt Pavement Association; \n     National Association of Surety Bond Producers; National Lime \n     Association; National Ready Mixed Concrete Association; \n     National Stone, Sand and Gravel Association; National Utility \n     Contractors Association; Portland Cement Association; \n     Precast/Prestressed Concrete Institute; The Road Information \n     Program; and United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of \n     America.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   April 27, 2005.\n     Hon. Christopher S. Bond,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bond: The transportation construction \n     industry, working in partnership with federal, state and \n     local government, recognizes its special responsibility to \n     provide transportation improvements in a manner least \n     disruptive possible to the natural environment. And our \n     members are justifiably proud that they are actually able to \n     provide environmental enhancements in the course of many \n     projects they construct.\n       It is for these reasons that we support the provisions in \n     the Senate Environment & Public Works Committee's proposed \n     highway/transit program reauthorization bill, H.R. 3, that \n     will give state transportation departments more flexibility \n     in how--and how much--they fund transportation-related storm \n     water mitigation activities.\n       What we do not support is a provision included in H.R. 3 \n     that would force all states to spend at least two percent of \n     their federal Surface Transportation Program (STP) funds on \n     storm water mitigation. This misguided, if well-intentioned \n     amendment, if left to stand, will divert nearly $900 million \n     from highway construction projects nationwide over the life \n     of the bill.\n       As mentioned, H.R. 3 takes a number of positive actions to \n     advance and expand state expenditures on storm water \n     mitigation--but it does so by leaving the decision making and \n     choices to the state agencies that know best how much funding \n     is necessary for this activity--in their state. For example, \n     H.R. 3 will allow all states to not only use their STP funds \n     for storm water mitigation, but also, for the first time, \n     their National Highway System Program (NHS) funds as well--if \n     they choose to do so.\n       H.R. 3 also, for the first time, would give states the \n     option to use their federal funds for storm water mitigation \n     activities on all federally-aided highway projects, not just \n     those, as under current law, that are defined as \n     ``reconstruction, rehabilitation, resurfacing, or \n     restoration.''\n       The ``add on'' two percent mandatory STP set-aside included \n     in H.R. 3 clearly is a federal ``command-and-control'' \n     mechanism that is not necessary.\n       The American Road and Transportation Builders Association \n     strongly supports your amendment to eliminate the proposed \n     two percent storm water mitigation set-aside provision from \n     H.R. 3. We urge all senators to join you in this important \n     effort.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   T. Peter Ruane,\n     President & CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   April 27, 2005.\n     Hon. Daniel Akaka,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Akaka: On behalf of the Associated General \n     Contractors of America (AGC), I am writing to urge you to \n     support a Bond amendment to H.R. 3, which would prevent \n     states from losing nearly $900 million in critical highway \n     and transit funding over the next five years. Specifically, \n     the amendment proposes to strike a provision that mandates \n     states to set aside 2 percent of their highway formula \n     funding to be used only on stormwater mitigation activities.\n       Under current law, states can already choose to use their \n     Surface Transportation Program (STP) funds--up to 20 percent \n     of a project's cost--on stormwater mitigation activities. \n     H.R. 3 already expands that funding eligibility to National \n     Highway System (NHS) Program funds. The Bond amendment would \n     not change this eligibility.\n       All states have unique needs that far exceed available \n     resources. By striking the mandatory 2 percent set-aside for \n     stormwater mitigation, the Bond amendment simply gives states \n     maximum flexibility to use their federal highway funds as \n     they see fit.\n       I have attached a table to this letter that shows the \n     amount of funding your state would be forced to set aside \n     from your highway and transit funding for stormwater \n     mitigation if the Bond amendment is not adopted. The amount \n     on the chart is funding that your state would not be able to \n     use to maintain or improve the condition of its highways, \n     bridges, or transit systems. Nationwide, the Bond amendment \n     would give states an additional $900 million over the next \n     five years.\n\n[[Page S4455]]\n\n       States should be able to make their own decisions on how \n     best to use their limited federal transportation dollars. \n     Please oppose this arbitrary federal mandate by supporting \n     the Bond amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             Jeffrey D. Shoaf,\n\n                                        Senior Executive Director,\n     Government and Public Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   April 27, 2005.\n       Dear Senator: During the Senate debate on the \n     Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users, H.R. 3, you \n     will have an opportunity to reject a new, top-down effort for \n     federal management of state highway programs that would force \n     highway funds to be diverted to non-transportation purposes. \n     We urge you to support an amendment by Senate Transportation \n     and Infrastructure Subcommittee Chairman Christopher Bond (R-\n     Mo.) to eliminate a new program that would require a portion \n     of federal highway formula funds to be used for storm water \n     mitigation projects.\n       H.R. 3 includes a provision that would require states to \n     use two percent of their federal Surface Transportation \n     Program (STP) funds for storm water mitigation activities. \n     Over the measure's life, this provision would result in \n     nearly $900 million in highway formula funds that would not \n     be available for highway, highway safety and bridge \n     improvement activities.\n       This proposal contradicts the flexibility provided \n     throughout the federal highway program and H.R. 3 that allows \n     states the ability to meet their own unique transportation \n     challenges. Storm water mitigation activities are currently \n     eligible for STP funds--a choice left up to states, not \n     mandated by federal law. In fact, H.R. 3 includes separate \n     provisions that would broaden the eligibility for states to \n     spend not only STP, but also National Highway System program \n     funds on storm water projects.\n       H.R. 3 would also extend eligibility for federal funds to \n     be used on storm water mitigation related to federal highway \n     projects, not just those projects undergoing reconstruction, \n     rehabilitation, resurfacing or restoration--as is the current \n     law. Consequently, the proposed creation of a mandatory storm \n     water mitigation ``set-aside'' is unnecessary and undermines \n     the ability of states to make their own decisions about the \n     best use of federal highway formula funds.\n       The nation has vast unmet surface transportation and water \n     infrastructure needs. Depriving states the ability to address \n     their highway and highway safety needs in order to fund storm \n     water mitigation projects is a false choice. It is far more \n     appropriate to complement state's current flexibility with \n     the enactment of a comprehensive water infrastructure bill. \n     Consequently, we urge you to support the Bond amendment to \n     strike the storm water mitigation program from H.R. 3.\n       Thank you for your consideration of these views.\n           Sincerely,\n     The Transportation Construction Coalition.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   April 27, 2005.\n     Hon. Christopher Bond,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bond: The American Association of State \n     Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) represents the \n     State transportation agencies in the fifty States, the \n     District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. On behalf of our member \n     States, we support your Amendment to strike Section 1620 of \n     SAFETEA, which would mandate that the States set-aside 2% of \n     their Surface Transportation Program (STP) funds and of the \n     STP portion of the Equity Bonus Program. This set-aside would \n     divert $867 million from the core program that provides \n     funding for highway and bridge construction, rehabilitation \n     and repair.\n       Even if Section 1620 is removed, as you propose, any State \n     could continue to spend up to 20% of a project's cost on \n     storm water activities--but at the discretion of the State. \n     Section 1620 would mandate that each and every State spend a \n     specified amount of highway funds for construction of storm \n     water facilities regardless of a State's funding priorities \n     and needs with respect to transportation and water issues. \n     Moreover, these funds would be set aside for storm water \n     projects not necessarily associated with a particular highway \n     project.\n       The storm water set-aside would merely divert scarce funds \n     from the federal highway and transit program. It is through \n     the core highway programs, including the STP program, that \n     States and local governments build, maintain and operate a \n     safe and efficient highway system. Erosion of the core \n     programs through set-asides such as storm water diminishes \n     the ability of state and local governments to respond to \n     their needs.\n       We support your amendment to strike Section 1620 of SAFETEA \n     and appreciate your leadership on this issue.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                     John Horsley,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Bond \namendment to strike section 1620 of the underlying bill, the highway \nstormwater discharge mitigation program.\n  This section provides much-needed assistance to our States and local \ncommunities to deal with the impacts of highway stormwater discharges.\n  Without these funds, our Nation's highways are at risk of becoming a \nconduit for pollutants to reach fragile waterways and ecosystems.\n  In the last Congress, the Senate recognized the need for this program \nand adopted this provision as part of the transportation bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to continue their support for this vital \nprogram.\n  Our Nation is facing a water quality challenge.\n  Since the enactment of the Clean Water Act in 1970, we have taken \nsteps to reduce pollution coming from point sources such as wastewater \ntreatment plants and industry.\n  However, according to the EPA's most recent National Water Quality \nInventory, 40 percent of our Nation's waterways are still impaired.\n  Non-point source pollution is the next hurdle for this Nation to \novercome if we are to truly make progress and improve our water \nquality.\n  EPA states that urban run-off and storm sewers are the number four \nsource of pollution in rivers, number three in lakes, and number two in \nestuaries.\n  When it rains or when snow melts, roads serve as conduits for \npollutants such as oil and grease, heavy metals, and sediment that flow \ndirectly into rivers, streams, and lakes.\n  Because roads prevent rainfall and snowmelt from soaking into the \nground, the physical characteristics of surrounding water bodies are \nalso altered.\n  Groundwater recharge is reduced, affecting water supplies.\n  Stream channels erode due to rapid, heavy flows, leading to excessive \nsituation in rivers and streams which severely impacts fish habitat. \nThis is a major part of our stormwater problem in Vermont.\n  Water temperatures are altered, impacting wildlife.\n  In addition, flooding can occur which not only damages the \nenvironment but also puts human lives and property at risk.\n  The highway stormwater discharge mitigation program will ensure that \ncommunities have at least a portion of the resources to solve their \nwater quality problems stemming from Federal-aid highways.\n  It authorizes 2 percent of surface transportation program funds to be \nused for highway stormwater discharge mitigation.\n  This would provide a total of $867 million over 5 years.\n  The program would reduce the impacts to watersheds from the \ndevelopment of highways and roads while addressing the goals in the \nFederal Clean Water Act by funding projects that improve water quality.\n  The new program emphasizes non-structural solutions to managing \nstormwater runoff, which reduce costs to local communities, protect the \nnatural water cycle, and provide more overall environmental benefits.\n  In my home State of Vermont, Lake Champlain, which also borders the \nState of New York, is threatened by pollution from storm water run off.\n  Although it is one of the cleanest large lakes in the United States, \nLake Champlain is polluted with nutrients and sediment.\n  The fastest growing source of pollution reaching the lake is runoff \nfrom developed land, including highways.\n  Roadway drainage systems carry sediment and nutrients, and the cost \nof cleaning up existing roadway runoff to Lake Champlain is estimated \nat more than $500,000 each year for the next 9 years.\n  Similar problems exist in the Connecticut River basin in Vermont.\n  Currently, our State is struggling to deal with a backlog of expired \nstorm water permits, extremely limited resources, and statewide storm \nwater discharge water quality issues that threaten the growth of our \neconomy by stalling development.\n  The two most important road improvement projects in our biggest city \nhave been repeatedly delayed by storm water pollution concerns, slowing \nthe construction schedules by months and even years.\n  One of our greatest assets in my home State of Vermont is our \npristine environment, including Lake Champlain.\n  We need to ensure that as we improve our roadway network to meet the \ndemands of a growing population we do\n\n[[Page S4456]]\n\nnot sacrifice the quality of our environment that draws people to visit \nand move to Vermont in the first place.\n  I have heard some of my colleagues from more arid States question the \nneed for these funds given climatic differences.\n  However, each and every State in the Nation has critical storm water \nmitigation needs.\n  Under new regulations that took effect in March 2003, over 50,000 \nsmall communities, counties, and other areas in every State must now \nmanage stormwater runoff to meet Clean Water Act requirements.\n  The EPA estimated the cost to comply with these regulations to be \nabout $1 billion per year.\n  Larger cities already manage stormwater pollution in order to meet \ndischarge permits and other Clean Water Act requirements.\n  Every State in the country has at least one community covered by \nthese regulations.\n  The arid and semi-arid western United States has receiving waters \nthat are generally smaller than their eastern counterparts.\n  Therefore, the impacts of urban stormwater are more strongly felt in \nwestern waterways.\n  For example, in the State of Nevada, the Las Vegas Valley Stormwater \nManagement Committee found in its 2003 annual report that zinc and lead \nconcentrations were 10 to 96 times higher in stormwater runoff than in \nother parts of the Nation, an effect attributed to the fewer number of \nstorms in the arid Southwest.\n  EPA estimates that Arizona communities will need about $150 million \nto meet stormwater regulatory requirements, plus an additional $40 \nmillion in estimated costs to address urban runoff. Arizona's portion \nof stormwater funding under section 1620 of the highway bill is about \n$17 million.\n  The California Department of Transportation estimates that the cost \nof stormwater controls on existing highways would range from between $4 \nmillion and $7.5 million per mile of highway.\n  The Chesapeake Bay Commission estimated in January of 2003 that \nstormwater retrofit costs across the watershed are more than $9 \nbillion.\n  In demonstration of the nationwide support for this stormwater \nprovision in the highway bill, I ask unanimous consent that multiple \nletters opposing the Bond amendment and endorsing the underlying \nprovision be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                             The United States\n\n                                         Conference of Mayors,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, Apr. 25, 2005.\n     Hon. James M. Inhofe,\n     Chair, Environment & Public Works, U.S. Senate, Dirksen \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. James M. Jeffords,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Environment & Public Works \n         Committee, U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Inhofe and Ranking Minority Member Jeffords: \n     On behalf of The United States Conference of Mayors and the \n     hundreds of cities we represent, I write to convey our strong \n     support for the stormwater provisions of your Committee-\n     approved SAFETEA plan to renew the nation's surface \n     transportation programs.\n       These provisions, reserving less than \\1/3\\ of a penny on \n     every authorized dollar, is a very modest commitment to an \n     enormous challenge before local governments struggling with \n     contamination of drinking water and cleanup of streams, \n     rivers, lakes and ponds from highway and street stormwater \n     discharge, including oil, grease, lead and mercury. Moreover, \n     we have been assured that these provisions limit funding to \n     actual facilities on the federal aid system, which is a \n     critical factor underlying our support of this program. This \n     is important to the nation's cities since it ensures that \n     users of these systems contribute something to the broader \n     efforts under the Clean Water Act to reduce pollutants from \n     the nation's major highways and roads.\n       Absent some commitment to retrofitting existing facilities \n     on the federal aid system during this renewal period, \n     stormwater pollution cleanup costs, including loadings \n     attributable to the federal aid system, will be borne largely \n     by local taxpayers through property taxes, other general \n     taxes and wastewater utility user fees.\n       Finally, we disagree with the claim that this is a \n     diversion of funds from highway construction and highway \n     capacity needs. It is the belief of the nation's mayors that \n     improved performance, whether it is pavement quality, the \n     development of technology, or its stormwater quality \n     features, are priorities for the nation as we work with you \n     to provide a modern and fully functional transportation \n     system for our citizens and their communities and regions.\n       America's mayors thank you for making these provisions part \n     of your SAFETEA legislation and urge you to preserve this \n     important commitment to stormwater pollution abatement \n     efforts during your conference committee deliberations with \n     the House. If you have any questions, please contact our \n     Assistant Executive Director for Transportation Policy Ron \n     Thaniel at (202) 861-6711 or e-mail at rthaniel@usmayors.org.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Tom Cochran,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n         Association of State and Interstate Water Pollution \n           Control Administrators,\n                                   Washington, DC, April 22, 2005.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the Association of State and \n     Interstate Water Pollution Control Administrators (ASIWPCA), \n     I urge your support for the Highway Stormwater Discharge \n     Mitigation Program, Section 1620 of the Senate SAFETEA bill, \n     S. 1072, in the 108th Congress. This new and modest program \n     is designed to address stormwater runoff from the nation's \n     existing transportation system. Stormwater runoff is a \n     significant source of water pollution affecting large and \n     small communities, as well as fish, wildlife and the natural \n     environment.\n       Stormwater pollution results from paving over naturally \n     porous ground, resulting in impervious surfaces that collect \n     pollutants and increase overland stormwater volume and \n     velocity. Stormwater becomes a direct conduit for pollution \n     into the nation's rivers, lakes, and coastal waters. Studies \n     have shown that roads contribute a large number of pollutants \n     to urban runoff--metals, used motor oil, grease, coolants and \n     antifreeze, spilled gasoline, nutrients from vehicle exhaust, \n     and sediment. For example, the stormwater discharge from one \n     square mile of roads and parking lots can contribute about \n     20,000 gallons of residual oil per year into the nation's \n     drinking water supplies. Highways can increase the annual \n     volume of stormwater discharges by up to 16 times the pre-\n     development rate and reduce groundwater recharge.\n       Communities throughout the nation, including many smaller \n     towns and counties, are required under the Clean Water Act to \n     obtain discharge (NPDES) permits for their stormwater. Those \n     communities, which have long understood the value of \n     protecting their drinking water sources and recreational \n     waters from stormwater impacts, are hard-pressed to absorb \n     the costs of discharges from highways in addition to their \n     other stormwater management responsibilities. This presents \n     an unfair burden to these communities and we believe it is \n     fair for the transportation funding system to help remedy \n     this problem where existing highways and other roads cause \n     significant runoff problems.\n       We urge you to continue to demonstrate your leadership in \n     protecting America's waters by supporting the stormwater \n     mitigation provision in SAFETEA. We appreciate your \n     willingness to consider the views of the State and Interstate \n     Water Pollution Program officials responsible for the \n     protection and enhancement of the nation's water quality \n     resources.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Arthur G.

James Inhofe,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Inhofe: On behalf of the environmental Council \n     of the States (ECOS*), I'm writing to request your support \n     for the Highway Stormwater Discharge Mitigation Program, the \n     new provision included in S. 732, the Safe, Accountable, \n     Flexible, and Efficient Transportation Act of 2005 (SAFETEA), \n     section 1620.\n       EOS strongly supports the provision because stormwater \n     compliance is a serious issues for the states and this \n     provision provides for $867 million over five years, \n     specifically for stormwater mitigation projects associated \n     with the nation's federal-aid highways. The provision would \n     provide states with much needed resources to help meet \n     stormwater and water quality requirements of the Clean Water \n     Act. These funds are particularly critical during this time \n     of budgetary constraints.\n       Please feel free to contact me if you would like to discuss \n     this matter further. I may be reached at 202-624-3600.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  R. Steven Brown,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n[[Page S4457]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                 Water Environment Federation,\n\n                                 Alexandria, VA, February 7, 2005.\n     Hon. James Jeffords,\n     Ranking Member Environment and Public Works Committee, U.S. \n         Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Jeffords: The Water Environment Federation \n     (WEF) urges you to support a dedicated funding program to \n     mitigate the negative impacts of stormwater runoff from our \n     nation's highways. The Highway Stormwater Discharge \n     Mitigation Program was included in the Senate Safe, \n     Accountable, Flexible, and Efficient Transportation Equity \n     Act of 2003 (SAFETEA) bill, S. 1072, in the 108th Congress. \n     It is critical that this program be included in this year's \n     version of the transportation bill.\n       According to U.S. EPA, contaminated stormwater is the \n     largest contributor to the impairment of water quality in \n     U.S. coastal waters and the second largest source of \n     impairment in estuaries. Contaminated stormwater is also the \n     single largest factor in beach closures and advisories. The \n     cost to address these problems is large, too. The U.S. EPA \n     estimates at least $8.3 billion over 20 years in local \n     funding needs to address Clean Water Act stormwater \n     requirements, and an additional $142 billion to address \n     stormwater infiltration and other problems in separate and \n     combined sewer systems.\n       Congress has recognized that contaminated runoff from \n     highways is a significant source of water quality impairment \n     in previous highway bills (ISTEA and TEA-21), but has not \n     succeeded in getting adequate funding directed toward this \n     problem. A dedicated fund to address stormwater impacts from \n     existing federal aid highways will help to prevent further \n     degradation of streams, lakes, and beach waters. This funding \n     will benefit all Americans by helping communities comply with \n     Clean Water Act stormwater requirements and to clean up \n     waters impaired by highway runoff.\n       On behalf of the members of the Water Environment \n     Federation, who are professionals working to protect water \n     quality around the world, thank you for your support of this \n     important provision that will help to improve the nation's \n     water resources.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Tim Williams,\n     Managing Director, Government Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n                                       Association of Metropolitan\n\n\n                                            Sewerage Agencies,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 22, 2005.\n     Re Support for S. 721 and the Highway Stormwater Discharge \n         Mitigation Program.\n\n     Hon. James M. Inhofe,\n     Chair, Environment and Public Works Committee, Dirksen Senate \n         Office Building, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. James M. Jeffords,\n     Ranking Member, Environment and Public Works Committee, \n         Dirksen Senate Office Building, U.S. Senate, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Chairman Inhofe and Senator Jeffords: We are writing \n     to express our strong support for the Safe, Accountable, \n     Flexible and Efficient Transportation Equity Act of 2005 \n     (SAFETEA) (S. 732) as passed March 16 by the Senate \n     Environment and Public Works Committee. The Committee's bill \n     includes a provision to authorize $867.6 million over five \n     years for stormwater mitigation projects, using just 2% of \n     the Surface Transportation Program funds. Such projects \n     include stormwater retrofits, the recharge of groundwater, \n     natural filters, stream restoration, minimization of stream \n     bank erosion, innovative technologies, and others.\n       According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, \n     polluted stormwater from impervious surfaces such as roads is \n     a leading cause of impairment for nearly 40% of U.S. \n     waterways not meeting water quality standards. Roadways \n     produce some of the highest concentrations of pollutants such \n     as phosphorus, suspended solids, bacteria, and heavy metals.\n       AMSA represents hundreds of publicly owned treatment works, \n     many of which have municipal stormwater management \n     responsibilities. Your continued support for S. 732, \n     including the Highway Stormwater Discharge Mitigation \n     Program, would provide much-needed support to these \n     communities. Thank you for your leadership and please feel \n     free to contact me at 202/833-4653 if AMSA can provide you \n     with additional information.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                         Ken Kirk,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                       Association of Metropolitan\n\n\n                                               Water Agencies,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 22, 2005.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the nation's largest publicly \n     owned drinking water systems, I write today to express \n     support for section 1620 of the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, \n     and Efficient Transportation Equity Act of 2005 (S. 732), \n     which would provide $870 million over five years for \n     stormwater mitigation projects.\n       This language makes progress toward addressing the billions \n     of dollars in costs that state and local governments will \n     incur to control stormwater generated by our nation's \n     highways.\n       Stormwater runoff has a significant effect on thousands of \n     miles of the nation's rivers and streams. The bill \n     acknowledges this impact and assists states and local \n     communities in addressing this growing water quality problem.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Diane VanDe Hei,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                   Association of State Floodplain\n\n\n                                                Managers, Inc.\n\n                               Madison, Wisconsin, April 25, 2005.\n     Hon. James M. Inhofe,\n     Chairman, Environment & Public Works Committee, Dirksen \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman and Senator Jeffords: The Association of \n     State Floodplain Managers (ASFPM) is very supportive of a \n     provision in the Senate Safe, Accountable, Flexible and \n     Efficient Transportation Equity Act (S. 732) which provides \n     for a Highway Stormwater Discharge Mitigation Program.\n       The membership of the Association of State Floodplain \n     Managers includes state and local officials all over the \n     country who work with FEMA and other federal agencies to \n     reduce loss of life and property due to flooding. Our \n     membership of almost 7,000 also includes many other \n     professionals in the field.\n       We are extremely pleased that the Senate Environment and \n     Public Works Committee has recognized the alterations that \n     often occur in floodplains due to construction and \n     modification of highways and roads as well as the effects of \n     runoff pollutants on waterways, lakes, and wetlands. A \n     commitment of 2% of the Surface Transportation Program funds \n     to assist local officials in mitigating the effects of \n     stormwater runoff will be a wise and important element of \n     highway planning and construction. The funds can also be used \n     for retrofit of already built highways to mitigate existing \n     inadvertent adverse impacts.\n       ASFPM has developed a conceptual framework for alleviating \n     such inadvertent effects on flood risk. The ``No Adverse \n     Impact'' or ``NAI'' concept seeks to guide state and local \n     decision makers in evaluating the effects of development and \n     the creation of impervious surfaces. The No Adverse Impact \n     approach focuses on planning for and lessening flood impacts \n     resulting from land use changes. It is essentially a ``do no \n     harm'' policy that will significantly decrease the creation \n     of new flood damages. Further information on the concept can \n     be found at our website: www.floods.org.\n       Providing for mitigation of stormwater runoff effects would \n     significantly contribute to implementation of a No Adverse \n     Impact approach to flood loss reduction in our nation. As the \n     full Senate will soon consider S. 732, we would like you to \n     be aware of our very strong support for the stormwater runoff \n     mitigation provision. ASFPM is grateful for your commitment \n     to this provision and urges your continued commitment.\n           Very sincerely,\n                                                   Chad Berginnis,\n     ASFPM Chair.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                              Trout Unlimited,\n\n                                                   March 15, 2005.\n     Re Support of Highway Stormwater Discharge Mitigation Funding \n         in the Transportation Bill.\n\n     Hon. Jim Inhofe,\n     Chairman, Environment and Public Works Committee, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Inhofe: Trout Unlimited, the nation's leading \n     trout and salmon conservation organization, urges you to \n     support funding to mitigate stormwater runoff in this year's \n     transportation bill. A similar provision, Section 1620, the \n     Highway Stormwater Discharge Mitigation Program, was included \n     in last year's Senate transportation bill, S. 1072.\n       Stormwater runoff is a significant source of pollution for \n     all the nation's waters, and is a major cause of trout and \n     salmon habitat loss. Roads are a major source of stormwater \n     runoff. Road building in the United States has created \n     millions of miles of impervious surfaces that collect water \n     and pollutants. When mixed with rain and melting snow, these \n     pollutants flow unimpeded into nearby streams, undermining \n     water quality and warming water temperatures to the point \n     where trout habitat is damaged. Furthermore, excessive and \n     poorly designed road building through watersheds can turn \n     normal rainstorms into small flash floods that scour stream \n     bottoms and de-stabilize stream banks, leading to poorer \n     quality streams over time.\n       Congress has recognized that runoff pollution from highways \n     lowers water quality and destroys habitat in receiving waters \n     in previous highway bills (ISTEA and TEA-21), but has not yet \n     succeeded in getting adequate funding directed at curbing \n     this pollution. In 2000, EPA estimated at least $8.3 billion \n     over 20 years in local funding needs to address stormwater \n     requirements. The time to take action is now as you consider \n     the new Highway Bill.\n       In addition to providing much-needed funding, the bill \n     encourages projects with the least impact on streams and \n     promotes the use of non-structural techniques, such as \n     created wetlands, to mitigate the negative impacts of \n     stormwater. These approaches are generally more cost-\n     effective and do more to protect and improve water quality \n     and protect habitat.\n       Thank you for your support of this important provision in \n     this year's transportation bill.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Steve Moyer,\n       Vice President, Government Affairs and Volunteer \n     Operations.\n\n[[Page S4458]]\n\n                                                 February 10, 2005\n     Re Highway Stormwater Discharge Mitigation Funding in the \n         Transportation Bill.\n\n       Dear Senator: The undersigned organization dedicated to \n     protecting America's waters urge you to support funding to \n     mitigate stormwater runoff in this year's transportation \n     bill. A similar provision, Section 1620, the Highway \n     Stormwater Discharge Mitigation Program, was included in last \n     year's Senate transportation bill, S. 1072.\n       Stormwater runoff is a significant source of pollution for \n     all the nation's waters, and roads are a major source of \n     stormwater runoff. When rain falls on a natural landscape, \n     the water is absorbed by plants and soil where it is filtered \n     and released slowly into nearby streams and rivers and \n     replenishes ground water supplies. Road building in the \n     United States has created millions of miles of impervious \n     surfaces that collect water and pollutants, including oil, \n     grease, lead and other heavy metals. When mixed with rain and \n     melting snow, these pollutants flow unimpeded into nearby \n     streams, ditches, rivers and ponds. Excessive and poorly \n     designed road building through watersheds can turn normal \n     rainstorms into small flash floods that damage natural \n     systems and are very costly to local communities. Stormwater \n     runoff also pours into sewers causing overflows of untreated \n     sewage into drinking water supplies and recreational waters.\n       Congress has recognized that runoff pollution from highways \n     contaminates downstream waters in previous highway bills \n     (ISTEA and TEA-21), but has not yet succeeded in getting \n     adequate funding directed at curbing this pollution. Under \n     the Clean Water Act, thousands of local communities must \n     obtain permits for their stormwater discharges and develop \n     programs to mitigate runoff.\n       In 2000, U.S. EPA estimated at least $8.3 billion over 20 \n     years in local funding needs to address stormwater \n     requirements, and an additional $92 billion and $50.3 billion \n     to address stormwater infiltration and other problems in \n     separate and combined sewer . . .\n       Environmental Integrity Project--Michele Merkel, \n     Washington, DC; National Audubon Society--Kasey Gillette, \n     Washington, DC; Natural Resources Defense Council--Nancy \n     Stoner, Washington, DC; The Ocean Conservancy--Catherine \n     Hazlewood, Washington, DC; Sierra Club--Ed Hopkins, \n     Washington, DC; Smart Growth America--Don Chen, Washington, \n     DC; Surface Transportation Policy Project--Ann Canby, \n     Washington, DC; Trust for Public Land--Alan Front, \n     Washington, DC; U.S. Public Interest Research Group--Christy \n     Leavitt, Washington, DC; Delaware Nature Society--Eileen \n     Butler, Hockessin, DE.\n       Control Growth Now, Inc.--Dan Lobeck, Sarasota, FL; Keep \n     Manatee Beautiful--Ingrid McClellan, Bradenton, FL; Reef \n     Relief--Paul G.

The Bond amendment is opposed by the: U.S. Conference \nof Mayors, State Water Pollution Control Administrators, Environmental \nCouncil of States, Trout, Unlimited, Metropolitan Sewerage Agencies, \nMetropolitan Water Agencies, American River, and a host of other \norganizations.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the League of Conservation \nVoters indicating its opposition to the Bond amendment and its intent \nto score this vote be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                League of Conservation Voters,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 26, 2005.\n     Re: S. 732 Safe, Accountable, Flexible, and Efficient \n         Transportation Equity Act of 2005 (SAFETEA). Remove \n         provisions that weaken the Clean Air Act and National \n         Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Oppose the Bond (D-MO) \n         motion to strike stormwater mitigation funds.\n\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: The League of Conservation Voters (LCV) is \n     the political voice of the national environmental community. \n     Each year, LCV publishes the National Environmental \n     Scorecard, which details the voting records of Members of \n     Congress on environmental legislation. The Scorecard is \n     distributed to LCV members, concerned voters nationwide, and \n     the press.\n       LCV urges Congress to pass a balanced transportation bill \n     that protects public health and the environment as it \n     encourages the development of transportation options. \n     SAFETEA, as drafted, will mean increased air pollution from \n     cars and trucks and weakened environmental review of \n     projects.\n       To keep growth in traffic from undermining regional air \n     pollution control strategies, the Clean Air Act requires that \n     regional transportation plans contribute to the timely \n     attainment of health-based air standards. S. 732 would weaken \n     these requirements, by constraining the analysis of \n     transportation impacts to 10 years, rather than the 20-year \n     planning horizon now used. As a result, the actual impacts of \n     new projects would not be considered, resulting in long-term \n     increases in air pollution, traffic and sprawl, and increased \n     public health impacts.\n       Signed into law in 1970 by the Nixon administration, NEPA \n     requires the federal government to examine the potential \n     environmental impact of federally funded activities and share \n     its findings with the public. Under NEPA, the Department of \n     Transportation is afforded the opportunity to fix problems \n     with environmental compliance and review before decisions are \n     finalized. The government's own findings demonstrate that \n     environmental reviews are not a significant cause of delays. \n     If, however, this bill includes new, rigid deadlines and \n     review procedures, federal agencies would be forced to cut \n     corners. This could lengthen the process down the line by \n     spurring legal challenges and forcing agencies to make time-\n     consuming revisions.\n       In addition, LCV urges you to oppose the Bond (R-MO) motion \n     to strike the Highway Stormwater Discharge Mitigation \n     Program, Section 1620. This motion would eliminate a critical \n     program, which would provide up to $867.6 million (only two \n     percent of Surface Transportation Program funds) to mitigate \n     the effects of stormwater runoff from roads and highways. \n     This is especially important since nearly half of the \n     pollution in our waterways is due to runoff from roads and \n     parking lots.\n       LCV's Political Advisory Committee will consider including \n     votes on these issues in compiling LCV's 2004 Scorecard. If \n     you need more information, please call Tiernan Sittenfeld or \n     Barbara Elkus in my office at (202) 785-8683.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Deb Callahan.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. One of our Nation's most precious resources is our \nwater. Water quality affects the environment, wildlife, our health, and \nour economy.\n  Section 1620 of the transportation bill recognizes the significant \ncontribution that roads make to stormwater pollution, and it provides \ncritical funding to help States and local communities mitigate these \ndamages.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the Bond amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished managers of this \nbill. I had been discussing with Senator Bond options with regard to \nthis amendment. Those discussions as yet have not yielded any course of \naction. I judge that he took the initiative here; I just was unaware he \nhad taken it.\n  At this time I am chairing a hearing in the Armed Services Committee \non military intelligence. We have finished our open session. We are now \nproceeding to S. 407 to conclude our hearing with a closed session. I \nam not able at this juncture to address this important amendment from \nthe perspective of the Senator from Virginia who is the sponsor of the \namendment in the committee, which was adopted as part of the markup. So \nI thank the distinguished chairman. My understanding is he did address \nthe Senate with regard to my unavailability at this time. I\n\n[[Page S4459]]\n\nwill, however, at a time mutually convenient, come to the floor and \ngive my response to the Bond amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator from Virginia. I serve on the Armed \nServices Committee under his capable leadership. He chairs that \ncommittee. He is also the longest serving member of the committee that \nI chair, Environment and Public Works. It is very rare that I would \noppose something he is in favor of. This might be that exception. But \nlet me give him our assurance that nothing is going to happen to \ndispose of this amendment until he has adequate time to complete his \nhearing and come down and be heard on this amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nOklahoma for his usual gracious work with his colleagues here in the \nSenate. I will return.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, we have talked about this issue several \ntimes before. The distinguished Senator from Virginia has very strong \nbeliefs. Those beliefs are shared by the ranking minority member and by \nseveral members of our committee. This amendment was added in \ncommittee. It is one I voted against at the time. I did oppose it. \nHowever, I know there are very strong feelings about it and I want to \nmake sure everybody gets to be heard, and I am sure we will end up with \na rollcall vote. I would only make a couple of comments.\n  There are flexible provisions in the underlying bill that will help \nStates address their storm water needs and maintain their ability to \ndetermine how to spend these limited dollars. For that reason I had \nfelt a mandatory 2-percent set-aside in this bill was not necessary.\n  Currently, States are allowed to use their STP funds for \nenvironmental enhancements which include a variety of projects, \nincluding storm water mitigation. Our bill gives States the option to \nuse STP and NHS money for storm water mitigation. Our bill allows those \nStates that wish to use highway money to address storm water runoff and \nhelp communities comply with phase 1 and 2 on clean water runoff to do \nso.\n  I think probably one of the reasons for my opposition to this is I \nspent 4 terms as mayor of a major city, Tulsa, OK. I have always been a \nstrong believer that the closer you get to home, the better the \ndecisions are. In other words, the idea that somehow Washington knows \nmore about my State of Oklahoma than the people in my State of Oklahoma \nis something I have disagreed with.\n  If this amendment should be agreed to and the bill should become law, \nif we in the State of Oklahoma want to spend 2 percent or even more of \nour money for this purpose, we can do it. But if we have other \npriorities that are greater, as determined by those of us in Oklahoma, \nthen I think that should take precedence.\n  For that reason I will respectfully support this amendment. I am sure \nthere will be more discussion on it later on.\n  I am sure the ranking minority member will agree with me, we do not \nwant to do anything further other than hear debate until Senator \nWarner, whose provision it was that was put in the bill in committee, \nhas ample time to debate it and to come to the floor and try to work \nout any compromises he may be successful in working out with the author \nof the amendment, Senator Bond.\n  With that, let me renew our appeal to Members to come down with their \namendments. I am glad we are finally getting some activity here, some \namendments coming down. It is very important we move on with this bill. \nWe have several pages of amendments. I know a lot of these amendments \nare going to be agreed to in a managers' amendment we will be \npropounding before too long. There are some that will have to be fought \nout on the floor. It is my desire, and I am sure the desire of the \nranking minority member, that we get on with these amendments. I have \nbeen here long enough to know what is going to happen. We are going to \nhave all day today to handle amendments, and tomorrow. People are not \ngoing to bring them down. Then when something happens or when cloture \nis filed, everyone is going to get hysterical and say, Why didn't I \nhave time to offer my amendment?\n\n  You may not have time. We are serving warning to you right now, that \ncould happen. Now there is time and we encourage you to come down. This \namendment under discussion now, which the Senator from Indiana has \ngraciously set aside--it is his amendment--is one that will be \ncontroversial and I suspect there will be many members on the minority \nside of our committee who want to be heard. I think they were unanimous \nin supporting Senator Warner in the committee at that time.\n  We hope those people will come down and get the debate out of the way \nso we can proceed with this amendment and with any other amendments \nthat come to the floor. Let's keep in mind, as I said yesterday on more \nthan one occasion, what will happen if we are not successful in getting \nthis bill passed. We are on our sixth extension. The extensions do not \nwork. Our money is not well spent. People are dying on the highways. \nThere are things that are happening that will not happen unless we pass \nthis bill. Without an extension there is not going to be any chance to \nimprove the donor status. My State is a donor State. I remember when it \nwas 75 percent as a guarantee to come back to the States for money paid \ninto the highway trust fund, revenues that were collected in my State \nof Oklahoma. Now it is up to 90.5 percent. If we had been successful \nwith the bill last year, it would have been 95 percent.\n  Senator Jeffords and I did everything we could to get our bill \npassed. We are going to try to make that happen this time. But for \nthose States that are concerned about their donor status, they better \nbe lining up and supporting this. We do not know in conference what is \ngoing to come out in terms of a number, but we do know this: Donor \nstatus of 90.5 percent will at least go up to 91 or 92 percent. So they \nare going to be better off, but not if we operate on an extension. If \nwe operate on an extension, we are not going to have any new safety \ncore programs.\n  They call this SAFETEA. I know there is an effort by the chairman of \nthe committee in the other body to rename it TEALU. I do not have a \nreal problem with that. But it is a safety bill. We have many safety \nprovisions, core programs that respond to the thousands of deaths each \nyear on our roadways. If we go on extensions, we are not going to make \nany of these safety provisions a reality.\n  If we go on extensions instead of a bill, there is not going to be \nany new streamlining. In fact, some of the current obstacles in helping \nus to get roads built and bridges improved can be corrected, but they \ncan only be corrected if we are able to pass this bill. If we operate \non extensions, there is no increased ability to use innovative \nfinancing, thereby giving the States more tools.\n  This is something that is so important. Ever since the Eisenhower \nadministration, we haven't changed the way we fund our road program. \nThere are a lot of ideas out there where we could use the public-\nprivate partnership to build more roads and bridges. In fact, we have \nin this bill a provision that establishes a commission to study various \nways, innovative ways to change the way we finance our roads, highways, \nbridges, and infrastructure in America. But if we are on an extension, \nif we do not pass this bill, we are not going to be able to do that.\n  We have one provision in here, Safe Routes to School, which is one I \nfelt strongly about, but I was not the leader on it. There are several \non our committee as well as over on the House side. As I recall, this \nis one of the programs Congressman Oberstar felt very strongly about. \nIf we operate on an extension, we are not going to have the Safe Routes \nto School Program. We could have deaths of young people as a result of \nour failure to act. That is why this is so important.\n  Certainty in planning: On an extension, there is no certainty. You \nthink we are going to get the same amount of money that was already \nauthorized previously, but nothing else has changed. We don't know what \nis going to happen next year. We don't know whether we are going to \nhave a bill that will be passed a month from now or 2 months from now \nor a year from now. Therefore, there is no long-range planning that can \ntake place.\n  I served in the State legislature in Oklahoma many years ago. I know \nwhen you start planning for the future\n\n[[Page S4460]]\n\nyou have to plan for your contract season. It is not as severe in \nOklahoma as it is in Vermont or some of the Northern States, but \ncertainly these things have to be considered. We have to have our labor \nsupply ready to absorb, to be able to accommodate a heavy schedule of \nconstruction, so we need to be able to plan for that.\n  In this bill we have a border program, Borders and Corridors. It is \nvery important we do these to accommodate the States such as Texas, \nCalifornia, Arizona, and other border States along the northern border, \nto help them out with that program. Without this bill we are not going \nto be able to do that.\n  There are chokepoints. A lot of people think of the highway bill as \njust highways. This is intermodal transportation. It affects railroad \ncrossings. Our State of Oklahoma is a State that has a channel. It \ncomes all the way to my town of Tulsa, OK. A lot of people don't know \nthat. We know there are chokepoints where barge traffic will come up; \nit will go to rail traffic; it will go to truck traffic. This bill \naddresses intermodal transportation and eliminates chokepoints.\n\n  Finally, we have the firewalls. What has bothered me more over the \nyears than anything else I can think of is how people will raid trust \nfunds. Politicians in State legislatures--it has happened here in \nWashington--when no one is looking and there is a large surplus in some \ntrust fund, what do they do with a large surplus, I ask Senator \nJeffords? They run in there and they raid it. Consequently there are no \nreal protections under an extension. But we do have protections in the \nbill that is before you.\n  I have every confidence--I don't want to sound as though I am \ndoubting whether we are going to have a bill. But we need to pass it in \ntime to get it to conference, back from conference, get it voted on, \nand in law by May 31. That is getting very close.\n  In the Senate we will be going into a recess next week. We will not \nbe here for 7 days. It is my expectation as soon as we get back, we \nwill be in a position to finish this bill, get it to conference, and \nmeet this deadline.\n  I know I speak on behalf of our minority member, the ranking member, \nthe Democratic member on the committee, Senator Jeffords, in urging \npeople to come down and offer their amendments.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. If I may interrupt for a moment, I support what you are \nsaying 100 percent. I warn Members they should not give any thought, \nright now, anyway, of believing they do not need to be here. We have to \nget this done. The country needs it.\n  Mr. INHOFE. The Senator and I know they are up there right now. Come \non down.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I join the chairman in urging colleagues \nto bring amendments to the floor. It is time to get this bill out of \nthe traffic jam it is currently stuck in. If we are going to get the \nhighway bill done before the end of May, the Senate needs to accelerate \naction and shift into higher gear. Our States, cities, and towns need \nthis bill. The American public needs this bill. We have heard from the \nNational Governors Association, the National Conference of State \nLegislatures, the Council of State Governments, the National \nAssociation of Counties, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, and the \nNational League of Cities.\n\n  All asking the same thing, get this bill done.\n  The bill before us will strengthen our nation's transportation \nsystem, create hundreds of thousands of jobs, improve the safety of our \nroads, highways and bridges, and support and improve our transit \nsystems.\n  We cannot afford to wait any longer to make these much needed \ninvestments.\n  Our transportation system needs help now: 38 percent of our major \nroads are in poor or fair condition; 28 percent of our bridges are \nstructurally deficient and unsafe for travel; 5.7 billion gallons of \nfuel are wasted annually while motorists sit in traffic.\n  Traffic congestion means longer delays, higher costs, increased \naccidents, more pollution, added frustration and keeps us from spending \ntime with our family and friends.\n  In 2001, according to the American Public Transportation Association, \ncongestion costs to American motorists were nearly $70 billion.\n  Each peak-period road user lost approximately $1,200 in wasted fuel \nand productivity.\n  It is time to get this bill on the fast track and start making some \nprogress.\n  Once again I thank Chairman Inhofe, and Senators Bond and Baucus for \nthe collaborative process in which we have proceeded on this bill.\n  We are ready to take up amendments. I urge my colleagues to come to \nthe floor and offer them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I agree wholeheartedly with the comments \nmade by the ranking member, Senator Jeffords. It is interesting when he \nreads off the list of people anxious for a bill.\n  In the case of Oklahoma, when I was mayor of the city of Tulsa, we \nwere interested in being able to plan ahead. We have our Council of \nGovernments saying they need to have it. We have our State department \nof transportation that says they are going to miss their construction \nseason. We have to get it done.\n  While Senator Jeffords and I many times philosophically disagree, the \nfact we agree so much on getting this bill completed speaks well of \nwhat we are trying to do. It demonstrates the broad base of support. I \ndon't have any doubt we will be able to get passage. The problem is if \nwe do not get the amendments for consideration, it will be a logjam \nwhen we return from recess and could very well be a problem in meeting \nour deadline of May 31. That is what we need to focus on.\n  We are in agreement on most of the provisions. There is some \ndisagreement on the formula. Formulas are always a problem. I have been \nvery happy about the way the Senate has done this. After having spent 8 \nyears in the other body and serving on the Transportation Committee of \nthe House of Representatives, I remember meetings we had. I don't say \nthis in a critical way, but they operate on the basis of projects. We \ndo, too, except the difference is we talk about formulas and try to be \nas equitable as possible and let the States determine their projects.\n  It gets back to the argument, who is in a better position to know the \nneeds of my constituents in the State of Oklahoma? Is it Washington or \nour transportation commissioners responsible to the State legislature \nand the needs in the State?\n  Some people say in an expensive bill, there is pork. There is no pork \nin the bill. There are only two projects in the entire bill. People \nneed to understand that.\n  This will change to some degree when we get to conference because it \nhas to be agreed to by a majority of the conferees on the House, as \nwell as a majority of the conferees from the Senate. To devise a \nformula that no one will disagree with is absolutely impossible. The \nonly choice we have if we look for unanimity in approving a formula \nwould be to have Senator Jeffords and me go to 60 Senators and say we \nwill take care of you and we will forget about the other 40. We would \nhave a bill and do it and it would be perfectly legitimate and not \nunethical.\n  We take into consideration the Interstate Maintenance Program. It \nvaries from State to State. We take into consideration the National \nHighway System, the lane miles, the principal arteries, excluding the \ninterstate VMT on principal arteries, excluding the interstate diesel \nfuel used on highways, and total lane miles on principal arteries \ndivided by population. All these things have gone into the formula.\n  The Surface Transportation Program, which we have talked about, is \npart of the consideration in terms of total lane miles.\n  The Highway Bridge Replacement Rehabilitation Program I am \nparticularly sensitive to because Oklahoma ranks last in terms of the \ncondition of bridges. These things have to be considered.\n  The Recreation Trails Program varies from State to State. There has \nto be something in a formula that will take into consideration these \nprograms.\n  Border planning and operations: Since the passage of NAFTA and now \nthey are considering CAFTA, there are unusual situations taking place \nfrom State to State. We have low-income States. My State, Oklahoma, is \na low-income State. We have low-population States such as Wyoming, \nMontana, and\n\n[[Page S4461]]\n\nsome of the States where they still have to have roads, but they do not \nhave the number of people so that has to be part of the consideration \nand part of a formula.\n  They have low-population density States, high-fatality States. Some \nStates have higher fatalities than other States. That has to be taken \ninto consideration.\n  All these things--donor status, donee status--all are important. But \nthe bottom line is, I can take all 12 or 14 factors and put them into a \nformula program. I can find areas where Oklahoma is not considered as \nwell as Texas or as Vermont. I can find factors that treat Vermont \nworse than they treat Montana or some of the other States. If someone \nis looking to be ahead on all factors, there is not 1 of 50 States that \ncan say they are.\n  I ask our Members to consider that. Formulas consider a lot of \nthings. We have done a good job with the approach we have. It is a \nharder approach to take than the approach the other body uses. It is \neasier for them to get a bill on and off the floor. Timing is \nimportant. There is not a Member of this Senate who does not agree we \nneed to get a bill passed.\n\n  Members may not like the bill as it is. Come on down with amendments. \nWe are waiting for you. We invite Members.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Do I understand, Mr. President, that the amendment that \nwould strike the storm water mitigation provisions from the bill that \nwas reported out by the committee is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to this \namendment. First, I commend the committee, the chairman, the ranking \nmember, and my colleagues, Senator Warner and Senator Chafee, for \nincluding this provision in the legislation before the Senate.\n  This provides for a set-aside of a State Surface Transportation \nProgram for storm water runoff mitigation. All of our local officials--\nour mayors, our county commissioners, and others--say this is essential \nas we address reauthorization of the Surface Transportation Program. It \nis a very modest amount in the overall context of the bill, less than \n$900 million nationwide to meet a very important and pressing need that \nconfronts local governments struggling to deal with the contamination \nof drinking water and the cleanup of streams, rivers, lakes, and ponds \nfrom highway and street storm water discharge.\n  A great deal of the pollution comes from these runoffs off the \nroadways. We are talking about oil, grease, lead, mercury. In my own \nState, where we are working so hard on the Chesapeake Bay, we know the \nrunoff from highways contributes very large amounts of nitrogen and \nphosphorous and sediment to the bay and confronts the State with a very \nserious clean water program.\n  Many of our Nation's highways and roads were built before the \nimplementation of storm water regulations. States are required to have \npollution reduction from new highways under EPA regulations, but we \nneed to have a mitigation program to deal with pollution from existing \nFederal highways and associated paved services. Otherwise, we will have \ngreat difficulty in meeting federally mandated water quality standards. \nThe standards have been put into place. The question now is, How do we \nreach the standards?\n  My colleagues on the committee have done a very skillful job. I, \nagain, commend the chairman, the ranking member, and Senators Warner \nand Chafee who, of course, are on the committee and try and find ways \nto provide help to States and localities in fixing this problem.\n  This is an effort, of course, to make funding available to deal with \nthe storm water impact to water quality and the stream channels. The \nestimates are quite large in terms of what is needed. This amendment \nhas very strong support from a broad range of groups. It is a \nrelatively small amount out of the total highway budget, but it deals \nin a very focused way with a significant problem. It is a very wise \ninvestment of these moneys in order to achieve a very marked \nimprovement with respect to the mitigation of the pollution impacts of \nstorm water discharge.\n  I commend the committee for the work they have done on this \namendment, for its inclusion in the legislation. I very strongly \nsupport the committee bill and very much hope my colleagues will oppose \nthe amendment which would strike a provision that is in the committee \nbill. This amendment takes out of the committee bill a provision \ndeveloped within the committee in a very skillful way that addresses a \nvery important problem. I very much hope my colleagues will reject this \namendment which strikes the storm water mitigation provisions reported \nin the committee.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. If the Senator will yield, I thank him for his \nexcellent presentation. We assure the Senator we are listening and we \nwill take the Senator's advice.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the ranking member very much.\n  What the committee has done is a very important step forward in a \nvery balanced bill. I very much hope we will sustain this provision in \nthe committee-reported bill.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, while we are again encouraging people to \nbring amendments down to the floor, I would like to make some comments \non a statement that was made yesterday that affects our committee, the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee.\n  Yesterday evening, the junior Senator from Delaware discussed his \nhold on Stephen Johnson's nomination to be Administrator of the EPA. \nHis main complaint about Steve Johnson is about a lack of technical \ndata from EPA on Clear Skies. We are talking about the Clear Skies \nlegislation we considered in our committee that the administration has \ncome forth with.\n  But there has been no lack of technical data. The EPA has provided \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee with over 10,000 pages of \nmodeling on costs, job impacts, fuel switching, air quality, and deaths \navoided for the various multi-emissions proposals.\n  This information provides extensive detail about the impacts on the \nNation as a whole, regions, and individual States. Claims that EPA did \nnot supply sufficient information to make an informed decision simply \ndo not have any credibility.\n  In fact, this is in direct contrast to 2002, when then-Chairman \nJeffords--I have been making all kinds of complimentary remarks about \nthe ranking member, Senator Jeffords. Back in 2002, Senator Jeffords \nwas the chairman and I was the ranking member. He came forth with \nsomething he had very strong feelings about, and that was the Clean \nPower Act. When he marked it up, we had less than 1 week to review a \n53-page bill, without any modeling information whatsoever. Let me \nrepeat that: less than 1 week to mark up a 53-page bill, which was \nsubstituted for the original 5-page bill. I do not say that critically \nbecause we did it. Nonetheless, we did it without the information I \nbelieved was necessary at that time. We did not have information.\n  In addition, the quality of information in 1990--this is back when we \nconsidered the Clean Air Act Amendments--paled in comparison to what \nthe executive branch has been able to produce for us using today's more \nsophisticated models run on powerful supercomputers. The committee had \nfar more information about the impacts of the Clear Skies legislation \nthan the entire Senate had in 1990 during the debate on the Clean Air \nAct amendments of 1990.\n  Now, what has been particularly frustrating is that the EPA data \nrequest was used as a red herring to vote against Clear Skies. It is \nnow being used as an excuse to oppose Steve Johnson. I do want to talk \nabout Steve Johnson a minute because it is very unusual we have the \nopportunity to have a Director with the background of Mr. Johnson.\n  When we notified the minority last November 15 of our intentions of \nmarking up the Clear Skies bill in February,\n\n[[Page S4462]]\n\nthey never once raised the issue of needing more data from the EPA \nuntil after we delayed the first markup on February 16. Then they \nmentioned the need to get more data from the EPA almost as an \nafterthought.\n  When we offered to delay the markup 2 weeks, in order to negotiate a \ncompromise, we were told they needed data from EPA, which would take 6 \nmonths to produce. This, of course, was after our committee already \nspent 5 years conducting 24 hearings on the topic. We were told, after \nall this committee work and the 10,000 pages of analysis, that the \nminority still needed more analysis before they would be willing to \neven begin negotiating.\n  Nevertheless, EPA has offered to spend considerable resources to \nanalyze each of the multi-emission proposals using an identical \nmethodology to guarantee that comparisons of the three bills are apples \nto apples. Yet the charge is being leveled that this offer still is not \nenough.\n  Last week, the EPA offered to conduct even more analysis to satisfy \nSenator Carper, offering detailed data on S. 131, the President's Clear \nSkies proposal; secondly, the Clear Skies manager's amendment from \nMarch 9, 2005--that was ours; S. 843, Senator Carper's Clean Air \nPlanning Act; and, fourth, S. 150, Senator Jeffords' Clean Power Act.\n  The data would consist of the cost of each bill; the fuel mix for \nelectricity production; Henry-Hub natural gas prices; average mine \nmouth coal prices; regional electricity prices; emission allowance \nprices; national and regional coal production; the response of electric \ngenerating facilities--for example, the capacity retrofitted with \npollution control equipment; national and State-by-State emission \nlevels for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and mercury; the national \naggregate CO2 emissions; public health and environmental \nprovisions benefits of each bill, such as the total monetized health \nbenefits, premature mortality benefits, and visibility benefits; and \nthe effects of each bill on nonattainment areas--for example, for each \ncurrent nonattainment area, EPA will list the counties in the area and \nproject whether the area comes into attainment with ozone and \nparticulate matter.\n\n  This is for all four pieces of legislation, not just one, everything \nthat has been asked for. This was an unprecedented offer of information \nby the administration to the junior Senator from Delaware and, frankly, \nit is more information than I believe he needs in order to move forward \non Clear Skies. This is in addition to the 10,000 pages of data the \ncommittee has already received. This information would take the staff \nof EPA 6 to 8 weeks to complete.\n  Unfortunately, even this offer is not enough. The junior Senator from \nDelaware is insisting on the same level of analysis that the \nadministration conducted for the President's proposal, which would take \na half a year. Strangely, he insists this would allow him to negotiate \nmultiemissions legislation this spring.\n  This is a level of detail that no administration has ever conducted \nfor a legislative proposal at this stage in the process and, quite \nfrankly, a level of detail that is inappropriate to request. If the EPA \nwere requested to conduct this type of analysis for every bill, we \nwould have to double the size of the EPA, and all of their employees \nwould be working full time on congressional requests. To suggest that a \ncongressional committee needs this type of analysis before it can move \non legislation is ridiculous.\n  In the history of the Clean Air Act, we have more and better quality \ndata today than we have ever had in moving legislation, including the \namendments of 1990. Those are the amendments that were so significant \nand have had such a positive effect on air quality. We have more data \nthan we ever had in moving any environmental legislation.\n  This demand for data was an excuse for delaying the Clear Skies \nlegislation and, quite frankly, it was an excuse to delay or obstruct \nSteve Johnson's nomination. This appears to be part of a larger \nstrategy to obstruct this President's EPA nominees. Last Congress, \nGovernor Leavitt's nomination hearing was first boycotted by the \nminority, then delayed for over 50 days. Today, Steve Johnson is also \nbeing obstructed.\n  For just a moment, I wish to say something about the nomination of \nSteve Johnson to be the next Administrator of the Environmental \nProtection Agency. It is unfortunate we find ourselves in a position of \nhaving that nomination filibustered by the Democratic side. Mr. Johnson \nis not a partisan politician. In fact, he is neither a partisan nor a \npolitician. I can't tell you right now whether he is a Democrat or \nRepublican. I don't think it makes any difference.\n  Steve Johnson is a career EPA employee who has risen through the \nranks under both Republican and Democratic administrations. He joined \nthe EPA during the Carter administration and was promoted to senior \nmanagement posts during the Clinton administration. He has also been \nconfirmed twice by the Senate, both times without opposition. Stephen \nJohnson is not a partisan. He is also a scientist and, if confirmed, \nwould be both the first scientist and first career EPA employee to \nserve as the head of the agency. We never had someone who has a \nscientific background as Administrator of the EPA, nor have we had \nanyone who has gone through the ranks of the EPA. There has never \nbefore been a nominee who has known this agency so well prior to \nbecoming Administrator.\n  One of the big problems we have had with Administrators who are not \nfamiliar with the agency is when we have something that needs to be \ndone, it takes them forever to sort through to find out where the bad \nguys and good guys are and where the reports are coming from. He \nalready knows. He spent 24 years doing this.\n  He is trained in biology and pathology. After graduating from \ncollege, he worked for the Computer Sciences Corporation at the Goddard \nSpace Flight Center and was signed to serve as a junior member of the \nlaunch support team for the first Synchronous Meteorological Satellite, \nSMS-1. He joined EPA during the Carter administration as a health \nscientist in the Office of Pesticides and Toxic Substances. He left EPA \nbriefly in 1982 to join a private lab and then returned in 1984 to \nEPA's Office of Prevention, Pesticides and Toxic Substances. Throughout \nthe years Mr. Johnson climbed through the ranks, eventually being \nappointed to senior management positions by the Clinton administration, \nincluding Deputy Director of the Office of Pesticide Programs and the \nPrincipal Deputy Assistant Administrator at that time.\n  I have to say I was there when this happened during the Clinton \nadministration. I asked him a lot of serious questions, and I did not \nobject to his nomination even though it was propounded by the Clinton \nadministration.\n\n  In 2001, he was nominated by President Bush to serve as the Assistant \nAdministrator for that program office. He was confirmed without \nopposition. Just last year when Mike Leavitt became Administrator he \nwas nominated to the No. 2 spot at the agency. Once again, he was \nconfirmed without any opposition.\n  Steve Johnson's qualifications are beyond question. The question is, \nwhy are we here fighting for cloture on not just a qualified nominee \nbut a nominee who has been consistently promoted by both Democratic and \nRepublican Presidents? I believe Jonathan Adler did a good job \ndescribing this nomination process when he wrote the following in the \nNational Review:\n\n       President Bush's selection of Steven L. Johnson as \n     administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency was \n     universally praised in Washington, D.C. Democrats and \n     Republicans, environmental activists and industry lobbyists \n     all hailed the pick as a positive step for the troubled \n     agency. Stalwart conservative Sen. James Inhofe . . .\n\n  --that's me--\n\n     applauded the choice while the Environmental Working Group's \n     Ken Cook called it a ``spectacularly good appointment.'' The \n     era of good feelings did not last long, however. Once slated \n     for a quick and easy confirmation, Johnson is now the victim \n     of an old-fashioned political obstruction as Senate Democrats \n     again target the administration's environmental policies.\n\n  This isn't the first time in recent history that an EPA Administrator \nhas been held up. In fact, that precedent was set the last time someone \nwas nominated by this President. Governor Mike Leavitt was treated with \nequal courtesy as Steve Johnson. I know some, including the junior \nSenator from Delaware, are now saying: I supported Mike Leavitt and was \nthere for him. But that is simply not accurate.\n\n[[Page S4463]]\n\nIn fact, when the committee was scheduled to vote on the Leavitt \nnomination, the vote was boycotted by the Democrats. Not a single \ncommittee Democrat showed up, including the Senator from Delaware. It \nwas part of the boycott.\n  The three Administrators previous to Mike Leavitt took an average of \n8 days to confirm. Mike Leavitt's confirmation took 50 days, 50 days to \nconfirm a Cabinet-level position for an individual who clearly is \nqualified.\n  So this is nothing new for a qualified EPA Administrator nominated by \nPresident Bush. It has been nearly a month that Steve Johnson has \nawaited confirmation. The time has come to confirm Mr. Johnson.\n  During the debate we will likely hear some negative comments about \nthe President's record on the environment. What you hear from the \nDemocrats will likely be a very distorted view. The facts are very \nplain, very easy to understand. By virtually every measure, under this \nPresident's stewardship, our air, our water, and our land are cleaner. \nWe have a cleaner and healthier environment than we did prior to George \nW. Bush taking over as President. That is simply the simple truth.\n  Just to highlight a few of the actions by the President, he signed \ninto law historic bipartisan legislation that has accelerated the \ncleanup of brownfields--all of the States are concerned about that--\nbetter protecting public health, creating jobs, and revitalizing \ncommunities. George W. Bush is the first President ever to require the \nreduction of mercury emissions by powerplants. I can remember when \nthere were full-page ads during the campaign saying that this President \nis lowering the emissions. There were no restrictions before he came \nin. He is the one who made the first reduction in our history. This \nPresident has imposed a mandatory 70-percent reduction in mercury \nemissions from these sources.\n  Just a year ago, the President announced an aggressive new national \ngoal, moving beyond the policy of no net loss wetlands to a new policy \nof an actual net increase for wetlands each year. His Great Lakes \nLegacy Program will help to clean up one of the largest systems of \nfreshwater on Earth, roughly 18 percent of the world's supply. His \nClear Skies initiative would have reduced SOX, \nNOX and mercury emissions by 70 percent--the largest \nmandated reduction of any President in the history of America. It \nwasn't Bill Clinton. It was George W. Bush.\n  Despite all the rhetoric to the contrary, the environment and our \nfamilies are healthier because of George W. Bush. The facts don't lie.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham). The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n10 minutes as in morning business.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Reserving the right to object, let me say to my good \nfriend from Oregon that the leader is coming down to make a statement. \nWould he withhold his request until the leader gets here and makes his \nstatement?\n  Mr. WYDEN. If I could engage my colleague in a colloquy, I assume the \nleader is going to speak relatively briefly as well. If that is the \ncase, I certainly want to be courteous.

Mr. President, throughout the judicial obstruction debate, \nemotions have run high on both sides. This should remind us all, once \nagain, of the need to return to civility in our Nation's Capitol. The \nAmerican people want their elected leaders to work together to find \nsolutions. To them, doing what is Republican or Democrat matters far \nless than doing what is right for America.\n  Let me briefly discuss how we got here. Never, in 214 years--never, \nin the history of the Senate--has a judicial nominee with majority \nsupport been denied an up-or-down vote until 2 years ago. In the last \nCongress, the President submitted 34 appeals court nominees to the \nSenate. A minority of Senators denied 10 of those nominations and \nthreatened to deny another 6 up-or-down votes. They would not allow \nvotes because they knew the nominees would be confirmed and become \njudges. The nominees had the support of a majority of Senators.\n\n[[Page S4464]]\n\n  Now, in this new Congress, the same minority says it will continue to \nobstruct votes on judges. Even worse, if they don't get their way, they \nthreaten to shut down the Senate and obstruct Government.\n  Throughout this debate, we have held firm to a simple principle: \nJudicial nominees deserve up-or-down votes. Vote for them, vote against \nthem, but give them the courtesy of a vote. Yet judicial nominees have \nnot been given that courtesy. They have gone 2, 3, or even 4 years \nwithout a vote. Now, 46 seats on the Federal bench are vacant as case \nafter case and appeal after appeal stack up.\n  One nominee, Priscilla Owen, has served 10 years as a justice on the \nTexas Supreme Court. She won reelection with 84 percent of the vote in \nTexas. Yet she can't get the courtesy of a vote to be confirmed by the \nSenate.\n  Judicial nominees are being denied; justice is being denied. The \nsolution is simple. Allow the Senators to do their job and vote.\n  In a spirit of civility, and with sincere hope for solution, I make \nan offer. This offer will ensure up-or-down votes on judicial nominees \nafter fair, open, and some might say exhaustive debate. It is a \ncompromise that holds to constitutional principles.\n  First, never in the history of the Senate had a judicial nominee with \nmajority support been denied an up-or-down vote until 2 years ago. \nHowever, it was not unprecedented, either for Republicans or Democrats, \nto block judicial nominees in committee. Whether on the floor or in \ncommittee, judicial obstruction is judicial obstruction. It is time for \njudicial obstruction to end, no matter which party controls the White \nHouse or the Senate.\n  The Judiciary Committee will continue to play its essential oversight \nand investigative roles in the confirmation process, but the committee, \nwhether controlled by Republicans or Democrats, will no longer be used \nto obstruct judicial nominees.\n  Second, fair and open debate is a hallmark of the Senate. Democrats \nhave expressed their desire for more time to debate judicial nominees. \nI respect that request and honor it. When a judicial nominee comes to \nthe floor, we will set aside up to 100 hours to debate that nomination. \nThen the Senate, as a whole, will speak with an up-or-down vote. The \nSenate operated this way before we began to broadcast debates on \ntelevision in 1986. This would provide more than enough time for every \nSenator to speak on a nominee, while guaranteeing that nominee the \ncourtesy of a vote.\n  Third, these proposals will apply only to appeals court and Supreme \nCourt nominees. Judges who serve on these courts have the awesome \nresponsibilities of interpreting the Constitution. So far, only up-or-\ndown votes on appeals court nominees have been denied. I sincerely hope \nthe Senate minority does not intend to escalate its judicial \nobstructions to potential Supreme Court nominees. That would be a \nterrible blow to constitutional principles and to political civility in \nAmerica. I hope my offer will make it unnecessary for the minority to \nfurther escalate its judicial obstruction.\n  Fourth, the minority of Senators who have denied votes on judicial \nnominees are concerned that their ability to block bills will be \ncurbed. As majority leader, I guarantee that power will be protected. \nThe filibuster, as it existed before its unprecedented use on judicial \nnominees in the last Congress, will remain unchanged.\n  The Democratic leader and I have been talking on this issue almost \nevery day. I am hopeful he will accept my offer as a solution. It may \nnot be a perfect proposal for either side, but it is the right proposal \nfor America. For 70 percent of the 20th century, the same party \ncontrolled the White House and the Senate. Yet no minority ever denied \na judicial nominee with majority support an up-or-down vote until the \nlast Congress. These minorities showed self-restraint. They treated \njudicial nominees with fairness, and they respected the Senate's role \nin the appointments process, as designed by the Framers of the \nConstitution. Resolving the judicial obstruction debate for me is not \nabout politics. It is about constitutional principles. It is about \nfairness to nominees. It is about Senators doing their duty and doing \nwhat is right for our country.\n  Arbitrarily voting on just a few judicial nominees, as some have \nproposed, will fail to restore the Senate's 214-year practice of up-or-\ndown votes for all judicial nominees who come to the Senate. Senators \nhave a duty to vote up or down on judicial nominees. Confirm them or \ndeny them but give them all the courtesy of a vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democrat leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, first, I express my appreciation to the \ndistinguished Republican leader for his proposal. I am happy to see we \nare working toward a solution to this very difficult issue that now \nfaces the Senate.\n  I say to my distinguished friend, no matter how many times you say \nit, if something is wrong, it does not become true. Over the course of \nthis country's history there have been many filibusters of judges from \nthe very beginning of our Republic. Until 1917, there was no way to \nstop a filibuster, so a number of judges fell by the wayside as a \nresult.\n  As I said previously, in 1917, the Senate changed its rules, and two-\nthirds of the Senators elected could stop a filibuster. Then, in 1964 \nat the height of the civil rights battle, it was changed to 60 on most \neverything. Only one thing is still different, and that is as it relate \nto rules where it takes 67. Without getting into the numbers game, \nthere have been a lot of filibusters of judges where a majority of the \nSenators liked a nominee. Abe Fortas is a good example of that. We do \nnot need to reinvent history. It is simply the way it is. I am not \ngoing to get into the individual judges. We can do that, we can go over \nthem one by one, but I don't think that is what the country needs at \nthis stage.\n  We have heard in the Senate that 69 judges of President Clinton never \nmade it to the Senate. We continually hear my friends on the other side \nof the aisle say: We need a vote on these judges. They had a vote in \nkeeping with the rules of the Senate.\n  I agree with my friend, the distinguished Senator from Tennessee, for \nwhom I have so much respect and admiration. He said that the circuit \ncourt and Supreme Court are more important than the lower courts. I \nbelieve that, in fact, is the case. That being so, we need to focus \nmore attention on them rather than less.\n  You have to break the rules to change them in this instance because \nif you follow the rules, you cannot do it with a simple majority. If \nyou can break the rules to change the rules on a judge, then what about \nthe other nominations of the President? We have a matter in the Senate \nnow that is in the newspaper every day, regarding a man by the name of \nMr. Bolton. I don't know him. I recognize him because he has a very \nuncharacteristic mustache, which I kind of like. My point is, that may \nbe something that people will wish to talk a long time on. I don't know \nthat to be the case. The hearings have not been completed. But I do \nknow that the administration really likes this man. The Secretary of \nState likes him. She has said so. Does that mean the rules will be \nchanged because this is one of the President's fair-haired persons he \nwants to become his ambassador to the United Nations? We cannot go down \nthat slippery slope.\n  This proposal of Senator Frist is not exactly new. We had a proposal \nlike this last Congress by my friend, the distinguished Senator from \nGeorgia, Zell Miller. It was very similar to this proposal. I don't \nmean to demean the proposal, and I will take a close look at it and see \nif there is a way we can work with it. I would say, for lack of a \nbetter description, it is a big fat wet kiss to the far right. It just \nis not appropriate. The rules are the rules.\n\n  It is unacceptable for a number of reasons. First, this is slow-\nmotion nuclear option. After 100 hours, the rights of the minority are \nextinguished. This has never been about the length of the debate. This \nis about constitutional checks and balances.\n  No. 2, this is probably worse than the nuclear option because it also \nspeeds up the committee's consideration. I am happy to look at that. As \nthe distinguished majority leader knows, I talked to him earlier about \ntrying to do something in the committee system to make it better. I am \nhappy to take a look at that. We will talk in more detail. I don't \nthink this is appropriate.\n\n[[Page S4465]]\n\n  Third, this deals with only half of the advice and consent. We have \nto deal with the pesky little document called the Constitution. This is \nsomething you take as a whole. This is very short, but we have to stick \nwith this and advise and consent.\n  We have failed to recognize we have the future ahead of us, not what \nwent on in the past. I am not here to criticize what went on in the \nClinton years. I am not here to condone or criticize what went on in \nthe last 4 years. I am here to look forward.\n  I say to my friends on the other side of the aisle, any proposal I \nhave made said let's look forward. Let's take this nuclear option off \nthe table, and let's work on these judges we have ahead of us. I can \nnever say there will never be a filibuster because I cannot say that, \nbut I don't think this Senate is in the mood for a number of \nfilibusters. I don't think Members feel like it. We should go forward.\n  I told my distinguished friend, the Senator from Kentucky, I told my \ndistinguished friend--and I say ``friend'' in the true sense of the \nword--from Tennessee, if we somehow fail on the good faith, and they \nthink we filibuster too much, talk too much, you always have the next \nCongress. Let's try to look forward. Let's not look back.\n  I want to leave here today or tomorrow--whenever we leave--with a \ngood feeling. People get locked in: this is not good enough. I am not \ngoing to berate him for this offer he has made. It is an offer. I \nappreciate that. It is the first offer we have had. I have had one. He \nhas had one. Legislation is the art of compromise.\n  While this is not truly legislation, it is in keeping with what we do \nhere. We try to build consensus. We try to work toward an end that is \nsatisfactory. I hope we can do that. I hope calmer heads prevail. I say \nthat on my side as well as the other side of the aisle. If we did it \nright, we would take his suggestion to the Rules Committee, have them \ncome back on it, and we would vote on it here. That is how we change \nrules.\n  I had the good fortune--and I say that without hesitation or \nreservation--to serve for many years on the Ethics Committee. I was \nchairman; I was vice chair. Senator Bob Smith from New Hampshire and I \nworked a full year, we worked hard, trying to change the very difficult \nrules we have in the Ethics Committee, which is part of the Senate \nStanding Rules. We brought it to the Senate after our staff worked \nhundreds of hours. Bob Smith and I worked on it many hours. We were \nrejected. I felt so bad because I personally believe the Senate did the \nwrong thing. But they did it. We tried to comply with the rules. That \nis what we should do here. We both tried to make our case to the \npublic. And I will speak for a while this afternoon, not specifically \non the leader's proposal but about things in general. In the very worst \nway, I want to try to work our way through this.\n  Again, I do not really like the proposal given, but I am not going to \nthrow it away. I am going to work on it and see if I can come back with \nsomething that is in keeping with what I think is the ``Mr. Smith Goes \nto Washington'' scenario. Because I really do believe that even though \nwe are in the minority now--and I have thought about this a lot. I have \nthought about this. If someday in the future--and it will happen; I \nhope I am around to be part of that--I became the majority leader, I \nwould not want this rule. I would not want this rule. I do not know if \nI would have the integrity, intellectual integrity to change it so that \nyou folks could do what I thought was in keeping with the rules. But I \nhave thought about that.\n  We are not always going to be in the minority here. I believe very \nseriously that this is something that every party should have. I say to \nmy friends, and everyone within the sound of my voice, test us. Let's \nsee how we can do in the future. I cannot say there will not be any \nfilibusters, but I think we are going to have a much better situation. \nPeople are very concerned about the Supreme Court, and they should be. \nThey should be. But let's not direct our attention to changing the \nSenate rules for fear of something that may never happen.\n  I repeat, what I would like to do is say there is no nuclear option \nin this Congress, and then move forward on this. And, as I say, they \nalways have the power. I would like to think that a little miracle \nwould happen and we would pick up five seats this time. I guess \nmiracles never cease. But I say, respectfully, to everyone, I think the \nRepublican Senators would have this power next Congress as they do now.\n  So I appreciate my friend making this offer. We have so much to do. \nWe have the highway bill to work on today and finish when we come back. \nWe have the budget, we have the supplemental appropriations bill. We \nneed good feelings around here.\n  As we have indicated, there has been some talk about my closing down \nthe Senate. I have recognized since the Newt Gingrich days that does \nnot work very well. But I do think we would be working as much off our \nagenda as the majority's agenda--a big clash of heads. We would be \ntalking about things we want to talk about and they want to talk about. \nI would hope we can get past that and go on to do some real legislative \nwork in the months to come.\n  I would hope that the legacy I leave and that Bill Frist leaves is \nthat we had two leaders who, in spite of their tremendous political \ndifferences--and we have some different political philosophies--I hope \npeople can look back at us and say: Those are two men who worked very \nhard to try to get this institution to work.\n  I am saying this in good faith. I want the other side, in good faith, \nto trust what we are going to do on the judges in the future. That is \nall I ask.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that after I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum I then be recognized when the quorum call is called \noff.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, the amendment I am offering would remove a \nsubstantive grant of authority the U.S. Department of Transportation\n\n[[Page S4466]]\n\nwill be given under the bill as reported by the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee. The House and Senate have been working for the past 2 \nyears to reauthorize TEA-21. I understand one of the underlying goals \nhas been to improve upon the existing process States must follow from \nproject inception to completion. Many of my colleagues would be amazed \nto learn that on average it takes 8 years to complete a construction \nproject from inception to its completion. Some Members have told me it \ntakes longer than that.\n  While I applaud Chairman Inhofe and Ranking Member Jeffords for their \nwork to make needed improvements in the transportation process, my \nState Department of Transportation in South Dakota has brought to my \nattention a problematic provision they believe will further delay and \ncomplicate further transportation projects across the country.\n  To clarify for my colleagues, section 1605(a) of the underlying bill \nwould grant the Federal Highway Administration the authority to \n``ensure'' that a highway facility ``will consider the preservation, \nhistoric, scenic, natural environment and community values.''\n  I have been unable to get anyone to give me a good explanation as to \nwhy this particular provision was included in the bill. Currently each \nof our respective State Departments of Transportation already follows \nstrict Federal rules when it comes to such things as environmental \nreview, historic preservation, and planning requirements. States also \nhave to follow their own State rules regarding these issues. To give an \nexample, this is the book State DOTs have to follow. This pertains to \nrules and regulations that apply to highway projects. It seems to me to \nbe quite thick already.\n  The amendment I am offering does nothing to take away from the \nexisting environmental reviews, historic preservation, and planning \nrequirements each transportation project is subject to. Very simply, it \nremoves the prospect that this provision will result in the Federal \nGovernment imposing new requirements on top of those already in law or \nrule, including in the subjective area of ``community values.''\n  I believe many of my colleagues would agree the best decisions are \nmade by individuals at the State and local levels. If this provision \nwere to be signed into law, I fear States will be told by the Federal \nGovernment what their community values are. Even more concerning to me \nand my department of transportation is the risk that there will be \nvarying interpretations of community values from State to State and \nregional divisions of the Federal Highway Administration. Our current \ndesign, planning, and construction processes are difficult enough as it \nis.\n  Unless we remove section 1605(a) from this bill, we will effectively \nbe allowing the Federal Highway Administration to tell our States what \ntheir respective community values are. Furthermore, unless we remove \nthis provision, I fear one of the major goals in the reauthorization \nbill, which is project streamlining, will be unachievable. Moreover, \nwhile I certainly heard about this from my own State Department of \nTransportation, I have received letters from the following groups \nsupporting the removal of section 1605(a) of the bill: AASHTO, the \nAmerican Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, has \nwritten asking that this provision be removed; AGC, the Associated \nGeneral Contractors of America; ARTBA, the American Road and \nTransportation Builders Association; the American Highway Users \nAlliance; the American Council of Engineering Companies; the \nTransportation Construction Coalition; and the U.S. Chamber-led \nAmericans for Transportation Mobility Coalition. I will submit for the \nRecord some of those letters that have been sent to us with respect to \nthis particular provision of the bill.\n  I want my colleagues to know what the executive director of AASHTO \nsaid in his letter:\n\n       States should have the flexibility to determine how they \n     will work with other state agencies and local communities to \n     address these values rather than having them dictated by the \n     federal government.\n       NEPA and other environmental laws already provide \n     regulatory oversight. Additional requirements will only \n     burden the project delivery process, which we are tying to \n     streamline.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimus consent that those letters I mentioned \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n         American Association of State Highway and Transportation \n           Officials,\n                                                   April 26, 2005.\n     Hon. James Inhofe,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Inhofe: The American Association of State \n     Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) represent the \n     State transportation agencies in the fifty states, the \n     District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. On behalf of our member \n     States, I urge you to maintain the current commitment to \n     simplifying and expediting the highway project delivery \n     process, and to remove Section 1605(a) of the Safe, \n     Accountable, Flexible, and Efficient Transportation Equity \n     Act of 2005 (S. 732) which--contrary to that commitment--\n     would impose additional requirements and standards for each \n     and every highway project.\n       Specifically, Section 1605(a) of SAFETEA adds language that \n     grants additional authority to the U.S. Department of \n     Transportation to ensure that individual projects on every \n     highway facility are designed to achieve ``preservation, \n     historic, scenic, natural environmental and community \n     values.'' States should have the flexibility to determine how \n     they will work with other state agencies and local \n     communities to address these values rather than have these \n     values dictated by the federal government. In addition, \n     regulatory oversight is already required under the National \n     Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), historic preservation laws \n     and other environmental statutes. Additional requirements \n     will do nothing more than further burden the current project \n     delivery process, which we are trying to streamline.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                     John Horsley,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            The Associated General\n\n\n                                       Contractors of America,\n\n                                                   April 26, 2005.\n     Hon. Daniel Akaka,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Akaka: On behalf of the Associated General \n     Contractors of America (AGC), I am writing to urge you to \n     support a Thune amendment to H.R. 3 that would maintain state \n     and local flexibility over the transportation planning \n     process by striking unnecessary and burdensome requirements \n     contained in Section 1605(a) of the federal highway and \n     transit reauthorization bill.\n       Section 1605(a) adds language that grants additional \n     authority to the U.S. Department of Transportation to ensure \n     that individual transportation projects are designed to \n     achieve ``preservation, historic, scenic, natural \n     environmental, and community values.'' While environmental \n     and historic impacts are carefully considered when designing \n     transportation improvements, the federal government should \n     not dictate what ``values'' are important to states and \n     localities.\n       Current planning requirements establish a highly \n     comprehensive process that effectively enables appropriate \n     agencies and the public to have input on transportation \n     decisions in their communities. Proposals to complicate or \n     add to this process will only add to the length of time that \n     it already takes to deliver transportation projects. We \n     believe Section 1605(a) is contrary to the commitment to \n     streamline the transportation project delivery process, which \n     is critical to addressing the nation's transportation needs.\n       Again, I urge you to support the Thune amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             Jeffrey D. Shoaf,\n\n                                        Senior Executive Director,\n     Government and Public Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n                                    American Road & Transportation\n\n\n                                         Builders Association,\n\n                                                   April 28, 2005.\n     Hon. John Thune,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Thune: On behalf of the 5,000 members of the \n     American Road & Transportation Builders Association, I write \n     in strong support of your amendment to H.R. 3 to reject a new \n     federal directive to states on what they must consider when \n     attempting to meet their own unique transportation \n     challenges.\n       One of the key objectives of the Transportation Equity Act \n     for the 21st Century (TEA-21) when it was enacted in 1998 was \n     to shorten the amount of time transportation improvement \n     projects spend in the environmental review and approval \n     process. To accomplish this objective, the measure included \n     provisions to facilitate concurrent reviews by involved \n     federal agencies and consolidated the transportation planning \n     process.\n       Unfortunately, H.R. 3 injects a number of new planning \n     requirements that states and metropolitan planning \n     organizations (MPOs) must consider in the transportation \n     planning process. Specifically, the measure requires the U.S. \n     Department of Transportation (U.S. DOT) to ensure federally-\n     aided highway improvement projects are designed to meet, \n     among other things, the ``community values'' of an area. In \n     addition, to this objective being entirely subjective and \n     impossible to define, these ``value judgment'' decisions arc \n     best made by transportation planners at the local level--not \n     U.S. DOT officials.\n       Thank you for your leadership on this amendment to strike \n     the new community\n\n[[Page S4467]]\n\n     values standard for highway improvement projects. We urge all \n     senators to support the Thune Amendment and all efforts to \n     avoid adding new federal requirements on state and local \n     planning authorities.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   T. Peter Ruane,\n                                                  President & CEO.\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, in closing, as I have outlined today on the \nfloor--in addition to the views expressed by the leading transportation \ngroups in the country--it is my hope the bill managers will be able to \naccept this commonsense amendment to ensure that community values are \ndecided at the State level and not in Washington, DC.\n  Again, I will close by saying this particular document already \nprovides a tremendous amount of paperwork and regulation and rules that \nState DOTs and those who participate in Federal projects and highway \nfunding issues have to comply with. It certainly seems to me that to \nadd a nebulous and subjective additional requirement of ``community \nvalues,'' one, adds additional paperwork burden and redtape to the \nprocess that is already extensive and, secondly, it allows the Federal \nGovernment to interfere in an area that ought to be decided at a State \nand local level.\n  I hope the managers will accept the amendment. In the event they \ndon't, I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? At this time, \nthere is not a sufficient second.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I request the yeas and nays on my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nRhode Island is recognized for 10 minutes.\n\n\n                           The Nuclear Option\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I will speak on the issue of the so-called \nnuclear option.\n  We are at an important crossroads in our Nation's history today. I \nbelieve my Republican colleagues should think long and hard about the \nlong-term effects of what they are proposing on the vitality and \nutility of this institution that we call the U.S. Senate.\n  As Thomas Paine once stated:\n\n       He that would make his own liberty secure, must guard even \n     his enemy from opposition; for if he violates this duty, he \n     establishes a precedent that will reach himself.\n\n  I believe that this so-called crisis is really an artificial crisis. \nThe Senate has confirmed 206 of President Bush's judicial nominees and \nrejected 10. The Senate has confirmed 95 percent of the President's \nnominees. We have the lowest court vacancy rate since the \nadministration of Ronald Reagan.\n  As almost everyone in this body is aware, President Clinton had over \n60 judicial nominees and 200 executive branch nominees blocked by the \nRepublicans. Many of these nominees were not even granted the courtesy \nof a hearing, let alone a vote. We call this ``pocket filibustering'' \nin the Senate. It was according to the rules, and we followed the rules \nand did not attempt to change the rules. That is the difference today. \nThe Republicans are trying, through extralegal means perhaps, to change \nthe rules of the Senate.\n  Senator Frist and many of my other Republican colleagues have been \ninvolved in both filibustering and pocket filibustering of judicial \nnominees, and they did not object to their own actions or purport to \nsuggest that their own actions were unconstitutional or in any way \nviolated the spirit or the rules of the Senate.\n\n  In 2000, Clinton nominee Richard Paez was filibustered by a number of \nmy colleagues, but Democrats and Republicans defeated the filibuster by \nfinding common ground and, under the rules of the Senate, moved to a \nvote.\n  Although almost every Senator in this Chamber believes that \nbipartisan improvements could and should be made to the nomination \nprocess, this President and the majority have not made any such \nattempts.\n  For example, returning to the tradition of allowing home State \nSenators and/or home State advisory boards to make recommendations to \nthe President regarding eminent lawyers and jurists he should consider \nwhen nominating men and women for lifetime appointments on Federal \ncourts would be one possible way to make this whole process less \npartisan.\n  If we want thoughtful, intelligent men and women to even want to take \non the job of Federal judge, we would all benefit from depoliticization \nof the judicial process.\n  There are many ways President Bush and the Republicans in the Senate \ncould work with Democrats to make the judicial nomination process work \nmore smoothly. But in light of the rejection of the minority leader's \nproposal and the subsequent proposal made by the majority leader, it is \nclear this debate is not really about making the process work better. \nThis whole debate should be seen for what it is--a grab for power.\n  This is not the first time a President, with the help of his own \nparty, has attempted to grab complete and total power over the judicial \nnomination process.\n  In 1937, President Franklin Roosevelt, a Democrat, sent a bill to \nCongress that would have drastically reorganized the judiciary and \nadded up to six more justices on the Supreme Court. Why? Because he \ndidn't like what the Supreme Court was doing to his legislative \nproposals. Although the Senate Judiciary Committee rejected the bill, \nfinding it, in their words, ``essential to the continuance of our \nconstitutional democracy that the judiciary be completely independent \nof both the executive and legislative branches of Government,'' the \nmajority leader, Joseph Robinson, supported the bill and brought it to \nthe floor.\n  A determined group of Senators, using the filibuster for 8 days, \ndefeated this proposal. It was the right to free and open debate that \ndefeated President Roosevelt's attempt to consolidate his power over \nthe judicial branch of Government. It is that same right we are talking \nabout today. It is the right that allows the Senate to play its unique \nrole in our constitutional democracy.\n  One of the most basic concepts behind the construction of the \nConstitution is the concept that absolute power corrupts. After \nfighting a revolution to escape from the tyranny of an absolute \nmonarch, the Founding Fathers were very focused on coming up with a \nsystem of government that would prevent one ruler or one faction of \npeople from controlling all of the mechanisms of power.\n  James Madison believed that ``the causes of faction cannot be removed \nand that relief is only to be sought in the means of controlling its \neffects.''\n  As he stated in Federalist Paper No. 10: ``Among the numerous \nadvantages promised by a well-constructed union, none deserves to be \nmore accurately developed than its tendency to break and control the \nviolence of factions.'' He further goes on to state that ``Complaints \nare everywhere heard from our most considerate and virtuous citizens . \n. . that the public good is disregarded in the conflicts of rival \nparties, and that measures are too often decided, not according to \nrules of justice and the rights of the minor party, but by the superior \nforce of an interested and overbearing majority.''\n  It was the desire of the Founding Fathers to protect the rights of \nthe minority from ``the superior force of an interested and overbearing \nmajority'' which caused them to create three branches of Government.\n  Because of the skills and temperament required of a judge, the \nFounding Fathers decided that judges would not be elected like the \nother two branches of Government but would be nominated by the \nPresident with the advice and consent of the Senate.\n  Article II, section 2 states that the President:\n\n     . . . shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent \n     of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public \n     Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the supreme Court, and all \n     other Officers of the United States, whose Appointments are \n     not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be \n     established by Law. . . .\n\n  In effect, Madison and the Founding Fathers believed that the \nindependence\n\n[[Page S4468]]\n\nof the judiciary was so important that lifelong judicial appointments \nneeded to be made by consensus between the executive and legislative \nbranches. Alexander Hamilton stated in Federalist Paper No. 78 that:\n\n       This independence of the judges is equally requisite to \n     guard the Constitution and the rights of individuals from the \n     effects of those ill humors which the arts of designing men, \n     or the influence of particular conjunctures, sometimes \n     disseminate among the people themselves, and which, though \n     they speedily give place to better information, and more \n     deliberate reflection, have a tendency in the meantime, to \n     occasion dangerous innovations in the government and serious \n     oppressions of the minor party in the community.\n\n  Resonating throughout the Federalist Papers is the notion that the \ntest of this Government is not the success of the majority but the fact \nthat minority rights are protected. Minority rights on this floor could \nbe extinguished if the rules of this Senate are disregarded. This is \nwhy I am here today on the floor of the Senate to speak out.\n  It is important that we do not let another President try to pack the \ncourts. The Senate cannot become merely a rubberstamp for any \nPresident. The independence of the courts is critical to protecting the \nConstitution and the rights of individuals. It is for this reason that \npreserving the right to open and free debate in the Senate is so \nimportant. Indeed, if the Founding Fathers wanted a system of pure \nmajority rule, they would have only created one Chamber.\n  These decisions should not be made on a political whim. The impact of \njudicial appointments outlasts party changes in both the executive and \nlegislative branch of Government. Indeed, some Members of the other \nparty have complained about the abuse of power by ``activist'' judges. \nFrankly, I cannot think of a better way to protect against activist \njudges than by protecting the current cloture rule. If two-thirds of \nthe Senate believes a nominee is qualified for the position and will do \nthe job well, that candidate is probably not going to be an activist \njudge on either the right or the left.\n  Opponents of the filibuster have questioned its constitutionality. \nHowever, time and again, the courts have shown a reluctance to \ninterpret the rules of either House of Congress or to review the \napplication of such rules.\n  The Founding Fathers stated in article I, section 5, clause 2 of the \nConstitution:\n\n       Each House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings.\n\n  Much of the current debate around the Republican leadership's \nproposal to change a 200-year-old Senate tradition regarding the right \nto unlimited debate revolves around rule XXII of the Standing Rules of \nthe Senate. This rule is clearly constitutional. Rule XXII is about the \nprecedence of motions. The relevant part is as follows:\n\n       Is it the sense of the Senate that debate shall be brought \n     to a close? And if that question shall be decided in the \n     affirmative by three-fifths of the Senators duly sworn--\n     except on a measure or motion to amend the Senate rules, in \n     which case the necessary affirmative vote shall be two-thirds \n     of the Senators present and voting--then said measure, \n     motion, or other matter pending before the Senate, or the \n     unfinished business, shall be the unfinished business to the \n     exclusion of all other business until disposed of.\n\n  This rule encapsulates an agreement between the majority and minority \nthat an amendment to the Senate rules is so important that it requires \na two-thirds vote--the same number of votes required to vote on \ntreaties, overcome a Presidential veto, and impeach a President--to \nchange the Standing Rules of the Senate. And beyond all the current \nmaneuvers on the floor, the real goal of the Republican majority is to \nchange the rules of the Senate.\n  In addition to the filibuster, the Senate has adopted other practices \nto protect minority rights, including unanimous consent rules, holding \nlegislation or nominations in committee, and the blue-slip process. \nWhen some of these procedures, in addition to the filibuster, have been \nchallenged, the courts have given deference to the Senate to make its \nown rules on how to deliberate.\n  Clearly, if the majority party is arguing that the filibuster is \nunconstitutional, then certainly all other methods of blocking a \nnomination, including never holding a hearing or vote in committee, \nwould be as well.\n  I daresay the same individuals arguing for the end of the filibuster \nbecause it is unconstitutional would not state that they acted \nunconstitutionally in blocking 60 of President Clinton's judicial \nnominees.\n  In fact, the Constitution is notably silent on what advice and \nconsent means on a Presidential nomination. The majority are \ninterpreting this to mean that each nominee deserves a vote, but the \nConstitution is actually silent on this issue. It is left to the Senate \nto determine what advice and consent really means.\n  I think we are well served by the current rule and 200 years of \nchecks and balances, and we should not give up our right to debate \nwithout realizing the serious consequences this will have on our \ninstitution, not just today but for decades, in fact, the history of \nthis country going forward. Finally, let me talk briefly about the \nclaim that unlimited debate or the filibuster has never been used \nagainst a judicial nominee. That is simply untrue. The first recorded \ninstance occurred in 1881 when Republicans were unable to end the \nfilibuster of Stanley Matthews to the Supreme Court. There were nine \nother occasions in the 19th century when the Senate held no floor votes \non Supreme Court nominations. More recently, the nomination of \nAssociate Justice Abe Fortas to be Chief Justice of the Supreme Court \nand Homer Thornberry to be an Associate Justice failed when they were \nfilibustered on the Senate floor by Republican Senator Robert Griffen \nand others.\n  Our predecessors also believed that certain judicial nominations were \ntoo problematic to be approved. If we are focused on improving the \njudicial nomination process right now, there is much we can do together \nto make it work better. This should be the issue before us today, not \ntaking away the voice of the minority in one of the most important \ndecisions we are asked to make as Senators, protecting the independence \nof the judiciary.\n  I also think we should be talking about real crises on the Senate \nfloor, such as a $422 billion deficit, a historic trade deficit, the \ndevastating budget the majority will be presenting to us this \nafternoon, and the need to stabilize a country in the Middle East that \nwe have been engaged in for more than two years and has cost us \nAmerican lives and billions of dollars. I urge the majority to \nreconsider this ill-advised abuse of power and work with us to forge \nsome solutions to these real crises and to maintain the balance and \nintegrity of our democratic institutions.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nColorado is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendments be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 581 to Amendment No. 567\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk, \namendment No. 581, and I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Salazar] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 581.\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To modify the percentage of apportioned funds that may be \n         used to address needs relating to off-system bridges)\n\n       In section 144(f)(2)(A) of title 23, United States Code (as \n     amended by section 1807(a)(4)), strike ``15 percent'' and \n     insert ``20 nor more than 35 percent''.\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, before discussing my amendment, allow me \nto commend the work of Senator Jeffords and Senator Inhofe and their \nstaffs for their work on this very important bill for the people of \nAmerica. It is good work, and it is about the people's business. This \nis a vitally important bill on a vitally important topic. Without their \nefforts, we would not be where we are today. I look forward to the day \nwhen we can have a transportation bill passed that we can send to the \nPresident for his signature, hopefully very soon.\n  I also wish to say that I am glad we are taking this bill up at this \ntime because the last Congress was not able to\n\n[[Page S4469]]\n\nget it through. We are hopeful this time around that we will be able to \nsucceed. This is an issue which I believe is at the top of the concerns \nof people throughout the country. In my travels throughout the State of \nColorado, county commissioners, mayors, and local people tell me time \nand time again that moving forward with the reauthorization of the \nTransportation Act is something we should do and we should do as soon \nas possible.\n  The amendment that I have proposed addresses a problem that faces \nmany of our States across our country, particularly those States that \nhave many miles of rural roads and bridges. Ensuring that rural areas \nreceive adequate funding to fix the increasing number of structurally \ndeficient bridges in rural America is a priority. I know it is a \nchallenge in Oklahoma, and I know it is a challenge in Vermont.\n  In my State of Colorado, 17 percent of our bridges are in disrepair, \nand many of those bridges are in parts of rural Colorado. Currently, \nthe Federal Bridge Program apportions funds to States for the \nreplacement and fixing of bridges, and for over 25 years the program \nhas directed a minimum of 15 percent of those Federal funds to be used \non bridges on those State and local roads that do not receive any \nFederal aid. We call these bridges off-system bridges.\n  We need to increase the percentage from 15 percent to 20 percent. It \nis imperative when addressing the needs of transportation \ninfrastructure in Colorado and across America that we ensure there is \nadequate funding to address the needs of rural America. Let us make \nclear the scope of this problem. In this country, there are 307,000 on-\nsystem bridges; 23 percent of those bridges are structurally deficient \nor functionally obsolete--23 percent of those bridges are in bad shape.\n  There are 286,000 off-system bridges. Of those 286,000 off-system \nbridges, 30 percent are deficient and in need of repair. And consider \nthis, across this great country of America, over 80 percent of bridges \nare found on non-Federal-aid highways. We must ensure that these \nbridges in rural communities have the kind of repair to ensure the \nsafety and quality of life for the residents of those communities.\n  The House version of this Transportation bill has increased the level \nof funding out of this fund to 20 percent. I agree with the House of \nRepresentatives, and I believe along with the National League of \nCities, the National Association of Counties, the American Public Works \nAssociation, and the National Association of County Engineers that we \nshould do the same thing, and my amendment will do that.\n  Our roads, our bridges, our transit system, our rail lines, and our \nports need assistance to ensure that our Nation has a first-class \ninfrastructure needed to reinvigorate our economy and to make our \ncountry strong and competitive.\n  Senator Inhofe, Senator Jeffords, and their staffs have worked to \nensure that we have a comprehensive bill that addresses these needs. \nThis small fix improves this bill, and I hope my colleagues will join \nme in ensuring it passes the Senate and gets to the President.\n  I will take just a second to address an amendment that we will be \nvoting on shortly, and that is the amendment offered by my colleague \nfrom Missouri, which would essentially take away the 2 percent that has \nbeen allocated in the portion of these funds to deal with the problem \nof storm water discharge. That is an issue which is a reality that \nfaces communities across our country.\n  We have 5,000 communities that will be affected if, in fact, that 2-\npercent allocation is stripped from this particular legislation. It is \nimportant for us to make sure that we are protecting the environment, \nbut it is also important for us to make sure we are supporting the \nlocal and State governments that will benefit from the money that is \ncurrently included in our version of the bill. Therefore, I urge my \ncolleagues to vote against the amendment that has been offered by our \ngood friend from Missouri.\n  Keeping this provision that we are talking about in this bill is \nimportant to the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the Association of State \nand Interstate Water Pollution Control Administrators, the Association \nof Metropolitan Water Agencies, the Association of State Floodplain \nManagers, the Association of Metropolitan Sewerage Agencies, and \nothers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I am happy to work with the Senator from \nColorado on the needs of his particular State. This measure before us \nwould enable his State to spend more on bridges if that is the need but \nto require States to spend 5 percent more where in our State for \nvarious reasons we only spend a minimum of 15 percent, and other States \nmay be in our same situation, I am very much concerned about a mandate \nbecause we have bad bridges, but we kill people on our highways. We \nkill people on our highways because we have two-lane highways that are \ncarrying heavy truck traffic and passenger traffic that warrant four \nlanes. Rebuilding bridges is not going to solve that problem. So for \nour State, this would be a real problem.\n  As chairman of the subcommittee, I would be happy to work with the \nSenator to see if we can reach an accommodation, but I am very much \nconcerned about what I think the gist of his amendment is.\n  I believe the Senator from South Carolina has a brief statement. I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 3 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. DeMint are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I see my distinguished colleague from \nColorado. I believe I was to follow him. Is that the order? I do want \nto adhere to the order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no order in effect.\n  Mr. WARNER. I want to address the amendment of the distinguished \nSenator from Missouri, Mr. Bond, which is one of several pending \namendments. If the Chair so desires, could we ask our colleague from \nColorado, is this a matter related to the bill? We need some \norientation so that I can accommodate the Senator from Colorado or he \ncan accommodate me, as the case may be.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. If the distinguished Senator from Virginia would give me \n30 seconds, I will make my point.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator is ever so generous. Let's give him a full \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. I thank the distinguished Senator from Virginia.\n  I say this to my distinguished friend from Missouri: I believe the \nneeds of rural America, especially with respect to transportation, are \nimportant. I believe having legislation here that would change the \npercentage allocation by 5 percent, so we could have the rural bridges \nof our country have more resources to be able to get the job done, is \nsomething that is very important. I accept his offer to work with him, \nand look forward to seeing how we can address the needs of rural \nAmerica with respect to the rural bridges we have across our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise to address the underlying bill \nwhich, in markup in the committee on which I am privileged to serve, \nwas a markup of 17 yeas and 1 nay.\n  I rise in opposition to the Bond amendment. I hasten to point out \nthis body has already disapproved the Bond amendment when they approved \nthe earlier highway bill. This body has acted and approved the current \nmark that is in the underlying bill, which my good friend from Missouri \nseeks to strike.\n  What is this all about? In its simplest form, it is the mayors and \nthe county supervisors and those officials in the State entrusted with \nthe supervision of the construction, modernization, improvements, and \nrenovation of our road system, usually the assistant secretary for \ntransportation or whatever it is designated in the State--it is a whole \nrealm of State officials on one side. I\n\n[[Page S4470]]\n\nwill call it by one name, the mayors. It is the mayors versus my good \nfriend from Missouri, Mr. Bond. The mayors desperately want to keep \nintact the bill as written by the committee and keep this provision \nwhich helps these individuals deal with a mandate from the Congress of \nthe United States under the Clean Water Act, which says you must, in \nnew construction, and as they rehabilitate the existing road system, \ndeal with storm water runoff. That runoff contributes up to 50 percent \nof the total storm water which is daily worsening our drinking water. \nThat is a quick synopsis.\n  Now I would like to go into a somewhat more lengthy dissertation. I \nexpress my strongest opposition. I should say I urge colleagues to \naffirm the markup of the committee. Leave the bill as it is. But to do \nso, we have to oppose the Bond pending amendment.\n  The program is urgently needed to fund local governments, the mayors \nand the supervisors, to reduce the runoff of polluted water. As I say, \nthis was already approved by the Senate when they approved the first \nhighway bill. There is no change of the language in the amendment I put \nin and incorporated in the markup of the bill. It was included and \npassed by the Senate last year.\n  The bill in its present form--and this provision, the Warner \namendment, is in the bill--will for the first time begin to address the \nunfunded mandates affecting our local communities. It helps the mayors \nand the boards of supervisors and others deal with the unfunded mandate \nplaced upon them with regard to the storm water runoff. I regret that \nmy colleague opposes helping our localities with such serious financial \nburdens as now imposed on them by the Clean Water Act.\n  The rest of the story is that the Clean Water Act requires all of our \ncommunities to obtain permits for their storm water discharge. Along \nwith this requirement comes the mandate that local governments are to \nfund projects that will control storm water runoff. These can be very \nexpensive projects. Again, our existing highways are up to 50 percent \nthe contributors to the problem associated with storm water runoff \naffecting our drinking water and other clean water uses.\n  Look at this debate we are having now as one regarding public health. \nWhat is more important to us than our clean drinking water? It is a \nmatter of public health. Local governments that finance and manage our \npublic drinking water systems tell me and they tell you, every one of \nyou, it is becoming more and more difficult and more expensive to \nfilter and treat our drinking water to remove the pollutants, many of \nwhich derive from storm water runoff, particularly from our roads. Stop \nto think of the contamination that exists on the roads that accumulates \nover the use of the road. Along comes one of our greatest gifts, a rain \nshower, and it takes those pollutants and runs them off and they find \ntheir way into our drinking water.\n\n  Many organizations that are on the front lines dealing with the \nproblem strongly support this very modest provision to begin to address \npollution for the existing highway structures. I point out that we have \nalready acted in this body in previous legislation to say all new \nconstruction will have set aside by the States as required the funds \nnecessary to deal with the storm water runoff from new construction. \nThis measure very modestly is to take care of the existing road \nstructures--when they need to be repaired at times, when they need to \nbe upgraded.\n  I will bet I could go to dozens of places in my State, and each of \nyou could go to places in your State, where you have new construction \ngoing on over here and it is funded to handle the storm water runoff, \nand not a mile distant is one of the old roads which doesn't have the \nprecautions, and the runoff from both feeds the same stream which then \ngoes into our water supplies. So unless you correct the old system, \nwhat is the sense of trying to correct the new system, in many \ninstances? Stop to think about that. We have already exercised our \nwisdom to make sure the new construction is adequately financed and \nthis is but a modest provision to finance the existing system.\n  It is a small provision. It is $170 million a year--$170 million a \nyear out of a $284 billion bill. It will help more than 5,000 local \ncommunities in each of our States. Most importantly, our States \nthemselves want this program. The Association of State and Interstate \nWater Pollution Control Administrators, our State officials responsible \nfor improving the water quality of our rivers and lakes and streams, \nhas written to each of us urging that the Senate retain the markup \nwhich was approved--again, 17 to 1 in the committee.\n  I refer my colleagues to a portion of the letter from the State and \nInterstate Water Pollution Administrators:\n\n       Communities throughout the Nation, including numerous \n     smaller towns and counties, are required under the Clean \n     Water Act to obtain discharge permits for storm water. Even \n     those communities which have long understood the value of \n     protecting their drinking sources and recreational sources \n     from storm water impacts are hard-pressed to absorb the costs \n     of discharges from the highways. This presents an unfair \n     burden to these small communities, and we believe it is fair \n     for the transportation funding system to help remedy this \n     problem where existing highways and other roads cause \n     significant runoff problems.\n\n  Storm water runoff is an $8 billion national problem. Yet there is no \nfinancial assistance to help our localities with the existing road \nstructure. The storm water program in this bill takes the first step. I \nam very proud, indeed humbled, to represent these small communities. I \nurge my colleagues to let this bill remain as is.\n  The Association of Metropolitan Sewerage Agencies, representing our \nmunicipally owned sewage treatment plants, has joined in this debate.\n  I ask unanimous consent that several letters I have from the various \nState organizations be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. WARNER. This organization likewise has written in strong support \nof the committee's storm water provision. They also cite the undisputed \nfact that polluted storm water from impervious surfaces such as roads \nis a leading reason why nearly 40 percent of our Nation's waters fail \nmeeting our Nation's water quality standards.\n  Similar letters of strong support have come from the U.S. Conference \nof Mayors which emphasize ``absent some . . . [other Federal funding] \nstorm\nwater pollution cleanup costs, including loadings attributable to the \nFederal highway system will be borne largely by local taxpayers through \nproperty taxes and other general taxes and wastewater utility fees.''\n  Hear this: These are your mayors reaching out to you for help.\n  I could go on. I have a great many letters. I am pleased to say our \ndistinguished Governor of Virginia, Mark Warner, states:\n\n       A program such as this could help improve water quality in \n     the Chesapeake Bay, and other watersheds in the Commonwealth.\n\n  The Virginia Association of Counties has strongly endorsed this \nprogram with the view that these provisions, reserving less than one-\nthird of a penny of every highway dollar, are a very modest commitment \nto an enormous challenge before local governments struggling with \ncontamination of drinking water from highway/street storm water \ndischarge. The support for the committee's provision is strong because \neveryone recognizes that storm water runoff from highways is a known \nimpediment to good water quality.\n  Accordingly, from the Environmental Public Agency, storm water runoff \nis the leading cause of pollution for nearly half of our rivers, lakes, \nand streams.\n  Roads collect pollutants from tailpipe emissions, brake lines, oil, \nand other sources. During storms, they mix with other contaminants of \nheavy metals and road salts that wash into our waters, and eventually, \nregrettably, work their way, in many instances, into our drinking \nwater.\n  Today, every new highway must include methods to control this runoff. \nWe have already spoken to this issue, spoken to this need, and funded \nin connection with new construction. I am talking about a very modest \namount, one-third penny, to help these existing road systems.\n  We are here to help our local communities. The mayors have reached \nout. The chairman of the Board of Supervisors has reached out. Those \nfolks that come to our offices and visit, we slap them on the back, and \nthey leave\n\n[[Page S4471]]\n\nthat office thinking they are going to get help. This is the kind of \nhelp they need. It is not much, one-third of one penny of every highway \ndollar.\n  The demands of those who are in opposition to this--namely, the road \nbuilders, and I am not speaking disrespectfully--have powerful lobbies, \nunlimited requirements. This is one-third of one penny for the mayors.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                 The United States\n\n\n                                         Conference of Mayors,\n\n                                  Washington, DC., April 25, 2005.\n     Hon. James M. Inhofe,\n     Chair, Environment & Public Works,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. James M. Jeffords,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Environment & Public Works \n         Committee, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Inhofe and Ranking Minority Member Jeffords: \n     On behalf of The United States Conference of Mayors and the \n     hundreds of cities we represent, I write to convey our strong \n     support for the stormwater provisions of your Committee-\n     approved SAFETEA plan to renew the nation's surface \n     transportation programs.\n       These provisions, reserving less than 1/3 of a penny on \n     every authorized dollar, is a very modest commitment to an \n     enormous challenge before local governments struggling with \n     contamination of drinking water and cleanup of streams, \n     rivers, lakes and ponds and highway and street stormwater \n     discharge, including oil, grease, lead and mercury. Moreover, \n     we have been assured that these provisions limit funding to \n     actual facilities on the federal aid system, which is a \n     critical factor underlying our support of this program. This \n     is important to the nation's cities since it ensures that \n     users of these systems contribute something to the broader \n     efforts under the Clean Water Act to reduce pollutants from \n     the nation's major highways and roads.\n       Absent some commitment to retrofitting existing facilities \n     on the federal aid system during this renewal period, \n     stormwater pollution cleanup costs, including loadings \n     attributable to the federal aid system will be borne largely \n     by local taxpayers through property taxes, other general \n     taxes and wastewater utility user fees.\n       Finally, we disagree with the claim that this is a \n     diversion of funds from highway construction and highway \n     capacity needs. It is the belief of the nation's mayors that \n     improved performance, whether it is pavement quality, the \n     deployment of technology, or its stormwater quality features, \n     are priorities for the nation as we work with you to provide \n     a modern and fully functional transportation system for our \n     citizens and their communities and regions.\n       America's mayors thank you for making these provisions part \n     of your SAFETEA legislation and urge you to preserve this \n     important commitment to stormwater pollution abatement \n     efforts during your conference committee deliberations with \n     the House. If you have any questions, please contact our \n     Assistant Executive Director for Transportation Policy Ron \n     Thaniel.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Tom Cochran,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n         Association of State and Interstate Water Pollution \n           Control Administrators,\n                                   Washington, DC, April 22, 2005.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the Association of State and \n     Interstate Water Pollution Control Administrators (ASIWPCA), \n     I urge your support for the Highway Stormwater Discharge \n     Mitigation Program, Section 1620 of the Senate SAFETEA bill, \n     S. 1072, in the 108th Congress. This new and modest program \n     is designed to address stormwater runoff from the nation's \n     existing transportation system. Stormwater runoff is a \n     significant source of water pollution affecting large and \n     small communities, as well as fish, wildlife and the natural \n     environment.\n       Stormwater pollution results from paving over naturally \n     porous ground, resulting in impervious surfaces that collect \n     pollutants and increase overland stormwater volume and \n     velocity. Stormwater becomes a direct conduit for pollution \n     into the nation's rivers, lakes, and coastal waters. Studies \n     have shown that roads contribute a large number of pollutants \n     to urban runoff--metals, used motor oil, grease, coolants and \n     antifreeze, spilled gasoline, nutrients from vehicle exhaust, \n     and sediment. For example, the stormwater discharge from one \n     square mile of roads and parking lots can contribute about \n     20,000 gallons of residual oil per year into the nation's \n     drinking water supplies. Highways can increase the annual \n     volume of stormwater discharges by up to 16 times the pre-\n     development rate and reduce groundwater recharge.\n       Communities throughout the nation, including many smaller \n     towns and counties, are required under the Clean Water Act to \n     obtain discharge (NPDES) permits for their stormwater. Those \n     communities, which have long understood the value of \n     protecting their drinking water sources and recreational \n     waters from stormwater impacts, are hard-pressed to absorb \n     the costs of discharges from highways in addition to their \n     other stormwater management responsibilities. This presents \n     an unfair burden to these communities and we believe it is \n     fair for the transportation funding system to help remedy \n     this problem where existing highways and other roads cause \n     significant runoff problems.\n       We urge you to continue to demonstrate your leadership in \n     protecting America's waters by supporting the stormwater \n     mitigation provision in SAFETEA. We appreciate your \n     willingness to consider the views of the State and Interstate \n     Water Pollution Program officials responsible for the \n     protection and enhancement of the nation's water quality \n     resources.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Arthur G. Baggett, Jr.\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                       Association of Metropolitan\n\n\n                                               Water Agencies,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 22, 2005.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the nation's largest publicly \n     owned drinking water systems, I write today to express \n     support for section 1620 of the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, \n     and Efficient Transportation Equity Act of 2005, (S. 732), \n     which would provide $870 million over five years for \n     stormwater mitigation projects.\n       This language makes progress toward addressing the billions \n     of dollars in costs that state and local governments will \n     incur to control stormwater generated by our nation's \n     highways.\n       Stormwater runoff has a significant effect on thousands of \n     miles of the nation's rivers and streams. The bill \n     acknowledges this impact and assists states and local \n     communities in addressing this growing water quality problem.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Diane VanDe Hei,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                       Association of Metropolitan\n\n\n                                            Sewerage Agencies,\n\n                                                   April 22, 2005.\n     Re Support for S. 732 and the Highway Stormwater Discharge \n         Mitigation Program.\n\n     Hon. James M. Inhofe,\n     Chair, Environment and Public Works Committee, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. James M. Jeffords,\n     Ranking Member, Environmental and Public Works Committee, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Inhofe and Senator Jeffords: We are writing \n     to express our strong support for the Safe, Accountable, \n     Flexible and Efficient Transportation Equity Act of 2005 \n     (SAFETEA) (S. 732) as passed March 16 by the Senate \n     Environment and Public Works Committee. The Committee's bill \n     includes a provision to authorize $867.6 million over five \n     years for stormwater mitigation projects, using just 2% of \n     the Surface Transportation Program funds. Such projects \n     include stormwater retrofits, the recharge of groundwater, \n     natural filters, stream restoration, minimization of stream \n     bank erosion, innovative technologies, and others.\n       According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, \n     polluted stormwater from impervious surfaces such as roads is \n     a leading cause of impairment for nearly 40% of U.S. \n     waterways not meeting water quality standards. Roadways \n     produce some of the highest concentrations of pollutants such \n     as phosphorus, suspended solids, bacteria, and heavy metals.\n       AMSA represents hundreds of publicly owned treatment works, \n     many of which have municipal stormwater management \n     responsibilities. Your continued support for S. 732, \n     including the Highway Stormwater Discharge Mitigation \n     Program, would provide much-needed support to these \n     communities. Thank you for your leadership and please feel \n     free to contact me at 202/833-4653 if AMSA can provide you \n     with additional information.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                         Ken Kirk,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                              Trout Unlimited,\n\n                                                   March 15, 2005.\n     Re Support of Highway Stormwater Discharge Mitigation Funding \n         in the Transportation Bill.\n\n     Hon. Jim Inhofe,\n     Chairman, Environment and Public Works Committee, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Inhofe: Trout Unlimited, the nation's leading \n     trout and salmon conservation organization, urges you to \n     support funding to mitigate stormwater runoff in this year's \n     transportation bill. A similar provision, Section 1620, the \n     Highway Stormwater Discharge Mitigation Program, was included \n     in last year's Senate transportation bill, S. 1072.\n       Stormwater runoff is a significant source of pollution for \n     all the nation's waters, and is a major cause of trout and \n     salmon habitat loss. Roads are a major source of stormwater \n     runoff. Road building in the United States has created \n     millions of miles of impervious surfaces that collect water \n     and pollutants. When mixed with rain and melting snow, these \n     pollutants flow unimpeded into nearby streams, undermining \n     water quality and warming water temperatures to the point \n     where trout habitat is damaged. Furthermore, excessive and \n     poorly designed road building through watersheds can turn \n     normal rainstorms into small flash floods that scour stream \n     bottoms and de-stabilize stream banks, leading to poorer \n     quality streams over time.\n\n[[Page S4472]]\n\n       Congress has recognized that runoff pollution from highways \n     lowers water quality and destroys habitat in receiving waters \n     in previous highway bills (ISTEA and TEA-21), but has not yet \n     succeeded in getting adequate funding directed at curbing \n     this pollution. In 2000, EPA estimated at least $8.3 billion \n     over 20 years in local funding needs to address stormwater \n     requirements. The time to take action is now as you consider \n     the new Highway Bill.\n       In addition to providing much-needed funding, the bill \n     encourages projects with the least impact on streams and \n     promotes the use of non-structural techniques, such as \n     created wetlands, to mitigate the negative impacts of storm \n     water. These approaches are generally more cost-effective and \n     do more to protect and improve water quality and protect \n     habitat.\n       Thank you for your support of this important provision in \n     this year's transportation bill.\n           Sincerely yours,\n\n                                                  Steve Moyer,\n\n                                Vice President, Government Affairs\n     and Volunteer Operations.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         Commonwealth of Virginia,\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                                   April 19, 2004.\n     The Hon. John W. Warner,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Warner: As always, the Commonwealth deeply \n     appreciates your efforts to improve our environment as well \n     as our transportation system. I am writing to provide my \n     strong support for your amendment to the Senate Surface \n     Transportation Reauthorization Bill that provides for a \n     highway stormwater discharge mitigation program.\n       A program such as this could help to improve water quality \n     in the Chesapeake Bay, and other watersheds in the \n     Commonwealth. Virginia is prepared to work with you and other \n     states to ensure that these funds can be flexibly managed by \n     VDOT to achieve our shared goal of improving stormwater \n     discharge from existing or future federal-aid highways.\n       I appreciate your continuing support of the many and varied \n     interests across the Commonwealth. I look forward to \n     furthering these interests through the reauthorization of the \n     Surface Transportation Act.\n           Sincerely,\n     Mark R. Warner.\n                                  ____\n\n                                          Commonwealth of Virginia\n\n\n                                            County of Fairfax,\n\n                                Fairfax, Virginia, April 27, 2005.\n     Senator John W. Warner,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Warner: I am writing to you in my capacity as \n     the President of the Virginia Association of Counties (VACO) \n     to urge your continued support for the stormwater provisions \n     of your Committee-approved SAFETEA plan to renew the nation's \n     surface transportation programs.\n       These provisions, reserving less than 1/3 of a penny on \n     every authorized dollar, are a very modest commitment to an \n     enormous challenge before local governments struggling with \n     contamination of drinking water and cleanup of streams, \n     rivers, lakes and ponds from highway and street stormwater \n     discharge, including oil, grease, lead and mercury. Moreover, \n     I have received assurances that these provisions limit \n     funding to actual facilities on the federal aid system, which \n     is a critical factor underlying my support of this program. \n     This is important to the local governments since it ensures \n     that users of these systems contribute something to the \n     broader efforts under the Clean Water Act to reduce \n     pollutants from the nation's major highways and roads.\n       Absent some commitment to retrofitting existing facilities \n     on the federal aid system during this renewal period, \n     stormwater pollution cleanup costs, including loadings \n     attributable to the federal aid system, will be borne largely \n     by local taxpayers through property taxes, other general \n     taxes and wastewater utility user fees.\n       As Fairfax County and other localities within the \n     Chesapeake Bay watershed work to limit stormwater runoff and \n     improve the Bay's health, I ask that you and your colleagues \n     show your support for this critical component of SAFETEA. It \n     is vital that environmental mitigation efforts are regarded \n     as an integral feature of a safe and efficient national \n     transportation network.\n       I appreciate your making these provisions part of your \n     SAFETEA legislation and urge you to preserve this important \n     commitment to stormwater pollution abatement efforts during \n     your conference committee deliberations with the House.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                   Gerry Connolly.\n\n  .The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, obviously, my good friend, the Senator from \nVirginia, and I view this very differently. I will outline some of the \ndifferences we have.\n  Let me clarify. The Senator from Virginia noted that the bill passed \nlast year in the Senate with the storm water provision included. I ask \nmy colleagues to recall that we did so only with the agreement that I \nwould not raise it in the Senate in order to get it to conference, and \nwe would address it in conference. I did so out of deference to my \ncolleagues to get the bill off the floor and to conference in what \nturned out to be the vain hope we could get a conference agreement on \nthe bill which we badly needed last year.\n  I did not want to hold up progress on the bill last year. We did not \nhave time to debate it fully. But this year, we have time to debate it \nfully. It is appropriate we do so.\n  First, let me address the concept that this is a modest amendment, a \nsmall amendment.\n  Back home, $900 million is not a small amount. I live in a State \nwhere $900 million means a whole lot. Do you know to whom it means a \nlot? It means a lot to the mayors. The mayors want safety for their \ncitizens. These are community leaders who come to Washington to talk to \nme about how badly they need the money for their roads.\n  I don't think $900 million is small. I don't think we should take \n$900 million from the highway, bridge, transit construction budget.\n  But if Senators think their State has more than enough highway \ndollars and can afford to give money away for storm water, I would be \nglad to know that as we move forward on appropriations matters and \nother matters dealing with transportation.\n  With respect to what this underlying bill will do, section 1620, \nwhich was sponsored by the Senator from Virginia, mandates States set \naside 2 percent of the funds in their main highway accounts--nearly \n$900 million total over the life of the bill--to be used only, \nregardless of need, on storm water mitigation activities.\n  If allowed to remain in the bill, the mandatory set-aside would force \nall States to divert $740 million from their Surface Transportation \nProgram funds. The mandatory set-aside would also force States to \ndivert over $125 million from the Equity Bonus Program set up to help \nalmost every State receive more transportation. That is where I get the \n$900 million figure.\n  However, if this figure is struck, if the State of Virginia or any \nother State wants to use it, storm water mitigation activities are \nalready eligible for funding. States can spend up to 20 percent of a \nproject's cost using STP funds on storm water mitigation if they \nchoose. The underlying bill also expanded funding eligibility for storm \nwater mitigation by adding it to the eligible activities. The National \nHighway System program states they will be able to spend up to 20 \npercent of a project's costs using NHS on storm water mitigation if \nthey choose.\n  I have already listed what the impact of the mandatory set-aside \nwould be. The occupant of the chair is from Minnesota. That would be a \n$17.7 million hit on Minnesota. In addition, the State of Virginia \nwould have to set aside $23 million. But I guess they would want to use \nthat money on storm water anyhow.\n  Mr. WARNER. Will the Senator yield?\n  If the Senator is reading from the same statistics, give the full \ninformation.\n  The Senator said to our distinguished Presiding officer of Minnesota \nthat indeed $17 million would be taken out of the asphalt and concrete. \nBut I point to the next column: Your State holds $471 million under the \nmandate by the EPA for clean water. I have calculated that $17 million \nis helping, in a very modest way, the obligation of your State for $471 \nmillion to meet the mandate put on by the Senate and House of \nRepresentatives.\n  I know, as a former Governor, how you----\n  Mr. BOND. I would like to respond and finish my presentation. Then we \ncan get into a discussion.\n  Mr. WARNER. I have always admired the Senator for so many reasons. I \nreally regret to be out here so forcefully taking him on with his arm \nin a sling.\n  Mr. BOND. You have no conscience.\n  Mr. WARNER. No conscience.\n  I ask you--you are out here accusing me of putting in a mandate--how \nmany\n\n[[Page S4473]]\n\nmandates in this bill are you the author of?\n  For instance, Safe Walks to Schools--hurray. I am all for it. Very \ngood one.\n  Mr. BOND. I didn't support that.\n  Mr. WARNER. I beg your pardon?\n  Mr. BOND. I didn't vote for that. I will address that at some point.\n  Mr. WARNER. Do you have a question to put to me?\n  Mr. BOND. I thought I had the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri has the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. But I will get it back.\n  Mr. BOND. All good things come to an end. I appreciate the comments. \nI was going to address the need for clean water, but my good friend \nfrom Virginia is saying we need to make this into a water bill. He said \nwe need to fund local water projects for Governors.\n  I thought this was a transportation bill. I have already pointed out \nthat the States can use up to 20 percent of STP in the national highway \nfunds on storm water mitigation. But there are lots of unfunded \nmandates that this body has put, in the past, on our local governments \nto clean up local water.\n  Do you know something. For the last dozen years, I have fought as \nchairman of the VA-HUD Appropriations subcommittee, with my colleague \nand very good friend, Senator Mikulski of Maryland, to provide the \nfunds we need to try to help States and local governments meet their \nobligations.\n  There is something called the State revolving funds, and every year \nthe Office of Management and Budget--it does not matter whether it is a \nRepublican or Democrat--cuts it. Those are the most important funds we \ncan provide. We put in over $2 billion each year. It gets cut. We put \nit back in the next year to go into the State revolving funds. Senator \nMikulski and I have funded hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars \nof water cleanup projects in various States--including Virginia, I am \nproud to say, a State of which I am very fond--and helping them deal \nwith their clean water needs.\n  This is a transportation bill. I hear a lot from mayors and local \ngovernment officials. They need transportation. There are waters needs, \nyes, but these water needs are about $200 billion--$200 to $250 \nbillion--and unfunded. We could take the entire transportation budget, \ndump it into water, and still not meet the needs.\n  He has talked about how important safe drinking water is for health. \nAnd I agree. Really, it is one of the best environmental investments we \ncould make. But when you are talking about public health, let's talk \nabout the slaughter on the highways. The whole purpose of this bill is \ncalled SAFETEA. The administration says, and I believe, we need to make \nour highways safer. We kill three people a day or more on Missouri \nhighways. Over 365 of those people die every year because our highways \nare inadequate. We have narrow two-lane roads that really should be \ndivided four-lane highways, and people get killed on them. Jobs do not \ncome to town when we do not have adequate roads. We contribute to \npollution when we tie up traffic on these roads. We need to put these \ndollars to work.\n  As I said, the good Senator from Virginia mentioned the mayors \nsupport it. Well, my mayors support money for highways and bridges and \ntransportation. But I can tell you, the States strongly support my \namendment. They do not want their hands tied by a new Federal mandate. \nWe have too many mandates in this bill, and I would be willing to take \na look at some of the others.\n  But the State departments of transportation want and need the \nflexibility to spend their own highway dollars. That is why the \norganization of State highway directors, AASHTO, said: ``We need your \nimmediate help.'' They absolutely want the help of every person in this \nbody to support the Bond amendment to strike section 1620. They say:\n\n       Section 1620 mandates that States set-aside 2%. . . . This \n     will divert $867 million from a core program that provides \n     funding for highway, bridge and transit construction, \n     rehabilitation and repair. If this provision is removed, any \n     State can continue to spend up to 20% of a project's cost on \n     storm water activities--but at the discretion of the State.\n\n  So here we are asking this body to be, again, a ``daddy knows best.'' \nWe are going to tell States they have to spend $900 million--which is \nnot much in ``Washington speak,'' but it is an awful lot in my ``home \nState speak''--for storm waters.\n  I have already submitted the letters of support. Let me give you some \nmore of the organizations, in addition to AASHTO: the United \nBrotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America, Laborers-\nInternational Union of North America, the International Union of \nOperating Engineers, the International Association of Bridge, \nStructural, Ornamental and Reinforcing Iron Workers, the American \nSociety of Civil Engineers, the American Council of Engineering \nCompanies--and the list goes on. These people understand how badly we \nneed these highway dollars. Anybody who thinks the $284 billion that we \nwere able to get to bring this bill to the floor is adequate has not \ngone home and listened to the people.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BOND. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. INHOFE. This has been a very good debate and lively debate, and \nyou both adequately confused me. I think that we should maybe draw this \nto an end. In a moment I would like to make a unanimous consent request \nthat would limit the debate on the amendment. I have been checking with \nyou individually. So I ask I be recognized at the conclusion of the \nSenator's remarks and any remarks the Senator from Virginia may have \nfor that request.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I certainly have no objection. How might \nwe best accommodate the managers of the bill? A few more minutes on my \nside, a few more minutes I presume from my colleague, and we would be--\n  Mr. INHOFE. I was going to propound a UC that you have 3 additional \nminutes, the Senator from Missouri has 3 additional minutes, and \nSenator Jeffords 2 additional minutes, if that is all right.\n  Mr. BOND. Do you want 2?\n  Mr. INHOFE. No, I don't want 2. I already had my 2.\n  Mr. BOND. Go ahead, please.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Thank you. So if there is no objection--\n  Mr. WARNER. Reserving the right to object, I wonder if you would ask \nthat I be recognized at the conclusion of the debate for purposes of \nmaking a tabling motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Let me go ahead and put this in order, then.\n\n\n                           Order Of Procedure\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 8 minutes \nremaining for debate prior to a vote in relation to the Bond amendment \nNo. 592, with Senator Warner in control of 3 minutes, Senator Bond in \ncontrol of 3 minutes, Senator Jeffords in control of 2 minutes, and \nthat Senator Warner would be recognized to make a tabling motion; \nprovided further, that following that debate, the Senate proceed to a \nvote in relation to the amendment, with no amendment in order to the \namendment prior to the vote--\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the purpose of my recognition is to move \nto table. Is that clearly understood?\n  Mr. BOND. Yes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Yes, it is clearly understood. Let me finish here.\n  Further, that following that vote, the Senate proceed to executive \nsession for the consideration en bloc of Calendar No. 67, Calendar No. \n68; further, that there then be 30 minutes equally divided between the \nchairman and ranking member or their designees; provided further, that \nfollowing that debate the Senate return to legislative session and the \nvotes occur on the confirmation of the two nominations at a time \ndetermined by the majority leader, after consultation with the Democrat \nleader, and that following those votes the President be notified of the \nSenate's action, and the Senate resume legislative session.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection was heard to unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  Is there objection?\n  Mr. WARNER. No. I withdraw any objection. I thank the Presiding \nOfficer. And I just might add by way of courtesy to the Senators, they \ncan expect a rollcall vote within the next 10 minutes or so. Would that \nnot be correct?\n  Mr. INHOFE. That would be correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S4474]]\n\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. To conclude my opening comments, I would note that the \nadministration, in its statement of policy, says: The inclusion of a \nmandatory 2-percent set-aside from the STP program to support a highway \nstorm water mitigation program is opposed. Storm water discharge \nmitigation costs are already eligible under STP.\n  I very much appreciate the assistance of the chairman of the \ncommittee, Senator Inhofe, who supports my amendment and spoke \neloquently earlier on it.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time and now turn the \nfloor over to----\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  You have just advised the Senate that the administration has taken a \nposition. I wish to add, is that the current AP or the one that was \ngiven last year?\n  Mr. BOND. April 26, 2005.\n  Mr. WARNER. Fine.\n  Mr. BOND. You may find it at the top of page 2.\n  Mr. WARNER. I accept the proffer.\n  Mr. President, while the Senator is on his feet, I say to the \nSenator, you say that this mandate is going to take some money from the \nbill. I have added up a number of mandates that our committee has put \ninto this bill which are funded out of highways. Two of them, I commend \nyou for. One is the NHS connecters--that is connecting some of our \nlocal systems to the interstate--which are valid. That is $900 million. \nSafe roads and paths to schools--that is a mandate. I commend you for \nthat. That is $312 million. And Railroad diversion of highway funds, \n$893 million. It goes on and on.\n  I have to tell you, I think this is a well-crafted bill. It has my \nsupport. The chairman knows that. But, please, do not point the finger \nto me as if I am the only one who put a mandate in to help the little \nfellows. They are in here, plenty of them.\n  Thank you for your smile. That is all I wish to say. You agree with \nme.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Bond \namendment.\n  This section provides much-needed assistance to our States and local \ncommunities to deal with the impacts of highway storm water discharges.\n  I urge my colleagues to continue their support for this vital program \nwhich the full Senate adopted in the 108th Congress.\n  My colleague from Missouri argues that this provision takes money \naway from State highway departments.\n  That is not the case.\n  This provision simply ensures that of the funds provided to State \nhighway departments, an extremely small percentage, 2 percent, will be \nspent on storm water problems caused by Federal aid highways.\n  Who will benefit?\n  Local communities will benefit. That is why the U.S. Conference of \nMayors is opposed to the Bond amendment.\n  Without the funds set aside by the storm water program in the highway \nbill, local communities will be left holding the bill for compliance \nwith storm water regulations in areas where Federal aid highways \ncontribute to storm water pollution.\n  Our Nation's wildlife will benefit.\n  One of this section's greatest supporters is Trout Unlimited.\n  They recognize that storm water runoff presents a huge risk to fish \npopulations all across the Nation.\n  Other groups opposed to the Bond amendment include the League of \nConservation Voters.\n  A vote against the Bond amendment is a vote for clean water.\n  A vote against the Bond amendment is a vote for local communities.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the Bond amendment.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to point out that as Senators come \ndown to vote, I will put this sheet down for their examination. It \nshows the current allocation of aggregate Surface Transportation \nProgram funds to their respective States, followed by a column which \nindicates the amount of money that the current markup with the Warner \nprovision in it takes for the storm water. And then in the right-hand \ncolumn is what their States owe under the EPA mandate to clean up \nwater.\n  You will find that I offset by just a small percentage the enormous \nobligation each Senator's State has with regard to the EPA-mandated \ncleanup of the water.\n  I thank the Chair and thank my colleagues for a very good debate. I \nhope we have fairly and adequately framed it for all Senators.\n  I move to table Bond amendment No. 592, and I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri has 2 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. WARNER. I will withhold.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues.\n  This particular mandate of the good Senator from Virginia is one that \nI don't like. He put in another mandate to increase funding for \nmetropolitan planning organizations. If we could pass a Clear Skies \nbill, we wouldn't need to waste all that time on planning activities \nbecause we would clean up our air with a heavy restriction on \nutilities. That is a debate for another time. But just because there \nare too many mandates in this bill already does not justify keeping \n$900 million in State budgets out of transportation needs and putting \nit into storm water.\n  Don't forget, as we have said, the States now can spend up to 20 \npercent of their STP and the National Highway System money on storm \nwater cleanups. Granted, there are tremendous needs for cleaning up the \nwater, wastewater and drinking water. We need to address those. I wish \nwe could address them more generously in the water cleanup bills. But \nthis is taking money away from the lifeblood of transportation \nlifesaving highway construction that we need in our States.\n  Our mayors--in Missouri, the ones I have talked to--and community \nleaders are very strongly in favor of it. I guess the good Senator and \nI will have dueling charts showing how much money is set aside from the \nState budgets. We know the amounts set aside in the State budgets pale \nby comparison to the water needs, but the needs for highways go far \nbeyond that in our States. I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose the \nmotion to table because we need better, safer transportation to meet \nthe goals of SAFETEA.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I simply wish to reply that the amendment \nthat is in the bill provides jobs. The same construction worker who is \non the project building the new road comes down and repairs the old \nroad. It requires concrete and asphalt to repair the old road, to \ndivert the water. So it is highway construction. It is jobs. There is \nno digression of the funds except to provide a safety measure.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, all of the labor organizations, the State \nhighway officials, all of the groups that provide those funds strongly \nsupport my amendment and would oppose the motion to table of the \nSenator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, those organizations have been misinformed.\n  I move to table the Bond amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 51, nays 49, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 113 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--51\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Clinton\n     Coleman\n     Corzine\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Ensign\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     McCain\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Obama\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Smith\n     Stabenow\n     Warner\n     Wyden\n\n[[Page S4475]]\n\n\n\n                                NAYS--49\n\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Burr\n     Byrd\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Enzi\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. SARBANES.

Conrad, Jr., of \nNorth Carolina, to be United States District Judge for the Western \nDistrict of North Carolina.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: Are we now taking \nup the nominations of Robert J. Conrad and James C. Dever to be U.S. \ndistrict judges in North Carolina?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I am glad to hear that because I couldn't hear the clerk \nreport it.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to report that the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee has recommended to the full Senate on reports filed that \nRobert J. Conrad, Jr., should become U.S. district court judge for the \nWestern District of North Carolina. Mr. Conrad comes to this position \nwith a very distinguished record. He is a former U.S. attorney for \nNorth Carolina. As assistant U.S. attorney, he made a name for himself \nin the prosecution of terrorism financing cases and campaign finance. \nAttorney General Ashcroft named Mr. Conrad to the Advisory Committee on \nTerrorism Financing, and Mr. Conrad testified before the Judiciary \nCommittee on that subject. He was instrumental in prosecuting \nsupporters of the Hezbollah terrorist cell in North Carolina in a very \nhighly celebrated case.\n  Prior to his appointment as U.S. attorney, he served as an assistant \nU.S. attorney for 12 years. I can tell you, with some experience in \nthat kind of position, you really learn a lot as assistant prosecuting \nattorney. Sometimes I am asked what is the best job I ever had, Senator \nor district attorney, and I say assistant district attorney. That is \nwhere there is a great deal of experience.\n  He has had bipartisan support from Democrats. The North Carolina \nattorney general, Roy Cooper, and former Attorney General Janet Reno \npraised him very highly.\n  I would now like to make a comment about the other nominee, James C. \nDever, III, who has been recommended by the Judiciary Committee to be \nthe U.S. district court judge for the Eastern District of North \nCarolina. Mr. Dever is a U.S. magistrate judge in the Eastern District. \nHe comes to this position as a highly respected attorney, a magistrate \njudge, recommended to be promoted to the district court by the \nbipartisan Merit Selection Panel of district court judges of the \nEastern District. He has a very distinguished academic record. He \nserved in the Air Force for 4 years, from 1988 to 1992. He was a member \nof the Air Force General Counsel's Honors Program. He served with great \ndistinction. He has been an adjunct professor at the Norman Adrian \nWiggins School of Law at Campbell University since 1997. He clerked for \nJudge Clifford Wallace on the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. \nHe is rated in the highest category among lawyers by Martindale-\nHubbell. I recommend that my colleagues support both of these \nmeritorious nominees, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, these confirmations will be the 207th and \n208th of 218 nominees brought before the full Senate for a vote to be \nconfirmed. The Senate will have confirmed four more lifetime \nappointments to the Federal courts this year. With the year being \nalmost one-third concluded, the Republican majority is gaining on the \npace it set in 1999 when Senate Republicans allowed President Clinton \nto appoint only 17 district court judges and not a single nominee to \nthe circuit courts that entire session.\n  These 208 judicial confirmations mean that even with the slow start \nthis year because the President has refused to nominate consensus \nnominees, or anyone for 29 judicial vacancies, we are currently within \n37 confirmations of the 6-year total achieved under the Senate \nRepublican majority during the Clinton administration. That means if \nthe Senate confirms another dozen judges this year and 30 next year, we \nwill have equaled the total of which Senate Republicans were so proud \nduring the Clinton years. The year I chaired the Judiciary Committee, \nthe Senate confirmed 72 of President Bush's nominees. If the President \nand Senate Republicans would work with us rather than foment conflict \nand confrontation, we could easily surpass their record.\n  Of the 45 judicial vacancies that will remain after these \nconfirmations, President Bush has not even sent nominees for 29 of \nthose vacancies. I have been encouraging the Bush administration to \nwork with Senators to identify qualified and consensus judicial \nnominees. The Democratic leader and I sent the President a letter in \nthis regard on April 5, but we have received no response. Indeed, to \ndate the President has only sent the Senate one new judicial nominee \nall year.\n  Despite the efforts of the Senate Republicans to create a crisis, the \ntruth is that in President Bush's first term, the 204 judges confirmed \nwere more than were confirmed in either of President Clinton two terms, \nmore than during the term of this President's father,\n\n[[Page S4478]]\n\nand more than in Ronald Reagan's first term when he was being assisted \nby a Republican majority in the Senate. By last December, we had \nreduced judicial vacancies from the 110 vacancies I inherited in the \nsummer of 2001 to the lowest level, lowest rate and lowest number in \ndecades, since Ronald Reagan was in office.\n  The two district court nominees being confirmed today, Robert Conrad \nand James Dever, are nominees who have raised concerns. When they were \nfirst nominated their home-State Senator had serious questions about \nthem. A home-State Senator's views on a Federal court nominee has a \nlong history of importance in the Senate. The Constitution says we \nshould give the President advice on judicial appointments, and the \nviews of home-State Senators have been very important. Candidly, I wish \nthe White House had heeded Senator Edwards' advice and reconsidered \nthese nominations.\n  After reading some of Mr. Conrad's more inflammatory writings, I do \nnot wonder at Senator Edwards' objections. In particular, I am \nconcerned about what some of the things he has written say about his \nability to be a fair judge, and to give all who come before him a fair \nhearing. Listen to what he wrote about Sister Helen Prejean, one of the \nbravest and most caring people I have ever met. He calls her book, \n``Dead Man Walking,'' ``liberal drivel,'' and shows nothing but \ncontempt for her compassionate work with condemned prisoners. The \nrhetoric he uses is heated, and his bias for the death penalty is \nclear. Will any defendant in a capital case who comes before a Judge \nConrad feel that they will get a fair hearing from him? Will he feel \nthat a Judge Conrad can put aside personal prejudices and \npreconceptions? I hope so.\n\n  Another example is the not-too-subtly titled article, ``Planned \nParenthood, A Radical, Pro-Abortion Fringe Group.'' Mr. Conrad's view \nof the well-respected family planning organization is that it is a \n``most radical legal advocate of unfettered abortion on demand,'' and \nargues they do nothing to reduce teen pregnancy. The Planned Parenthood \norganization that I know, both in Vermont and nationally, works hard to \nreduce crisis pregnancies and to preserve families' rights to plan \ntheir own futures. His statements make me wonder whether any person \ngoing before a Judge Conrad in a case involving reproductive rights, or \nindeed any issue related to personal privacy, will feel their arguments \nhave been fairly heard. Will he be able to follow the law as written? \nAgain, for the sake of future litigants and the independence of our \njudiciary, I hope so.\n  I have similar concerns about Judge Dever. I see why Senator Edwards \nwanted better consultation on these district court nominees. Judge \nDever's only two Supreme Court briefs argued against State legislative \nredistricting action designed to comply with the Voting Rights Act of \n1965. When I asked Judge Dever to give me some assurance that he would \nbe impartial when called upon to hear a redistricting case, he could \nonly state that he believed he would be fair.\n  Much of Judge Dever's experience is in the area of representing \nRepublican clients. While employed at a law firm, he provided legal \nservices to several Republican campaigns and has been listed on the \nRepublican National Lawyers Association webpage as an affiliated \nlawyer. I would like to believe that Judge Dever was nominated based on \nhis own merits, and that his personal relationships will not affect his \nability to rule impartially if he is confirmed. I have concerns.\n  I take seriously the views and support of the current North Carolina \nSenators. I hope that their support of these nominees is justified and \nthat these nominees will serve in accordance with their oath to treat \nall who come before them fairly.\n  Today, again, Senate Democrats are demonstrating their willingness to \nwork with the President and Senate Republicans.\n  I regret that in spite of all of our actions, the Republican majority \nseems intent on forcing a confrontation and breaking the Senate Rules \nin order to change them. The majority leader has apparently cast his \nlot with those who would alter the role of the Senate as a check and a \nbalance on the choices of a powerful President. The Federal judiciary \nshould not become an extension of the executive or a wholly-owned \nsubsidiary of his political party.\n  Today, Republicans are threatening to take away one of the few \nremaining checks on the power of the executive branch by their use of \nwhat has become knows as the nuclear option. This assault on our \ntradition of checks and balances and on the protection of minority \nrights in the Senate and in our democracy should be abandoned. \nEliminating the filibuster by the nuclear option would destroy the \nConstitution's design of the Senate as an effective check on the \nExecutive. The elimination of the filibuster would reduce any incentive \nfor a President to consult with home-state Senators or seek the advice \nof the Senate on lifetime appointments to the Federal judiciary. It is \na leap not only toward one-party rule but to an unchecked executive.\n  Rather than blowing up the Senate, let us honor the constitutional \ndesign of our system of checks and balances and work together to fill \njudicial vacancies with consensus nominees. The nuclear option is \nunnecessary. What is needed is a return to consultation and for the \nWhite House to recognize and respect the role of the Senate \nappointments process.\n  The American people have begun to see this threatened partisan power \ngrab for what it is and to realize that the threat and the potential \nharm are aimed at our democracy, at an independent and strong Federal \njudiciary and, ultimately, at their rights and freedoms. As we proceed \nto confirm two more lifetime appointments to the Federal courts, I urge \nSenate Republicans to reconsider and not to head down the destructive \npath represented by the nuclear option.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield the remainder of time on this side to the \nSenators from North Carolina, Senator Dole and Senator Burr, to be \ndivided equally.\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, it is my privilege to support Jim Dever for \na seat on the U.S. district court in Eastern North Carolina. This seat \nhas been vacant for 6 years and is considered a judicial emergency by \nthe Judicial Conference. In fact, a vote for Jim Dever will end the \nlongest district court vacancy in the United States. Jim Dever, who is \nan outstanding editor in chief of the Duke University law Journal, \nlives in Raleigh and currently serves as U.S. magistrate judge in the \nEastern District of North Carolina.\n  Raleigh, the State's capital and the district's largest city, is \nwithout a resident district court judge. Elevating Jim to the district \ncourt will end this problem. Not one objection has been raised about \nJim Dever's qualifications. He has broad bipartisan support. Robinson \nEverett, a Duke law professor and former Chief Judge of the Court of \nAppeals for the Armed Forces, describes Jim Dever as having ``all the \nrequisite qualities.'' ``He will be a `superb jurist.'''\n  I am also delighted to support Bob Conrad, nominated in April 2003, \nto be U.S. district judge for the Western District of North Carolina. \nBob is sorely needed. As our courts confront the ramifications of the \nSupreme Court's recent decision on the Federal minimum sentence \nguidelines, it is reasonable to expect we will have even higher \ncaseloads and need more judges to deal with them.\n  Bob Conrad is known for his prosecution of the cigarette smuggling \nring funding the terrorist group Hezbollah, and in 1999, Bob Conrad was \nappointed by then-Attorney General Janet Reno to head the U.S. Justice \nDepartment's investigation into campaign fundraising abuses.\n  Bob is a graduate of Clemson and the University of Virginia Law \nSchool. He served as a Federal prosecutor in Charlotte, starting in \n1989. From 2001 until 2004, he was the U.S. attorney for the Western \nDistrict of North Carolina. Currently he is in private practice at one \nof the largest law firms in the world as a partner in its Charlotte \noffice.\n  Both of these North Carolina nominees come with tremendous \ncredentials, and it is my privilege to give them my strong support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I also rise in support of two fine and \nhighly qualified individuals to be confirmed to the\n\n[[Page S4479]]\n\nFederal bench, Robert Conrad to be a U.S. District Court Judge for the \nWestern District of North Carolina and James Dever to be U.S. District \nCourt Judge for the Eastern District of North Carolina.\n  Bob Conrad was nominated by the President on April 28, 2003. Bob \nConrad is now a partner at the law firm of Mayer, Brown, Rowe, and Maw \nin Charlotte, North Carolina. He has served as a U.S. Attorney for the \nWestern District of North Carolina. He is a graduate of Clemson \nUniversity and the University of Virginia Law School.\n  Bob Conrad possesses the qualities necessary to serve as a U.S. \nDistrict Court Judge. He is fairminded, evenhanded, and treats all with \nrespect. He has repeatedly demonstrated a commitment to public service \nand a spirit of impartiality and cooperation. Bob is also a devoted \nhusband to his wife Ann, and he is a loving father to his five \nchildren.\n  Today, we consider his nomination for the Western District Court \njudgeship for the great State of North Carolina. I believe Bob Conrad's \nintegrity, compassion, and intelligence have earned him strong \nbipartisan support, and he will again serve ably as a representative of \nour country. I am pleased that almost 2 years since his nomination, Bob \nConrad will be confirmed by the Senate.\n  President Bush has also nominated James Dever to be U.S. District \nCourt Judge for the Eastern District of North Carolina on May 22, 2002. \nAfter almost 3 years, James Dever's nomination is now reaching the \nfloor for a vote. He served as U.S. Magistrate Judge on the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the Eastern District for North Carolina since 2004. \nPrior to that, the judge was a member of the Raleigh law firm of Maupin \nTaylor, and Judge Dever graduated with high honors from Notre Dame, \nwhere he attended on a 4-year ROTC scholarship. Judge Dever also \ngraduated with high honors from Duke University Law School, where he \nwas editor and chief of the Duke Law Journal. Judge Dever also served \nhis country in the U.S. Air Force.\n  The Eastern District post to which Judge Dever has been nominated is \nthe longest district court vacancy in the nation. In fact, it has been \nvacant since 1997. In 1999, the Administrative Office of the Courts \ndeclared the district as a judicial emergency, and it has been \ncategorized that way for the last 6 years.\n  For some time, the State of North Carolina has felt the absence of \nU.S. District Court Judges. However, the Eastern District in \nparticular, which comprises almost half of the counties in North \nCarolina and has over 3 million people, has arguably suffered the most.\n  James Dever will bring to this post the qualities and character that \nwill continue to make North Carolinians proud of him. James Dever is \nhighly regarded by his colleagues and he has a record of public \nservice. He is a bright, accomplished individual with a proven record. \nHis supportive family includes his loving wife Amy and their three \nchildren.\n\n  Today I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of these two esteemed \nattorneys. North Carolina, and the United States as a whole, will \nbenefit substantially from the confirmation of these well-respected men \nto the Federal bench.\n  I yield back all time and call for the question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If all time is yielded back, the question is, \nWill the Senate advise and consent to the nominations en bloc of James \nC. Dever, III, to be United States District Judge for the Eastern \nDistrict of North Carolina, and of Robert J. Conrad, Jr., to be United \nStates District Judge for the Western District of North Carolina.\n  The nominations were confirmed, en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The President will be immediately notified of \nthe Senate's action.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/28/senate-section/article/S4479-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4479]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to discuss a matter of grave \nimportance to our economy and national security. The issue is energy \npolicy and what it will take to put us on a path toward energy \ndiversification and away from our overdependence on foreign oil.\n  Tonight we will hear from the President about how he plans to lower \ngas prices. In the State of Washington we have seen a rise of almost 50 \ncents a gallon in 1 year. I look forward to hearing what the President \nhas to say about lowering those gas prices. I do not believe his plan \nto drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge will help make any \ndifference in the prices in the near term.\n  I will address what is a broader energy debate this Senate is about \nto start. Energy is the lifeblood of our economy. It keeps our cars \nrunning, our companies competitive, our citizens safe, and our Nation \nsecure. It is the future source of job growth for America.\n  The House has passed an energy bill and the Senate will start shortly \non its own plan. We need to tell America where we are going on this \nimportant journey to set about an energy policy in America that we can \nbe proud of.\n  We are at a critical juncture. The pain being felt at the gas pump by \nAmericans is a wake-up call to all of us that we need to take action. \nNow is the moment our Nation must make a conscious choice to tackle the \nchallenges ahead in a straightforward and serious manner, and get to \nthe heart of what is a very enormous problem.\n  What our country needs is an energy policy that bets on American \ningenuity and investment rather than gambling our future on the good \nwill of the Saudi Royal Family or the OPEC cartel. There is no doubt in \nmy mind, and history shows this, when this Nation devotes its \ntremendous resources and innovative spirit to confronting a threat such \nas that posed by the high cost of energy and overdependence on foreign \nsupply, we can succeed. History has shown in our country, we have made \nsignificant shifts in investment when our national goals were set in \nthe right direction.\n  Americans are familiar with the ambitious goals set by President John \nF. Kennedy when he challenged this Nation to put a man on the moon \nwithin a decade. But it was not just rhetoric. President Kennedy \ntripled the budget for the space program between 1961 and 1962. He also \nasked us to double the number of scientists and engineers working on \nthe project over a 5-year period. President Kennedy recognized the \nimportance of this investment and America won an international race to \nput a man on the moon.\n  A less recounted story, but nonetheless significant to our country's \nhistory, was the shift in gears this country made when we embarked on \nthe Manhattan Project. In 1942, President Franklin Roosevelt authorized \n$85 million for what would become the Manhattan Project. Within 2 \nyears, our entire national budget for atomic research grew from $6,000 \nto $85 million. In the midst of World War II, the President had decided \nit was in our Nation's\n\n[[Page S4480]]\n\nstrategic interest to make this investment. Three years later, the \nManhattan Project ushered in the nuclear age and the United States won \nthe race to become a superpower. The Manhattan Project changed the \ncourse of history. That $2 billion investment also has influenced \ndomestic and international policy ever since that time.\n  A little less dramatic but no less important for consumers and \nbusinesses across America, there is another example of how this country \nshifted gears and focused on investment and energy policy. In the 1970s \nwe woke up to the fact that our country was defending, in support of, \nthe only democracy in the Middle East. As a result, we ended up with an \nOPEC oil embargo. Our economy was stalled and we waited in long gas \nlines to fill up our tanks.\n  What did Congress do during that crisis? Among many things, we passed \nthe Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 which made our cars more \nefficient. In 1978, we passed the Public Utility Regulatory Policy Act \nwhich led to diversifying our source of electricity generation by \nlowering the barriers for new generation of cleaner and more efficient \npower.\n  In the mid-1970s, oil was used to generate electricity for homes and \nfuel for our economy; we got 20 percent of our Nation's electricity \nfrom oil. But because of our actions during the 1970s, being \naggressive, today oil is only 2 percent of our electricity portfolio. \nDuring this time, consumers also began making choices to switch from \nhome heating oil to other sources. In fact, since that time period, the \nnumber of homes that use home heating oil has dropped about 35 percent.\n  So we have seen in our history that we can take aggressive steps and \nshift our investments toward a new strategy. Certainly that is what we \nneed to do now to get this country moving toward a more independent \nenergy future. In other words, we showed the leadership that is lacking \ntoday in making the right investments.\n  We are in an international race because of the economics of oil and \nwhere our oil dependence is leading us. First, even if every last \ndeposit geologically present in the United States was tapped, the fact \nremains that the United States sits on 3 percent of the world's oil \nreserves. Today, the United States imports about 60 percent of its oil \nsupply. Dependence on oil means dependence on foreign sources of oil. \nIt is a geological and economic fact of life: We cannot drill our way \nto energy independence.\n  Where are the prices today? According to DOE's Energy Information \nAdministration, gas prices for this week have reached a national \naverage of $2.24. As I said, in my home State, that is a little higher \nat $2.48. What we understand is that gas prices for the future are also \ngoing to be high if we stay this course. The gas prices that have \nhovered about $50 a barrel for this year are up from about $30 a barrel \nin 2004. I don't know if any of my colleagues remember the 1990s, when \noil was $15 a barrel.\n  The real concern is, what is the economic outlook for oil prices in \nthe future? The World Economic Outlook Report issued earlier this month \nby the International Monetary Fund will have all my colleagues' \nattention. That is because it is projected that oil could spike to $100 \na barrel between now and 2030.\n\n  These prices are driven in part by a tripling of demand by China. As \nthe Chinese and Indian economies grow, so will their dependence on \npetroleum. And rising incomes in China mean they will own more \nautomobiles. According to that same report of the International \nMonetary Fund, China will be consuming 19 million barrels of oil a day \nin 2030, more than triple the amount it used last year, and almost as \nmuch as the United States uses today.\n  We know demand for oil is going to increase, and we know the cost is \ngoing to go up. In fact, a Wall Street firm, Goldman Sachs, predicted \nthe price of oil could reach $105 a barrel in the next few years and \nthat the energy markets could be in the early stages of a superspike \nperiod, where we could see prices fluctuate as we did in the 1970s, \nwhen at times they quadrupled. So this is a very important issue, \nsomething this body needs to address, not with a Band-Aid, but with a \nlong-term solution that will put our country on the right track.\n  If we do not think this is impacting other parts of our economy, \nparticularly on the trade front, the Department of Commerce recently, \nin its monthly report, said the U.S. trade deficit in February worsened \nto $61 billion, in part because of the surging oil prices. So it is \nimpacting our economy all around. But so long as this Nation fails to \nmake progress on an energy policy that acknowledges the reality of \ngeology and the international marketplace, we are jeopardizing our \neconomic future.\n  I cannot say I agree with the President's energy proposal and policy \ngoals. But I know he has said he knows this becomes a ``foreign tax on \nthe American dream.'' I do agree with that. The American people want to \nsee a different policy. They have not given the President high marks on \nhis energy proposal.\n  In an AP poll taken last week, more than 50 percent of people said if \ngas prices stay as high as they are in the next several months, it will \ncause financial hardship for them. It is already causing financial \nhardship in many parts of my State. In fact, 57 percent of people in \nthe same report said they have already cut back on other expenses to \ncope with rising gas prices.\n  Here is a telling figure: Sixty-two percent of the people say they \ndisapprove of the handling of our nation's energy policy. I believe \nthey mean they want to see a different approach. Mr. President, 87 \npercent of the American people say that conservation, fuel efficiency, \nand alternative energy sources are the best way to reduce America's \noverdependence on foreign oil. We need to listen to them and get an \nenergy policy that reflects that reality.\n  The American people know it is time to get serious. They know some of \nthe ideas we talk about here are the alternatives to our overdependence \non oil--investment in wind power, wave power, solar power, and the \ningenuity of American brainpower. Those ideas need to have their day in \nthe Senate, where we can talk about the issues of alternative energy \nand modernizing our transmission grid.\n  Well, I can tell you this, we are going to have some challenging \ntimes agreeing to some of the proposals that are being passed over by \nthe House of Representatives as they discuss an energy policy. Here in \nthe Senate, I am encouraged that the chairman of the Senate Energy \nCommittee, Senator Domenici, is actually reaching out to Members and \ntrying to discuss the formation of what will be a productive energy \ndebate and discussion, and a bipartisan effort that will merge these \nideas about where we need to go for the future into a bill. So I \nappreciate the chairman's efforts, as he has discussed with Members of \nboth the majority party and minority party some of the ideas the Senate \nshould be considering in an energy strategy.\n  But if we are going to make dramatic progress, we need to make sure \nthe President of the United States, who is endorsing the House proposal \nin his administrative statement of support, understands that proposal \nis a nonstarter. The American people want to see a real plan of \ndiversification, insofar as they think the House proposal has fallen \nshort. In fact, even the President's own economic advisers in the \nEnergy Information Administration have concluded the House Republican \nenergy plan will have a ``negligible'' impact on energy supply, energy \nprices, production, and imports--``negligible.'' In fact, the same \neconomists concluded their proposal will have a 0.1 percent--that is \nless than 1 percent--impact on oil consumption by 2025.\n  So, in other words, the House energy plan, which the President is \nendorsing, is like treading water. It is like standing still, while our \neconomy cannot stay afloat on these high gasoline prices, and while our \nbusinesses and consumers continue to be gouged.\n  Details of what is wrong with the President's plan ought to be front \nand center as we discuss our Senate proposal so as not to make the same \nmistakes and so we can move forward.\n  Because clearly, there is something wrong when we look at the \npriorities of the legislation the President has endorsed. For example, \nthis proposal continues to provide subsidies in the wrong direction. \nLast year, this body rejected a proposal that would have given 60 \npercent of the tax incentives to the traditional industries; that is,\n\n[[Page S4481]]\n\noil and gas. You would think turning that proposal down might have sent \na message. But, instead, our colleagues in the other body now give 90 \npercent of the tax incentives to the same traditional industries and \ndevote only 6 percent to new technologies.\n  If the President is serious about getting a proposal before August, \nhe should start by making clear his opposition to a waiver, letting oil \ncompanies off the hook for groundwater-polluting chemicals such as \nMTBE. I do not believe granting immunity to polluters for groundwater \ncleanup costs and saying States should pay for it has a single thing to \ndo with getting an energy policy that will put America on the right \ntrack.\n\n  Americans want to know our energy policy is about the common \ninterest, not special interest. They want to know we are going to get a \nbill that helps us diversify off of our foreign sources of energy.\n  There are many other things the President's plan endorses that I \nthink are dead wrong, and we are going to have plenty of time to talk \nabout them. But I would mention them briefly.\n  For example, this current proposal fails to recognize how our country \nhas been gouged by high energy costs from companies such as Enron. It \ndoes nothing to hold the line against what I call the latter-day Ken \nLays, and would leave future Enrons with the opportunity to steal from \nconsumers. What we need is a tough bill in relation to market \nmanipulation that includes making sure utilities that continue to be \nsued by Enron are not the deep pockets for their extreme market \nmanipulation and trading practices that the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission has failed to adequately deal with.\n  The President's endorsed energy plan also rolls back dozens of \nenvironmental rules and laws that were put in place to protect \nAmericans' public health and safety. Many of them were put in by \nprevious Republican administrations. So we are going to have lots of \ntime to discuss this energy plan and proposal when we return and the \nSenate Energy Committee starts discussing this proposal. But because \ngas prices are still high, and because we still need to address where \nwe are going as a country, I want to make sure this Senator stands firm \non the fact that we cannot continue to tread water or stay in the same \nplace. We need to take the same aggressive actions previous \nadministrations did, as we changed our investment strategy, as we put \nthe Nation on call for an emergent need, and moved forward on a policy.\n  That is what I call progress. The Europeans already understand this. \nThat is why they are making a significant investment in renewable \nenergy technology. The Japanese understand this. That is why their \nautomakers are making big investments and cornering the market on fuel \nefficiency technologies and vehicles. And even China understands this \nbecause they have put in place higher fuel efficiency standards than in \nthe United States. What we need to do is recognize the energy future by \nplanning for it, not with half-baked policies that dither around the \nmargins of the problem but with real leadership on an energy economy of \nthe future.\n  I hope that tonight the President will address the American people \nand tell us what his real plan is to lower gas prices in the future, to \ngive America an independence from our overdependence on foreign oil. I \nhope he will give this country the kind of boost that previous \nadministrations have, by leading the way with new technology \ninvestments and a vision of the future that will give our country the \nnational and economic security it deserves. I think he will find that \nthere are many Americans waiting to hear that plan--there are farmers, \nenvironmentalists, businesspeople, certainly a number of us in the \nSenate and, I would say to the President, even some of the neocons of \nprevious administrations who are ready to hear an energy strategy that \ngets us off of our overdependence on foreign oil. I look forward to \nthose comments.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/28/senate-section/article/S4481-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4481-S4527]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2006--CONFERENCE \n                                 REPORT\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nnotwithstanding the receipt of the House message and having the Senate \npapers at the desk, the Senate begin consideration of the conference \nreport to accompany the budget resolution; provided further that the \ntime from now until the arrival of the ranking member be under the \ncontrol of the chairman; provided further that when the ranking member \narrives, he be recognized to be in control of a like amount of time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thune). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, this order allows us to start opening \nstatements on the budget. Senator Conrad should be available around 6 \no'clock this evening, and his side will control the time after he \narrives, which will be commensurate with the time we control, which I \npresume will be approximately an hour that we will use now until 6 \no'clock.\n  Mr. President, we are now turning to the budget of the United States, \nwhich is pending in the House and being debated in the House. This \nobviously is a major item for us as a Congress. It is very hard to take \nthe position that a government that spends $2.6 trillion should not \nhave an outline as to how it is going to spend that money, should not \nhave a proposal and a policy for spending that money. That is why a \nbudget is important.\n  A budget doesn't get into the specifics of how the dollars are spent, \nbut it does set out a very substantial and important blueprint as to \nhow those dollars will be spent and what the policies are that will \naffect spending and taxes as we move into the future.\n  The budget that we bring today is a result of a lot of hard work. I \nwant to especially thank my colleague from North Dakota, the Democratic \nranking member of the committee, and his staff, who have been extremely \ncourteous and extraordinarily professional in the way they have \napproached the process. Senator Conrad is someone I have enjoyed \nworking with very much. We disagree, obviously, but the disagreements \nhave been on policy, and certainly there has been nothing but a \nprofessional, cordial, and friendly relationship between us.\n  I also thank the majority leader and the assistant majority leader, \nSenator Frist and Senator McConnell, for their extraordinary effort. I \nespecially thank members of my committee, all of whom have been very \nmuch engaged and who have been very involved in developing the budget.\n  In addition, I specifically thank Senator Smith from Oregon, who has \nbeen a critical player in developing what is one of the core issues of \nthis budget, which I will get into in a few minutes.\n  Of course, I especially thank the staffs, both the majority staff and \nminority staff, and especially the staff on our side, led by Scott \nGudes, and our colleagues across the aisle in the House who worked so \nhard to get us to this point.\n  The budget we are bringing forward today is the result of what I \nconsider to be some serious public policy problems we confront as a \nnation, and they involve the amount of spending the Federal Government \nis doing in relationship to revenues, and specifically the rate of \ngrowth of our spending and the fact that we are confronting very \nsignificant deficits not only in the short term but in the long term.\n  I want to go through a few charts to explain the parameters of the \nproblem. I think it is critical that people understand that and \nunderstand how this budget was developed. We received testimony in the \ncommittee from the Comptroller General of the United States that there \nare on the books today obligations of the Federal Government that \nexceed projected revenues of the Federal Government amounting to \napproximately $44 trillion. Now, a trillion dollars is an \nincomprehensible amount of money for anybody to understand. I will try \nto\n\n[[Page S4482]]\n\nput it into context. This means we already have obligations that we \nhave committed to as a government that we have not figured out how we \nare going to pay for, which in their total add up to $44 trillion, \nwhich amount of money compared, for example, to all of the taxes \ncollected by the United States since we became a nation--all of the \ntaxes collected during that time, over 200 years, total $38 trillion. \nSo we actually have on the books more in obligation than we have \ncollected in taxes in the history of the Nation.\n  To try to put it in another context, if you take all the net worth of \neverybody in this country--everybody's car, house, savings account, \nstock, every asset that everybody has in this country--and add it all \ntogether, it adds up to about $47 trillion.\n  This chart reflects the problem. The chart here is $44 trillion in \noutstanding obligations of the Federal Government. Over here we have \nthe present net worth of the United States, which is $47 trillion. The \namount collected since the beginning of the country is $38 trillion. \nThe larger part of the chart reflects $44 billion, calculated on the \nactuarial life of these programs. The larger part of the chart is what \nthe cost would be if you projected these programs out into infinity, \nwhich would be 100 years, which is about $84 trillion.\n  So you can see that we are confronting a massive fiscal problem as a \nnation. The effects of this problem will be that somebody is going to \nhave to pay this bill. Our generation is running up the bill and we are \npassing it on to our children, and our children will have to bear a \nhuge cost in order to pay off this $44 trillion in debt that we have \nadded up. To pay that off, basically, their quality of life is going to \nhave to be reduced, unless we get started on addressing this problem \nnow.\n  Where does the $44 trillion come from? What are the obligations that \ncreated this huge number? This chart reflects it. It is entirely almost \nwhat is known as entitlements, or mandatory spending; it is the orange \nline. If you look at the mandatory spending, these are programs on the \nbooks that say, if you are a citizen and you have certain physical or \ndemographic or income characteristics, you have a right to payment by \nthe Federal Government. The majority of these entitlements, the \nmandatory spending is Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. These \nthree items make up the vast majority of the cost of the $44 trillion, \nwhich is unpaid for. In fact, Medicare and Medicaid--the health care \nitems of those three entitlements--represents about $27 trillion of the \ntotal of $44 trillion--$27 trillion of unfunded liabilities. That means \nafter taking all of the taxes you pay, your HI tax--the hospital tax \nwhich you pay out of your payroll every week--there is still a debt, an \nobligation on top of those taxes of $27 trillion--a huge amount of \nmoney.\n  Well, now, some would represent that if we raise taxes, we can solve \nthis problem. But we cannot. I want to explain why and the next chart \ndoes that.\n  Historically, the Federal Government has spent about 20 percent of \nthe gross national product. That is what we spend as a Federal \nGovernment. We take the gross national product--20 percent of it--and \nspend it to govern. That has been in our history for quite a while, \nsince the 1960 period. That is the blue line that runs across the \nchart. If you take the top three--Social Security, Medicare and \nMedicaid--just the cost of that, as projected out into the future, you \nwill see that by about 2028, 2031--depending on what happens around \nhere--the cost of those three programs to pay the benefits that have \nbeen committed under those three programs will exceed 20 percent of the \ngross national product.\n\n  What is the practical effect of that? It is that if that were allowed \nto occur, you would have no money available to pay for national \ndefense, education, environmental protection, the building of roads, or \nfor anything other than those three programs. It gets worse. The line \nkeeps going straight up--this is where the $44 trillion comes in--as \nthose programs continue to demand more and more in order to support \nthem because of the obligations that are on the books. So you can raise \ntaxes almost endlessly and never catch up with the spending that we \nhave on the books.\n  That is the point. You cannot tax your way out of this problem. You \nsimply cannot do it. You have to address these major programs and try \nto control their rate of growth so they are affordable, while still \nmaintaining a benefit structure that is fair, especially to low-income \nAmericans. If you don't do it, the practical effect would be that you \nwill have to double the taxes on our children in the area of \nwithholding in order to keep up with these costs during the period 2020 \nto 2040. That would mean our children, instead of being able to buy a \nhouse, a car, expand their education, or send their kids to college, \nthey will have to pay a radically increased tax burden in order to \nsupport our generation. What is causing this huge explosion in costs? \nIt is the fact that the baby boom generation is so large, the \ndemographic shift is so huge, when our generation starts to retire \nbecause we go from a generation that has changed the culture of America \nthroughout our lifetime to when we retire we will change the dynamics \nof the demand on the Federal Government; we shift that so radically \nthat we put all these new costs on our children and our children's \nchildren to support our generation when we retire.\n  People have heard me say this before. These retirement systems--\nMedicare, Medicaid, Social Security--were structured on the concept \nthat there would always be a pyramid, many more people paying into the \nsystem than taking out. In 1950, 16 people were paying into the system \nfor every one person that was taking out. That is the pyramid concept, \nthe genius of Franklin Roosevelt. Today, there are 3\\1/2\\ people paying \ninto the system, and it is still affordable. But as we head into this \nnext century and as this huge baby boom generation of which I am a \nmember retires, there will only be two people paying into the system \nfor every one person taking out. So we go from a pyramid to a \nrectangle, and you simply cannot support the system as it is \nstructured.\n  The taxes on our children will far exceed their capacity to pay them \nin order to support the benefit structure. So how do we address this? \nWell, one way is to bury our heads in the sand and say it is not a \nproblem and hope our children can handle the tax burden increase. But \nthat is not acceptable. As leaders and as people charged with the \nresponsibility of public policy in this country, we need to get ahead \nof this issue before we get to the problem. And that is where this \nbudget comes into play.\n\n  The President sent us a budget which for the first time in 7 years \nstepped on the sacred ground of trying to address the entitlement costs \nof the Federal Government. Independent of the budget, of course, he has \ntried to address the Social Security issue. By law, the Budget \nCommittee is not allowed to address Social Security. So that one is \ntaken off the table for us as a committee. But we do have the capacity \nas a Budget Committee to step forward and try to do something about the \nissue of entitlements beyond Social Security, and that is what we are \ngoing to try to do in this budget. We are going to try to begin the \nprocess of relieving the pressure that is going to be put on the next \ngeneration.\n  This budget does three basic things. In the short term, it reduces \nthe deficit in half over 4 years. It does this by aggressively \ncontrolling the rate of growth of discretionary spending that is \nnondefense. Specifically, we freeze it for 3 years. That is a very \naggressive position. Nondefense discretionary spending is frozen for 3 \nyears. But more importantly, we reestablish enforcement mechanisms \nknown as spending caps. Members can come to the floor, and if a bill \nexceeds that freeze, they can make a point of order against that bill, \nand it will take 60 votes in the Senate to pass that bill. That is an \nimportant change, a very important change--not a change but a \nreinstitution of budget discipline.\n  What happened? Why don't we have caps today? We do, but they are very \nmuch at the margin. The problem is that because we did not pass a \nbudget last year and because 2 out of the last 4 years we have not \npassed a budget, we have lost most of the really effective enforcement \nmechanisms or are on the verge of losing most of those enforcement \nmechanisms in the next budget cycle. So it is critical we get a budget \nto put those enforcement mechanisms back into place so we can control \nin the short term the rate of growth of a number of accounts but \nespecially the discretionary accounts.\n\n[[Page S4483]]\n\n  We put in place a budget which moves us toward reducing the deficit \nin half over 4 years. That is one deficit issue. More importantly, the \nbig issue, which I have just discussed, which is this long-term fiscal \ncatastrophe we are headed toward as a nation unless we do something \nabout it, we begin to address that. We do not do radical steps in that \ndirection. This is going to be a long and arduous process. It is \ndifficult, and it is going to be a bumpy road, but what we do is we \ntake some very significant steps down that road toward reintroducing \nfiscal restraint into the entitlement accounts that we have under our \ncontrol and that we are willing to address.\n  We do this in two specific accounts that are critical: Medicaid and \nsomething called the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. We can look \nat these three accounts--Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid--as \nbeing the primary drivers of our problem, but there are other issues \nout there that are very significant in driving our fiscal problems, and \none of them is the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. It is a \ncorporation that makes sure, if you have a pension, a defined benefit \nplan, and your company goes under, the Federal Government guarantees \nthat pension.\n\n  The taxpayers end up with a bill for doing that, by the way. \nMismanagement on a corporation's behalf, excessive benefits structure, \npoor management in the marketplace, a company goes under, and the \ntaxpayers end up with the bill. That projected liability out there \ntoday, the contingent liability of the taxpayers of the United States \nfor the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, is estimated to be $25 \nbillion to $30 billion, and it may be radically higher than that, to be \nvery honest.\n  So we need to reform that system, and the budget we are addressing \ntoday begins that process. We try to address that niche issue of \nsignificant fiscal problems we have as a nation, which is correcting \nthe Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.\n  Equally and even more important is we step forward on one of three \nentitlement accounts. We only have jurisdiction over two of the three, \nas I mentioned earlier. We step forward on the Medicaid issue, and we \nput in place--Senator Smith basically orchestrated this, and he is \ngoing to talk about it--a process to move to get substantive reform in \nthe Medicaid accounts so they are affordable and continue to deliver a \nquality service to kids in need and people who have to go into nursing \nhomes and cannot afford it, but at the same time they are affordable.\n  What we do is have an advisory committee or a commission set up which \nwill study the issue. It must report by September 1. We have a \nreconciliation instruction which says the committee of jurisdiction has \nto come back and reduce the rate of growth of Medicaid by $10 billion. \nI will get back to that. And we limit that action on the $10 billion \nreduction, so we delay it a year. So there is a year to get ready to do \nthat.\n  I want to put this $10 billion in context because this is a major \nsavings item of the budget in the area of entitlement reform. Over the \nnext 5 years, we are going to spend $1.12 trillion, a huge amount of \nmoney, on Medicaid. This budget is suggesting that we reduce that rate \nof spending over the next 5 years by $10 billion; $10 billion on a \n$1.12 trillion base, approximately 1 percent. One would think we were \nscorching the Earth when we initially proposed this. Obviously not.\n  The practical effect of this is we are taking a program that is going \nto grow at 41 percent over the next 5 years and reducing its rate of \ngrowth to 39 percent. We can do that. If we are halfway decent as \nmanagers of the tax dollars of Americans, we can do that, reduce 1 \npercent off a program that is growing so quickly, reduce its rate of \ngrowth from 41 percent back to 39 percent.\n  In fact, we can do that, and we can actually give more services to \nmore kids and more people who are deserving of it. The reason is that \nMedicaid, unfortunately, has some problems right now in the way it is \nfunctioning. There is a fair amount of Medicaid money which is being \nshifted from the delivery of service to needy children and to people \nwho need help going into nursing homes over to simply the general \noperation of State government. That should not happen anymore, and we \ncan end that.\n  Unfortunately, there is a lot of abuse, where people are spending \ndown in order to qualify for Medicaid and hiding assets and \ntransferring over to the taxpayers costs which they should fairly bear.\n  There are significant savings which can occur in the way we purchase \npharmaceuticals under Medicaid. There is a whole list of items which \nGovernors are willing to consider in order to accomplish savings. But \nwhat the Governors need is more flexibility. We give the Governors more \nflexibility and a little less rate of growth in this program, and they \nare going to deliver more services to more people at less cost. It is \nthat simple. A good Governor will do that, and there are a lot of \nGovernors out there willing to try.\n  So there has been a compromise we reached on Medicaid which has been \norchestrated and energized by Senator Smith of Oregon. I congratulate \nhim for it. It is a good compromise because it will start us on the \npath toward looking at public policy which will start to address--it is \nnot going to resolve the problem--will start to address the issue of \nthis element of the entitlement problem, the Medicaid element of this \nchart, and it is one of the three major items.\n  In addition, as I mentioned, we have taken up the PBGC issue. This is \nthe first budget in 7 years which has stepped on the sacred ground of \nentitlements and tried to manage them at least marginally. The total \namount of entitlement for reconciliation savings--not all of it is \nentitlement--but the total amount of reconciliation savings in this \nbill is approximately $35 billion. That is a very reasonable number. \nThat is a 5-year number. So it is something that can certainly be \naccomplished.\n  The third thing that this budget does is it continues to energize \neconomic growth. When the President came into office, he was confronted \nwith a very severe recession as a result of the burst of the Internet \nbubble. That was compounded, of course, by the attack of\n9/11, which caused our economy to stumble severely as a result of the \nadjustment to what was a new world. Then we had to dramatically expand \nour commitment to national defense and homeland security in order to \nparticipate aggressively in finding the people who were responsible for \nthis horrific act of 9/11 and making sure that we are as well prepared \nas possible in avoiding another attack.\n  So the President was confronted with an unfortunate set of facts \nrelative to the economy, and there was a recession. But that \nrecession's severity was significantly reduced because this President \nhad the foresight to reduce the tax burden on America's workers early \nso that people were allowed to keep their money and there was incentive \nfor entrepreneurship, an incentive to go out and work harder, and an \nincentive to create jobs. The recession was shallowed out as a result \nof that. Now we are seeing a dramatic turnaround in the amount of \nrevenues the Federal Government is receiving because of that.\n  Revenues dropped precipitously, everyone knows that, but they dropped \nbecause we were in a recession and because we were attacked. The tax \ncut that was put in place has essentially helped us recover in the \nrevenues area because people have gone out and they have become more \nproductive as they have been willing to work harder, earn more, and \ncreate more jobs because the tax burden has been reduced. The function \nof that is that more incentive is created to be productive.\n  We are seeing the results. Last year, tax revenues grew at 9 percent. \nThis year, they are going to grow around 7 percent or maybe even \nfaster. The month of April, which has not been formally reported yet, \nlooks like it is going to be one of the highest collection months as \nfar as revenue goes in the history of the country, a dramatic jump in \nrevenues as a result of the tax cut. For the foreseeable future it is \nexpected under this budget, and I think under all economic assumptions, \nthat tax revenues are going to continue to compound at a rate of about \n6 to 6\\1/2\\ percent as a result of a strong economy, driven by a good \ntax policy.\n  We continue that tax policy in this bill. This bill does not assume \nany new tax cuts, but it does assume that tax\n\n[[Page S4484]]\n\ncuts that are on the books, that are very constructive, and which \npeople use in their day-to-day life will be continued--tax cuts such as \nthe R tax cut, the research and experimentation tax cut, the \ndeduction for teachers' classroom expenses, the deduction for qualified \neducation expenses, the deduction for State and local taxes, the \nwelfare-to-work tax credit. These are tax credits that are continued.\n  We hear a lot of talk from the other side of the aisle that, oh, \nthere are just not enough tax increases in this bill; we have to raise \ntaxes. Which one of these deductions which is about to expire does the \nother side of the aisle want to allow to expire and put more burden on \nAmerican workers? I doubt there are very many that would fall into that \ncategory that are on this list, and that is what this bill assumes--\nthat we will continue in place tax proposals which encourage people to \nbe more productive, such as the R tax cut, or give people a benefit \nthey deserve, such as teachers being allowed to expense classroom \ncosts, and that are popular. So we will continue a tax policy under \nthis bill which will continue to energize economic growth.\n  As we have brought this budget forward, it puts us on a path to \naccomplishing positive steps in the area of fiscal responsibility and \nfiscal restraint. It is a budget which reflects the President's initial \nbudget which was a commitment to trying to begin to address the \ndeficits in the short run and, more importantly, the long-term issue of \nthe fiscal problems we confront because of the demographic boom which I \nmentioned, which is coming at us. For that reason, it is a very \npositive budget.\n  I wish to make one more point about the budget before I yield to the \nSenator from Oregon, whose thoughts are very important here because he \nis one of the key players in addressing this critical issue of \nMedicaid. This budget is critical because it also puts back in place \nand actually energizes new initiatives in the area of enforcement \nmechanisms. These are procedural things, yes, and they are arcane \nthings, yes. Most people do not understand what they are, that is true. \nBut it was interesting, when Alan Greenspan testified before the Budget \nCommittee last week, he said the most significant thing that had \nhappened in the area of disciplining Federal spending was that we had \nbudget enforcement mechanisms in place through the late 1990s and early \n2000 period and we needed to reinitiate those initiatives. By law, we \ncannot pick them all up because this is a resolution, not a law. The \nway this works, we cannot pick them all up. But to the extent that the \nbudget resolution can put back in place and strengthen enforcement \nmechanisms to allow this Congress to be disciplined in the way it \nspends money, this resolution does that in an extraordinarily \naggressive way.\n  So this is a good resolution. It is a positive step. It takes us on \nthe right direction toward fiscal discipline. I certainly hope my \ncolleagues will support us in moving it forward.\n  Now I yield to the Senator from Oregon such time as he may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, Senator Gregg, for yielding time but much more for his \npatience with all of his colleagues--and I suppose myself primarily--\nduring what has been a very difficult and grueling period of time for \nthe majority and even some in the minority who are focused on this \nissue.\n  I also want to express my appreciation to Bill Frist, the majority \nleader, and Mitch McConnell, the whip, who have come at this \nresponsibility of producing a budget with determination and \nunderstanding that without a budget, we have considerable chaos in this \nChamber. To the general public it probably looks as if we are in chaos \nall the time, but they have seen nothing until they have seen us \nwithout a budget.\n  As I have approached this budget, two things have been apparent to \nme. No. 1, that we had to have a budget. I understand the institutional \nresponsibility the majority carries when it comes to advancing the \nlegislative work of the American people. I have also been mindful for \nsome time that Medicaid needs reform, restructuring, and, in my view, \nrestructuring not unlike what the State of Oregon has done with the \nOregon health plan, to make sure that those intended to be served and \ncovered, those legitimate and truly eligible, find access to this \nessential strand in America's safety net.\n  Each one of us in this Chamber comes from their own perspectives and \nwith their own sense of responsibility, their own history from their \nStates. In my case, I come from a State that prides itself on \npioneering in many ways, not the least of which is in the area of \nhealth care. One of the crown jewels of that pioneering is the Oregon \nhealth plan, which was an effort on the part of one of our former \nGovernors, John Kitzhaber, to find a way, with the resources available \nthrough the Federal match with State resources, to cover more people \nmore effectively with preventive medicine and essential services in a \nway that gets the most bang for the medical buck.\n  Clearly, America will come to a point when more people of the baby \nboom generation come on to Medicaid where such a model or something \nsimilar will be necessary for our country to both afford it and to \nprovide it. So as I approached this budget, it was with caution, \nespecially caution due to the people who are covered by Medicaid. These \nare the elderly, the poor, the disabled, the unusually vulnerable in \nour society, who when they are thrown off of Medicaid are thrown into \nemergency rooms, where the cost of their medicine is simply shifted \nover time on to the escalating costs of private plans which many small \nbusinesses struggle today to continue to provide to their employees.\n\n  When we came to this debate, I was very mindful that the House of \nRepresentatives had passed a reconciliation number which, in the case \nof their Chamber, I believe was $18.5 billion over 5 years to the Ways \nand Means Committee and $20 billion to the House Commerce Committee, a \ntotal of $38.5 billion over 5 years. That is a very large number, and \nthe programs to be affected were not Social Security. It was announced \nthat Medicare would not be touched. That leaves, on the list of \nprograms, very few.\n  So it was my feeling--despite my high regard for the budget chairman, \nSenator Gregg--that I needed to engage and, if I could, to take out the \nSenate number, which was $14 billion. He and others were honest enough \nto say it was to Medicaid. So the Senate went to zero.\n  Then comes the clash of institutional responsibility, the ability to \ndo the Nation's business without in any way, in my view, putting such \nundue pressure upon Medicaid as a class of people that should not be \nborne in haste, or done in haste, by putting a budget number ahead of \nsound policy.\n  I know that the people in the medical community who are counting on \nus want us to do this right, if we do it at all. I know many of them \nwould have liked a budget with a number that remained at zero. That has \nnot been possible. But the minimum number that I was told, necessary to \nget a budget, was $10 billion over 5 years, with no cuts required in \nthe first year. That also was coupled with the creation of a \ncommission. You will look through this budget and you will not find a \ncommission in it because that is not the kind of thing you put in a \nbudget. A commission is something that Congress could create, but it \ncan more quickly be created through an executive decision, with \nresources currently allocated, so that work can begin in a more timely \nway.\n  I want to make it also clear that the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices, the former Governor of Utah, Mike Leavitt, is a person in \nwhom I have implicit confidence. He is a man of integrity. He is a man \nof his word. He is a man who understands that his reputation and mine \nare on the line in constructing the kind of commission that is \ninclusive, that is bipartisan, that is academic in its nature, and is \ncharged with the responsibility to produce a Medicaid program--not just \nshort term but long term--that is a system that we can be proud of and \nthat will serve the people who need its coverage.\n  It is the strong desire of the Senate, and I do not speak for my \nDemocratic colleagues, but my partner in this effort, Senator Jeff \nBingaman of New Mexico, he and I and our staffs have been working \nacross the aisle to create\n\n[[Page S4485]]\n\nthe kind of credible structure to recommend to the Secretary. Ideally, \nand it is my strong urge and plea, this commission will be conducted by \nthe Institute of Medicine. They will be charged to provide to us, by \nearly September, their recommendations of what ways the Senate Finance \nCommittee and the House Commerce Committee can respond to the \nreconciliation number. I will not prejudge what they will say, but I \nknow they will say it in a way that will be acceptable to Republican \nand Democratic ears and will give this the kind of academic focus it \ntruly deserves.\n  But that is a work in progress. Ultimately, you have to trust people \nto be good, to live up to the public statements they make. The \nPresident's administration has made it clear that they approve of the \ncreation of this commission. The majority leader, Senator Frist, has \nalso assured me of a colloquy that will be part of this budget to the \nSenate, how we will proceed. Ultimately, the work of the commission \nwill go to the Senate Finance Committee, and there we will take up \ndeciding what should be done under reconciliation.\n  The Senate Finance Committee is composed of thoughtful people, all of \nwhom, with few exceptions, are anxious to do this right and to serve \nthe people that ought to be served. I hope that everyone will \nunderstand this has not been easy, but I think much has been achieved \nin terms of checks and balances as we proceed.\n  No one can deny that the awful arithmetic of American demographics \nconfronts future Congresses with a demographic tsunami, and we have to \nfind ways to keep our safety net strong without bankrupting our \ntaxpayers and particularly our children and grandchildren. I think they \nwould want us to do this carefully, to do it right, to do it on the \nbasis of good policy instead of numbers which may, in some cases, be \narrived at arbitrarily. But we are going to begin now because this \nbudget should pass. I would say to all of my colleagues who are \nwondering, as I have, whether to vote for this budget: I have yet to \nvote for a budget with which I found myself in agreement with \neverything. I have never voted on a perfect piece of legislation.\n  But I also remember the time when my party was briefly in the \nminority and the majority party at the time was unable to come up with \na budget at all, and we truly had a chaotic situation. We cannot have \nthat if people are sincere about managing spending and setting this \ncountry on a path of promise-keeping, not just to those served, but \nalso to today's and tomorrow's taxpayers.\n  So I ask my colleagues, particularly those who voted with me to \nremove the $14 billion, to now vote in good faith for this budget that \nSenator Gregg has brought to the floor. It has been a difficult \nprocess, and again I say I believe our leaders are to be credited. They \nhave dealt in good faith. They have a tough job to do, and each of us \nin this Chamber has principles that we are trying to defend. But this \nis not the final number. The final number is done in the authorizing \ncommittees--in the House Commerce Committee and in the Senate Finance \nCommittee. There is a long way to go. So to those who care about \nMedicaid, to those who are served by Medicaid: Be engaged and know that \nmy office, my heart, my mind are open to you in order to do this right \nand not just to do it fast. But, having said that, it is necessary for \nus to go beyond where we are now, which is operating without a budget \nat all, because appropriations need to be made, important legislation \nhas to pass, and a budget is the cornerstone of making all this work \nbegin to proceed.\n  I thank Chairman Gregg for the time, for his understanding, and for \nhis coming to the Senate and bringing the best budget we can produce \nunder all the competing interests and demands.\n  This is, while not perfect--and I have a long list of things I would \nrather not be there--this is a beginning and not an ending. But we do \nnot get to the end until we finish this budget.\n  I announce my support for it and urge all of my colleagues to join in \napproving it this evening.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oregon. His \nefforts have been immense. Quite honestly, the budget would not be on \nthe floor and we would not have a chance if it were not for the \nSenator's courtesy and efforts. He had strong points and made them very \neffectively. As a result, we will make progress here not only on the \nentire budget but on what I consider to be the core element of this \nexercise, which is trying to get a reasonable approach to one of the \nmajor entitlement accounts.\n  I congratulate the Senator. He has had a huge impact. The Senator \nknows how to get things done around here. I appreciate his courtesy to \nme.\n  Mr. President, the time until Senator Conrad arrives will be charged \nto my account. When Senator Conrad arrives, he will take an equal \namount of time to what we have used. That was the unanimous consent we \nentered into. After that, I ask unanimous consent time spent in quorum \ncalls during the consideration of the bill be counted equally against \nboth sides, the majority and the minority, for debate time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the Senator from Oregon has made the point \nvery well, but what is important is important to the majority, \nspecifically, the essence of governance. You cannot govern unless you \nare willing to set out the principles by which you govern, especially \nthe blueprint which is going to guide you in the governance activity.\n  Obviously, one of the most significant things done when you are the \nmajority party and you have the presence, you make the decisions, basic \ndecisions as to how the country's finances will be managed and how \nmoneys will be spent and that they will be shepherded well.\n  These are tax dollars. People work hard. Every day people are putting \nin a full day's work and the Federal Government, every day, comes along \nand says, You worked all day long, we will take ``X'' percentage of the \nmoney you earned. We will take it right out of your pocket and we will \nspend it on a series of things.\n  What is important is that the American people first know what we are \ngoing to spend it on and how we will spend it--that is where a budget \ncomes into play--and that we be good shepherds of those dollars and use \nthem effectively so people can retain as much money as possible in \ntheir pockets to spend on what they know is important in their lives, \nand the Government does not take it and spend it for them and tell them \nhow their money should be spent, and that we function in a way we get \nthe type of government that delivers the services that are critical to \nmaking sure we can defend ourselves and take care of the less fortunate \nin this Nation, make sure we have strong education, make sure we have \ngood health systems, that we can continue as a nation to have a vibrant \nand a strong economy.\n  This all starts with a budget. It is that simple. This is not the end \nof the product. This is the beginning of the exercise. If you do not \nhave that blueprint in place, it makes the rest of the process \nextremely complicated and much more difficult.\n  It is critical we pass this resolution. I strongly believe this \nresolution is a responsible effort to try to bring our fiscal house in \norder and to make strides in the area of controlling the rate of growth \nin spending so it is affordable for our taxpayers, but, more \nimportantly, so it is affordable for the next generations who will have \nto pay the burden we put on the books today.\n  It does, for the first time, take that step in the area of \nentitlement or mandatory spending which has become 59 percent of the \nFederal Government. A lot of people say, what about the appropriations \nbills? Appropriations bills are the discretionary side of the budget. \nThey represent less than 30 percent of Federal spending. Half of that \nis defense, which we have to do today in a very aggressive way because \nwe have been attacked and are at war and people are out there who want \nto harm us. I held a hearing this morning on terrorists relative to \ntheir desire to use biological and chemical weapons against us. It is \nvery sobering, to say the least, but we have to defend ourselves and it \nwill take a lot of money to do that.\n\n  Of about 30 percent, half is defense, and the other part goes to \nnondefense discretionary so it is not the large part of the budget, of \nthe appropriations bills that come through. The most significant part \nof the budget is the part\n\n[[Page S4486]]\n\nof the entitlement accounts which never come across the Senate as \nindividual spending items such as appropriations bills do. They simply \nare on automatic pilot. Absolutely the only way we can address policy \neffectively in mandatory accounts is through something called the \nreconciliation process.\n  To quickly explain, that allows for the committees that have \njurisdiction over these entitlement programs that are already in place \nand that have grown radically over the years to take another look at \nthose programs and see if they are working as well as they could work. \nMedicaid is a classic example of a program that needs another look, \nwhere if we adjust it so Governors have more flexibility, we have a \nslower rate of growth in dollars, they can probably do a lot more for a \nlot more people if we give Governors the type of powers they need to \naccomplish that.\n  Reconciliation is the only avenue for effectively doing that type of \na review of the mandatory side of the ledger which represents 59 \npercent of Federal spending today. The reason it is the only effective \nway is because we all know nothing can go through this Congress--we \nhave been shown that in the last few weeks--nothing goes through this \nCongress that is controversial without 60 votes. We also know any sort \nof mandatory change is going to be controversial. Reconciliation gives \nthe opportunity to use a majority rather than a supermajority to review \nthese programs and to make progress in restraining their rate of growth \nand making them more effective in delivering services. That is why this \nbudget is a unique budget.\n  It is the first budget we have a shot at passing in the last 2 years. \nThe last 4 years we have only passed a budget twice. More importantly, \nsince 1997, there has not been a budget which is a step forward to try \nto address the very critical element of where the Federal Government \nstands and how it spends money in the area of mandatory entitlement \naccounts which represent 59 percent of Federal spending.\n  With that, I reserve our time, recognizing it is going to run against \nour side of the aisle, with the understanding the ranking member, \nSenator Conrad, will be here probably around 6 o'clock at which time I \nwill yield the floor to Senator Conrad.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum with the understanding the time \nwill run against our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeMint). Without objection, it is so \nordered. Who yields time to the Senator from Tennessee?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Tennessee such \ntime as he may consume or such time until the Senator from North Dakota \ngets here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Is it in order for me to take about 7 or 8 minutes to \nspeak on a subject other than the budget?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              John Bolton\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman. I \nam here to talk about President Bush's nominee to be our next permanent \nrepresentative to the United Nations, John Bolton. I am privileged to \nbe a member of the Foreign Relations Committee. A few weeks ago at Mr. \nBolton's first day of hearing, I heard what I expected to hear. In \nfact, I was unusually impressed by what I heard. I listened to a man \nwho has been confirmed four times by the Senate, who in the last 4 \nyears has been Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and \nInternational Security, Assistant Secretary for International \nOrganizations under the first President Bush, under whom I served, a \nperson who graduated summa cum laude from Yale, received his JD from \nYale, a person who helped repeal resolution 3379 equating Zionism with \nracism.\n  I listened very carefully. And while we have had a number of \ndistinguished U.N. ambassadors, I rarely have seen anyone who had such \na good grasp of diplomacy, of the United Nations, its resolutions, and \nits history. And during a period of about 7 hours, he handled himself \nwell, and there were tough questions asked. I was impressed with the \nfact that he had been endorsed by five former Secretaries of State and \nby more than 50 former ambassadors. I was with one of those former \nambassadors over the weekend, the former majority leader of this body, \nHoward Baker, with whom I and other Members had lunch Sunday. He \nremarked about how he had dealt with Secretary Bolton over the last 4 \nyears in Tokyo. He liked him. He was impressed with him. He said he \nspoke frankly, that he would be a good ambassador.\n  The second day of hearings was a little different. I was surprised \nand disappointed by what I heard. There was a man named Carl Ford, who \nwas well respected by members of the committee, who presented evidence \nthat John Bolton had ``chewed out,'' to use colloquial words, \nintelligence analysts in the State Department. Mr. Ford, to his credit, \ndidn't like that because those persons were down the line.\n  Mr. Ford was a pretty good witness because he didn't overstate his \ncase. He acknowledged that it wasn't unusual for policy people and \nintelligence analysts to argue, for policy people to hope for \nintelligence that supported their positions. He just didn't like the \nfact that in this case he had heard about--he wasn't there, he had \nheard about--that Mr. Bolton in effect chewed out one of Mr. Ford's \nemployees and Mr. Ford didn't like it. He told Mr. Bolton so and they \nexchanged words. That is what he said.\n  There have been some other things said about Mr. Bolton. I have had \nthe privilege of being confirmed by the Senate and going through a \nhearing. I am surprised the number of things they can find to say about \nyou when you go through a thing like that. I see the Senator from \nMassachusetts over there. He was chairman of the committee when I went \nthrough the nomination process, and the Democrats were in the majority \nat that time. So it is a good airing of about anything you can do and \nanything people can say about you. It serves a purpose.\n  There were some other things said. It was suggested that Mr. Bolton \nwas misusing intelligence, compromising intelligence. But Mr. Ford \nhimself said:\n\n       In this particular case--\n\n  The one he was led there to complain about--\n\n     there wasn't politicization [of the intelligence].\n\n  So that wasn't the case.\n  A little later, someone called up to say that Mr. Bolton had chased a \nUSAID contractor around a Moscow hotel to stop her from damaging his \nclient. This was when he was in the private sector. But then others, \nincluding the employer of that complaining person, disputed the \ncomplainer's account, and others did as well. So it boils down to the \nfact that the credible charge of Mr. Ford was that Mr. Bolton was rude \nto staff members below him in the bureaucracy.\n  I imagine Mr. Bolton is embarrassed by those charges. I didn't like \nto hear them. And perhaps he deserves to be embarrassed by the charges \nand perhaps he has learned a lesson. But what I heard doesn't change my \nvote, even though I hope it might change some of Mr. Bolton's ways of \ndealing with people with whom he works.\n  How significant is this charge that he was rude to people in the \nbureaucracy? As has been mentioned by others, if that were the standard \nfor remaining in the Senate, we would have a hard time getting a \nquorum. There are regularly occasions when busy Senators, eager to make \ntheir own point, are rude to their staff and even shout at one another. \nIn fact, the shouting was so loud in the Foreign Relations Committee \nroom by some of the Senators, I could barely hear the charges about Mr. \nBolton. That is not attractive, and I don't endorse it. It even caused \nme to think back about times that I may have become angry or impatient \nor startled in dealing with a staff member or another person, and made \nme redouble my efforts to make sure I swallow my pride and think about \nwhat I say and not do that anymore. It is not good business.\n  As I heard Senator Voinovich, who has a long reputation of caring for \ncivil servants and caring about those things,\n\n[[Page S4487]]\n\nmy guess is that was on his mind as well.\n  How significant is this? Here is what former Secretary of State Larry \nEagleburger had to say about it Sunday in the Washington Post. This \ndeserves special attention. Larry Eagleburger was Secretary of State \nfor the first President Bush, but in a way he was more than that. He \nhad 27 years in the foreign service. We hear about a football player is \na football player's player or a man is a man's man or a woman is a \nwoman's woman. Larry Eagleburger is a foreign service officer's \nSecretary of State. He had and has enormous respect from all those men \nand women who put their lives on the line around the world and in the \nUnited States in support of our diplomacy and foreign policy. Here is \nwhat he said:\n\n       As to the charge that Bolton has been tough on \n     subordinates, I can say only that in more than a decade of \n     association with him in the State Department I never saw or \n     heard anything to support such a charge. Nor do I see \n     anything wrong with challenging intelligence analysts on \n     their findings. They can, as recent history demonstrates, \n     make mistakes. And they must be prepared to defend their \n     findings under intense questioning. If John pushed too hard \n     or dressed down subordinates, he deserves criticism, but it \n     hardly merits a vote against confirmation when balanced \n     against his many accomplishments.\n  That is where I am. I think the benefit of hearing Mr. Ford's \ntestimony might be a little bit of a lesson to Mr. Bolton and a \nreminder to the rest of us of how unattractive it is to shout at an \nassociate or unnecessarily dress down a staff member. I agree with \nSecretary Eagleburger. John Bolton has a distinguished background and \nrecord. He has dedicated himself to improving our country's foreign \npolicy. His action toward subordinates might have been inappropriate. \nPerhaps he has learned a lesson, but it doesn't cause me to change my \nvote. I am glad to support him.\n  This is a critical time for the United Nations. Even the Secretary \nGeneral acknowledges it is in need of reform. Billions of dollars \nfiltered from the U.N. coffers to Saddam Hussein's pockets in the oil-\nfor-food scandal. Top human rights abusers such as Sudan sit on the \nHuman Rights Commission. United Nations peacekeepers in Africa have \nbeen found to rape and pillage. Just today, the United Nations \nappointed Zimbabwe to the Human Rights Commission.\n  Now the United Nations has many important roles in the world. I am \nglad we have it. I want it to work, but I believe the President is \nright in his thinking, that we need to take action to help the U.N. \nreform itself, and that a frank-talking, experienced diplomat named \nJohn Bolton is an excellent candidate for that commission. I intend to \nvote for him in committee and on the floor. It is my hope that when we \ncome back after the recess, we will have the long hearing as we usually \ndo, and all the Senators will have a chance to say what they have to \nsay--hopefully without shouting at one another--and that we will report \nit to the floor and the Senate will approve Mr. Bolton's nomination and \ngive him a chance to go to work in reforming the U.N.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to this \nbudget. I believe it is a profound mistake for this country to stack \nadditional debt upon already record levels of debt that I believe puts \nthe long-term economic security of our country at risk.\n  The record is very clear. We now face record budget deficits, and we \nface them for as far as the eye can see. Those who have assured us \nrepeatedly that deficits are being dealt with have failed the \ncredibility test, and they have absolutely failed the test of fiscal \nresponsibility. This budget bears no relationship to fiscal \nconservatism or fiscal responsibility, and this vote will be a defining \nvote on where Members stand with respect to fiscal responsibility for \nthis country.\n  Here is the record on deficits. Since 2001 the deficits have soared \nto new records, levels we have never seen in the history of the \ncountry--$412 billion in 2004 and very little improvement anywhere in \nsight.\n  As we review back to 1980 the relationship between spending, here is \nwhat we see. The red line is the spending line of the United States, \nthe green line is the revenue line. We can see spending has been \nbrought down as a share of gross domestic product rather steadily until \nthis administration. In fact, it is interesting, in the entire 8 years \nof the Clinton administration, spending came down steadily as a share \nof GDP. We have now had an increase, largely as a result of the attack \nof September 11 because 91 percent of this increase is defense, \nhomeland security, aid to New York, and aid to the airlines.\n  Going forward, we see that spending will stay roughly at these levels \ngoing forward, with some slight additional increase as we get closer to \nthe time when the baby boomers retire.\n  Look at the revenue line of the United States. Also during the \nClinton administration, revenue rose each and every year so that \nfinally we did away with deficits and, in addition, we actually stopped \nraiding the Social Security trust fund to use it for other purposes.\n  President Bush came to office, and the revenue side of the equation \nhas collapsed. Last year, revenue was the lowest it has been as a share \nof GDP since 1959. The President said when revenue was high as a share \nof GDP, we must have tax cuts. Now that revenue is at a 50-year low, \nthe President's answer is more tax cuts. The result is a huge ongoing \ngap between spending and revenue that means ever-increasing debt, and \nall of it at the worst possible time before the baby boomers retire.\n  Here is what the Comptroller General of the United States said in a \nspeech to the National Press Club on February 2 of this year. He said:\n\n       The simple truth is that our Nation's financial condition \n     is much worse than advertised.\n\n  The Comptroller General of the United States had that exactly right. \nOur financial condition is far worse than advertised. In fact, my first \nchart showed the deficit at just over $400 billion in 2004, at $412 \nbillion. But that is not how much was added to the debt that year. It \nwas far more because the deficit understates the seriousness of our \nfinancial condition. So, too, does the budget that was sent to us by \nthe President of the United States. The President told the American \npeople that he is cutting the deficit in half over the next 5 years, \nbut the only way he got there is just by leaving out things. He left \nout any war costs past September 30 of this year. Does anybody believe \nthere is not going to be any war costs past September 30 of this year?\n  Here is what we have. The President sent up a supplemental. That \npassed the Senate and is in conference committee now. The supplemental \nis $82 billion for ongoing military operations in fiscal year 2005 but \nnothing past September 30. Look what the Congressional Budget Office \ntells us should be in the budget: $383 billion. That is their estimate \nof residual war costs.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question on \nthat chart?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes, I will be happy to.\n  Mr. SARBANES. As I understand it, the President's budget, and this \nbudget resolution, do not provide anything for the long-term costs of \nIraq, Afghanistan, and the continuing war on terror?\n  Mr. CONRAD. It does not. We have this supplemental, as the Senator \nknows, that is going through the process. We passed it in the Senate. \nIt is in conference committee now. It is $82 billion. Much of it will \nbe spent this year; some of it will slop over to next year. This is \nwhat the Congressional Budget Office says should be in any realistic \nbudget--not $82 billion, but $380 billion, and it is this gap which is \npart of the unrealistic nature of the budget that is before us and the \nbudget the President sent us.\n  Mr. SARBANES. So the budget is not really presenting a true picture \nof what we can anticipate in terms of expenditures; is that correct?\n  Mr. CONRAD. No, it really is not. I think any objective observer in \nreading this budget would have to say it is not\n\n[[Page S4488]]\n\na realistic picture of our financial condition. It just leaves out \nthings. In fact, when the President's people came to me and told me how \nthey were going to cut the deficit in half, I said to them: Why don't \nyou just leave out some more things and claim you balanced the budget \nbecause it would have about as much attachment to reality as this has.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Are there other items they have left out besides the \ncosts of Iraq and Afghanistan?\n  Mr. CONRAD. There certainly are other items. One of the items that is \nleft out is the true cost of the President's tax cut proposals because \nthe President switched from 10-year budgeting to 5-year budgeting, and \nI think here is why. The dotted line shows the end of the 5 years, and \nthis chart shows the cost of the President's tax cut proposals. As we \ncan see, it is very interesting, right after the fifth year of this \nbudget, the cost of the President's tax cut proposals takes off like a \nscalded cat. None of that is captured by the President's budget because \nhis budget ends right here at this dotted line. But look what happens \nright past the dotted line. The revenue hemorrhage escalates \ndramatically, and it is not just there, but it is also with respect to \nthe alternative minute tax, the old millionaire's tax that is rapidly \nbecoming a middle-class tax trap.\n\n  Here is the trend line of the cost to fix the alternative minimum \ntax. It is straight up, and there is no funding in the President's \nbudget to deal with it. So with 3 million people affected by the \nalternative minimum tax last year, 10 years from now it is going to be \n40 million people a year. It costs $774 billion to fix. Last year, the \nPresident had 1 year of funding to deal with it. He has no funding in \nhis budget this year to deal with it. And so, again, it is an \nunrealistic budget because it does not capture items we all know are \ngoing to have to be dealt with.\n  Perhaps most remarkably, the President's budget, as the budget before \nus, does not contain any money for the Social Security Program the \nPresident champions and that is championed by many on the other side of \nthe aisle. There is no money. We know the President's proposal costs \nmoney. In fact, in the first 10 years, it costs $754 billion. There is \nno money in the budget. Over 20 years, the cost of the President's plan \nis $4.4 trillion--not a dime of it in the budget. This is not really a \nbudget. It is a political statement, perhaps, but it is certainly not a \nbudget.\n  When we go back and add back the items the President has left out, \njust the major items--the alternative minimum tax, the ongoing war \ncosts, according to the Congressional Budget Office the cost of the \nPresident's privatization plan--instead of this trend line which the \nPresident is predicting, instead we see this hashed red line.\n  Over the next 10 years, this is where we see the deficits going under \nthe President's plan. The budget before us has much the same pattern, \nexploding deficits for as far as the eye can see and at the worst \npossible time, right before the baby boomers retire.\n  Mr. SARBANES. What would the deficits be if all of these things are \nincluded?\n  Mr. CONRAD. As we see these deficits, we go back to this chart, and \nthe President is saying they will be in the $200 billion range at the \nend of this 5-year period. We do not see that at all. As we can see, \nthey will be in the $350 billion range. Of course, this, too, \nunderstates the real magnitude of our problem because it does not \ncapture all that is being added to the debt.\n  Look where this goes the second 5 years--to deficits of $620 billion. \nIn a moment I will get to how much is being added to the debt under \nthis budget because I think that is critically important for people to \nunderstand. Our friends on the other side of the aisle talk a lot about \ndeficits these days. They never talk about the debt. The debt is the \naccumulation of all the deficits.\n  Obviously we face a big demographic challenge going forward. I have \nindicated all of this is happening at a bad time because the baby \nboomers are about to retire. Here is what we see. We are going to go \nfrom about 40 million people eligible for Social Security and Medicare \nto 81 million eligible. That is a key reason we ought to be running \nmore balanced budgets at this time.\n  The President told us back in 2002 that:\n\n       None of the Social Security surplus will be used to fund \n     other spending initiatives or tax relief.\n\n  That is what he told us. None of the Social Security money would be \nused to fund other spending initiatives or tax relief. Now we are able \nto have the benefit of several more years and we are able to look at \nthe record and see what the President's budget will do going forward. \nThe President said none of the Social Security surplus would be used \nfor tax cuts, or other spending initiatives.\n  Under the budget that is before us from the President and under the \nbudget before us by the majority party, every penny of the Social \nSecurity surplus is going to be used under the President's plan for the \nnext 5 years and, by extension, the next 10 years, $2.5 trillion--$2.5 \ntrillion of payroll tax money, which is supposed to be used to support \nSocial Security, being used to pay for other things. In effect, it is \nbeing used to subsidize his massive income tax cuts for the wealthiest \namong us, and being used to pay for other things.\n  The irony of this is the President says Social Security is $3.7 \ntrillion short over the next 75 years, but in his budget he is taking \n$2.5 trillion of Social Security money in the next 10 years alone and \nusing it to pay for other things.\n  I think this whole picture becomes more clear if one puts it all \ntogether. This is the reason I so strongly oppose this budget that is \non the floor. I say to my colleagues, anybody who votes for this budget \nshould never make another campaign claim that they are fiscally \nresponsible or fiscally conservative because this budget absolutely is \na testimony to those who worship at the altar of debt. This budget \nbuilds debt on top of debt.\n  Going forward, this chart shows the Social Security trust fund \nsurpluses, which are the green bars. The blue bars are the Medicare \ntrust fund. The red bars are the President's tax cuts. What one sees is \nthe Social Security and Medicare trust funds go cash negative at that \nvery time the cost of the President's tax cuts explodes, driving us \nright over the cliff into massive deficit and debt. That is where this \nis all headed.\n  The President says Social Security is a problem and, of course, he is \ncorrect. The 75-year shortfall in Social Security is $4 trillion. The \n75-year shortfall in Medicare is 7 times as much. The 75-year shortfall \nin Medicare is $29.6 trillion. This is according to the Social Security \ntrustees.\n  One would say that is a big problem, that the President is not \naddressing this problem, not addressing these shortfalls. His proposals \nmake it all worse. His proposals take more money out of Social \nSecurity. The budget that is before us takes $2.5 trillion of Social \nSecurity money over the next 10 years and uses it to pay for other \nthings. Then the President comes with a proposal and says establish \nprivate accounts and divert more money out of Social Security, another \n$700 billion over the next 10 years. Over the next 20 years, he is \ntalking about diverting over $4 trillion out of Social Security. That \nis real money. It is no wonder Social Security has a shortfall. The \nPresident is helping to create the shortfall.\n  The President told us in 2001:\n\n     . . . (M)y budget pays down a record amount of national debt. \n     We will pay off $2 trillion of debt over the next decade. \n     That will be the largest debt reduction of any country, ever. \n     Future generations shouldn't be forced to pay back money that \n     we have borrowed. . . .\n\n  These are not my words. These are the President's words. The \nPresident said:\n\n     . . . Future generations shouldn't be forced to pay back \n     money that we have borrowed. We owe this kind of \n     responsibility to our children and grandchildren.\n\n  Those are good words. The President was right to utter them. The \nproblem is if one compares the record to the rhetoric, there is no \nconnection.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. When did the President make that statement?\n  Mr. CONRAD. That was made in March of 2001, when, the Senator will \nrecall, he was assuring us we could afford to have a massive defense \nbuildup,\n\n[[Page S4489]]\n\ndeep tax cuts, that it would all add up and he would be able to protect \nSocial Security and Medicare, not use the money for other purposes, and \nhe would have maximum paydown of the debt. He was wrong on every single \ncount. He was wrong by a country mile.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Grievously wrong. I gather we will probably see the \ntrue picture of what has happened over the succeeding 4 years, but we \ncontinue to run these deficits and we are getting deeper into debt all \nthe time. Is that not correct?\n  Mr. CONRAD. It is very interesting to compare this statement where \nthe President says he is going to have ``the largest debt reduction of \nany country, ever. Future generations shouldn't be forced to pay back \nmoney that we have borrowed,'' but here is what has actually happened. \nThere is no debt reduction. The debt is exploding. This is just the \npublicly held debt. The gross debt would be even a worse picture.\n  I have taken the debt that is the most restrained version of the debt \nof the United States. The President inherited $3.3 trillion in debt in \n2001. Under his plan, we are headed for over $9 trillion of debt by \n2015. Increasingly, this money is being borrowed from abroad.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would be happy to.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the debt keeps running up, then the carrying charge \non the debt goes up every year. So more and more of the annual budget \nis consumed in order to pay the interest charge on the debt that was \nbuilt up because deficits have been run before, is that correct?\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator is exactly correct. I think one of the things \nthat is so disturbing about this is an increasingly large part of our \nbudget is being consumed by interest costs to service this debt. It is \ngoing to do nothing but get worse. Part of the result of that is, not \nonly are we borrowing money from ourselves but increasingly we are \nborrowing money from abroad. If we look at what we now owe abroad, here \nis what we see. These are stunning numbers, I might say, but this is \nthe latest information we have on what we owe other countries.\n  We owe Japan over $700 billion. We owe China, now, almost $200 \nbillion. We owe the United Kingdom over $171 billion. I am reading a \nbook on George Washington. He would be turning in his grave to think \nour country owes Great Britain $171 billion. We owe the Caribbean \nBanking Centers over $100 billion. I don't know what the Caribbean \nBanking Centers constitute, or where they get their money, but we owe \nthem over $100 billion. We owe South Korea over $67 billion.\n  The pattern that is so clear is the extraordinary increase in foreign \nholdings of our debt. The foreign holdings of our debt have increased \nalmost 100 percent since President Bush took office. That is an utterly \nunsustainable course. Foreign holdings of our debt have gone up almost \n100 percent since 2001.\n  Some people look at that and ask, what difference does it make? Isn't \nthat just fine, someone is willing to loan us money? Shouldn't we take \nJapan's money? Shouldn't we take China's money? What is the difference \nit makes?\n  Here is the difference it makes: What happens when they decide to \nquit loaning us all this money? What happens if they decide they do not \nlike the idea of loaning us this huge amount of money?\n  This was in the Financial Times in January of this year ``Central \nbanks shun U.S. assets.'' ``Shifting reserves to eurozone will deepen \nBush's difficulties in funding deficit.'' ``Actions likely to undermine \ndollar's value further.'' We can connect the dots.\n  Here is what has happened to the value of the dollar since 2002. \nAgainst the Euro, the dollar has declined 34 percent. If you were one \nof these countries holding all of these dollars and you see the value \nof the currency declining, might you get the idea it is time to put \nyour money some other place? We have already seen the warning signs. \nSouth Korea, a month or so ago, indicated they might diversify out of \ndollar-dominated securities and the stock market went down 170 points. \nWeeks later, the Japanese Premier said they might diversify out of \ndollar-dominated securities and the dollar took a huge hit. In March of \nthis year, perhaps the most successful American investor of our time, \nWarren Buffett, said he is going to bet against the American dollar \nagain this year because of this pattern. The currency value is \ndeclining, and declining sharply. Warren Buffett tells us a key reason \nis these massive deficits we are running--trade deficit, budget \ndeficit--are forcing us to borrow more and more money from abroad.\n  I say to those who might be listening, how does it make America \nstronger to borrow more and more money from abroad? How does that make \nus stronger?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, that is the question I wanted to put to \nmy colleague.\n  As I understand what is happening, we are becoming increasingly \ndependent economically on countries abroad. We are losing control over \nour own economic destiny.\n  They say, well, they are still willing to lend us this money. That \nmay be, but in the course of doing it, we become more and more \ndependent upon them. They can continue to give us the money, we get \ndeeper and deeper into the hole, which then raises the prospect that if \nthey shift their policy, we can take a very serious hit. There is no \ncommentator I have read who believes we can continue on this path \nindefinitely. At some time there will be a reckoning.\n  What has happened is the United States has become dependent on the \nkindness of strangers. We say we are No. 1, that we have the world's \nstrongest economy. Yet we are in hock to everyone around the world.\n  The Senator showed the figures of the holdings of other countries. \nThe China figures, which are still well short of Japan, are going up on \nan ascending trend that is almost breathtaking in terms of how much \ndeeper we get into hock.\n  I ask the Senator, not only does that have serious economic \nimplications, but doesn't it also reduce our ability to deal on \nimportant political and security issues when we are this indebted and \nthis dependent on others in economic terms? They are in a position to \ngive a real jolt to our economy if they choose to do so, which then, it \nseems to me, restricts our ability to deal on a whole range of other \nissues we may have with one or another of these countries.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Here we face these massive trade deficits. The trade \ndeficit was over $600 billion last year. For the most recent month, \nafter the dollar has declined dramatically, it is supposed to improve \nour trade situation. What happened to the trade deficit? Did it go \ndown? No. In the most recent month, the trade deficit was $61 billion, \nthe biggest ever. That is after the dollar has declined 34 percent. It \nmakes our goods less expensive and makes foreign goods more expensive. \nThat should have improved our trade position, and yet it did not.\n  We have a problem. The sooner we face up to it, the better. None of \nthis adds up.\n  You can live beyond your means for a time. A family can do it. An \nindividual can do it. A government can do it a lot longer because \ngovernments can print money. But there are consequences to that, as \nwell.\n  Those who say deficits do not matter, go ask the German people about \nafter World War I. Ask them whether they think deficits matter. We all \nknow what happened in Germany after World War I. The currency collapsed \nbecause of their heavy foreign indebtedness after the war.\n  What did they do? You wanted to buy shoes? You filled a wheelbarrow \nfull of the German currency because that is what it took to buy a pair \nof shoes.\n  We are not in that shape, and God forbid we ever get in that shape, \nbut the trend lines are not favorable. They are not good.\n  Our foreign holdings of our debt have gone up almost 100 percent. In \nfact, that chart is a little out of date because the truth is, it is \nalready over 100 percent. That is what has really happened. This debt \nis mushrooming every year, and under the budget that is before the \nSenate the debt of the United States is going to go up $600 billion a \nyear each and every year of this budget.\n  They say they have the deficit going down, and yet the debt is going \nup. What kind of doubletalk is that? The deficit is going down, but the \ndebt is\n\n[[Page S4490]]\n\ngoing up. It is going up $600 billion a year, every year. Anyone who \nvotes for this budget is voting for it.\n  The budget before the Senate leaves out the full 10-year numbers \nbecause they know past the 5 years everything gets worse. It leaves out \nfunding for the ongoing war beyond fiscal year 2006. It leaves out the \nalternative minimum tax reform. It leaves out the cost of Social \nSecurity privatization. When you add it all back, you get a very \ndifferent result than our colleagues are showing the American people.\n  When you go back and create a real budget, here is what we find. \nDeficits, massive deficits each and every year going forward, never \ngoing below $572 billion. That is not the full increase in the debt. \nThis leaves out things which we will get to in a moment.\n  Our friends on the other side say, well, we are reducing the deficit. \nIn one meeting we had--in the conference committee Democrats were \nexcluded, absolutely excluded from the negotiations on this budget. Let \nme repeat that: Democrats were not allowed or permitted to be in the \nroom when these discussions were undertaken.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the ranking member yield on that point?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Would the Senator agree with me that is an outrageous \ndeparture from the traditional practice in terms of how conference \ncommittees ought to operate? Traditionally, conference committees have \nmet, both parties have been included in the conference committee, \ndebate has taken place, issues have been raised, and decisions made. \nThe majority may be able to impose their decisions because that is how \nit gets decided, but there is an opportunity to try to shape the debate \nand have an influence on what is decided.\n  In this instance, the Democratic members of the conference committee \nwere completely excluded, except for one show-and-tell meeting that was \nheld, a pro forma meeting.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Required by the rules.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Yes. Which had to be done; otherwise, presumably, it \nnever would have happened. All these decisions were made by--and only \nby--the Republican members of the conference committee from the House \nand the Senate.\n  Now, it is an abuse of power, in my opinion. It is another reflection \nof an arrogance of power in terms of how the institution ought to \noperate. I think it is very important to register the point that this \nis what transpired. The American people need to understand that this \nbudget resolution was not the consequence of a give-and-take in the \nnormal legislative way. This was done by the majority simply imposing \ntheir will.\n  Mr. CONRAD. That, in fact, is the case. We were excluded in every \nway. The only time we were included is at the meeting that is required \nby the rules. There is a requirement there be at least one meeting of \nthe conference committee, and we were there. We made our statements. We \nwere ushered out, and that was the end of the conversation. I said I do \nnot think that is the way our Forefathers intended the process to work. \nOne of our colleagues on the other side said: Well, our Forefathers \nnever envisioned political parties. That is true; they did not envision \npolitical parties. But they did envision the abuse of power by a \nmajority. That is one of the things that consumed them in writing the \nConstitution of the United States. They were deeply concerned that a \nmajority would run roughshod over the rights of a minority. They did \nnot see it in terms of political parties. They did see it in terms of \nmajority power and minority rights. This majority has adopted the view \nthat it is only about majority power. That is a mistake. That is not \nwhat the Founding Fathers intended.\n  Here are the results of that kind of mistake. When you look at the \ndeficits, our colleagues say they are going to improve the deficit. But \nin fact, here, as shown on this chart, is a comparison of the budget \nconference report and the deficits it produces compared to what would \nhappen if we put the Government of the United States on autopilot.\n  If we just used the CBO baseline, we would have lower deficits than \nis produced by the work of this conference committee and the majority. \nIn fact, they have increased the deficits by $168 billion over 5 years, \nover the CBO baseline. So they have made the deficits worse by $168 \nbillion in comparison to what would have happened if we would have just \nput the Government on autopilot. When our friends say they are going to \ncut the deficit in half over the next 5 years, here is the strongest \nanswer in factual terms I know of. It is right here. This is the fiscal \nyear 2006 budget resolution from the GOP conference report. This is \ntheir own document, their own calculation, of what is going to happen \nto the debt of the United States each and every year under this budget. \nHere is what it says. It is not my document. This is their document. \nThey say that the debt is going to go up by $683 billion the first \nyear, by $639 billion the next year, by $606 billion the third year, by \n$610 billion the fourth year, by $605 billion the fifth year.\n\n  Where is the deficit cut in half? Where is it? Every year the debt is \ngoing up by over $600 billion. Just visually, on this chart, this is \nwhat we see. They are building a wall of debt. Here is where the debt \nstood, debt subject to limit, and where it will stand at the end of \nthis fiscal year in September. If this budget is adopted--and I pray it \nis not, for the good of this country. For the economic security of \nAmerica, I hope this budget is not adopted. Why? Because it builds a \nwall of debt. Each year, each and every year, the debt climbs by \nanother $600 billion under this budget resolution.\n  Anybody who votes for this budget ought never to again claim they are \nfiscally responsible or fiscally conservative because they are taking \nus on a path of deficits and debt and decline unparalleled in American \neconomic history. That is where this is all headed.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. As this wall of debt is built up, I want to come back \nagain to the carrying cost on that debt. It has to be understood, in \neach annual budget, there is going to be a larger and larger amount to \ncover the interest charge on this expanding debt that is being built up \nyear to year. Furthermore, if we run a risk that other countries are \nnot going to want to hold our paper, as they are doing, we are probably \ngoing to have to raise our interest rates. In fact, interest rates are \nalready on the way up, in any event. If you have to raise them even \nmore, to get others to continue to hold our paper, the carrying charge \nis going to go up.\n  So the carrying charge is going to go up because the debt is going \nup, and it is also going to go up because the interest rates will be \ngoing up. So there will be a double blow dealt to the American economy, \nand a bigger and bigger chunk of each year's budget will be eaten up in \npaying the interest charges on this enormous debt. Isn't that correct?\n  Mr. CONRAD. What is stunning here is who is it going to go to? It \nused to be America financed its own debt; that is, we borrowed the \nmoney from ourselves. Increasingly, we are borrowing the money from \nabroad. Increasingly, we are dependent on the decisions of foreign \ncentral bankers to finance our veracious appetite for foreign capital.\n  The Senator is exactly right. As the debt increases, even if interest \nrates remained unchanged, the interest cost would go up because of the \nincreasing debt, the increasing borrowing that we are doing as a \nnation. On top of that, we know the increasing debt will put pressure \nto increase interest rates because people are going to keep making us \nthese loans, especially when the value of our currency is declining.\n  The only way to offset that is to increase the interest rates. So \nthen you get hit by a double whammy, the double whammy of increased \ninterest because your debt has increased and also it is increased \nbecause interest rates are increasing.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wonder if my colleague, the Senator from \nNorth Dakota, would yield for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I notice on our desks there is something \ncalled the conference report. It is what I asked Senator Conrad about \nearlier today, whether he was aware of what was in the conference \nreport. I guess that was at about noon or 1 o'clock. I believe the \nSenator responded that he\n\n[[Page S4491]]\n\nwas not aware at that point because he had not seen it.\n  But because this is called a conference report, I would ask the \nSenator--you are the ranking member on the Budget Committee here in the \nSenate--were you a part of the conference? Were you a conferee?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Well, I was, in the sense that my colleagues chose me as \na conferee, along with the distinguished senior Senator from Maryland, \nMr. Sarbanes, as well as the senior Senator from Washington, Mrs. \nMurray, but we were not invited to any of the working sessions. We were \nnot invited to any of the negotiations. We were not invited to be any \npart of any of the discussion, other than the one meeting that is \nrequired by rule. It was a public session of the conference committee \nin which we were permitted to make short statements, but we were not \npart of any negotiation or any discussion.\n  (Mr. ALLEN assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. DORGAN. Just to further inquire, you were selected by the Senate \nto be a conferee to this conference but, in fact, were not invited to \nthe conference; is that the fact?\n  Mr. CONRAD. That would be the fact.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me ask the question: I asked midday whether you knew \nwhat was in this conference report, and I well understand now why you \ncould not know if the conferees on this side of the aisle were not \nwelcomed to the conference. In fact, if the conference was held without \nparticipation from the minority party, then I understand this report is \nproduced, in whole, by the majority party. It is a big, thick document \nstuck on our desks maybe midafternoon or late this afternoon.\n\n  I was listening to the debate by my colleague, Senator Conrad, and he \nwas talking about deficits and debt. I thought maybe someone would \nchallenge him on his figures. Wouldn't it be the case that it would be \nhard to challenge your figures because they come from page 4 and page 5 \nof the budget prepared by the majority party? In fact, what it says on \npage 4, which is their conference report--a conference they didn't \nallow the minority to participate in--is that each and every single \nyear, they are going to have massive amounts of deficit spending. And \nthey start with $7.9 trillion of debt on page 4 and end up with $11.1 \ntrillion. Yet they are out here thumbing their suspenders, boasting \nabout how terrific they are at reducing the Federal deficit.\n  Can you show me any place in here where they are reducing the Federal \ndeficit? It looks to me, on page 4 or page 5, they are filling the tub \nwith deficits.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Here it is. This chart shows graphically precisely, \naccording to their numbers--not my numbers; these are their numbers--\nwhat they say their budget will do. It says they are going to increase \nthe debt every year by $600 billion. They say they are going to cut the \ndeficit in half over 5 years, but the debt goes up each and every year \nby over $600 billion. If that isn't doubletalk, I don't know what is. \nThey say the deficit is going down, but the debt is going up. It is \ntheir own calculations. They are building a wall of debt that is \nunprecedented, and they are doing it right before the baby boomers \nbegin to retire, and we all know what that means. They are going to \npresent a future Congress and a future President with the most \nextraordinarily difficult choices that any Congress or any President \nhas faced in this country's history because this is a complete lack of \nfiscal responsibility--deficits on top of deficits on top of debt, up, \nup, and away, no end in sight, and all of it at the worst possible \ntime, before the baby boomers retire.\n  I say to my Republican colleagues: Any Republican colleague who votes \nfor this budget ought to make a pledge here tonight that they will \nnever again claim the mantle of fiscal responsibility, that they will \nnever again claim to be fiscally conservative, because this is a \nborrow-and-spend budget of historic proportion. Our friends on the \nother side of the aisle have decided that the way to win elections is \nto borrow the money and use it to fund tax cuts and use it to fund \nspending and don't worry about anything adding up because they will be \nout of town before the bills come due.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If I may inquire further, isn't it the case that this \nbudget document is actually a budget document that is wearing makeup? \nIf you take the makeup off this document, what does it look like? Let's \nassume they put everything in this document that they know is going to \nhappen. Then what does it look like? As bad as it is now, isn't it the \ncase that this becomes a fiscal catastrophe?\n  Mr. CONRAD. In some ways, it is almost hard to place language on this \ndocument. The Senator says it has makeup. This isn't pretty with or \nwithout the makeup because the results of this are going to be a \ncountry that is deeper and deeper in debt, whose long-term economic \nsecurity is put at risk, that more and more is dependent upon the \ndecisions of foreign central bankers on our economic well-being. The \nharsh reality here is that you can live beyond your means for a while, \nbut it catches up with you. And that is what this budget represents.\n  Our friends on the other side of the aisle want to spend money. Make \nno mistake about that. The spending is going up under this budget. They \njust don't want to pay for their spending. They prefer to borrow the \nmoney. They don't want to raise the taxes necessary to support their \nspending.\n  One could have more respect for their position if they did one of two \nthings: if they either cut their spending to match their willingness to \npay for it by raising revenue or if they were willing to raise the \nrevenue to match their spending appetite. But our friends on the other \nside of the aisle are not willing to do either. They want to spend the \nmoney, but they don't want to raise the revenue to pay for it. Instead, \ntheir answer is, borrow the money. Borrow the money to fund tax cuts. \nTake the money from the Social Security trust fund, $2.5 trillion.\n  They say Social Security is short of money. So what is their answer? \nTheir answer is to take $2.5 trillion out of it to pay for income tax \ncuts that go primarily to the wealthiest among us.\n  Here is the evidence of that because buried in this budget are \nadditional tax cuts, dividends, capital gains that will give on average \nto those who are earning over $1 million a year in our society a \n$35,000 tax cut per year. For those who earn less than $50,000 a year, \nthe vast majority of Americans, they will get $6 a year. This is our \nRepublican friends' notion of a balanced plan--$35,000 a year for those \nwho earn over $1 million a year, $6 for those who earn less than \n$50,000 a year. And for those who are fortunate enough to earn $50,000 \nto $200,000 a year, they would get $112. That is our Republican \nfriends' notion of tax fairness.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The number of people in this country who earn over \n$200,000 a year is less than 1 percent of all taxpayers, is it not?\n  Mr. CONRAD. It is.\n  Mr. SARBANES. It is a tiny group. So this tiny group under this chart \nwill be receiving the overwhelming proportion of this tax cut that is \nincluded in this budget resolution.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Those who earn from $200,000 to $1 million a year get on \naverage $1,480 under the tax cut plan that is contained here. Again, \nthose who earn more than $1 million a year get, just on these tax \nprovisions--by the way, these are just a couple of the tax provisions. \nThis does not include the estate tax provisions that go overwhelmingly \nto the wealthiest among us. Just these two tax provisions would give \n$35,000 a year to those earning $1 million a year and $6 of tax cut to \nthose who earn less than $50,000. It will give $112 to those who earn \nbetween $50,000 and $200,000.\n  I would just say that the priorities of this budget are also out of \nwhack. This budget, in the year 2006, for those fortunate enough to \nearn over $1 million a year, the tax cuts going to that group of people \nwill cost $32 billion in that year alone. That is the cost of the tax \ncuts for those earning over $1 million a year in that year alone: $32 \nbillion. But they say there is not the money to restore the education \ncuts that are contained in this budget which would cost $4.8 billion. \nThey say there is no money to do that. But there is eight times as much \nmoney to give tax cuts to those earning over $1 million a year. I guess \none could say our Republican friends have said: It is seven times as \nimportant to give these tax cuts to those earning over $1 million a \nyear as it is to restore these education cuts.\n\n[[Page S4492]]\n\n  I don't share those priorities. I believe those are misplaced \npriorities. I don't think those are the priorities of the American \npeople. They are profoundly wrong for the long-term economic strength \nof our country.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Is the $32 billion--the cost of the tax cut that goes \nto those making over a million dollars, is that just for 1 year?\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is for 1 year.\n  Mr. SARBANES. So, presumably, in the following year it will cost \nanother $32 billion?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Actually, even more the next year.\n  Mr. SARBANES. That gives you a clear picture of what the priorities \nare in this budget. The priorities are to give $32 billion in tax cuts \nto millionaires, and yet to cut the education programs to almost below \nwhat they were in 2005; is that correct?\n  Mr. CONRAD. It is very hard to understand this set of priorities. The \nSenator is exactly correct. This is the amount this budget would need \nto add to restore education programs to the 2005 level. It would \nrequire $4.8 billion. They say, no, they cannot do that because they \nhave to give $32 billion of tax benefits to those earning over a \nmillion dollars a year. And it is not just with respect to education, \nalthough I argue that education is the clearest priority for our \ncountry. What is it that will allow us to compete in this global world \neconomy? What is it that is going to allow us to compete and win? It is \nhaving the best-educated, the best-trained workforce, and having the \nmost efficient system to disburse the resources we have, to employ them \nin the most competitive and effective way. That is what is going to \nmake us dominant.\n  You can see we are slipping. We are running these massive trade \ndeficits. Does anybody care? Is anybody paying attention? It is not \njust in education. It would cost $1.1 billion to maintain funding for \nlaw enforcement. But, no, they say you have to cut the COPS Program, \nshred the COPS Program. The COPS Program put 100,000 police on the \nstreet and helped reduce crime in this country. They say that has to \ngo, we cannot afford it; but we can afford 30 times as much to give tax \ncuts to those earning over a million dollars a year.\n  A budget is a chance to make choices. That is what it is about. It is \nabout priorities, about what is important. The choices that are being \nmade by our friends on the other side are the choices to add to the \ndebt, add to the deficits, take all the money from Social Security \ntrust fund surpluses--every dime--and use it to pay for other things, \nincluding tax cuts that go overwhelmingly to the wealthiest among us.\n  Are those the priorities of the American people? You know, even \nwealthy people I talk to say these are not their priorities. I have had \nso many wealthy people say to me, ``I don't need another tax cut.'' A \ngentleman stopped me the other day--an enormously wealthy individual--\nand he said: Look, what matters to me is how my country does. I have \nbeen very fortunate. I have done extremely well here. I want others to \nhave the chance I had.\n  That means they have to have a chance to get a good education, and \nthat means our country has to do well. I don't know of a country \nanywhere, ever, that has gotten stronger by becoming more dependent on \nborrowing from other countries. I would like some of our colleagues to \ncome out here and tell me what country became stronger by borrowing \nmore money from foreign countries. Where is it written in history that \na country made itself powerful and strong by borrowing more and more \nmoney from other countries? You know, so many people have warned us we \nare on an unsustainable course. The Comptroller General of the United \nStates warned us we are on an unsustainable course of deficits and \ndebt. The Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board has warned us we are on \nan unsustainable course of deficits and debt. Another thing the \nChairman of the Federal Reserve Board told us is, you ought to \nreinstitute the budget disciplines that helped this country in the \npast, those budget disciplines that apply to both the spending and the \nrevenue side.\n  But this budget doesn't do that. This budget has pay-go provisions \nthat apply on the spending side. Here is what Chairman Greenspan said:\n\n       A budget framework along the lines of the one that provided \n     significant and effective discipline in the past needs, in my \n     judgment, to be reinstated without delay. I am concerned \n     that, should the enforcement mechanisms governing the budget \n     process not be restored, the resulting lack of clear \n     direction and constructive goals would allow the inbuilt \n     political bias in favor of growing budget deficits to again \n     become entrenched.\n\n  He said that in 2003 before the Senate Banking Committee. The \nChairman of the Federal Reserve Board was right about that matter. But \nthat is not what our friends have done here. They have not restored the \nbudget disciplines that worked in the past. No, no. They have taken \nhalf of the formula.\n  The New York Times ran an editorial on Wednesday: ``In Search of \nBudget Moderates.'' I would write a different headline. My headline \nwould be: In Search of People Who Are Fiscally Responsible.\n\n       If you want to spend the money, raise the revenue to pay \n     for it. If you don't have the stomach for raising the revenue \n     to pay for it, cut your spending. Those are the choices that \n     were put before our Republican colleagues. They chose to do \n     neither. They chose instead to run up the debt of this \n     country, which is already at record levels, and they said: \n     Caution to the wind, let's add to the debt $600 billion a \n     year each and every year of this budget. That is what is \n     here. It is their own estimates. It is their own claims about \n     their own budget. It is not somebody else's calculations; it \n     is theirs and they are responsible. They will be held \n     accountable for their votes tonight.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes, I am happy to.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator made a very powerful presentation, as usual. \nThis is an embarrassment--this train wreck of a budget that was brought \nto the floor of the Senate in a manner that excluded the minority party \nfrom participating, in a manner that excluded those who were designated \nas our conferees from participating, brought to the floor the afternoon \nit is to be considered. The only thing that trumps the bad numbers here \nis the bad judgment.\n  A hundred years from now, everybody here will be dead. Historians can \nlook at this and determine what were our priorities, what was important \nin this country to the policymakers, and how they spent the money. This \nis an embarrassment, a train wreck. We are going to have a lot of \ndiscussion about choices and judgment. That is important, the choices \nof: What did we decide to invest in? Who got the tax cuts?\n  That is important. But the bad numbers the Senator has spoken about \nare staggering. I know nobody is going to come to the floor to respond \ndirectly to what he has described because there is no response to it.\n  As I conclude, I will say that some while ago somebody told me you \ndon't understand the economic strategy that is employed here: Don't \nworry about the deficits; spend all this money, and give big tax cuts \nto upper income folks. Katie bar the door. Don't stare problems \ndirectly in the eye; don't deal with them. Let me explain it to you. \nYou take three glasses and one apple. Cut the apple in half and put \none-half in the first glass, put the other half of the apple in the \nsecond glass, and the third half in the third glass. I said: But there \nare only 2 halves.\n  He said: You don't understand our economic strategy.\n  I said: No, I sure don't.\n  That is exactly the basis on which they create a strategy. It is a \nmirage, a total myth. This document pretends to do something it \ndoesn't. It is an embarrassment. The minority was not allowed to come \nto conference, and the majority that is supposed to represent the \nconservative movement in the United States has become the biggest \nspenders in the history of this country and the biggest supporters of \nFederal debt and deficits we have ever seen. And that is in this \ndocument. Do not take it from me, it is not my word, it is in black and \nwhite on page 4 and page 5. I am very anxious tonight for somebody to \ncome down here and describe why and how they got to this point and how \nthey justify it.\n\n  I appreciate the Senator yielding.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a final \nquestion?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes, I will.\n\n[[Page S4493]]\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. The Senator has spoken in a very articulate way about \nfiscal responsibility. My own understanding is, looking back at \nhistory, when we have gone to war, as the President took us to war in \nIraq, we have usually raised taxes to help cover the cost of the war or \nat least cover part of the cost of the war in an effort to be fiscally \nresponsible.\n  In this administration, we went to war and, if I am not mistaken, at \nthe same time the administration was pushing for tax cuts. So we were \nagain being hit doubly. The cost of the war was being imposed on the \nbudget affecting our deficit and debt situation, and at the same time \nthey were seeking tax cuts--in other words, diminishing revenues--which \nalso affected negatively our deficit and debt situation, and that is \ncontrary to fiscal responsibility and contrary to what has happened in \nprevious war engagements; is that not correct?\n  Mr. CONRAD. It is correct. Here we have a situation in which we are \nat war, and we have had very substantial tax cuts already. Last year \nthe revenue was the lowest it has been as a share of gross domestic \nproduct since 1959. The deficits are at record levels. And the \nPresident's answer is spend more money and cut the tax base further, \nexpanding the deficits, expanding the debt, and doing it all right \nbefore the baby boomers start to retire. It is truly a reckless course \nthe President is taking us on. It is a reckless course. I hope at some \npoint colleagues on both sides of the aisle will get serious about the \nlong-term economic security of the country.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts has been extraordinarily patient. Mr. \nPresident, Senator Kennedy has very graciously offered to wait until \nthe Senator from West Virginia has concluded his remarks. We certainly \nthank him for his consideration. I yield such time as the Senator from \nWest Virginia may use.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from North \nDakota and I thank the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts. The \nSenator from Massachusetts has been waiting prior to my arrival on the \nfloor. I have no problem with waiting until he is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his generosity, \nbut I look forward to listening to the Senator from West Virginia. I \nknow we are going back and forth. I ask unanimous consent to proceed \nafter the Senator from West Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator state his request once again? \nThe Chair was unable to hear it.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I was asking for recognition after the Senator from West \nVirginia. I withhold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I say to the Senator from Massachusetts, the \ntime is under the control of the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. How much time would the Senator like?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If I could have a half an hour.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am pleased to yield 30 minutes to the Senator from \nMassachusetts after the Senator from West Virginia has concluded.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, do I have it correct, I will have the \nopportunity for recognition after the Senator from West Virginia?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is correct, and \nthe time for the Senator from Massachusetts is under the control of the \nSenator from North Dakota who stated that after the Senator from West \nVirginia has concluded, the Senator from Massachusetts will have 30 \nminutes to speak on the measure.\n  The Senator from West Virginia has the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I thank again my friend \nfrom Massachusetts. I will try to be brief so that I do not impose on \nthe Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. President, in his book, ``Profiles in Courage,'' John F. Kennedy \nrecalls the tale told by Lucius Quintus Cincinnatus Lamar, a U.S. \nSenator from the State of Mississippi. And I read from John F. \nKennedy's book:\n\n       Lamar, in the company of other prominent military and \n     civilian officers of the Confederacy, was on board a blockade \n     runner making for Savannah harbor. Although the high-ranking \n     officers after consultation had decided it was safe to go \n     ahead, Lamar related, the Captain had sent Sailor Billy \n     Summers to the top mast to look for Yankee gunboats in the \n     harbor, and Billy said he had seen ten. That distinguished \n     array of officers knew where the Yankee fleet was, and it was \n     not in Savannah; and they told the Captain that Billy was \n     wrong and the ship must proceed ahead. The Captain refused, \n     insisting that while the officers knew a great deal more \n     about military affairs, Billy Summers on the top mast with a \n     powerful glass had a much better opportunity to judge the \n     immediate situation at hand.\n\n  ``Profiles'' quotes Senator Lamar:\n\n       Thus it is, my countrymen, you have sent me to the topmost \n     mast, and I tell you what I see. If you say I must come down, \n     I will obey without a murmur, for you cannot make me lie to \n     you; but if you return me, I can only say that I will be true \n     to love of country, truth, and God . . .\n\n  So ends the quote from John F. Kennedy's book, ``Profiles in \nCourage.''\n  Mr. President, I have been to the topmost mast. As the senior member \nof the Appropriations Committee that must implement this budget, as a \nSenator from a State that will suffer under this budget, as a taxpayer \nwho must bear the debt burden of this budget, I see herein calamity, \ntragedy, and callous indifference.\n  Budget deficits, we now know, are not short-term aberrations \nemanating from an economic recession or the attacks of September 11, as \nsome have long maintained. They are the inevitable result--the \ninevitable result--of structural imbalances embedded deep within this \nadministration's failed fiscal policies.\n  From $158 billion 3 years ago, to $375 billion 2 years ago, to $413 \nbillion last year, to $427 billion this year, this administration \nproposes record deficits for today, for tomorrow, and for the \nindefinite future. So this talk about cutting the deficit in half is \nfiction, nothing else but fiction. This budget excludes the long-term \ncosts of military operations in Iraq. It excludes the costs of Social \nSecurity reform.\n  It looks no further than 5 years down the road, effectively \nconcealing the consequences of the administration's proposals for more \ntax cuts. The American people must think Congress is out of its mind to \nbelieve that a budget that proposes such enormous deficits, while \nexcluding so much, could serve as an example of tough decisions. Well \nit ``ain't'' so. Rising deficits suggest just the opposite--an \ninability to make tough decisions. For that matter, cheap shots at \nprograms for the elderly and poor and for rural America hardly \nrepresent tough choices.\n  The administration has been clear that despite the deteriorating \nbudget, it will not sacrifice its political priorities. The sacrifice, \nit insists, must come from others, must come from somebody else, must \ncome from somewhere else; from veterans, who need health care; yes, \nfrom families who cannot afford to heat their homes; yes, from students \nwho require Federal loans; oh, yes, from our police and firefighters \nwho need training and equipment to cope with new dangers.\n  In my State of West Virginia, this budget will result in tens of \nmillions of dollars in cuts for our schools, tens of millions of \ndollars in cuts in nutritional childcare and family services for lower \nincome families. It will eviscerate economic development programs, \nlikely resulting in half a billion dollars in cuts for the State and \nits localities over 5 years. Yes, let them suffer the cuts. It requires \ncuts in Medicaid. It requires cuts in other programs that will deny \naffordable health care to seniors and to families across the States. \nAll together, the cuts included in this budget amount to nickels and \ndimes within the context of the $2.5 trillion budget. They do not fix \nthe deficit problem. Talk about cutting the budget deficit in half, \nthey do not fix the deficit problem. Even with these cuts, this budget \nwill worsen the deficit by $33 billion this year. Think about that. The \nCongress is proposing to cut investments that are essential to the care \nof our seniors, essential to our veterans, essential to our \nschoolchildren, and the result is a $33 billion increase in the budget \ndeficit.\n  Our constituents must wonder for what they are being asked to \nsacrifice. A few simple phrases describe this budget: High deficits and \ndebt, more tax cuts for the wealthy that we cannot afford, more cuts to \nprograms for the elderly, more cuts to programs for veterans, more cuts \nto programs for the schoolchildren, and not a dime to ensure the \nsolvency of the Social Security and Medicare Programs.\n\n[[Page S4494]]\n\n  I think highly of the Senator from New Hampshire. I am very fond of \nhim. I admire him greatly. He has done yeoman's work as chairman of the \nBudget Committee. I cannot support this budget. I defer to that great \nSenator's expertise on many budgetary matters. He is absolutely superb \nas a chairman, but the only right vote that I can see from the topmost \nmasts that I have climbed is a vote against this budget.\n  I again thank my friend from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy. I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I believe I have up to 30 minutes; is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I first want to congratulate the Senator \nfrom North Dakota and my two other colleagues, my old friend and \ncolleague from Maryland, Senator Sarbanes, and Senator Dorgan, for \ntheir excellent presentation in terms of the budgetary impact of this \nbudget.\n  I think they have explained very clearly, eloquently, and \npassionately the severe risks that this budget puts in terms of the \neconomic future of this country and its relationships and dependency on \nother countries throughout the world.\n  I would like to address another aspect of this budget, and that is \nwith regard to domestic priorities that are front and center for most \nfamilies in this country. First, I would like to discuss the priority \nof education, and then, second, the budget cuts in Medicaid, which is a \nlifeline to millions of children and disabled people and women in our \nsociety, and third, the further undermining of our whole pension \nsystem, which has been included as part of this budget as well. We are \nhaving a great national debate on the issues of Social Security and the \nintegrity of the Social Security fund. Under the provisions of this \nbudget, we are going to find that the availability and the assurance of \npensions is going to be seriously undermined and threatened as well.\n  But as an initial matter, I ask unanimous consent that an excellent \nstatement by the Episcopal Church, the Evangelical Lutheran Church, the \nPresbyterian Church, the United Church of Christ, and the United \nMethodist Church, with regard to this budget, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               Washington, DC,\n\n                                                   April 28, 2005.\n\n                   Congress Should Reject This Budget\n\n       In response to the FY 2006 Budget Conference Report to be \n     considered by Congress and as a follow-up to a March 8, 2005 \n     press conference calling the President's FY '06 Budget \n     ``unjust,'' five mainline protestant leaders issued the \n     following statement:\n       On March 8, we as leaders of the Episcopal Church USA, \n     Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, Presbyterian Church \n     (USA), United Church of Christ, and United Methodist Church \n     General Board of Church and Society, issued a joint statement \n     questioning the priorities of President Bush's 2006 Federal \n     Budget. We remembered the Gospel story of Lazarus and the \n     rich man and noted that the 2006 budget had much for the rich \n     man but little for Lazarus. It was our hope that Congress \n     would take action on behalf of ``Lazarus.'' Sadly, all \n     indications are that that has not been the case. Therefore, \n     today we call upon Congress to reject this budget and go back \n     to the drawing boards.\n       We believe our federal budget is a moral document and \n     should reflect our historic national commitment for those in \n     our own country who suffer from hunger, lack of education, \n     jobs, housing, and medical care as well as concern for our \n     global community. There are good programs that can help solve \n     all of these problems. We know, we have seen them at work and \n     we are doing our part with our own programs. But we cannot do \n     it alone. Government must be a partner in providing \n     opportunities for our fellow women and men to pursue their \n     God given gifts. We commend those who attempted to improve \n     the FY '06 budget by adding funds for Medicaid, education, \n     the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, and \n     international family planning. We regret that the speed with \n     which this document is being brought to the floor does not \n     allow time for the careful examination such a document \n     requires.\n       As we view the FY '06 Federal Budget through our lens of \n     faith this budget, on balance, continues to ask our nation's \n     working poor to pay the cost of a prosperity in which they \n     may never share. We believe this budget remains unjust. It \n     does not adequately address the more than 36 million \n     Americans living below the poverty line, 45 million without \n     health insurance, or the 13 million hungry children. \n     Worldwide it neither provides sufficient development \n     assistance nor adequately addresses the Global AIDS pandemic. \n     Therefore, we ask Congress to reject this budget and begin \n     anew.\n       We conclude today, as we did March 8, by asking that \n     together we ``pledge ourselves to creating a nation in which \n     economic policies are infused with the spirit of the man who \n     began his public ministry almost 2,000 years ago by \n     proclaiming that God had anointed him ``to bring good news to \n     the poor.''\n     The Most Reverend Frank T. Griswold,\n       Presiding Bishop and Primate of the Episcopal Church, USA.\n     The Right Reverend Mark Hanson,\n       Presiding Bishop of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in \n     America.\n     The Reverend Dr. Clifton Kirkpatrick,\n       Stated Clerk of the General Assembly, Presbyterian Church, \n     (U.S.A.).\n     The Reverend John H. Thomas,\n       General Minister and President, United Church of Christ.\n     Mr. James Winkler,\n       General Secretary, General Board of Church and Society, \n     United Methodist Church.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will just read a few lines from this statement.\n\n       We believe our federal budget is a moral document and \n     should reflect our historic national commitment for those in \n     our own country who suffer from hunger, lack of education, \n     jobs, housing, and medical care, as well as concern for our \n     global community. . . .\n       As we view the FY 2006 Federal Budget through our lens of \n     faith, this budget, on balance, continues to ask our nation's \n     working poor to pay the cost of a prosperity in which they \n     may never share. We believe this budget remains unjust. It \n     does not adequately address the more than 36 million \n     Americans living below the poverty line, the 45 million \n     without health insurance, or the 13 million hungry children . \n     . . Therefore, we ask Congress to reject this budget and \n     begin anew.\n\n  Mr. President, with a budget we have a chance to make a difference. \nWe have a chance to make a difference for working families and for \nmillions of Americans who work hard every day, who care for their \nfamilies, who want the best for their children, their communities, and \ntheir country. This budget should make a difference for them. It should \nbe a budget for America, a fair budget that improves the lives of \naverage Americans. That is not this budget.\n  President Bush and the Republican Congress had a chance to make a \ndifference and they failed. In this budget, they choose instead to \nlavish more tax breaks on the wealthy at the expense of poor Americans \nwho rely on Medicaid and at the expense of parents who want to send \ntheir children to college. It is Medicaid, strike one; education, \nstrike two; and this budget is strike three. We ought to throw it out.\n  Here is how this budget harms education in America. Education is the \ngolden door to opportunity for our citizens. Parents know that \neducation makes the American dream possible for their children. \nEducation is essential to our future competitiveness and our strength \nas a nation. We cannot compete in the world without skilled workers. We \ncannot maintain a strong defense without a skilled and dedicated \nmilitary.\n  The budget proposed by the President and the Republican leadership in \nCongress fails our future. It fails American families struggling to pay \nfor their children's college education. It fails American workers \nseeking to improve their skills and secure better jobs to support their \nfamilies. It fails our companies looking for the best workers. It fails \nour military looking for the brightest recruits. It weakens America as \nwe strive to compete in the global economy and maintain our security in \na dangerous world.\n\n  American workers are being battered by the tidal wave of \nglobalization and this budget does nothing for them. Nothing. Since \nthis administration has been in office, 2.8 million manufacturing jobs \nhave been lost. By the year 2015, 3.4 million jobs are at risk of being \nsent overseas.\n  This chart demonstrates, according to Forrester Research, one of the \nmost authoritative analytical groups in terms of jobs being outsourced, \nthe job\n\n[[Page S4495]]\n\noutsourcing projections we are facing. Do you think there was any \neffort at all in this budget conference to take into consideration this \nflow line, to be able to take the remedial steps by providing \nadditional skills to our workers, such as training, increasing \nvocational schools, commitment in terms of adult education, continuing \nthe upgrading of our skills? Absolutely not.\n  The wages of average workers are going down at a time when the cost \nof living is going up. At the same time, other nations are producing \nincreased numbers of workers with advanced skills. China, today, is \ngraduating 300,000 engineers; India, 200,000 engineers; the United \nStates of America, 50,000 engineers. Better than half of those foreign \nnationals who graduate in the sciences from American universities are \ngoing back overseas. How are we going to be able to maintain national \nsecurity? How are we going to be able to maintain our economy with \nthese flow lines?\n  Look at what has happened since 1975 with regard to American \nproduction of scientists and engineers. The United States in 1975 was \nthird in the world. The United States today is 15th in the world and we \nare in a downward slide.\n  This Senate said we were going to change that flow line. This Senate \nwent on record by supporting, Republicans and Democrats alike, $5.4 \nbillion to make sure we were going to be able to graduate 50,000 to \n60,000 more engineers and scientists a year.\n  What did this conference do? They said, no, no. Did they say, we will \ngive you 15,000 or 20,000 engineers? No. Or 10,000? No. Or 5,000? No. \nOr 1,000? No. Zero. Effectively, they zeroed that amendment out that \nhad Democratic and Republican support alike not only with regard to \nmath and science but also with regard to the TRIO Program, the Upward \nBound Program, the GEAR UP program, the vocational education program, \nadult literacy programs, all the programs that provide additional \ntraining and help and assistance.\n  For the first time in a decade, this budget cuts the education \nbudget. Page 34 of this budget, two-thirds of the way down, are the \nprojections of 2005 through 2010. It is cutting our education \ncommitment by some $15 billion over the next 5 years--not increasing \nit, not even holding its own--cutting education. Rejecting the Senate \namendment that added $5.4 billion, the conferees instead cut $15 \nbillion in the discretionary education budget.\n  If our country is to remain strong in this rapidly changing world, if \nour economy must work for everyone, every American must have an equal \nchance at the American dream.\n  No Child Left Behind is not just a political slogan; it is a solemn \npledge to every parent and every child in America. But this budget \nleaves 3 million children behind. In 2006, 3 million children are left \nbehind. Remember our commitment, that all children were going to reach \nproficiency over the period of the next 12 years? Under this budget, by \n2013, we will be leaving 4.8 million children behind on the projections \nwe have.\n  This budget cuts student aid, helping young people who would be able \nto go to college. Where do we find that in this budget? In the \nreconciliation part, it talks about $13.6 billion in cuts; $7 billion \nwill come from the student aid program and $6.6 billion will come from \npensions. That means the companies are going to have an increased tax. \nCompanies will have to pay more into the Pensions Benefit Guaranty \nCorporation, big companies and small companies. That will discourage \ncompanies from maintaining their pension programs. That is what the \nadministration wanted.\n  We had offsets for our amendment of $5.4 billion. What were the \noffsets? Closing corporate tax loopholes. Imagine the Republican \nmajority saying all right, Senator Kennedy, maybe you will close the \ntax loopholes you have identified, but not ours. But that is not the \ncase. Those tax loophole closure provisions already had passed \nvirtually unanimously in the Senate previously. The Senate voted for \nthem and then did not use them, did not close them completely \npreviously. Corporate tax loopholes to pay for education and training: \nThat was the choice for the Budget Committee. And they said no to \neducation, no to training, and yes to the corporate loopholes.\n  This budget with regard to education, is important not only for those \nwho are going to college but for those who are trying to make it \nthrough K-12. Every child and every parent ought to understand the \njudgment made at the instigation of the leadership of the Republican \nParty--and this President--to make a reduction of $15 billion in \neducation for the K-12 education; $13 billion in terms of higher \neducation and the pension program; and the elimination of the $5.4 \nbillion. We could have added funding for education. Instead this budget \ncuts education.\n  Money is not everything, but it is a clear indication of a country's \npriorities. What we are talking about with these investments, we were \nenhancing the Pell grant which would be available to 5.3 million young \nAmericans who are qualified, are talented, and able to go to school but \nare having hard times making ends meet, and help and assistance to \nworking families. That is what we were interested in doing. That is \nwhat was turned down.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Would the Senator yield the floor?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Wasn't the money in order not to do this to education \ncontained in the Senator's amendment coming from closing corporate tax \nloopholes that had previously been passed by an overwhelming majority \nin this Senate?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is absolutely correct. That was passed and \naccepted by Republicans and Democrats alike on previous legislation and \nwas never incorporated, never utilized, as we say around here. So there \nhad been an agreement that these were the most egregious loopholes and, \ntherefore, we used that as an offset for the increase of the $5.4 \nbillion in education funding.\n  The conference came back and said, no, we want those loopholes back \nand we are going to cut education for the neediest children, the TRIO \nProgram, the Upward Bound Program, vocational education, and cut back \non scholarship programs for the sons and daughters of working families \nin middle America. That is what is in this budget in education.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Isn't it a dramatic demonstration of a choice in \npriorities, that rather than choosing to fund education, to give young \npeople these opportunities which have been paid for, what they now say \nis, we had to cut the programs because we have a deficit problem?\n  The very able Senator from Massachusetts took that into consideration \nwhen he proposed his amendment because he wasn't going to add to the \ndeficit. He was going to cover the costs of the amendment by closing \nthese egregious loopholes in corporate taxes. They came along and cut \nthe education programs and allowed the egregious tax loopholes to \ncontinue. It is a dramatic demonstration of the priorities of this \nRepublican budget.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I was listening to the Senator's comments earlier about \nthe foreign policy implications of debt. He has been active in areas of \neducation. He knows from his own experience in the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, the Banking Committee, the Joint Economic Committee, what is \nhappening in the other countries.\n  What we saw on the front page of the Washington Post last week was \nthat China was reducing their overall numbers in their military. What \nthey are doing is enhancing their research and development and \neducation and training programs because they are going to go smaller in \nterms of the total numbers of people in the military and go more into \nhigh-tech military equipment which require high level training and high \nskills.\n\n  Would the Senator not agree with me? They are graduating 300,000 \nengineers, and India is graduating 200,000 engineers. And General \nElectric has just moved its top research center over to--where? to \nMaryland or to Massachusetts? no--to India. And DEC, one of the \nleading, innovative companies in this country, has just opened their \nnew research facility, hiring 3,000 Indian engineers. We are not just \nexporting jobs, we are seeing the export of research and technology. \nAnd what is our response? Cutting back on training young Americans and \ngiving more tax breaks to individuals.\n  I say to the Senator, who has been here for years as a member of the \nForeign Relations Committee, isn't he\n\n[[Page S4496]]\n\ntroubled by these flow lines, not only with regard to our national \nsecurity but in terms of our ability to be competitive?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Absolutely. And the Senator from Massachusetts has been \nsounding this clarion call. I make reference to the chart the Senator \nshowed earlier, which shows what is happening in terms of our young \npeople going into math and science and engineering as a percent of the \n24-year-olds who could go into those fields to develop that kind of \ncompetence which we need in the so-called global economy.\n  Now, as I understand this chart, in 1975, the United States was third \nin the world, as shown over on the left side of the chart; is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is----\n  Mr. SARBANES. In 1975, we were third in the world; is that correct?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. We are talking now about math, science, and \nengineering. Everyone talks about technology, the competition we are \nengaged in, and so forth. How do you compete in that world if you do \nnot train the people and have the professionals with the skills to do \nit? We went from being third in the world as to the percentage of our \nyoung people going into math, science, and engineering, to where now, \nas of the year 2000, we are 15th in the world, as I read over on the \nright side of that chart.\n  We have slipped all the way back; there are 14 countries ahead of us \nworldwide in terms of the people they are putting into math, science, \nand engineering.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Well, the Senator is exactly correct. If we think we are \ngoing to have the technological advantage in another 20 years, either \ncommercially or militarily, with these kinds of flow lines, then we are \ndreaming dreams that never will exist. This is absolutely preposterous.\n  We have had an excellent presentation on the overall economic \nimplications of this conference report, but we are talking about the \nhuman investment that makes the difference for us to be No. 1 \ncompetitively, both militarily and commercially.\n  The other point I want to mention to the Senator is that the \nloopholes we closed were the loopholes that were tax incentives for \ncorporations to move jobs overseas. Do we understand? We, as a country, \nare concerned or should be concerned about outsourcing, sending jobs \noverseas. Now we are seeing that not only the jobs are going overseas, \nthe research is going overseas, the education advantage is going \noverseas, the debt control is going overseas. And we are seeing the \nincentives to move those jobs overseas with the tax loopholes we \nclosed.\n  But did the Republican budget conference keep the loopholes closed? \nNo. They restored them. They restored them. They are back, now \navailable to companies to go ahead and outsource American jobs. This is \na performance that just defies reason--we heard over the course of the \ncampaign, which was not all that long ago, how everyone was talking \nabout--Republicans and Democrats--what we were going to do about \noutsourcing. They have given their answer, and they have given it to us \ntonight.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I want to make sure I understand the Senator on this \nvery point. As I understand it, the tax loopholes, or at least some of \nthe tax loopholes the Senator was closing in order to be able to fund \neducation, were incentives or inducements in the Tax Code to encourage \nAmerican corporations to move their investment and operations out of \nthe United States and send them overseas. Is that correct?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That is correct. It is exactly right. And we had those \nagreed on, Republican and Democrat alike. I think it was by 76 votes \nhere in the Senate on the FSC-ETI legislation.\n  So we had the offset of incentives that were moving jobs overseas. We \nwere closing that loophole and investing in able, capable young \nAmericans in higher education, in training teachers for math and \nscience, of which we are in desperate need. No Child Left Behind has \nthe guarantee that we are going to have a well-qualified teacher in \nevery classroom by the year 2006. We are far behind. This would have \ngiven us an opportunity to meet that goal.\n  But most importantly, we would have given the helping hand to many \nother young people in the TRIO Programs and the Upward Bound Programs \nand the rest.\n  Mr. President, over 160 organizations representing students and \neducators supported our amendment. They generated thousands of calls to \ntheir legislators. Just in Massachusetts, I received more than 1,000 \nletters from adult education students and teachers urging that this \namendment be retained, telling their stories about how adult education \nis changing their lives for the better. We have letters from colleges \nand universities across the country urging Congress to increase the \nPell grants, to save the Perkins Loans Program. We have letters from \nstudents, counselors, and young adults urging us to save college \npreparation programs for first-generation students, such as TRIO and \nGEAR UP. Over 600,000 students have sought more information about this \namendment.\n\n  On their own, five Republican Senators wrote the budget conference \ncommittee to tell them this President should support this amendment and \nthe conference committee should support this amendment, and that the \neducation and Pell grants needed their support. Yet this conference \nrejected all those pleas and cut education.\n  Now, the Republican leadership and the White House decided it was \nmore important to maintain the loopholes to reward corporations that \nsend jobs overseas rather than invest in our own young people here at \nhome.\n  Our amendment embraced the hopes and dreams of millions of Americans. \nAll parents want their children to have lives of fulfillment and \nopportunity, to raise strong and healthy families, and afford to live \ncomfortably in safe neighborhoods.\n  When we first debated this resolution a little over a month ago, a \nmajority in the Senate said no to the President's cuts in education. \nToday, a majority of the Senate should say no again. We should stop the \nraid on student aid and pass a budget that strengthens, not weakens, \nAmerica.\n  Now, Mr. President, on another subject, just last month the Senate \nmade it clear that cuts to the Medicaid Program were unacceptable. In a \nbipartisan vote, we agreed to not make any cuts until a bipartisan \ncommission had time to examine the Medicaid Program and recommend \npossible reforms based on sound policy. Just this week, in an \noverwhelming, bipartisan vote, the House instructed the budget \nconferees not to cut Medicaid.\n  Yet the budget we will be voting on shortly not only cuts Medicaid--\ndespite consensus in both the House and Senate against cuts--its cuts \nto the program are almost as deep as those we voted down in March. The \nSenate rejected the $15 billion in cuts to the Finance Committee. Yet \nthis budget report that was drafted in the dark of night behind closed \ndoors forces the Finance Committee to cut $10 billion.\n  If these cuts were not bad enough, the bipartisan Medicaid Commission \nhas turned into a partisan commission that the administration can stack \nwith members they know will recommend the cuts they have determined. \nInstead of a real examination of the Medicaid Program so that we can \nmodernize the program with needed reforms, we will have a commission \nwhose agenda will be to recommend cuts.\n  It is not just Medicaid that is at risk. What does it say about \nRepublican priorities if this Republican budget cuts a program that \nprovides health care for 53 million low-income Americans--children, \nparents, the elderly, and the disabled--in order to provide large, new \ntax cuts for the wealthy?\n  Republicans say they are for a culture of life, but Medicaid sustains \nthat life. One-third of all the births in America are covered by \nMedicaid. Medicaid sustains life for a third of our mothers and our \nbabies. But this budget says the lives of poor mothers and poor \nchildren are not that important after all. Under this budget, tax \nbreaks for the rich are more important than life itself.\n\n  I want to show you what has happened with regard to low-income \nchildren. Since 1997, 23 percent of children in America were not \ncovered. Now we have reduced that to 15 percent. We are making very \nimportant progress in terms of providing some insurance for\n\n[[Page S4497]]\n\nchildren. But now with this budget, we are going to see this line go \nback up because of the following.\n  If you look at this chart, you will see what is happening to children \nand also to low-income parents. The total number of low-income children \nhas increased by 6.7 percent and 5.5 percent in terms of low-income \nparents who have lost their health insurance. We have seen a 1.7-\npercent growth in the Medicaid Program and an increase of 8 percent to \ncover low-income children. So we are making some progress, but not with \nthis budget.\n  This budget takes away those gains for children. Take them away from \nthe elderly. Take them away from the services for expectant mothers who \nare delivering. That is what this budget does, and that is what is so \nincredibly wrong in terms of this budget.\n  We know the harmful consequences of the lack of access to health \ncare. In the early 1960s, President Kennedy commissioned a study to \nfind out why half of our young military draftees were rejected for \nservice. The study, which was released in 1964 and provided the basis \nfor Medicaid coverage policy for children, found these young men had \nphysical and mental developmental problems that were highly treatable \nif they had had access to health care as children. As a result, the \nMedicaid program was set up. That is the basis for it. And we have made \nenormous progress. Now we are going to see the undermining of that \nprogram.\n  Finally, Mr. President, the budget also includes a reserve fund for \nthe Grassley-Kennedy bill to provide health coverage for families with \ndisabled children. The bill is titled the ``Family Opportunity Act.''\n  For the last 5 years, Senator Grassley and I have been fighting to \nget this legislation passed.\n  The Family Opportunity Act allows families of children with severe \ndisabilities to buy health care coverage under the Medicaid program, \nwithout becoming poor, staying poor, or giving up custody of your \nchild. It is legislation cosponsored by more than half of the United \nStates Senate and over 200 disability, health care and other \norganizations.\n  Almost one in ten children in America has significant disabilities. \nBut many do not have access to even the most basic health services they \nneed because the private health insurance won't cover them.\n  In every one of these plans you read numerous exclusions that hurt \nchildren with disabilities--no coverage for hearing aids, for special \nhealth needs, for assistive technology, for services at school, and on \nand on and on.\n  These families aren't looking for a hand-out--just a helping hand. \nAll they want is the opportunity to buy affordable coverage, because \nthe private health insurance market won't offer it to them.\n  More than any other investment we can make in this budget, we should \nsecure funding for these families who struggle everyday to afford the \nhealth care their children need to live healthy and successful lives.\n  I hope that we can finally see this profamily bill enacted into law \nthis year.\n  The budget sets up a reserve fund for Senate action to bring the \nbenefits of information technology to our inefficient health care \nsystem. Unfortunately, a similar reserve fund is not available for \nHouse action.\n  Information technology has revolutionized virtually every industry in \nAmerica--only health care lags behind.\n  IT is critical to our efforts to bring costs down and improve \nquality. It can provide for more efficient delivery of care, and it can \nreduce errors and increase quality. HHS estimates that widespread use \nof IT can save as much as $140 billion a year.\n  The VA has implemented the most advanced IT system in the country \nover the past few years. The results have been remarkable. Since 1996, \nVA costs per patient have actually decreased 7 percent, while private \nsector costs per patient have increased by 62 percent. During this \nperiod, the VA has been widely recognized for improving its quality of \ncare.\n  Obviously, not all of these successes have been due to information \ntechnology--but the VA system thinks that much of it has.\n  We have a tremendous opportunity to improve the ability of IT to make \na real difference in the quality and efficiency of health care--but we \nhave to act now.\n  I commend Senator Gregg and Senator Conrad for working with the \nchairman of our Health Committee, Senator Enzi, and me as well as \nSenator Grassley and Senator Baucus on the Finance Committee--to \ninclude this fund in the budget.\n  The fund is a small step in the right direction, but it will be a \nwasted step unless Congress enacts legislation to improve the use of \nhealth IT in America.\n  The two key components of any legislation, in my view are incentives \nfor hospitals and health care providers to use IT to improve quality \nand in acquiring IT. Part of this effort is developing technical \nstandards in partnership with the private sector to ensure that the \nmoney is spent on systems that really enhance quality.\n  Our economic competitors in Europe and elsewhere are making the \ninvestments needed to improve their health IT systems. The British are \ninvesting over $15 billion, yet we in this country continue to delay.\n  IT can cut costs in many ways. Our fragmented and uncoordinated \nhealth care system imposes high costs in duplication and waste. \nPatients with multiple chronic illnesses see as many as fourteen \ndoctors a year.\n  Doctors repeat tests that have already been performed. Residents take \nhistories that have already been taken. Patients show up for doctors' \nappointments that are essentially a waste of time because tests have \nbeen performed but the results have not been delivered.\n  It has been estimated that one in seven hospitalizations could be \navoided if complete medical records were available for the patient. One \nout of five laboratory tests are duplicative of ones that have already \nbeen performed. This adds up to immense amounts of money. IT can reduce \nthis needless duplication.\n  We as a nation cannot afford to miss this opportunity to make the \ninvestments needed to improve health care and cut costs.\n  My time is about up, but I must comment on how this budget resolution \nalso attacks our defined benefits system. Pensions are more important \nthan ever. We know of the assault that is on the very nature Social \nSecurity. Separate from Social Security, the number of secured, defined \nbenefit plans is going down. This particular budget increases the \npremium tax on employers with a heavy burden on manufacturing \ncompanies. It will hurt small businesses. These premium increases will \nobviously hurt many workers and retirees, and it will also jeopardize \nlong-term retirement stability. Pensions are important. They are a part \nof the quality of life for working American families. This budget does \na disservice for them as well.\n  I hope this budget will be rejected.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, as I understand the Senator from North \nDakota, Senator Sarbanes wishes to speak for 10 minutes. I would \nsuggest that Senator Sarbanes speak for 10 minutes, then we to go \nSenator Grassley for 15 minutes, then we go to Senator Stabenow; \nhowever you want. We will go back to your side for a half or so, and \nthen we will come back over here. The next speaker on our side, after \nwe go from Senator Sarbanes to Senator Grassley to--\n  Mr. CONRAD. Actually, we have Senator Akaka and then Senator \nStabenow.\n  Mr. GREGG. We may want to put Senator Hutchison between Senators \nAkaka and Stabenow. But if not, we will go with that sequence.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Can I suggest that Senator Hutchison had indicated to \nstaff she would be more interested in a little later time slot.\n  Mr. GREGG. Yes, around 9. But I assume we will hit that hour by that \ntime.\n  Mr. CONRAD. If we went to Senator Akaka for 10 minutes and then \nSenator Stabenow for 15, we would then be very close to 9 o'clock.\n  Mr. GREGG. Why don't we plan to do it that way. Then move to Senator \nHutchison. With that being the general lay of the land, let's proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I commend my very able colleague from\n\n[[Page S4498]]\n\nMassachusetts for a very powerful statement about the priorities in \nthis budget. He is absolutely right.\n  The budget resolution is the single most important document we deal \nwith in the Congress because it contains within it thousands of \ndecisions that are critical to our national life, all of which reflect \nour choices about priorities.\n  As the Senator pointed out, this budget resolution makes it a \npriority to keep tax loopholes for large corporations, many of which \ninduce them to send jobs overseas, rather than closing those \nloopholes--which have been overwhelmingly supported by the Senate, both \nRepublicans and Democrats--in order to fund education. It is a clear \nexample of the wrong set of priorities. I thank the Senator, first for \nhis leadership in the Senate which got that amendment adopted, which \nwould have done something for education in this country, and for \narticulating so well what is at stake here as we move ahead.\n  The budget presents very fundamental questions to us. What do we \nestablish as priorities? Which programs are important? How do we \nbalance programs with tax cuts, with deficit reduction? In my view, \nthis budget does not reflect the right answers. It contains substantial \ncuts in a number of important domestic programs, including Medicaid, \neducation, affordable housing--the list goes on and on.\n  The justification for these cuts is that we have a deficit problem to \ndeal with. If you ask, why are you cutting these programs which we so \ndesperately need, the answer that is given is: Well, we have a big \ndeficit.\n  But the question that needs to be asked and understood is: Where did \nthis deficit come from to begin with? When President Bush came into \noffice in 2001, he inherited a surplus in the Federal budget. The \nprojection was that we would run a $5.6 trillion surplus over the next \n10-year period. Those were the projections.\n  In his first budget proposal, which included, in my view, an \nexcessive tax cut, primarily for those at the top of the income scale, \nhe said: We can proceed with tax relief without fear of budget \ndeficits. That is what the President said: We can proceed with tax \nrelief without fear of budget deficits.\n  The following year, with the budget already in deficit, having moved \nfrom surplus to deficit, the President advocated for another tax cut \nwhile promising, and I quote him:\n\n       Our budget will run a deficit that will be small and short-\n     term.\n\n  In fact, the President's budget that year stated that deficits would \nbe so short-term that by today, by now, the Government would be back in \nsurplus. How wrong he was.\n  Instead of the $5.6 trillion 10-year surplus projected when the \nPresident took office, the projections now are for a deficit over the \nsame period of $3.7 trillion. When you factor in, as my able colleague \nfrom North Dakota stated earlier in the debate, some of the costs we \nknow are coming, such as the continuing cost of the war in Iraq, the \ncost of reforming the alternative minimum tax, the cost of some of the \nPresident's proposals to make tax cuts permanent, that is a \ndeterioration in our fiscal position of over $9 trillion.\n  There are a number of reasons for this fiscal reversal. Spending to \nrecover from the attacks of September 11, to pay for operations in Iraq \nand Afghanistan have played a part. But the deficits are not primarily \nthe result of increased spending by the Congress. By far the greatest \nfactor contributing to the return of deficits and these disastrous \nprojections is on the revenue side, and the primary reason on the \nrevenue side is the President's tax cuts.\n  We are now living with the consequence of those tax cuts: deficits \nand debt as far as the eye can see. The architects of this budget claim \nthat to deal with these deficits, we must have serious cuts in domestic \nprograms. At the same time these serious cuts in education, health \ncare, and housing are being made, this budget resolution contains \nbillions of dollars in additional tax cuts for the wealthiest \nAmericans. In fact, as my able colleague from North Dakota, Senator \nConrad, pointed out, in 2006 alone, the President's tax cuts are \nscheduled to give $32 billion to those making over $1 million a year. \nSo for millionaires, there is going to be $32 billion in tax cuts in \n2006.\n  The New York Times, in an editorial earlier this week, recognized \nthat this budget is skewed toward the wealthy. Let me quote from that \neditorial:\n\n       Congress is likely to approve a budget blueprint this week \n     that manages to be profligate and mean-spirited at the same \n     time. . . . It calls for generous tax cuts for investors, who \n     hardly need more help, and for harsh spending cuts for the \n     needy, who certainly do.\n\n  The Times hoped there would be pressure on the drafters of this \nbudget sufficient to ``inject some common sense and human kindness into \nthe process.''\n  Regrettably, that appears to have been a vain hope. This budget \nresolution contains $70 billion in tax cuts that are given fast-track \nprocedural protection at the same time there are very deep cuts in a \nnumber of domestic programs.\n  There are those who seek to defend the spending cuts by saying that \nthey are necessary in order to rein in the deficit. I want to say to \nthem that these cuts are not about reducing the deficit; these cuts are \nabout making room for tax breaks for wealthy people.\n  As the Washington Post reported, ``the cost of those tax cut \nextensions would more than nullify the savings from the spending \ncuts.'' Let me repeat that. ``The cost of those tax cut extensions \nwould more than nullify the savings from the spending cuts.''\n  There are Medicaid cuts--so important to providing health care for \nour people--and education cuts, which set us back in the effort to fund \nour schools and undertake educational initiatives, which may well be \nthe best investment America can make in its future strength.\n  We are failing to face up to the global competition in which we find \nourselves, and we are making choices in this budget that are directly \ncontrary to strengthening our economy and strengthening our Nation. \nMake no mistake about it, the argument that is made that we must cut \nthese programs that are so essential to our people in order to address \nthe deficit misses entirely the point that room is being made in this \nbudget for further tax cuts for very wealthy people.\n  So the choice of priorities is the tax cuts on the one hand--more tax \ncuts, excessive tax cuts, for the very top of the income scale on the \none hand--and cutting back on education and health care, the \nenvironment, and housing. As the Post pointed out and I quoted, the \ncost of those tax cut extensions would more than nullify the savings \nfrom the spending cuts.\n  These are the wrong priorities, the wrong choices. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote against this disastrous budget resolution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has been accorded 15 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I first compliment the chairman of the \ncommittee, Senator Gregg, for his outstanding work in getting a budget \nbefore the Senate because that didn't happen last year. I am so glad we \nhave a budget because it is discipline for the Congress, and anybody \nknows, when it comes to spending money, Congress needs discipline. So I \nurge my colleagues to support this conference report.\n  Of course, a budget resolution is more or less a blueprint. It sets \nthe overall level of spending and also for revenue of the Federal \nGovernment. The budget itself does not change any law. As I said, it is \na blueprint, ground rules, for all of the other spending and revenue \nlegislation that will be considered in the Senate yet this year.\n  Under the Senate rules, any bill that exceeds the level set in the \nbudget may be subject to a point of order that would require a 60-vote \nsupermajority. That is where the discipline comes--when people want to \nspend more money without raising taxes or taking the money from some \nother program, then they would be beyond the budget, and consequently a \npoint of order could be raised. It is very difficult to get a 60-vote \nsupermajority in this body. Consequently, it keeps spending within the \nbudget. So it is budget discipline that Congress needs.\n  By imposing the supermajority requirement, the budget encourages the \nSenate to stay within these overall limits that are in the document we \nare going to vote on tonight, while at the\n\n[[Page S4499]]\n\nsame time providing the opportunity to exceed those limits if a \nsupermajority can be gotten. And when there are extenuating \ncircumstances, you have to assume extenuating circumstances get that \nsort of a vote in the Senate.\n  The annual budget process is often the subject of much controversy, \nas I think you can tell from the debate tonight. I want to take a \nmoment and focus on a number of specific provisions as they relate to \nthe committee that I chair, the Senate Finance Committee, which has the \nresponsibility for all of the legislation that affects Medicaid and \nMedicare, as well as everything dealing with the raising of taxes or \nthe decreasing of taxes involved with the income tax code.\n  The budget resolution conference report provides reconciliation \ninstruction--in other words, mandating that the Finance Committee, like \nit mandates other committees to do similar things in their \njurisdiction, to achieve $10 billion in program savings and $70 billion \nin tax relief.\n  While these instructions do not actually require the Finance \nCommittee to enact any specific policy--that is our option how we meet \nthese goals--there are a number of policies that are assumed and I \nthink realistic within the numbers that are provided in the budget \nresolution.\n  The budget provides for $10 billion in savings from the Finance \nCommittee, and I surely and confidently commit the Finance Committee to \nmake every effort to work in a bipartisan fashion where we keep in mind \nprinciples that guide us in producing a better Medicaid Program.\n  The Finance Committee will look at proposed savings that will be \nshared equally--I should not say equally but shared proportionately \nbetween the Federal Government and the States because the Medicaid \nProgram is a Federal-State partnership.\n  States are in trouble. We want to help them. We want to emphasize \nflexibility for the States through voluntary options that States can \nexercise to get more bang for the Medicaid dollar and even save money \nin the process, maybe in some instances, through flexibility, even \nserving a larger population than they now serve but with a more \nefficient expenditure of that money. The Finance Committee will do this \nwhile making a commitment not to eliminate coverage for Medicaid \nbeneficiaries.\n  I look forward to taking action to improve Medicaid. Doing nothing is \nfar worse for Medicaid. If we do not eliminate wasteful practices, if \nwe do not provide States with this necessary flexibility, if we do not \nprovide States the relief they are asking for, they are simply going to \ncut whole groups of people off the rolls to make their budget ends meet \nwithin their State legislative prerogative.\n  I recall reading in the paper a couple of months ago, I think it was \nthe State of Mississippi found itself in a position where it could not \nafford everything the Federal Government mandated on Medicaid, and they \njust dropped 55,000 people from the rolls. They should not have to do \nthat, they do not want to do that, and we can help them not to do that \nby giving more flexibility to the States.\n  That is why I say doing nothing is far worse for Medicaid \nbeneficiaries than what we are going to attempt to do in the next few \nmonths through this reconciliation instruction to provide a rational, \nreasoned approach to protecting and strengthening the Medicaid Program. \nThat is what we will do in meeting our instructions.\n  I am going to leave Medicaid now and go to the tax relief portions in \nthis budget and comment on two aspects: The amount of relief for the \nbudget period--that is the next 5 years--and the use of reconciliation \nto bring about the tax relief that a majority of this Senate is going \nto say we need.\n  Before I start with the numbers, I want to put in context the revenue \nside of the budget. Some have argued, and particularly we have heard \nthis even tonight, that bipartisan tax relief has gutted the revenue \nbase permanently, and that is hogwash. They argue that this change is a \nreason to raise taxes. People want to raise taxes, can you believe \nthat, Mr. President, instead of not extending the tax relief that was \nvoted in 2001, 2003, and I guess some in 2004?\n  The facts, according to the Congressional Budget Office--and \nremember, they work for everybody, Republicans and Democrats; they are \nnot Republican or Democrat, they are professionals. Their statistics \nshow otherwise.\n  I want to put a chart up and have my colleagues concentrate on \nCongressional Budget Office data, and this covers the period of time \nfrom 1960 to 2015, so we get a historical response to people who are \nsaying we have permanently gutted the tax base.\n  This chart shows the volatility of revenue and its relationship to \neconomic performance. When we suffer economically--and that is the \ngreen line on the chart--as related to the ups and downs in the growth \nof the economy, the gross domestic product, it shows that we suffered \neconomically. You can see the red lines going up and down being revenue \ncoming into the Federal Treasury in relationship to the growth or the \nsinking of the economy over this historical period of time. Then we \nalso see when the economy grows, revenues go up. When the economy \nsinks, obviously, revenue coming into the Federal Government goes down.\n  We have heard so much about what this administration has done to the \nrevenue base of the country. What we see in the first 4 years of the \nBush administration--so you have to look at the years 2001 to 2005--you \nwill remember we inherited a recession. I hope people on the other side \nof the aisle realize that the NASDAQ lost 50 percent of its value in \nthe year 2000. I hope people remember that this economy started in a \nrecession 3 months before President Bush was ever sworn in for the \nfirst time. So the bubble broke. We had those corporate scandals that \ndate back to the midnineties becoming public in the year 2001. And then \nwe can see from the chart that the uptick in the economy started late \nin the Bush administration and continues today.\n  The Congressional Budget Office shows, as we can see, revenue is \ncoming back. So let's not confuse cause and effect. The tax reduction \nwe voted on in 2001 and 2003 has helped the economy recover and the \nFederal Treasury is benefiting. So we have to look at what is projected \nout, starting this year and into the future.\n  We see the economy fairly stable for the next few years, and we see \nthe revenue base high above the growth of the economy. So let's be \nclear, undertaxation of the American people is not the source of our \nbudget problems. And all the people over here who think we ought to \nraise taxes, I wonder when they have their town meetings how many \npeople in their town meetings say: I am undertaxed; I want to pay more \ntaxes. I do not have people coming to my town meeting saying that. I \nthink what the American people are saying is that Congress overspends, \nand this budget is all about discipline in spending. Undertaxation, I \nhope my colleagues understand over there, is not the source of our \nproblems.\n  Now, let's start with a basic number. When the Senate Budget \nCommittee considered the resolution a few weeks ago, Republicans laid \nout our plan for reconciled tax relief. This plan was a product of \ndiscussion with members of the Republican caucus, just like I presume \nthe Democrats have discussions about tax policy among their people.\n  Our objective now is to preserve current law, levels of tax relief \nthat were voted in 2001 and 2003, and anybody who says you should \neliminate the tax cuts of 2001 and 2003, they are not saying eliminate \nthe tax cuts, they are saying raise your taxes. That is what they are \nsaying.\n  Our plan centers on a seamless extension of tax relief provisions \nthat began in 2001. It is critical that these provisions be \nrationalized in a commonsense way. Assuring taxpayers of the continuity \nof promised tax benefits should be one of our highest priorities.\n  Taxpayers should not face a reversal of the level of tax relief we \nhave delivered. Certainty of tax policy is absolutely necessary for \neconomic growth, and economic growth is absolutely necessary for \ncreating jobs. This objective is critical with respect to the widely \napplicable provisions dealing with capital gains and dividends, small \nbusiness expensing, low-income savings, the alternative minimum tax, \nand college tuition deductibility.\n  Do those people over there who say we ought to eliminate the tax cuts \nof\n\n[[Page S4500]]\n\n2001 and 2003 think we ought to eliminate the college tuition \ndeductibility? I do not think so. But that is where they would take us. \nMillions of taxpayers from all walks of life have come to rely upon \nthese tax relief provisions, and they are going to expire if we do not \ndo something about it. They are going to get an automatic tax increase \nwithout even a vote of Congress if we do not do something. We should \nhave guts enough to vote for tax increases if we want to, not just sit \nidly by and let taxes go up.\n  Some on the other side have been critical of the $70 billion in \nreconciled tax relief that is in this budget resolution, as was Social \nSecurity reform. At my hearing this week we heard a lot of complaining \nabout so-called Social Security reform, but we do not get a lot of \nanswers from the other side on Social Security or on taxes. We do not \nget problem solving. We do not get any constructive dialogue.\n  Where is the Democratic plan for tax relief? Has anyone seen it? All \nwe hear are criticisms. How many times have we heard about AMT? Answer: \nWe have heard we ought to be doing something about AMT plenty of times. \nThere is an AMT problem. I have a couple of charts that tell the story. \nI would like to have my colleagues look at the baseline.\n  I ask unanimous consent for an additional 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator from Iowa is \nallotted an additional 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I want my colleagues to look at the baseline. We can \nsee the orange line. That is the individual taxes based on historical \naverage.\n  The AMT is part of the individual income tax. Historically, \nindividual income taxes have been at about 8 or 9 percent. That is the \nred line. The AMT and the regular tax balloon proportionately, under \ncurrent law, over the next 40 years is going to go up very \ndramatically. This balloon effect is due to the sunset of bipartisan \ntax relief and AMT.\n  Now let us focus a little bit closer. Let us look at the next chart. \nThis chart shows that extension of the bipartisan tax relief still \nleaves individual taxes at record levels. The blue line shows \nindividual taxes are going to be growing very dramatically. The chart \nalso shows that fixing the AMT leaves individual income taxes at record \nlevels, as we can see from the orange line. What we can see is we \nseriously do have an alternative minimum tax problem and fixing it will \nnot gut the revenue base over the long term. It is common sense that an \nunfair tax such as the alternative minimum tax, that is out of control, \nshould be fixed without regard to offsets.\n  Common sense plays out on the budget side as well. We have even heard \nincorrect assertions that this budget does not address the alternative \nminimum tax problem. Well, guess what. In this budget, there is room \nfor extending the current patch or hold harmless for millions of \nfamilies facing an alternative minimum tax.\n  We hear all about the fact that the budget does not have anything to \ndo with the alternative minimum tax. Well, it does. I just said it \ndoes. It is part of it. But where is the Democratic plan for \nalternative minimum tax relief? Where is the response for even the \ncurrent period we are talking about in this budget? I have been looking \nfor a Democratic plan and I cannot find it.\n  This budget contains plans for tax relief. The reconciliation \ninstructions give us the resources to maintain current law tax relief. \nPut another way, the reconciliation instruction is our best means to \nprotect against the tax hike automatically foisted upon millions of \nAmerican taxpayers.\n  Now I turn to the second aspect of the tax relief portion of the \nbudget. We will hear a lot of criticism against the use of \nreconciliation for tax relief. It was not an easy choice. I prefer \nregular order in the Senate, but recent tax legislative history in the \nSenate suggests that the reconciliation option is an important tool to \nhave at our disposal.\n  With partisan obstructionism on the part of Democratic leadership, \nmany regular order tax relief packages over the last 2 years have been \nstalled in the Senate. Even tax relief packages that the Democrat \nleadership claims to support encounter that sort of partisan \nobstructionism.\n  Members will recall that several cloture votes were required to get \nthe bipartisan FSC/ETI legislation through the Congress last October. \nLikewise, we were unable to go to conference with the House on the CARE \nAct and other popular tax relief packages because of Democratic \nleadership objections. The situation has only become worse this year. \nThe climate may still be more difficult if the Democratic leadership \nacts on the threats they have talked about of shutting down the Senate \nif the controversy over judicial nominations is brought to the \nforefront. From a practical standpoint, there is a significant risk \nthat reconciled tax relief may be the only tax relief vehicle that can \npass the Senate in this environment. I hope that is not the case. It is \nprudent to consider a possibility. Because of this hostile partisan \nenvironment, a reconciliation bill may be the only known path to \npreserve the tax relief provided during the last 4 years. For this \nreason, our caucus viewed the reconciliation numbers as a comprehensive \nblueprint for preserving current law levels of tax relief.\n  There is $36 billion of tax relief for regular order tax relief we \nwill have to offset. This amount is meant to cover packages such as a \ncomprehensive energy bill.\n  What it comes down to is this: We need to take care of legislative \nbusiness. We need to continue the tax relief promised to the American \npeople, but we are better off with a plan that prevents tax hikes. I am \npleased we have this plan.\n  Once again, I urge my colleagues to support the budget resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized for a \nperiod of 10 minutes.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition to the \nconference report for the fiscal year 2006 budget resolution and \nassociate my remarks with those of many of my colleagues. My reasons \nstart with missed opportunities and misplaced priorities, added to \nfiscal irresponsibility. I could support this measure if it provided \nenough funding for education, for veterans, for health care, for law \nenforcement. But it fails in many ways in these areas and, instead, \ngives priority to tax cuts largely for the well-off. It also masks the \nfull story by leaving out recent war costs, estimated costs for the \nPresident's reform plan for Social Security, and costs for fixing the \nalternative minimum tax that is extending into the middle class.\n  It is terrible that the conference report includes reconciled tax \ncuts of $70 billion that will drive our Nation further and further into \ndebt. Moreover, it is dismaying that these tax cuts would be funded at \nthe expense of working families. Health care costs are increasing. Our \nhealth care providers are confronted with inadequate reimbursements, \nrising costs, and an increasing demand to provide care for the \nuninsured. I have met with many of my own constituents, particularly \ndoctors, nurses, and administrators, who have conveyed to me their deep \nconcerns with their ability to continue to provide treatment for \nMedicare and Medicaid beneficiaries because the reimbursement costs are \nso low. The providers are unable to adequately meet their costs of \nproviding care to beneficiaries.\n  The reductions in Medicaid included in the budget resolution will \nlead to further cuts in coverage and benefits for people without other \nhealth insurance. The cuts will prevent individuals from being able to \naccess health care, which will increase the burden on our public health \nsystem. The Medicaid cuts will further erode the ability of hospitals, \nclinics, physicians, and other medical providers to meet the health \ncare needs of our communities.\n  Medicaid programs are demanding a larger share of State spending than \nthey have in recent years. Reducing the Federal commitment to Medicaid \nwill push additional costs to the States and increase the number of \npeople who are uninsured or underinsured. Shifting the burden of \nproviding essential health care services to States and to providers is \nirresponsible. We need to work together to slow health care costs, but \nnot by cutting programs on which so many people depend.\n  Medicaid is an essential part of the public safety net in my State, \nwhere Medicaid and QUEST provided essential health services to nearly \n190,000 people in 2002. QUEST is Hawaii's Medicaid expansion program \nthat provides\n\n[[Page S4501]]\n\nhealth coverage through managed care plans for eligible lower-income \nresidents. Medicaid is an essential part of the health care safety net \nin all of our States. Denying treatment to people in need to support \nmore reckless tax cuts for the wealthy is a significant mistake. Cuts \nin Medicaid and other programs, such as Medicare, will cause real pain \nto real people.\n  I am deeply frustrated that we are no longer able to move legislation \nforward that expands access to health care. Instead, access is being \nreduced through poorly thought out arbitrary cuts that will have \ndetrimental effects on working families across the country.\n  The conference report also fails veterans. VA hospitals and clinics \nare already in difficult financial straits. Hospitals are millions of \ndollars in the red. Outdated medical equipment cannot be replaced. \nNursing home beds are being closed. And large groups of veterans are \nbeing denied care. If the level of funding included in the budget \nresolution comes to fruition, things will continue to deteriorate.\n\n  It is abundantly clear that VA needs an additional $2.8 billion more \nthan it was provided last year. The conference report does not include \nthis level of funding. I remind my colleagues that payroll and \ninflation increases for doctors, nurses, and medications cost more than \n$1 billion.\n  Simply maintaining current services may not be enough to ensure that \nVA can meet the health care needs of veterans. Chronic illnesses of our \naging veterans population and newly recognized challenges--such as the \nneed to shape new programs for veterans affected by hepatitis C--will \nfurther strain VA's resources. We must anticipate increased and \nchanging demands for treating complex diseases, such as hepatitis C, \nand ensure that veterans with multiple, overlapping medical problems \nreceive all the treatment that they need. Additionally, we must be \ncertain that VA has the resources it needs to care for those \nservicemembers returning from Operations Iraqi and Enduring Freedom. \nThis became all the more important when the Senate rejected my \namendment to add funding for VA to the war supplemental.\n  The budget resolution does nothing to provide the resources to \nrescind the ban on Priority 8 veterans from coming to VA for care. So \nfar, 192,260 veterans have been turned away across the country, \nincluding 502 in my home State of Hawaii. We are even starting to see \nother groups of veterans being denied access to care. This sends the \nwrong message to our troops overseas.\n  When you add up payroll and inflation, new workload, and new \ninitiatives, and factor in funding to support rescinding the ban on \nPriority 8 veterans, it is my view that VA needs at least a $2.8 \nbillion increase in funding for fiscal year 2006. The budget resolution \nfalls short.\n  Every time we work on a budget resolution I have to ask why education \ncontinues to be behind the curve. We tried to fix the anticipated cuts \nin education funding when the resolution was considered by this body in \nMarch, and although we were rebuffed on most amendments offered by my \nside of the aisle, I was heartened to see several of my colleagues \nacross the aisle vote with us on the Kennedy higher education and \nworkforce amendment.\n  Unfortunately, although the Senate spoke, conferees did not agree. \nRather than sticking with the Senate position on important programs \nsuch as career and technical education, GEAR UP, TRIO, and workforce \ninvestment, the conference report before us continues to underfund or \noutright eliminate funding that these programs require to be \nsuccessful. In addition, the conference report does nothing to cover \nthe funding shortfall for No Child Left Behind compliance or to restore \nfunding to 48 education programs recommended for termination in the \nPresident's budget. The list of programs includes the Excellence in \nEconomic Education Act, which I authored to combat economic and \nfinancial literacy in grades K through 12.\n  With regard to cuts in the area of first responders and law \nenforcement, the conference report slashes certain major programs, \nincluding the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services. The \npackage cuts over $1 billion in aid to state and local law enforcement \nand completely eliminates the COPS hiring program--both universal and \nschool resource officers--in what is the fourth year in a row where \nsuch cuts are being made. During consideration of the budget in the \nSenate, an amendment attempted to restore funding to this vital \nprogram. Unfortunately, this, too, was not adopted.\n  In addition, the budget would deny resources to many of our first \nresponders: firefighters, police, EMS workers and other first \nresponders. The budget creates a shortfall of more than $1.6 billion \nwith cuts to first responder programs, including the State Homeland \nSecurity grant program, Urban Area Security Initiative, firefighter \nassistance grants, the COPS program as I mentioned before, and Byrne \nJustice Assistance grants. An amendment to restore funding to our first \nresponders was considered when the Senate took up the budget in March; \nhowever, we were again unsuccessful in restoring funding to these \nprograms.\n  It is clear to me that this budget conference report fails families \nand communities across this country, including in my State of Hawaii. \nFor these many reasons, I am unable to support the conference report. I \nurge my colleagues to oppose the conference report.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, our annual budget should be a \nblueprint of our Nation's priorities. It should be a statement of our \ncollective values and contain positive initiatives for growing our \neconomy and preparing a better future for our children. Unfortunately, \nthis budget does not achieve any of these objectives. This budget makes \nthe Federal deficit worse than if we had done nothing, which means we \nwill pass on an even greater burden of debt to our children and \ngrandchildren. This blueprint also reflects a misguided set of \npriorities that sends a clear message to the least among us--our poor \nchildren, our disabled, and our elderly--that they are not as important \nas our wealthy.\n  It is unacceptable--and truly stunning--that Congress is being \nconfronted with a budget resolution that contains $10 billion in cuts \nto Medicaid, a health care program for our most vulnerable citizens, \nwhile simultaneously offering an additional $106 billion in tax breaks, \nmuch of which is designated for our Nation's wealthiest citizens. Where \nis the justice in these numbers?\n  Last month, a bipartisan majority in the Senate rejected any cuts to \nMedicaid. Members on both sides of the aisle said no. But the \nRepublican leadership ignored the result. On Tuesday, an overwhelmingly \nbipartisan majority in the House voted 348 to 72 to strike the Medicaid \ncuts from the budget. Again, the Republican leadership ignored the \nresult, ignored what a majority of Members said. Now we are being asked \nonce again to vote for these arbitrary cuts, even though we have \nalready made our wishes and those of our constituencies known.\n  Because of the budget resolution before us, West Virginia could lose \nmore than $84 million in Federal Medicaid funds over the next 5 years. \nThis would put over 350,000 West Virginians who depend on Medicaid at \nsignificant risk for benefit reductions, increased cost-sharing, or the \nloss of health care coverage altogether.\n  These cuts are on top of the numerous unfunded mandates that the \nFederal Government has passed down in recent years. Twenty-nine States, \nincluding West Virginia, are facing a drop in their Federal medical \nassistance percentage, FMAP, next year because of a change in the \nstatutory formula used to compute FMAP. This budget means that West \nVirginia will see a loss of approximately $17 million next year on top \nof the $36 million in Federal funds the State is already slated to lose \nunder current law. I have said it before, and I will say it again--the \nhospitals, doctors, nursing homes and clinics in my State simply cannot \nafford to absorb cuts of this magnitude.\n  How can we suggest cutting $10 billion from such basic support for \nvulnerable individuals in the same legislation that is seeking over \n$100 billion in tax cuts?\n  This budget reflects the wrong priorities, the wrong principles, and \nthe wrong decisions. These are priorities that I cannot--and refuse \nto--vote for.\n  Our most vulnerable citizens should not be a target for budget cuts, \nespecially when we are offering $106 billion in tax breaks in the very \nsame budget, a significant portion of which are directed to wealthy \nindividuals who have\n\n[[Page S4502]]\n\nbeen treated to large tax cuts since 2001.\n  This resolution is wrong for West Virginia and it is wrong for our \ncountry. I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the 2006 budget \nresolution conference agreement. I would like to begin my statement by \ncomplimenting my colleague from New Hampshire, Chairman Gregg, for his \nhard work and bringing this conference agreement to the floor. We need \nthis budget resolution to maintain fiscal discipline and control \nspending. It establishes spending guidelines, and procedural hurdles \nfor the floor when we fail to live by these guidelines. I commend \nChairman Gregg today on his first resolution as chairman.\n  The budget process forces Congress to contemplate legislative and \nspending priorities each year. Fiscal year 2006 is especially \nchallenging because I think most of us agree that deficit reduction \nmust be a top priority. Under this resolution, we will consider a \nreconciliation bill later this year that will cut mandatory spending by \n$34.7 billion over 5 years. This will mark the 20th time that \nreconciliation has been used since 1980.\n  I have a long track record in support of deficit reduction, and I am \ncommitted to helping President Bush and Chairman Gregg achieve this \ngoal. And $13.6 billion of the reconciled savings will come from \nprograms that I oversee in my role as chairman of the HELP Committee. \nWhen we passed the budget out of the Senate, it contained $8.5 billion \nin reconciled savings. The HELP Committee's instruction increased 60 \npercent in the conference process. Let me point out that the HELP \nCommittee will be responsible for producing nearly 40 percent of the \ntotal cuts of mandatory spending.\n  For the past month, I have been working with the administration and \nthe Budget Committee to identify a savings number that the HELP \nCommittee could realistically produce, without compromising the \neffectiveness of the programs under the committee's jurisdiction. \nThough the conference report exceeds my initial agreement of $8.5 \nbillion in savings with Chairman Gregg, I understand that Congress is a \nbicameral institution--and that compromise is required to reach a final \nagreement. This conference agreement assumes reconciled savings of $7 \nbillion on higher education reforms, and $6.6 billion in savings from \nPension Benefit Guaranty Corporation premium increases.\n  I want to assure my colleagues that I will do my best to produce a \nreconciliation bill that delivers on this very heavy lift--and I want \nto reiterate, this budget imposes a very heavy lift on the HELP \nCommittee. As chairman of the HELP Committee, I am committed to \nreviewing and strengthening programs under HELP's jurisdiction to \nensure they are cost effective, not duplicative, and that \naccountability is enforced in order to find responsible savings to \nreduce our deficit.\n  That being said, I will not report any legislation from the committee \nthat is either detrimental to the government programs, or their \nconstituencies under my jurisdiction or that I feel compromises the \nfinancial health of private industry--even if that means falling short \nof reaching the $13.6 billion reconciliation instruction. I will move \nthe committee toward the end zone, but my first duty as chairman is to \n``do no harm,'' even if that means possibly falling a few yards short \non deficit reduction targets.\n  The two issues that the reconciliation process will require the \ncommittee to immediately address are higher education reauthorization \nand pension reform. During the reauthorization of the Higher Education \nAct, the HELP Committee will need to find $7 billion in savings to \nreduce the deficit. My staff has already begun working with the \nCongressional Budget Office to identify policy options to reach this \ngoal.\n  We are working to identify additional savings by reforming student \nloan programs, so that these funds could be used to provide more \nassistance to enhance low and middle income learners' access to higher \neducation. This is the cornerstone of my ``lifelong learning'' vision \nfor the higher education reauthorization bill. The availability of \nquality education is critical for America's long-term competitiveness \nin the global economy. Congress has an important opportunity to \nmeet these challenges head on with the reauthorization of the Higher \nEducation Act.\n\n  The conference agreement also proposes $6.6 billion in reconciled \nsavings associated with changes to the Pension Benefit Guaranty \nCorporation. I want to inform my colleagues that this is a 230 percent \nincrease from the $2 billion in reconciled savings agreed to under the \nSenate-passed Resolution. Right now the PBGC has a deficit of $23 \nbillion, and I agree with the administration and Chairman Gregg that \nreforms are needed to shore up its solvency. Pension reform falls under \nthe jurisdiction of both the HELP and Finance Committees--and Chairman \nGrassley and I are committed to restoring the financial stability of \nthe defined benefit pension system. The solvency of the PBGC is a \ncritical component of these reforms.\n  I am pleased that conferees agreed to $70 bil1ion in reconciled tax \ncuts, and that tax relief remains a priority for congressional \nRepublicans and the administration. I understand that some members \nwanted a larger tax cut, but this figure will allow Congress to keep in \nplace tax relief that has produced almost 2 years of consecutive job \ngains. We need to keep the trend going.\n  The conference agreement will allow the Finance Committee to extend \nkey provisions like the reduction in tax rates on capital gains and \ndividends, the increase in expensing for small business under Section \n179 and the ability of individuals in states without income taxes to \ndeduct their local and State sales tax from their Federal income tax \nliability.\n  The resolution also demonstrates a commitment to energy development \nin Wyoming and in the entire United States. It is the first step \ntowards developing a comprehensive energy policy in the 109th Congress. \nThe energy reserve fund and the reconciliation instructions for an \nenergy tax incentives package will lay the footwork for a policy that \nwill help our Nation meet its energy needs in a fiscally responsible \nmanner. Specifically, I would like to reinforce my support for \nrecognizing the importance of developing clean coal technologies, \nsomething that is vital for the economy of Wyoming. I look forward to \nworking so that these technologies receive the funding necessary to \nbecome viable.\n  Also important to the coal miners in my State is an instruction to \nthe Judiciary Committee to reconcile mandatory savings that could \npresumably be used to increase certain fees on consumers of explosives. \nCoal companies and other mining entities are large purchasers of these \ncommercial explosives, and I urge the Judiciary Committee to avoid \nincreasing fees on them, as it would hit my State disproportionately \nhard at a time when no one wants to see higher energy costs.\n  I again thank and congratulate Chairman Gregg and his staff for their \nleadership on this resolution.\n  I also thank Majority Leader Frist and his staff for their help in \nmoving this important conference agreement across the finish line.\n  Finally, I commend my fine staff who worked tirelessly on the \nresolution--Amy Angelier, Kara Calvert, Diann Howland, David Thompson, \nBeth Buehlmann, and my HELP Committee Staff Director, Katherine \nMcGuire.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the budget \nresolution. I think that the budget process is one of those issues that \ndoesn't translate too well outside of Washington. Most Americans know \nit involves a lot of fighting over a lot of numbers, but other than \nthat what goes on here is largely obscured from public view.\n  Sometimes I think that is why Washington gets away with passing a \nbudget like this one.\n  See, a budget is fundamentally about choices--not just choosing where \nto allocate funding--but where to place our most important values and \npriorities. And there are no free lunches here either.\n  We must choose--do we want to run up our debt with tax cuts and give \nthe bill to our children, or do we want to get our fiscal house back in \norder? Do we want to hand more corporate tax breaks to companies with \nrecord profits while handing our veterans higher health care bills, or \ndo we want to keep our promise to those willing to sacrifice in defense \nof our freedom?\n\n[[Page S4503]]\n\n  These are the very real choices a budget asks us to make. And they \nhave equally real consequences on people's lives.\n  When we cut $10 billion from Medicaid, what does that say to the 53 \nmillion Americans--25 million of whom are children--who rely on this \nprogram as their only source of health care? The thousands of seniors \nand kids in Illinois who will be turned away from a doctor's office \nwhen they get sick because we chose to end their coverage, what does \nthat say to those Americans?\n  When we cut out a proposal to increase Pell grants that will send \nmore kids to college, what does that say to the 220,000 who didn't \nattend last year for the simple reason that they couldn't afford it? \nWhat does it say to our kids who will have to compete with kids in \nIndia and China for jobs when we cut out proposals to provide new math \nand science teachers?\n  When we cut $351 million in funding for veterans' nursing homes and \neliminate $100 million in State grants for VA facilities, what does \nthat say to the veterans who have sacrificed for this Nation but who \ncannot seem to get this Nation to sacrifice anything for them? What \ndoes it say to these veterans when we provide only around 100 new \nemployees to deal with a backlog of 480,000 compensation and pension \nclaims that haven't even been looked at yet? And what does it say to \nthe men and women who are willing to fight and die for this country \nwhen we are not doing much about the nearly 300,000 veterans who go to \nsleep without a roof over their heads every single night? What does \nthat say to them? What do we say to them?\n  Maybe we tell them that the budget process is complicated; that we \nare in some tough times and have tough decisions to make; that we are \nnot happy about the choices, but we have a huge deficit and no money \nleft to spend.\n  Or maybe we tell them that we couldn't afford to do anything about \nthese important problems because we chose to give out over $100 billion \nin tax breaks. $100 billion on top of the trillions in tax cuts we have \nalready given out most of which have gone to those few who already have \nso much.\n  These tax cuts have driven us into the deepest debt in America's \nhistory and squandered our opportunity to deal with Social Security, \nMedicare, Medicaid, and the true costs of the war in Iraq. And yet when \nwe try to do something fiscally responsible like pass an amendment that \nforces Congress to pay as it goes, we get rejected by those who want to \nkeep borrowing and spending.\n  Right now, there are millions of middle-class families who are deeply \nin debt and struggling to pay the bills. This body couldn't wait to \npass a bankruptcy bill to make sure they paid every penny of that debt, \nand yet it has now maxed out the country's credit card many times over. \nWhat does this say to Americans about taking responsibility for \nthemselves?\n  A budget is about choices, and I believe the choices we have made \nhere are just plain wrong.\n  In this budget, we should be meeting our responsibilities to our \nfellow Americans while still paying down the debt so we can meet our \nresponsibilities to our children too. It doesn't have to be either-or--\nwe can do both as long as we get our priorities in order. Many of us--\nDemocrats and Republicans--have been trying to do this during the \nbudget process. Unfortunately, the final product does not reflect those \nefforts. In the future, I hope that both parties can find a way to come \ntogether and make sure that America's budget reflects Americans' \npriorities.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am truly frustrated in the failure of the \nbudget resolution conference agreement to include the sense-of-the-\nSenate provision--which I offered and the Senate accepted by voice \nvote--that is intended to head off the administration's plans to raid \nthe Crime Victims Fund of over $1.2 billion.\n  The Crime Victims Fund was created under the Victims of Crime Act of \n1984, VOCA, as a ``separate account,'' meaning that the revenues in the \nfund are intended to be used solely for financial support of victim \nservices. The fund does not depend at all on taxpayer revenues; it is \nderived from Federal criminal fines, forfeitures, and special \nassessments. Since its inception, amounts deposited into the fund in a \ngiven fiscal year have remained available to support victim services in \nsubsequent fiscal years.\n  Following a proposal in the President's budget, this budget \nresolution conference agreement would rescind all amounts remaining in \nthe fund at the end of fiscal year 2006--an estimated $1.267 billion. \nThat would leave the fund with a balance of zero going into fiscal year \n2007 to support vital victim services.\n  This is absolutely shameful and unacceptable. The budget is a \nstatement of our Nation's priorities and with this agreement we say to \ncrime victims, ``Sorry, but your suffering is no longer our concern.'' \nWe are telling crime victims--the victims of child sexual and physical \nabuse, domestic violence, sexual assault, robbery, assault, DUI/DWI \ncrashes, elder abuse, adults molested as children, and the survivors of \nhomicide victims--that their concerns and suffering do not rise to the \nlevel of being a national priority.\n  The provision that we included in the Senate-passed budget resolution \nexpressed the sense of the Senate that we reject the proposed \nrescission. It assumes that all amounts that have been and will be \ndeposited into the Crime Victims Fund, including all amounts to be \ndeposited in fiscal year 2006 and thereafter, will remain in the fund \nfor use as authorized by the Victims of Crime Act.\n  The Crime Victims Fund is the Nation's premier vehicle for the \nsupport of victims' services. Nearly 90 percent of the fund is used to \naward State crime victim compensation and victim assistance formula \ngrants. VOCA-funded victim assistance programs serve nearly 4 million \ncrime victims each year. VOCA-funded compensation programs have helped \nhundreds of thousands of victims of violent crime.\n  The fund also serves victims of Federal crimes. VOCA funding supports \nvictim assistance services provided by U.S. Attorneys Offices and the \nFBI, as well as the Federal victim notification system. It is used for \nchild abuse prevention and treatment grants, and it is also used to \nprovide emergency relief to victims of terrorism and mass violence.\n  Since fiscal year 2000, Congress has set a cap on annual fund \nobligations expressly for the purpose of ensuring ``that a stable level \nof funding will remain available for these programs in future years.'' \nThe ``rainy day'' fund created by this spending cap has been used to \nmake up the difference between annual deposits and distributions three \ntimes during the past 6 years.\n  When Congress began considering caps on fund obligations, I proposed \nand Congress enacted an amendment to the Victims of Crime Act to \nclarify our intent to stabilize and preserve the fund for the benefit \nof victims. The amendment, now codified at section 10601(c) of title \n42, requires that `` . . . all sums deposited in the fund in any fiscal \nyear that are not made available for obligation by Congress in the \nsubsequent fiscal year shall remain in the fund for obligation in \nfuture fiscal years, without fiscal year limitation.'' Thus, in both \nthe authorization and the appropriations processes, Congress has \nclearly and emphatically stated its intent to maintain a stable source \nof Federal support for essential victim services.\n  Over the past 4 years, the Bush administration and this Republican \nCongress have squandered record surpluses and racked up $7.6 trillion \nin Federal debt as a result of reckless spending and budget-busting tax \ncuts. Now the President and this budget resolution conference agreement \npropose to reduce the deficit by siphoning off resources that we set \naside to assist victims of crime.\n  The entire crime victims' community--including the National Center \nfor Victims of Crime, the National Network to End Domestic Violence, \nthe National Organization for Parents of Murdered Children, the \nNational Children's Alliance, and Mothers Against Drunk Driving--stands \nunited in opposition to the proposed rescission. These organizations \nrepresent the millions of Americans who become victims of crime every \nyear. They have argued that rescinding the fund at the end of fiscal \nyear 2006 would create a ``disastrous'' situation for victim service \nproviders and their clients.\n\n[[Page S4504]]\n\n  My friend and colleague, Senator Crapo, recently joined me to lead a \nbipartisan group of 29 senators on a letter to the Senate \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice and Science requesting \nthat they oppose proposals to rescind all amounts remaining in the fund \nat the end of fiscal year 2006. Each of those Senators recognized that \nwe bear a responsibility to victims of crime; that it is appropriate \nthat compensation come from convicted criminals and provided to the \nvictim; and that it is entirely inappropriate to expunge this money \nfrom the fund and transfer it into the pot of appropriated taxpayer \ndollars. In the House, a letter with the identical request has 91 \nbipartisan cosigners. Clearly broad Congressional support for the \npreservation of the fund exists.\n  In every State and every community across the country, the Crime \nVictims Fund plays an essential role in helping crime victims and their \nfamilies meet critical expenses, recover from the horrific crimes they \nendured, and move forward with their lives. It is an embarrassment that \nthis budget resolution agreement fails to preserve the fund--as we \npromised we would--for the benefit of victims.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). The Senator from Michigan is now \nrecognized for 15 minutes.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise this evening to strongly oppose \nthis budget resolution, and I do so regretfully as a Member of the \nBudget Committee. I appreciate the courtesies of our chairman. I also \nvery much appreciate the leadership of our ranking member, who has been \nso articulate and so committed throughout this process to a responsible \nbudget resolution.\n  The individual pages of this budget resolution contain a lot of \nnumbers and complicated legislative language, but, taken as a whole, \nthis budget resolution is our Nation's values document. It is about the \nvalues and priorities of the American people, our shared values and \npriorities.\n  This budget reflects the wrong values and the wrong priorities for \nour country. The guiding values in our country are responsibility, \nopportunity, community, and security.\n  This budget is not responsible. In fact, it is incredibly \nirresponsible. It contains the largest deficits in the history of our \ncountry. Think about that: the largest deficits in the history of our \ncountry. It will add $1.4 trillion to the national debt over the next 5 \nyears.\n  This budget will force our children and our grandchildren to pay for \nthe misplaced priorities of this President and this Congress. This is \nreckless, this is wrong, and it does not reflect real American values.\n  The idea of America is based on optimism, that tomorrow can be better \nthan today. We all want our children to have it better than we did. We \nall want to leave them with a good economy, not a stagnant one saddled \nwith a large national deficit. We want our children to have great jobs, \nnot a great big debt.\n  Unfortunately, since 2001, this administration and the Republican \nmajority have turned a surplus of $5.6 trillion, created under the \nClinton administration, into a deficit of $5.2 trillion. Back in 2001, \nI was very pleased to be part of a bipartisan group of Senators, \nincluding Senator Snowe and Senator Bayh, who urged our colleagues to \nput in place something that would prevent us from sliding into this \nmassive debt. We warned our colleagues and the administration about the \npossibility that our $5.6 trillion projected surplus may not hold up if \nwe enacted large tax breaks for our wealthiest Americans.\n  In order to prevent this from happening, Senator Snowe and Senator \nBayh and I offered an amendment that created a trigger to the 2001 \nbudget resolution that would have prevented overspending on either tax \ncuts or new spending. Despite support from Federal Reserve Chairman \nAlan Greenspan and a few of our Republican colleagues, our trigger was \nrejected by the majority.\n  I might add that, in coming before our Budget Committee, Chairman \nGreenspan once again talked about some kind of a mechanism that would \nget us back into balance, something like a trigger that should have \nbeen put in place at the time.\n  Unfortunately, as a result of the administration's reckless economic \npolicies, we now have the highest deficits in the history of the \ncountry. We are borrowing money at a record pace, much of it coming \nfrom countries such as China and Japan who now hold 50 percent or more \nof our foreign debt, which has implications economically for us in our \nability to bring trade actions and hold them responsible for following \nthe rules. That has implications in our national security policy.\n  The value of the dollar is weak overseas, and our economy is \nbasically stagnant after record job losses in the last 4 years. Our \nmanufacturing sector, quite literally, is in a depression in my home \nState of Michigan, despite hard-working businesses and individuals. \nThese large budget deficits and the stagnant economy are ruining \nopportunity in our country--opportunity, one of the basic values on \nwhich America was founded.\n  Older workers are losing their jobs and their health insurance. \nYounger workers have less hope for employment in most of our \ntraditional industries that pay well and provide health insurance and \nother benefits.\n  There is nothing worse than ruining the American dream for our \nchildren. We can do better than this. Unfortunately, this budget \nundermines our children's chances to succeed by taking away \nopportunity. This budget saddles them with a massive national debt and \na bad economy. It cuts the very programs that help them succeed, such \nas education and job training and, I might add, over the objections of \nthis Senate, where the majority of people voted against many of these \neducation cuts before the resolution passed the Senate.\n  This final document underfunds our public schools. It eliminates \ncritical student financial aid programs for college students. As most \npeople know, the cost of a college education is soaring. Now is not the \ntime to be cutting assistance. Now is the time to increase it.\n  This is about creating opportunity for our children to succeed in a \nnew global economy where skills are more important than ever. I \nremember Chairman Greenspan coming again before our committee, and in \nhis written statement he expressed great concern about the growing \nskills gap between those who now have skills and those who do not have \nthe skills they need to compete.\n\n  This document does not invest in our future. It takes away \nopportunity rather than investing in opportunity. When the cost of a \ncollege education becomes out of reach for our families, it will be \nharder and harder for our children to contribute to our economy and \nlive the American dream. That is what this is all about. It needs to be \nwhat it is all about, making sure we are making critical investments as \nan entity together, as a Congress, as a Federal Government, as we do in \nour own families making investments for the future, as a businessperson \nwould do making investments for the future.\n  This budget also helps break up our country's sense of community. It \ndoes so by undermining the commitments we have made to our veterans, \nour seniors, as well as our farmers.\n  When our service men and women risk their lives overseas, we make a \npromise to them. We make a promise to them that, God willing, they will \ncome back alive and we will provide them the quality health care they \nneed and deserve. In essence, we are saying, as a country: Thank you \nfor your service. We want to help you as you come back and resume a \ncivilian life.\n  Unfortunately, this budget makes cuts in veterans health care \nprograms. Unbelievably, at a time of war, when more and more people are \ncoming home and changing one cap for another, this conference report \ndoes not provide the full funding for veterans health care. Even though \nmore and more of our brave men and women are coming home with extensive \nmedical needs, even though many veterans have to wait up to 6 months to \nget into certain hospital services, this budget still cuts veterans \nhealth care. I believe this is morally wrong.\n  This budget also makes cuts in Medicaid health care. The Medicaid \nProgram not only provides health care for low-income working families, \nbut the majority of our Medicaid spending goes to pay for long-term \ncare for our seniors and people with disabilities. Again, we stood, a \nmajority of us here in the Senate, and said no to that proposal\n\n[[Page S4505]]\n\nwhen it was in the Senate budget resolution. Now it comes back to us in \nfinal form, and we see billions of dollars eliminated from critical \nhealth care services.\n  Many people who are in long-term care facilities are seniors who \nworked hard their entire lives. They paid their taxes. They provided \nfor their children. And now many of them are living out the twilight of \ntheir lives in nursing homes. They deserve to do this with dignity.\n  As my colleagues know, seniors are not eligible for long-term care \nunder the Medicaid health program until they have spent down almost all \nof their assets. That means many of these seniors have already spent \nall of their savings and all of their retirement. They have sold their \nhouse, and every month they turn over most of their Social Security \ncheck to the nursing home. They are basically broke. All they are \nasking is to live out their lives in dignity, with the health care they \nneed. We can do better than that.\n  We can do better than this resolution. These cuts in Medicaid health \ncare jeopardize their nursing home care, especially when States already \nare faced with major budget problems, making it tougher for them to \nprovide quality care for our seniors.\n  Right now in my State of Michigan, 26 percent of the budget is \nMedicaid health care, and now we are going to add more burden to the \nState and force more cuts in care. The cuts in Medicaid health care in \nthis budget are devastating.\n  This budget also cuts assistance to our struggling family farmers, \nmany of whom could be forced to give up their homes and their farms. \nCurrently they are struggling with unfair foreign competition and low \nprices. So these cuts will only make their already bad situation worse. \nThe American people know that farmers are the backbone of our rural \neconomy. They are small town community leaders. They work hard every \nday and are simply trying to survive in today's harsh economic climate. \nI know because I grew up in one of those small towns in Clare, and many \nof my family members have been in farming. Family farmers need our \nsupport to help deal with unexpected low prices and natural disasters. \nUnfortunately, this budget will make it harder for them to pass down \ntheir farms to their sons and daughters who could someday become our \nnext community leaders.\n  Breaking our promise to veterans, taking away health care for our \nlow-income seniors and families, and additional hardships on family \nfarmers who grow our Nation's food is not consistent with our real \nAmerican values.\n  This budget also makes cuts in assistance to our first responders. I \nhad an amendment, both in committee and on the floor, that would have \nstopped these cuts. Unfortunately, there was not the support to do it. \nBut our first responders work hard every day protecting our families. \nDespite the 2-year-old bipartisan Rudman report that identified our \nNation's substantial homeland security unmet needs, we continue to \nprovide $15 billion less than what is needed to adequately defend our \nNation with first responders. This is according to a bipartisan report. \nWe are not doing what we need to do to support our police officers and \nfirefighters and emergency responders to keep us safe. What sense does \nthat make? What is the response in this budget? Decreasing funding for \nfirst responders. Again, what sense does that make? This makes our \nNation less secure. This budget goes against our real American values--\nresponsibility, opportunity, community, security.\n  Some of my friends on the other side of the aisle will downplay the \nsize of the deficits and provide a myriad of statistics on why these \ndeficits don't matter. But we need to make sure the American people \nknow the reality of the deficits. The reality is that these deficits \nare massive. We are not going to balance the budget by cutting \nnondefense, nonhomeland domestic discretionary spending. In fact, only \nif we eliminated all of our domestic spending, every single penny, \neliminating everything from the National Institutes of Health in health \nresearch, the Justice Department, all of our transportation spending, \nveterans health care, education, the list goes on and on, only if we \neliminated every penny would we just barely be able to balance the \nbudget. We would have to eliminate all of it except defense in order to \nbalance the budget because the deficit is so huge.\n  Slashing critical investments in our future, in our American quality \nof life will not make a dent in the deficit, but at the same time it \nwill take away our opportunities for the future for our children. We \ncan do better than this budget resolution. Americans deserve better \nthan this budget resolution.\n  I believe our budget should reflect our values and our priorities as \na nation. When we do our household budget, we have to make tough \ndecisions and forgo some things to balance the books. We all have to go \nthrough that in our daily lives. We do this because we don't want our \nchildren to have to pay for our debts. Parents across the country work \nhard to build up a nest egg for their children so they can have an \nopportunity to get a good education, the skills they need, and a start \nin life as adults with a great chance to succeed. That is what we all \nwant for our children.\n  This budget does exactly the opposite of what we want for our \nchildren, for our parents, for our communities. It does nothing to \nclose egregious tax loopholes or ask our wealthiest Americans to pay \ntheir fair share of the costs of wars in Iraq or Afghanistan. At the \nsame time, it pushes all of our soaring debt onto the shoulders of our \nchildren and grandchildren. This doesn't represent who we are as \nAmericans. We believe we should help make a better country for our \nchildren and grandchildren. Because of the reckless budget priorities \nof the last 4 years, our children and grandchildren will inherit \nmassive debt, high interest rates, and a sluggish economy.\n  We can do better. We can move toward a balanced budget. We can make \ncritical investments in the future--in opportunity, education, \ninnovation, homeland security, health care. We balanced the budget in \nthe 1990s. We can do it again if we work together. American families \ndeserve better than this budget resolution. I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Who yields time? The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes from our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, tonight families in my home State of \nWashington and across the country are concerned. They are concerned \nabout the security of their jobs, their communities, access to \naffordable health care, and a quality education. Unfortunately, rather \nthan inspiring confidence, the budget we will vote on tonight leaves \ntoo many Americans questioning their future. On issue after issue, this \nbudget falls short of what our communities and our country need to move \nforward.\n  I have served on the Budget Committee for 12 years. I have served \nthrough recessions. I have served through economic expansion. I have \nserved during periods of record surpluses and record deficits. I know \nwhat responsible budgets look like because I have worked with chairmen \nof both parties to create them. Unfortunately, the budget that is \nbefore us tonight, the Republican budget, fails to create jobs, improve \nsecurity, and meet our country's needs.\n  I am particularly concerned that this budget agreement, of which I am \na conference member, was reached behind closed doors with just one \nparty in the room. The Republicans control Congress, but that does not \nmean that half the country has lost its voice or that the majority has \ncarte blanche to make decisions that affect our families and \ncommunities across the country.\n  This is becoming an all-too-common tactic of this majority party \ntoday. We have seen it with the power grab that seeks to undermine the \nConstitution and minority rights on our judicial nominations. While \nsimultaneously moving toward breaking Senate rules, the needs of the \nAmerican people are being ignored by shortchanging them with a pathetic \nbudget that fails to protect our Nation's priorities or to fulfill our \ncommitment to our children, to our seniors, to our veterans.\n  One powerful example of how this power grab will hurt the most \nvulnerable is the billions of dollars this budget cuts from Medicaid. \nAt a time when\n\n[[Page S4506]]\n\nmy State of Washington and other States are struggling to meet their \nhealth care costs, we should not be in this Chamber playing games with \na program that helps ensure coverage to our most vulnerable residents. \nThe guarantee of health insurance that Medicaid provides is a solemn \ncommitment.\n  In March, a bipartisan majority of the Senate voted to strike the \nPresident's dangerous cuts to Medicaid, and just yesterday the House of \nRepresentatives too said no to the cuts. But tonight, ignoring the \nwishes of the majority of Americans and ignoring the wishes of both \nHouses of Congress, here we are voting on a budget that includes those \nexact dangerous and shortsighted cuts. As more and more working \nfamilies struggle to pay for health care without the benefit of \ninsurance, Congress has a responsibility to protect safety nets like \nMedicaid, not tear them down.\n  Those cuts--and this budget--are both irresponsible and they are \nwrong.\n  This budget offers too little help for families in Washington State. \nMy State has struggled over the past few years to get back on its feet. \nBut this budget doesn't give Washington State families the support they \ndeserve as they work hard to turn our economy around and build for the \nfuture.\n  People in Washington State deserve a real Federal commitment as they \nwork to create jobs, provide health care, and improve security and \ntransportation. On the issues important to my State, this budget comes \nup short.\n  Not only is this budget bad for Washington State, it is also bad for \nour country's economic future. As Senator Conrad said so eloquently a \nshort time ago, it lines up massive deficits for years to come. I have \nto say it is astonishing to me that so many people in the majority \nspeak of the need for fiscal discipline. The rhetoric does not match \nthe reality of this budget.\n  We are currently fighting a war in Iraq and in Afghanistan, and we \nare paying for it entirely out of deficit spending. We are paying for \ntoday's war on the backs of our children and grandchildren, when we \nshould be doing it responsibly as part of this budget. That is only one \nof the many major spending initiatives this budget chooses to ignore in \nfavor of keeping the consequences on generations to come.\n  Tonight, the President was on television talking about our \ngrandchildren. The budget before us robs our grandchildren of an \neducation, of health care, an economic future, and hands them a \ntremendous debt that they will be responsible for paying. I think that \nis the most fiscally irresponsible action we can take.\n  Sadly, this budget also shortchanges our veterans. My home State of \nWashington is home to 700,000 veterans. They rely on the services that \nwere promised when they signed up. Washington State has also sent \nthousands of brave men and women to serve in Iraq and Afghanistan, and \nnow a large group is returning home, including 4,000 members of the \nNational Guard.\n  That is why I have tried twice in this budget process to increase \nfunding for veterans health care services. And twice the Republicans \nhave said no. I even tried adding funding for this in the supplemental \nbecause caring for our veterans is a cost of war. Again, the majority \nparty turned their backs on them.\n  I am extremely disappointed that Republicans in the Senate have \nchosen to turn their backs on the men and women who fought for us, our \nveterans. By denying the crisis at the VA, they are ignoring our \nresponsibilities to fully provide for the men and women who risk their \nlives for our freedom.\n  I have heard the Republicans say we can take care of the needs of our \nveterans through the appropriations process. I am going to tell you, in \nthe budget that is before us today, there will be not enough money to \ntake care of our veterans through the appropriations alone. They will \nbe competing with our military bases and other critical needs for \nprecious few funds.\n  Our veterans, our military, and our future recruits deserve better. \nWe send these brave men and women overseas to fight for us. They should \nnot have to fight for the health care they have earned when they return \nhome.\n  Next, let me turn to education. This budget fails to provide the \nfunding that was promised in the No Child Left Behind Act. This budget \ncomes up short of what our local schools need to fulfill a promise we \nmade to our children.\n  I am also very concerned that this budget drastically cuts student \nloan programs and programs which provide critical early intervention \nand preparation for students to help them graduate from high school and \nsucceed in college. There can be no better investment than those, and \nour young people are robbed of that in this budget.\n  Finally, I turn to transportation. When we invest in transportation \ninfrastructure, we create jobs and we create economic growth. In fact, \nit is estimated that for every $1 billion we spend on transportation \ninfrastructure, we create over 47,000 good-paying, family-wage jobs. We \nknow investing in our transportation priorities today will help us \nimprove our quality of life and provide for future economic growth.\n  If this Congress truly cared about investing in jobs, we would be \nhere tonight considering a budget that includes the funding necessary \nto invest in our roads, our highways, and our bridges across this \ncountry. Unfortunately, once again, this budget that we are looking at \ntonight does not provide for our national priorities or for future \neconomic growth.\n  At the start of the President's second term, this administration \npromised to restore bipartisanship and they promised to reach across \nparty lines to meet the challenges of governing. I have to tell you, as \na member of the joint House-Senate conference committee, I come here to \ntell my colleagues that we were not invited to the table. We were told \nour presence wasn't necessary.\n  This partisan, backroom dealing spells disaster for the entire budget \nprocess. Adoption of this budget resolution is only the first step in \nthe lengthy budget process. It is far too early for this process to \nbreak down. I am really disappointed in the decision to ignore many of \nthe bipartisan amendments that were adopted in the Senate and, as a \nmember of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I have to say I fear \nthat this kind of partisan tone will make past budget battles on the \nfloor seem mild.\n  We have heard a lot about fiscal responsibility throughout this \nbudget process. Unfortunately, those lessons are ignored in this budget \nresolution before us tonight. We are ignoring our priorities and our \nresponsibilities, and we are increasing our deficits.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to reject this budget agreement \nand sit here tonight and agree to work on a budget agreement that does \ninvest in our future and pays off our debts from the past.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington, Mrs. \nMurray. She is one of the most valuable members of the Senate Budget \nCommittee. She is thoughtful, she works extraordinarily hard, she is \nwell informed, and she makes a real contribution to the committee. I \nthank her publicly for what she has done. I have found her to be an \nexceptional colleague.\n  The Senator from Colorado is seeking time. How much time would the \nSenator need?\n  Mr. SALAZAR. About 10 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, thank you for the debate we are having on \nthe floor of the Senate this evening. I rise in opposition to the \nconference report on the budget resolution.\n  This budget keeps mountains of debt on our children and fails to fund \nthe priorities of our Nation from veterans to children, law \nenforcement, and rural America. It is a bad budget.\n  The first problem is that this budget heaps more debt on our children \nand grandchildren than ever before. Counting what the President wants \nto borrow to privatize Social Security, this budget will add an \nadditional $600 billion in debt each year for the next 5 years. That is \nirresponsible. That will amount to over $3 trillion in additional \ndebt--debt which is more and more funded by foreign central banks.\n  This mountain of red ink ought to alarm the Nation. It has alarmed \nFed Chairman Alan Greenspan, who has been warning us to do something \nabout\n\n[[Page S4507]]\n\nit, and other great Americans like Warren Buffet.\n  We also know that this budget turns our priorities upside down. We \nought to fulfill our commitment to the men and women who have laid \ntheir lives on the line for this country. Yet this budget shortchanges \nour veterans by at least $1.6 billion.\n  The paltry increase in the veterans health care budget in this \nconference report will not even cover the cost of inflation. The VA \nsays that increases in its payroll and prescription drug inflation \nalone will cost $1.4 billion. VA's costs are sure to rise higher than \nthat due to the increasing number of injured and disabled veterans \nreturning home from Iraq and Afghanistan and other increasing pressures \non the system.\n  At a time when we ought to be standing up for the men and women who \nwear the uniform for our country, we are retreating from this Nation's \nbasic commitment to our soldiers and to our veterans.\n  The budget does nothing to rescind the ban on new priority 8 veterans \nenrolling in the system. Since January 2003, when the VA announced \nsuspension of enrollment of new priority 8 veterans, more than 192,000 \nveterans across this country--that is 192,000 veterans across this \ncountry--and 2,000 veterans in my State of Colorado have sought \nassistance from the VA and they have been turned away. That is \nabsolutely unacceptable and un-American. We ought to remember the \nforgotten America.\n  We ought to remember rural America. The budget before us cuts $3 \nbillion from agriculture. That is not remembering the forgotten \nAmerica. A coalition of Republicans and Democrats added back funding \nfor payment in lieu of taxes programs here in the Senate just a few \nweeks ago. That was an important amendment to the budget reconciliation \nmeasure. Rural counties across the West rely on PILT funding from any \nnumber of local priorities, from schools to roads.\n  The budget this Senate is now considering tells mayors and county \ncommissioners across this country that we cannot afford to invest in \nthem and to invest in America's rural communities. For all of us who \nare from the West, who live in States that have so many acres that are \nowned by the Federal Government, this is something that should alarm \neach and every one of us from the West.\n  We ought to fund public security. Yet this budget accepts the \nPresident's priority for law enforcement and homeland security, and in \nso doing, the Nation and Colorado will suffer.\n  The COPS Program has helped put over 1,200 additional officers on the \nstreets in Colorado and, yes, we have done a good job in fighting \ncrime. Yet the COPS Program, as presented in this budget, will not \nallow the hiring of single additional school resource officer in our \nState or in the Nation.\n  By reducing the funding for the COPS Methamphetamine Enforcement and \nClean-up Program by 62 percent, this budget would cripple efforts by \nlaw enforcement agencies in Colorado to combat meth production and \ndistribution and to remove and dispose of hazardous materials at \nclandestine methamphetamine labs around our State and around our \ncountry.\n  This budget calls for $215 million, or a 30-percent cut, to the \nAssistance to Firefighters Grant Program. In 2004, the Assistance to \nFirefighters Grant Program provided 54 grants in my own State of \nColorado, totaling $4.6 million. That program assists rural, urban, and \nsuburban fire departments to increase their effectiveness in \nfirefighting operations, firefighter health and safety programs, new \nfire apparatus, emergency medical service programs, and fire prevention \nand safety programs in local departments.\n  Like the President's proposed budget, this budget calls for the \ncomplete elimination of funding for the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice \nAssistance Grant Program which last year consolidated the old Law \nEnforcement Block Grant Program and the Byrne Formula Program. Funding \nunder this program has been available for law enforcement programs, \nprosecution and court programs, prevention and education \nprograms, corrections and community corrections programs, drug \ntreatment programs, and finally, planning, evaluation, and technology \nimprovement programs. This funding has gone a long way toward \nstrengthening the criminal justice system at the State and local \nlevels, but it will be no more.\n\n  With regard to these important programs, the effects of this budget \non my State are clear. In fiscal year 2004, Colorado received $7.4 \nmillion in Byrne grant funding. This budget for fiscal year 2006 \neliminates that funding.\n  Colorado received over $1 million in funding under the Local Law \nEnforcement Block Grant Program in fiscal year 2004. Several cities \nreceived tens of thousands of dollars in needed assistance, including \ncities such as Denver, Colorado Springs, and Aurora, and 20 other \nlocalities in the Colorado Division of Criminal Justice received grants \nfrom this program. Colorado cities now will receive nothing under these \nprograms.\n  We ought not to forget 9/11 and the heroic efforts of the men and \nwomen in law enforcement and first responders who responded on that \nday. Standing with our President and standing with law enforcement \naround this Nation, we ought to be investing in those personnel who are \nat the front line of defense for our homeland security.\n  Finally, we ought to fund health care and education. This budget \ndirects the Senate and House to save $32 million from Medicaid and \nstudent loans. I am proud, in my family, each of my brothers and \nsisters are first-generation college graduates. That is part of the \nAmerican dream that was made a reality for me. That education has been \na success for my family, as it has been a success for generations \naround America. We got that education because our parents and our faith \ninstilled in us the value of books and ideas. We also got that \neducation because we were able to rely on Federal assistance to go to \ncollege.\n  The price of college increases each year at rates well above \ninflation. Even so, this budget cuts funding for higher education for \nthe first time in 20 years. I repeat, this budget cuts funding for \neducation for higher education for the first time in 20 years.\n  Budgets are difficult. Every family in this country knows that. Every \nfamily makes its choices on how to invest its resources. Growing up as \nI did, I understand we cannot have everything we want. In fact, there \nare too many families in this country that struggle simply for survival \nevery day.\n  Spending is not restrained in this document. In fact, it has \nincreased and with it so will the deficits. Most importantly, budgets \nare also a statement of what we believe and what we value.\n  Why is it that in each and every case in this budget the needy lose \nand the most powerful win?\n  Why is it that the neediest among us are not rewarded but punished?\n  Why is it that every tough decision is taken not in this document but \nforced onto our children and onto their children?\n  I can only think of one word to accurately describe the set of \npriorities outlined in this document. It is wrong, and I will vote \nagainst it.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority controls 2 hours 12 minutes, and \nthe majority controls 3 hours 18 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I will take just a few minutes. We have \nother speakers on the way. I ask the chairman, does he have somebody \nwho wishes to speak?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, responding to the Senator's inquiry, \nSenator Hutchison is here, and I think she will be ready to go in 5 to \n10 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I will take just a few minutes to go back \nto the central point because I want to make certain that none of our \ncolleagues have missed it tonight, and that is the budget on which we \nare about to vote dramatically increases the debt of the United States. \nWe have heard a lot of talk about concern for the deficit. We have \nheard a lot of talk about the deficit being cut in half over the next 5 \nyears. We have heard a lot of talk about the concern of the exploding \ndebt of the United States. It is very important for my colleagues to \nknow what they are about to vote on because those who vote in favor of \nthis budget\n\n[[Page S4508]]\n\nare voting to dramatically increase the debt of the United States just \nbefore the baby boomers begin to retire.\n  I do not think it can be fairly said that anybody who votes for this \nbudget is fiscally conservative or even fiscally responsible.\n  Here is why I say that: Right now, the debt of the United States \nsubject to limit is $8 trillion. Under this budget, each and every \nyear, the debt of the United States is going to increase by more than \n$600 billion, building a wall of debt that is going to hang like a \nnoose around the neck of every citizen of this country. The President \nis fond of saying it is the people's money, let us give it back to \nthem. Well, it is also the people's debt. When the President says give \nthe people's money back to them, the problem is there is no money to \ngive back. The money is all gone. Instead, what we have is a sea of red \nink.\n  Now, my colleagues do not have to take it from me. This is my chart. \nI stand by it. But this is not based on my projections or my numbers; \nthis is based on pages 4 and 5 out of this conference report. Here it \nis. This is the conference report, and if anybody wonders what the \neffect of this budget is, all they have to do is look on pages 4 and 5. \nIt is right there. What does it say? It says that every year the debt \nis going to go up by over $600 billion. It says this year $683 billion; \nnext year $639 billion; the next year $606 billion; the next year $610 \nbillion; the next year $605 billion. Where is the cutting of the \ndeficit in half? The debt is going up every year by over $600 billion, \nand my colleagues say they are cutting the deficit in half over 5 \nyears? Where is it?\n  These are not my numbers. These are their numbers. These are the \nnumbers provided in this conference report, and it shows exactly where \nwe are headed. If this is where my colleagues believe we ought to go, \nvote for this budget. If my colleagues believe we ought to add $3 \ntrillion to the national debt, vote for this budget. If my colleagues \nbelieve we ought to take every penny of Social Security surplus over \nthe next 5 years and use it to pay for other things, vote for this \nbudget. If my colleagues think these are the priorities of the American \npeople, vote for this budget.\n  The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Will the Senator from North Dakota yield for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. The Senator describes this mountain of debt that we are \npiling up in this Nation and the trillions of dollars never before done \nin the country in the way that is happening today and has been \nhappening over the last several years and will happen under this \nbudget. That mountain of red debt is debt that every citizen is going \nto be responsible for in just the way the Senator described and debt we \nare going to pass on to our children and a mortgage that we are going \nto create for our children.\n  When I hear people such as Warren Buffett talk about this mountain of \ndebt and what it means to this country, I am concerned about what it \nmeans with respect to the future strong economy of our country and what \nit means in terms of the ownership of this debt by foreign countries.\n  Would the Senator from North Dakota, who has studied these issues and \nis distinguished on the budget of this country, please let the American \npeople know what it is that this budget means for the future of America \nif we continue to pile up this debt at this unprecedented pace?\n  Mr. CONRAD. It is very clear what it means because, as I have \nindicated, according to their own budget documents, this budget, which \nthey have advertised as one that is fiscally responsible, increases the \ndebt each and every year by more than $600 billion. The thing that is \nquite stunning is here is what has happened to foreign holdings of U.S. \ndebt just since 2001. According to this chart, it has gone up 97 \npercent. The truth is this chart is a little bit behind the times. \nForeign holdings of our debt have gone up more than 100 percent in just \n4 years. The result is we owe Japan over $700 billion. We owe China \nalmost $200 billion. We owe the United Kingdom over $170 billion. We \neven owe the Caribbean banking centers over $100 billion. Who would \never have believed the powerful, mighty United States owes the \nCaribbean banking centers over $100 billion? Here we are borrowing \nmoney from the Caribbean banking centers. Why, we have even borrowed \nover $65 billion from South Korea. I have never heard of a country \nbuilding its strength by borrowing from abroad. I have never heard of a \ngreat power that made itself mightier by borrowing hundreds of billions \nof dollars from countries all over the world.\n  No, this is not a way to strength. This is a way to weakness. This is \na way to dependency on foreign central banks. What happens if all of a \nsudden they decide they are going to start diversifying out of dollar-\ndenominated securities? Well, we all know what could happen. If they \ndid not show up at the bond market options at the U.S. Treasury \nDepartment, if they decided not to show up next Tuesday, interest rates \nwould have to go up dramatically. What would that mean? That would mean \nhigher prices on every mortgage, every car loan, every student loan. \nEvery business in America that has to borrow for its financing would be \nadversely affected. Our competitive position would be hurt, and \nAmerican economic strength would be damaged. That is the risk that is \nbeing run by this reckless policy of deficits and debt.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Will my colleague from North Dakota yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Do I understand the ranking member of the Budget \nCommittee correctly to say that what this budget proposes to do is to \nmake room for a massive tax cut for those making over $1 million per \nyear--not just millionaires but people who make $1 million each and \nevery year--at a cost of $32 billion in the coming decade, and that we \nare going to have to borrow the money to provide for those tax cuts? In \norder to give multimillionaires a tax cut, we are going to borrow the \nmoney from Japan and China and then leave middle-class taxpayers to pay \nthe debt service for the rest of their lives, literally, to cover the \ncost of that borrowing? That is absolutely astonishing. Is that what \nthe Senator suggests this budget recommends that our Nation do?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Well, that is the plan. That is what this budget calls \nfor. In 2006, this budget accounts for tax cuts to those who earn on \naverage over $1 million a year, and the tax cuts in the year 2006 alone \nfor those earning over $1 million a year--the cost will be $32 billion \nfor that 1 year alone, and every penny of it borrowed. Where are we \nborrowing it from? Much of it is being borrowed from Japan, China, and \ncountries all over the world. Does anybody really think that is a good \nidea?\n  Mr. JOHNSON. If my friend will yield further, what is further \nastonishing about this is that budgets have to do with priorities, much \nas it does with a family budget. One has to decide can they go to \nDisney World if they cannot yet figure out how to pay for their \ngroceries or their car payment. That is what families do across North \nand South Dakota and across this country.\n  To put this in some perspective, this is a $32 billion tax cut next \nyear just for Americans who average $1 million in income. We are being \ntold that there is not enough money to provide full funding for \nveterans health care. They need about $3 billion to $3.5 billion more \nnext year, we are told by our veterans organizations, in order to honor \nthe service of people who have put their lives on the line and to whom \nwe owe our liberty and freedom, but we are told, no, we cannot afford \nthe $3 billion, $3.5 billion for them, but there is $32 billion for \nthese multimillionaires we are going to borrow.\n  We are being told in school districts all across my State of South \nDakota that No Child Left Behind is going to be underfunded by about \n$12 billion this year. My school districts are struggling. They are \nreleasing teachers and counselors. They do not know what they are going \nto do. Yet we do not have that $12 billion, but we have $32 billion for \nAmericans making over $1 million a year. It seems to me that these \npriorities are standing America's values on its head. This does not \nmake any sense to any South Dakotan, Republican or Democrat, in my \nState, that this would be our Nation's priorities. And then to borrow \nthe money, to boot? This is breathtaking.\n\n  I appreciate the Budget Committee ranking member's elucidation of \nthese\n\n[[Page S4509]]\n\nissues because the American public needs to understand what is going on \nin this Chamber this evening. I fear this budget is selling America \ndown the river in terms of our future priorities and our future \nfinancial obligations.\n  When it comes to massive foreign borrowing, does this not even \nimpinge on the very notion of American sovereignty? Are we going to be \nable to make trade, military, and diplomatic decisions in the future if \nwe are in hock up to our eyeballs to foreign nations, in order to pay \noff debt to multimillionaires? Does that not have profound long-term \nconsequences for America?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Let me say what is stunning to me.\n  Mr. GREGG. I was going to make a point that the Senator would be \nrecognized at 9:30.\n  Mr. CONRAD. We got into a dialog. We will end that and then we can \nget back to Senator Hutchison, who has been waiting patiently.\n  What is a little hard to understand about this budget, we are \nborrowing money at record amounts, much of it from abroad, in part, so \nwe can provide $32 billion next year in tax reductions for the \nwealthiest among us.\n  Not only are we doing that in this budget, this budget also \ncontemplates every dime of Social Security surplus--about $160 billion \na year and growing every year of the 5 years of this budget--that \nsurplus from Social Security is being taken and used to pay for other \nthings when the President is traveling all over the country saying \nSocial Security is short of money.\n  Somehow none of this quite adds up. Social Security is short of \nmoney, so this budget takes $160 billion a year of Social Security \nmoney and uses it to pay for other things? And we are borrowing $32 \nbillion a year to provide tax breaks for those earning over $1 million \na year? And much of it we are borrowing from abroad on top of the 100 \npercent increase we have already seen in the last 4 years in foreign \nholdings of United States debt? Something is way off track.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, this may take a further response--and I \nknow the Senator from Texas wants to go forward--to make clear what the \nbudget does with regard to tax policy. This budget does not do anything \noutside of a baseline for taxes other than make it possible to extend a \nseries of tax incentives to working Americans that are going to last. \nThese include the research and experimentation tax credit, the \ndeduction for teachers' classroom expenses, deduction for qualified \neducation expenses, deduction for State and local taxes, welfare-to-\nwork credit, work opportunity tax credit, and making sure the \nalternative minimum tax does not pick up a lot of working Americans \nwhich that tax was not supposed to cover.\n  The representation that this budget has language which initiates tax \ncuts for other people, whether wealthy or not, is simply wrong. The \nbaseline of the budget for the next 5 years assumes what present tax \npolicy is.\n  If the other side of the aisle desires to introduce a bill or \nproposal which raises taxes outside of the present baseline, if they \nwant to raise taxes on wealthy working Americans, if they want to raise \ntaxes on small business, which is what makes up most of the high tax \nbracket income in our country, they are perfectly within their right to \ndo so, but they should not represent that this budget does anything in \nthat area other than continue the current baseline.\n  What this budget does in the tax policy area is allow the tax writing \ncommittees to extend tax credits and tax deductions that go to working \nAmericans, such as classroom teachers, which are going to lapse and \nwhich I suspect a majority of this body would support. That is \nimportant.\n\n  On the issue of Social Security, there is no other place that Social \nSecurity surplus can be invested today than in the Federal Government \nactivity. The Senator from North Dakota knows that. The only thing \nSocial Security surpluses can be used for today is to buy bonds which \nthe U.S. Government issues, and they obviously financed.\n  So this representation that is being used to finance the operation of \nthe Government, in reciting that as some sort of terrible action, is a \nreflection of the way the law works. You can invest anywhere else. If \nyou want to invest in something else, as the President suggested, you \ncan put it into personal accounts and let the people invest in stocks \nor bonds through the Social Security Administration as proposed and \ngive people a real asset that they own outside of Government bonds. \nThat is what the President has suggested. That is what has been \nrejected by the other side.\n  They cannot have it both ways. They cannot on the one hand say the \nlaw as it works is inappropriate because it funds the Government, and \non the other hand say Americans should not be allowed to invest in some \nsort of activity through the Social Security Administration which would \ngive them private ownership. The policy is inconsistent.\n  I yield to the Senator from Texas such time as she may consume.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has yielded to \nthe Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator wants to respond to what I said, I take it?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes.\n  Mr. GREGG. Obviously, the Senator has been responding to what I have \nbeen saying now for 2 hours. I have worked in 30 seconds, and I think \nwe ought to give the Senator from Texas an opportunity.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to do that. The Senator from Texas has been \nvery patient. Let's allow her to proceed, I will take a few minutes, \nand we will go on with the other Members scheduled.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of \nthe committee, the Senator from New Hampshire, as well as the Senator \nfrom North Dakota. It has been a lively debate.\n  I rise to support this budget. The committee has done an outstanding \njob. I will talk about some parts of the budget and talk about what I \nhope we will see in appropriations, but in the main, this budget does \nexactly what the President asked us to do in that it achieves the goal \nof cutting deficits in half within 5 years from the level he projected \nin 2004.\n  I heard the distinguished Senator from South Dakota earlier lament \nthis was a budget that was going to somehow add to the debt service of \nmiddle-income Americans. It appears to me it does the opposite; that, \nin fact, it will cut the deficits in half.\n  We are cutting the deficits in this country, while at the same time \nproviding for the priorities in spending. We are providing, for the \nfirst time since I can remember, a contingency fund for the war on \nterrorism. The Senate voted in an overwhelming majority to include a \ncontingency fund for the war. In the past, we have had supplementals; \nand we have seen what happens on supplementals. They become Christmas \ntrees. We are trying to fund the war on Iraq and all of a sudden so \nmany other things turn up as emergencies. This is what busts the \nbudget.\n  The distinguished committee did, in fact, put aside a $50 billion \ncontingency fund to cover the costs of operations in Iraq. Maybe we \nwill not have to have a supplemental next year; or if we do, it will be \nlater in the year and will be fiscally responsible.\n  This is a budget that continues to reduce taxes. Every time in the \nhistory of our country when we have reduced taxes in a major way, where \nit could be felt, it has not added to the deficit; it has, in fact, \nadded revenue. We saw our economy start stabilizing when we passed the \n15-percent tax on capital gains and dividends, which was a cut in that \ntax. This budget provides for $105 billion over 5 years in reduced \ntaxes. It assures we have the stability in the Tax Code that lets \npeople know in 2007 we are not going to have an increase in the taxes \nthat have already been cut; that people can count on the 15-percent tax \non dividends and capital gains, at least for the next 5 years.\n  This would also accommodate the sales tax deduction on the Federal \nincome tax for those States that do not have a State income tax. There \nhas been an inequity in the Tax Code for years, where if you have an \nincome tax in your State, you can deduct that income tax from your \nFederal tax because you should not have to pay tax on taxes. But if you \nare a sales tax State, you do not have that same opportunity.\n\n[[Page S4510]]\n\n  This bill will allow--although this bill does not mandate anything \nbecause that is a Finance Committee responsibility--the sales tax \ndeduction to be continued.\n  The budget allows for continuation of the teacher classroom expenses \ndeduction. We know teachers--every one of us in this country knows \nteachers--who take money out of their own pockets to buy pencils or \ntablets or Crayons or whatever it is they need in the classroom, or \nwhich their pupils need and cannot afford, to make sure they have the \ntools for teaching. We allow them to deduct from their taxes the money \nthey put into the classroom. We will be able to extend that deduction \nin this budget. We will have the opportunity to give teachers who are \nnot paid enough a token of appreciation for the job they do.\n  And finally, it ensures the AMT will not hit the middle class in our \ncountry.\n  In the big picture, this budget is a very good resolution. Thank \nheavens, we are going to have a budget this year, which we did not have \nlast year, so we will be able to say: Here is what we are going to \nspend, and we will stick to that spending level.\n  I want to mention one area where the budget fell short from what the \nSenate wanted it to do, and that is in the area of the administration \nof justice function. This function is the area which funds the Border \nPatrol. The Senate passed $42 billion to cover the cost of more Border \nPatrol agents and other administration of justice functions. The \nconference report is $41 billion. It is $1 billion less.\n  Now, I want to lay down a marker here because it is essential that \nwhen this budget goes to the Appropriations Committee, the \nAppropriations Committee should set aside money for more Border Patrol \nagents than the 210 that were in the President's budget. This must be \ndone so we can beef up our borders against illegal intruders.\n  This is not a matter of illegal aliens coming here to work, although \nthat is a major issue in this country. It is a matter of national \nsecurity. We have seen some very brave people sitting on the border of \nArizona and Mexico in the last few weeks. I have to say, these people \nhave shown a commitment and a caring that should be acknowledged in the \nSenate, that they would care enough to realize that 10,000 people, it \nis estimated, are coming across the border illegally into our country \nevery day. We are short of Border Patrol agents, and they are going out \nthere and sitting a quarter of a mile apart to try to monitor and tell \nthe Border Patrol when they see illegal activity.\n  There has been no violence. But it has made a huge impact. It has \nmade an impact on the number of illegal crossings. And it has certainly \nmade an impact on this country to see that many people are volunteering \ntheir efforts to care about the integrity of the borders of our \ncountry.\n  But it is not those volunteers' responsibility. It is the \nresponsibility of the U.S. Government to patrol our borders and to \nassure that Americans are safe from illegal intruders. We are not doing \nthe job. We are not doing the job when the FBI Director tells a \ncongressional committee that people from countries with ties to al-\nQaida are crossing into the United States through the border with \nMexico. It is a security threat, and it is a homeland security threat.\n\n  Now, I do believe the supplemental appropriations that is working its \nway through Congress right now is going to have some help in the Border \nPatrol area. I know the chairman of the Homeland Security Subcommittee, \nthe Senator from New Hampshire, is very aware and has visited the \nborder himself to see what the problems are. So I do have confidence \nthat in the Appropriations Committee we will address this issue. And we \nmust. We must control our borders at a time when we know we are in a \nwar against terrorism.\n  Mr. President, 97 percent of the illegal intruders are coming in \nthrough the southwest border. But this is a national issue. These \npeople do not stop in Texas and Arizona and California and New Mexico. \nThey go all through our country. It is estimated by Time magazine that \nthere are 15 million illegal people in our country, and it has been \nestimated that it is really even more, probably 20 million.\n  Since 2001, 1,300 agents have been added to the force. But this is \nnot sufficient to patrol 6,900 miles of border between Canada and the \nUnited States and Mexico and the United States. The issue that has \nrecently started being observed is the aliens from countries other than \nMexico who are crossing the border through Mexico, and because of a \nlack of resources, we are forced to release them practically \nimmediately. This again, I hope, is going to be addressed in the \nsupplemental appropriations.\n  The Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection recently said:\n\n       We do not have enough agents; we don't have enough \n     technology to give us the security we need. We need more \n     agents and we need to do a smarter and better job.\n\n  Two groups of Arab males were discovered by patrol guards from \nWilcox, AZ. One field agent said:\n\n       These guys didn't speak Spanish, and they were speaking to \n     each other in Arabic. It's ridiculous that we don't take this \n     more seriously. We're told not to say a thing to the media.\n\n  We must take this issue seriously. The agent is correct.\n  I believe that we can address this issue in appropriations, and I \nbelieve that with $41 billion in this account, which is in this budget \ntoday, we will be able to allocate the resources to increase the number \nof Border Patrol agents and to increase the number of detention \nfacilities so we will not have to release the illegal intruders, the \n``other than Mexicans.'' We can do it if we prioritize it. The reason I \nam speaking tonight is to say we must prioritize it. We must take this \nseriously. It is an issue for our whole country, and it is an issue we \nmust take seriously. We have the funds to do it in this budget, but I \nwant to make sure it is a priority.\n  The Budget Committee has done a very credible job. This Budget \nCommittee has presented a budget that will cut the deficit, over 5 \nyears, in half at the same time that we are funding the war. And we \nhave a contingency so we will not have to do it through supplemental \nappropriations. I thank the committee for responding to the will of the \nSenate when we voted overwhelmingly that we did not want to fund the \nwar with supplementals. Fifty billion dollars is exactly the right \namount to have in a contingency. That is responsible budgeting.\n  I appreciate what the Budget Committee has done. They have addressed \nour priorities. They have cut back in nonpriority areas, and have cut \nback in discretionary spending. I hope that as we go into the \nappropriations process, we will remember the need for more Border \nPatrol agents and more detention facilities to address this critical \nissue for the security of our homeland. I believe we will.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, you just heard the Senator from Texas say \nthis budget is going to cut the deficit in half over the next 5 years. \nI wish that were true. But it is not. Here are the numbers. These are \nnot my numbers. These are the numbers that are in this document, pages \n4 and 5. This is what they say is going to happen if this budget is \npassed. It says the debt is going to go up $683 billion the first year, \n$639 billion the second, $606 billion the third, $610 billion the \nfourth, and $605 billion the fifth. Where is the deficit getting cut in \nhalf?\n  The amount that is being added to the debt every year is over $600 \nbillion each and every year. I don't see the difference between revenue \nand spending, that gap, being cut in half anywhere. No, this is not a \nbudget that is cutting any deficits. This is a budget that is \nincreasing deficits.\n  The Senator said if we cut taxes, we will get more revenue. I wish \nthat were true. That would be great. Why don't we cut taxes 50 percent \nand balance the budget, if that is the case?\n  Here are the facts. Here is what happened to spending and revenue \nsince 1980. The red line is the spending line. The green line is the \nrevenue line. This is spending as a share of gross domestic product in \nthe 1980s. It was up in the 22-23 percent range. Then, in the 1990s, we \nsaw the spending as a share of GDP come down. Revenue went up. Deficits \nwere eliminated.\n  Then we got a new President in 2001. Look what happened to the \nrevenue. Taxes were cut. Did revenue go up? No. Revenue didn't go up. \nRevenue went\n\n[[Page S4511]]\n\ndown. Revenue went down dramatically from the highest share of GDP \nbefore the tax cuts to the lowest share of GDP since 1959.\n  This notion that you cut taxes and the revenue goes up is a fanciful \nnotion. It is a wonderful idea. If that really worked, let's go out and \ncut taxes 50 percent and balance the budget.\n\n  That isn't the way it works. If you cut taxes, you get less revenue. \nThat is what has happened--not just a little less, but a lot less under \nthe President's proposals, which have opened up this chasm of deficits \nand debt.\n  Earlier, I was pointing out the cost of the existing tax cuts in \n2006, for those making over $1 million a year, is $32 billion. That is \na fact. The cost of the existing tax cuts in 2006 alone, for those \nearning over $1 million, is $32 billion. That is in this budget. I wish \nit wasn't in this budget, but it is. That is a matter of priorities. \nFrom where are we getting this money? We are borrowing it because we \nare in deficit. The President says it is the people's money. Indeed, it \nis. And it is the people's debt. And this budget is exploding the \npeople's debt.\n  On the question of Social Security, I have pointed out that over the \nnext 10 years, under the President's plan, $2.5 trillion of payroll \ntaxes used to fund Social Security are being diverted to pay for other \nthings. The Senator from New Hampshire says you have no choice. That is \nthe law. Yes, you have a choice. Absolutely, you have a choice. This \nbudget is a choice. Of course, the choice we could make is to balance \nthe rest of the budget and use this money for the purpose intended, \nwhich is either to pay down the debt or prepay the liability of the \ncountry. That is a choice we could make. That is a choice I have \noffered my colleagues repeatedly, to so-called lockbox Social Security \nfunds so they are only used for Social Security. But that is not what \nthis budget does. This budget takes trillions of dollars of payroll \ntaxes and uses it to pay for other things. That is going to come back \nand haunt us.\n  The President says Social Security is short $3.7 trillion. His budget \nover the next 10 years takes $2.5 trillion of Social Security money and \nuses it to pay for other things. Is that making the situation better or \nworse? It is pretty clear to me; it is making it worse.\n  Now this idea some of our friends on the other side have gotten into \ntheir heads--I don't know where they got it--that if you cut taxes, you \nwind up with more revenue. Let's go back. Let's reality test. In 2001, \nthe President said: Massive tax cuts. And he said: If you make these \nmassive tax cuts, it will spur the economy, and we will be able to fund \na massive defense buildup, and we will be able to protect Social \nSecurity and Medicare. And we will be able to have maximum paydown of \nthe debt.\n  None of those things happened. Go back to 2001. We were presented \nwith this span chart, possible outcomes of the deficit, this range of \noutcomes. And the midpoint was chosen as the most likely outcome.\n  My Republican colleagues said: Kent, don't you understand, when we \nhave these big tax cuts, we will get more revenue, and you will be \nabove the top end of this range of possible outcomes. You are way too \nconservative.\n  Look what happened. We had the tax cuts. The red line is what \nactually happened.\n  We are way below the range of possible outcomes. After we enacted the \ntax cuts, they were supposed to give us more revenue. It didn't work.\n  With that, I will yield 15 minutes to the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from North Dakota for \nhis leadership on this budget. When there was a break here and another \nSenator was speaking, I asked Senator Conrad an obvious question: Have \nyou ever seen a worse budget since you have been in Congress? His \nanswer was no. Well, I have not either. I cannot remember a budget this \nbad.\n  When you take a look at the budget deficits of President Bush, and \nnow his Republicans in Congress, it reminds me of a lot of baseball \nplayers who were on steroids and in denial. We are seeing these budget \ndeficits mushroom, and the so-called fiscally conservative Republicans \nare ignoring it. We need to send out an all points bulletin by the \nCapitol Police to find out if there is one fiscal conservative left on \nthe Republican side of the aisle because each year now under President \nBush we have been digging this deficit hole deeper and deeper.\n  Sadly, the party that used to stand up and say, we want to balance \nthe budget--in fact, amend the Constitution to do it--has now raced \naway from that value, that principle, and we find ourselves in a \nterrible predicament. We have a budget that does not accurately reflect \nthe cost of the war in Iraq. It does not reflect the President's \nproposal to privatize Social Security. It doesn't reflect making \npermanent all the tax cuts. It doesn't reflect the cost overruns for \nthe President's Medicare prescription drug program. It doesn't reflect \nthe true cost of plugging this tax loophole problem called the \nalternative minimum tax.\n  Do you know what BusinessWeek Magazine said? BusinessWeek is not a \nliberal publication. They said of President Bush's budget that it has \nbecome a comedy routine.\n  Listen to what they said:\n\n       It resembles Swiss cheese, and the holes are more \n     interesting than the substance.\n\n  They understand that this budget doesn't reflect the true spending of \nAmerica. We understand that if this budget is enacted--and I am sure my \nRepublican colleagues will march lockstep to the well to vote for it--\nwe are going to find ourselves in the deepest deficits in the history \nof the United States of America. The President and his party are making \nhistory with the deepest deficits in our history and the fact that they \nare calling for tax cuts in the midst of a war. Tax cuts in the middle \nof a war? No President has ever done that. This President does it and \ndoes not flinch.\n  We met in the Appropriations Committee this afternoon with an $81 \nbillion supplemental emergency appropriation because you cannot add it \nin the real budget. It is not a real budget item; it is an emergency \nbudget item, although we are going into our third year in Iraq. The \nemergency keeps coming every single year. They won't add it to the real \nbudget because it makes the deficit look a lot worse. That is the \nreality. Yet, at the same time, as the Senator from North Dakota \nexplains to us, we find ourselves in this deficit hole with the budget \nthat doesn't tell the truth about spending in America.\n  This President wants to stand up and give tax breaks to the \nwealthiest people in America. Just next year, as the Senator from North \nDakota pointed out, there are $32 billion in tax cuts for Americans \nmaking over a million dollars a year. Did you listen to the President \ntonight on television? He spoke to the American people. This is what he \nsaid: We need to index Social Security benefits in a way that will \nreduce Social Security payments for some and increase them for lower \nincome people. I am not going to object to increasing payments for \nlower income people. I think that is a fair, just, moral thing to do. \nBut when you take a close look at the President's proposal, it means if \nyou are making the average income--$60,000, let's say, and that is not \na lot of money, but an average income--when you retire, the President's \nSocial Security benefit change will take over 40 percent of your \nbenefits away. The President said these higher income people--making \n$60,000 a year under the President's definition--must be prepared to \nsacrifice.\n  The spirit of sacrifice. Where is that spirit of sacrifice when it \ncomes to millionaires next year, millionaires to whom the President's \ntax cuts will give $32 billion more to spend. If you are making \n$60,000, you need a spirit of sacrifice; if you make a million dollars, \nhave a tax cut. How about $32 billion worth of tax cuts.\n  Then look at what this budget cuts: $10 billion in Medicaid cuts that \nreduce final funding for health care. Today, the Governor of my State \nand the mayor of the largest city came to talk to us about Medicaid. \nThey talked to us about what that meant. Medicaid, where I live, is a \ncritical program. Medicaid for most States is essential. Two out of \nthree people in nursing homes in America today rely on Medicaid to pay \ntheir bills so they can live there from month to month. Medicaid \nprovides health care to children, pregnant women, seniors, and people \nwith disabilities. The budget resolution cuts $10 billion out of \nMedicaid. We passed an amendment on the floor to restore\n\n[[Page S4512]]\n\nthat money, and I am glad a few Republican Senators stepped up and said \nwe have to, you cannot cut this program. This is for the neediest \npeople in America and, on a bipartisan basis, we restored the money. \nSadly, it disappeared when it came to the conference. The conference \nbudget resolution has put $10 billion in cuts right back into the \nbudget. That is unfortunate.\n\n  Medicaid funding covers 130,000 new children in Illinois and 135,000 \nnew parents because we worked hard to make sure that more people had \nhealth insurance. This cut will endanger that kind of coverage. As I \nsaid, Medicaid, the largest insurer in Illinois, covers more than 2 \nmillion people. More than 40 percent of the births in my State are \ncovered by Medicaid, and it provides health insurance to almost 1 out \nof every 3 kids in my State. That is where the President goes to cut, \nso that he can fund tax cuts for people making over a million dollars.\n  Senator Obama and I have a town meeting every Thursday morning for \nvisitors from Illinois. The question came up this morning about this \nwhole tax cut proposal. I said that I am reminded that when I was with \nthe President last week in Springfield for the opening of the Abraham \nLincoln Presidential Center, we were driving out of town in our \nmotorcade and someone had made a homemade sign and put it up right near \nthe airport. The President could not miss it; nobody could miss it. The \nsign said this: ``Whose taxes would Jesus cut?'' Interesting, isn't it? \nIf we are going to have justice and compassion in America, how can we \ncut health insurance for children, health insurance for the elderly in \nnursing homes, and then turn around and give a tax cut to people making \nover a million dollars a year?\n  The President has cited in his budget his affection for community \nhealth centers. Yet grants for community health centers will be cut by \nthis budget. We are going to see nursing homes impacted. Providers to \nMedicaid patients, whether they are hospitals, pharmacists, or doctors, \nare going to see dramatic cuts in what they receive.\n  When you get down to the other aspects of this budget that are \ntroubling, I have mentioned to the Senator from North Dakota that we \nare eventually going to get it right between the eyes with this \nalternative minimum tax. This was enacted to make sure some of the \nwealthiest people in this country paid something in taxes, but it has \ngotten out of hand. It has reached the point where it is affecting more \nand more middle-income families. If we don't stop it, it is going to \ncreate a great economic hardship on these taxpayers. The AMT applied to \n3.3 million people in 2004. That number is going to jump to 35 million \nby 2010.\n  This budget refuses to acknowledge the obvious. If we are going to \nhave a fair Tax Code, we have to deal with it. Rather than cut taxes on \nthose making over $200,000 and those making over a million dollars a \nyear, this administration and the Republicans in Congress prefer to cut \nveterans health care, cut No Child Left Behind mandated programs, and \ncut the health care on which many families and people across America \nrely.\n  I believe we can do better. I believe we should be sensible, \nunderstanding that fighting a war, as we must--a war on terrorism and a \nwar in Iraq and Afghanistan--requires reality in budgeting; that if we \nare going to do this, the thought of tax cuts for the wealthiest people \nin America is off the table.\n  We may not balance the budget this year because a war is expensive \nand because the economy is weak and because our gasoline prices do hurt \neconomic growth. But we certainly can see ourselves moving forward if \nwe had a sensible budget resolution. Sadly, this budget resolution does \nnot meet that test.\n  It is unfortunate that what we are doing today means that more \ndeficits will be heaped on those of previous years. It is hard to \nimagine that only 5 or 6 years ago, under the previous President, we \nwere generating surpluses in our Treasury, Social Security was \nstronger, we had an economy moving forward, and sadly since then we \nhave gone into the doldrums. Things are getting progressively worse and \nmore expensive.\n  As the Senator from North Dakota has pointed out, the mortgage \nholders for America are Japan, China, and Korea, the OPEC nations, and \nCaribbean nations, as well as those in Taiwan, Korea, and places such \nas that. It means we are in debt to them more than our children are in \ndebt to them and that their grip on the American economy will be \ntighter in this budget resolution.\n  We are still going to have an all-points bulletin to find a fiscal \nconservative on the Republican side of the aisle who will vote against \nthis budget. I hope they come to their senses and understand we cannot \nbuild a strong nation by these misplaced priorities.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the fiscal \nyear 2006 budget, a budget which does not represent our Nation's \npriorities. In addition, this budget piles debt upon debt and then \npasses it on to our children and grandchildren who will have to pay for \nthis irresponsibility.\n  Perhaps more disturbing, this budget puts tax cuts for the wealthiest \nAmericans ahead of the interests of working families.\n  Some of my colleagues have consistently talked about the need to curb \nand cut social programs in healthcare, job training, and community \ndevelopment. However, I want to highlight what these cuts actually mean \nto people. We should not hide behind titles and statistics. We ought to \ntruly understand how this budget affects the lives of those who have \ntrusted Congress with their well-being.\n  First and most importantly, this budget resolution cuts Medicaid by \n$10 billion. Medicaid provides a critical safety net for 53 million \nAmericans including more than 6 million in California. It provides \nhealth and long-term care coverage for more individuals than any other \nprogram. For most individuals, it is the health insurer of last resort.\n  I find it ironic that next week is ``Cover the Uninsured Week,'' a \nweek devoted to calling attention to the 45 million uninsured \nAmericans, 20 percent of whom are children, and millions more who are \nunder-insured. Because of this budget resolution, the number of \nuninsured Americans will increase.\n  To give a sense of the magnitude of the Medicaid program, consider \nthat Medicaid now provides health care for 1 in every 5 children. It \npays for one-third of all births in this country, almost 40 percent of \nall long-term care expenses, a sixth of all drug costs, and half of the \nStates' mental health services. It also is the largest payer of \nservices for AIDS patients.\n  And who is at risk in California under this budget resolution?\n  Children, pregnant mothers, poor elderly, blind and disabled \ncommunities, military families, our parents and grandparents in nursing \nhomes, employees working in long-term care facilities, community \nhospitals, and community clinics and health centers.\n  And, that is not all. The community hospital structure in the State \nof California operates based on a delicate balance of funding streams. \n$10 billion in Medicaid cuts threatens that delicate balance and it \nwill have a ripple effect on many sectors, not just community \nhospitals.\n  Public hospitals in California rely on Medicaid as their primary \nsource of funding--sixty-five percent of their patients are either \ninsured through Medicaid or have no health insurance.\n  Medicaid allows patients to access the health care services they need \nto stay healthy by providing chronic care management, immunizations, \ncancer screenings, and outpatient care. These are necessary to keep \npeople from getting their health care in hospital emergency rooms where \ncosts are exponentially higher.\n  This is coming at a time when our health care system has already \nfaced major reductions. Seven emergency room departments in California \nhave closed over the past 18 months. Six of the seven were in Los \nAngeles County. This is in large part due to the low Medicaid \nreimbursement rates and the high number of uninsured and uncompensated \ncare costs.\n  Last February, the L.A. Times reported that UCLA Healthcare, the \nlargest medical complex in the University of California system, would \nsoon be eliminating about 400 full-time positions, and again, this is \ndue to low Medicaid reimbursement rates and an unexpected increase in \nthe number of\n\n[[Page S4513]]\n\nindigent patients seeking care at UCLA hospitals.\n  I fear this situation will only worsen under this budget resolution.\n  California already ranks dead last among States for Medicaid spending \nper recipient and I am told it would take more than $1 billion to lift \nCalifornia out of that position.\n  To make matters worse, California's Federal Medical Assistance \nPercentage, or FMAP, is at 50 percent. That is the lowest allowable \npercentage under Federal law.\n  This budget resolution does not only affect healthcare. In community \ndevelopment, which I personally understand from my experience as a \nmayor, this budget drastically cuts the Community Development Block \nGrant, CDBG, program. This program is vital for low-income families and \nindividuals in more than 1,100 entitlement communities, urban counties \nand States, and more than 3,000 rural communities.\n  In the last budget, my home state of California received over $526 \nmillion in CDBG funds, accounting for 12.8 percent of the total $4.1 \nbillion grant program.\n  Over the past 5 years, the diverse use of CDBG funds have allowed Los \nAngeles County to develop almost 9,000 affordable housing units, to \ncreate and preserve over 2,000 jobs, to remove over 32 million square \nfeet of graffiti, and to provide loans and technical assistance to over \n5,000 businesses among other programs.\n  This budget is risking over 90,000 jobs and reducing much-needed \ntraining for 80,000 people. Basically, it is cutting employment \nopportunities to motivated people who seek training and want to work. \nThese people are asking for our help and we are shutting the door to \ntheir future.\n  In terms of small businesses, this budget resolution cuts financial \nassistance to small businesses, the engine of our economic future, \nwhich comprises over 90 percent of all businesses in California.\n  In housing, only half of the 80,000 promised vouchers for low-income \nfamilies and individuals will be restored under the Section 8 voucher \nprogram. These housing vouchers are essential to providing \napproximately 2 million low-income families, senior citizens and people \nwith disabilities with a safe and affordable place to live.\n  In sum, this budget asks those communities who are in desperate need \nof medical services, housing, economic development, and job training, \nto fund tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, to pay for the war, and \nto take the brunt of our budget cuts. This budget resolution will \ndisproportionately affect children, poor working families, the elderly \nand many others in California. I must object to a budget that protects \n$70 billion in tax cuts and mandates more than $10 million in needed \nservices. I cannot in good conscience support a budget that continues \nto ask even more from those who are less able to give.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this resolution is the latest in a \nstring of budgets that continue to set records for fiscal recklessness.\n  The test of any budget is the bottom line, and any civics teacher \nlooking at the bottom line would have to give this budget an ``F.'' It \ncontinues to drive us deeper into the deficit ditch, with little hope \nthat we will ever climb out of it, and it is just as revealing for what \nit does not include as for what it does.\n  This budget fails to include a single penny for the President's most \nimportant domestic priority, his plan to privatize Social Security. \nWhile I strongly oppose such a plan, if the President and congressional \nleadership are serious about pushing their plan to privatize Social \nSecurity, the very least they can do is pay for it.\n  This budget fails to provide for long-term reform of the alternative \nminimum tax, something on which there is widespread, bipartisan \nagreement. But here again, instead of ensuring that this clear priority \ncan move ahead, this budget remains silent.\n  And perhaps most importantly, this budget fails to restore the common \nsense pay-go budget rule that helped restrain our collective fiscal \nappetites, and made us pay for what we wanted to do. That is such a \nsimple, straightforward proposition pay for what you want. It's what \nevery family has to do. It's how the Clinton-Gore administration and \nCongress finally balanced the Federal books during the 1990s.\n  We are already in a deep budget hole. The only way we are going to \nget out is to stop digging. But instead of getting back on track to \nreducing our deficits, and beginning to pay down our enormous \ngovernment debt, this budget has Congress digging the hole even deeper.\n  This budget is deeply flawed in many other ways, but let me discuss \njust one, the use of expedited budget procedures to impose a \ncontroversial and environmentally reckless proposal to drill for oil in \nthe Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. As I noted during the mark-up of \nthe budget resolution in committee, this is a fight that we should have \nin open debate, not through the abusive use of the reconciliation \nprocess that itself relies on the most dubious of budget assumptions.\n  As one of our colleagues put it, we should not abuse the budget and \nthe budget reconciliation process ``in order to be immune from \nunlimited debate.'' Allowing oil drilling in this wildlife refuge is an \nissue that is too important to the public to be passed like this. We \nshould debate it in the open during an energy debate, not further \ndegrade the already adulterated reconciliation process.\n  This budget aggravates our fiscal problems by adding to the already \nmountainous Federal debt. It fails to restore desperately needed budget \ndiscipline. It corrupts the reconciliation process, originally intended \nto facilitate deficit reduction, by using it to worsen the bottom line \nby expediting more unfunded tax cuts, and by using it to shield a \ncontroversial attack on an environmental treasure.\n  In short, this budget is a disaster. The Nation would be better off \nwithout any budget resolution than with this one.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, once again we are on the floor of the \nSenate facing the destructive proposal to drill for oil in the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge. Before the day is out, the Senate will be \nvoting on a budget resolution that, if adopted, will open the way for \nthis destructive action. I cannot support such a proposal, and, as a \nresult, I cannot support the budget resolution. This is what happens \nwhen we attempt to make policy decisions--in this case a disastrous \none--outside the normal process of deliberation and full, unlimited \ndebate.\n  I serve on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, which \nhas jurisdiction over wildlife refuges. Under the National Wildlife \nRefuge System Administration Act, the management of the National \nWildlife Refuge System, it is the Secretary of the Interior acting--\n``through the United States Fish and Wildlife Service''--who is to \nadminister refuge lands.\n  For nearly 30 years, the wisdom of that approach has been borne out \nin the form of a thriving network of refuges and wilderness areas. \nToday, however, the Senate, without full deliberation and unlimited \ndebate, is prepared to ignore the true purposes of a wildlife refuge, \nand run roughshod over them through a back-door budget-process \nmaneuver.\n  This is clearly the wrong way to make this decision and the wrong \ndecision to make.\n  Two months ago, more than 1,000 leading U.S. and Canadian scientists \ncalled on President Bush to protect the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge \nfrom oil drilling. In their letter to the President, dated February 14, \n2005, the scientists questioned assertions that oil could be safely \nextracted from the Refuge and urged President Bush to ``support \npermanent protection of the coastal plain's significant wildlife and \nwilderness values.''\n  The scientists said oil development could seriously harm caribou, \npolar bears, muskoxen and snow geese--among other wildlife. They warned \nit could disrupt the fragile ecosystem of the coastal plain, which they \nsaid could lead to even more widespread injury to wildlife and its \nhabitat.\n  The signers categorically rejected the notion that the impacts of \ndrilling could be confined to a limited footprint, as pro-drilling \nforces claim, noting that the effects of oil wells, pipelines, roads, \nairports, housing facilities, processing plants, gravel mines, air \npollution, industrial noise, seismic exploration and exploratory \ndrilling would radiate across the entire coastal plain of the Arctic \nRefuge. What they said adds up to the obvious--that, by definition, \nopening up the refuge for oil\n\n[[Page S4514]]\n\ndrilling will be the end of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge as true \nwilderness.\n  The scientists who signed the letter are experts in the fields of \necology, wildlife, and conservation biology, natural resources \nmanagement and cultural anthropology. They include Edward O. Wilson, \nwinner of the National Medal of Science and two Pulitzer Prizes for his \nlandmark books on social biology, and Anne Ehrlich, who is a well known \nbiologist from my home State.\n  Hundreds of scientists are telling us that throwing the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge open to oil companies will harm wildlife and \npermanently disrupt the wild nature of this unique place. It simply \ndoes not make sense to destroy the Arctic refuge for oil that will not \nlower prices and will not make a noticeable dent in our dependency on \nforeign energy.\n  In particular, according to even the most optimistic projections of \nthe Bush administration's own experts, Arctic refuge oil will only \nreduce our dependence on oil imports from 62 percent to 60 percent, 10 \nyears from now. Clearly, that falls short of the type of impact needed \nto influence the price of oil on the world market. The numbers I just \ncited were projected in 2003, before the current steep climb in oil \nprices. They are the latest we have, and I doubt that the point \nchanges--that the impact on our country's oil imports would be minimal \neven with the most optimistic view of Arctic oil. In fact, the recent \njump in oil prices makes an even more important point--that drilling \nthe Arctic refuge is a hunt for fool's gold; not only would it do \nlittle to change the flow of oil imports into our economy, but it would \ndangerously distract us from the real challenge our Nation--faces and \nthe real solution our Nation needs--turning away altogether from our \nrampant usage of oil.\n  These arguments are well known and well understood. That is why the \nmajority of the Nation opposes this drilling plan and why there are not \nthe votes to authorize drilling were we to follow our regular way of \ndoing our business.\n  But since there are not close to the votes in this Chamber needed to \nauthorize drilling where the debate belongs--in the Energy bill--we are \nbeing forced to debate it in the context of the budget.\n  Is there anyone in this Chamber who believes that the purpose of this \nprovision is to generate revenue for the budget? That in the context of \na $2.6 trillion dollar budget, we must force the opening of a wildlife \nrefuge to get an essential $2 billion of revenue? Of course not!\n  The real purpose of this provision is to frustrate the rules of the \nSenate--rules that not only protect the minority but also the very \nprocess of judicious deliberation--in order to jam through a provision \nthrough reconciliation that its proponents have been unable to pass for \nyears. The generation of revenue? Merely incidental to that purpose.\n  Mr. President, I therefore ask my colleagues to look not just at the \nsubstance of this issue--on which the merits are clear--but to the \npolicy principle at stake. If the procedural sleight of hand in this \nmeasure can stymie open and unlimited debate, where will we be drilling \nnext? What other areas can we open for drilling, and incidentally gain \nrevenue from, through the budget? The Great Lakes? The areas off of our \ncoasts?\n  And what other measures, all across the substantive spectrum, could \nnow be free from unlimited debate? Just ask yourself, how many \nprovisions out there have been debated that incidentally generate \nrevenue or incidentally reduce outlays? Are they all now to be free \nfrom unlimited debate?\n  As we all know, this institution's historic commitment to open and \nunlimited debate could soon be besieged on another front. Has the mere \nprospect of this already made us so cavalier about the Senate's long \nhallowed rule of law for itself?\n  Early last month, the senior Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd, \nspoke so eloquently about the need to protect open debate and about the \nextent to which the Senate honors this tradition. Of course, our \npractice of open debate goes back to the very way in which our Founders \nand Framers conceived of the Senate. I have heard the Senator from West \nVirginia say, and have been moved by it, that the rule of unlimited \ndebate is there to protect the Nation and its values from falling to \nthe passions of the moment that destroy something timeless. I cannot \nthink of a better example of that need than this, where we are \nthreatened with the loss of an irretrievable piece of our natural \nheritage.\n  As we consider how to vote on this resolution, I suggest to my \ncolleagues that this is not a time to ignore the basic conservative \nvalues of our country that teach us we ought not to look at every \navailable natural resource area in our country as a place to exploit. \nOur values are stronger than that and longer term than that. Nature, \nafter all, reminds us of our humanity, and provides us with \ntranscendent moments--for tranquility and for gratitude for God's \nCreation. And that is what conservation and the battle over this \nprovision are all about.\n  Today's vote asks us to decide whether we truly value, and will stand \nfirm to protect, this great country's natural legacy. One hundred years \nago, the great Republican President Teddy Roosevelt first showed us the \nway to do this, and acting in his spirit, President Eisenhower brought \nthat protection to the Arctic range. Do we join them in valuing this \nland and protecting it or are we going to break ranks with those two \ngreat presidents and desecrate it, diminish it, change it forever for a \nsmall amount of oil? Is that really what our energy policy should be \nabout? Does it really offer us any hope of more energy independence \nwhich we strive for? The answer of course is, no. It is not worth it.\n  The mark of greatness in a generation is not just the opportunities \nit builds for itself, but in the resources it creates and leaves for \nits children. Not least are wilderness resources.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote down this conference report.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I oppose this budget and will vote against \nit. All of my colleagues should. It sets the wrong priorities. It \nbreaks promises to the American people. And it is the height of fiscal \nirresponsibility.\n  Let me begin with the priorities. The priorities of the American \npeople are not the priorities of this budget.\n  It is quite clear what the priorities of this budget are: tax cuts \nfor the wealthy. In just one year, this budget provides a tax cut for \nmillionaires totaling $32 billion.\n  Meanwhile, education funding is cut almost $1 billion below the \nservices we are providing now. A total of 48 education programs are \neliminated. The promise that was made in the No Child Left Behind Act \nis broken by $12 billion. We should be increasing our commitment to our \nchildren, not cutting it.\n  Veterans programs--for those brave men and women who served our \ncountry and are currently serving our country in Iraq and Afghanistan--\nare cut $500 million. As more and more veterans return to this country, \nthe demands on the VA system will only grow. This budget ignores them.\n  This budget provides no funding for additional police officers on the \nstreet, and two major programs to help local law enforcement are \neliminated.\n  Medicaid--the health care program for the poor and disabled, a large \nportion of whom are children--is cut $10 billion.\n  Funding for the Centers for Disease Control--to prevent diseases and \nto fight outbreaks--is cut 9 percent.\n  The promise we made to our farmers in 2002 is broken with cuts of $3 \nbillion.\n  What is going on here? Our children, our veterans, the safety of our \nstreets, and the health of our people--all are taking a back seat to \ntax cuts for millionaires. This budget helps the wealthiest 1 percent \nof Americans at the expense of 99 percent of Americans.\n  You would think that with all of these cuts in spending for important \nprograms, at least the budget would be balanced--or at least would be \nmore fiscally responsible than it has been in the past 4 years.\n  You would be wrong. This budget increases our debt by $3.1 trillion \nover the next 5 years. In 2010, the Federal debt will be over $11 \ntrillion.\n  That figure is so high, it is nearly incomprehensible. So let me put \nit another way: $11 trillion is $1 million every day for 30,000 years.\n\n[[Page S4515]]\n\n  And 11 trillion in debt is not the whole story. This budget does not \ninclude the almost $400 billion in costs for the wars in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. This budget does not include over $700 billion in costs \nfor the President's plan to privatize Social Security. This budget does \nnot inc1ude over $700 billion to ensure that middle-class Americans are \nnot hit with the alternative minimum tax.\n  Why aren't these included? Because it would mean even more debt. Debt \nupon debt upon debt upon debt. And most of it owed to those from \nforeign countries. We are borrowing from the Japanese, the Chinese, the \nBritish, and others--and sticking the bill to our children and \ngrandchildren.\n  And speaking of the President's plan to privatize Social Security, I \nfind it ironic that the President again tonight tried to scare the \nAmerican people by saying that Social Security was going ``bankrupt,'' \nwhen at the same time, this budget steals $2.5 trillion over 10 years \nfrom the Social Security Trust Fund. Instead of tax cuts for \nmillionaires, we should be paying back the Trust Fund.\n  Finally, this budget sets the stage for opening up the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling. It has nothing to do with the \nbudget. It has nothing to do with increasing our energy independence. \nIt has everything to do with destroying one of America's most \nenvironmentally pristine areas.\n  This budget has the wrong priorities, bankrupts our country, and \ndestroys our environment. It should be soundly and overwhelmingly \nrejected.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the conference \nreport on the budget resolution. This budget moves the country in the \nwrong direction. This budget resolution would worsen our fiscal \nsituation.\n  This budget resolution would increase Federal budget deficits rather \nthan decrease them. On its face, this budget resolution would add $168 \nbillion to Federal deficits and almost $1.5 trillion to Federal debt \nheld by the public over the next 5 years. This includes $70 billion in \nreconciled tax cuts over 5 years that are completely unpaid for, and an \nadditional $36 billion of unreconciled tax cuts over 5 years that are \nnot paid for either. All of these additions to the deficit and debt \nheld by the public are disconcerting on their own.\n  But that is not the full story. This resolution leaves out enormous \nbudgetary costs in order to make the budget picture look rosier than it \nis. It provides no money to fix the alternative minimum tax. It assumes \nlevels of nondefense discretionary spending for the next 5 years that \nare unrealistically way too low. It also leaves out funding that will \nundoubtedly be needed for our efforts in Iraq, Afghanistan and the war \non terror. Furthermore, the budget resolution includes cuts in spending \nthat are targeted to the wrong policy areas: toward low-income \nfamilies, vital safety net programs, farmers, and ranchers. If the \nthree omitted items were presented honestly, and the wrongly targeted \nspending cuts were removed, the resolution would increase deficits and \ndebt held by the public by much larger amounts over the next 5 years \nthan it does on its face. And I would hasten to add that not a dime of \nthe nearly $750 billion for the President's Social Security \nprivatization proposal over the next 10 years is included in this \nbudget resolution. Not to mention the trillions of dollars this \nproposal would cost in later years.\n  I am particularly disappointed to see that the conference committee \nincludes a reconciliation instruction to the Finance Committee to cut \nspending in our jurisdiction. Senator Gregg's budget included $15 \nbillion in Medicaid cuts over 5 years. The successful amendment offered \nby Senators Smith and Bingaman reduced the Medicaid cut to zero. But \nnow, the cut is back up to $10 billion.\n  There is widespread agreement that Medicaid should not be subject to \narbitrary budget cuts. A majority of the Senate voted for the Smith-\nBingaman amendment. An overwhelming majority of the House, 348 Members, \nvoted Tuesday to adopt a motion instructing budget conferees not to cut \nMedicaid.\n  Four out of five Americans also believe that cutting Medicaid is a \nbad idea. The Governors are also united in their opposition to having a \nbudget number drive policy in Medicaid reform. And more than 135 \nadvocacy and provider groups have urged Congress to reject the cuts.\n  But despite the chorus of opposition to cuts in Medicaid, the budget \nresolution reinstates $10 billion.\n  Now, some say that the Medicaid number is less than $10 billion, \nbecause cuts can be made from other programs within the Finance \nCommittee's jurisdiction. I fail to see how $10 billion represents a \nvictory.\n  Cuts to important programs like TANF will affect vital work supports, \nlike child care, for low-income working families who are struggling to \nmake ends meet. And I understand that some on the House side are \nlooking to the EITC for additional cuts. Another important program, and \ncuts here would essentially mean tax increases for hard-working \nAmericans.\n  Some claim that the cuts to Medicaid are ``small'' and represent less \nthan 1 percent cut in spending growth over 5 years.\n  But $10 billion over 5 years probably means that, over 10 years, the \ncuts range from $25 to $35 billion. That is close to the $39 billion \nthat Congress allocated to coverage for millions of uninsured children \nduring the 10 year lifetime of the Child Health Insurance Program.\n  And it is impossible to ignore that this $10 billion in cuts \nrepresents nearly one-third of the total spending cuts in this budget, \nputting this burden on our nation's poorest and most vulnerable \nAmericans.\n  Let's not kid ourselves into thinking that the cuts are minimal or \nthat they won't have an effect.\n  These cuts would tear the fabric of our Nation's safety net at a time \nwhen Medicaid is needed more than ever. They would increase the number \nof uninsured Americans at a time when we should be working on ways to \ncover more people not making the problem worse.\n  When the budget was being debated back in March, I said that it made \nmore sense to establish a bipartisan Medicaid commission like the one \nrecommended in the Smith-Bingaman bill than to have the budget cuts \ndrive our policy discussion on Medicaid. The Smith-Bingaman amendment \nstruck the cuts and recommended a bipartisan commission to study the \nprogram and advise Congress on how we can improve and sustain Medicaid \nwell into the future. The majority of the Senate agreed with this \napproach and we struck the Medicaid cuts from the budget.\n  Now we are voting on a final budget that appears to promise both cuts \nand a Medicaid commission. While I do not believe this is the right \napproach, to the extent that we are considering a Medicaid commission, \nit must be credible to have any value in this debate.\n  To be credible, any commission should be independent, bipartisan, and \ncomprised of experts who truly understand Medicaid and its role in our \nhealth care system. The scope of the commission's work should be \nbroadly focused on maintaining Medicaid's viability over the long term \nand should not be limited just to considering cuts to the program. And \nthe commission must be given a reasonable time to consider these \nweighty matters and should not be rushed. The commission must be above \nthe fray of partisan politics, but it must be responsive to the voices \nof the many stakeholders affected by this critical program. A \ncommission that does not meet this standard will not have our Nation's \ntrust, and its findings will not carry weight in the halls of Congress.\n  I want to commend my colleague Senator Smith for his efforts to \nensure the Medicaid commission is fair. I agree with Senator Smith's \nview that having an independent research institution, such as the \nInstitute of Medicine, oversee the commission would be a good approach \nto ensure a fair and balanced outcome. But any commission must look at \nthe whole picture with Medicaid--a short-term focus on cuts is not the \nright approach.\n  Reforming Medicaid is an important debate to have. But the debate \nshould be driven by policy, not an arbitrary budget target. Medicaid \ndeserves its own policy debate, just as we did with Medicare.\n  These cuts are short-sighted.\n  I predict that Medicare, including changes to the new Medicare law, \nwill be on the table if this budget passes.\n\n[[Page S4516]]\n\n  We should not be penny wise and pound foolish when it comes to \nMedicaid--America's most vulnerable citizens deserve better from us.\n  And we should not be adding to our already large Federal deficits and \ndebt.\n  That is why I will oppose this budget resolution. And I urge my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this budget reflects the wrong priorities \nfor America. It is way out of touch with working families in Michigan \nand across the United States. It does not reflect their needs and \ngoals, such as improved education and increased access to health care, \nbut it burdens them with increasing debt. At the same time, this budget \ncontinues to cut taxes mainly for the wealthiest Americans at the \nexpense of our nation's fiscal health.\n  Fundamentally, this budget continues this administration's policies \nthat have led to the deepest deficit and debt in American history. For \nthat reason alone it should be defeated. This administration's policies \nhave taken us from record surpluses to record deficits. The deficit for \nthis year alone is $427 billion. This budget would increase the deficit \nnext year.\n  Continued deficits will mean rising long-term interest rates and \nslower economic growth. Continued deficits will make it more expensive \nto buy a house, pay for college, or pay off credit card debt. Alan \nGreenspan recently warned that, if left unchecked, deficits ``would \ncause the economy to stagnate or worse.'' Continued deficits will also \nmean the continued use of the Social Security trust fund to cover some \nof the funding shortfall.\n  The President's tax cuts are a major cause of the deficits, yet this \nresolution would add $70 billion more in tax breaks. Three-quarters of \nthose tax breaks are for the wealthiest 3 percent of Americans, who are \nearning more than $200,000 a year.\n  Not only is this budget fiscally reckless, it is dishonest. \nRepublicans claim the budget would cut the deficit in half over the \nnext 5 years, but they simply leave out several major expenses, \nincluding the essential cost of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan; the \ncost of the personnel added to the Army and Marines; and the cost of \nreforming the Alternative Minimum Tax which otherwise would increase \nthe burden on middle income families.\n  To conceal further the damage it does to the Nation's fiscal outlook, \nthis budget uses 5-year projections instead of the customary 10-year \nnumbers. Hidden just beyond the 5-year budget window is the exploding \ncost of the tax cuts and their growing effect on the deficit.\n  To return to the path of fiscal discipline, we need to reinstate \n``pay-as-you-go'' rules that would require both entitlement spending \nincreases and tax cuts to be fully paid for or face a 60-vote point of \norder in the Senate. The ``pay-as-you-go'' rules were successful in the \n1990s and would be successful again in restraining the deficit without \nunduly harming critical public services. The majority has opposed \nreinstating these rules because they don't want to be forced to pay for \nnew tax cuts.\n  The budget plan that is before the Congress is a huge missed \nopportunity. We could be debating a budget today that addresses our \nNation's most pressing problems, such as the loss of millions of \nmanufacturing jobs, inadequate education, and the 45 million Americans \nwithout health insurance.\n  Instead, this budget makes some problems worse. In the Senate-passed \nbudget resolution, we were able to defeat proposed cuts to Medicaid, \nand cuts to the health care program for millions of children, pregnant \nwomen, elderly and the disabled. However, this conference report still \nproposes $10 billion in Medicaid cuts over the next 5 years. It is \nunconscionable for this administration and this Congress to pay for tax \ncuts for the wealthiest Americans by cutting health care for the most \nvulnerable Americans.\n  This budget also weakens environmental protection by providing for \ndrilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. We have a \nresponsibility to promote a balanced energy plan that invests in \nAmerica's future and protects our environment, not one that damages our \nprotected lands.\n  In summary, this budget gives massive and fiscally irresponsible tax \ncuts mainly to the wealthiest Americans while failing to address our \nreal needs. Instead of investing in America, this budget indebts \nAmerica for years to come. These are the wrong priorities for America, \nand I cannot support this budget.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I am disappointed by the budget \nresolution before us here today.\n  I am disappointed, but I can't say I am surprised, given the track \nrecord of this President and the Republican leadership in Congress.\n  The process of developing a budget each year provides an opportunity \nto take stock of our priorities as a Nation.\n  The President outlines his priorities through his budget, but it is \nthe Congress, with its control of the purse strings, that is ultimately \ncharged with the responsibility of fashioning and enacting legislation.\n  Regrettably, the priorities reflected in this budget resolution--\nwhich mirror those in the administration's budget proposal--are wrong \nfor America and certainly wrong for the people of New Jersey.\n  In New Jersey, we are particularly sensitive to the choices made by \nthis administration and its allies in Congress, since we provide the \ngreatest contribution of taxes paid relative to what we get back from \nthe Federal Government. Our return on the Federal dollar has fallen \nfrom 70 cents to a meager 57 cents under the Bush administration. This \nbudget will only further increase the strain on New Jersey's citizens, \nespecially our most vulnerable: our children, our disabled, and our \nseniors.\n  Put plainly, this budget is not about lowering the deficit or making \nshared sacrifices or addressing the needs we have as a society. It's \nabout making room for more tax breaks for the most fortunate--and it's \nnot even successful at doing that.\n  How do we, as legislators, look hard-working Americans in the eye and \ntell them honestly that we can't afford $10 billion for Medicaid, but \nwe can afford $204 billion in tax breaks for the most well-off over the \nnext 5 years? That's how much the president's tax cuts, under this \nbudget, would provide for those with incomes greater than $1 million.\n  How do I tell parents in New Jersey that the President and the \nleaders of his party in Congress don't believe we can afford $4.8 \nbillion for education next year, but they do believe we can afford more \nthan 6 times that amount in tax breaks for those making more than $1 \nmillion?\n  What parent thinks education needs a cut? Or first responders? Or \ncommunity development? Or veterans?\n  How do I tell the 82,000 commuters who ride New Jersey Transit trains \nevery day or the commuters who ride SEPTA or the millions who rely on \nAmtrak that the Federal Government would rather pay for tax cuts for \nthe most fortunate than for the infrastructure that literally takes our \nNation to work in the morning and brings them home to their families at \nnight?\n  This choice simply does not reflect our Nation's fundamental values. \nI don't think it reflects the values of even those benefiting most from \nit. Nor does it address the real needs of working families in New \nJersey and across America.\n  That reality includes rising health care costs that are driving \nfamilies into bankruptcy as never before and preventing businesses from \ncreating jobs. It includes growing wage disparity and a labor market \nthat's stayed weaker for longer coming out of a recession than any \nother time on record.\n  According to the Tax Policy Center of the Urban Institute and the \nBrookings Institution, more than 70 percent of the benefits of the \nPresident's tax breaks enacted in 2001 and 2003 go to the 20 percent of \ntaxpayers with the highest incomes. More than 25 percent of the tax-cut \nbenefits go to the top 1 percent.\n  The tradeoff being proposed could not be clearer. The programs this \nbudget proposes to cut are merely a drop in the bucket compared to the \ncost of the tax cuts.\n  No amount of spin can obscure the numbers.\n  Let's remember the context. Since President Bush took office, the \nFederal budget deficit has deteriorated every\n\n[[Page S4517]]\n\nyear. This year, we are expected to be $427 billion in the hole.\n  In all, the Bush administration has reduced Federal revenues to their \nlowest level as a share of the economy since the 1950's. As a \nconsequence, we no longer have the resources to deal with the Nation's \npriorities.\n  In light of this record, President Bush and his Congressional allies' \nrecent claims of fiscal responsibility simply are not credible. This \nbudget makes those claims even less credible by achieving much of its \npurported ``cost savings'' by passing the buck to State and local \ngovernments.\n  Lowering the numbers here in Washington is not the same thing as \nfiscal discipline if this is simply an exercise in shifting cost \nburdens to States and communities. That is hardly a plus for the \nAmerican people--and certainly not for New Jersey.\n  Our States are already stretched too thin. In New Jersey, we have a \nbudget shortfall of $4 billion to $5 billion and annual property tax \nincreases of 7 percent. Much of the reality for States in budget and \ntax policy has been the result of cost burdens and unfunded mandates \npassed down from this administration and its allies in Congress.\n  We have heard claims from the other side that their tax cuts for the \nmost fortunate are somehow responsible for providing a boost to our \neconomy.\n  But as any serious-minded economist not on the Republican payroll \nwill tell you, the real story of our modest growth has been the longest \nsustained monetary expansion on record by the Federal Reserve.\n  Claims that the tax cuts are responsible for significant economic \ngrowth are reminiscent of a rooster taking credit for the sun coming \nup.\n  The more noticeable result of the tax cuts has been an explosion in \nour Nation's debt, starting with the $1.8 trillion cost over 10 years \nof making the cuts permanent. If we continue along the path set by this \nadministration, by 2015, each family's share of the national debt will \nbe $73,563. This is simply unacceptable.\n  I hope that we take a long, hard look at the priorities our Nation \nhas followed under this President because, in my view, those priorities \nneed major changes.\n  As I said earlier, I am disappointed that the majority party in \nCongress has chosen to embrace these priorities. That is why I cannot \nsupport their budget.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the federal budget should be a reflection \nof American values. It should be an honest document, it should be \nresponsible, and it should create opportunity. This budget fails that \ntest. It is dishonest because it ignores significant funding \nobligations. It is irresponsible because it greatly increases our \nnational debt and ignores pressing needs. And it fails to invest in our \nfuture and create opportunity for all Americans.\n  Using an accounting trick that would land a CPA in jail, this budget \nignores billions of dollars that the Nation must spend in the coming \nyears. It excludes the cost of ongoing military operations in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, which may amount to almost $400 billion over the next 10 \nyears. It excludes the cost of the President's Social Security \nprivatization plan, which would cost more than $750 billion over the \nnext 10 years. It excludes the $600 billion it will cost to repeal the \nalternative minimum tax over the next ten years. It even excludes the \ninterest on the debt. And yet, the Republican leadership continues to \nmislead the American people by telling them that this budget will cut \nthe deficit by half.\n  The budget significantly increases our national debt. If you include \nthe expenditures that the budget omits, the operating deficit in 2006 \nwill be $579 billion and rise to $595 billion in 2009. Thus, the budget \nwill add close to $600 billion a year to our national debt, debt that \nis increasingly financed by foreign countries and businesses. In fact, \nforeign holdings of our debt have increased 92 percent since this \nPresident came into office. By doing so, this President is ceding \nfinancial control to foreign interests, and that undermines America's \nfiscal and economic stability.\n  The budget calls for substantial new tax cuts while significantly \ncutting essential domestic programs. The reconciliation instructions \ncall for a $70 billion tax cut, which will likely lead to a 2-year \nextension of the capital gains and dividends tax cuts enacted in 2003 \nand slated to expire in 2008. In 2005, slightly more than half of these \ntax cuts will benefit household with incomes over $1 million, only 0.2 \npercent of all households.\n  These tax cuts come at the expense of working Americans. Over the \nnext 5 years, over $121 billion will be cut from education, veterans \nhealth care, environmental protection, housing, and other important \nprograms. This budget fails to fully fund No Child Left Behind. It \nfails to help our troops by insuring that all members of the National \nGuard and Reserves have health insurance. It fails to help military \nfamilies meet the inevitable expenses when a loved one is deployed. \nAnd, it sets in motion a backdoor legislative process to auction the \nArctic Refuge to oil companies, while failing to adequately fund \ninvestments in domestic, reliable and renewable energy.\n  This budget also hurts manufacturers and small businesses by \neliminating the bipartisan Snowe-Kerry amendment which restored $78 \nmillion to the Small Business Administration, an agency whose budget is \na mere 3/100ths of a percent of the total budget, yet which has been \ncut the most of any agency since this President took office.\n  This budget makes the wrong choices for Americans. It hides the real \ncosts of this administration's priorities. It significantly increases \nour national debt, debt held by foreign entities and passed on to our \nchildren. It provides tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans while \ncutting those programs most needed by working families. I do not agree \nwith these choices, and I do not support this budget.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nMinnesota, Mr. Dayton.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized for \n10 minutes.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, this budget proves the old saying that the \nend justifies the means. In this case the process used to produce this \nbudget was a disgrace, and the budget itself is a disgrace.\n  The Democratic Senators who were the official members of the \nconference committee were not even allowed to attend the meetings \nbehind closed doors. That is not only unfair, that is ridiculous. The \nother side has the votes on the conference committee to pass whatever \nthey want. That is fair. They are the majority caucus. To not even \nallow Democratic Senators in the room, what are they hiding? What are \nthey ashamed of?\n  They should be ashamed of this budget, and they should be ashamed of \nhiding their decisions behind closed doors. In my home State of \nMinnesota, we have an open meeting law. It applies to every public body \nfrom the State legislature to city councils to school boards. Any \nmeeting of three or more members must be a public meeting. There must \nbe a public notice given so that people can watch their elected \nofficials make the decisions that affect their lives and hold them \naccountable.\n  This budget fiasco underscores the need for such an open meeting law \nin Washington to open the doors of these conference committees to \nDemocrats, to the press, and to the people. But if the budget process \nwe have seen here is the reason we need an open meeting law in \nWashington, this budget product is the reason we will not get one.\n  If I were responsible for this disgrace, I would want to hide, too. \nBut I am not responsible for it. No Democratic Senator is responsible \nfor it. This budget manages to increase the Federal debt, as the \nSenator from North Dakota so articulately demonstrated, and I commend \nhim for his vigilance, for his integrity, and for his straightforward \nhonesty.\n  This budget increases the Federal debt. It preserves the tax favors \nfor the rich and the super rich, and it cuts services for \nschoolchildren, college students, senior citizens, veterans, and so \nmany others. To use the President's phrase, that is a trifecta. In this \ncase, it is a terrible trifecta.\n  This budget also uses a backdoor trick to open ANWR to oil and gas \ndrilling, and that makes it a grand scam.\n  It is a clear picture, this budget of Republican priorities. It \ncontradicts all the fake rhetoric and false promises such as No Child \nLeft Behind, Clear Skies, or Healthy Communities because this budget \nleaves millions of\n\n[[Page S4518]]\n\nschoolchildren behind and millions more college students in debt. I \nknow because I offered my sixth amendment to fully fund the Federal \ncommitment to special education, and it failed once again.\n  This budget leaves the Federal share of the cost for special \neducation still less than half of what was promised 28 years ago. It \nunderfunds veterans services, including health care services for our \nservice men and women who are returning from their heroic service in \nIraq and Afghanistan, many with serious wounds and injuries. And this \nis on top of Republicans' rejection of emergency funding for VA health \ncare and supplemental appropriations for our war efforts. Every \nDemocratic Senator voted for that emergency funding for VA health care, \nand every Republican Senator, except for Senator Specter from \nPennsylvania, voted against it.\n  This budget tonight means that all veterans, young and old, will have \nlonger waits for the health care they need, that they were promised, \nand that they certainly deserve.\n  This budget tells the truth about Republican priorities, not the \nsoothing rhetoric, not the misleading slogans, not even the face-saving \nvotes on the Senate budget to spare senior citizens in nursing homes \nfrom draconian cuts that the President proposed. Those cuts were put \nback in this budget once again behind closed doors. And it is certainly \nnot the tricks and gimmicks that were used to disguise how bad the \ndeficits in this budget really are.\n  This budget takes America in the wrong direction, toward a fiscal \nArmageddon that will occur much sooner than the much advertised and \noverdramatized Social Security shortfall that the President's proposal \nwould make much worse.\n  The continuing deficits in this budget are what the nonpartisan \nfiscal watchdog, the Concord Coalition, has called ``the most reckless \nfiscal policy in our Nation's history.''\n  The deficit reduction that is pretended to be in this budget is about \nas likely as finding weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.\n  As the Republican chairman of the Senate Finance Committee has \nobserved tonight, this budget ignores the rising injustice of the \nalternative minimum tax which will cause major tax increases for \nmillions of middle-class Americans in the years ahead unless we address \nit as we should.\n  As the truth-telling ranking Democrat on the Senate Budget Committee, \nthe Senator from North Dakota, said tonight, this budget hides the \nrising deficits that begin 6 years from now which will grow and grow \nuntil this Nation is so deep in debt that the rest of the world finally \nrefuses to keep loaning us $500 billion or more every year, and when \nthey stop, there will be, for all of us--our children and our \ngrandchildren--real hell to pay.\n  This budget is wrong. It is wrong for most Americans, wrong for \nAmerica, and wrong for those who are here tonight to approve it. I will \nvote against it, and I urge my colleagues to reject it also.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). Who yields time?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nRhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized \nfor 10 minutes.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the budget resolution \nconference report that is before us this evening. In spite of an \nexpected fiscal year 2006 deficit of $382 billion, this resolution \ncalls for an additional $106 billion of tax cuts over the next 5 years.\n  Reasonable tax cuts focused on energy incentives or educational \nincentives would not need special reconciliation instructions to \nprotect them because they enjoy widespread bipartisan support. They \nwould actually help our economy. But this resolution contains $70 \nbillion of unsound tax cuts that would be protected under \nreconciliation. They would require only 51 votes without any meaningful \namendments or debate to become law.\n  As part of these cuts, there would be $9 billion to accelerate estate \ntax relief and $23 billion for additional capital gains and dividend \ntax cuts. That amounts to $32 billion in tax cuts over the next 5 years \nthat will benefit only the very wealthiest members of our society, and \nthose tax cuts are paid for by cuts in programs that are vital to \nworking men and women and families across this country, such as $10 \nbillion in cuts to Medicaid.\n  Preliminary analysis of this budget by the Democratic staffs of the \nJoint Economic Committee and the House Budget Committee finds that well \nover 90 percent of the benefits from these $32 billion worth of tax \ncuts would be received by families in the richest fifth of the income \ndistribution, whereas almost half of the Medicaid cuts come at the \nexpense of families in the bottom fifth of the distribution. This is \nvery clear and very disturbing: tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans \nat the expense of health care for the poorest Americans. That is what \nis in this budget. It is wrong. It is unfair. It is unjust. Nearly \nthree-quarters of the Medicaid cuts hurt the poorest 40 percent of \nfamilies, and there are also cuts in discretionary spending that will \nhit middle-income families.\n\n  In addition to these very difficult and unwise cuts, there are \nspecial reconciliation instructions to increase the debt limit. This is \nan attempt to disguise the irresponsible fiscal policy of the \nRepublican administration and this Republican Congress. We understand \nthat this budget, as the Senator from North Dakota pointed out, is \ngoing to increase our deficits without limit over the next several \nyears. Increased deficits hurt our economy. They erode investment. They \nnecessitate foreign borrowing from countries such as China and Japan. \nEventually, we will have to pay back what we have borrowed and \neventually this foreign borrowing and lack of investment will undercut \nour quality of life and our standard of living.\n  Large budget deficits are now also forcing us to make the unfair \nbudget cuts I just discussed, cuts to Medicaid and other programs that \nare essential to families throughout this country. We are asking the \nmost vulnerable people in our country, those least able to afford \ndenial of these benefits, to pay for tax cuts of the very wealthiest.\n  At a time when the number of uninsured Americans is growing and our \nhealth care system is in a crisis, as health care is becoming \nincreasingly more expensive and unaffordable, the Republicans are \nproposing a $10 billion cut in Medicaid. This will force States to \nabandon thousands of Americans who currently now depend on these \nprograms for health care. The poor, the sick, and the disabled are \npaying for tax cuts for wealthy Americans.\n  These effects are not just on these individuals, but they will affect \nwhole communities. In 2003, the Institute of Medicine prepared a report \ncalled A Shared Destiny, and it pointed out as one cuts away at the \nfoundations of health care in this country, the Medicaid system, the \npublic health system, that we pay for it in terms of the declining \nquality of our overall health care system. We pay for it in terms of \nour reduced access to care in emergency rooms due to overcrowding, and \nwe pay for it in terms of lost productivity as Americans without health \ncare become sick and do not work because they cannot work.\n  A recent State-by-State analysis by Families USA found that the \nimpact in my home State of Rhode Island of cutting Medicaid by $10 \nbillion would be 600 fewer seniors served and an $11 million reduction \nin Medicaid reimbursements.\n  These reductions will be devastating for my State and other States. \nIt will be unlikely that my State can as easily handle its commitments \nthrough innovative programs such as the medical assistance program and \nits employer subsidy program called RIte Share, which is designed to \nhelp small businesses pay for the health care of their workers so that \nthese workers are not exclusively dependent on State and Federal \nprograms.\n  I have been visited over the last few weeks by hospital \nadministrators, doctors, disability groups, and countless patient \nadvocacy groups. They have one message: Do not cut Medicaid. It is \nvital to people. It is essential to our States. But that is exactly \nwhat this budget does. It does not represent the priorities of the \nAmerican people. The vast majority of Americans understands we have to \nprovide at least a minimum level of health care for our citizens.\n  This budget is also going to result in deep cuts to community \ndevelopment\n\n[[Page S4519]]\n\nprograms and housing programs. Although CDBG funds have been restored, \nit cuts deeply at other programs, over $100 million in cuts from \nHousing for Persons with Disabilities; $14 million from Housing for \nPersons with AIDS; $24 million from Rural Housing and Economic \nDevelopment; $24 million from Brownfields programs; almost $286 million \nfrom HOPE VI Programs; $226 million from Section 8 Project-Based \nAssistance; $252 million from the Public Housing Capital Fund; and on \nand on.\n  This budget hurts the most vulnerable members of society to benefit \nthe wealthy. It is not fair, it is not just, and it is not wise policy.\n  This budget also had a chance to do something positive, to retain the \nKennedy amendment to help fund educational programs such as TRIO Upward \nBound, TRIO Talent Search, GEAR UP, and LEAP. It did not support the \nKennedy amendment and indeed it seeks $7 billion in additional cuts to \nstudent loans. This program reflects irresponsible fiscal policies that \nhave been with this administration from the beginning.\n  When the President took office in 2000, the public debt was $3.4 \ntrillion and falling. If we take this budget resolution and pass it, \nthe face value of public debt will be $6.2 trillion by 2010 and rising. \nIn fact, the more realistic assessment will probably put it higher. We \nare adding to the burden of our country. We are adding to the burden of \nthe next generation of Americans. These irresponsible fiscal policies \nare hurting us and this budget contributes to those policies. It \njeopardizes our future as it undercuts the safety and security of so \nmany families today.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Rhode Island for \nhis remarks. He is one of the most thoughtful Members of the body on \neconomic issues. He is a member of the Joint Economic Committee and I \nvery much value his good counsel.\n  I note the Senator from New Jersey is present. How much time does the \nSenator from New Jersey seek?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I would appreciate having 10 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from New Jersey and \nwelcome him to the floor as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized for \n10 minutes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from North Dakota \nand commend him for his excellent job in the presentation that he has \nmade.\n  While we are talking about the budget, one cannot help but think \nabout what is not in the budget but that the country is paying for. We \nare talking about emergency supplementals, costs attributed to the war \nin Iraq, help for Afghanistan, $80 billion recently passed. The one \nthing the public is not fully aware of is we are not paying in the \ntraditional manner for these costs.\n  It is painful to see how much we are devoting to the war, what the \nlosses are, while our soldiers and other service people conduct \nthemselves bravely in a very difficult situation. I hope what I am \ngoing to say is not the condition, but this could go down as one of the \nmost painful of the wars that we have seen. We are not talking about \nthe numbers. What we are talking about is the morass we have gotten \nourselves into.\n  The confusion was confirmed and the failure to do what we were \nsupposed to was confirmed when on April 25, a few days ago, there was a \nfront page story in the New York Times and the headline is, Bloodied \nMarines Sound Off About Want of Armor and Men. Now, these are brave \nmen. They have been in combat.\n  I will take the liberty of reading a couple of paragraphs from this \narticle, May 29, 2004, about a year ago.\n\n       A station wagon that Iraqi insurgents had packed with C-4 \n     explosives blew up on a highway in Ramadi, killing four \n     American marines who died for lack of a few inches of steel.\n       The four were returning to camp in an unarmored Humvee that \n     their unit had rigged with scrap metal, but the makeshift \n     shields rose only as high as their shoulders . . .\n       There was a picture of the humvee shown, and shrapnel from \n     a bomb that was used to attack them went over the top level \n     of the armor.\n       ``The steel was not high enough,'' said Staff Sgt. Jose S. \n     Valerio, their motor transport chief, who along with the \n     unit's commanding officer said the men would have lived had \n     their vehicle been properly armored. ``Most of the shrapnel \n     wounds were to their heads.''\n       Among those killed were Rafael Reynosa, 28-year-old lance \n     corporal from Santa Anna, Calif, whose wife was expecting \n     twins, and Cody S. Calavan, a 19-year-old private from Lake \n     Stevens, Wash., had the Marine Corps motto, Semper Fidelis \n     tattooed across his back.\n\n  The point of my remarks is a reflection of a trip I and several other \nSenators took in March of 2004. The soldiers we met with at that time \npleaded for three things: One, body armor. One of them said to me: \nSenator, the vests you are wearing are the best vests that can be \npurchased. That vest is the most protective, but we don't have those \nvests, Senator. Members of the coalition have them.\n  He said, Senator, I will tell you what else we need. We need armor on \nour humvee. We don't have it, and we pay a terrific price for it.\n  Another soldier said there is a new rifle, an M-4, a substitute for \nthe M-16. It is the best weapon you can get, and it has electronic \nsighting and can hit a target 600 feet away. It is light and easy to \ncarry. We don't have them.\n  We are now with a group of soldiers, Marines, talking about what they \nexperienced in this period. It was painful to read, and yet when one \nconsiders the amount of money we have spent on the war effort, the \namount of concealment when this money is put in the form of a \nsupplemental--a ``supplemental'' for the information of those who do \nnot understand the jargon, supplemental is an emergency supplemental. \nIt is money spent that does not have to be paid for by an assignment \nfrom regular revenues or other sources of funding. It is kind of a \nconcealed thing.\n  When I think about what is being concealed from the American public \nwith this war going on, now over 1,500 have lost their lives, thousands \nof our soldiers, sailors, Marines--I include all of them when I say \nsoldiers--having severe wounds from the dastardly attacks with roadside \nbombs and grenade launchers.\n  The subject came up just now that relates to an amendment I \nintroduced last year, an amendment to the defense authorization bill, \nto permit dignified media coverage of the return of flag-draped coffins \nto our Nation. I offered this amendment because the administration \nbanned media coverage of the ceremonies at Dover Air Force Base in \nDelaware when those fallen heroes were brought back to American soil.\n  In my view, these soldiers deserve to have the honor of public \nacknowledgment of the price they have paid, of having those families \nable to look at something that reminds them their son or their daughter \npaid the price for our democracy. And they were hiding that \ninformation.\n  Unfortunately, my amendment was defeated in the Senate. But that was \nnot the end of the issue. Since the Pentagon was not allowing the press \nto photograph these ceremonies, a professor of journalism filed, under \nthe Freedom of Information Act, a request to get the Pentagon to hand \nover the official photos from these ceremonies.\n  Just this week the Pentagon, under essentially court order, finally \nhanded over hundreds of these photos. These photos were changed. In \nfact, they were defaced by the Pentagon. The question is, if you look \nat these photos, and you see the honor guard that was carrying the \ncasket, flag-draped coffin to a place of rest, to a place of honor, \nthey had their faced blacked out. Were they doing something shameful? \nPicture after picture, there is a whole contingent of service people, \nall with their faces blocked out.\n  I wanted to distribute these photos to every Senator's office if they \ndo not already have them. We look at row after row of soldiers with \ntheir faces blocked out--heroes. Why are they hiding their faces? \nBecause they don't want the truth told about this war.\n  A picture of a flag-draped coffin. Shouldn't it be seen by the \npublic?\n  I have a photo gallery, I call it, in front of my office door, \nshowing proudly the faces of those who paid the supreme price for their \nloyalty to country. People look at those photos. They see they are \nyoung people. They see they are people who come from every State in the \ncountry. We want it to be known who these people were and what they did \non behalf of their country.\n\n[[Page S4520]]\n\n  The honor guard, the soldiers at these ceremonies, had black squares \ncovering their face as if they were embarrassed to be there. It is an \nhonor to participate in that ceremony. They would not want their faces \nhidden.\n  Frankly, I don't understand the thinking. When I go to the funeral \nwhen one of our people have fallen, it is a dignified, beautiful \ncommemoration of the person we were honoring. We should honor those who \nhave fallen in Iraq and Afghanistan. We have now lost over 1,500 \ntroops. They deserve honor.\n  This is not a political issue. It is an issue of respect. The \nsoldiers we have lost overseas are more than numbers. They are sons, \ndaughters, fathers, mothers, husbands, and wives. Of course, in my \nservice in the Senate, I have had the honor of attending funerals for \nthe fallen from New Jersey, in New Jersey and at Arlington National \nCemetery. The honor guard, dignified, looking strong, fit, determined, \nperfect unity and discipline, perform the same ceremony for every \nsoldier, whether it is in a small town in New Jersey or at the cemetery \nof our heroes at Arlington.\n  The Honor Guard meticulously lifts the flag off the coffin, folds it \ncarefully in precise form, and hands that folded flag, folded into a \ntriangle, to the surviving spouse or parent. It is a very somber and \npowerful experience.\n  I watched the flag being handed from a top cover on a coffin in \nArlington Cemetery, brought over to the mother of this young man, and \nshe hugged it like she was hugging her son.\n  After the 1983 terror attack in Beirut, Lebanon, 243 flag-draped \ncoffins of fallen marines were met by President Reagan on the tarmac at \nDover. The ceremony was open to the press, and the American people had \na chance to witness it.\n  We need to follow that example now. I have a simple message for the \nPresident and Secretary Rumsfeld: Honor our soldiers. I urge President \nBush to reverse course and allow the American people to join in \nhonoring our fallen troops. Let's not block the cameras. Let's not \nblock the faces. Let's not distort the truth. Let's honor our men and \nwomen in uniform together as a country.\n  Let it be known that there is a sacrifice that touches families \nacross this country. The face of a young man or a young woman who gave \ntheir life for their country ought to be recognized and not in any way \nhidden, whether in life or when the remains are returned to this \ncountry. Let the American people see the price that some families have \npaid for this war.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I yield 6 minutes to the Senator from New \nMexico, Mr. Bingaman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized for \n6 minutes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague and commend him for \nthe good work he has done on this budget and pointing out the flaws in \nthis budget resolution which I agree with him on.\n  I want to speak for a moment about the provisions related to health \ncare that are in the budget resolution.\n  There are 53 million of our Nation's most vulnerable children, \ndisabled, and elderly citizens who rely on Medicaid for their well-\nbeing and their livelihood. And there are 45 million Americans without \nhealth insurance coverage in this country, including over 400,000 in my \nhome State of New Mexico.\n  The administration offered a budget proposal to us that added $140 \nbillion for health care spending. Even with the proposed reductions in \nMedicaid spending, which they also recommended, the President was \nproposing a net increase of $80 billion for health care.\n  In contrast to that proposal, the budget before us tonight provides \nno spending for the uninsured and provides a cut in Medicaid of $10 \nbillion over 4 years. This is even more of a cut in Medicaid than what \nthe administration effectively proposed because the administration's \nbudget proposal only got a scored savings of $7.6 billion in Medicaid \nover 5 years. So it is $140 billion short of the President's proposal \non the uninsured, and the cut for Medicaid is scored at greater than \nthe level of cut that the President's budget called for, according to \nCBO.\n  In the name of reducing the deficit, this budget actually manages to \nincrease the deficit and still cuts funding for the uninsured and our \nNation's most vulnerable children, elderly, and disabled citizens who \nrely on the Medicaid Program.\n  It is estimated that a cut of $10 billion in Medicaid, as is in this \nresolution before us, will translate to almost $100 million in Medicaid \ncuts to my State of New Mexico over the next 4 years. The Medicaid \nProgram in New Mexico is already more efficient and less expensive than \nprivate sector health care, and it has been cut repeatedly over the \nlast few years as the State tried to address declining revenues and \ngrowing needs.\n  There is no doubt that any Federal reductions in Medicaid dollars to \nmy State of New Mexico will translate into a reduction in services, a \nreduction in benefits, and a reduction in coverage for our State's most \nvulnerable citizens.\n  Governor Richardson is a great Governor, but he cannot magically \nproduce the $100 million that the Federal Government would cut from our \nState under this budget proposal. Despite assertions that cutting $10 \nbillion from Medicaid will have no impact on the health and well-being \nof our Nation's most vulnerable citizens, even the best circus elephant \nor donkey cannot pull off such a feat.\n  Furthermore, Medicaid is far from broken, as some have claimed. The \ncost per person in Medicaid rose just 4.5 percent from 2000 to 2004. \nThat compares to just over 7 percent in Medicare and 12.6 percent in \nmonthly premiums for employer-sponsored insurance. If that is the \ncomparison, Medicaid seems to be about the most efficient health care \nprogram around, even more so than Medicare.\n  The overall cost of Medicaid is going up largely, not because the \nprogram is inefficient, but because more and more people find \nthemselves depending on this safety net program for their health care \nduring a recession. While nearly 5 million people lost employer \ncoverage between 2000 and 2003, Medicaid added nearly 6 million to its \nprogram. Costs rose in Medicaid precisely because it is working--and \nworking well--as our Nation's safety net health program.\n  Consequently, Medicaid now provides care to 53 million low-income \nAmericans, including nearly one-quarter of all New Mexicans.\n  For these reasons and many others, I cannot support the budget \nresolution before us today.\n  I would like to emphasize, however, that things would have been far \nworse if not for the hard work and leadership of Senator Smith, with \nwhom I offered an amendment to the Senate budget resolution that \ncompletely eliminated the $15 billion in planned cuts to Medicaid.\n  Senator Smith has shown a dedication and understanding of the \nMedicaid program and its importance to the 53 million Americans that it \nserves that should be applauded.\n  Due to his dedication, we have a budget before us that has $10 \nbillion in Medicaid cuts. But it is certainly far better than the $15 \nbillion in the original Senate budget resolution or the $20 to $38 \nbillion in the original House budget resolution or the $60 billion \noriginally proposed by the President.\n  I also commend every single Democratic Senator for, first, signing a \nletter to President Bush opposing block grants or arbitrary caps or \nlimits on Medicaid spending to the States earlier this year and for \nvoting unanimously to eliminate any Medicaid cuts to the budget \nresolution.\n  I also thank the more than 200 national organizations that supported \nthe Smith-Bingaman amendment to the Senate budget resolution and urge \nthem to stay active over the coming months to continue to oppose \nMedicaid cuts.\n  Before closing, I would like to strongly express the need to \nundertake any reform or changes to Medicaid on a bipartisan basis. \nSenator Smith and I, along with a majority of the Senate and an \noverwhelming majority in the House of Representatives, have all voted \nin favor of the creation of an independent, bipartisan Medicaid \nCommission.\n\n  Why a commission? Just like Social Security, just like the 9/11 \nCommission which examined the intelligence system, and just like \nMedicare, we believe\n\n[[Page S4521]]\n\nthat Medicaid deserves a comprehensive and thorough examination of what \nis working and what is not by all stakeholders--Federal officials, \nState and local government officials, providers, consumer \nrepresentatives, and experts.\n  If the Congress fails to accede to the majority sentiment in both the \nSenate and House and pass S. 338, the Bipartisan Medicaid Commission \nAct of 2005, then Senators Smith and I, on a bipartisan basis, believe \nthat we should have the National Academy of Sciences' Institute of \nMedicine, or IOM, undertake such a review of Medicaid.\n  Medicaid is 40 years old this year and deserves a thorough review \nfrom top to bottom by an independent, bipartisan, and well-respected \ngroup such as the IOM. The purpose of such a commission would be to \nreport on short- and long-range recommendations to improve coverage and \naccess to care, quality, and cost-effectiveness of services for low-\nincome and vulnerable populations served by the Medicaid program by \nDecember 2006. The 53 million Americans served by Medicaid deserve \nnothing less.\n  I would point out that, in response to questions from Finance \nCommittee Chairman Grassley earlier this year on FDA drug safety \nissues, Secretary Leavitt referred repeatedly to the ``prestigious \nIOM'' and how it was studying FDA drug safety issues and added that \n``we should move carefully before undertaking any restructuring, and \nlook forward to reviewing the results of the IOM study looking into \nthese matters, as well as working with FDA, Congress and outside \nstakeholders to ensure an efficient and effective system of drug \nregulation.''\n  Again, the 53 million Americans served by Medicaid deserve no less \nthan a similar review of the Medicaid program.\n  If a commission is appointed, instead, that is heavily weighted \ntoward the administration, it will be nothing more than a waste of \ntaxpayer money, as none of the recommendations will have bipartisan \nbuy-in or balance. Once again, we will have missed an important \nopportunity to improve the Medicaid program.\n  It is also why I firmly believe we need to make sure that we do \nwhatever we do right rather than quick. Senator Coleman said it well \nwhen he said we should ``measure twice and cut once.''\n  Medicaid is the backstop to Medicare, the backstop to private \ninsurance, and the major funding source for our Nation's safety net \nproviders. Medicaid is, as Health Affairs has called it, ``the glue \nthat holds our nation's health care system together.'' Therefore, we \nmust make sure reform is done right and systematically, rather than \nquickly and without being thought through.\n  Finally, during the last Presidential election, the President \nrecognized that 9 million children lacked health care coverage and made \na proposal that he called ``Cover The Kids.''\n  In the President's own words:\n\n       We'll keep our commitment to American's children by helping \n     them get a healthy start in life. I'll work with governors \n     and community leaders and religious leaders to make sure \n     every eligible child is enrolled in our government's low-\n     income health insurance program. We will not allow a lack of \n     attention, or information, to stand between millions of \n     children and the health care they need.\n\n  The President put that proposal into his budget, but I do not see it \nin this budget. As a nation, we should not be going backwards on \nchildren's health, but we will in this budget.\n  Furthermore, Congress is poised to adopt a Federal budget that \nprovides $70 billion in tax cuts for the wealthiest people while, at \nthe same time, it slashes funding for seniors and children who count on \nMedicaid for their very survival.\n  Consequently, I urge a vote against the conference budget resolution.\n  The votes are going to be here to adopt this budget resolution. I \nhope this commission we have called for and Senator Smith has insisted \nupon will be able to give good direction as to how this could be \nimplemented and how Medicaid can be improved long term.\n  Mr. President, with that I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I have been in the Congress some 30 \nyears. I have seen a lot of budgets. I have voted for some, and voted \nagainst others, but in all my days, I have rarely seen a more \nirresponsible budget than the one this Congress is about to approve. In \na time of rising debt and rising military expenses, we are also \nabsurdly living in a time of rising tax cuts.\n  Frankly, I am appalled. I am appalled at the fiscal irresponsibility \nof cutting taxes by $106 billion over the next 5 years, primarily for \nthe wealthiest among us, while our budget and trade deficits go up. It \nis no wonder the value of the dollar has plunged.\n  I am also appalled that this budget excludes future costs of the war \nin Iraq. In the past, we have sometimes raised taxes to pay for war \ncosts. I believe this is the first time this country has ever cut taxes \nand waged a war at the same time. I am tired of witnessing a shell game \nwhere it is claimed that a budget will lead to a reduction in the \ndeficit, while the President requests billions and billions of dollars \nin so-called ``emergency'' military spending.\n  At the same time this budget calls for increasing tax cuts, this \nbudget will mandate cuts in programs that benefit low-income Americans. \nA Federal budget is about setting priorities, and the priorities \ncontained in this budget are all wrong.\n  This budget puts tax cuts ahead of ensuring that our communities have \nclean water, safe streets, and good schools.\n  This budget includes $35 billion in cuts in mandatory programs such \nas the Food Stamp Program and Medicaid, which serves low-income \nchildren and their families, people with disabilities, and the elderly. \nI have a hard time voting for provisions that will simply increase the \nburden on States to care for low-income and disadvantaged Americans. \nThere are many other low-income programs that will need to be cut to \nfollow this budget blueprint ranging from affordable housing to \neconomic development and nutritional programs.\n  In short, this is a Sheriff of Nottingham budget. It takes from the \npoor and gives to the rich.\n  This budget assumes that funding for domestic discretionary programs \nwill be cut by 5.9 percent this year below the level enacted for 2005, \nadjusted for inflation. Over 5 years, these cuts are enormous and will \naffect practically every area of the domestic budget from veterans' \nhealth care to job training to special education.\n  I was not pleased at the cuts in the discretionary budget contained \nin the Senate-passed budget. This budget is worse. It will lead the \ncountry down the path towards cuts in environmental protection \nprograms, transportation programs such as Amtrak, and education \nprograms. This budget will also, unfortunately, enable those who favor \noil and gas exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to \nshield such a provision from full debate in the Senate.\n  I cannot support this budget resolution conference report because of \nits misguiding priorities. I regret that this budget will lower the \nquality of life for all Americans by not adequately funding important \ndomestic programs, increasing the deficit, and widening the divide \nbetween rich and poor in this country.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise to express my opposition to this \nconference report and explain why I will vote against it.\n  This is the beginning of my second term in the Senate and one of the \nreasons Ohio sent me back here is because they know that I am committed \nto doing something about balancing the budget and paying down the \ndebt-- fundamentally sound fiscal principles to which I have been \ncommitted throughout my career.\n  I must say that I have carefully examined this conference report and \nhad hoped to be able to vote in favor of it. And I found a great deal \nto like in this conference report. This is a very tight budget when it \ncomes to spending and I support that. In fact, I have to commend \nSenator Gregg and Congressman Nussle for producing the one of most \nfiscally responsible and honest budget resolutions I have seen in 7 \nyears in the Senate. It sets ambitious targets and forces the Congress \nto make hard choices about our spending priorities. This conference \nreport fully supports the efforts of President Bush to restrain the \ngrowth of discretionary spending while defending the nation. Let there \nbe no mistake, this conference report reflects the difficult,\n\n[[Page S4522]]\n\neven painful, spending policy decisions we have avoided for far too \nlong.\n  Unfortunately, spending policy is only one half of a budget and I \nsincerely wish the budget resolution also forced us to make equally \ndifficult choices about tax policy. This conference report contains \nreconciliation instructions for $70 billion in tax cuts we do not need \nand cannot afford.\n  Many of my colleagues insist on these reconciliation instructions \nbecause they would like to extend until 2010 all or some of the tax \ncuts enacted in 2001 and 2003. Moreover, they propose to extend these \ntax cuts without offsetting the revenues lost to the Federal \nGovernment. This is unacceptable.\n  First let me explain why we cannot afford to cut taxes this year.\n  According to CBO estimates the national debt increased by $600 \nbillion between October 2003 and October 2004 and will increase by at \nleast the same amount before October 2005. That is a $1.2 trillion \nincrease in Federal debt in just 2 years. And this conference report \ninstructs the Finance Committee to raise the debt ceiling yet again by \nover $700 billion.\n  Raising the debt limit has become an annual ritual. And why do we \nkeep raising the debt limit every year. It's because we keep borrowing \nmore and more money for spending instead of restricting the growth in \nfederal programs and/or raising the revenues to pay for those programs.\n  This is against a backdrop in which most experts agree that by 2030, \nspending for Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid alone will consume \n18 percent or more of GDP, about the same amount we are spending today \nfor all operations of Government combined.\n  Let me be very clear, borrowing for tax cuts now guarantees larger \ntaxes increases later.\n  Next, let me explain why we do not need to do any tax cuts at all \nthis year.\n  In January President Bush established a bipartisan panel to advise on \noptions to reform the tax code to make it simpler, fairer, and more \npro-growth to benefit all Americans. In July the Advisory Panel will \nsubmit to the Secretary of the Treasury a report containing options for \nreforming the Federal Internal Revenue Code. These options will help \nCongress: simplify Federal tax laws to reduce the costs and \nadministrative burdens of compliance with such laws; share the burdens \nand benefits of the Federal tax structure in an appropriately \nprogressive manner while recognizing the importance of homeownership \nand charity in American society; and promote long-run economic growth \nand job creation, and better encourage work effort, saving, and \ninvestment, so as to strengthen the competitiveness of the United \nStates in the global marketplace.\n  Essentially, we will be fundamentally reforming the entire tax code \nnext year, so there is absolutely no reason to tinker with it this \nyear. It would be like remodeling your kitchen the year before you tear \ndown and replace your house.\n  If for some reason, we do not act on the advisory panel's report, we \nwill still have plenty of time to reconsider extending existing tax \ncuts. Most of the current tax cut provisions do not expire until 2010 \nand even the reduced rates on dividends and capital gains do not expire \nuntil 2008.\n  I supported tax cuts in 2001, 2003 and 2004. Nevertheless, we face a \ndifferent situation today and I will not longer support tax cuts unless \nthey are fully offset. We have to take into consideration that even our \ncurrent sobering assessment of federal finances may be overly \noptimistic.\n  Assuming continued, but declining, spending for the global war on \nterrorism increases the 10-year deficit by $418 billion.\n  Assuming that discretionary spending keeps pace with economic growth, \nrather than inflation, increases the 10-year deficit by $1.4 trillion.\n  Even assuming that expiring tax cuts are only extended for 5 years \nincreases the deficit by $306 billion.\n  Assuming continuation of recent adjustments in the alternative \nminimum tax, AMT, increases the deficit by $642 billion.\n  Freezing appropriations, including defense, the war on terrorism and \nhomeland security, would save $1.3 trillion. However, if combined with \nthe extension of tax cuts and continued AMT relief, the budget would \nstill remain in deficit every year, totaling $2.2 trillion over the \nnext decade.\n  We must also remember that current Medicare payment increases for \ndoctors and hospitals expire at the end of 2005. The American Medical \nAssociation, AMA, reports that physicians would see a 31 percent \ndecrease in payments from 2006-2013. If we do not act, senior citizens \nwill face serious problems obtaining health care; but it will cost tens \nof billions to continue reimbursing doctors and hospitals at the \ncurrent rate.\n  I have consulted with experts like Federal Reserve Chairman Alan \nGreenspan, Comptroller General David Walker and financial expert Pete \nPeterson who share my concern about the federal budget and agree the \neconomy no longer needs the stimulative effect of extended tax cuts. \nThe nations gross domestic product grew by 4 percent in both 2003 and \n2004. Unemployment has dropped from 6.6 percent to 5.2 percent and new \njobs have been created every month for the last 21 months. The tax cut \nmedicine worked and it is time to stop before we overdose on too much \nof a good thing.\n  My basic yardstick for government spending, including tax cuts, has \nalways been ``is it necessary and is it affordable''. My colleagues who \nwant to cut taxes or increase spending should find the offsets to make \ntheir priorities affordable. If they cannot find such offsets, than let \nthem demonstrate the necessity of their initiatives by gaining 60 \nvotes.\n  I hope this statement explains my reluctant opposition this \nconference report.\n\n\n                                pension\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield.\n  Mr. ENZI. I would like to clarify a point with the chairman of the \nBudget Committee about the timing of substantive legislation and the \neffect on my Committee's instructions in the FY 2006 Budget Resolution, \nH. Con. Res. 95. The Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee is \ninstructed in this resolution to report $13.6 billion in reconciled \nsavings by September 16. It is contemplated that a significant portion \nof those savings will come from reforms to the insurance program of the \nPension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. While important, legislation \nproducing the anticipated savings is only a part of broader pension \nreforms that must be enacted this year in order to stabilize the \ndefined benefit system in this country. As the chairman knows, \nreconciliation is privileged legislation which is narrow in scope. Many \nprovisions that are essential to comprehensive pension reform may not \nbe permitted in reconciliation. Therefore, it may be necessary to act \noutside of the reconciliation process in order to enact comprehensive \npension reform. My question to the chairman is, if we pass legislation \nthat sets the stage for real savings to occur in reconciliation, will \nyou recognize those efforts in scoring our committee's response to the \nreconciliation instruction?\n  Mr. GREGG. Our scoring of reconciliation recognizes how your response \nfits within the overall legislative landscape. The answer to your \nquestion is yes.\n  Mr. ENZI. I thank the Senator.\n\n\n                          medicaid commission\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from New \nHampshire, Senator Gregg, Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, to \ndiscuss the creation of a Medicaid commission to assist Congress and \nthe administration in their task of modernizing Medicaid.\n  As my colleague knows, the Medicaid program under Title XIX of the \nSocial Security Act provides essential health care and long-term care \ncoverage to low-income children, pregnant women and families, \nindividuals with disabilities, and senior citizens. The program, in \nfact, provides health and long-term care coverage to approximately one \nin six Americans. Yet, I think we can all agree that Medicaid now faces \nfinancial challenges at both the State and Federal level that, over \ntime, will worsen and threaten the viability of the program. This \ncommission will help us address this challenge.\n  The members of this independent Medicaid commission will be appointed \nby the Secretary of Health and Human Services and will represent a \nbroad range of ideas and points of view. It will, for example, include \nrepresentatives of both the State and Federal\n\n[[Page S4523]]\n\ngovernments, individuals who are covered by the program, and those who \nprovide care and coverage under the program. The commission will be a \nfair and balanced forum to discuss the needs and challenges of the \nMedicaid system and to make recommendations that can assist \npolicymakers in improving the program.\n  I ask my colleague, Chairman Gregg, if he would describe the goals \nand the timeline of the commission.\n  Mr. GREGG. As the majority leader has described, the independent \ncommission will assist Congress and the administration by making \nrecommendations regarding the modernization of the Medicaid system.\n  The commission will have two primary tasks and two important \ndeadlines: It will make short-term recommendations on how to implement \nthe requirements of the budget resolution with respect to the Medicaid \nprogram. These recommendations will be contained in a report to the \nSecretary by no later than September 1, 2005. The commission will also \nmake long-term recommendations on how to modernize Medicaid. These \nrecommendations will be contained in a report to the Secretary by \nDecember 31, 2006.\n  I thank my colleague for his work to develop a commission, and I look \nforward to working with him and my colleagues on the Finance Committee \nas we consider the recommendations of the commission to help create a \nviable plan to modernize and strengthen Medicaid.\n  Mr. FRIST. I thank the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, we are moving toward completion of the \ndebate on this budget resolution. I want to be recognized for a minute, \nthen the Senator from North Dakota is going to be recognized, and then \nwe are going to return to discuss the specifics of the resolution for a \nbrief period of time between myself and the Senator from North Dakota, \nand then we are going to hear from the leaders, and then, hopefully, we \nwill vote.\n  But before we proceed further, and in recognition of all the work \nthat has gone into this resolution, I want to acknowledge one person on \nmy staff who is moving on, and she has had a tremendous commitment to \nthe Senate for many years. That is Gayle Osterberg.\n  Gayle has worked in the Senate for 12 years, starting out as a staff \nassistant in the office of Senator Don Nickles, and rising her way up \nto the position of communications director for, first, the HELP \nCommittee, when I was there, and subsequently went to the Budget \nCommittee where she has done an extraordinary job.\n  Gayle graduated from the University of Kansas in 1992 with a degree \nin communications and has effectively used her talent and knowledge of \nthe media to rise up the ladder in the Senate.\n  While she will be missed, Gayle is moving on to greener pastures and \nexciting times as vice president of communications for the Motion \nPicture Association of America. That should be a fascinating job and \none she will do very well. We will all miss her on the Senate Budget \nCommittee. We congratulate her, however, on her extraordinary years of \nwork and thank her very much and wish her good luck as she moves \nforward.\n  In addition, I want to thank my staff. I want to begin specifically \nby thanking the Senator from North Dakota. His courtesy, his \nprofessionalism, his fairness in dealing with us has been \nextraordinary, as has his staff. And I thank his staff for their \nexceptional commitment to the process.\n  The people listening to this debate over the last many hours may \nconclude we are quite antagonistic. Yes, we may be on some of the \npolicy issues, but, no, we are not, at the personal and professional \nlevel. I admire very greatly the professionalism of the Senator and his \nstaff.\n  I also especially thank my staff. These are folks who have worked \nendless hours. Very few of them have gotten any sleep for the last \nweek. And there have been other periods during the intensity of marking \nup and putting the budget together when very little sleep occurred.\n  They extraordinarily and professionally put together an exceptional \nproduct, headed up by Scott Gudes on the Budget Committee and by Vas \nChristopoulos on my personal staff.\n  There are a lot of people, too many names to actually mention. I \ndeeply thank them. I know the Senate thanks them because without these \nfolks who commit their lives to making sure the legislation that moves \nthrough this body moves through professionally and is done in a way \nthat we can take pride in, we would not be able to function as a \nCongress. The American people would not be as well served as they are.\n  I want to recognize two members of the Senate Budget committee staff \nwho exemplify the professionalism and, especially, the esprit de corps \nthat make our committee and this institution such a marvelous place. I \nknow that Senator Conrad joins me in taking a moment to single out \nthese two special individuals.\n  Lynne Seymour and George Woodall are two of our senior professional \nstaff members on what we call our ``non-designated staff.'' They lead \nour bipartisan administrative staff. Day in and day out they give 110 \npercent on behalf of the members and staff, whether Republican or \nDemocrat. Lynne and George are the people who really manage the \ncommittee, who allow the rest of us on the committee payroll to \nformulate and execute Federal budgets, to hold hearings, to review \nprograms and to communicate with each other and the rest of the world. \nThey are in charge of what some in private industry call ``enabling \nfunctions.'' That is an accurate description because Lynne and George's \nefforts enable the rest of us to move forward the legislative business \nof this Senate and the Nation.\n  After taking over as chairman of this committee a few months ago, I \nunderstood that Lynne and George work first and foremost for the United \nStates Senate and I quickly realized that Senator Nickles had left us \nin good hands. Lynne and George eased the transition and ensured that \nwe were able to move the Budget Committee's work forward. We hired and \nadded staff. We installed work stations and moved offices. Due in no \nsmall measure to their work ethic and high morale, we were able to move \nforward when the President's Fiscal Year 2006 budget was transmitted a \nmonth after I became Chairman.\n  Lynne Seymour served on the Budget Committee in the early 1980s and \nthen rejoined us in 1995. She is responsible for all the administrative \nfunctions for the committee which, as we all know, is no mean task. \nLynne is the manager for all nondesignated staff and serves as a \nliaison between the committee and other divisions of the Senate, such \nas the Secretary of Senate, Sergeant-at-Arms, Rules Committee, Ethics \nCommittee and Architect of the Capitol. From the committee's own \nbiennial funding to the development of a Continuity of Operations Plan, \nCOOP, for the committee, Lynne ensures that the committee's activities \nrun as smoothly as possible, especially through all the many \ntransitions and office moves that have occurred over the past few \nyears. Lynne is a dedicated individual that others know they can count \non, and we all do count on her. She is a positive, graceful force for \nthe majority and minority committee staffs, a consummate professional.\n  George Woodall has worked on the Senate Budget Committee for the last \n11 years. I have come to value his work a great deal. As the systems \nadministrator for the Senate Budget Committee, he keeps the technology \nflowing and the lines of communication open. Many of us wonder how we \nmanaged before blackberries and other current technology. Well, George \nmakes sure that the capabilities of technology do not become \nliabilities by keeping the PCs, fax machines, email, scanners, and \nnetworks running and keeping people connected whenever and wherever \nneeded.\n  Some people who work with George may not know he is also an ordained \nminister, actively involved in men's ministry, addictions ministry, \noutreach ministry and youth ministry. George's generosity and \nwillingness to share his gifts is part of everything he does, and the \nCommittee is better for it.\n  The Budget Committee staff is one of the finest I have had the good \nfortune with which to work. Lynne and George have each given their best \nto Republicans and Democrats alike and have served on the committee \nstaff for over a decade. I am privileged to recognize them and to \nexpress my gratitude.\n\n[[Page S4524]]\n\n  Mr. President, we all know it is our staff that somehow gets the work \ndone during weeks such as this one where the Senate has dealt with both \nthe highway bill and concluding a conference report on the budget \nresolution. As the new chairman of the Budget Committee, it was my \nchallenge in January to get the committee up and running immediately \ngiven that we had some of the first tasks in the Senate for the year. \nTherefore, it was necessary to have experienced staff that could step \nright in and make things work.\n  But it is not easy to have an instantly full, experienced staff, with \nall the bases covered. That is why I have been fortunate to be able to \ndraw on the experience of some of the best employees in the executive \nbranch. I would like to take a moment to recognize the brief but \nvaluable contributions of two executive branch detailees to the Budget \nCommittee--Elissa Konove and Mara Browne.\n  Elissa Konove came to the Budget Committee in February to be our \ntransportation analyst. In that role as an examiner at the Office of \nManagement and Budget, she had followed the daily track of the highway \nbill over the last 2 years. When the highway bill laid over to this \n109th Congress, Elissa decided to view the dance of legislation from \nthe inside out. I very much appreciate OMB Director Bolten's \nwillingness to share an analyst with such thorough knowledge and a \nsteady hand. I understand Elissa is going back to fight new fires where \nOMB needs her most, and I know they're happy to have her back. While we \nwill miss her expertise, we thank her for contributions, and we know \nthe executive branch will benefit from her experience in the Congress.\n  I also would like to recognize another valued addition to the Budget \nCommittee staff who will be leaving us in August, Mara Browne. Mara \ncame over to the Budget Committee from the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration, NOAA, where she served in the Satellite \nService working on international affairs and private remote sensing \nissues. Mara began her Federal career as a Presidential Management \nFellow and has been an asset to the committee in a number of areas, \nespecially within the general Government function. I thank Mara for her \ndedication to the efforts of the committee and wish her the best of \nluck in her future endeavors at NOAA.\n  Mr. President, I would also like to take a minute or two to recognize \njust a few of the talented professionals who have helped develop this \nbudget resolution.\n  First, I would like to acknowledge chairman Nussle and his very \ntalented staff. Jim Bates, Dan Kowalski, Paul Restuccia, and their team \nare simply first rate and the technical accuracy of this resolution and \nthe budget is simply a matter of personal pride.\n  Second, I want to acknowledge my own staff here on the Budget \nCommittee. I do not have time to recognize all of them but would like \nto mention a few--professionals like our legal staff, Gail Millar and \nAllison Parent. Our policy staff, led by Vince Ventimiglia, including \nKim Monk, David Fisher, Peggy Binzer, and Richie Weiblinger.\n  Since taking over the committee in January, I have been extremely \ngrateful to these committee staff who have worked tirelessly on the \nbudget, and in helping me take over as chairman. I just cannot say \nenough about Jim Hearn, Cheri Reidy, Dave Pappone, Dan Brandt and \nothers. I would be remiss if I did not mention Bill Lucia who we got to \ncome over from the HELP Committee. Bill handles education and income \nmaintenance functions and has done such incredible analysis of pension \nand student loan reform.\n  I want to thank our leadership staff for their tireless work on this \nresolution. I especially want to thank Sharon Soderstrom and Bill \nHoagland. They have been there to assist me and the committee on issue \nafter issue. They are true public servants. Through their knowledge, \ntenacity and interpersonal skills--they bring great credit to our \nleader and this institution.\n  Finally, I want to recognize one other special individual. Vasiliki \nChristopolulos. ``Vas'' has served with me since I moved from the \nGovernor's Mansion in Concord to join this Senate. Her official title \nis ``administrative assistant'' but I doubt that any title could \nadequately convey all the responsibilities that Vas assumes and carries \nout. Vas is what in Greek is referred to as ``apeeshetehtoh''--that is \nshe is simply ``amazing.'' I doubt there is any member of this Senate \nwho can point to a more dedicated and talented staff person. Vas makes \nmy office work, she makes the larger ``team Gregg''--from \nappropriations to budget to my offices in New Hampshire--work in a \nseamless, smooth manner. Vas is probably one of the warmest, most \ndecent people that has ever worked in this institution or in any \ninstitution. On a daily basis she brightens up the day for everyone she \ncomes in contact with. I cannot say enough to recognize her and express \nmy appreciation.\n  So, Mr. President, this is an institution that is known by the names \nof the 100 elected members that serve here. But, I just want to note \nthat there are many other names that are maybe less well known, but who \ntruly make the business of this Senate occur and happen in a way that \nserves Americans around the great Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the committee for \nhis fairness throughout the process, for his professionalism, and for \nhis good humor. We have spent many long days and nights on this floor \ndebating this budget. We have spent a long period in the Budget \nCommittee. It has been with unfailing good humor on his part and a \nsense of fairness and bipartisanship that we have moved forward. We \ncertainly don't always agree, but we have never been disagreeable. \nPerhaps that is a good model for the way we function in the Senate.\n  I will take a minute to thank Sue Nelson of my staff. This is her \nlast budget resolution. She has been with the Senate Budget Committee \nfor 20 years. She is my deputy staff director. She is the person who is \nin charge of our numbers and Medicare as well. She at one time worked \nfor Senator Domenici. We are going to miss the outstanding professional \ncommitment of Sue Nelson. We are going to miss you very much. Thank you \nfor all you have done for our committee and for the Senate.\n  I also thank my staff director Mary Naylor. Mary has put together an \noutstanding staff and has worked unfailingly for us to make our case on \nwhat the budget priorities of this country should be, and to the rest \nof my staff as well who have worked extraordinarily hard and with a \nreal commitment to fiscal responsibility and to fairness.\n  They are:\n  Sue Nelson, Deputy Staff Director;\n  John Righter, Appropriations;\n  Shelley Amdur, Education/Appropriations;\n  Lisa Konwinski, Counsel;\n  Jim Esquea, Medicaid/TANF;\n  Jim Klumpner, Economist;\n  Jamie Morin, Defense;\n  Rock Cheung, International Affairs;\n  Sarah Kuehl, Social Security/Transportation;\n  Steve Bailey, Revenues;\n  Mike Jones, Homeland Security/Justice;\n  Cliff Isenberg, Energy/Environment;\n  Jim Miller, Agriculture;\n  Stu Nagurka, Communications Director;\n  Steve Posner, Deputy Communications Director;\n  David Vandivier, Planning/Outreach;\n  Kobye Noel, Graphics Production Coordinator;\n  Matt Havlik, Staff Assistant;\n  Tyler Haskell, Staff Assistant;\n  Anne Page, Executive Assistant.\n  Let me also recognize the staff of the Senator from New Hampshire, \nespecially staff director Scott Gudes and the rest of the members of \nhis staff. This is a good relationship that we have between our two \nstaffs. It is one of respect and fairness, and we deeply appreciate the \nmany courtesies that have been extended to us during this process.\n  I want to echo the laudatory comments of Senator Gregg regarding the \noutstanding contributions made by two senior professional staff members \nof the Senate Budget Committee, Lynne Seymour and George Woodall. Lynne \nand George are our two most senior administrative staff members who \nperform their respective duties with great\n\n[[Page S4525]]\n\ndistinction. They are true professionals who serve the members of our \ncommittee and our respective staffs with poise, respect and diligence.\n  I have the utmost appreciation for their service, because they have \nattended to our committee during some of the most difficult \nadministrative challenges imaginable. For example, in just over 4 \nyears, since the beginning of the 107th Congress, this committee has \nhad four different chairmen: Senators Gregg, Nickles, Domenici and \nmyself. Thanks to the outstanding service of Lynne and George, the \ntransition from one chairman to the next has been flawless. They have \narranged for the moving in and out of our different staffs and the \nliteral moving of our offices several times. They made sure our offices \nwere properly equipped and that our computers, printers, phones, faxes \nand other technical equipment were in good working order--not an easy \ntask, I assure you.\n  They have also served our committee and this Senate during some of \nthe most difficult times. They were here on the morning of September \n11, 2001 when the Pentagon was attacked and when we believed the U.S. \nCapitol complex was also threatened. They were also serving our \ncommittee when anthrax was discovered in the mail system here in the \nSenate. These have not been easy times for staff members.\n  Lynne Seymour and George Woodall have not only persevered, but they \nhave excelled at their duties in serving us. I thank them for their \nservice, and want them to know how much we in the Senate appreciate \ntheir long hours, their unselfish contributions and their professional \nservice.\n  With that, I will proceed to wrap up. I will take a few moments and \nthen we will hear from the chairman and then the leaders, and then we \nwill be prepared to vote.\n  While I have great respect for the chairman, I have great respect for \nthe staffs that have assembled this budget, I deeply do not believe \nthat this budget charts the correct course for the country. I say to my \ncolleagues, if you want to be supporting more debt, vote for this \nbudget. If you want higher deficits, support this budget. If you \nbelieve that it is right to take every penny of Social Security surplus \nover the next 5 years and use it to pay for other things, then support \nthis budget.\n  This chart sums it all up. I call it ``building a wall of debt.'' \nThat is what this budget is all about. We have heard people say it is \ngoing to cut the deficit in half. I don't believe it. Instead, I \nbelieve what is going to happen is the debt of the United States is \ngoing to go up, up and away. We are starting with $8 trillion, and \nevery year of this budget debt is going to be increased by more than \n$600 billion. Every year it is going to go up by $600 billion.\n  Those are not my numbers. Those are the numbers from the budget \ndocument itself on pages 4 and 5 of this conference committee report. \nIt shows what is going to happen according to their own analysis and \nprojections to the debt of the United States: $683 billion the first \nyear, $639 billion the second, $606 billion the third, $610 billion the \nfourth, and $605 billion the fifth year. Anybody who says the deficit \nis getting cut in half and yet the debt is going up by over $600 \nbillion each and every year is mistaken. This is a mistake for the \ncountry. We ought not to support it. I urge my colleagues to defeat \nthis budget resolution. Let's go back to the drawing board. We can do \nbetter than this.\n  I thank the Chair and my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I thank the courtesy of the Senator from \nNorth Dakota and his staff and again thank my staff for the extremely \neffective way they have brought this process forward.\n  This is the only opportunity to get us on a game plan for reducing \nthe debt of the Federal Government, for moving forward in a process \nthat is going to bring fiscal restraint to the Federal Government. My \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle, for all their talk, have not \nput a budget on the table. This budget is a real document. It is a \nstrong game plan for moving down the road of establishing fiscal \nresponsibility here at the Federal level. It freezes nondefense \ndiscretionary spending for 3 years. That is real savings. For the first \ntime in 7 years, it steps onto the turf of entitlement and mandatory \nspending and begins the process of addressing two major issues which \nneed to be addressed if we are going to get our fiscal house in order, \nspecifically Medicaid and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.\n  In addition, it reduces the deficit in half over the next 4 years \nand, as a result of stepping onto the issues of Medicare and \nentitlements, it begins the process of correcting the outyear problems \nwe face as a nation which we should not be passing on to our children \nbut which we will pass on to our children if we don't begin to act now.\n  There has not been a budget in this Congress for 2 of the last 4 \nyears. It is time to act on a budget. It is our obligation, especially \nas the majority party, to put forward a game plan for how we as a \ngovernment are going to function and how we are going to move forward \nto act in a fiscally responsible way. This budget does that.\n  In addition, it will continue to energize and activate the very \nstrong economic recovery which we have seen over the last year. \nHundreds of thousands of jobs have been added. Revenues have increased \ndramatically. That is a result of the policies of this President. This \nbudget continues those policies in a manner which will continue that \neconomic expansion, give entrepreneurs the opportunity to be \naggressive, and create jobs for Americans.\n  It is a good budget, and it is a good place to start. It is something \nwe need to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I come to the floor to express my opposition \nto this budget resolution. Before I discuss the budget, I will take a \nminute or two to acknowledge the hard work of the chairman and ranking \nmember.\n  I have the greatest respect for the chairman of the committee. We \nserved in the House together. He left the House to become Governor of \nthe State of New Hampshire. He returned as a Member of the Senate. He \nis a knowledgeable man with knowledge of what goes on in our country. \nEven though I may disagree with his political ideology, as a person I \nhave the greatest respect for him. He is a person who always tells you \nhow he feels, and I think he adds a great deal to the Senate.\n  I especially thank our ranking member, Senator Kent Conrad, for his \noutstanding leadership for the people of North Dakota, the country, and \nour caucus. No one understands the budget better than Kent Conrad. We \ncould not ask for better leader on the budget than Kent Conrad. He and \nhis staff are exceptional. I told him earlier this evening, I really \nmiss this budget battle. For 5 years I sat with him on this floor and \nwas with him every minute of the way. And I enjoyed that. He is a man \nof vision and there is no one who knows numbers better than he does.\n\n  I oppose this budget for two primary reasons. First, it is fiscally \nirresponsible. Second, it makes the wrong choices and sets the wrong \npriorities. Let me talk about both of these problems for a short time. \nTo understand the current state of our Nation's fiscal policy, it is \nhelpful to review history. It always helps.\n  In 1992, the Federal Government ran a record deficit of $290 billion. \nIn 1993, with the Budget Deficit Reduction Act, without any support in \nthe House or the Senate from a single Republican, we made hard \ndecisions to get the budget under control. In fact, the Presiding \nOfficer on the night we had the vote was Al Gore, and he broke the tie \nto allow the Budget Deficit Reduction Act to pass. I can remember that \nnight and I will never forget it. George Mitchell assigned Tom Daschle \nand me to work to see if we could get Bob Kerrey's vote. That is a \nstory in itself. When we started looking for him, he had gone to a \nmovie--just like Bob Kerrey. Anyway, it worked out. Bob Kerrey decided \nto vote with the President and change history.\n  Largely because of those decisions made by us in this body, the \nbudget moved from record deficits to record surpluses. That is why in \nthe last 3 years of President Clinton's Presidency we paid down the \nnational debt. We were spending less money than we were taking in. \nUnheard of, but it happened 3 years in a row.\n  Unfortunately, one of the first acts of this administration and the \nRepublican-controlled Congress was to reverse the great strides we made \nin the\n\n[[Page S4526]]\n\n1990s. Instead of maintaining fiscal discipline and saving for the \nfuture, the Bush administration opted to provide lavish handouts to \nspecial interests and to the powerful. The result has been a record run \nof red ink as far as you can see.\n  Now, my distinguished friend, the chairman of the committee, said \nthat budget deficit is going to be cut in half. I cannot believe \nsomeone I bragged on so much a minute ago believes that. Last year, we \nran a deficit of--nobody knows how much because Social Security was \nused to mask a lot of it, but it was approximately $500 billion, the \nlargest ever. This year, according to the administration, the deficit \nwill even be larger. Running deficits of this size, of course, would \nalways be a concern. But at a time when we badly need to save to \nprepare for the baby boomers' retirement, such huge deficits are \nespecially irresponsible.\n  That is why it is so troubling that a budget resolution before us not \nonly fails to reduce the deficits, it makes it worse, much worse. In \nfact, this budget increases the debt each and every year by more than \n$600 billion and passes a burden of repaying the debt to my children, \nmy grandchildren, and my great-grandchildren.\n  What does this mean for Social Security? Under this budget, every \ndollar of Social Security surpluses would be taken and spent on other \nGovernment activities--every dollar. Think about this. We are going to \nhave a $2.5 trillion surplus in Social Security over the next 10 years. \nI say to all the people listening tonight, that is your money. We are \nsupposed to be saving it so we can pay your Social Security benefits in \nthe future. But does this budget save the surplus for Social Security \nbenefits? No. Every single dollar would be used for other purposes. \nThat is not fiscally responsible and it is not right.\n  This budget's irresponsibility is the first reason I oppose it. \nUnfortunately, the flaws go much deeper than that. This budget \nresolution also makes wrong choices and repeatedly shortchanges the \npriorities of working Americans. The budget cuts education--I could \ntalk about the budget cuts in education, but let's talk about adult \neducation. This budget cuts adult education by 60 percent. Who are \nthose people who need adult education? It is young men and women who \nhave dropped out of high school, people who, before finishing high \nschool went into the military; it is a lot of people for a lot of \ndifferent reasons who decide they want to come back and get an \neducation. A 60-percent cut. That is wrong. Health care, Medicaid, \nhomeland security--it targets rural America with cuts in agriculture \nand other programs. It slashes funding for new police officers. It cuts \nfunding for firefighting programs, and at a time when we are asking \nhundreds of thousands of our men and women to place their lives on the \nline, it forces them to pay more for their health care when their \nservice is done. While making deep cuts in priorities such as these, \nthe budget continues the recent pattern of Congress favoring special \ninterests and the powerful.\n  The budget calls for providing millionaires with additional tax \nbreaks worth over $35,000 a year, while doing nothing to close \nloopholes that allow huge corporations to avoid paying their fair \nshare--their fair share of paying for our Government responsibilities. \nIt calls for opening a pristine wilderness area in Alaska for the oil \nand gas industry. It calls for maintaining a large slush fund for HMOs \nwho have had record profits, and it calls for continuing to ban \nMedicare from negotiating with drug companies to get better prices for \nprescription drugs. That is hard to comprehend. Medicare cannot \nnegotiate for lower prices. They can go, like I do, to Rite Aid and get \ntheir prescriptions there, but no negotiating for prices. These, I am \nsad to say, are the priorities of the party in power. But the record \nshould be spread; they are not Democratic priorities, they are not the \npriorities of the American people, and they are certainly not the \npriorities of my friends and neighbors in Searchlight, NV. You see, in \nSearchlight, as in other towns and cities all across America, people \nare working hard and struggling to make ends meet. They are proud \npeople. They are not looking for handouts. They want their Government \nto be on their side in dealing with gas prices, which in Nevada average \n$2.70 a gallon. They want Congress looking out for them as they \nconfront skyrocketing health care costs and they want us, the Congress, \nworking to give their children opportunities for a good education, so \nthey can enjoy the promise of America, as all 100 Senators do.\n  Sadly, though, this budget wasn't designed with the people of \nSearchlight in mind. It doesn't address their needs. It won't make \ntheir lives any better and won't make our Nation stronger. It will make \nit weaker, more dependent on borrowing huge sums of money from Japan, \nChina, and Saudi Arabia.\n  For all these reasons, I believe the budget before us deserves to be \ndefeated. It abandons fiscal discipline and leads to an explosion of \ndebt. It takes Social Security dollars and uses them for other \npurposes, and it abandons middle-class Americans and those in need in \norder to give billions in breaks to the special interests and the \npowerful. I want everybody to know I am not the only one who feels this \nway.\n  I know that maybe there has been too much religion in the Congress in \nthe minds of some and I have not joined in that, but I am going to \ntonight. I have here a letter that is from the Episcopal Church of the \nUnited States of America, Evangelical Lutheran Church, the Presbyterian \nChurch, United Church of Christ, and the United Methodist Church. I \nread this:\n  This was issued today:\n\n       On March 8, we . . . issued a joint statement questioning \n     the priorities of President Bush's 2006 Federal budget. We \n     remembered the Gospel story of Lazarus and the rich man and \n     noted that the 2006 budget had much for the rich man but \n     little for Lazarus. It was our hope that Congress would take \n     action on behalf of ``Lazarus.'' Sadly . . . that has not \n     been the case. . . .\n       We believe our federal budget is a moral document and \n     should reflect our historic national commitment for those in \n     our own country who suffer from hunger, lack of education, \n     jobs, housing, and medical care, as well as concern for our \n     global community. There are good programs that can help solve \n     all these programs. We know, we have seen them work and we \n     are doing our part with our own programs. But we cannot do it \n     alone. Government must be a partner in providing \n     opportunities for our fellow women and men to pursue their \n     God given gifts. . . .\n       As we view the FY '06 Federal Budget through our lens of \n     faith this budget . . . continues to ask our nation's working \n     poor to pay the cost of a prosperity in which they may never \n     share. We believe this budget remains unjust. It does not \n     adequately address the more than 36 million Americans living \n     below the poverty line, 45 million without health insurance, \n     or the 13 million hungry children. Worldwide it neither \n     provides sufficient development assistance nor adequately \n     addresses the Global AIDS pandemic . . . We ask Congress to \n     reject the budget and begin anew.\n       We conclude . . . by asking that together we ``pledge \n     ourselves to creating a nation in which economic policies are \n     infused with the spirit of the man who began his public \n     ministry almost 2,000 years ago by proclaiming that God had \n     anointed him ``to bring good news to the poor.''\n\n  It is signed by the Most Reverend Frank T. Griswold, Presiding Bishop \nand Primate of the Episcopal Church of the United States, the Right \nReverend Mark Hanson, Presiding Bishop of the Evangelical Lutheran \nChurch in America, the Reverend Dr. Clifton Kirkpatrick, Stated Clerk \nof the General Assembly, Presbyterian Church, USA, the Reverend John H. \nThomas, General Minister and President, United Church of Christ, and \nMr. James Winkler, General Secretary, General Board of Church and \nSociety, United Methodist Church.\n  Mr. President, those are their words, not mine. I quoted it verbatim.\n  This is not just a bad budget. It is not just an unwise budget. It is \nan immoral budget. I urge my colleagues to reject it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. BURR). The majority leader.\n\n\n                      Unanimous Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the \nvote on the budget conference report, the cloture vote, with respect to \nthe Portman nomination, be vitiated; provided further, that the Senate \nresume executive session for the consideration of the nomination and \nthat there be 1 hour for Senator Lincoln and 10 minutes equally divided \nfor the chairman and ranking member; provided further, that following \nthat time, the Senate vote on the confirmation of the nomination, with \nno intervening action or debate; provided further, that following\n\n[[Page S4527]]\n\nthat vote, the Senate proceed to the cloture vote with respect to the \nJohnson nomination, notwithstanding the provisions of rule XXII, with \nSenator Carper to speak for 5 minutes and Senator Voinovich for 5 \nminutes before the vote; provided further, that upon the granting of \nthis request, the Bayh amendment No. 568 to the highway bill be \nwithdrawn.\n  Before the Chair rules, I will state further it is the understanding \nof Chairman Grassley that with this agreement, Senator Bayh has agreed \nto not reoffer his amendment or ask for a vote on the standalone \nmeasure prior to a review by the Senate Finance Committee at the July \nhearing.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I would like \nto speak for a few minutes on the Johnson nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The unanimous consent request is so amended. \nIs there objection to the unanimous consent request? Without objection, \nit is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in a few moments, we will be voting on the \nbudget resolution. I congratulate the distinguished chairman of the \nSenate Budget Committee, Senator Judd Gregg, for bringing before the \nSenate this evening the conference agreement on the fiscal year 2006 \nbudget. I would be remiss if I did not thank both the ranking member of \nthe committee, Senator Conrad, and the Democratic leader for their \ncooperation in allowing us to proceed with the conference report \nexpeditiously.\n  I know being chairman of the Budget Committee is a thankless task, \nand I know the chairman of the Budget Committee feels that way tonight \nas well. It is not the most glamorous of legislative committees in the \nCapitol, and being chairman of the Budget Committee does not win any \npopularity contests with any Senators, again, as the Budget chairman \nwill recognize.\n  Nevertheless, the working of this committee is absolutely essential \nto completing our fundamental constitutional responsibilities on all \nmatters fiscal. This is the first year the senior Senator from New \nHampshire has had this responsibility, and he has carried out his \nduties in a professional and businesslike manner.\n  It probably seems like ages ago, but it was only 12 weeks ago that \nthe President submitted his executive budget proposal to the Congress. \nWhen we complete work on this conference report shortly, we will have a \ncongressional budget. It is our blueprint for enacting spending and \nrevenue legislation for the remainder of the year, but it follows the \ngoals the President laid out in his budget to fund national security, \nextend expiring tax provisions, limiting the growth in nondefense \nspending, begin to address the growth of entitlements, and cut the \ndeficit in half in less than 5 years. While it may have seemed to the \nchairman and many other Members involved that this day would not \narrive, in truth, of the 27 budget resolution conference reports agreed \nto since the beginning of this congressional budget process in 1976, \nthis is the fifth quickest conference report ever agreed to. I \ncongratulate the chairman and his professional staff for this \naccomplishment.\n  Having said this, I think the chairman would agree with me that no \nbudget can meet all the demands and all the goals we have for this \ncountry. There are many issues that confront us, and some of those, \nsuch as national security, protecting the homeland, supporting \neducation and research, and providing basic benefits to needy Americans \nrequire resources. It requires making choices, and it also requires \nsetting those policies in place that will permit the economy to grow. \nFor in the end, the best way of serving the needs of this great country \nis with a strong and vibrant economy.\n  Meeting these goals by balancing Federal spending and limiting the \nburden of taxes on all Americans begins with this budget outline, the \noutline that is before us this evening. Once adopted, our work will \nonly begin as we fill in the details of the blueprint by passing \nspending and revenue legislation within the aggregate levels specified \nin the document.\n  Enforcing the blueprint means the chairman will not have a chance to \nrest much before he is back here watching over the building of our \nfiscal house for next year. Congratulations, again, to Chairman Gregg \nand his staff director, Scott Gudes, and all the staff who worked so \nhard to bring us to this point this evening.\n  To summarize, we will vote in a moment on the budget conference \nreport. Following this vote, we will proceed to the debate on the \nPortman nomination. We may not need a rollcall vote on that nomination. \nHowever, I remind my colleagues that we will have a cloture vote on the \nJohnson nomination tonight. Senators can, therefore, expect one to two \nadditional rollcall votes this evening following the vote on the budget \nconference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the conference report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of Conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the concurrent \n     resolution (H. Con. Res. 95), establishing the congressional \n     budget for the United States Government for fiscal year 2006, \n     revising appropriate budgetary levels for fiscal year 2005, \n     and setting forth appropriate budgetary levels for fiscal \n     years 2007 through 2010, having met, have agreed that the \n     House recede from its disagreement to the amendment of the \n     Senate, and agree to the same with an amendment, signed by a \n     majority of the conferees on the part of both Houses.\n\n  (The conference report is printed in the proceedings of the House in \nthe Record of April 28, 2005.)\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, as the clock strikes midnight, an historic \nevent will occur for all of us in the Senate, but obviously an \nimportant date in the history of Virginia. In all of our history, we \nhave had 51 Senators from the Commonwealth of Virginia, such as John \nTyler who became President, and Madison, and many great Senators. A \nhistoric achievement is being achieved tonight with my wonderful \npartner and our colleague, John Warner, which is a testament to his \nabilities as a leader and the high esteem in which he is held by the \npeople of Virginia.\n  Tonight, in fact at this very moment, our wonderful colleague John \nWarner surpasses on the all-time list Senator Carter Glass, who served \nin this body for over 26 years. Senator Warner's extraordinary term of \nservice is now second to only Harry Byrd in serving in the Senate.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session, and the clerk will report Calendar No. \n61.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Stephen L. Johnson, of \nMaryland, to be Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, as one who grew up in Danville and \nRoanoke, VA, as one who served in the U.S. Navy with John Warner as our \nSecretary of the Navy, I join my friend George Allen and all of you in \nsaluting him. It has been my privilege to serve under him as a naval \nflight officer for a number of years. It has been my privilege to serve \nwith him and with all of you for about the last 4 years.\n  During that time I have worked with a number of you on our side and \non the Republican side to try to find common ground with respect to \nissues such as class action, asbestos litigation reform, bankruptcy, \nthe next step in welfare reform, a comprehensive energy policy, a \nbusiness model for the Postal Service in the 21st century. The list \ngoes on.\n  As a former Governor, one who used to nominate people to serve in \ncabinet posts and judgeships, I have generally voted to confirm the men \nand women President Bush has nominated to serve on his team. In a \nnumber of instances I have gone well beyond just voting for a nominee \nof the President but advocating for them. I will give some examples. \nTommy Thompson was nominated for Secretary of Health and Human \nServices. I called him and said: Congratulations; how can I help you \nget confirmed and how can I help get your team confirmed? I did the \nsame thing with Tom Ridge when he was nominated for Secretary of \nHomeland Security. I did the same thing with Christie Whitman when she \nwas nominated for EPA, and I did the same thing for Mike Leavitt when \nhe was nominated to head EPA.\n  I stand before you tonight taking a different posture. I have never \nput a hold on any nominee in any time I have served here. It is not in \nmy modus operandi. But I have done it tonight and with a good man, \nStephen Johnson, who has been nominated by this President to lead the \nEPA. I am convinced if he is confirmed, he would do a good job.\n  I stand here tonight asking that we not confirm him at this time. I \nwill tell you why. For the last 3 years, I have been asking the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency to give us comparative data, comparing \nthe President's Clear Skies proposal, the proposal of Senator Jim \nJeffords, Susan Collins, and Joe Lieberman, and a bipartisan bill I \nhave introduced with several of you. We have asked for comparative \ndata, modeling that actually says this is what each of the bills will \ndo on the economic front. This is what they would do on the \nenvironmental front, and here is what they would do on the public \nhealth front.\n  I made that request first in 2002, again in 2003, again in 2004, and \nagain in 2005. I am not going to go into the litany of responses. My \nfriends, the response has been ultimately disappointing. We have tried \nto compromise. The administration offered us a deal. We have come back \nwith a counterproposal. We have not been able to find middle ground.\n  Tonight we end up with a decision to go for cloture. For those of you \nwho are going to vote no on cloture, I say thank you. For those who are \ngoing to vote yes, let me say this: My friends, I don't care who is \nPresident. I don't care who is running EPA. I don't care who is in the \nmajority here. When we are voting on issues such as clean air or clean \nwater or these kinds of issues and we need good scientific data, by \ngolly, we ought to get it. We should not have to beg for it. I don't \ncare who is running this place. We should get it. We should be able to \nmake these decisions based on good science. That is what I want.\n  The real tragedy, if Stephen Johnson is confirmed tonight--and I wish \nhim well if he is--is we have missed an opportunity not only to confirm \na good man, but we will have missed an opportunity to provide this side \nwith, frankly, the kind of scientific data we can go forward with and \nactually do a good bill, adopt a good clean air bill that will do a \ngood job in reducing sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and mercury, and \nslowing the growth of carbon dioxide. We have missed an opportunity if \nwe go forward tonight.\n  For those who are standing with me, I say thank you. For those who \nare not, I ask you to remember, someday we will have a Democratic \nPresident. Someday we will have a Democratic majority in this Senate. \nBe careful of the bed that you make, because someday you will get to \nsleep in it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise in support of the nomination of \nStephen Johnson to be Administrator of the EPA. This Senate should vote \nfor cloture and support this nomination.\n  As chairman of the Oversight of Government Management Subcommittee, I \nam very interested in the management of our Federal Government. Finding \nthe right people with the right skills to run our Nation's agencies is \nvery important. And President Bush has found the right person to lead \nthe EPA.\n  Mr. Johnson will be the first career official to hold the position. \nHe has worked at the EPA for 24 years and for 8 of the 9 EPA \nAdministrators. He knows the inner workings and personnel at the agency \nwhich may be exactly what is needed to manage it. He has managed \nvirtually every aspect of the agency's rulemaking process.\n  One of his strongest qualifications is he will be the first \nprofessional scientist to be the director of the Environmental \nProtection Agency. He has already been confirmed twice by the Senate as \nassistant administrator in 2001 and deputy administrator in 2004. There \nis a real need at the EPA to have him confirmed. The agency has had \nfour Administrators in 4 years.\n\n[[Page S4529]]\n\n  Mr. Johnson is serving as both deputy administrator and acting \nadministrator. The agency has a number of other open positions. It is \ncrying out for leadership. I imagine some of my colleagues are \nwondering why there is any controversy. I am the chairman of the Clean \nAir Subcommittee. The controversy over this nomination does not come \nfrom the EPW Committee as it overwhelmingly voted 17 to 1 in favor of \nhis nomination.\n  The ranking member, Senator Jeffords, stated, when he was nominated:\n\n       I applaud the decision to nominate Stephen Johnson to head \n     the EPA, and will work to move his nomination through the \n     Senate.\n  Senator Lieberman also was very complimentary about Mr. Johnson and \nabout the fact that he was qualified and that he was needed at the \nagency.\n  I wanted you all to know that we have been working for the last 4, 5 \nmonths to pass a bill to reduce powerplant emissions by 70 percent. \nSenator Carper and I, who are very good friends, have spent countless \nhours trying to compromise. He sent a letter to the EPA requesting an \nanalysis that would take several months to complete. Senator Carper has \nplaced a hold on a nomination because he wants information. Senators \nhave a right to information, but because he wants more analysis \nperformed, here are the facts: EPW has held 24 hearings on \nmultiemissions legislation. EPA has provided Congress with thousands of \npages of information. EPA career staff has stated this is the most \nanalyses they can ever remember being performed on a proposal.\n  Mr. President, I am particularly talking to my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle. We have more information than the whole \nCongress had when it passed the Clean Air Amendments in 1990. In May of \n2004, the Energy Information Administration performed an analysis \nsimilar to what Senator Carper is requesting. Last year, the \nadministration went much farther than I would have gone. They agreed to \ndo another comprehensive analysis to provide 12 pieces of information \non 4 proposals, including many of the things that we have been talking \nabout.\n  This is not a small analysis. It is going to take 6 to 8 weeks--did \nyou hear me?--to complete.\n  To reiterate, we have had four administrators in 4 years, and things \nare not getting done at the EPA. Unfortunately, Mr. Johnson's \nnomination is being held hostage because of an issue that pales--this \ndifference of opinion pales when you consider how desperately the EPA \nneeds a Director right now. We have to have somebody there to get the \nleadership.\n  As I say, I understand my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nhave said we are going to vote en masse against cloture. Johnson is a \ngood man. He is desperately needed at EPA, and I urge you to vote for \ncloture so we can confirm the scientist and the first career official \nto be administrator of the EPA. Thank you.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield back my time.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

PORTMAN TO BE UNITED STATES TRADE \n                             REPRESENTATIVE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the clerk will \nreport Executive Calendar No. 74.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Robert J. Portman, of \nOhio, to be United States Trade Representative.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the cloture motion \non the nomination is vitiated, and there is now 1 hour for debate under \nthe control of the Senator from Arkansas, Mrs. Lincoln, and 10 minutes \nequally divided between the chairman and the ranking member.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I certainly do appreciate my colleagues' \npatience this evening. I know that it is late. I apologize for keeping \npeople here late. I find it quite ironic that I come to the floor this \nlate in the evening under the same purposes as my colleague from \nDelaware, Senator Carper. Most of it is out of disappointment in the \nlack of response from this administration on an issue that I think is \nabsolutely critical to the fabric of this Nation, critical to our \nfamilies, and critical to our children.\n  I have asked that the Senate take time tonight to debate the \nnomination of Robert Portman to be the U.S. Trade Representative to \nhighlight some of the issues related particularly to Saudi Arabia that \nI believe deserve more time and attention than they have been getting. \nI certainly expect Congressman Portman will become involved with these \nissues in his new position.\n  I support the nomination of Congressman Portman to be our country's \ntop trade negotiator. I have met with him. I have served with him. I \nbelieve he brings the right skills to the position and that he will do \na very good job at representing our Nation and its vital interest in \nthat position.\n\n[[Page S4530]]\n\n  I look forward to working closely with him on many issues in the \nyears ahead that are important to my constituents, as I did with his \npredecessor. But today I would like to focus on one issue in particular \nthat is critically important to me, and that is the children of this \nNation.\n  In May of 2004, I wrote a letter to then-Ambassador Robert Zoellick, \nwith four of my Finance Committee colleagues, raising objections to \nSaudi Arabia's accession to the WTO. Over the past several years, our \nGovernment has been negotiating a bilateral trade agreement with Saudi \nArabia that I understand is now very close to completion. It is also \nthe only major hurdle which prevents Saudi Arabia from being granted \nfavored trading status with the United States and other WTO member \nnations.\n  In our letter, we specifically raised concerns regarding Saudi \nArabia's participation in the Arab League boycott of Israel and the \nappropriateness of our Government supporting its admission as a result, \ngiven that current law requires the United States to vigorously oppose \nstates that implement that boycott.\n  We also highlighted concerns regarding Saudi Arabia's efforts to stop \nthe financing of terrorist activities from sources within Saudi Arabia.\n  Finally, we objected to Saudi Arabia's continued refusal to respect \nthe rights of American women and girls who may never have a meaningful \nopportunity to leave the Kingdom even as adults. My concerns about the \nrights of American citizens is one I feel deeply about on a personal \nlevel, as a proud citizen of this great Nation, as a mother, and \ncertainly as a Senator from the great State of Arkansas, with \ntremendous responsibilities to those I serve.\n\n  Needless to say, when I received a response to our letter last week, \n11 months after we sent the letter to the administration--we received a \nresponse last week from our Acting Trade Representative 2 days before \nCongressman Portman's confirmation hearing--it only referenced the \nboycott and did not make one reference to the other two issues. I was \ndeeply troubled, and I hope others will be, too.\n  I was even more alarmed to read press reports about our trade \nnegotiators working around the clock to finish the agreement prior to \nthe meeting between President Bush and Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah in \nCrawford, TX, this last Monday.\n  I want to start at the beginning of this story regarding the rights \nof American citizens because I think this issue is very important. Over \nthe past several years, I have worked with Congressman Dan Burton of \nIndiana and others to highlight our Government's failure to \naggressively defend the rights of American women and children in Saudi \nArabia. This issue came to my attention because Heidi Al-Omary from \nJonesboro, AR, was abducted by her Saudi-born father in 1997. Saudi \nArabia continues to invoke its law and religion to detain my \nconstituent in violation of U.S. law and a valid court order.\n  Heidi was abducted more than 7 years ago, and she has been stuck \nthere ever since because the Saudi Government does not believe Heidi's \nfather, who is a wanted fugitive in our country, has done anything \nwrong. This man used our legal system to gain access by pressing the \njudge for unsupervised visitation, knowing full well that the first \nunsupervised visit and the child would be gone. Her mother knew that. \nHer mother argued with the judge, and the judge said: I have to give \nthis man the visitation rights. On the first unsupervised visit in the \ndead of the night, that woman lost her child. She was taken from her. \nShe did not see her child for 5 years. I do not know how we can stand \nby and let that happen.\n  I attended a Little League game with my boys recently. I sat in that \nfield and I thought how blessed I am to be a part of these children's \nlives. Then I thought of this poor woman whose child was taken from her \nagainst our laws, and for 5 years she missed those precious years of \nthat child's life.\n  Earlier tonight, waiting on these votes, I sat in a dark room with my \nchildren as they said their prayers. That woman has not had that. She \nhas not experienced that blessing because her child was taken from her. \nShe was only allowed to see that child 2 years ago, under restrictive \nsupervision.\n  That is not what we are about in this country. We are about standing \nup for our children and the citizens of this great land. We have an \nopportunity to do it, and we should.\n  Heidi's mother Margaret McClain resides in my home State, in \nJonesboro, AR. In July of 2002, Ms. McClain was permitted to travel to \nSaudi Arabia to visit her daughter. She was brought there under the \nassumption that she would have a visit with her child. When she \narrived, the visit had been moved. She traveled through the desert to \nsome unknown place where she finally got to meet with her daughter with \npeople breathing down her neck. After 5 years, when her child was taken \nfrom her in the dead of the night, she finally gets to see her. It is \nunbelievable to me that that child was taken from this country in 1997 \nand it took us until 2002 to ask for her return.\n  Ms. McClain spent 6 days traveling to and from Saudi Arabia, yet Mr. \nAl-Omary permitted her to spend only a few hours with Heidi during that \ntrip. Prior to that visitation, Ms. McClain had not seen or spoken to \nher child since she was taken from her from the United States 5 years \npreviously.\n  During Ms. McClain's first trip to Saudi Arabia in July of 2002, Mr. \nAl-Omary acted in a verbally abusive manner toward her, took steps to \ndisrupt Ms. McClain's planned visit with her daughter and, in addition, \nofficials at United States diplomatic installations in Saudi Arabia \nreported at the time that Mr. Al-Omary was uncooperative in arranging \nUnited States Consular visits with Heidi.\n  At one point following Ms. McClain's visit to Saudi Arabia, Mr. Al-\nOmary demanded the United States Government send him a letter of \nappreciation for allowing Ms. McClain to visit her daughter who he had \nkidnapped before he would authorize future United States State \nDepartment welfare-and-whereabout visits with their daughter Heidi.\n  Thankfully, our Government did not send Mr. Al-Omary a thank-you \nnote, and a subsequent welfare-and-whereabout visit did occur after \npressure was applied by United States and Saudi officials.\n  In May of 2003, after months of preparation by Ms. McClain, my \noffice, and the Vice President, Ms. McClain and Heidi's two adult \nsiblings were permitted to travel to Saudi Arabia to see Heidi a second \ntime. Ms. McClain was permitted greater access to her daughter compared \nto the first visit, but Mr. Al-Omary refused to grant a simple request \nto spend time alone with her daughter. Ms. McClain is now making \npreparations for a third trip to Saudi Arabia to visit her daughter \nagain this summer.\n  I believe in communicating. I believe in working hard to get along. \nVisitation and communication between the left-behind parent and an \nabducted child is important and should be encouraged. However, after \nmore than 7 years we ought to do a little bit more than just talking \nabout more travel dates and more plane tickets. We should be talking \nabout bringing a young American citizen home.\n  For too long, it seems, the U.S. Government's goal in difficult cases \nsuch as this has been to simply maximize visitation and contact between \nU.S. parents and their abducted children in an effort to avoid \nconfrontation with foreign governments. We know there are sensitive \nsituations and sensitive relationships with countries all across the \nglobe, but you do not gain respect until you demand respect in the \nrelationships that you hold.\n  We in no way have acted aggressively enough in demanding the respect \nfor the laws of our land and the citizens, particularly Heidi, who are \nbeing held against their will.\n  It is safe to say that I am not satisfied with the approach of just \nanother plane ticket and just another travel date. I firmly believe our \npolicy should be aggressively to seek recovery of abducted children, \nespecially when they are taken to a country in which women, regardless \nof their age, never achieve independence--a right we cherish as \nAmericans and we fight for.\n  In Saudi Arabia, women and girls are under the complete control of \ntheir fathers, husbands, or other close male relatives their entire \nlives. According to the State Department's Country Report on Human \nRights Practices most recent edition which was released in\n\n[[Page S4531]]\n\nFebruary of this year, all women in the country are prohibited from \ndriving and were dependent upon males for transportation. Likewise, \nwomen must obtain written permission from a male relative or guardian \nbefore the government would allow them to travel abroad. The \nrequirement to obtain permission from a male relative or guardian \napplied also to foreign women married to citizens of Saudi Arabia and \nto the minor and single adult daughters of Saudi fathers.\n\n  The report goes on to say that women have few political or social \nrights and were not treated as equal members of society. Women are \nrestricted in their use of public facilities when men are present. For \nexample, women must enter city buses by separate rear entrances and sit \nin specially designated sections.\n  Further, under Saudi law, women may not be admitted to a hospital for \nmedical treatment without the consent of a male relative. However, \naccording to the report, this was not always enforced, thank goodness.\n  Perhaps most troubling to me is that arranged marriages at an early \nage are socially acceptable in Saudi Arabia. Heidi is a young lady. She \nleft here as a child, abducted, taken against her will, and against our \nlaw. This summer, she turns 13. I am increasingly concerned that she \nmay be deprived of any meaningful choice about who she marries and when \nshe bears a child. Ultimately, Heidi's ability or inability to exercise \ncontrol over these most personal matters may very well determine if she \nis ever able to return to her rightful home in the United States.\n  I recognize the issue of international child abduction is not limited \nto Saudi Arabia. However, the status of female abductees in the Kingdom \nis quite unique since, under Saudi law and custom, women have very \nlimited autonomy and may never, ever have a meaningful opportunity to \nleave, even as adults.\n  As I mentioned earlier, I focused my attention on this issue because \nI don't believe our Government is doing everything it can to stand up \nfor the rights of American citizens such as Heidi. After studying the \nhistory of Heidi's case and others, I have sadly concluded that our own \nGovernment has failed to stand up for Heidi and others such as her. \nPerhaps most telling in this case is that even though Heidi is a U.S. \ncitizen and was kidnapped in August of 1997, our Government did not \nformally ask that she be returned until October of 2002. To me, that is \ninexcusable. It is why I think our Government owes this young girl an \nextra effort now, when she is most vulnerable, about to turn 13, about \nto have life-threatening decisions made for her without her consent, \nand without any of her emotional input.\n  To bring greater attention to this issue, in June of 2002, all 13 \nwomen Senators who were Members at the time sent President Bush a \nletter, asking him to take up the cause of American women and children \nheld against their will in Saudi Arabia. I received a response to this \nletter from the then-Secretary of State Colin Powell in November of \n2003. And that was 18 months after 13 women Senators wrote to this \nadministration specifically addressed to the President of the United \nStates. I only heard from the Secretary of State after I had placed a \nhold on the nomination of James Oberwetter to be our Ambassador to \nSaudi Arabia. In his letter, Secretary Powell stated that the State \nDepartment is committed to recovering abducted children and will \ncontinue to seek the return of abducted children such as Heidi.\n  Over the past several years, I have also met with multiple members of \nthe administration, submitted written questions to nominees to the \npositions in the administration who have jurisdiction over these \nmatters.\n  In 2002, in 2003, Assistant Secretary of State for Consular Affairs \nMaura Harty stated in meetings with me, in public testimony, in \nresponse to my written questions, that the return of abducted children \nis a priority and it is the State Department's goal and our Government \nwill continue to press to recover abducted children.\n  In November of 2003, now United States Ambassador to Saudi Arabia \nJames Oberwetter stated in response to my written questions that the \nrelease of Americans who have been abducted to Saudi Arabia is a \npriority and that he will raise the case of Heidi Al-Omary at the \nearliest opportunity. That was 2003.\n  In January of 2005, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice stated in \nwritten responses to my written questions that she would raise the case \nof Heidi Al-Omary at the earliest opportunity and that the return of \nabducted children is truly a priority.\n  In April of 2005, USTR nominee Robert Portman made a commitment to me \nat his confirmation hearing this month and in written responses to my \nwritten questions to work with me in collaboration with the State \nDepartment to address this issue.\n  It sounds like more plane tickets. It sounds like just more dates and \nmore plans for visitation, eliminating that mother's opportunity to \nshare the kind of time with her child that each one of us has enjoyed.\n  Finally, last week, I wrote President Bush prior to his meeting on \nMonday with Crown Prince Abdullah in Crawford, TX, asking him to raise \nthis issue. I do not know who else to write in the administration. I do \nnot know who else to appeal to. I do not know who else to sit around \nwaiting for an answer from on an issue that could not be more \nimportant, our children--not just my children, not just your children, \nMr. President, not just the children of other Senators, but children of \nthis Nation.\n  I continue to be in contact with the White House, and I welcome the \nopportunity to work with them in resolving this matter. But as my \ncolleague from Delaware came to the floor, and having asked for the \nlast 2 or 3 years for a working relationship that might bring about \nresults, I come to the floor tonight with a heavy heart, disappointed \nin the response I have gotten over the last 3 years but hopeful, \nbecause a mother's heart is always hopeful, just as the mother of that \nchild's heart is hopeful every time I talk to her. Every time I talk to \nher, she never gives up.\n  I know officers at the State Department who have responsibility for \nabduction and wrongful retention cases work hard. I know they do. I \nknow they care about the children involved. I am not doubting that. I \nam not frustrated with them because I know their hands are tied. They \ntake their instructions from higher up. And higher up does not seem to \nfeel like this is a priority. But I am speaking out to express my \nprofound frustration with the lack of results in this case and our \nGovernment's apparent policy of not rocking the boat when difficult-to-\nsolve cases like Heidi's linger in limbo indefinitely. I know our \nGovernment has said repeatedly that the return of abducted children is \na priority, but it is just not a big enough priority. I do not think we \nhave done everything we can in this case, which brings me back to the \nnomination now pending before the Senate.\n  When countries such as Saudi Arabia ask our Government to grant \nfavored trading status, I think it is only appropriate to step back and \nconsider all facets of our relationship and foreign policy goals before \nwe hand them the cookie jar.\n  I have already discussed in some detail the letter I wrote to \nAmbassador Zoellick in May of last year. Since that time, in September \nof 2004, I think it is important to note that the Secretary of State \nhas designated Saudi Arabia as a country of particular concern in the \nState Department's annual International Religious Freedom Report. So \naccording to the administration, Saudi Arabia's record in this area is \ngetting worse, not better. This status is reserved for a handful of \ngovernments that have ``engaged in or tolerate particularly severe \nviolations of religious freedom.'' Respect, Mr. President, respect for \nour faith and for other faiths--just as we try desperately in our \ncountry to respect those.\n  According to the State Department's report on Saudi Arabia:\n\n       Freedom of religion does not exist. Citizens are denied the \n     freedom to choose or change their religion, and noncitizens \n     practice their beliefs under severe restrictions.\n\n  Further, the report states that Saudi custom officials routinely open \nmail and shipments to search for contraband, which includes the Bible.\n  As my colleagues may also be aware, under this designation, the \nPresident is supposed to choose from a menu of sanctions stipulated by \nCongress, which raises questions in my mind about why we should be \nsanctioning\n\n[[Page S4532]]\n\nSaudi Arabia on one hand while trying to reward them with a trade deal \non the other without evidence of meaningful improvement.\n  When I inquired this week about the status of sanctions on Saudi \nArabia under this law, I was told that even though the deadline \nestablished in the statute to make a decision passed on March 15, no \ndecision from this administration has been announced.\n  I truly regret that Congress does not have the opportunity under \ncurrent law to vote on a bilateral trade agreement relating to Saudi \nArabia's accession to the WTO. I think that could make a real \ndifference with a country such as Saudi Arabia, and it would \nsignificantly enhance our Nation's ability to make meaningful progress \non many of our foreign policy goals.\n  To put this into a little different context, I point out what I see \nas a direct contradiction in our trade policy specific to congressional \nreview of certain countries. I will use the country of Ukraine as a \ngood example. Many of you remember the moving address before a joint \nsession of Congress by the brave new President of the Ukraine just a \nfew weeks ago. We heard him. In his address, he asked, pleaded that \nCongress graduate his country from what is known as Jackson-Vanik--a \nprocedural step taken by Congress before any former Communist country \nreceives the most favored trading relationship with the United States; \na procedural step that is proving to at least get the attention of the \nVietnamese Government, that is working desperately within the next \nyear, hopefully; a procedural step that Saudi Arabia does not have to \novercome; a procedural step unavailable to Members of Congress to have \ntheir legitimate concerns addressed.\n\n  We will not have a vote when it comes to their being rewarded with \nmembership to the WTO. And sadly, the only votes we really have much of \nany say over are these nominations, when we put holds on the names of \nvery capable individuals who want to serve this country. But without \nthat vote, our concerns will be left to Congressman Portman and the \nadministration to raise. So that is why I am here in the dead of the \nnight, to put into the Record and, hopefully, into the hearts and minds \nof the few people who are left listening that these nominations are \nimportant, and we do believe in these individuals to have great \ncapabilities, but oftentimes they are not allowed the authority to \nexercise that.\n  Given all these issues I have highlighted--the Arab boycott of \nIsrael; terrorism financing, which is costing us more and more in Iraq; \nthe lack of religious freedom; and the lack of respect Saudi Arabia has \nshown for our laws and its citizens--for the life of me, I cannot \nunderstand why we are in such a hurry to walk down the aisle on this \ntrade agreement. What is going on?\n  Most of the Members of this body know me pretty well. I am not trying \nto be ugly. But I think someone must stand up and tell the truth. Our \npolicy with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is go along to get along, even \nwhen the rights of American citizens and fundamental principles such as \nequality and freedom that define what is good about our Nation are \nsacrificed.\n  As a proud mother of twin boys, I try hard to make sure they \nunderstand that actions in life are based on priorities. They are based \non choices that each of us has to make. But without a doubt, the \nchoices we make and the actions we take have real and substantive \nconsequences and can have ramifications far beyond a single issue or \nevent. I try so hard to teach them that friendships are based on mutual \ntrust and respect.\n  To all of those nations across this globe, who are our neighbors, we \nwant desperately to build on our friendships. But if those friendships \nare to be long lasting and to be worthwhile, they must absolutely be \nbuilt on respect.\n  I do not advocate severing our relationship with Saudi Arabia. \nNeighbors and friends are important to have. Whether you grew up in \nrural America, as I did, and depend on them to help you bring your \ncrops in or to raise your children or to just get you through the \nmonth, it is important to be a good neighbor, and it is important to \nhave good neighbors. But it is hard to have that relationship if you \ndon't ask of them the kind of respect that allows you to depend on one \nanother.\n\n  As I said, I don't advocate in severing our relationship with Saudi \nArabia. I hope we can reach out. But until this administration takes \nthose steps, starts to answer our letters and our phone calls, and \nmakes a few attempts in reaching out to Saudi Arabia, the leaders of \nthat nation, to express to them how important our children are to us, \nwe have a problem. I do believe we need to step back and fully consider \nthe values we cherish as Americans as we move forward into the future. \nThis is a very real place where it has to begin.\n  I appreciate the patience of the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there other Senators seeking to yield \ntime? Does the Senator from Arkansas yield back the remainder of her \ntime under the previous order?\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \nnomination of Robert Portman to be our next United States Trade \nRepresentative.\n  Congress first mandated the appointment of a special representative \nfor trade negotiation in 1962. Since that time, our trade \nrepresentative has played a vital role in shaping much of our \ninternational economic policy. Today, it remains an important position \nthat requires a unique blend of technical and political skills for \nsuccess.\n  In that regard, we are fortunate to have Rob Portman as the \nPresident's nominee. Congressman Portman has a strong commitment to \npublic service, having served the people of Ohio in the House of \nRepresentatives for the past 12 years. His thoughtful consideration of \ncomplex issues and his determination to achieve sound public policy \nhave made him an effective leader. He has played major roles in \npension, tax, and IRS reform. He is well known for his leadership in \nthe fight against drug abuse. And, as a member of the Ways and Means \nSubcommittee on Trade, Congressman Portman has been intimately involved \nin a number of key international trade policy initiatives.\n  There is strong support for the nominee among the business and \nagriculture communities. In an open letter sent to Congress on April \n18, literally hundreds of companies, associations and Chambers of \nCommerce expressed their desire to see Congressman Portman confirmed as \nthe next United States Trade Representative, noting that he ``is the \nright person for the job. During his six terms in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives, he has distinguished himself as a thoughtful and \nrespected leader on international trade and investment issues. \nMoreover, he has demonstrated a spirit of cooperation that will be \nessential in the months ahead as Congress considers many trade issues \non its agenda.\n  Similar sentiments are expressed by over 60 representatives of the \nagriculture sector. In a letter dated April 19 they note that \n``Representative Portman has long championed bipartisan solutions to \ntrade'' adding that he ``will bring tremendous talent and experience to \nthis important post. We applaud Representative Portman's deep \ncommitment to enforcing trade agreements and believe his desire to \nachieve meaningful results for American agriculture and agribusiness is \nprecisely the leadership that is needed in the dynamic and sometimes \ndifficult to navigate world of agriculture trade.''\n  There is strong interest in moving this nomination quickly. There are \na number of important events coming up over the next few weeks \nincluding a meeting of the World Trade Organization ministers in early \nMay. So, I hope we will be able to confirm this nominee quickly.\n  There is a long tradition of legislative and executive branch \ncooperation on international economic policy. The importance of working \ntogether became most evident following the passage of the Smoot-Hawley \nTariff Act of 1930 which helped plunge our economy into the Great \nDepression. In 1934 President Roosevelt recognized that high tariff \nbarriers were strangling our economy. To spur economic growth, he \nsought and received legislative authority to negotiate reductions in \ntariff barriers.\n  That bill, the Trade Agreements Act, embodied the basic partnership \nbetween the legislative and executive branches of Government that we \nknow today as Trade Promotion Authority.\n\n[[Page S4533]]\n\nIt is a partnership that has served this Nation well for the better \npart of the last century, and hopefully will continue to do so for the \nnext.\n  But the battle for economic freedom is far from over. We cannot \nafford to return to the tyranny of tariffs embodied by Smoot-Hawley. \nDecisions we make in the near future on economic policy will have a \nsignificant impact on generations to come. They are decisions we cannot \ntake lightly. Strong leadership at the Office of the United States \nTrade Representative is key. Congress will soon be considering free \ntrade agreements with Central America, the Dominican Republic and \nBahrain.\n  We also have a number of important bilateral and regional \nnegotiations underway that will bring significant benefits to the U.S. \neconomy. And, perhaps most important, are on-going negotiations at the \nWorld Trade Organization. Successfully concluding these negotiations \nand ensuring their implementation will take a skilled champion of \nAmerica's interests. I am confident that Rob Portman will effectively \nfill that role.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in strongly supporting Congressman \nPortman to be our next United States Trade Representative.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na letter dated April 28, 2005.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                         Committee on Finance,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 28, 2005.\n     Hon. Evan Bayh,\n     U.S. Senator,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bayh: As you know, the Senate Finance \n     Committee will be holding a hearing on U.S.-China trade \n     relations before July 15th. As a co-sponsor of legislation to \n     apply countervailing duty laws to non-market economies such \n     as China you will be invited to testify at this hearing. I \n     share your concern about China's use of subsidies and their \n     potential impact on manufacturing and other workers in our \n     economy. The hearing will be an important opportunity to \n     fully air this issue and analyze the best possible policy \n     solutions to the problem including statutory application of \n     countervailing duty laws to non-market economies as proposed \n     by S. 593, the ``Stopping Overseas Subsidies'' Act.\n       Since we will have a full discussion of the many pressing \n     issues surrounding U.S.-China trade relations prior to July \n     15th, I appreciate the fact that you agree it will not be \n     necessary to offer an amendment or to seek a stand alone vote \n     on this issue prior to review by the Senate Finance Committee \n     at this hearing.\n       I appreciate your interest in this issue and look forward \n     to continuing our discussion on this important and timely \n     topic.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Charles E. Grassley,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to support \nthe nomination of Rob Portman to fill the post of U.S. Trade \nRepresentative. I have been privileged to work with Rob for over 10 \nyears.\n  As my colleagues know, Rob represents the Cincinnati district which \nis just over the river from my home in northern Kentucky. Over the \nyears, Rob and I have developed a strong professional relationship as \nwe worked together on issues important to the northern Kentucky-Greater \nCincinnati region and the Nation.\n  But just as importantly, I am honored to be able to call Rob Portman \nmy good friend. My wife Mary and I have come to know Rob, his wife \nJane, and their children quite well over the years and we admire and \nrespect them.\n  So I come to you as someone who knows Rob Portman as well as any \nother Member of Congress to tell you that President Bush could not have \npicked a better man for this job. Rob is one of the smartest guys in \nWashington and he combines that intelligence with sound judgment and a \nstrong moral compass.\n  We are all aware of Rob's ability to work in a bipartisan manner to \naccomplish legislative goals. I am confident Rob will bring this \nability to build bridges to his job as the U.S. Trade Representative--a \njob where bridge building is integral to success.\n  I can't think of anyone that I would rather have representing our \ncountry to the world, and I urge my colleagues to act favorably and \nquickly on his nomination.\n\n\n                      Nomination of Robert Portman\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am delighted to take this opportunity to \nreaffirm my support for Representative Portman's nomination to become \nthe United States Trade Representative. Throughout his professional \ncareer, his work his exhibited one common characteristic: excellence.\n  From his time working as a young lawyer at a prestigious Washington, \nDC, law firm to his current responsibilities as a member of the House \nWays and Means Subcommittee on Trade, Representative Portman has done \nmuch to make a difference in peoples' lives, in no small part by \nsupporting legislation designed to open markets and strengthen trade \nrelationships. He believes that if we are to create a truly stable and \nprosperous world and strengthen our own Nation's economic position, our \ntrade policy must be based on free trade agreements that open markets \nto American goods and products.\n  Representative Portman also shares my belief that it as important to \nenforce free trade agreements as it is to create new agreements. \nWithout vigilant enforcement of these agreements there remains a \npossibility of creating a disadvantageous environment for our exports. \nThis is especially true in one of our most important areas, \nintellectual property. Representative Portman and I have discussed this \nissue, but I wanted to reiterate its importance by stating publicly how \nconcerned I am about the recent reports that I have heard regarding the \nincrease in intellectual piracy in nations such as Russia and China.\n  Representative Portman will face many challenges in his new \nassignment as United States Trade Representative. One of the most \nimmediate will be the Dominican Republic--Central American Free Trade \nAgreement. As many others, I have concerns about what this agreement \nwill mean for U.S. jobs and how effectively the U.S. can compete in \nthis global marketplace. However, after diligently studying the \nagreement, I have come to the conclusion that U.S. companies and \nconsumers, including Utahns, will benefit exponentially from this \nagreement with increased exports to our regional trading partners and \nlower domestic prices for many goods and services.\n  As Congressman Portman has pointed out to many of us and as Acting \nRepresentative Allgeier discussed during his testimony before the \nSenate Finance Committee 2 weeks ago, there are a number of advantages \nfor the United States to ratify this agreement. Particularly \ninteresting is that it would reverse the United States' policy of \nunilaterally affording preferences to Central American goods under the \nCaribbean Basin Initiative and the Generalized System of Preferences. \nThat means that where once U.S. goods faced trade hurdles, barriers \nwould be eliminated.\n  Utah exported over $6 million worth of information technology \nproducts to CAFTA nations last year. This treaty will eliminate key \ndistribution barriers in those countries, opening markets to Utah \ncompanies in the telecommunications and e-commerce arenas. Utah's \nfarmers will also enjoy access to new markets as CAFTA will immediately \neliminate tariffs on wheat, barley, oats and rye. However, despite \nthese advantages we must remain on guard that this agreement and \nprevious agreements are adequately enforced to ensure that American \nproducts are fairly treated in these markets.\n  This is only the ``tip of the iceberg'' of the challenges that \nRepresentative Portman will face. I do not believe that the President \ncould have chosen a better person to create and enforce the \nextraordinary opportunities afforded by new and existing free trade \nagreements. Representative Portman's nomination has my full support and \nconfidence.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Robert J. Portman, of Ohio, to be United \nStates Trade Representative, with the rank of Ambassador Extraordinary \nand Plenipotentiary.\n  The nomination was confirmed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The President will be immediately notified of \nthe Senate's action.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/28/senate-section/article/S4533-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4533-S4534]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, Benjamin Franklin once said: He that would \nfish must venture his bait.\n  In America, we have millions of creative women and men and even teens \nwho cast their reels every day in the hopes of catching the American \ndream. And fortunately we have the most vibrant economy in the world \nand the Small Business Administration to help them.\n  This week the Small Business Administration is hosting its annual \ncelebration of America's entrepreneurs at the Washington Hilton. \nPresident Bush spoke to the group several days ago in recognition of \ntheir tremendous contributions. One of the topics that had been \ndiscussed over the course of the week is just how important are small \nbusiness owners. These innovators create 60 to 80 percent of new jobs \nnationwide. They generate more than 50 percent of the gross domestic \nproduct. Small business owners are the heart of the American \nmarketplace, and their contributions to jobs and productivity are its \nlifeblood.\n  In my home State of Tennessee, over 97 percent of all businesses are \nsmall businesses. Women-owned businesses generate billions of dollars \nin revenue and employ tens of thousands of workers. Minority-owned \nfirms, the fastest growing small business sector in America, account \nfor nearly 33,000 small businesses in Tennessee. Elisa Comer, CEO of \nEagle's Landing Transcription Service over in Johnson City, TN, has \nbeen chosen this year as one of the Small Business Administration's 50 \nsmall business people of the year. Elisa's company offers cutting edge \nelectronic technology that improves medical recordkeeping.\n  This happens to be an issue that in my capacity as a Senator I have \nworked on very closely. Companies that provide up-to-the-minute medical \nrecords technology are crucial to improving patient care, to improving \npatient safety, and improving efficiency in the medical field. Workers \nand consumers depend on entrepreneurs such as Elisa to generate jobs \nand to provide higher quality products and services. And with the help \nof the Small Business Administration, America's entrepreneurs can get \ntheir ideas off the ground and into the neighborhood near you.\n  Take, for example, the restaurant chain Outback Steakhouse. It may \ncome as a surprise to some, but Outback Steakhouse is not headquartered \nin Australia. It is headquartered right here in America, down in Tampa, \nFL. In a little over a decade, Outback Steakhouse has grown from a \nsmall restaurant operation into a nationwide phenomenon. In February of \n1990, the 2\\1/2\\-year-old company employed approximately 300 people and \nhad a net worth of less than $2 million. That year it received a boost \nfrom the Small Business Administration. Ten years later, the restaurant \nchain employs more than 38,000 people and in 1999 posted revenues of a \ndizzying $1.6 billion. Outback has restaurants in 48 States and 13 \ncountries as far away as Seoul and Rio de Janeiro.\n  Another dazzling example of the Small Business Administration's \ncatalytic effect is Staples. It started as a single office supply store \nin Brighton, MA, in 1986. The office supply store is now the country's \nlargest operator of office superstores. Staples employs 58,000 people \nand has annual gross sales of $11.6 billion. It even offers products \nand services to up-and-coming small businesses to help them cut costs.\n  The Small Business Administration has helped more than 22 million \nAmericans start, grow, and expand their businesses. It has become the \nGovernment's most effective instrument for economic development. With \nits help, small companies have grown from a handful of employees into \nthousands.\n  The SBA is just one part of our efforts to support job-creating \npolicies. In 2003, the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Act we passed \nprovided more than 25 million small business owners with tax relief \ntotaling $75 billion. In fact, small businesses received 80 percent of \nthe benefits of the reduction of the top marginal tax rate. The tax \nrelief package quadrupled the amount small businesses can expense for \nnew capital investments, which will lead, and has led, to new \ninvestment in technology and machinery and other equipment. It phases \nout the Federal death tax, ensuring that family business owners are \nable to leave their businesses to their families or key employees.\n  These policies are helping to create new jobs and increase \nproductivity and make every consumer's dollar go farther. Remington's \nelectric shaver magnate Victor Kiam once observed:\n\n       Entrepreneurs are simply those who understand there is \n     little difference between obstacle and opportunity and are \n     able to turn both to their advantage.\n\n  I commend my fellow citizens who possess this talent to turn \nobstacles into opportunity, not only to their advantage, but also to \nthe advantage of us all. Their risk-taking and creativity help keep \nAmerica moving forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/28/senate-section/article/S4534-2", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4534-S4535]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             THE PAST MONTH\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, there are a few comments I will now make on \nthe past month. Indeed, it has been a productive month in the Senate \nand I do want to thank all of my colleagues for their hard work and \ndiligence over the course of the last several weeks. It has been an \nalmost unbelievably eventful time on the world stage, first and \nforemost with the passing of Pope John Paul II. None of us will ever \nforget hearing the news of his death and feeling that we were in some \nway fortunate to be witnesses to a moment and to an era that will \nchange and instruct history for generations. Nor will we ever forget \nour pilgrimage to the Vatican to pay our respects to the Pope and his \nextraordinary life. Millions of Catholics and non-Catholics alike were \ntouched by this great man. He influenced more lives than kings and \nPresidents before him.\n  I believe I speak for all in welcoming his successor, Pope Benedict \nXVI, the new leader of the Catholic Church. He is a man of great \ncompassion and integrity, and I believe that, like John Paul before \nhim, Pope Benedict will spread God's message of peace and be an \ninspiration to millions.\n  We also witnessed on the world stage the historic withdrawal of \nSyrian troops from Lebanon. Next week, I will be traveling there to see \nfirsthand the changes that are being brought. Democracy is on the \nmarch. We are witnessing history in the making. After some months of \ndifficult negotiation, the Iraqis have formed a new transitional \ngovernment from the fruits of their first true elections. This is \ntremendous news. Prime Minister al-Jaafari deserves great credit for \nincluding a cabinet consisting of the great diversity of Iraq's \npopulation.\n  The Iraqis are a brave and determined people. January 30 proved that \ntruism vividly and beyond a doubt. My heart goes out to the Iraqi \npeople as they give shape to that first true democracy in the heart of \nArab Middle East. They are an inspiration to their brethren and to all \nof us who strive for freedom. These are perilous times, but they are \nhopeful times. The United States can stand proudly before the world for \nour efforts to spread freedom, our ideals, our principles, our efforts, \nand our blood to free millions of people the world over. And this body, \nthe Senate, has been instrumental in advancing America's interests in a \nmyriad of ways, concrete and symbolic, empowering and inspiring.\n  This week, after 2 weeks of debate, we passed legislation to fund our \nmen and women in uniform who are fighting for freedom, and to fund our \nhumanitarian outreach to the December tsunami victims. We will continue \nto supply all necessary resources to keep our military strong.\n  During this session, we also confirmed Ambassador John Negroponte as \nDirector of National Intelligence. Mr. Negroponte will be responsible \nfor overseeing the entire intelligence community. It will be his job to \nkeep America safe by bridging the gap between our 15 intelligence \nagencies and improving information sharing between agencies. I am \nconfident that, as our new Director of Intelligence, Mr.\n\n[[Page S4535]]\n\nNegroponte will work hard to make the reforms necessary to help keep \nAmerica safe.\n  Tonight, we have approved the final two members of the President's \nCabinet, Robert Portman to be USTR and Steve Johnson to the EPA. The \nPresident's Cabinet, as of a few minutes ago, is now complete.\n  Of course, tonight we had the budget. I congratulate Chairman Judd \nGregg. This, as I mentioned earlier this evening, is the fifth quickest \nconference report on the budget in history. The budget addresses \nspending head on. It is a strict budget from a fiscal standpoint. It \naddresses the short-term deficit by holding down discretionary \nspending, cutting the deficit in half in about 4 years. It addresses \nthe outyear deficits driven by entitlements. It reinstitutes the \nenforcement mechanism that will discipline spending. It is a fully \ntransparent budget that accounts for the true war costs over the next \nyear.\n  I look forward to returning to our work when we return from the \nrecess. I am confident that with bipartisan determination we will get \nfurther work done. It has been an eventful month--a month of global and \nhistory-changing events. I am proud that under the leadership of \nPresident Bush, America has been at the forefront of freedom.\n  Over the recess, I will have the opportunity to travel to the Middle \nEast to witness many events and learn firsthand the challenges facing \nthe region--more specifically, the progress of the Israeli and \nPalestinian peace process. We will meet with key Israeli leaders in \nIsrael and travel to Ramallah in the West Bank to meet with President \nAbbas and members of his Government.\n  We will also meet and listen to other voices in order to hear a wide \nrange of views. Our goal is to listen and explore how we can help move \nthe process forward and advance the cause of democracy.\n  We will also be visiting Jordan and Egypt, two important players in \nthe Middle East peace process. They have endorsed the roadmap to peace \nand have shown by example that Arab peoples can live side by side with \nIsraelis. They are also close friends of the U.S. and are allies of the \nglobal war on terrorism. Both countries are also pursuing much needed \nreforms. More needs to be done, not just because it is in our national \nsecurity interest, but because it is in their people's interest. \nTransparency, continued movement toward democracy, economic freedom, \nand prosperity should be the goals of all governments in the region.\n  In all of these stops, we will meet with real, everyday people and \nsee these cities and countries in action, whether it be visiting \nhospitals in Jerusalem or shopowners and business people in the West \nBank.\n  Finally, we will also travel to Beirut to meet with key opposition \nleaders and current government leaders. Our goal is to underscore our \nunwavering position that all Syrian intelligence and military personnel \nmust leave Lebanon. Elections must be held on time and the Lebanese \npeople must determine their own future through free and fair elections. \nThe United States stands firmly behind the Lebanese people.\n  In closing, I wish my colleagues a safe and productive recess and \nlook forward to resuming our work when we return.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/28/senate-section/article/S4535-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4535-S4536]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              MOTHER'S DAY\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, Washington, like most of the Nation, is \nawash in green. Lawns are lush and verdant. The new leaves on the trees \nare bright green, soft, and whole--not yet the tough, sun- and insect-\nscarred veterans of late summer, but as delicate as a baby's skin. The \ndogwoods and lilacs are blooming, and the azaleas are putting on their \nmagnificent show. In a few days, it will be May. May is a beautiful \nmonth in the Nation's capital, just as it is in the hills of West \nVirginia. It is, perhaps, the most beautiful month. It is a gentle, \nnurturing month, full of tenderness and promise.\n  It is fitting that such a month be graced with a day to honor \nmothers. Sunday, May 8th, is Mother's Day. On this day, tender thoughts \nof affection and gentle acts of kindness and appreciation are showered \nupon our mothers, who have sustained us all with their gentle hands, \nwarm hearts, and forgiving natures.\n  To be sure, women have as many facets as a brilliantly cut diamond. \nThey can be tough and demanding professionals, fierce competitors in \nany field of endeavor, stoic and enduring in the face of great \nhardship, and outstanding performers in the arts, medicine and science. \nThe news as well as history is full of stories of the accomplishments \nof women. But on this one day, we celebrate the side of women that is \nmost like this lovely month of May--the mothering side. It is the side \nthat kissed our baby feet, that saved locks of hair from our first \nhaircuts and our first baby teeth. It is the side whose tender touch \nsoothed our hurts, whose unwavering belief in our talents sustained us \nthrough sports failures, painful piano recitals, and countless hours \nof practices and tantrums. It is the side that sang to us, baked us \ncookies, and patiently helped build our science project volcanoes out \nof soda bottles and plaster of Paris. It is the side that glowed as we \nreceived our diplomas, went out on our first dates, accepted our first \njobs; the side that held us as we lost jobs, lost loved ones, lost \nfaith in our dreams. Our mothers never lose faith. In business or at \nwork, women might be efficient, even ruthless, judges, quickly \nassessing and sorting through problems, but at home, as mothers, we \ndepend on their faith and support to find solutions for our problems.\n\n  Next weekend, mothers will be feted with cards, flowers, and Sunday \nbrunches. They will begin to get some of the backlog of hugs that are \ntheir due, a down payment on the debt of gratitude we owe them for \ntaking on such a monumental task. The only instruction that women \nreceive on how to be a good mother comes from their own mother. It is a \nremarkable achievement that so many women learn this complex job so \neffortlessly, and manage to perform it so well. Women from around the \nglobe, women who will never break a world record, invent a new \ntechnology, discover a new fact, will share with those record breakers \nin the phenomenally important job of motherhood. Society utterly \ndepends on how well mothers and fathers manage the task of parenting. \nIt is a heavy responsibility to lay upon such rank amateurs.\n  I can well recall the early days of my own marriage. I have been \nblessed to have been married to the same kind and forgiving woman for \nalmost 68 years. We are now proud great grandparents. But nearly seven \ndecades ago, we were the rankest of amateurs at marriage and \nparenthood. Erma has always been my touchstone. Her faith in me has \nnever wavered, and she took to mothering me as effortlessly as she took \nto mothering our daughters. In Erma Ora James Byrd runs the blood of a \ngreat line of mothers--fierce in their devotion to their families, \nvigilant in their care, loving in their manner.\n\n  That same fierceness, vigilance, and devotion can be seen in women \nwho bring their mothering skills to the office as well. I am so often \nimpressed at the energy and ability of working mothers. Their ability \nto focus on their two big jobs--work and family--takes real dedication, \nprecise time management, and grueling endurance. Single mothers require \nthose qualities in even greater measure. They often do not have someone \nwho can help with the homework, share in the driving to school and \npractices, take turns staying home with sick children, put the children \nto bed or read them stories, or do any of the so-called ``father's \njobs'' of taking out the trash, mowing the lawn, fixing the car, or \neven drying the dishes. It takes superhuman strength to keep up that \nlevel of effort at home while still earning a living. I do not think \nthat, as a society, we have made it easy for mothers, and especially \nfor single mothers, to do their twin jobs. We need to find better ways \nto help women balance work and motherhood. We need their skills and \ntalents in the workforce, but we also need their skills and talent at \nhome, building our Nation's future.\n  I know of some women, in West Virginia and throughout the country, \nwho have found themselves in the single mother category after the \ntragic loss of their husbands in battles in Afghanistan and Iraq. They \nhave had to deal with their own and their children's grief, the loss of \ntheir husband's income, and making a new home for\n\n[[Page S4536]]\n\nthemselves outside of the military, plus the sudden loss of their \npartner in childrearing. They and their children should not be \nforgotten after the furled flag is handed to them at a military \nfuneral. We deservedly call their husbands heroes for the sacrifice \nthey made for our Nation, but their families are left to be heroes each \nand every lonely day thereafter. They need and merit the support and \ncomfort from all of us, on Mother's Day and every day.\n\n  Children are sometimes, and rightly, referred to as our greatest \nnational treasure. They are our future, the great hope for the \ncontinued success and enduring values of our Nation. But if that \nstatement is true, then it is also true that good mothers are our \nNation's greatest national resource. Without mothers dedicated every \nday to this monumental task, our future would be bleak indeed. Though \nthe Senate will not be in session next week, I am proud to call \nattention to the coming of Mother's Day. I hope that others will join \nme in applauding the noble calling of motherhood, and in recognizing \nthe hard work and love that mothers demonstrate day after day.\n  I would like to close with a poem by Strickland Gillilan, called \n``The Reading Mother,'' as it speaks to the simple, lasting gifts that \nmothers give their children.\n\n                           The Reading Mother\n\n     I had a Mother who read to me\n     Sagas of pirates who scoured the sea,\n     Cutlasses clenched in their yellow teeth,\n     ``Blackbirds'' stowed in the hold beneath.\n\n     I had a Mother who read me lays\n     Of ancient and gallant and golden days;\n     Stories of Marmion and Ivanhoe,\n     Which every boy has a right to know.\n\n     I had a Mother who read me tales\n     Of Gelert the hound from the hills of Wales,\n     True to his trust till his tragic death,\n     Faithfulness blent with his final breath.\n\n     I had a Mother who read me the things\n     That wholesome life to the boy heart brings--\n     Stories that stir with an upward touch,\n     Oh, that each mother of boys were such!\n\n     You may have tangible wealth untold;\n     Caskets of jewels and coffers of gold.\n     Richer than I you can never be--\n     I had a Mother who read to me.\n\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/28/senate-section/article/S4536-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4536]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n            MR. GEORGE FUMICH, AN OUTSTANDING WEST VIRGINIAN\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes to say goodbye \nto a remarkable friend, and an outstanding West Virginian, Mr. George \nFumich, who passed away last week.\n  George Fumich was born in Pennsylvania, but he grew up in Morgantown, \nWV, and graduated from the West Virginia School of Law. Like so many \nwho come to our State from elsewhere, he developed a passion for West \nVirginia that lasted a lifetime.\n  As an officer in the United States Army during World War II, he \nserved in the Italian campaign. His division was the first to move into \nRome and was instrumental in the liberation of that magnificent city \nfrom Nazi occupation. He was later captured by the Germans in Northern \nItaly, but Italian partisans liberated him from his Nazi captors.\n  For his distinguished military service, George Fumich was awarded two \nBronze Stars, a Silver Star, the European African Middle Eastern \nService Medal, a POW medal, and as Presidential Unit Citation.\n  After the war, Mr. Fumich became corporate counsel for the \nChristopher Coal Company, and then began a successful political career. \nHis political accomplishments included being elected to the West \nVirginia House of Delegates and serving as Senator John F. Kennedy's \ncampaign manager for northern West Virginia during the historic 1960 \nWest Virginia Democratic primary.\n  After Kennedy's election, Mr. Fumich began a successful career with \nthe Federal Government. He served as Director of the Office of Mineral \nExploration at the Department of Interior, as the first Director of the \nOffice of Coal Research at the Interior Department, and from 1975 to \n1977, he was the Director of Fossil Energy at the Energy Research and \nDevelopment Administration. In 1977, he was appointed Assistant \nSecretary for Fossil Energy at the U.S. Department of Energy.\n  After leaving the Federal Government, he was appointed Dean of the \nCollege of Mineral and Energy Resources, and then served as president \nof George Fumich Associates, an energy consulting firm.\n  His interest in coal, his love of West Virginia, and his devotion to \nWest Virginia University all merged. Over the years, it has been rare \nto attend any event at which the coal, the State, and the university \nconverge, without seeing George Fumich. He was an enthusiastic booster \nof anything he set about to promote, yet he had a gentle way about him \nthat earned the trust and respect of others.\n  I will miss seeing George making the rounds at coal events here in \nWashington. His was a remarkable career for a remarkable man. This \nkind, brave and honorable man had been a military officer, a \npolitician, a POW, a dean, an administrator, an attorney, a politician, \nand a Federal official. But above all else, he was a loving and caring \nfather and husband who will be deeply missed by his multitude of \nfriends, and his wonderful family, of which he was so proud.\n  West Virginia University alumni have lost an energetic supporter for \nall things WVU. The people of Clarksburg and Morgantown have lost a \ngood neighbor. The State of West Virginia has lost an outstanding \ncitizen. I have lost a dear friend.\n  My wife Erma and I extend our deepest heartfelt condolences to his \nwife of 46 years, Marie Fumich, and their children and grandchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/28/senate-section/article/S4536-2", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4536]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      COMMEMORATING THE 90TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to honor the memory of the victims \nof the Armenian genocide.\n  This week marks the 90th anniversary of the beginning of the genocide \nthat ultimately took the lives of one-and-a-half million Armenian men, \nwomen and children. On April 24, 1915, 200 Armenian religious, \nintellectual and political leaders in Constantinople were arrested by \nthe Government of the Ottoman Empire and murdered. It was the beginning \nof the first genocide of the 20th century, and it continued until 1923. \nIt was a vicious, organized crime against humanity that included \nmurder, deportation, torture and slave labor.\n  The Armenian genocide was followed by a concerted effort to destroy \nany record of the Armenians in Asia Minor, including the destruction of \nreligious and cultural monuments, and the changing of place names. I am \nsaddened that there are those who would prefer to forget the Armenian \ngenocide. To ignore it is to desecrate the memory of those who lost \ntheir lives. And such denial sends the message that genocide will be \ntolerated by the world.\n  To deny the genocide of the Armenians, or any atrocity of this scale, \nis to forsake the value we place on human life and the principles of \nliberty upon which this country is based. Those who turn a deaf ear to \nthe Armenian genocide, knowingly or unknowingly, abet the future of \ngenocide by failing to raise public consciousness about this tragic \nreality.\n  As we remember those whose lives were brutally taken during the \nArmenian genocide, we also pay tribute to the survivors, the living \ntestimony of this historic crime, and to their families, many of whom \nare now Armenian-Americans. We must assure them that we, as the leaders \nof the democratic world, will not forget this tragedy, but rather gain \nthe wisdom and knowledge necessary to ensure that we can prevent its \nrepetition.\n  Recognizing the Armenian genocide takes on added importance in the \nface of the genocide occurring right now in the Darfur region of Sudan. \nAs we pause to reflect upon this grievous example of man's inhumanity \nto man, let us honor the victims of the Armenian genocide and all \ncrimes against humanity by not only acknowledging their suffering, but \nby acting to halt similar atrocities that are occurring now before our \nvery eyes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/28/senate-section/article/S4536-3", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4536-S4537]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              HONORING QUINCY, IL, MAYOR CHARLES W. SCHOLZ\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to tell you \nabout a friend of mine.\n  Chuck Scholz has three great loves in this world: his family, his \nfaith and his community, Quincy, Illinois. On May 2,\n\n[[Page S4537]]\n\nafter 12 years as Quincy's mayor, Chuck Scholz is stepping down.\n  It was clear from his earliest days as mayor that Chuck Scholz was a \nleader. Days after he was sworn in, the Great Mississippi River Flood \nof 1993 deluged Quincy and many other towns up and down the \nMississippi. Even when the flood waters made the bridges connecting \nQuincy to West Quincy, MO, impassable--leaving the region isolated--\nChuck Scholz never panicked. He led a relief effort that brought \ntogether Federal, State, and local resources. After the flood waters \nreceded, he worked with communities in three States to lay the \nfoundation for cooperative economic development efforts that continue \nto this day. He turned destruction and despair into focused \ndetermination. His influence on Quincy is so positive and so pervasive \nthat today, many of us cannot think of Quincy or western Illinois \nwithout thinking of Chuck Scholz.\n  Chuck is a compassionate public servant and a talented lawyer. He is \nalso an avid Quincy historian. In 1994, he was able to relive an \nimportant chapter in Quincy's history when he welcomed President \nAbraham Lincoln to the city. Actually, it was a very convincing actor \nwho was playing Lincoln in a re-creation of the famous 1860 Lincoln-\nDouglas Presidential debates in Quincy. The debate was covered live on \nC-SPAN.\n  Mayor Scholz also welcomed a living President to Quincy. Hours after \nPresident Bill Clinton delivered his final State of the Union Address \nin 2000, Air Force One touched down at Quincy's Baldwin Field, and \nPresident Clinton delivered a speech in Washington Park. That visit and \nso many other remarkable events--would not have happened without Mayor \nScholz's leadership.\n  The Scholz administration leaves an impressive list of \naccomplishments, from lowering property taxes to improving city \nservices and enhancing public safety. Working hard and in a bipartisan \nmanner, Chuck Scholz has made the ``Gem City'' shine even brighter. \nQuincy is a more prosperous, more vibrant, more beautiful, and more \nhopeful place than when he first became mayor.\n  Chuck Scholz is proud of the sister city bonds he helped forge \nbetween Quincy and the cities of Hereford, Germany, and Jiaxing, China. \nHe has hosted Presidents, bishops, Supreme Court Justices, and \ndignitaries from many nations. But his favorite conversations have \nalways been with Quincyans. He loves chatting with local grade school \nstudents and rewarding them for good grades with one of his famous red, \nwhite, and blue bookmarks.\n  Retiring as mayor will allow Chuck to spend more time with his wife \nBecky and his sons Charles and Jake. He will rediscover the law and \nmaybe even spend a bit more time on the golf course or conducting the \nQuincy Park Band. But I know his service to his hometown will never \nstop.\n  As Chuck Scholz prepares to begin this next chapter in his life, I \nwish him well and I join many others in thanking him for 12 years of \nremarkable service to his community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/28/senate-section/article/S4537-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4537]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                          Sergeant Rocky Payne\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, it is with heavy heart that I rise today to \nhonor the life of SGT Rocky Payne, a soldier in the Army's 497th \nTransportation Group, who bravely gave his life in service to his \ncountry. Sergeant Rocky Payne, a native of Howell, UT, was killed on \nMarch 16, 2005, in an explosion created by a roadside bomb in the city \nof Baghdad. Sergeant Payne is a true hero who died defending his Nation \nand bringing freedom to an oppressed people.\n  Sergeant Payne's dream of being a soldier was fulfilled when he \njoined the Marines at the age of 20, serving 4 years. Shortly after the \nend of his enlistment with the Marines he joined the Army and was again \nsent to Iraq, this time as a gunner protecting the supply convoys that \nmake our operations in Iraq possible. In honor of his dedication and \nservice he was posthumously advanced to the rank of sergeant.\n  I have been told that as a young man SGT Payne exhibited an unusual \nability to work with his hands. Old bicycles and electronics found new \nlife under his determined resourcefulness. He restored an old rusty \ntruck which hadn't run in years to working condition in only 2 days. \nPossessing the ability to play piano by ear, SGT Payne apparently could \nreconstruct a tune he had heard only once and play it on the piano. But \nit was when his hands were placed in the service of others that they \ndid the most good. ``He was a good, good person,'' his brother is \nreported as saying. ``One of the kindest people you would ever come \nacross.'' As a soldier SGT Payne fought bravely to ensure that the \npeople of Iraq would one day enjoy freedom from oppression. ``He loved \nserving,'' said his father in one newspaper story. ``He honestly felt \nlike he was helping the Iraqi people.''\n  Sergeant Payne served his country with courage and honor and his loss \nis one that our entire country will share forever.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/28/senate-section/article/S4537-2", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4537-S4538]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                FREEDOM\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this past weekend millions of Jews \naround the world celebrated the beginning of the Passover holiday. \nGathered at Seder tables with family and friends, they commemorated the \nIsraelites' exodus from Egypt almost 4,000 years ago.\n  Jewish law dictates, however, that the Jewish people must do more on \nPassover than merely remember their ancestors' time in bondage. They \nmust strive to reenact the experience.\n  Using matzah and bitter herbs, the Seder is an endeavor to recreate \nthe past. To literally taste the bitterness of slavery and the \nsweetness of freedom.\n  It is also an opportunity to sharpen awareness of an alarming yet \noft-overlooked truth: that millions of men, women and children around \nthe world are still enslaved and have yet to know freedom.\n  Ultimately the Passover Seder is a modern call to action. It reminds \nthat until all people know the joy of freedom, none of us is truly \nfree.\n  Many Jews use the Seder not only to celebrate the value of freedom, \nbut to call attention to regions of the world where the spirit of \nslavery lives on in places like Darfur, Sudan.\n  For over 2 years now, the Darfur people have been terrorized by \nviolence. Millions have been oppressed by threats of death and \ndestruction. Meanwhile, untold numbers of refugees have fled across the \nscorched earth, seeking refuge from their taskmasters.\n  The genocide that rages on in Darfur is a modern derivative of \nslavery. With the support of the Khartoum Government, Janjaweed militia \ngroups commit mass looting, raping and violence inspired by ethnic \nhatred.\n  A recent analysis by the coalition for International Justice \nindicates that nearly 400,000 civilians have died since the conflict \nbegan 2 years ago. Over 140,000 have been killed by Sudanese Government \nforces. And an estimated 250,000 Darfur civilians have perished from \ndisease and starvation stemming from displacement.\n  Recently, there has also been a disturbing trend of intimidation \ndirected at aid workers in the region. The Red Cross reports that \nattacks on aid convoys in Darfur have increased in recent weeks. And \nlast month, a USAID worker was intentionally shot point blank in an \nattempt to thwart humanitarian efforts and spread fear and \nintimidation.\n  Having personally visited the refugee camps on the Chad-Sudan border \nand met with survivors, I know that millions of our brothers and \nsisters are still crushed under the yoke of slavery and fear. Millions \nof them still do not know what it means to be free.\n  Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel recently commented that ``All are entitled \nto live with dignity and hope. All are entitled to live without fear \nand pain. Not to assist Sudan's victims today would for me be unworthy \nof what I have learned from my teachers, my ancestors and my friends, \nnamely that God alone is alone: His creatures must not be.''\n  We must reject this form of slavery by oppression. We must stop the \nkillings. The death toll will only rise without immediate, convincing \nand unified intervention by the international community.\n  It is our obligation as free people to bring hope and banish \nrepression.\n  And it is my belief that we should use the message shared by the \nPassover\n\n[[Page S4538]]\n\nstory, and, indeed, the wisdom of all traditions, to guide us wisely on \nour Journey.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/28/senate-section/article/S4538-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4538]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          RUSSIA'S G-8 PROBLEM\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this summer Russia will assume the \nrotating leadership position of the Group of Eight nations for the \nfirst time. I have expressed my concern repeatedly about the democratic \ndeterioration in Russia and I believe that, unless the Russian \nleadership makes significant democratic progress, its continued \nmembership in the G-8 should be blocked. Since Senator Lieberman and I \nfirst expressed this view in a resolution we submitted in 2003, I have \nheard similar sentiments from Senate colleagues and individuals outside \nthe Congress. Many observers across the political and ideological \nspectrum are concerned by Russia's retreat from core democratic \nprinciples.\n  President Vladimir Putin recently delivered an address aimed at \nreassuring the world that he takes democracy seriously. And while a \nnumber of the passages were welcome, others displayed a view of history \nand of Russia's role in the world that is simply astonishing. I would \nlike to share with my colleagues today's Washington Post editorial that \nmakes this point in detail.\n  Moscow's commitment to democracy and the rule of law is a vital \nelement of America's relationship with Russia, and with Russia's ties \nto various multilateral institutions. I hope that the Russian \nleadership might see that its national interests lie in cooperation, \nnot competition, with democratic countries. I also hope that Russia \nwill change many elements of its policy toward smaller neighbors. \nRussia has based Russian troops in Georgia and Moldova without the \nconsent of those countries, thereby undermining their sovereignty and \nviolating international law.\n  If the Kremlin persists in persecuting Mr. Putin's political rivals, \ncracking down on the free media, and intimidating countries along \nRussian borders, I believe that Russian chairmanship of the G-8 is \nentirely inappropriate. Again, I recommend to my colleagues the \nWashington Post editorial I submit for the Record.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the editorial be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Apr. 27, 2005]\n\n                          Mr. Putin's Verdict\n\n       What was ``the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the \n     century''? The rise of Nazi Germany? The spread of genocide \n     as a tool of state power? Some might say it was the crushing \n     of a host of nations by the totalitarian Soviet Union, at the \n     cost of millions of lives. But not Russian President Vladimir \n     Putin. For him, the greatest catastrophe was not the Soviet \n     Union's rise but its collapse--an event that freed 14 of \n     those nations, from Latvia to Kyrgyzstan, from Moscow's \n     domination. ``The old ideals were destroyed,'' Mr. Putin \n     lamented during his annual state-of-Russia address on Monday.\n       Most accounts of Mr. Putin's speech focused on the passages \n     intended for Western consumption: his claim that ``the \n     development of Russia as a free and democratic state'' is now \n     his highest priority; his assurance to Russian and foreign \n     business executives that their investments will not be seized \n     by rapacious authorities, despite the state's recent \n     confiscation of the country's largest oil company; his \n     announced plans to strengthen political parties and make the \n     state-controlled media more independent.\n       Yet the former KGB officer's nostalgia for the former \n     Soviet empire seemed as telling as any of his promises. So \n     did his denunciation of the ``disintegration'' of Russia \n     before he came to power, which he defined as the \n     ``capitulation'' of granting autonomy to Chechnya and the \n     ``unrestricted control over information flows'' that allowed \n     private business executives to operate newspapers and \n     television networks. Mr. Putin has reversed both of those \n     liberalizations--in Chechnya's case, by means of an ongoing \n     war that has killed tens of thousands.\n       The Russian president has a short-term interest in \n     burnishing what even he must recognize as a tarnished image. \n     Early next month he is due to host numerous world leaders, \n     including President Bush, in a celebration of the Soviet \n     victory in World War II. This summer Mr. Putin is due to take \n     over the rotating leadership of the Group of Eight, a club of \n     industrial democracies in which Russia, an increasingly \n     autocratic state that ranks 97th in the world in per capita \n     gross domestic product, is glaringly out of place.\n       As Mr. Putin acknowledged Monday, his strategy for \n     restoring Russian greatness depends heavily on his ability to \n     attract Western capital and to maintain partnerships with the \n     European Union and the United States.\n       But Mr. Putin would like to achieve these goals while \n     consolidating the Kremlin's restored diktat and reviving what \n     he called ``the Russian nation's civilizing mission in the \n     Eurasian continent.'' That's why the best measures of Mr. \n     Putin are not speeches but actions. One important test will \n     be his handling of neighbors such as Ukraine, Georgia and \n     Moldova, which have embraced democracy and rejected Mr. \n     Putin's neoimperialism. Will he adjust his approach to those \n     countries, and withdraw unwanted Russian troops from Georgia \n     and Moldova?\n       Another comes today at the trial of Mikhail Khodorkovsky, \n     the entrepreneur who built the Yukos oil conglomerate and \n     used it to help finance Russia's liberal democratic \n     opposition. For daring to behave as if Russia were the free \n     and capitalist-friendly country that Mr. Putin describes, Mr. \n     Khodorkovsky was arrested and subjected to a show trial, even \n     as his company, Russia's most modern, was broken up.\n       Today he will receive his verdict; prosecutors have \n     requested a prison sentence of 10 years. The outcome ought to \n     tell the Bush administration and other Western governments \n     something important about a leader who would set the agenda \n     for the world's advanced democracies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/28/senate-section/article/S4538-2", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4538]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      HONORING LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS SLAIN IN THE LINE OF DUTY\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I am proud to be an original cosponsor of \na resolution currently before the Senate commemorating law enforcement \nofficers slain in the line of duty. Every day, men and women all across \nour nation put their lives on the line to protect our citizens, our \nfamilies, and our communities. Having served as Attorney General for \nthe State of Colorado, I know first hand how dedicated our law \nenforcement professionals are, and I strongly believe that one of our \nGovernment's most important priorities is supporting these men and \nwomen--not only by providing them with the resources they need to get \nthe job done, but by publicly recognizing the truly unparalleled work \nthey do each and every day.\n  While we frequently commend law enforcement officers for their \nwillingness to put their lives on the line for the safety and security \nof our citizens, and while we are right to do so, it is still \nunfathomable when one of these men and women does make the ultimate \nsacrifice. It is unfathomable that those who volunteer for such noble \nwork, as well as the families who support them, should pay such a \nprice.\n  Next week, I will be attending a law enforcement memorial event in \nColorado. Like the resolution my colleagues and I are submitting today, \nthis annual event commemorates those law enforcement officers slain in \nthe line of duty. This year, we will remember the lives and work of two \nColorado law enforcement officers killed in the past year: Deputy \nTravis Sass of the Larimer County Sheriff's Office, and Deputy William \nTruesdale of the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office.\n  In memorializing Deputy Sass, Deputy Truesdale, and others like them \nacross the country, we should remember them not for the tragic way they \ndied, but for the noble way they lived--risking their own lives to \nprotect others.

Mr. President, today, I join my colleagues Senators \nCantwell, Craig, Murray, and Smith, in support of S. 206, the Ice Age \nFloods National Geologic Trail Designation Act of 2005.\n  Thousands of years ago, Glacial Lake Missoula broke through its ice \ndam, releasing cataclysmic floods that forever changed the terrain of \nMontana, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington. This natural phenomenon is \nresponsible for the unique beauty of western Montana. However, few \npeople know the history behind our rugged landscape.\n  The Ice Age Floods National Geologic Trail Designation Act of 2005 \ndesignates a trail, primarily public roads and highways, from Missoula, \nMontana\n\n[[Page S4539]]\n\nto the Pacific Ocean, following the path of the great floods. Through \nthis legislation, the National Park Service is responsible for \ncoordinating public and private sector entities to present the story of \nthe ice age floods to the public.\n  Many folks in my great State of Montana, including members of the \nGlacial Lake Missoula Chapter of the Ice Age Floods Institute, look \nforward to working with the National Park Service in a joint effort to \neducate the public. Additionally, designation of the Ice Age Floods \nTrail provides a tremendous opportunity for tourism and economic \ndevelopment in Montana.\n  I am also pleased S. 206 takes into consideration the concerns of \nlocal citizens and private property owners by limiting Federal land \nacquisition to 25 acres. These acres will be used only for \nadministrative and public information purposes. As always, it is \nimportant to me that private property rights are respected and private \nproperty owners do not feel threatened by Federal land acquisitions.\n  I look forward to working with my Senate colleagues to pass this \nimportant piece of legislation for not only Montana but the entire \nPacific Northwest.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/28/senate-section/article/S4539-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4539]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HOSPICE CARE\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe following article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Tallahassee Democrat, Mar. 28, 2005]\n\n           Hospice Offers Patients Expert, Compassionate Care\n\n                          (By Jack D. Gordon)\n\n       Watching the Terri Schiavo case unfold, we have gotten an \n     education that many would no doubt rather not get. Through \n     the news media, we've learned the mechanics of feeding tubes, \n     the importance of advance directives and living wills. We've \n     tried to understand the difference between a persistent \n     vegetative state and a coma.\n       What we haven't really been educated about is the hospice \n     care of Mrs. Schiavo. Lurking dangerously close to the \n     surface of Schiavo controversy, quietly simmering, is the \n     false and dangerous illusion that hospice is a place that \n     hastens death, that it and those who do hospice work are in \n     some way accomplices.\n       Sure, we have gotten a glimpse of Woodside Hospice in \n     Pinellas Park--we've watched the protestors outside, we've \n     seen photos of the family huddling inside, we've learned that \n     it's where Mrs. Schiavo's feeding tube was removed. But for \n     too many, Woodside Hospice is still one of those mysterious \n     places where people go to die.\n       Yet hospice isn't ``a place'' at all. Hospice is a \n     philosophy of care focused on pain relief and symptom \n     management, and hospice is care given mostly in people's \n     homes. It can also be provided in a nursing home, assisted \n     living facility, a hospital, and--or, as in Mrs. Schiavo's \n     case--in an inpatient hospice facility.\n       No one is ever forced to use hospice care. People either \n     choose hospice care themselves or their health care \n     surrogate, designated as responsible for their best interest, \n     makes the decision. A physician outside of hospice is also \n     involved. He or she must certify that the patient's illness \n     is terminal and that life expectancy is six months or less.\n       Hospice clinicians are experts at providing comfort in the \n     final months, weeks, days, hours and minutes. In many cases, \n     there is time and opportunity to address family, spiritual \n     and psychological concerns with hospice professionals, who \n     work in teams that include physicians, nurses, social \n     workers, physical therapists, and clergy.\n       It is not usual for those under hospice care to outlive \n     their life expectancy of six months or less. In a study \n     conducted by the University of South Florida, it was found \n     that persons with cancer who received hospice care lived an \n     average of one day longer than the same patient, by age, \n     gender and diagnosis, who were cared for in acute care \n     facilities such as hospitals.\n       Our ignorance of hospice isn't so surprising. On our \n     nation's health care timeline, it's a relative newcomer, but \n     it has been gaining in use each year. The first U.S. hospice, \n     an inpatient facility, opened in 1974. In 1978 there were \n     about 1,000 people in the United States who died under \n     hospice care. In 1983, it officially entered the mainstream \n     when it became a Medicare benefit. By 2003, 885,000 people \n     died under hospice care. This year, close to a million people \n     in the United States--or one-third of all who die--will die \n     under hospice care.\n       Despite its monumental growth, there has been no widespread \n     government outreach effort around publicizing the benefits of \n     hospice care. Hospice physicians and nurses, in the midst of \n     new technologies, therapies, drugs and procedures, march on, \n     quietly accepting what no one to date has successfully \n     escaped--death. They do this by helping the terminally ill \n     die dignified deaths free from artificial life support or \n     ineffective treatments. They employ the latest methods to \n     relieve pain and control symptoms, but their mission is not \n     to cure. Admittedly, in our culture that rejects illness and \n     aging, that's tough medicine for many to swallow.\n       No matter what your opinion of the Schiavo case, be happy \n     that Mrs. Schiavo is being cared for by people who have \n     helped thousands of people experience a gentle and caring \n     end. And know that the hospice in your community will not be \n     making the decision of whether you will live or die, but if \n     you should become seriously and terminally ill and choose \n     hospice, know that the nation's more than 40,000 hospice \n     workers are committed to the highest quality comfort care \n     under medical guidelines.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/28/senate-section/article/S4539-2", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4539]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              JAMES MONROE\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to recognize James \nMonroe, a Virginian patriot, on the 247th anniversary of his birth and \nhonor his service to our Nation as a soldier, a diplomat, a legislator \nand as the fifth President of the United States of America. As the \nNation draws closer to the celebrations being planned to honor \nPresident Monroe's 250th birthday, I rise today to honor his undeniable \nlegacy.\n  James Monroe, born April 28, 1758, in Westmoreland County, was born, \nraised and educated in the Commonwealth of Virginia. Foregoing his \nstudies at the College of William and Mary, James Monroe joined the \nWilliamsburg Militia in 1775 in defiance of the British King. He served \ngallantly in the Continental Army on the battlefield at Harlem Heights, \nWhite Plains, Trenton, Brandywine, Germantown, and Monmouth, eventually \nrising to the rank of lieutenant colonel.\n  A student of Thomas Jefferson's after serving in the Revolutionary \nWar, James Monroe was an adherent of Mr. Jefferson's principles of \nindividual freedom and restrained representative government, which \nwould guide him through 50 years of public service. Elected to the \nVirginia General Assembly in 1782, Monroe served in the Confederate \nCongress and in the first U.S. Senate before his first of two terms as \nMinister to France. He returned to his Virginia, and as many students \nof Mr. Jefferson have done since, served 4 years as Governor.\n  During Thomas Jefferson's Presidency, James Monroe returned to France \nand was essential in the negotiation of the Louisiana Purchase in 1803. \nHis foreign policy experience led James Madison to name him both \nSecretary of State and Secretary of War as the United States was once \nagain pulled into war with Great Britain in 1812.\n  Elected President of the United States in 1816, Monroe's Presidency \nhas long been referred to as the Era of Good Feeling. During this time \nhe helped resolve longstanding grievances with the British, acquired \nFlorida from the Spanish in 1819, signed the Missouri Compromise and \nrenounced European intervention or dominion in the Western Hemisphere \nwith one of our Nation's greatest foreign policy documents, the Monroe \nDoctrine.\n  In 1820, Monroe achieved an impressive re-election, losing only one \nelectoral vote, reserving the honor of a unanimous election for George \nWashington alone.\n  My own family has strong ties to the legacy of James Monroe. My wife \nSusan and I enjoyed our wedding on the grounds of his home, Ashlawn-\nHighland, in Charlottesville where her family has worked for many \nyears. In fact, part of Monroe's property in Albemarle County is now on \nthe grounds of his teacher's great institution of learning, the \nUniversity of Virginia and is respectfully referred to as Monroe's \nHill.\n  The life of James Monroe is one that embodied virtue, honor and \ncommitment during his accomplished life of public service. It is \nfitting that he would pass from this Earth on July 4, 1831.\n  It is with sincere admiration that I respectfully ask my colleagues \nto recognize James Monroe's 247th birthday as a reminder of his \nremarkable and magnificent leadership for the people of Virginia and \nthe United States of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/28/senate-section/article/S4539-3", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4539-S4540]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              DAVID WILKINS NOMINATED AMBASSADOR TO CANADA\n\n  Mr. DeMINT.

One of South Carolina's most distinguished native sons, \nState House Speaker David Wilkins, has been nominated by President \nGeorge W. Bush to be the United States Ambassador to Canada.\n  I just spoke with David this morning, and let him know that while we \nare sad to lose his leadership, we are extremely proud of his \nappointment.\n  Both David and I are natives of Greenville, SC, and graduates of \nClemson University and have been friends for a long time.\n  I have long admired his courage and determination to fight for family \nvalues and individual freedom. He also possesses a keen understanding \nof the need to create an economic environment that gives businesses and \nworkers a chance to thrive.\n  In addition to the talents David brings to this position, his \ngreatest help will come from his lovely wife Susan, who represents the \nbest of South Carolina. Together they have raised two fine sons, James \nand Robert.\n  Speaker Wilkins is a legendary public servant. He has served in the \nSouth Carolina State House of Representatives since 1981 and led as \nSpeaker for more than a decade.\n  David is widely respected by all parties for good reason, because he \nworks passionately to better the lives of all South Carolinians. The \nPresident could not have chosen a better man, and he will represent our \nnation well.\n  I look forward to welcoming David to Washington for his confirmation \nhearings. I promised him I would work hard to make sure my colleagues \nknow of his exceptional abilities that make him more than qualified for \nthis job\n  He enjoys the full confidence of the President of the United States, \nand the support of South Carolinians.

Mr. President, this day is an important occasion for folks \nin my State of Montana. This afternoon, at 4 o'clock, the National \nAcademy of Sciences will release an extensive report on health effects \nresulting from nuclear bomb tests that were carried out at the Nevada \ntest site in the 1950s and 1960s.\n  For years now, Montanans and their loved ones have experienced the \npain of developing various forms of cancer, most commonly, cancer of \nthe thyroid, caused by exposure to this dangerous radiation. These \ncancers seemed to be a little too common among people living in certain \nareas of our State. According to the National Academy of Sciences, \nthese innocent victims--mostly children and babies--who were living in \nMontana, were exposed to the highest dosages of radiation of any State \nin the Nation as a result ofthis nuclear testing; even more than \nNevada, where the tests were actually conducted. You see, the \nradioactive iodine is the part that is dangerous. It was blasted high \nup into the atmosphere and the wind carried it north to Montana where \nit finally settled on the ground, then into the water and food supply.\n  Thyroid cancer takes around 10 to 40 years to develop. Radiation \nexposure in the late 1950s might not manifest in cancer until the late \n1990s. While the national average for thyroid cancer has remained \nsteady over the past 30 years, the rate of reported thyroid cancer in \nMontana has increased steadily. In 1980, Montana State had a rate of \nthyroid cancer 6.2 times the national average. In 1990, that rate had \nincreased to 10.8 times the national average, and in 2000 the rate of \nreported thyroid cancer in Montana was almost 18 times the national \naverage.\n  The 1990 Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, RECA, PL 101-426, \nestablished the Radiation Exposure Compensation Trust Fund for claims \nfor injuries and death due to exposure from the Nevada testing. Under \nRECA, folks who were residing in parts of the States of Utah, Nevada, \nArizona, Colorado, New Mexico during certain times in the 1950s \nreceived a substantial amount of compensation from the U.S. Government \nalong with an apology. Research now proves the State of Montana was hit \nthe hardest by this radiation; yet its victims are not eligible for \ncompensation under RECA.\n  Not only do these folks deserve an apology from the U.S. Government, \nbut they deserve this compensation. As a cancer survivor, I cannot \nbegin to tell you the mental, emotional, physical and financial \nhardship these cancer victims have endured--in order to serve the \nnational security interests of the United States.\n  I strongly recommend that we, as a Congress, apologize to these \nindividuals and amend RECA to compensate folks from my State of Montana \nas well as other States who have been affected by this tragedy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/28/senate-section/article/S4540-2", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4540]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUSTRALIAN PARTICIPATION IN IRAQ\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I have spoken here previously about the \ncontribution that one of our closest allies, Australia, has made to \nsupport our efforts in Iraq and in the ongoing war against terror. At a \ntime when other members of the international coalition in Iraq are \nbeginning to draw down or remove their forces from the region, \nAustralia continues to do its part.\n  In fact, over the following weeks, Australia will expand its \ncommitment to Iraq by about 50 percent. This will increase the total \nAustralian military personnel currently working in or around Iraq to \n1,370. These additional Australian troops will provide a secure \nenvironment--following the withdrawal of Dutch troops--for Japanese \nengineers who are involved in the reconstruction efforts in the Al \nMuthanna Province in southern Iraq. The additional troop commitment \nwill also bolster the existing training of Iraqi forces by Australian \ntroops--training which is essential to the successful transformation of \nIraq into a secure democracy.\n  Australia has always been a great friend and ally of ours. It shares \na tradition of democracy and a dedication to the values of freedom and \nrespect for life that we hold dear in the United States. Australia is, \nin fact, the only nation to have sent forces to fight alongside the \nUnited States in every major conflict during the 20th century, \nincluding Afghanistan, the first gulf war, Vietnam, Korea, and both \nWorld Wars.\n  Sixty-eight years ago, when Americans and Australians fought \nalongside one another at the Battle of the Coral Sea, during the \ndarkest days of the Second World War, only 12 democracies survived on \nthe face of the earth. The United States and Australia were 2 of the \n12. Today, when more people vote for their own governments than ever \nbefore, and as fledgling democracies emerge in the Middle East and \nEastern Europe, it is important to remember how precious democracy is, \nand to recognize and thank our allies, such as Australia, who have \nalways stood beside us and fought in the defense of liberty.\n  Earlier this month, I traveled with Senator Reid and six other \nSenators to Iraq, Israel, the Palestinian Territories, Georgia, and \nUkraine. During that trip it was clear that the Iraqi elections--the \nbravery of the Iraqi people in staring down intimidation and violence \nto go to the ballot box--had been an inspiration to that part of the \nworld. But, in the short term, democracy in Iraq can only take hold \nwith the continued support of coalition troops--including those from \nAustralia.\n  So I thank the Australian troops and the Australian people for the \ncrucial help they continue to provide to this important mission in \nIraq. Prime Minister Howard and Foreign Minister Downer have shown \nleadership and courage in standing with us in this difficult time. \nTheir support is important to building on the success of January's \nelections so that Iraq may continue on its difficult path toward \ndemocracy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/28/senate-section/article/S4540-3", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4540-S4541]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        PUBLICATION OF PHOTOGRAPHS OF ABUSE AT ABU GHRAIB PRISON\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, one year ago today, the horrific photos of \ndetainee abuse at Abu Ghraib prison shocked the Nation and tarnished \nour reputation as the world's human rights leader. One year later, we \nshould be able to assure the world that the detainee abuse scandal has \nbeen independently and comprehensively investigated and that all those \ninvolved, from the people who committed abuses\n\n[[Page S4541]]\n\nto the officials who set these policies in motion, have been held \naccountable. Sadly, we cannot give the world this assurance. The \nadministration continues to stonewall on the prisoner abuse scandal and \nCongress continues to abdicate its oversight responsibility on this \nissue.\n  Those of us in the Congress who strongly believe that oversight and \naccountability are paramount to restoring America's reputation as a \nhuman rights leader remain stymied in our efforts to learn the truth \nabout how this administration's policies trickled down from offices in \nWashington to cellblocks in Abu Ghraib. This Senate refuses to consider \nan independent commission, relying instead on the piecemeal \ninvestigations conducted by the military, none of which address the \nsignificant role of the Central Intelligence Agency in interrogations. \nWith the completion of each of the Pentagon investigations, the need \nfor a comprehensive, independent investigation becomes all the more \nevident.\n  I am particularly disturbed by recent press reports about the Army \nInspector General's investigation into the Abu Ghraib abuse scandal. \nAlthough the report has not yet been publicly released, the press \naccounts state that Lt. Gen. Ricardo Sanchez has been cleared by the \nArmy of all allegations of wrongdoing and likely will not face \npunishment.\n  In order to understand why the reported findings of the Army \nInspector General are troubling, and why an independent investigation \nis necessary, we need only consult the reports of prior investigations. \nThe Jones investigation, referring to the Combined Joint Task Force led \nby Lt. Gen. Sanchez, stated, ``Inaction at the CJTF-7 staff level may . \n. . have contributed to the failure to discover and prevent abuses \nbefore January 2004.'' The Jones report concluded that Lt. Gen. Sanchez \n``failed to ensure proper staff oversight of detention and \ninterrogation operations.''\n  The Schlesinger investigation is even more critical of Lt. Gen. \nSanchez's role in the detainee abuse scandal. The Schlesinger panel \ndescribed how Lt. Gen. Sanchez relied upon the interrogation policy \nfrom Guantanamo Bay to develop interrogation procedures for Iraq. The \nresult of this, as the Schlesinger panel correctly states, was that \n``policies approved for use on al Qaeda and Taliban detainees who were \nnot afforded the protection of [Enemy Prisoner of War] status under the \nGeneva Conventions now applied to detainees who did fall under the \nGeneva Convention protections.'' The Schlesinger report continued, \n``Despite lacking specific authorization to operate beyond the confines \nof the Geneva Conventions, [Lt. Gen. Sanchez] nonetheless determined it \nwas within [his] command discretion to classify, as unlawful \ncombatants, individuals captured during [Operation Iraqi Freedom].'' \nThe panel also found that Lt. Gen. Sanchez ``was responsible for \nestablishing the confused command relationship at the Abu Ghraib \nprison'' and ``the unclear chain of command established by CJTF-7, \ncombined with the poor leadership and lack of supervision, contributed \nto the atmosphere at Abu Ghraib that allowed the abuses to take \nplace.''\n  The findings of the Jones and the Schlesinger investigations \nregarding the decisions of Lt. Gen. Sanchez are troubling on their own. \nEqually troubling is the indication that Lt. Gen. Sanchez gave \ninaccurate testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee. In an \nArmed Services Committee hearing on May 19, 2004, Senator Jack Reed \nasked Lt. Gen. Sanchez if he had approved sleep deprivation, \nintimidation by guard dogs, excessive noise, and inducing fear as \ninterrogation methods for use in Abu Ghraib prison. Lt. Gen. Sanchez \nreplied that, ``I never approved any of those measures to be used \nwithin CJTF-7 at any time in the last year.'' His statement is \nseemingly contradicted by a document recently released by the Pentagon \nin response to litigation under the Freedom of Information Act. A \nSeptember 14, 2003, memo from Lt. Gen. Sanchez authorized specific \ninterrogation methods for use in Iraq, including the use of military \nworking dogs to exploit Arab fear of dogs, the use of sleep management \nand stress positions, and inducing fear through ``yelling, loud music, \nand light control.''\n  There has been some speculation in the media about whether Gen. \nSanchez's actions in Iraq will stand in the way of his promotion and \nfourth star. But involvement in the prisoner abuse scandal is hardly a \ncareer-ending event in this administration. Alberto Gonzales, the \ncentral figure in formulating the administration's interrogation and \ndetention policies, was promoted to Attorney General. Former Assistant \nAttorney General Jay Bybee, author of the deeply flawed and now-\nrepudiated ``torture memo,'' received a lifetime appointment to the \nCourt of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Defense Department General \nCounsel William J. Haynes insisted that the Pentagon Working Group use \nthe Bybee torture memo, rather than the Geneva Conventions, as the \nlegal foundation for interrogation techniques; he has been nominated to \nthe Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. Former CIA Director George \nTenet authorized the ``extraordinary rendition'' of detainees to \ncountries where they were reported to have been tortured; he was \nawarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Secretary Rumsfeld \npersonally approved objectionable interrogation techniques and admitted \nto hiding detainees from the International Committee of the Red Cross; \nhe is one of the few cabinet members asked to remain in the second Bush \nterm.\n  Allowing senior officials and military officers to avoid \naccountability sets a dangerous precedent. It is time for Congress, \neven this Republican-led Congress, to recognize its constitutional \nobligation to conduct vigorous oversight. We must send a message that \nno one in the chain of command--from an enlisted private stationed in \nIraq to the Commander-in-Chief--is above the laws of our Nation. Many \nRepublicans argue that another investigation will hurt the morale of \nour troops serving overseas. On the contrary, I believe that morale is \nhurt when the only individuals who have been punished for detainee \nabuse are low-ranking soldiers, while those at the highest levels of \npower continue to set policy and act with impunity.\n  Chairman Warner recently announced that he will hold an Armed \nServices Committee hearing to examine the adequacy of the various \nPentagon and military investigations. I commend the chairman for \nannouncing this hearing, and hope that the supporters of an independent \ninvestigation are given the opportunity to testify before the \ncommittee. In a letter last September, eight retired generals and \nadmirals asked President Bush to appoint a prisoner abuse commission \nmodeled on the 9/11 Commission. In that letter, the officers stated, \n``internal investigations by their nature . . . suffer from a critical \nlack of independence. Americans have never thought it wise or fair for \none branch of government to police itself.'' I hope that members of the \nArmed Services Committee will consider these words when they evaluate \nthe Pentagon's investigations.\n  April 28, 2004, will remain a dark day in American history, but the \nadministration's handling of this scandal only adds to our disgrace. \nThere will always be scandals and tragedies in a nation's history.

This award is presented to one facility nationwide \nthat has set itself apart from others in quality and innovation in \ncommunity health care. The center has distinguished itself over the \nyears in superior service to the Coeur d'Alene Tribe, the community of \nPlummer, ID, and the medically underserved and indigent in the region. \nTheirs is a story of successful partnership and innovation over the \ncourse of many years. Fifteen years ago, the center collaborated with \nthe city of Plummer and greatly expanded the scope\n\n[[Page S4542]]\n\nand reach of its service. In addition to acute and preventive health \ncare found at other medical centers, the many programs offered by the \ncenter make it a truly comprehensive care institution. These programs \ninclude diabetes and cardiovascular disease prevention and education \nand afterschool and mentoring programs for youth. Furthermore, the \ncenter has responded to the cultural sensitivities of the community by \nemploying Native and non-Native staff members. Staff diversity \nincreases the effectiveness of any healthcare institution, a fact which \nthe center has recognized and incorporated into their operating \nprocedures. In January 2004, I had the opportunity to visit the center \nand was impressed at the level of technology this collaborative effort \nhad been able to bring to this rural community.\n  I commend the Benewah Medical and Wellness Center on its tremendous \nachievement in the overall community healthcare and wellness. I look \nforward to hearing of future successes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/28/senate-section/article/S4542-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4542]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nHONORING CENTURY COUNCIL FOR NATIONAL PROM AND GRADUATION SAFETY MONTH \n                               INITIATIVE\n\n Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise today in honor of Alcohol \nAwareness Month to recognize The Century Council for its efforts to \nprevent underage drinking. The Century Council is a national, not for \nprofit organization funded by America's leading distillers to develop \nand implement programs designed to combat drunk driving and underage \ndrinking. These programs, such as Ready or Not: Talking with Kids About \nAlcohol, Brandon's Story, and Alcohol 101 Plus, are making great \nstrides in reducing the amount of underage drinking and irresponsible \nconsumption of alcohol.\n  Right now, The Council is kicking off its sixth annual National Prom \nand Graduation Safety Months Initiative. Between April and June, The \nCouncil has planned a series of events across the country to educate \nstudents, parents and the general public about making responsible \ndecisions with regard to beverage alcohol. Over the past two decades, \nprogress has been made in the effort to stop underage drinking through \nthe implementation of effective programs and increased public awareness \nregarding the negative consequences of underage drinking. According to \nthe most recent figures from the National Highway Traffic Safety \nAdministration, 749 people under the age of 21 were killed in alcohol-\nrelated traffic crashes during April, May and June in 2003 as well as \ncountless non-fatal injuries. In Louisiana, alcohol is a factor in 20 \npercent of all traffic fatalities involving minors, and it is a factor \nin 15 percent of all traffic accidents involving minors.\n  It was once said that ``holding young people solely responsible for \nunderage drinking is like holding fish responsible for dying in a \npolluted stream.'' As a mother of two young children, I know that I \nwill soon have to speak to my own kids about alcohol use. As all of the \nother parents in this Chamber and across the country can say, the \nconversation between a parent and a child about alcohol use is not \nalways an easy conversation. However, improved communication between \nparents and children is essential to preventing underage drinking. \nAccording to a recent survey by TRU Omnibuzz in 2003, 65 percent of \nadolescents identify parents as the leading influence in their decision \nto drink or not to drink. Unfortunately, 36 percent of adolescents say \nthey had not spoken to either parent about alcohol. This communication \ngap can be minimized by through programs that increase awareness, \neducate parents and kids and help facilitate conversations between \nparents and kids about the dangers of underage drinking.\n  The role of parents in the efforts to reduce underage drinking is \ncritical. I commend The Century Council for giving parents and children \nacross the Nation the valuable tools to initiate those important \ndiscussions regarding alcohol.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/28/senate-section/article/S4542-2", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4542]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    CONGRATULATING JERRY VEREEN AND RIVERSIDE MANUFACTURING COMPANY\n\n Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I congratulate Riverside \nManufacturing Company on Riverside being named ``Manufacturer of the \nYear'' for the State of Georgia. Riverside is located in my hometown of \nMoultrie, GA. Riverside was founded in 1911 by William J. Vereen, in \nColquitt County, and has maintained its headquarters there to this day. \nRiverside is known worldwide both for producing business uniforms of \nsuperior garment quality and for the dedication of its employees.\n  Riverside sells uniforms in all 50 States, as well as in over 200 \nforeign countries. Riverside warehouses products in Atlanta, GA; \nDundalk, Ireland; Moultrie, GA; Prichard, WV; and Reno, NV. Riverside \nwon this year's distinction of Georgia's Manufacturer of the Year in \nthe large company category; that is, those with more than 750 \nemployees. Riverside was nominated for the award by Moultrie Technical \nCollege.\n  Governor Sonny Perdue presented this coveted award to my good friend \nJerry Vereen, who is president and chief executive officer of \nRiverside, last Thursday in Atlanta at an annual awards ceremony as \npart of Georgia Manufacturing Appreciation Week.\n  Jerry was quoted as saying:\n\n       We were very pleased that the award recognized all the \n     dedication and hard work that Riverside's associates have put \n     forth to look after all our great customers. The only \n     sustainable competitive advantage any company can have is \n     based strictly on its people. You can buy technology, \n     equipment and buildings but it takes the dedication of a lot \n     of people to give Riverside the competitive edge with our \n     customers, especially when all of our competitors have taken \n     their manufacturing offshore. This award recognizes our \n     associates' dedication to exceeding our customers' \n     expectations. It also acknowledges their efforts to \n     contribute significantly to the communities where we are \n     located. We feel that Colquitt County and Georgia are great \n     areas to build a company. We are very appreciative to Jackie \n     Rohosky and her Quick Start team, Tina Anderson and her \n     Moultrie Technical College team, Darrell Moore, Jimmy Jeter \n     and the members of the Moultrie Colquitt County Industrial \n     Development Authority, as well as the Colquitt County \n     Commissioners, Moultrie City Council and the Colquitt County \n     Chamber of Commerce for all the assistance they have given \n     Riverside and our associates over the years.\n\n  I am so proud of Jerry, of Riverside, and of all of Riverside's many \nemployees, 600 of which call Georgia home. I extend my deepest and most \nsincere congratulations on their receipt of this prestigious award in \nrecognition of a job well done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/28/senate-section/article/S4542-3", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4542]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  HONORING EAST BRUNSWICK HIGH SCHOOL\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG.

Upon graduation, he joined his uncle, the late Paul O'Dwyer, \nat the law firm of O'Dwyer and Bernstien. As a trial lawyer, Frank has \nan excellent reputation as an advocate for injured plaintiffs. For half \na century he has been a defender of civil rights in Federal courts from \nNew Hampshire to Texas. Frank epitomizes those who come to our shores \nfollowing the American dream and enrich our institutions through their \nhard work and dedication.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/28/senate-section/article/S4543-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4543]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO KIP JANVRIN\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a native \nIowan and a remarkable athletic champion, Kip Janvrin. Today marks the \nbeginning of the 96th annual Drake Relays, one of the Nation's most \nprestigious track and field events, held each spring at Drake Stadium \nin Des Moines. Kip will take the field for the last time in a sport in \nwhich he has dominated at Drake for the last 22 years, the decathlon.\n  The Relays are aptly called ``Americas Athletic Classic.'' This will \nbe the last year they are held in the old Drake Stadium. This summer, \nthe stadium will get a dramatic face-lift and overhaul in order to \nconform to national and international standards.\n  Over the years, the words ``Drake Relays and Kip Janvrin'' have \nbecome virtually synonymous. The Drake Relays are one of America's \npremier track and field venues, and Kip Janvrin is one of America's \npremier track and field athletes, competing in what is arguably the \nmost demanding event in all of sports. From Jesse Owens to Wilma \nRudolph, Gwen Torrance, Carl Lewis and Michael Johnson, the Drake \nRelays have seen almost all of the great Olympians in track and field. \nBut one Olympian, Kip Janvrin, has been a dominant presence at the \nevent for more than two decades.\n  If the cheers are especially loud for Kip, it is because he is a \nnative son of Iowa. Raised in Panora and a graduate of Simpson College \nin Indianola, Kip has won the decathalon at the Drake Relays a \nremarkable 14 times. It is fitting that the last year for the original \nDrake Stadium will also be the last year that this American original \ncompetes in the Drake Relays.\n  Kip is one of the top-ranked decathletes in the world, and he is the \noldest active U.S. competitor in this extraordinarily demanding event. \nThe decathlon is a 10-event competition which takes place over two \ndays. It includes the 100 meter dash, long jump, shot put, high jump, \n400 meter dash, 110 meter hurdles, discus, pole vault, javelin and \n1,500 meter run. Kip began competing in the decathlon in 1983, and \nquickly excelled in all 10 events.\n  While attending Simpson College, Kip competed many times in the Drake \nRelays. His first victory came in 1987 in the decathlon, and he went on \nto add 13 more titles over the next 18 years. His 14 championships at \nthe Drake Relays are the most by any athlete in the history of that \nevent. In 1998, he was inducted into the Drake Relays Hall of Fame. \nDuring his years at Simpson, he earned 3 NCAA titles in the decathlon, \nand 2 more NCAA titles in individual events. He was inducted into the \nSimpson Hall of Fame in 1998, and the NCAA Division III Track and Field \nHall of Fame in 2004.\n  Kip's accomplishments are nothing short of amazing. He has completed \nmore than 80 decathlons. He holds the world records in career \nvictories, scores over 7,000 points, and consecutive finishes. He also \nholds the world record for the double decathlon, a grueling event \ninvolving every event in track and field, except for the marathon and \nwalks.\n  Kip won the decathlon at the 1995 Pan American Games. As a member of \nthe U.S. Olympic team at the 2000 Games in Sydney, Australia, he was \nthe oldest decathlete ever to compete for the United States. In 2001, \nhe won the decathlon at the USA Outdoor Championships. Last year, Kip \ncame in second at the Drake Relays, the first time in 9 years that he \ndid not come in first. However, Kip took the loss in stride, because \nthe victor was his protege, Travis Goepfert, also a native of Panora, \nIA.\n  Kip is currently in his 15th year as co-head coach at Central \nMissouri State University in Warrensburg. He and his wife, Teresa, have \ntwo sons, Jaxon, age 9, and Mason, age 7.\n  So as Kip Janvrin warms up for his final Drake Relays, I extend my \ncongratulations and best wishes. With his self discipline, his \ncommitment to excellence, and his enormous human decency, he represents \nIowa at its very best. I wish him success in this, his final, Drake \nRelays. Win or lose, he will be a true champion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/28/senate-section/article/S4543-2", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4543]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/28/senate-section/article/S4543-3", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4543]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/28/senate-section/article/S4543-4", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4543]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:08 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 748.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for improvements in access to services in rural hospitals and \ncritical access hospitals; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, today I join Senator Brownback \nin introducing The Rural Community Hospital Assistance Act. This \nlegislation is intended to ensure the future of small rural hospitals \nby restructuring the way they are reimbursed for Medicare services by \nbasing the reimbursements on actual costs instead of the current pre-\nset cost structure.\n  Current law allows for very small hospitals--designated Critical \nAccess Hospitals (CAH) to receive cost-based Medicare reimbursements. \nTo qualify as a CAH the facility must have no more than 25 acute care \nbeds.\n  In rural communities, hospital facilities that are slightly larger \nthan the 25 bed limit share with Critical Access Hospitals the same \neconomic conditions, the same treatment challenges, the same disparity \nin coverage area but do not share the same reimbursement arrangement. \nThese rural hospitals have to compete with larger urban-based hospitals \nthat can perform the same services at drastically reduced costs. They \nare also discouraged from investing in technology and other methods to \nimprove the quality of care in their communities because those \ninvestments are not supported by Medicare reimbursement procedures.\n  The legislation would provide enhanced cost-based Medicare \nreimbursement by creating a new ``rural'' designation under the \nMedicare reimbursement system. This new designation would benefit five \nNebraska hospitals. Hospitals in McCook, Beatrice, Columbus, Holdrege \nand Lexington would fall under this new designation, and would have \nsimilar benefits provided to nearly sixty other Nebraska hospitals \nclassified under the CAH system.\n  The legislation would also improve the hospitals with critical access \nstatus. Sixty CAH facilities in Nebraska already receive enhanced cost-\nbased reimbursements for inpatient and outpatient services. The \nlegislation would further assist these existing CAH facilities by \nextending the enhanced cost-based reimbursement to certain post-acute \nand ambulance services and eliminating the current 35-mile test.\n  Rural hospitals cannot continue to provide these services without \nhaving Medicare cover the costs. If something is not done, the larger \nhospitals may be forced to cut back on the number of beds they keep--\nand the number of people they care for, and others may be forced to \nclose their doors. These hospitals provide jobs, good wages, health \ncare and economic development opportunity for these communities. \nWithout access to these hospitals, these communities would not survive. \nThe Rural Community Hospital Assistance Act will ensure that the \ncommunity has access to high quality health care that is affordable to \nthe patient and the provider.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself and Mr. Graham):\n  S. 934. A bill to establish an expedited procedure for congressional \nconsideration of health care reform legislation; to the Committee on \nRules and Administration.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am pleased to be joined by the \nSenator from South Carolina, Mr. Graham, in introducing legislation \nthat requires Congress to act on what may be the most pressing domestic \npolicy issue of our time, namely health care reform.\n  I travel to each of Wisconsin's 72 counties every year to hold town \nhall meetings. Year after year, the number one issue raised at these \nlistening sessions is the same--health care. The failure of our health \ncare system brings people to these meetings in droves. The frustration \nI hear, the anger and the desperation, have convinced me that we must \nchange the system.\n  So many people now come to tell me that they used to think government \ninvolvement was a terrible idea, but not anymore. Now they tell me that \ntheir businesses are being destroyed by health care costs, and they \nwant the government to step in. These costs are crippling our economy \njust as the nation is struggling to rebound from the loss of millions \nof manufacturing jobs.\n  Our health care system has failed to keep costs in check. Costs are \nskyrocketing, and there is simply no way we can expect businesses to \nkeep up. So in all too many cases, employers are left to offer sub-par \nbenefits, or to wonder whether they can offer any benefits at all. \nEmployers cannot be the sole provider of health care when these costs \nare rising faster than inflation.\n  One option that could help employers, especially small businesses, \nreduce their health care costs is to have them form health care \ncooperatives, where employers lower costs by purchasing care as a \ngroup. I have introduced a bill in the Senate to make it easier for \nbusiness to create these cooperatives.\n  But that legislation certainly isn't the magic bullet that can \naddress the whole problem. We need to come up with more comprehensive \nways to address rising costs. In most cases, costs are still passed on \nto employees, who then face enormous premiums that demand more and more \nof their monthly income. People tell me that they don't understand how \nanyone can afford these astronomical premiums, and what can you say to \nthat?\n  Well, we can say that it's time to move toward universal coverage. I \nbelieve we can find a way to make universal coverage work in this \ncountry. Universal coverage doesn't mean that we have to copy a system \nalready in place in another country. We can harness our Nation's \ncreativity and entrepreneurial spirit to design a system that is \nuniquely American. Universal coverage doesn't have to be defined by \nwhat's been attempted in the past. What universal coverage does mean is \nending a system where approximately 45 million Americans are uninsured, \nand where too many of those who are insured are struggling to pay their \npremiums, struggling to pay for prescription drugs, and struggling to \nfind long term care.\n  We can't tolerate a system that strands so many Americans without the \ncoverage they need. This system costs us dearly: Even though an \nestimated 45 million Americans are uninsured, the United States devotes \nmore of its economy to health care than other industrial countries.\n  Leaving this many Americans uninsured affects all of us. Those who \nare insured pay more because the uninsured can't afford to pay their \nbills. And those bills are exceptionally high, because the uninsured \nwait so long to see a doctor. The uninsured often live sicker, and die \nearlier, than other Americans, so they also need a disproportionate \namount of acute care.\n  In 2001 alone, health care providers provided $35 billion worth of \nuncompensated care. While providers absorb some of those costs, \ninevitably some of the burden is shifted to other patients. And of \ncourse the process of cost-shifting itself generates additional costs.\n  We are all paying the price for our broken health care system, and it \nis time to bring about change.\n  Over the years I have heard many different proposals for how we \nshould change the health care system in this country. Some propose \nusing tax incentives as a way to expand access to health care. Others \nthink the best approach is to expand public programs. Some feel a \nnational single payer health care system is the only way to go.\n  I don't think we can ignore any of these proposals. We need to \nconsider all of these as we address our broken health care system.\n  As a former State legislator, I come to this debate knowing that \nStates are coming up with some very innovative solutions to the health \ncare problem.\n\n[[Page S4550]]\n\nSo in addition to the approaches already mentioned, I think we really \nneed to look at what our States are doing, and add to the menu of \npossibilities an approach under which each State decides the best way \nto cover its residents.\n  I favor an American-style health care reform, where we encourage \ncreative solutions to the health care problems facing our country, \nwithout using a one-size-fits-all approach. I believe that states have \na better idea about what the health care needs of their residents are, \nand that they understand what types of reform will work best for their \nState. So I am in favor of a State-based universal health care system, \nwhere States, with the Federal Government's help, come up with a plan \nto make sure that all of their residents have health care coverage.\n  This approach would achieve universal health care, without the \nFederal Government dictating to all of the states exactly how to do it. \nThe Federal Government would provide States with the financial help, \ntechnical assistance and oversight necessary to accomplish this goal. \nIn return, a State would have to make sure that every resident has \ncoverage at least as good as that offered in the Federal Employee \nHealth Benefits Program (FEHBP)--in other words, at least as good as \nthe health insurance Members of Congress have.\n\n  States would have the flexibility to expand coverage in phases, and \nwould be offered a number of Federal ``tools'' to choose from in order \nto help them achieve universal coverage. States could use any number of \nthese tools, or none of them, instead opting for a Federal contribution \nfor a State-based ``single-payer'' system. In addition to designing and \nimplementing a plan to achieve universal care, States would also be \nrequired to provide partial funding of these plans. The Federal \nGovernment would approve each State plan, and would conduct oversight \nof the implementation of these plans.\n  Federal tools that States could choose from to help expand health \ncoverage could include an enhanced Medicaid and SCHIP Federal match for \nexpanding coverage to currently uninsured individuals; refundable and \nadvanceable tax credits for the purchase of health insurance for \nindividuals and/or businesses; the establishment of a community-rated \nhealth pool, similar to FEHBP, to provide affordable health coverage \nand expanded choices for those who enroll; and assistance with \ncatastrophic care costs.\n  States could be creative in the State resources they use to expand \nhealth care coverage. For example, a State could use personal and/or \nemployer mandates for coverage, use State tax incentives, create a \nsingle-payer system or even join with neighboring States to offer a \nregional health care plan.\n  The approach I have set forth would guarantee universal health care, \nbut still leave room for the flexibility and creativity that I believe \nis necessary to ensure that everyone has access to affordable, quality \nhealth care.\n  As I have noted, there have been a number of interesting proposals to \nmove us to universal health care coverage. While I will be advocating \nthe State-based approach that I have just outlined, others have \nproposed alternative approaches that certainly merit consideration and \ndebate.\n  And this brings us to the legislation Senator Graham and I are \nintroducing today, because, the reason we haven't reformed our health \ncare system isn't because of a lack of good ideas. The problem is that \nCongress and the White House refuse to take this issue up. Despite the \noutcry from businesses, from health care providers, and from the tens \nof millions who are uninsured or underinsured or struggling to pay \ntheir premiums, Washington refuses to address the problem in a \ncomprehensive way.\n  That is why we are introducing this bill. Our legislation will force \nCongress to finally address this issue. It requires the Majority and \nMinority Leaders of the Senate, as well as the Chairs of the Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee and the Finance Committee, to \neach introduce a health care reform bill in the first 30 days of the \nsession following enactment of the bill. If a committee chair fails to \nintroduce a bill within the first month, then the ranking minority \nparty member of the respective committee may introduce a measure that \nqualifies for the expedited treatment outlined in my bill.\n  The measures introduced by the Majority Leader and Minority Leader \nwill be placed directly on the Senate Calendar. The measures introduced \nby the two committee chairs, or ranking minority members, will be \nreferred to their respective committees.\n  The committees have 60 calendar days, not including recesses of 3 \ndays or more, to review the legislation. At the end of that time, if \neither committee fails to report a measure, the bills will be placed \ndirectly on the legislative calendar.\n  If the Majority Leader fails to move to one of the bills, any Member \nmay move to proceed to any qualifying health care reform measure. The \nmotion is not debatable or amendable. If the motion to proceed is \nadopted, the Chamber will immediately proceed to the consideration of a \nmeasure without intervening motion, order, or other business, and the \nmeasure remains the unfinished business of the Senate until the body \ndisposes of the bill.\n  Similar procedures are established for House consideration.\n  I want to emphasize, my hill does not prejudge what particular health \ncare reform measure should be debated. There are many worthy proposals \nthat would qualify for consideration, and this bill does not dictate \nwhich proposal, or combination of proposals, should be considered.\n  But what my bill does do is to require Congress to act.\n  It has been over 10 years since the last serious debate over health \ncare reform was killed by special interests and the soft money \ncontributions they used to corrupt the legislative process. The \nlegislative landscape is now much different. Soft money can no longer \nbe used to set the agenda, and businesses and workers are crying out as \nnever before for Congress to do something about the country's health \ncare crisis.\n  It has been over 10 years since we've had any debate on comprehensive \nhealth care reform. We cannot afford any further delay, because I \nbelieve the cost of inaction is too great. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the Reform Health Care Now Act of 2005.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 934\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

If \n     either committee chair fails to introduce the bill within the \n     30-day period, the ranking minority party member of the \n     respective committee may, within the following 30 days, \n     instead introduce a bill that will qualify for the expedited \n     procedure provided in this section.\n       (3) Qualified bill.--\n       (A) In general.--To qualify for the expedited procedure \n     under this section as a qualified bill, the bill shall--\n       (i) reach the goal of providing healthcare coverage to 95 \n     percent of Americans within 10 years; and\n       (ii) be deficit neutral.\n       (B) Determination.--Whether or not a bill meets the \n     criteria in subparagraph (A) shall be determined by the \n     Speaker's ruling on a point of order based on a Congressional \n     Budget Office estimate of the bill.\n       (b) Referral.--\n       (1) Committee bills.--Upon introduction, the bill authored \n     by the Chair of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce \n     shall be referred to that committee and the bill introduced \n     by the Chair of the House Committee on Ways and Means shall \n     be referred to that committee. If either committee has not \n     reported the bill referred to it (or another qualified bill) \n     by the end of 60 days of consideration beginning on the date \n     of referral, the committee shall be automatically discharged \n     from further consideration of the bill, and the bill shall be \n     placed directly on the Calendar of the Whole House on the \n     State of the Union. In calculating the 60-day period, \n     adjournments for more than 3 days are not counted.\n       (2) Leader bills.--The bills introduced by the House \n     Majority Leader and House Minority Leader will, on \n     introduction, be placed directly on the Calendar of the Whole \n     House on the State of the Union.\n       (c) Motion to Proceed.--\n       (1) In general.--On or after the third day following the \n     committee report or discharge or upon a bill being placed on \n     the calendar under subsection (b)(2), it shall be in order \n     for any Member, after consultation with the Majority Leader, \n     to move to proceed to the consideration of any qualified \n     bill. Notice must first be given before proceeding. This \n     motion to proceed to the consideration of a bill can be \n     offered by a Member only on the day after the calendar day on \n     which the Member announces the Member's intention to offer \n     it.\n       (2) Consideration.--The motion to proceed to a given \n     qualified bill can be made even if a motion to the same \n     effect has previously been rejected. No more than 3 such \n     motions may be made, however, in any 1 congressional session.\n       (3) Privileged and nondebatable.--The motion to proceed is \n     privileged, and all points of order against the motion to \n     proceed to consideration and its consideration are waived. \n     The motion is not debatable, is not amendable, and is not \n     subject to a motion to postpone.\n       (4) No other business or reconsideration.--The motion is \n     not subject to a motion to proceed to the consideration of \n     other business. A motion to reconsider the vote by which the \n     motion to proceed is agreed to or disagreed to is not in \n     order.\n       (d) Consideration of a Qualified Bill.--\n       (1) In general.--If the motion to proceed is adopted, the \n     chamber will immediately proceed to the consideration of a \n     qualified bill without intervening motion, order, or other \n     business, and the bill remains the unfinished business of the \n     House until disposed of.\n       (2) Committee of the whole.--The bill will be considered in \n     the Committee of the Whole under the 5-minute rule, and the \n     bill shall be considered as read and open for amendment at \n     any time.\n       (3) Limit debate.--A motion to further limit debate is in \n     order and is not debatable.\n       (4) Relevant amendments.--Only relevant amendments may be \n     offered to the bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Corzine, and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 935. A bill to regulate .50 caliber sniper weapons designed for \nthe taking of human life and the destruction of materiel, including \narmored vehicles and components of the Nation's critical \ninfrastructure; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Fifty Caliber \nSniper Weapons Regulation Act of 2005. I am joined by Senators Corzine \nand Durbin.\n  This bill would add the .50-caliber sniper rifle to the list of \n``firearms'' governed by the National Firearms Act. This means that \nthis weapon would be subject to the tax and registration rules imposed \nby the Internal Revenue Service under that Act. The practical effect \nwould be that a transfer of such a weapon, by sale or by gift, would \nrequire registration pursuant to IRS regulations.\n  The bill would not ban any guns, and existing .50 caliber owners \nwould be unaffected by this law until, and unless, they sell or give \naway their weapon.\n  I believe this is a reasonable compromise, respecting the rights of \nthose who have followed the law, but making future changes in the law \nto regulate new .50-caliber guns.\n  .50-caliber sniper rifles, manufactured by a small handful of \ncompanies, are deadly, military weapons, designed for combat with \nwartime enemies. They are capable of piercing light armor at more than \nfour miles. The guns are designed to enable a single soldier to destroy \nenemy aircraft, HumVees, bunkers, fuel stations, and communication \ncenters, as well as target and kill enemy personnel. As a result, their \nuse by military organizations worldwide has been spreading rapidly.\n  This is a weapon designed to kill people efficiently, or destroy \nmachinery, at a great distance. But along with the increasing military \nuse of the gun, we have also seen increased use of the weapon by \nviolent criminals and terrorists around the world, and the potential \nfor much worse.\n  These weapons are deadly accurate up to 6,000 feet. This means that a \nshooter using a .50-caliber weapon can reliably hit a target more than \na mile away. To further illustrate what this means, a shooter standing \non the steps of the Jefferson Memorial can kill a person standing on \nthe White House lawn, or shoot down the President's helicopter.\n  And the gun is effective at more than four miles. Although it may be \nhard to aim at this distance, the gun will still have its desired \ndestructive effect. That means a shooter in Arlington Cemetery can send \na bullet crashing into this building.\n  This is, of course, is using ordinary ammunition. I had one of my \nstaff members obtain a blank .50-caliber bullet. I was amazed to see \nwhat was brought back. Senate rules forbid me from bringing the bullet \nto the floor, so I will describe it for my colleagues.\n\n[[Page S4552]]\n\nThe casing for this bullet is about five inches in length, and three-\nquarters-of-an-inch in diameter. The entire round is almost as big as \nmy hand.\n  But don't just take my word for it. Each one of my colleagues should \nexamine these bullets for themselves. Take a look at the projectile \nthese weapons fire. This is not a recreational gun that can be used for \nhunting.\n  This gun can be used by civilians against armored limousines, \nbunkers, individuals, and aircraft--in fact, one advertisement for the \ngun promoted the weapon as able to ``wreck several million dollars'' \nworth of jet aircraft with one or two dollars worth of cartridges.''\n  A recent CNN news report powerfully illustrates this issue. In one \non-camera demonstration, a .50 caliber bullet is fired through the door \nof a commercial jetliner--it continues to blast through a steel plate. \nA marksman on the steps of the Capitol could bring down a plane coming \ninto National Airport.\n  This gun is so powerful that one dealer told undercover General \nAccountability Office investigators, ``You'd better buy one soon. It's \nonly a matter of time before someone lets go a round on a range that \ntravels so far, it hits a school bus full of kids. The government will \ndefinitely ban .50-calibers. This gun is just too powerful.'' In fact, \nmany ranges used for target practice do not even have enough safety \nfeatures to accommodate these guns.\n  A study by the GAO revealed some eye-opening facts about how and \nwhere this gun is used, and how easily it is obtained. The GAO reports \nthat many of these guns wind up in the hands of domestic and \ninternational terrorists, religious cults, outlaw motorcycle gangs, \ndrug traffickers, and violent criminals.\n  According to a special agent at ATF's Atlanta Field Division, the \nBarrett .50-caliber rifle is ``a tremendous threat'' for ``those most \nshocking and horrifying crimes, assassinations, murders, assaults on \nlaw enforcement officers.''\n  But these fears are not hypothetical. Recently we have learned that \nAl Qaeda has received .50-caliber sniper rifles--rifles that were \nmanufactured right here in the United States. Nearly two years ago \ntoday, Essam al Ridi, an Al Qaeda associate, testified that he acquired \n25 Barrett .50-caliber sniper rifles and shipped them to Al Qaeda \nmembers in Afghanistan. We have no way of knowing whether Al Qaeda has \nobtained more or who has supplied them with these weapons, but we can \nbe sure that any .50-caliber weapon in the hands of Al Qaeda will \nlikely be used against Americans.\n  In 1998, Federal law enforcement apprehended three men belonging to a \nradical Michigan militia group. The three were charged with plotting to \nbomb Federal office buildings, destroy highways and utilities. They \nwere also charged with plotting to assassinate then-Governor Engler, \nFederal judges, and our colleague, Senator Levin. A .50-caliber sniper \nrifle was found in their possession along with a cache of weapons that \nincluded three illegal machine guns.\n  One doomsday cult headquartered in Montana purchased ten of these \nguns and stockpiled them in an underground bunker, along with thousands \nof rounds of ammunition and other guns.\n  At least one .50-caliber gun was recovered by Mexican authorities \nafter a shoot-out with an international drug cartel in that country. \nThe gun was originally purchased in Wyoming, so it is clear that the \nguns are making their way into the hands of criminals worldwide.\n  The U.S. Air Force has studied the scenario of a potential terrorist \nattack with a .50-caliber weapon. According to a November 2001 article \nin the Air Force's official magazine, Airman, an anti-sniper assessment \nclaimed that planes parked on a fully protected U.S. airbase are as \nvulnerable as ``ducks on a pond'' because the weapons can shoot from \nbeyond most airbase perimeters. The Air Force has addressed the issue \nand the effectiveness of specially-trained countersnipers to respond to \na .50-caliber weapon attack on aircraft, fuel tanks, control towers, \nand personnel.\n  I am glad to know our military has given some consideration to the \nthreats posed by .50-caliber weapons, but I have real concerns over the \nthreats posed to civilian aviation.\n  Our Nation's airports in no way match the security measure at Air \nForce bases. These commercial facilities handle millions of passengers \nand tons of cargo each day and are especially vulnerable to the threats \nposed by .50-caliber weapons.\n  Experts have agreed that .50-caliber weapons aimed at a plane while \nstationary, or taking off or arriving, could be just as disastrous as a \nhit from a missile launcher. Gal Luff, Co-Director of the Institute for \nthe Analysis of Global Security, has described .50-caliber weapons as \n``lethal to slow moving planes.''\n  For further illustration of the potential destruction of these \nweapons, simply listen to the manufacturers themselves. According to a \nBarrett Firearms Manufacturing Model 82A1 .50-caliber sniper rifle \nbrochure: ``The cost effectiveness of the Model 82A1 cannot be \noveremphasized when a round of ammunition purchased for less than ten \nU.S. dollars can be used to destroy or disable a modern jet aircraft. \nThe compressor sections of jet engines or the transmissions of \nhelicopters are likely targets for the weapon, making it capable of \ndestroying multimillion dollar aircraft with a single hit delivered to \na vital area.''\n  The Nordic Ammunition Company is the developer of the Raufoss \nmultipurpose ammunition for .50-caliber weapons that combines armor-\npiercing, incendiary, and explosive features and was used by U.S. \nforces during the Gulf War. According to the company, the ammunition \ncan ignite military jet fuel and has ``the equivalent firing power of a \n20mm projectile to include such targets as helicopters, aircrafts, \nlight armor vehicles, ships, and light fortifications.''\n  Ammunition for these guns is also readily available in stores and on \nthe Internet. This is perfectly legal. Even those categories which are \nillegal, such as the ``armor piercing incendiary'' ammunition that \nexplodes on impact can, according to a recent ``60 Minutes'' news \nreport, be purchased online.\n  Several ammunition dealers were willing to sell armor piercing \nammunition to an undercover GAO investigator even after the \ninvestigator said he wanted the ammunition to pierce an armored \nlimousine or maybe to shoot down a helicopter.\n  Current law classifies .50-caliber guns as ``long guns,'' subject to \nthe least government regulation for any firearm. In other words, the \nlaw makes no distinction between the .22-caliber target rifle, a .30-06 \ncaliber hunter's weapon, and this large-caliber combat weapon. Simply, \nI believe the law is wrong and needs to be changed.\n  This weapon is not in the same class as other rifles. Its power and \nrange are of an order of magnitude higher.\n  Sawed-off shotguns, machine guns, and even handguns are more highly-\nregulated than this military sniper rifle. In fact, many States allow \npossession of .50-caliber guns by those as young as 14-years old, and \nthere is no regulation on second-hand sales.\n  Just this past year, the RAND Corporation released a report which \nidentified eleven potential terrorist scenarios at Los Angeles \nInternational Airport. In one scenario, ``a sniper, using a .50 caliber \nrifle, fires at parked and taxiing aircraft.'' The report concludes: \n``we were unable to identify any truly satisfactory solutions'' for \nsuch an attack.\n  Last June, a Department of Homeland Security representative told the \nDallas Morning News that ``we remain concerned about any weapon of \nchoice that could potentially be used by a terrorist, including a .50-\ncaliber rifle.'' I think the Department's concerns are well founded.\n  The bottom line is that the .50-caliber sniper weapon represents a \nnational security threat requiring action by Congress.\n  This is a weapon which should not be available to terrorists and \ncriminals, and should be responsibly controlled through carefully \ncrafted regulation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 935\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S4553]]\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Fifty Caliber Sniper Weapons \n     Regulation Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Certain firearms originally designed and built for use \n     as long-range .50 caliber military sniper weapons are \n     increasingly being sold in the United States civilian market.\n       (2) The intended use of these long-range firearms, and an \n     increasing number of models derived directly from them, is \n     the taking of human life and the destruction of materiel, \n     including armored vehicles and components of the national \n     critical infrastructure, such as radar and microwave \n     transmission devices.\n       (3) These firearms are neither designed nor used in any \n     significant number for legitimate sporting or hunting \n     purposes and are clearly distinguishable from rifles intended \n     for sporting and hunting use.\n       (4) Extraordinarily destructive ammunition for these \n     weapons, including armor-piercing and armor-piercing \n     incendiary ammunition, is freely sold in interstate commerce.\n       (5) The virtually unrestricted availability of these \n     firearms and ammunition, given the uses intended in their \n     design and manufacture, present a serious and substantial \n     threat to the national security.\n\n     SEC. 3. COVERAGE OF .50 CALIBER SNIPER WEAPONS UNDER THE \n                   NATIONAL FIREARMS ACT.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 5845(a) of the Internal Revenue \n     Code of 1986 (defining firearm) is amended by striking ``(6) \n     a machine gun; (7) any silencer (as defined in section 921 of \n     title 18, United States Code); and (8) a destructive \n     device.'' and inserting ``(6) a .50 caliber sniper weapon; \n     (7) a machine gun; (8) any silencer (as defined in section \n     921 of title 18, United States Code); and (9) a destructive \n     device.''.\n       (b) Definitions.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 5845 the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986 (defining terms relating to firearms) is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n       ``(n) Fifty Caliber Sniper Weapon.--The term `.50 caliber \n     sniper weapon' means a rifle capable of firing a center-fire \n     cartridge in .50 caliber, .50 BMG caliber, any other variant \n     of .50 caliber, or any metric equivalent of such calibers.''.\n       (2) Modification to definition of rifle.--Section 5845(c) \n     of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (defining rifle) is \n     amended by inserting ``or from a bipod or other support'' \n     after ``shoulder''.\n\n     SEC. 4. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       The amendments made by this Act shall only apply to a .50 \n     caliber sniper weapon made or transferred after the date of \n     enactment of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself and Mr. Sununu):\n  S. 936. A bill to ensure privacy for e-mail communications; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I introduce today the Leahy-Sununu E-mail \nPrivacy Act to ensure that last year's decision by the First Circuit \nCourt of Appeals in a case called United States v. Councilman does not \nundermine the online privacy that Americans expect and cherish. Senator \nSununu has been a leader on privacy issues, and I appreciate and \nwelcome his support.\n  In a strained reading of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act \n(ECPA), the majority in this case effectively concluded that it was \npermissible for an Internet Service Provider to systematically \nintercept, copy and read its customers' incoming e-mails for corporate \ngain. This outcome is an unacceptable privacy intrusion that is \ninconsistent with Congressional intent and the commonly-held \nunderstanding of the protections provided by ECPA, and requires swift \nCongressional response. I offer the E-mail Privacy Act as a simple, \nstraightforward way to prevent the erosion of the privacy protection \nCongress granted to e-mail and ensure that this outcome is not \nrepeated.\n  In 1986 Congress passed ECPA to update the Wiretap Act so that \nAmericans could enjoy the same amount of privacy in their online \ncommunications as they do in the offline world. ECPA was a careful, \nbipartisan and long-planned effort to protect electronic communications \nin two forms--from real-time monitoring or interception as they were \nbeing delivered, and from searches when they were stored in record \nsystems. We recognized these as different functions and set rules for \neach based on the relevant privacy expectations and threats to privacy \nimplicated by the different forms of surveillance.\n  The Councilman decision upset this careful distinction. Functionally, \nthe ISP was intercepting e-mails as they were being delivered, yet the \nmajority concluded that the relevant rules were those pertaining to \nstored communications, which exempt ISPs. Specifically, the majority \nrejected the argument put forth by the Justice Department that an \nintercept occurs--and the Wiretap Act--applies when an e-mail is \nacquired contemporaneously with its transmission, regardless of whether \nthe transmission may be in electronic storage for a nanosecond at the \ntime of acquisition. This majority's conclusion fails to consider the \nnature of electronic communications systems and belies the reality that \nsuch searches are functionally an interception.\n  The implications of this decision are broad. While many ISPs are \nresponsible online citizens, this does not change the fact that this \ndecision essentially licenses ISPs to snoop. Even more worrisome is \nthat this decision creates the opportunity for the type of Big Brother \ninvasions that understandably make Americans cringe. For practical \nreasons, law enforcement often installs surveillance devices at these \nnanosecond storage points, but before doing so, they have obtained the \nappropriate legal permission to intercept e-mails--a Title III order. \nUnder the majority's interpretation in the Councilman decision, law \nenforcement would no longer need to obtain a Title III order to conduct \nsuch searches, but rather could follow the less rigorous procedures for \nstored communications. For example, under the rules for stored \ncommunication, if law enforcement were to get the consent of a \nuniversity-operated ISP, such searches could be performed without the \nknowledge of users. This is Carnivore unleashed if you will, and is \nsimply not the outcome that Congress intended or the American people \nexpect. Searches that occur in nanosecond storage points during the \ntransmission process are in their function ``interceptions'' and should \nbe treated as such and subject to the wiretap laws.\n  The E-mail Privacy Act is a simple approach to prevent the erosion of \nprivacy protections and clarifies that the wiretap laws apply to e-mail \ninterceptions like those at issue in the Councilman case. In essence, \nthe Act would amend ECPA to clarify that the definition of intercept is \nnot a narrow, rigid concept, but is broad enough to include actions \nthat are functionally equivalent to an interception. Importantly, these \ncareful and slight changes would simply restore the status quo prior to \nthe Councilman decision without disturbing other areas of ECPA and \nwithout raising controversial concerns that may be difficult to resolve \nin the few remaining days of this term.\n  This is an important issue to the American people, and fortunately \nthe E-mail Privacy Act provides a straightforward approach that we can \nall get behind. Again, I thank Senator Sununu for his support on this \nimportant legislation. I am sure he would join me in urging our \ncolleagues to make e-mail privacy a top priority and support the E-mail \nPrivacy Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 936\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``E-Mail Privacy Act of \n     2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. CLARIFICATION OF THE DEFINITION OF INTERCEPT.\n\n       Section 2510(4) of title 18, United States Code, is amended \n     by striking ``through the use of any electronic, mechanical, \n     or other device.'' and inserting ``contemporaneous with \n     transit, or on an ongoing basis during transit, through the \n     use of any electronic, mechanical, or other device or \n     process, notwithstanding that the communication may \n     simultaneously be in electronic storage;''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORNYN (for himself and Mr. Specter):\n  S. 937. A bill to combat commercial sexual activities by targeting \ndemand, to protect children from being exploited by such activities, to \nprohibit the operation of sex tours, to assist State and local \ngovernments to enforce laws dealing with commercial sexual activities, \nto reduce trafficking in persons, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation to combat \nthe scourge of sex trafficking within our\n\n[[Page S4554]]\n\nborders, by targeting and reducing demand. The bill is entitled the End \nDemand for Sex Trafficking Act of 2005.\n  For the last four years, the President has been a stalwart champion \nof strengthening efforts to combat the scourge of human trafficking and \nslavery, not just abroad, but within our very own borders as well. Last \nJuly, a Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing I chaired, highlighted \nmany of the Administration's landmark efforts in this area to date.\n  Most Americans would be shocked to learn that the institutions of \nslavery and involuntary servitude--institutions that this Nation fought \na bloody war to destroy--continue to persist today--not just around the \nworld, but hidden in communities across America. It has been nearly two \ncenturies since the abolition of the transatlantic slave trade, and \nwell over a century since the ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment. \nYet to this day, men, women and children continue to be trafficked into \nthe United States, and coerced into lives of forced labor and sexual \nslavery. The stories they tell are tragic, disturbing, and heart-\nrending. And the acts they endure are not just unconstitutional, not \njust criminal--they are profoundly evil, immoral, and wrong.\n  Shortly after the Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing I chaired, \nthe President made clear that ending the demand for trafficking is a \ncritical component of this effort, in remarks he delivered before the \nfirst national training conference on Human Trafficking in the United \nStates: Rescuing Women and Children from Slavery, hosted by the Justice \nDepartment in Tampa, Florida, and attended by a representative from my \noffice. As the President stated, ``we cannot put [human traffickers] \nout of business until and unless we deal with the problem of demand.''\n  Moreover, as the State Department's 2004 Trafficking in Persons \nReport notes, ``[c]onsiderable academic, NGO, and scientific research \nconfirms a direct link between prostitution and trafficking. In fact, \nprostitution and its related activities . . . contribute[] to \ntrafficking in persons by serving as a front behind which traffickers \nfor sexual exploitation operate. . . . [P]rostitution directly \ncontributes to the modern-day slave trade and is inherently demeaning. \nWhen law enforcement tolerates . . . prostitution, organized crime \ngroups are freer to traffic in human beings.''\n  So it is appropriate to expand our fight against the most coercive \nforms of human trafficking and slavery our society has ever witnessed, \nto include an effort to combat sex trafficking and prostitution as \nwell. And it is appropriate to target the demand for sex trafficking as \nan essential element of our strategy to eliminating sex trafficking \nwithin our borders.\n  Accordingly, for the past several months, I have been working with \nvarious anti-trafficking organizations to craft legislation to focus \nattention on the demand for sex trafficking within our own country. \nLast October, Senators Schumer and Specter and I introduced an earlier \nversion of the legislation I introduce today (S. 2916). Representatives \nPryce and Maloney introduced a companion bill on the House side that \nsame day. And today, I am introducing a revised version of the bill, \ndesigned to achieve precisely the same objective: ending demand for sex \ntrafficking. I am pleased that Senator Specter has again agreed to co-\nsponsor the legislation. Moreover, Senator Schumer remains a close \npartner on this bill. Our offices are still working out some drafting \nissues with some of the anti-trafficking groups, and I am hopeful that \nSenator Schumer will once again be the lead Democrat co-sponsor of the \nbill. A parallel bill will be introduced in the House later today by \nRepresentatives Deborah Pryce, Carolyn Maloney, and Bobby Scott.\n  This legislation is the product of extensive discussions over the \nlast several months between my office, Senator Schumer's office, and \nmajor anti-trafficking organizations, as well as the offices of \nRepresentatives Pryce and Scott. I am pleased to report that, as a \nresult of those discussions, we now have a bill that is supported by a \nbroad coalition of anti-trafficking and human rights organizations--\nincluding the Ministerial Alliance of Midland, Texas, Faces of \nChildren, the Coalition Against Trafficking in Women, Concerned Women \nfor America, the Hudson Institute, the Institute on Religion and \nDemocracy, the Institute on Religion and Public Policy, the Leadership \nCouncil for Human Rights, the National Association of Evangelicals, the \nPolaris Project, the Protection Project, the Religious Freedom \nCoalition, the Salvation Army, Shared Hope International, the Southern \nBaptist Convention, Standing Against Global Exploitation (SAGE), the \nUnion of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America, World Vision, and \nother organizations and advocates. I ask unanimous consent that letters \nof endorsement from various anti-trafficking organizations be included \nin the Record.\n  In conclusion, this is important legislation to protect the victims \nof sex trafficking and to reduce demand. I hope that the Senate will \nact favorably on the bill.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                  Southern Baptist Convention,\n\n                                    Nashville, TN, March 11, 2005.\n     Mr. James Ho,\n     Chief Counsel, Subcommittee on Border Security, Immigration \n         and Citizenship, Dirksen Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Mr. Derek Lindblom,\n     Counsel, Office of Senator Chuck Schumer, Hart Senate \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n     Ms. Shiloh Roehl,\n     Legislative Director, Office of Congresswoman Deborah Pryce, \n         Cannon House Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Mr. Bobby Vasssar,\n     Minority Counsel, House Committee on the Judiciary, Rayburn \n         House Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Jim, Derek, Shiloh, and Bobby: I am pleased to notify \n     you that the following members and organizations of the \n     National Coalition for Religious Freedom and Human Rights \n     fully support the End Demand for Sex Trafficking Act of 2005, \n     including myself.

Reducing demand for \n     commercial sex will help reduce the number of trafficking \n     victims and help prevent the sexual exploitation of women and \n     children.\n       I commend you for commitment to helping end sex trafficking \n     and your commitment to human rights.\n\n[[Page S4555]]\n\n       Thank you.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                  Linda Smith,\n\n                                   Founder and Executive Director,\n     Shared Hope International.\n                                  ____\n\n                                             Institute on Religion\n\n\n                                            and Public Policy,\n\n                                  Washington, DC., March 15, 2005.\n     Hon. John Cornyn,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cornyn: I am writing in support of the End \n     Demand for Sex Trafficking Act of 2005. This historic \n     legislation would bring significant attention to the true \n     roots of sexual trafficking: the demand for illegal sexual \n     activity. It would also combat the commercial sexual trade by \n     focusing law enforcement effort on consumers, traffickers, \n     and exploiters, ending the current isolation of the \n     individuals exploited in the illegal activity.\n       The End Demand for Sexual Trafficking Act of 2005 is the \n     result of many hours of work by lawmakers, religious leaders, \n     and NGOs under your ledership and is a much-needed addition \n     to the United States' sexual trafficking laws. This bill will \n     hopefully focus the attention of sexual trafficking \n     prosecution on the traffickers and the ``johns'' who pay for \n     the illegal activities, thereby solidifying America's \n     position as the world leader in working to end sexual \n     trafficking and prostitution.\n       With warm personal regards and best wishes, I am,\n           Sincerely Yours,\n                                              Joseph K.

We \n     support H.R. 972, the Trafficking Victims Protection \n     Reauthorization Act of 2005 and the introduction of the End \n     Demand for Sex Trafficking Act of 2005. The combined \n     strengths of these two bills provide for effective measures \n     to help combat sex trafficking by increasing law enforcement \n     efforts, reducing demand and increasing services available to \n     victims.\n       An estimated two million children currently are enslaved in \n     the global commercial sex trade, which has destroyed the \n     lives of countless women and children throughout history. For \n     children, the most vulnerable victims, the impact is \n     catastrophic, including: long-lasting physical and \n     psychological trauma, disease (including HIV/AIDS), violence/\n     abuse, drug addiction, unwanted pregnancy, malnutrition, \n     social ostracism, a life of poverty and, in the worst cases, \n     death. Notably, this abhorrent abuse is found in nearly every \n     country, including the United States.\n       The provisions included in the End Demand for Sex \n     Trafficking Act of 2005 will help remedy this problem by \n     increasing U.S. law enforcement action against the abusers, \n     including traffickers, pimps, brothel owners and \n     ``customers'' (a.k.a., ``Johns''), thereby curtailing demand. \n     In addition, the Trafficking Victims Protection \n     Reauthorization Act of 2005 reauthorizes much-needed program \n     funds, provides for increased law enforcement programs and \n     tools and bolsters the TIP office at the Department of State. \n     Both bills measurably increase services available to victims.\n       World Vision is delighted to support both of these bills \n     and we have full confidence in the U.S. Congress to resolve \n     any differences between the two bills in order to arrive at \n     the most effective legislation possible.

Through advocacy, educational \n     programs, and as a direct service provider for over 14 years, \n     SAGE has assisted in raising public awareness concerning the \n     sexual exploitation and trafficking of women and girls. As a \n     result of our interventions, SAGE has assisted over 1500 \n     individuals to exit the criminal justice system, escape \n     traffickers and actively engage in prosecutions, receive \n     emergency housing and victim services, recover from abuse and \n     acquire appropriate services such as medical and mental \n     health care, substance abuse treatment, legal, immigration, \n     case management, educational and vocational training. Because \n     of SAGE's commitment to victims of exploitation and \n     trafficking, a web of prevention education, early \n     intervention and treatment services and a network of \n     survivor, peer led programs throughout the United States has \n     been created. SAGE is the co-founder of the first and largest \n     program for customers of prostitutes in the world. This \n     restorative justice program has been replicated in dozens of \n     other cities and funds a wide range of services for women and \n     girls.\n       Studies show that most commercially sexually exploited \n     children (CSEC) are integrated into the mainstream sex \n     industry and tend to be concentrated in the cheaper end of \n     the prostitution market where conditions are the worse and \n     the concentration of customers/abusers the highest. Although \n     some children are prostituted by and/or specifically for \n     pedophiles and preferential abusers, the majority of the \n     several million men who annually exploit children are first \n     and foremost prostitute users of adult women who become child \n     sexual abusers through their prostitute use, rather than the \n     other way around. The world of prostitution whether legal or \n     illegal provides an arena where laws and rules which \n     constrain sex with minors can be evaded. Laws and social \n     conventions make it difficult and dangerous for individuals \n     to buy children for sexual purposes in non-commercial \n     contexts, but prostitution potentially provides instant \n     access, often to a selection of children. Men surveyed in San \n     Francisco through SAGE and the First Offenders Prostitution \n     Program respond when asked how a person justifies having sex \n     with an underage prostituted child, ''they don't even \n     think.'' They know that law enforcement efforts are focused \n     on the youth/child as the perpetrator and not on them. The \n     End Demand for Sex Trafficking Act of 2005 is the most \n     historically significant step toward ending the rape and \n     sexual abuse of children through prostitution and holding the \n     true perpetrators accountable.\n       The End Demand for Sex Trafficking Act of 2005 clearly, \n     strongly, and unambiguously redefines ``child prostitution'' \n     as sexual abuse on young human beings. This sexual abuse of \n     children through prostitution is made possible by a society \n     that has sanctioned and institutionalized numbers of children \n     for whom routine abuse, torture, rape, trafficking and \n     kidnapping is considered acceptable. In essence, what society \n     is saying and enforcing through laws and inappropriate \n     interventions is that children and\n\n[[Page S4556]]\n\n     youth are consenting to their own sexual abuse and that by \n     consenting to this abuse they are a danger to society. They \n     are subject to arrest, they are viewed as perpetrators, not \n     victims, and they are denied any services for their \n     victimization. Many of these girls have been exploited for \n     pornography or have suffered or witnessed physical and sexual \n     violence. For these girls, the average of entry into \n     prostitution is 13-14, an age at which these girls are \n     entering an endless cycle of arrest, drug addiction, and \n     violence. The result is traumatic and profound lack of self-\n     esteem causing disempowered behaviors: dropping out of \n     school, prostitution, addiction, selling of drugs, and \n     violence. Their exploitation is perpetuated by continued \n     reliance on the very people who have physically, emotionally, \n     and sexually assaulted them. As these children age into \n     adults they remain trapped in a system of abuse and \n     exploitation and could not escape even if they wanted to. The \n     legal, mental and medical health, human rights consequences \n     of this abuse remains with the child or woman as she is \n     arrested, prosecuted, jailed, placed on probation and forced \n     into treatment. The End Demand for Sex Trafficking Act of \n     2005 will send the message that now these severely victimized \n     and neglected children and women can depend on us for \n     protection and care.\n       SAGE is committed to working with you and your office in \n     passing this historic legislation.

The Protection Project strongly believes that \n     reducing demand is the most effective way to successfully \n     combat sex trafficking.\n       The End Demand for Sex Trafficking Act of 2005 is a \n     significant step forward in the fight against sex \n     trafficking, since it introduces appropriate measures to \n     promote the prosecution of purchasers of commercial sex acts, \n     exploiters of sexual activities and traffickers. In \n     particular, in regard to the prosecution of purchasers, I \n     strongly endorse Section 4(b)(1), which proposes measures \n     such as educational programs for first time purchasers of \n     ``unlawful commercial sex,'' publication of names and \n     addresses, the use of female decoys, statutory rape and \n     felony assaults prosecutions, and other programs enhancing \n     prosecution and reducing demand. I firmly believe that these \n     measures would significantly contribute to discouraging \n     demand.\n       The Protection Project is committed to working with you and \n     supports the passage of this important legislation.\n           Best Regards,\n\n                                    Mohamed Y.

Murray\n\n       Although progress has been made in many areas since the \n     Trafficking Victims Protection Act was passed in 2000, the \n     tragic human degradation of sexual trafficking continues to \n     increase in magnitude. The number of those adversely affected \n     continues to grow, especially among children, the most \n     pathetic victims.\n       By focusing more on the male customers and on traffickers, \n     this proposed legislation can reduce prostitution by \n     redirecting law enforcement efforts which now \n     disproportionately lead to the arrest of the women involved \n     in prostitution, some of whom are trafficking victims.\n       The legislators who have wisely recognized that \n     prostitution is not a ``victimless crime'' and who have taken \n     steps to reduce its prevalence are to be applauded. It has \n     long been realized that prostitution brutalizes and \n     desensitizes men, who come to view women as objects and not \n     as human beings. A new study has shown that prostitution also \n     leads to more criminal behavior in women, and not just in \n     drug related offenses. It was found that 7 out of 10 women \n     who were convicted of felonies of all kinds, first entered \n     the legal system because of an arrest for prostitution.\n       Sex tourism is a growing industry that targets children in \n     third world countries, and the United States is the home of \n     probably more ``sex tourists'' than any other single nation. \n     The victims are not American children in this case, but are \n     poor and often abandoned children in foreign countries where \n     there is lax law enforcement. This new effort to stop the \n     victimization of these children should be supported in all \n     possible ways. The men who travel abroad to exploit children \n     and the tour operators who are well aware of the nature of \n     the trips they are providing, should be prosecuted.\n       This bipartisan effort by members of the Senate and the \n     House to address this serious humanitarian issue is to be \n     highly commended, and I hope it will gain many more \n     supporters and cosponsors in Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself and Mr. Bond):\n  S. 938. A bill to amend title 37, United States Code, to require that \nmembers of the National Guard and Reserve called or ordered to active \nduty for a period of more than 30 days to receive a basic allowance for \nhousing at the same rate as similarly situated members of the regular \ncomponents of the uniformed services; to the Committee on Armed \nServices.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it is now fairly common on the Senate Floor \nto hear the statement that we cannot adequately defend our Nation today \nwithout our military reserves. Everybody knows that the activation of \nmembers of the National Guard and Reserve since September 11, 2001, \nrepresents the largest mobilization of our back-up military personnel \nsince World War II. Everyone knows too that members of the National \nGuard and Reserve comprise over 50 percent of the forces on the ground \nin Iraq. And, yes, we all know that we are asking the reserves, \nparticularly the National Guard, to help increase security within the \ndomestic United States, whether at prominent events or along our porous \nnational borders.\n  It is critical that we go beyond mere statements and take concrete \nsteps to preserve the readiness, morale, and general effectiveness of \nthis force. This imperative extends particularly to redressing harmful \npolicies that give the impression to our reservists that they are not \nan equally important part of the wider military and the defense of the \nNation.\n  Today Senator Bond and I are introducing legislation that will end \none of the most glaring of these inequities. Our legislation, The \nNational Guard and Reserves Housing Equity Act of 2005, effectively \nterminates a patently unfair low housing allowance provided to \nreservists when they are called up for a relatively short-term of \nactive service.\n  This so-called lower allowance level, known officially as the Basic \nAllowance for Housing II, or B.A.H. II, puts on average almost $400 \nless per month--per month--in the pockets of our reservists than what \nthey would receive if they were regular, active duty members. To any \nreservist who leaves his or her community, profession, and family for \nactive service, receiving B.A.H. II says that he or she is a second-\nclass member of the military. You might do the same job as a full-time \nmember of the military and live in the same type of housing, but you do \nnot deserve the same allowance. The allowance creates an unacceptable \nfinancial hardship that will decrease the willingness of any reasonable \nperson to continue service.\n  This is a very real problem. Last year, Congress and the President \nenacted a piece of legislation--which I\n\n[[Page S4557]]\n\nsponsored along with my fellow Guard Caucus Co-Chair Senator Kit Bond--\nthat authorized greater use of the National Guard for national homeland \nsecurity missions. Using this new authority, members of the National \nGuard from my home State of Vermont were called to active duty late \nlast year to help increase security along the Northern Border. Those \nmembers of the Guard worked side-by-side with their active duty \ncounterparts. Yet the Guard personnel received over $300 less per month \nin housing allowances.\n  I cannot tell you how many soldiers and airmen who participated in \nthat mission came up to me and made clear how slighted and insulted \nthey felt by that housing allowance. Those comments mirror what I heard \nfrom other members of the Guard who received B.A.H. II on a similar \nmission. This second-tier housing allowance really burns in the saddle \nof every citizen-soldier, sailor, airman, and marine, and it is having \na real effect on morale.\n  We simply cannot tolerate this inequity to continue, and it is within \nour power to do something about this. So we have a choice today: Either \nwe can keep this second-tier housing allowance in place and send a \nsignal that we need to save some dollars on the backs of those who have \nstepped forward to serve, or we can remedy this inequity, making the \nfirm statement that we will take the real steps necessary to support \nour reservists and provide them the resources so that they can do their \njobs and be treated fairly while they serve.\n  The National Guard and Reserves Housing Equity Act of 2005 \nspecifically provides that any member of the reserves called up for \nmore than 30 days will receive the exact same housing allowance as a \nregular active duty service-member. The legislation gives the Office of \nSecretary of Defense some discretion to set the allowance under the 30 \ndays, but it should be done on a pro-rated basis on the higher regular \nallowance. The effect of this legislation will be to end the category \nof Basic Allowance of Housing II.\n  This legislation has been endorsed unanimously by the 35-military \nassociation umbrella group, The Military Coalition. So that all \nsenators may read the specific views of the military associations, I \nask that letters from the National Guard Association of the United \nStates, the Enlisted Association of the National Guard of the United \nStates, the Reserve Officers Associations, the Reserve Enlisted \nAssociation, the Association of the United States Army, and the Fleet \nReserve Association be printed in the Record. The Military Officer's \nAssociation of America and the Air Force Sergeant's Association have \nalso directly endorsed this legislation.\n  We often hear statements about supporting our troops, but this is a \nchance to actually support them. This is an issue that literally \naffects our troops where they live. I invite our colleagues to join \nSenator Bond and me in co-sponsoring this legislation and in working to \nend this grossly unfair system. With the National Guard and Reserves \nHousing Equity Act of 2005, we are backing up our thanks with \nmeaningful action. With this step we are saying that we are ready to \nprovide a strong foundation of policies that will actually encourage \nour reservists to continue to serve the country superbly. This is the \nright thing to do, and I look forward to working with my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle to enacting this legislation this year.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                        National Guard Association\n\n\n                                         of the United States,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 26, 2005.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: I am writing on behalf of the men and \n     women of the National Guard Association of the United States \n     to thank you for introducing legislation which addresses the \n     inequities in housing allowances paid to members of the \n     National Guard.\n       Your bill, which reduces the threshold for receipt of full \n     BAH from 140 days to 30 days, will have an immediate and \n     positive impact on many of our members who are receiving \n     housing allowances at a rate which is on average $400 less \n     than the regular BAR rate. Because BAH II is not adjusted for \n     location, in some places the loss of income could be as high \n     as $1,000.00, depending on rank.\n       As you know, when a Guard member is on duty, the mortgage \n     payment or rent is not reduced. Your bill will rectify this \n     injustice and allow National Guard members to receive full \n     BAH when on orders for more than 30 days.\n       At no other time in recent history have the men and women \n     of the National Guard been asked to sacrifice so much for the \n     good of the Nation. We thank you for recognizing their \n     contribution and sacrifice and working to remove this \n     inequity in their housing allowance.\n       Please don't hesitate to call on us if there is anything we \n     else we can do to support this worthwhile legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Stephen M.

Patrick Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: On behalf of the Enlisted men and women \n     of the Army and Air National Guard, thank you for introducing \n     legislation to reduce the threshold for the receipt of Basic \n     Allowance for Housing (BAH) to 30 days. This bill will \n     authorize National Guard and Reserve members on active duty \n     for more than 30 days to receive full BAH instead of the \n     lower BAH II they now receive if their orders are for less \n     than 140 days.\n       Almost all National Guard members must maintain a private \n     residence while performing periods of active duty. Their rent \n     or mortgage payment doesn't go away when they are called to \n     active duty.\n       National Guard and Reserve members who are on active duty \n     for less than 140 days receive BAH II instead of the BAH that \n     every other servicemembers receives. BAH II is based on the \n     old BAQ rate and is, on average, $400 less than the average \n     BAH rate. it is not adjusted for location. In some places, \n     such as the Washington, DC Metro area, the difference can be \n     $1,000, depending upon the rank of the servicemember.\n       A significant percentage of mobilized Guard members earn \n     less on active duty than in their civilian careers and paying \n     them a reduced housing allowance only makes the financial \n     difficulty worse. Your bill would eliminate this inequity for \n     most National Guard and Reserve members by changing the \n     threshold from 140 days to 30 days.\n       Thank you so much for addressing one of the many needs of \n     our National Guard members. EANGUS will support this \n     legislation in any way possible. If there is anything we can \n     do to assist, please let us know.\n           Working for America's Best!\n                                   MSG (Ret) Michael P.

The lower Reserve Component housing \n     allowance has been reported by ROA members as a reason why \n     they are not encouraged to volunteer for active duty.\n       Additionally, it will also help to offset pay differential \n     and positively affect the financial health of our military \n     families. The provisions of your bill meet sound business \n     practices by targeting entitlements and we are encouraged it \n     will receive bipartisan interest.

Patrick J.

This measure significantly helps ensure \n     Reservists' compensation reflects the duties our Nation has \n     asked them to perform.\n       The Association salutes you for your efforts and is \n     committed to working toward enactment of this important \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Joseph L.

A bill to amend the Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act of \n1978 to establish a program to provide assistance to States and \nnonprofit organizations to preserve suburban forest land and open space \nand contain suburban sprawl; to the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the people of Maine have always been \nfaithful stewards of the forest because we understand its tremendous \nvalue to our economy and to our way of life. From the vast tracts of \nundeveloped land in the north to the small woodlots in the south, \nforest land helps shape the character of our entire State.\n  While our commitment to stewardship has preserved the forest for \ngenerations, there is a threat to Maine's working landscape that \nrequires a fresh approach. This threat is suburban sprawl, which has \nalready consumed tens of thousands of acres of forest land in southern \nMaine. Sprawl occurs because the economic value of forest or farm land \ncannot compete with the value of developed land.\n  Sprawl threatens our environment and our quality of life. It destroys \necosystems, increasing the risk of flooding and other environmental \nhazards. It burdens the infrastructure of the affected communities, \nincreases traffic on neighborhood streets, and wastes taxpayer money. \nIt leads to the fragmentation of woodlots, reducing the economic \nviability of the remaining working forests.\n  No State is immune from the dangers of sprawl. For example, the \nVirginia State Forester says that since 1992, Virginia has lost 54,000 \nacres of forest land per year to other uses.\n  The Southeastern Michigan Council of Government reported that \nsoutheastern Michigan saw a 17 percent increase in developed land \nbetween 1990 and 2000.\n  In my State of Maine alone, suburban sprawl has already consumed tens \nof thousands of acres of forest and farm land. The problem is \nparticularly acute in southern Maine where an 108 percent increase in \nurbanized land over the past two decades has resulted in the labeling \nof greater Portland as the ``sprawl capital of the Northeast.''\n  I am particularly alarmed by the amount of working forest and farm \nland and open space in southern and coastal Maine that have given way \nto strip malls and cul-de-sacs. Once these forests, farms, and meadows \nare lost to development, they are lost forever.\n  Maine is trying to respond to this challenge. The people of Maine \ncontinue to contribute their time and money to preserve important lands \nand to support our State's 88 land trusts. It is time for the Federal \nGovernment to support these State and community-based efforts.\n  For these reasons, I am introducing the Suburban and Community \nForestry and Open Space Program Act. This legislation, which was \ndrafted with the advice of land owners and conservation groups, \nestablishes a $50 million grant program within the U.S. Forest Service \nto support locally driven land conservation projects that preserve \nworking forests. Local government and nonprofit organizations could \ncompete for funds to purchase land or access to land to protect working \nlandscapes threatened by development.\n  Projects funded under this initiative must be targeted at lands \nlocated in parts of the country that are threatened by sprawl. In \naddition, this legislation requires that Federal grant funds be matched \ndollar-for-dollar by state, local, or private resources.\n  This is a market-driven program that relies upon market forces rather \nthan government regulations to achieve its objectives. Rather than \npreserving our working forests, farmland and open spaces by zoning or \nother government regulation, at the expense of the landowner, with this \nprogram we will provide the resources to allow a landowner who wishes \nto keep his or her land as a working woodlot to do so.\n  My legislation also protects the rights of property owners with the \ninclusion of a ``willing-seller'' provision, which requires the consent \nof a landowner if a parcel of land is to participate in the program.\n  The $50 million that would be authorized by my bill would help \nachieve a number of stewardship objectives: First, this bill would help \nprevent forest fragmentation and preserve working forests, helping to \nmaintain the supply of timber that fuels Maine's most significant \nindustry.\n  Second, these resources would be a valuable tool for communities that \nare struggling to manage growth and prevent sprawl.\n  Understanding land ownership issues in other parts of the nation, I \nhave included a geographic limitation in this bill. This limitation \nwould exempt any state where the Federal Government owns twenty-five \npercent or more of that State's land from the Suburban and Community \nForestry and Open Space Program. With the twenty-five percent \nlimitation, a figure used in previous bills, the twelve States with the \nhighest percentage of federally owned land would not be eligible to \nparticipate in this new program. Those States, however, who are \nstruggling most with the loss of working landscapes would be authorized \nto receive Federal assistance in their efforts to combat sprawl.\n  Currently, if the town of Gorham, ME, or another community trying to \ncope with the effects of sprawl turned to the Federal Government for \nassistance, none would be found. My bill will change that by making the \nFederal Government an active partner in preserving forest and farm land \nand managing sprawl, while leaving decision-making at the state and \nlocal level where it belongs.\n  In 2002, this legislation was included in the forestry title of the \nSenate approved version of the Farm Bill. Unfortunately, the forestry \ntitle was stripped out of the Farm Bill conference report. Again, in \n2003, this legislation passed the Senate. This time, during \nconsideration of the Healthy Forests Restoration Act.\n  Unfortunately, this provision was removed from the Healthy Forests \nRestoration Act conference report. This new Congress provides us a \nfurther opportunity to consider this legislation and ultimately have \nthis bill enacted.\n  There is great working being done on the local level to protect \nworking landscapes for the next generation. By enacting the Suburban \nand Community Forestry and Open Space Act, Congress can provide an \nadditional avenue of support for these conservation initiatives, help \nprevent sprawl, and help sustain the vitality of natural resource-based \nindustries.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WARNER:\n\n[[Page S4559]]\n\n  S. 942. A bill to designate additional National Forest System lands \nin the State of Virginia as wilderness, to establish the Seng Mountain \nand Bear Creek Scenic Areas, to provide for the development of trail \nplans for the wilderness areas and scenic areas, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce an important \npiece of legislation for my State, the Virginia Ridge and Valley Act of \n2005. This bill will add seven new wilderness areas, six additions to \nexisting wilderness areas, and two National Scenic Areas to the \nJefferson National Forest. Congressman Rick Boucher is introducing \ncompanion legislation in the United States House of Representatives.\n  Throughout my career in the United States Senate, I have strived to \npreserve Virginia's natural resources and heritage through the \ndesignation of wilderness areas and, today, I am proud to say that \nVirginia boasts approximately 100,434 acres of designated wilderness \nlands. However, there is still much work to be done. Within the \nJefferson National Forest, designated wilderness areas currently \naccount for only 7 percent of the total forest acreage. If enacted, the \nVirginia Ridge and Valley Act of 2005 will substantially increase this \nfigure by expanding our opportunities for uninterrupted enjoyment in \nthe forest with the addition of nearly 43,000 acres of new wilderness \nareas and almost 12,000 acres of national scenic areas.\n  Virginia is blessed with great beauty and natural diversity. From the \ncomplex ecosystem of the Chesapeake Bay, to the exquisite vistas, \nstreams, vegetation, and wildlife of the Shenandoah Mountains, \nresidents and visitors alike can enjoy a bountiful array of natural \ntreasures. As demand for development in Virginia increases, it becomes \nincumbent upon Congress to act expeditiously to protect these wild \nlands. Through wilderness and national scenic area designations, we can \nensure that these areas retain their primeval character and influences.\n  Mr. President, I consider myself an avid outdoorsman, and I enjoy \nopportunities for recreation like most Americans. Therefore, I want to \nstress the many joyful outdoor activities that will be enhanced by the \nwilderness designation in these areas, including: hunting, fishing, \nhiking, camping, canoeing, and horseback riding, to name a few. In \naddition, the Act is flexible and provides for reasonable local forest \nmanagement and emergency services in wilderness areas, such as the use \nof motorized equipment and aircraft for search and rescue operations; \nor to combat fire, insects and disease.\n  I am particularly pleased to include in the legislation an \nauthorization for the establishment of a non-motorized trail between \nCounty Route 650 and Forest Development Road 4018 outside of the new \nRaccoon Branch Wilderness area. This trail will follow the historic Rye \nValley Railroad Grade and will be a popular route for mountain bikers, \nequestrians and hikers. In addition, this bill directs the Forest \nService to develop trail plans for the wilderness and national scenic \nareas.\n  As a father and a grandfather, I feel a weighty obligation to ensure \nthat our children have lasting opportunities to enjoy Virginia's \nimmense natural beauty and diversity. This legislation is a crucial \nstep in our quest to preserve these lovely areas for the enjoyment and \nuse of future generations.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Martinez, Mr. \n        Sarbanes, and Mr. Kohl):\n  S. 943. A bill to assist in the conservation of cranes by supporting \nand providing, through projects of persons and organizations with \nexpertise in crane conservation, financial resources for the \nconservation programs of countries the activities of which directly or \nindirectly affect cranes and the ecosystems of cranes; to the Committee \non Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am introducing the Crane Conservation \nAct of 2005. I am very pleased that the Senators from Idaho, Mr. Crapo, \nFlorida, Mr. Martinez, Wisconsin, Mr. Kohl and Maryland, Mr. Sarbanes, \nhave joined me as cosponsors of this bill. I propose this legislation \nin the hope that Congress will do its part to protect the existence of \nthese birds, whose cultural significance and popular appeal can be seen \nworldwide. This legislation is particularly important to the people of \nWisconsin, as our State provides habitat and refuge to several crane \nspecies. But this legislation, which authorizes the United States Fish \nand Wildlife Service to distribute funds and grants to crane \nconservation efforts both domestically and in developing countries, \npromises to have a larger environmental and cultural impact that will \ngo far beyond the boundaries of my home state. This bill is similar to \nlegislation that I introduced in the 107th and 108th Congresses.\n  In October of 1994, Congress passed and the President signed the \nRhinoceros and Tiger Conservation Act. The passage of this act provided \nsupport for multinational rhino and tiger conservation through the \ncreation of the Rhinoceros and Tiger Conservation Fund, or RTCF. \nAdministered by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, the RTCF \ndistributes up to $10 million in grants every year to conservation \ngroups to support projects in developing countries. Since its \nestablishment in 1994, the RTCF has been expanded by Congress to cover \nother species, such as elephants and great apes.\n  Today, with the legislation I am introducing, I am asking Congress to \nadd cranes to this list. Cranes are the most endangered family of birds \nin the world, with 11 of the world's fifteen species at risk of \nextinction. Specifically, this legislation would authorize up to $5 \nmillion of funds per year to be distributed in the form of conservation \nproject grants to protect cranes and their habitat. The financial \nresources authorized by this bill can be made available to qualifying \nconservation groups operating in Asia, Africa, and North America. The \nprogram is authorized from Fiscal Year 2006 through Fiscal Year 2010.\n  In keeping with my belief that we should balance the budget, this \nbill proposes that the $25 million in authorized spending over five \nyears for the Crane Conservation Act established in this legislation \nshould be offset through the Secretary of Interior's administrative \nbudget.\n  I am offering this legislation due to the serious and significant \ndecline that can be expected in crane populations worldwide without \nfurther conservation efforts. Those efforts have achieved some success \nin the case of the North American whooping crane, the rarest crane on \nearth. In 1941, only 21 whooping cranes existed in the entire world. \nThis stands in contrast to the over 450 birds in existence today. The \nNorth American whooping crane's resurgence is attributed to the birds' \ntenacity for survival and to the efforts of conservationists in the \nUnited States and Canada. Today, the only wild flock of North American \nwhooping cranes breeds in northwest Canada, and spends its winters in \ncoastal Texas. Two new flocks of cranes are currently being \nreintroduced to the wild, one of which is a migratory flock on the \nWisconsin to Florida flyway.\n  The movement of this flock of birds shows how any effort by Congress \nto regulate crane conservation needs to cross both national and \ninternational lines. As this flock of birds makes its journey from \nWisconsin to Florida, the birds rely on the ecosystems of a multitude \nof states in this country. In its journey from the Necedah National \nWildlife Refuge in Wisconsin to the Chassahowitzka National Wildlife \nRefuge in Florida in the fall and eventual return to my home state in \nthe spring, this flock also faces threats from pollution of traditional \nwatering grounds, collision with utility lines, human disturbance, \ndisease, predation, loss of genetic diversity within the population, \nand vulnerability to catastrophes, both natural and man-made.\n  The birds also rely on private landowners, the vast majority of whom \nhave enthusiastically welcomed the birds to their rest on their land. \nThrough its extensive outreach and education program, the Whooping \nCrane Eastern Partnership has obtained the consistent support of \nfarmers and other private landowners to make this important recovery \nprogram a success. On every front, this partnership is unique. One of \nthe program's supporters has told me that this program is the \nconservation equivalent of putting a man on the moon. I think it is \nquite appropriate then that the Smithsonian announced that one of the\n\n[[Page S4560]]\n\nultralight planes from Operation Migration, which leads the migration \nfrom Necedah to Chassahowitzka, will be inducted into the National Air \nand Space Museum. The plane will be on display in the Museum early next \nyear. I cannot think of a better way to showcase this innovative \nconservation program.\n  Despite the remarkable conservation efforts taken since 1941, \nhowever, this species is still very much in danger of extinction. While \nover the course of the last half-century, North American whooping \ncranes have begun to make a slow recovery, many species of crane in \nAfrica and Asia have declined, including the sarus crane of Asia and \nthe wattled crane of Africa.\n  The sarus crane stands four feet tall and can be found in the \nwetlands of northern India and south Asia. These birds require large, \nopen, well watered plains or marshes to breed and survive. Due to \nagricultural expansion, industrial development, river basin \ndevelopment, pollution, warfare, and heavy use of pesticides prevalent \nin India and southeast Asia, the sarus crane population has been in \ndecline. Furthermore, in many areas, a high human population \nconcentration compounds these factors. On the Mekong River, which runs \nthrough Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos, Thailand, and China, human population \ngrowth and planned development projects threaten the sarus crane. \nReports from India, Cambodia, and Thailand have also cited incidences \nof the trading of adult birds and chicks, as well as hunting and egg \nstealing in the drop in population of the sarus crane.\n  Only three subspecies of the sarus crane exist today. One resides in \nnorthern India and Nepal, one resides in southeast Asia, and one \nresides in northern Australia. Their population is about 8,000 in the \nmain Indian population, with recent numbers showing a rapid decline. In \nSoutheast Asia, only 1,000 birds remain.\n  The situation of the sarus crane in Asia is mirrored by the situation \nof the wattled crane in Africa. In Africa, the wattled crane is found \nin the southern and eastern regions, with an isolated population in the \nmountains of Ethiopia. Current population estimates range between 6,000 \nto 8,000 and are declining rapidly, due to loss and degradation of \nwetland habitats, as well as intensified agriculture, dam construction, \nand industrialization. In other parts of the range, the creation of \ndams has changed the dynamics of the flood plains, thus further \nendangering these cranes and their habitats. Human disturbance at or \nnear breeding sites also continues to be a major threat. Lack of \noversight and education over the actions of people, industry, and \nagriculture is leading to reduced preservation for the lands on which \ncranes live, thereby threatening the ability of cranes to survive in \nthese regions.\n  If we do not act now, not only will cranes face extinction, but the \necosystems that depend on their contributions will suffer. With the \ndecline of the crane population, the wetlands and marshes they inhabit \ncan potentially be thrown off balance. I urge my colleagues to join me \nin supporting legislation that can provide funding to the local \nfarming, education and enforcement projects that can have the greatest \npositive effect on the preservation of both cranes and fragile \nhabitats. This modest investment can secure the future of these \nexemplary birds and the beautiful areas in which they live. Therefore, \nI ask my colleagues to support the Crane Conservation Act of 2005.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 943\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Crane Conservation Act of \n     2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) crane populations in many countries have experienced \n     serious decline in recent decades, a trend that, if continued \n     at the current rate, threatens the long-term survival of the \n     species in the wild in Africa, Asia, and Europe;\n       (2) 5 species of Asian crane are listed as endangered \n     species under section 4 of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 \n     (16 U.S.C. 1533) and appendix I of the Convention, which \n     species are--\n       (A) the Siberian crane (Grus leucogeranus);\n       (B) the red-crowned crane (Grus japonensis);\n       (C) the white-naped crane (Grus vipio);\n       (D) the black-necked crane (Grus nigricollis); and\n       (E) the hooded crane (Grus monacha);\n       (3) the Crane Action Plan of the International Union for \n     the Conservation of Nature considers 4 species of cranes from \n     Africa and 1 additional species of crane from Asia to be \n     seriously threatened, which species are--\n       (A) the wattled crane (Bugeranus carunculatus);\n       (B) the blue crane (Anthropoides paradisea);\n       (C) the grey-crowned crane (Balearica regulorum);\n       (D) the black-crowned crane (Balearica pavonina); and\n       (E) the sarus crane (Grus antigone);\n       (4)(A) the whooping crane (Grus americana) and the \n     Mississippi sandhill crane (Grus canadensis pulla) are listed \n     as endangered species under section 4 of the Endangered \n     Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1533); and\n       (B) with approximately 200 whooping cranes in the only \n     self-sustaining flock that migrates between Canada and the \n     United States, and approximately 100 Mississippi sandhill \n     cranes in the wild, both species remain vulnerable to \n     extinction;\n       (5) conservation resources have not been sufficient to cope \n     with the continued diminution of crane populations from \n     causes that include hunting and the continued loss of \n     habitat;\n       (6)(A) cranes are flagship species for the conservation of \n     wetland, grassland, and agricultural landscapes that border \n     wetland and grassland; and\n       (B) the establishment of crane conservation programs would \n     result in the provision of conservation benefits to numerous \n     other species of plants and animals, including many \n     endangered species;\n       (7) other threats to cranes include--\n       (A) the collection of eggs and juveniles;\n       (B) poisoning from pesticides applied to crops;\n       (C) collisions with power lines;\n       (D) disturbance from warfare and human settlement; and\n       (E) the trapping of live birds for sale;\n       (8) to reduce, remove, and otherwise effectively address \n     those threats to cranes in the wild, the joint commitment and \n     effort of countries in Africa, Asia, and North America, other \n     countries, and the private sector, are required;\n       (9) cranes are excellent ambassadors to promote goodwill \n     among countries because they are well known and migrate \n     across continents;\n       (10) because the threats facing cranes and the ecosystems \n     on which cranes depend are similar on all 5 continents on \n     which cranes occur, conservation successes and methods \n     developed in 1 region have wide applicability in other \n     regions; and\n       (11) conservationists in the United States have much to \n     teach and much to learn from colleagues working in other \n     countries in which, as in the United States, government and \n     private agencies cooperate to conserve threatened cranes.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to perpetuate healthy populations of cranes;\n       (2) to assist in the conservation and protection of cranes \n     by supporting--\n       (A) conservation programs in countries in which endangered \n     and threatened cranes occur; and\n       (B) the efforts of private organizations committed to \n     helping cranes; and\n       (3) to provide financial resources for those programs and \n     efforts.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Mr. President, today, on Workers' Memorial Day, we \nremember and honor the working men and women here at home who have died \nor been injured on the job in the past year. We also think of their \nfamilies and the losses they have suffered. And we pledge to do more to \nend the unsafe and unhealthy conditions that still plague so many \nworkplaces across America.\n  Thirty-five years have now passed since the enactment of the \nOccupational Safety and Health Act in 1970, and that basic law has made \nan immense difference in the safety of our Nation's workers. The rate \nof fatalities, injuries, and illnesses dropped year after year--a 78 \npercent reduction in the rate of workplace deaths and a 52 percent \nreduction in the rate of workplace-related injuries and illnesses since \nthe law was passed, and the reductions have been even greater in \nindustries that OSHA has targeted in its standards and enforcement \nactivities.\n  But we still have a long way to go. There are still too many workers \nbeing hurt on the job. An average of 15 workers are killed and 12,000 \nmore are injured every single day. That's over 5,500 worker deaths and \n4.4 million worker injuries a year. In Massachusetts, 72 workers died \nfrom traumatic injuries on the job in 2004 and over 600 died from \noccupational disease.\n  These numbers represent real workers and their families. They \nrepresent fathers like Jeff Walters. His son Patrick was killed when a \ntrench in Ohio caved in three years ago--at a company with a history of \nsafety violations. They include people like Ron Hayes, who also lost \nhis son in a workplace accident. Since then, he and his wife Dot have \nmade safety their cause and done a great deal to help families whose \nlives have been hurt by these deaths--including deaths that in many \ncases could, and should have been prevented.\n  Ron and Jeff asked us to prevent this from happening to other \nfamilies. That's why I am introducing this bill--to fight for families \nlike the Walters and the Hayes, and to do everything we can to see that \nother families don't have to suffer the same grief.\n  Many companies are doing too little to deal with this challenge. They \nblatantly ignore the law, but they are rarely held accountable, even \nwhen their actions or neglect kill loyal employees who work for them. \nOffenders never go to jail. Criminal penalties are so low that \nprosecutors don't pursue these cases. Employers who violate safety laws \nagain and again pay only minimal fines--they treat them as just another \ncost of doing business.\n  We cannot allow these shameful practices to continue. These companies \nare putting millions of workers at risk in factories, construction \nsites, nursing homes, and many other workplaces every day.\n  We also need to hold this Administration accountable for improving \nworker safety and enforcing the safety laws. We should require OSHA to \ndo more to stop serious safety violations before they can hurt or kill \nworkers, instead of sweeping them under the rug. We also need to \nprotect workers with the courage to speak out against health and safety \nviolations in the workplace.\n  The most glaring flaw in current law is that too many workers are \nleft uncovered. The Protecting America's Workers Act will extend the \nscope of the Occupational Safety and Health Act to cover 8 million \npublic employees and millions of transportation and other workers.\n  In addition, the bill imposes jail time--up to ten years, instead of \nonly six months under current law--on those whose blatant violation of \nsafety laws leads to a worker's death. Incredibly, under current law, \nit is only a misdemeanor--punishable by 6 months in jail--for an \nemployer to cause a worker's death through willfully violating our \nsafety and health laws. In fact, we impose sentences twice that long \nfor acts like harassing a wild burro on federal lands. Our laws should \nreflect our serious commitment to protecting workers' safety, instead \nof letting violators off with a slap on the wrist. We also increase \ncivil penalties, to provide additional deterrence against employers.\n  We require the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to \ninvestigate more cases. We give workers and their families more rights \nin the investigation, and provide stronger protections for workers who \nreport health or safety violations.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in fighting for safe workplaces for \nall of America's workers. The promise of OSHA is waiting to be \nfulfilled. The best way for Congress to honor the Nation's dedicated \nworking men and women on this Worker's Memorial Day is to end our \ncomplacency and see that the full promise of OSHA becomes a genuine \nreality for every working family in every community in America.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BIDEN (for himself, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Bingaman, Mrs. Clinton, \n        Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Levin, Mr. Durbin, Mr. \n        Lieberman, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, Ms. Mikulski, \n        Mr. Bayh, Ms. Cantwell, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Corzine, Mr. \n        Jeffords, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Smith, Mr. Dayton, Mr. Akaka, \n        Mr. Reed, Mr. Harkin, Mrs. Boxer, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Reid, Mr. \n        Salazar, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. \n        Schumer, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Specter, Mr. Byrd, Mr. Lautenberg, and \n        Mr. Obama):\n  S. 945. A bill to provide reliable officers, technology, education, \ncommunity prosecutors, and raining in our neighborhoods; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today, I rise to introduce legislation to \nreauthorize the Department of Justice's Office of Community Oriented \nPolicing Services (COPS). This program has achieved what my colleagues \nand I hoped for back when we were debating the 1994 Crime Bill. Prior \nto the final vote, in August of 1994, I stated that ``I will vote for \nthis bill, because, as much as anything I have ever voted on in 22 \nyears in the U.S. Senate, I truly believe that passage of this \nlegislation will make a difference in the lives of the American people. \nI believe with every fiber in my being that if this bill passes, fewer \npeople will be murdered, fewer people will be victims, fewer women will \nbe senselessly beaten, fewer people will continue on the drug path, and \nfewer children will become criminals.''\n  Fortunately, with the creation of the COPS program, we were able to \nform a partnership amongst Federal, State, and local law enforcement \nand create programs that helped drive down crime rates for eight \nconsecutive years. In 1994 we had historically high rates of violent \ncrimes, such as murders, forcible rapes, and aggravated assaults. We \nwere able to reduce these to the lowest levels in a generation. We \nreduced the murder rate by 37.8 percent; we reduced forcible rapes by \n19.1 percent; and we reduced aggravated assaults by 25.5 percent. \nProperty crimes, including auto thefts also were reduced from \nhistorical highs to the lowest levels in decades.\n  How were we able to achieve such great results? Well, we all know it \nwas a combination of factors, but most law enforcement officials credit \nthe Office of Community Oriented Policing with a pivotal role. Indeed, \nin the words of Attorney General Ashcroft the Community Oriented \nPolicing program (``COPS'') has been ``a miraculous success.'' Just a \nfew months ago, Attorney General Gonzalez reached the same conclusion, \nstating that ``we put additional officers on the street and now we have \ncrime at an all-time low.'' In addition, this program has been endorsed \nby every major law enforcement group in the Nation, including the \nInternational Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP), the National \nAssociation of Police Organizations (NAPO), the National Sheriffs \nAssociation (NSA), the International Brotherhood of Police \nOrganizations, the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement \nOfficials (NOBLE), the International Union of Police Associations \n(IUPA), the Fraternal Order of Police, and others. The bottom line is \nthat from the Top Cop in the United States to the beat officer \npatrolling a local community, the impact of this program is clear.\n  Rather than support this program, the Bush Administration and \nRepublican leadership is set on eliminating\n\n[[Page S4563]]\n\nit. President Bush has proposed cuts each year he has been in office, \nand while we have fought to maintain funding for COPS, we are fighting \nan uphill battle. Funding for State and local law enforcement programs \nrun out of the Department of Justice is down 75.6 percent since fiscal \nyear 2002. This year, funding for State and local law enforcement is at \n$118 million for the entire Nation, with no funding for hiring.\n  These cuts are coming at the worst possible time. Local law \nenforcement is facing what I have called a perfect storm. The FBI is \nreprogramming its field agents from local crime to terrorism. \nUndoubtedly, this is necessary given the threats facing our Nation. \nBut, this means that there will be less Federal assistance for drug \ncases, bank robberies, and violent crime. Local law enforcement will be \nrequired to fill the gap left by the FBI in addition to performing more \nand more homeland security duties. Due to budget restraints at the \nlocal level and the unprecedented cuts in Federal assistance they will \nbe less able to do either. Articles in the USA Today and the New York \nTimes highlighted the fact that many cities are being forced to \neliminate officers because of local budgets woes. In fact, New York \nCity has lost over 3,000 officers in the last few years. Other cities, \nsuch as Cleveland, Minnesota, and Houston, TX, are facing similar \nshortages. As a result, local police chiefs are reluctantly pulling \nofficers from the proactive policing activities that were so successful \nin the nineties, and they are unable to provide sufficient numbers of \nofficers for Federal task forces. These choices are not made lightly. \nPolice chiefs understand the value of proactive policing and the need \nto be involved in homeland security task forces; however, they simply \ndon't have the manpower to do it all. Responding to emergency calls \nmust take precedence over proactive programs and task forces, and I \nfear that we will see the impact in our national crime rates soon. \nLocal chiefs and sheriffs are reporting increased gang activity. And, \nmurder rates and auto thefts--two very accurate indicators of crime \ntrends--have gone up for three consecutive years.\n\n  To me, cutting assistance for State and local law enforcement is \ninexplicable, particularly because the need for Federal assistance \nremains so pressing. In fact, last month I offered an amendment to \nrestore funding for the COPS program in the sum of $1 billion. This \namount would have provided enough funding to eliminate the backlog of \npending officer requests of 10,000 from 3,700 jurisdictions throughout \nthe Nation. And, it would have provided funding to support on-going \nneeds this year. Unfortunately, this amendment was voted down on a \nparty-line vote. The Bush Administration's response to these criticisms \nabout its budget is that funding for the Department of Homeland \nSecurity is up. Undoubtedly, these are critical, necessary \nexpenditures, and I believe that the Administration has not invested \nenough for homeland security. We have an obligation to do both. We must \nfund homeland security and invest in the programs that help reduce \ntraditional crime and prevent terrorism. As terrorism and security \nexperts have pointed out, funding additional officers through the COPS \nprogram can help do both.\n  The legislation that I am introducing today provides $1.5 billion per \nyear for six years for the COPS program. This includes $600 million per \nyear for officer hiring grants, $350 million per year for technology \ngrants, and $200 million per year to help local district attorneys hire \ncommunity prosecutors. This funding will help keep faith with our State \nand local law enforcement officers who put their lives on the line \nevery day to keep our communities safe from crime and terrorism. I \nwould ask all of my colleagues to go to their local police chief or \nsheriff and ask them if they should support this legislation, and I \nhope that they will, because if they did, it would be passed 100-0.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 945\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am proud today with Senator Biden \nand several of our colleagues to introduce a bill to reauthorize the \nCommunity Oriented Police Services (COPS) program, which has been so \nvitally important to my State of West Virginia. The bill authorizes \n$1.15 billion to fund operations of the U.S. Department of Justice's \nCOPS Office and to put 50,000 new police officers on the streets of the \nUnited States through 2011. I am a cosponsor of this bill because I \nunderstood how important this program could be when we passed it \noriginally as part of President Clinton's 1994 Crime bill, because I've \nseen how important it is to my State of West Virginia, and because I \nknow that there are few government programs that have done more to make \nthe whole country safer and more secure.\n  President Clinton had a goal of placing 100,000 new police officers \non our streets. As hard as it is to believe, there are opponents of the \nCOPS program. In an attempt to defend their desire to end the program, \nthey are quick to point out that the goal has been met, and even \nexceeded. They would have you believe that the Federal Government \nshould get out of the business of helping local law enforcement do \ntheir jobs. In the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, when police \ndepartments have taken on seemingly innumerable crucial \nresponsibilities in addition to their roles in fighting crime, plans to \nclose out this program have been included in the President's budget \neach year since he took office. For the Fiscal Year 2006 budget, \nfunding for hiring new officers was zeroed out, and funds for ongoing \nprojects were slashed by varying degrees.\n  There is simply no justification for not continuing the successes of \nthis program. The COPS program has allowed State, local, and tribal law \nenforcement agencies in all 50 States and the District of Columbia to \nhire 118,000 new officers since 1994. The violent\n\n[[Page S4565]]\n\ncrime rate has dropped 30 percent in the same period. Recently, \nAttorney General Alberto Gonzales made the connection himself, \ncommenting that these officers were put on the street and crime is at a \nthirty-year low.\n  The COPS program has sent more than $40 million to my home State of \nWest Virginia, allowing 166 jurisdictions to hire nearly 700 officers. \nThere is no way that the citizens of my State could afford to hire and \ntrain this many officers in this amount of time, and no feasible way to \nreplace the benefits the COPS program produces. Many of these towns had \nnever had their own police officers before this, and I can tell you \nthat the presence of those officers has changed lives for the better \nthroughout my State.\n  West Virginia has also benefited from some specialized programs \nadministered by the COPS Office. Our schools, which were once refuges \nfrom crime and danger, now have safety and security concerns best \nhandled by trained law enforcement professionals. The COPS in Schools \n(CIS) program has provided $2 million to hire 20 school resource \nofficers (SROs). In 2004 alone we received more than $457,000 to hire \nfour SROs. Law enforcement agencies in my State have also received $4.7 \nmillion in COPS technology grants, and were making headway on a \nburgeoning crisis in methamphetamine production with the COPS METH \ngrant program. This assistance has allowed police in my State to tap \ninto crime-fighting and data-sharing technologies, and helped protect \nmy constituents from a drug problem spreading through rural America \nlike wildfire.\n  I look forward to enactment of this legislation, and the new \nassistance it will bring to state and local law enforcement agencies \nthroughout West Virginia. Specifically, this legislation will provide: \n$600 million per year through 2011 for 50,000 more cops across the \ncountry; $350 million per year for law enforcement technologies, \nincluding interoperable communications equipment, state-of-the-art DNA \nanalysis, and computer crime mapping; and $200 million annually to hire \nnew prosecutors, to finish the job our new officers have started.\n  I commend Senator Biden for his tireless work on behalf of law \nenforcement and I pledge to do all that I can to see this bill enacted \nfor the good of the people of West Virginia and for all Americans.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN:\n  S. 946. A bill to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to require \nmulti-channel video programming distributors to provide a kid-friendly \ntier of programming; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I strongly believe that parents in our \ncountry should have more wholesome entertainment choices for their \nchildren. To make that possible, I am today introducing legislation to \nrequire that cable and satellite owners allow parents to purchase a \nchild-friendly tier of television programming.\n  For years, the Congress and the Federal Communications Commission \nhave labored, to little avail, to turn off offensive programming with a \nvariety of technologies. My legislation would ensure that America's \nfamilies, 24/7, could turn on programming that is reliably friendly to \nour children.\n  While the legislation ensures that parents have more choices, the \nentertainment industry is assured that it has choices as well. Under \nthe bill, Congress does not direct how the law is to be implemented. \nThe Congress does not set prices. And the Congress does not take any \nstep that is inconsistent with the first amendment.\n  About the only part of the legislation that is nonnegotiable is my \nbelief that Congress should not dawdle any longer when the volume of \ndegrading, violent, and antisocial entertainment our children are \nexposed to continues to grow.\n  Here is what America's parents deal with now. A recent study found \nthat the average child in America has seen 8,000 murders depicted on \ntelevision by the time they graduate from elementary school. Kids see \nabout 10,000 television rapes, assaults, and murders each year. And in \n2004, Americans filed more than 1 million complaints with the Federal \nCommunications Commission about indecent programming.\n  Yesterday the National Cable and Telecommunications Association \nlaunched a new public service campaign to alert subscribers to parental \ncontrol features that are already available and to introduce new larger \nTV rating icons. I haven't studied their proposal, but it certainly \nsounds constructive and I look forward to hearing more about their \nefforts.\n  The legislation I am introducing today is a truly new approach that \nhas teeth. It is going to give parents more kid-friendly entertainment \nchoices that are easy to understand. The legislation would require that \nall cable and satellite operators within 1 year of enactment offer a \nkid-friendly tier of programming. It would require monthly billing \nstatements to include information about how customers can use blocking \ntechnology to stop offensive programming. And it would impose big-\nleague fines of $500,000 a day on any cable or satellite operator who \ndoesn't comply with the requirement that they give parents the chance \nto purchase kid-friendly programming. In this tier parents will know \nthat there will be no content and no advertisements of a violent or \nsexual nature. Parents and adults who are not concerned about the \ncurrent level of violence and sex on television would, of course, have \naccess to those options with respect to current law.\n  This proposal is the first to tell cable and satellite operators they \nmust offer a kid-friendly television tier so parents have more choices. \nThe legislation does not dictate how it must be accomplished. It only \nsays this tier of kid-friendly programming must carry a number of \nchannels.\n  The legislation leaves it up to the operator whether to offer the \nkids tier as part of a basic or expanded basic package or as a \ncompletely separate package.\n\n  Certainly there is going to be some opposition. But I believe good \nquality programming and an option for families could translate to \npretty good profits for those cable and satellite providers. Parents \nare going to find this option very attractive. If children are watching \nTV 4 hours a day, you can bet mom and dad are not able to stand there \nthe whole time. A kids tier is going to take the guesswork out of TV \ntime for America's parents.\n  Now there is an awful lot of guesswork. Time magazine found last \nmonth 53 percent of respondents said they thought the Federal \nCommunications Commission ought to place stricter controls on broadcast \nchannel shows depicting sex and violence. Sixty-eight percent of those \nsurveyed said the entertainment industry has lost touch with viewers' \nmoral standards. Sixty-six percent said there is too much violence on \nopen air TV. Fifty-eight percent said there is too much cursing. Fifty \npercent said there is too much sexual content.\n  I have worked to make sure that this legislation strikes an \nappropriate balance, offering choices to parents, not taking them away. \nA recent Pew Research survey found although 60 percent of Americans are \nvery concerned about what kids see and hear on television, about half \nof those surveyed were more worried about the Government imposing undue \nrestrictions and thought this was essentially the responsibility of the \naudience.\n  So what we are doing here shows a balanced kind of approach in line \nwith the kinds of values Americans are expressing. Don't make choices \nfor parents, but help parents make good choices for their children. \nWith 8 out of 10 American households getting their television through \ncable or satellite programmers, it is time that parents be given the \nchance to sign up for programming that works for their family.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 946\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Kid Friendly TV Programming \n     Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) More than a decade ago, the American Psychological \n     Society concluded that ``There is absolutely no doubt that \n     higher levels of viewing violence on television are\n\n[[Page S4566]]\n\n     correlated with increased acceptance of aggressive attitudes \n     and increased aggressive behavior.''\n       (2) A study in 2003 found that adults who were ``high TV-\n     violence viewers'' as children are more than three-to-four \n     times as likely as other adults to be convicted of a crime \n     and to use violence against their spouses and other adults.\n       (3) Adults who watched more violent programming as children \n     were more likely to be arrested and convicted for spousal and \n     child abuse, murder and aggravated assault.\n       (4) Ten percent of violent acts committed by youths are \n     attributable to their exposure to violence on television.\n       (5) Forty percent of parents surveyed in l999 in Rhode \n     Island reported that at least one symptom of post-traumatic \n     stress disorder occurred after their child viewed a scary \n     event on television, and that this symptom lasted at least 1 \n     month.\n       (6) The average child who watches 2 hours of cartoons a day \n     will view almost 10,000 violent acts a year.\n       (7) Teenagers who watched television with the greatest \n     amount of sexual content were twice as likely to initiate \n     sexual intercourse the following year as those who watched \n     television with the least amount of sexual content.\n       (8) The Kaiser Family Foundation reported in 2002 that 72 \n     percent of teenagers think sex on television influences \n     ``somewhat'' or ``a lot'' the sexual behavior of their peers.\n       (9) The Kaiser Family Foundation reported in 2003 that 64 \n     percent of all television shows have some sexual content, and \n     that in prime time, 71 percent of the top 4 broadcast network \n     shows have some sexual content.\n       (10) The continued exposure of children to obscene, \n     indecent, sexual, or gratuitous or excessively violent \n     content on television is harmful to the public health and \n     welfare of communities across the country.\n       (11) Efforts to limit the exposure of children to \n     television programming that contains material with obscene, \n     indecent, violent, or sexual content, or to impose fines and \n     penalties for the broadcast of such content, have not been \n     successful in protecting children from harmful content.\n       (12) The number of homes in the United States that receive \n     television programming via cable or satellite providers is \n     estimated to have grown to 85 percent of American households, \n     and of that percentage, an estimated 95 percent of the \n     households subscribe to basic or expanded basic programs.\n       (13) The efforts to limit the exposure of children to \n     harmful television content have not been successful because \n     Federal regulatory agencies have not had the authority to \n     require cable and satellite providers to offer a child-\n     friendly tier of programming.\n       (14) Parents need more effective ways to limit the exposure \n     of children to television with harmful content through \n     alternative, child-friendly tiers of programs.\n\n     SEC. 3. BASIC TIER CONTENT RESTRICTIONS.\n\n       Part IV of title VI of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 \n     U.S.C. 631 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n\n     ``SEC. 641. KID-FRIENDLY PROGRAMMING TIER.\n\n       ``(a) In General.--Within 1 months after the date of \n     enactment of the Kid Friendly TV Programming Act of 2005, \n     each multichannel video programming distributor shall offer a \n     child-friendly tier of programming consisting of no fewer \n     than 15 channels.\n       ``(b) Blocking Instructions.--Beginning 6 months after the \n     date of enactment of the Kid Friendly TV Programming Act of \n     2005, each multichannel video programming distributor shall \n     provide, as part of the monthly statement of charges, \n     instructions for how to block any channel whose content a \n     subscriber may wish to block.\n       ``(c) Penalties.--In addition to any other penalty imposed \n     under this Act or title 18, United States Code, failure to \n     comply with the requirements of this section is punishable by \n     a civil penalty of up to $500,000 per day. Each day of such \n     failure shall be considered a separate offense.\n       ``(d) Child-friendly Defined.--In this section, the term \n     `child-friendly tier' means a group of channels that do not \n     carry programming, advertisements, or public service \n     announcements that would be considered inappropriate for \n     children due to obscene, indecent, profane, sexual, or \n     gratuitous and excessively violent content.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORZINE (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Lautenberg, and Mr. \n        Durbin):\n  S. 947. A bill to amend the Occupational Safety and Health Act of \n1970 to modify the provisions relating to citations and penalties; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today on Workers Memorial Day to \nreintroduce the ``Workplace Wrongful Death Accountability Act,'' \nlegislation that would, among other things, increase the maximum \ncriminal penalty for those who willfully violate workplace safety laws \nand cause the death of an employee.\n  Unbelievably, under existing law, that crime is a misdemeanor, and \ncarries a maximum prison sentence of just 6 months. This legislation \nwould increase the penalty for this most egregious workplace crime to \n10 years--making it a felony. The bill also would increase the penalty \nassociated with lying to an OSHA inspector from 6 months to 1 year, and \nwould increase the penalty for illegally giving advance warning of an \nupcoming inspection from 6 months to 2 years.\n  In recent years, the Senators from both sides of the aisle have \njoined together to focus on a shocking succession of corporate \nscandals: Enron, Tyco, WorldCom, to name a few. These revelations of \ncorporate abuse raised the ire and indignation of the American people. \nBut corporate abuses can sometimes go further than squandering employee \npension funds and costing shareholder value. Sometimes, corporate \nabuses can cost lives.\n  My legislation is based on the simple premise that going to work \nshould not carry a death sentence. Annually, more than 6,000 Americans \nare killed on the job, and some 50,000 more die from work-related \nillnesses. Many of those deaths--deaths that leave wives without \nhusbands, brothers without sisters, and children without parents--are \ncompletely preventable.\n  In 2003, the New York Times published an eye-opening, multi-part \nseries that documented the failure of the Federal government to \nprosecute violators of workplace safety laws. The articles were deeply \ndisturbing to anyone concerned about the health and well being of \nworkers in America, detailing one company's pattern of recklessly \ndisregarding basic safety rules. The authors linked at least nine \nemployee deaths in five States--New York, New Jersey, Ohio, Alabama, \nand Texas--over a 7-year period with the failure of a single company, \nMcWane Foundry, to follow established workplace safety regulations. \nThree of those deaths were judged to have been caused by deliberate and \nwillful violations of Federal safety rules.\n  As a result of that article and a subsequent criminal investigation, \nMcWane has begun to clean up its act.\n  But no one should be deluded. McWane is not the only company with a \nrecord of putting employees at risk. Others--although still the clear \nminority--continue to flout workplace safety rules and jeopardize the \nhealth and well being of workers.\n  During the last Congress, the Bush administration recognized that \nthere was a problem and announced its ``enhanced enforcement policy,'' \na small step in the right direction. But this new enforcement policy \ndoes not do enough, and my legislation would ensure that employers are \ndeterred from placing their employees at risk by willfully violating \nsafety law. And if they do willfully violate the law, they will pay a \nprice.\n  While many factors contribute to the unsafe working environment that \nexists at certain jobsites, one easily remedied factor is an \nineffective regime of criminal penalties. The criminal statutes \nassociated with OSHA have been on the books since the 1970s, but--over \ntime--the deterrence value of these important workplace safety laws has \neroded substantially. With the maximum jail sentence a paltry 6 months, \nFederal prosecutors have only a minimal incentive to spend time and \nresources prosecuting renegade employers. According to a recent \nanalysis, since the Occupational Safety and Health Act was enacted, \nonly 11 employers who caused the death of a worker on the job were \nincarcerated.\n  The logic behind this legislation is simple. The bill will increase \nthe incentive for prosecutors to hold renegade employers accountable \nfor endangering the lives of their workers and, thereby, help ensure \nthat OSHA criminal penalties cannot be safely ignored. This will \nprovide the OSHA criminal statute with sufficient teeth to deter the \nsmall percentage of bad actors who knowingly and willfully place their \nemployees at risk.\n  I am proud to be joined by Senators Kennedy, Lautenberg, and Durbin \nin reintroducing the Workplace Wrongful Death Accountability Act and I \nurge my colleagues to support this important piece of legislation. I \nask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 947\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Health Care Quality Improvement Act of \n1986 to expand the National Practitioner Data Bank; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce a very \nimportant piece of legislation, the Safe Healthcare Reporting (SHARE) \nAct, which Senator Lautenberg and I introduced last Congress to add \nnurses and other licensed health care professionals to the National \nPractitioner Databank.\n  In 1986, Congress passed legislation that established a national \ndatabank, the National Practitioner Databank (NPDB), to track \nlicensing, disciplinary, and medical malpractice actions taken against \nU.S. physicians. While the NPDB has served as an important source of \ninformation on physicians, it fails to incorporate critical information \non millions of non-physician licensed health care professionals, \nincluding nurses.\n  In late 2003, it came to light that Charles Cullen, a nurse who had \npracticed for more than a decade in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, had \nmurdered as many as 40 of the patients he cared for during this time. \nAs of today, Mr. Cullen has pleaded guilty to intentionally giving \nlethal doses of drugs to 24 patients.\n  This case has highlighted the need for a national reporting system on \nnurses and other licensed health professionals. As the health care \nworkforce becomes increasingly mobile, such a system would be an \ninvaluable resource to health care employers seeking information on \npotential employees.\n  The SHARE Act will help break the chain of silence currently plaguing \nour health care system. This chain of silence prevented critical \nemployment history on Cullen--including five firings and at least one \nsuspension--from ever reaching his future employers. While Charles \nCullen kept killing people, hospitals kept hiring him. They didn't know \nhis history. They didn't understand the risk he posed to patients. This \nis because hospitals and other employers are reluctant to share \nemployee information because they are afraid of being sued.\n  The goal of our legislation is to make sure that hospitals know--to \nmake sure that employers have access to critical information on health \ncare practitioners. It will ensure that adverse employment actions, \nlicensing and disciplinary actions, and criminal background information \nare available to all health care employers. The SHARE Act mandates that \nhospitals and other health care entities report adverse employment \nactions taken against employees who violate professional standards of \nconduct. This would include things like drug diversion and \nfalsification of documents.\n  Importantly, the legislation protects health care employers from suit \nwhen they, in good faith, report information that they believe is \ntruthful. Any employer who reports false information in an effort to \nsmear a nurse's record would receive no protection under our bill. In \nfact, anyone who abused the information reported to the databank would \nbe fined by the Federal Government.\n\n  Health care employers, such as hospitals and nursing homes, would be \nrequired to report to the National Practitioner Databank, which \ncurrently provides such information on physicians. They would also be \nrequired to report to the appropriate state licensing board. In turn \nthe state licensing board would report the results of its \ninvestigations and licensing or disciplinary actions to the databank. \nThe legislation also encourages nurses and other health care \nprofessionals to report suspected activities to state boards by \nproviding whistleblower protections to those individuals.\n  The SHARE Act also ensures that a practitioner who is subject to \nreporting is informed of the report, offered a hearing on the issue, \nand allowed to comment on the report.\n  I believe that this legislation is a critical first step toward \nimproving access to important information on our health care workforce. \nSince 1986, the Federal Government has required hospitals to report \nemployment information on physicians. It's time we include nurses and \nother health care professionals that provide direct patient care. In \nfact, the average nurse spends more time at a patient's bedside than \nthe patient's physician. We simply must ensure that the person at the \nbedside is competent and professional.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to move this bill through Congress and get it to the President's \ndesk. We must and we can improve patient safety and the integrity of \nour health care system. This bill takes an important step toward that \ngoal.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 948\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide assistance to combat tuberculosis, malaria, \nand other infectious diseases, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, today I have introduced a bill with my \ncolleagues, the senior Senators from Louisiana and Oklahoma, called the \nEliminate Neglected Disease Act of 2005. Neglected diseases are \ndiseases that don't get much attention but nonetheless account for the \nvast majority of all deaths in the world: malaria, tuberculosis, acute \nrespiratory infections, infectious diarrhea. For most of these \ndiseases, our bilateral foreign assistance agency, USAID, is not \nfunding direct interventions in communities using known, life-saving \ntools. The need for our bill could not be more urgent.\n  Given the following, conditions have never been better for the U.S. \nto apply inexpensive, relatively simple interventions to save lives: 1. \nWe know how to cure and/or prevent these diseases.\n  2. Interventions, prevention and/or treatment are relatively cheap. \nCure for malaria = $2. For TB = $11-15. One year of non-curative \ntreatment for AIDS: $500-1,000.\n  3. These diseases are responsible for the vast majority of deaths in \nthe developing world, particularly among children and pregnant women. \nMalaria is the number one killer of kids and pregnant women in Africa, \nkills between 1-2 million people each year but makes about 500 million \nsick! Tuberculosis kills about 2 million people each year. Unlike with \nother diseases, people can not avoid infection with these killers by \nbehavior change.\n  4. Low-hanging fruit--these diseases are so cheap to control, even \nthe modest budgets we have now could make a huge difference if they \nwere spent wisely.\n  Our bill focuses on the following programmatic reform: 1. Direct \ninterventions: requires funding of activities that have a direct impact \non sick people or people at risk of becoming sick. For some programs, \nthis will require a shift of priority in budgets from indirect support \nand advice-giving consultants to actually funding medical treatment, \ncommodity procurement, and disease control activities.\n  2. Accountability: programs must measure performance and prove that \nthey are saving lives. The bill establishes mechanisms to revise or \nterminate contracts that fail to save lives.\n  3. Transparency: Every dollar that the agency awards to combat \ninfectious diseases must be accounted for on a public web site, similar \nto the Global Fund's web site. All signed agreements are posted online, \nas well as progress reports documenting performance on required \ndeliverables and indicators.\n  4. Scientific and Clinical Integrity: The bill provides that \nclinical/medical and public health programs are overseen by the \nagencies of the Federal Government where the core competencies in \nclinical medicine and public health reside. For programs where the lack \nof clinical and scientific expertise has been particularly acute, a \ngroup of Federal and non-government medical and academic experts will \nprovide scientific and medical oversight.\n  5. Coordination and Priority-setting: Up to five Federal agencies are \ncurrently involved in international malaria and tuberculosis programs. \nThe bill would provide for clearer lines of authority and coordination \nfor these programs, and require a strategic planning process to ensure \nthat programs operate according to a outcome-focused 5-year plan.\n  The world community conquered smallpox. We have nearly conquered \npolio and guinea worm. When we acted in concert, we stopped SARS in its \ntracks a few years ago. If these diseases were killing our own citizens \nat\n\n[[Page S4569]]\n\nthe rates they are killing people in poorer countries, we would put an \nend to it using the inexpensive, known methods, in short order. African \nchildren are just as precious as American and European children. To \nthose who have been given much, much is expected. We will be held \nresponsible for how we responded to this crisis. I hope my colleagues \nwill join us in supporting this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FRIST (for himself and Mr. Alexander):\n  S. 955.

A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to provide \nassured punishment for violent crimes against children, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce ``The Jetseta \nGage Prevention and Deterrence of Crimes Against Children Act of \n2005''. This is a very important bill that will protect our children \nfrom the vilest forms of abuse and murder.\n  The urgency of passing legislation of this nature has been growing \nfor the past few months. The murders of Jessica Lunsford, Sara Lunde, \nand Jetseta Gage, who was from my home State of Iowa, have been \nthoroughly covered in the news in recent weeks. Each of these murders \nwas committed by a repeat sex offender. These cases should open our \neyes to the necessity of passing a bill that will give sex offenders \ntougher penalties for the crimes they commit.\n  I would like to take a moment to talk about the murder of the Iowa \ngirl this bill is named for, Jetseta Marrie Gage. On March 24 of this \nyear, Jetseta, a beautiful 10-year-old girl from Cedar Rapids, IA, went \nmissing from her home. Within 12 hours of her disappearance, even \nbefore a body had been found, law enforcement officials took Roger \nBentley into custody, a man who had been previously convicted for \ncommitting lascivious acts with a minor. Unfortunately, this man only \nserved a little over one year in prison for his previous sex crime \nconviction. Two days later, due to a tip received by a woman responding \nto the Amber Alert, Jetseta's body was found stuffed in a cabinet in an \nabandoned mobile home. She had been sexually molested and suffocated \nwith a plastic bag. I can't help but wonder whether Jetseta would still \nbe alive today had her killer received stricter penalties for his first \noffense. It breaks my heart to hear about cases like this, but it's \neven more disheartening when you know that it might have been prevented \nwith adequate sentencing.\n  My bill will help change this by protecting children in three ways. \nIt will establish stiff mandatory minimum sentences, increase penalties \nfor certain crimes against children, and reform the habeas corpus \nsystem for child murderers. Let me now discuss these provisions in \ndetail.\n  The first section on mandatory minimums will guarantee punishment for \ncriminals who commit violent crimes against children. I know that some \nof my colleagues have concerns about mandatory minimums, especially in \nthe context of drug sentences. I understand that concern, but in-light \nof the recent Supreme Court's decision in the Booker/FanFan case, \nsomething must be done to insure that sexual predators receive the \ntypes of sentences fitting for their crimes. In the Booker/FanFan case, \nthe Court held that the Federal Sentencing Guidelines are no longer \nmandatory, thus federal judges have unfettered discretion in \nsentencing. The bill establishes the following mandatory minimums for \nviolent crimes against children: One, where the crime of violence \nresults in death of a child under 15 years, the offender will receive \nthe death penalty or life in prison; two, where the crime of violence \nis kidnapping, sexual assault, or maiming or results in serious bodily \ninjury the offender will receive a prison term from 30 years to life; \nthree, where the crime of violence results in bodily injury of a child \nunder 12 years, the offender will serve a prison term from 15 years to \nlife; four, where a criminal uses a dangerous weapon in the commission \nof a crime against a child, the offender will receive a sentence of 10 \nyears to life; and lastly, five, in any other case of a crime against a \nchild, the offender will receive from 2 years to life.\n\n  The second section of the bill increases the penalties for sexual \noffenses against children. The penalties for these crimes need to be \nadjusted to adequately reflect the gravity of these crimes and the \ndamage they do to children. The bill increases penalties for the \nfollowing nine federal crimes: aggravated sexual abuse of children, \nabusive sexual contact with children, sexual abuse of children \nresulting in death, sexual exploitation of children, activities \nrelating to material involving the sexual exploitation of children, \nactivities relating to material constituting or containing child \npornography, using misleading domain names to direct children to \nmaterial harmful to minors on the internet, production of sexually \nexplicit depictions of children, and conduct relating to child \nprostitution.\n  The third section of the bill will ensure fair and expeditious \nFederal collateral review of convictions for killing a child. It would \ndo this by reforming the habeas corpus system for this crime. For \nexample, in district court parties will be required to move for an \nevidentiary hearing within 90 days of the completion of briefing, the \ncourt must act on the motion within 30 days, and the hearing must begin \n60 days later with completion within 150 days. In addition, this \nsection will require that district-court review be completed within 15 \nmonths of the completion of briefing and that appellate review must be \ncompleted within 120 days of the completion of briefing. Finally, this \nprovision limits Federal review on cases to those claims that present \nmeaningful evidence that the defendant did not commit the crime.\n  The provisions of this bill are strictly designed to protect our \nchildren. I doubt that the members of this body, many of whom have \nyoung children of their own, will have any objections to ensuring that \nperpetrators of crimes against children receive tougher penalties for \ntheir acts. It is unfortunate\n\n[[Page S4570]]\n\nthat it took the recent tragic murders of those 3 beautiful young girls \nfor a law of this nature to be proposed, but I strongly believe that a \nvote for this bill could save the lives of children in the future. We \nhave an obligation as legislators to protect our citizenry. We have an \nobligation as adults to protect our youth. We have an obligation as \nparents to protect our children. I urge my colleagues to join me in \ndoing just that by voting in favor of this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 956\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish a clean coal power initiative, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I am introducing the Clean Coal Power \nInitiative Act of 2005. I am pleased that Senator Landrieu is joining \nme in introducing this legislation.\n  The United States needs to have a diverse array of energy sources. It \nis crucial to our economy and our national security.\n  Coal is an important resource that is a solution to keeping our \neconomy moving forward and reducing our reliance on foreign energy.\n  Today, coal fuels 52 percent of the electricity used to heat our \nhomes and schools and run our factories. Coal can play an even greater \nrole in meeting future demand because it constitutes 90 percent of U.S. \nenergy reserves resources, enough to last more than 200 years at \ncurrent consumption rates.\n  The Energy Information Administration recently stated that coal is \nexpected to remain the primary fuel for electricity generation over the \nnext 2 decades.\n  Generations of Kentuckians have made a living and raised families by \nworking in the coal fields. They are proud to do such vital work for \nour country's energy future.\n  I believe that coal must be part of our energy plans. It is plentiful \nand we do not have to go far to get it.\n  It can help meet our energy needs as the cost of natural gas \ncontinues to rise dramatically, and is forecasted to remain at \nhistorical highs and as electricity demands continue to increase.\n  In order for us to take full advantage of coal's benefits, I believe \nwe must balance conservation with the need for increased production.\n  That is where clean coal comes in.\n  The bill I am introducing today will help create new clean coal \ntechnologies by authorizing the Department of Energy to establish a \nresearch and development clean coal program. This will result in a \nsignificant reduction of emissions and a sharp increase in efficiency \nof turning coal into electricity.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SARBANES (for himself and Ms. Mikulski):\n  S. 958. A bill to amend the National Trails System Act to designate \nthe Star-Spangled Banner Trail in the States of Maryland and Virginia \nand the District of Columbia as a National Historic Trail; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SARBANES (for himself, Ms. Mikulski, Ms. Landrieu, and Mr. \n        Levin):\n  S. 959. A bill to establish the Star-Spangled Banner and War of 1812 \nBicentennial Commission, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I am introducing two measures to \ncommemorate America's second war of independence--the War of 1812--and \naid in the efforts to preserve sites related to this important period \nin our Nation's history.\n  Pursuant to legislation that I authored in the 106th Congress, the \nNational Park Service recently completed a study of the feasibility and \ndesirability of designating a Star-Spangled Banner National Historic \nTrail commemorating the routes used by the British and Americans during \nthe 1814 Chesapeake Campaign of the War of 1812.\n  The Star-Spangled Banner National Historic Trail Feasibility Study \nand Environmental Impact Statement, completed in March 2004, determined \nthat five of eight trail segments studied fully met the criteria for \nNational Historic Trails and recommended this designation.\n  The legislation I am introducing today implements the recommendations \nof the National Park Service's study. The Star-Spangled Banner National \nHistoric Trail Act amends the National Trails System Act to designate \nthe Star-Spangled Banner Trail in the States of Maryland and Virginia \nand the District of Columbia as a National Historic Trail. I am pleased \nthat my colleague Senator Mikulski is joining with me as a cosponsor of \nthis bill. A similar companion bill has also been introduced in the \nHouse by my colleagues Congressmen Cardin and Gilchrest.\n  The sites along the proposed Star-Spangled Banner National Historic \nTrail would mark some of the most important events of the War of 1812. \nThe trail, commemorating the only combined naval and land attack on the \nUnited States, begins with the June 1814 battles between the British \nNavy and the American Chesapeake Flotilla in St. Leonard's Creek in \nCalvert County, and ends at Fort McHenry in Baltimore, site of the \ncomposition of our national anthem, and the ultimate defeat of the \nBritish.\n  In my view, the designation of this route as a National Historic \nTrail will serve as a reminder of the importance of the concept of \nliberty to all who experience it. The Star-Spangled Banner National \nHistoric Trail will also give long overdue recognition to those \npatriots whose determination to stand\n\n[[Page S4572]]\n\nfirm against enemy invasion and bombardment preserved this liberty for \nfuture generations of Americans.\n  The second measure I am introducing today seeks to ensure that the \nupcoming bicentennial of the War of 1812 and the poem which became our \nnational anthem will be appropriately observed. I am pleased to be \njoined by Senators Mikulski, Landrieu and Levin in offering this \nlegislation.\n  The Star-Spangled Banner and War of 1812 Bicentennial Commission Act \nimplements another recommendation included in the aforementioned \nNational Park Service study by creating a commission, made up in part \nby citizens from nine states and the District of Columbia, to ensure a \nsuitable national observance of the War of 1812. The commission is \ntasked with planning, encouraging, developing, executing and \ncoordinating programs commemorating the historic events that preceded \nand are associated with the War of 1812. Among other things, the \ncommission is charged with facilitating this commemoration throughout \nthe United States and internationally.\n  As the bicentennial of the War of 1812 rapidly approaches, a plan to \nmark the lasting contributions that our forebears made during this \ncritical period in our Nation's history is needed. In my view, both of \nthese measures will work to ensure that these patriots' commitment to \nthe principles of liberty and sovereignty will not be forgotten.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting their passage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ENZI (for himself, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Johnson, and Mr. \n        Thomas):\n  S. 960. A bill to amend the Packers and Stockyards Act, 1921, to \nprohibit the use of certain anti-competitive forward contracts; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, whenever there is a crisis the media has \nalways served to focus the nation's attention on the problem and who \nhas been affected by it. Then it has been up to us, in the Congress, to \nreview the problem and determine whether or not there was anything we \ncould do to ease the suffering and repair the damage to someone's \nproperty and their livelihood.\n  Most of the time, when the media spots a crisis it is of such a \nmagnitude that the pictures we see of the suffering are devastating and \npowerful. The images clearly cry out to us to take action and do what \nwe can to restore, as much as possible, the lives of these people to \nnormalcy.\n  We have all seen the pictures of the devastating tornadoes or other \nnatural disasters that have wreaked havoc wherever they have touched. \nStory after story has appeared in print and on television showing \nproperty destroyed, places of business torn in pieces, jobs in jeopardy \nand lives forever changed by the fury of a few moments of severe \nweather. Tornadoes don't last a long time, but they leave a path of \ndevastation in their wake that leaves those affected by it forever \nchanged.\n  Even as we consider the devastation of tornadoes, earthquakes, or \nother natural disasters, there are those in my state who have seen \ntheir livelihoods drastically affected by weather and federal \nregulation, but they haven't been so visible to us because we haven't \nseen their faces on the nightly news or read their stories in the \nnational newspapers. That is because not everyone who has seen their \nlivelihood so drastically affected can be portrayed with quite the same \nkind of powerful images that depict those who have been touched by the \nravages of severe weather patterns. Some problems that destroy \nlivelihoods and weaken industries are far more subtle and more \ndifficult to track.\n  Instead of being destroyed by a single blow, the industry I am \nreferring to is being slowly put to death by the cruelest of methods--\nthousands of small cuts brought on by the lethal combination of several \nyears of drought, ambiguous regulations that are too easily taken \nadvantage of and the lax enforcement of existing law which has allowed \nfor the manipulation of the system to one group's advantage.\n  Right now as I speak to you on the floor of the Senate, if you are a \nrancher in the West, you have two major problems affecting your ability \nto earn a living and provide for your family. The first is the \ncontinuing drought which has made it so difficult for ranchers to tend \ntheir cattle and provide them with good, affordable grazing.\n  The second is a regulatory nightmare that has held livestock \nproducers captive by the chains of unfair and manipulative contracts. \nIt is this regulatory nightmare that must be addressed, and which \nbrings me to the floor today as I offer legislation to break the chains \nand require livestock contracts to contain a fixed base price and be \ntraded in open, public markets.\n  So, what is this regulation that is destroying the health of our \nfamily ranchers? It's a practice called ``captive supply,'' a business \npractice not well known to those outside of the industry, but a \npractice that has had a tremendous impact on the ranchers of the West.\n  If you haven't heard about the problem, I must point out that our \nranchers have tried to bring it to our attention, but we haven't fully \nfocused on their needs. Whenever I travel to Wyoming, or hold a Town \nMeeting, or go over the week's mail that I receive from \nmy constituents, I hear the cries for help from our ranchers in \nWyoming, and throughout the West. One by one, and without exception, \nthey are all clamoring for attention and relief so they can continue \nthe work that so many in their family have done for so many years.\n\n  I could bring a stack of letters to the Floor that come from people \nall across my State about the problems they face. But, in the interests \nof time, I will read a small excerpt from one that will give you an \nidea of how bad things are in the ranching industry as our ranchers try \nto deal with captive supply.\n  A letter I received from a rancher in Lingle said that the issue of \ncaptive supply needed to be reviewed and addressed because it was \n``slowly but surely putting small farmers/feeders out of business.'' He \nthen added, ``until the existing laws are enforced in this area of \nillegal activities, all other plans or laws will be of very little \nconsequence.''\n  So what is captive supply--and how is it harming our Nation's \nranchers to such an extent? Simply put, captive supply refers to the \nownership by meat packers of cattle or the contracts they issue to \npurchase livestock. It is done to ensure that packers will always have \na consistent supply of livestock for their slaughterlines.\n  The original goal of captive supply makes good business sense. All \nbusinesses want to maintain a steady supply of animals to ensure a \nconstant stream of production and control costs.\n  But captive supply allows packers to go beyond good organization and \nbusiness performance--to market manipulation--and this is where the \nproblem lies.\n  The packing industry is highly concentrated. Four companies control \napproximately 80 percent of U.S. fed cattle slaughter. Using captive \nsupply and the market power of concentration, packers can purposefully \ndrive down the prices by refusing to buy in the open market. This \ndeflates all livestock prices and limits the market access of producers \nthat haven't aligned with specific packers.\n  We made an attempt to address the problem of captive supply on the \nSenate floor during the Farm Bill debate, but the amendment to ban \npacker ownership of livestock more than 14 days before slaughter did \nnot survive the conference committee on the Farm Bill. However, the \nproblems caused by captive supplies are alive and well, just as Wyoming \nproducers have testified to me in the phone calls, letters, faxes and \nemails I receive from them. Although I supported the packer ban and \nhave cosponsored it again this Congress, I do not think that banning \npacker ownership of livestock will solve the entire captive supply \nproblem. Packers are using numerous methods beyond direct ownership to \ncontrol cattle and other livestock.\n  Currently, packers maintain captive supply through various means \nincluding direct ownership, forward contracts, and marketing \nagreements. The difference between the three is subtle, so let me take \na moment to describe how they differ. Direct ownership refers to \nlivestock owned by the packer. In forward contracts, producers agree to \nthe delivery of cattle one week or\n\n[[Page S4573]]\n\nmore before slaughter with the price determined before slaughter. \nForward contracts are typically fixed, meaning the base price is set.\n  As with forward contracts, marketing agreements also call for the \ndelivery of livestock more than one week before slaughter, but the \nprice is determined at or after slaughter. A formula pricing method is \ncommonly used for cattle sold under marketing agreements. In formula \npricing, instead of a fixed base price, an external reference price, \nsuch as the average price paid for cattle at a certain packing plant \nduring one week, is used to determine the base price of the cattle. I \nfind this very disturbing because the packer has the ability to \nmanipulate the weekly average at a packing plant by refusing to buy in \nthe open market. Unfortunately, marketing agreements and formula \npricing are much more common than forward contracts.\n\n  I realize it may be difficult to grasp the seriousness of the \nsituation if you aren't familiar with the cattle market. Most of us \nhaven't signed a contract to sell a load of livestock, but many of us \nhave sold a house. To illustrate the seriousness of the problem, let's \nexplore how you would sell a house using a formula-priced contract in a \nmarket structured like the current livestock market.\n  It is May, and you know you will be selling your home in September. \nAs a wise seller, you want to find a buyer for your home before that \ntime. It turns out that other people don't really buy homes from each \nother anymore. In fact, four main companies have taken over 80 percent \nof all real estate transactions. You really have no choice but to deal \nwith one of these companies.\n  One of them offers you a contract, stating you will receive $10,000 \nover the average price of what other, similar homes are selling for in \nyour area in September. To manage your risk and ensure a buyer, you \nhave just been practically forced to sign a contract that doesn't \nspecify how much you will receive for your house.\n  That tingle of fear in the pit of your stomach becomes full-fledged \npanic when you close the deal in September. You see, the four real \nestate companies have been planning ahead. They decide to pull away \nfrom the market. All the homes selling in September that aren't \ncontracted to the companies flood the market and the price for homes in \nyour area drops $12,000. By trying to manage your risk, you sold your \nhome for $2,000 below average.\n  As a homeowner, you would be outraged, wouldn't you? You would want \nto know why anyone had the ability to legally take advantage of you. \nLivestock producers have the same questions when they lose to the \nmarket pressures applied by captive supply. Captive supply gives \npackers the ability to discriminate against some producers. And those \nproducers pay for it with their bottom line. At the same time, packers \nuse contracts and marketing agreements to give privileged access and \npremiums to other producers regardless of the quality of their product. \nThese uses of captive supply should be illegal. In fact, they are.\n  Section 202 of the Packers and Stockyards Act states in (3) (a) and \n(b):\n  ``It shall be unlawful for any packer with respect to livestock . . . \nto: (a) Engage in or use any unfair, unjustly discriminatory, or \ndeceptive practice or device; or (b) Make or give any undue or \nunreasonable preference or advantage to any particular person or \nlocality in any respect, or subject any particular person or locality \nto any undue or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage in any respect''\n  Packers that practice price discrimination toward some producers and \nprovide undue preferences to other producers are clearly in violation \nof the law. But this law is not being enforced. So what we are left \nwith are unenforced laws or no laws at all to protect the independent \nproducer. Since the Packers and Stockyards Act is not being enforced \nand the cost of enforcing the law on a case-by-case basis in the courts \nis expensive and time-consuming, today I propose that the Senate take \naction.\n\n  Most laws require enforcement. They are like speed limits on a \ncountry road. No one pays the sign any attention unless the driver is \nsharing the road with an agent of the law who will enforce it like a \npolice car. This section of the Packers and Stockyards Act is like a \nsign on the road of commerce that no one is paying attention to because \nthe police are busy doing something else. The bill I am introducing \ntoday is not just another sign on the road. It is a speed bump. It \ndoesn't just warn cars to go slower, it makes it much more difficult \nfor them to speed.\n  My bill does two things to create the speed bump. It requires that \nlivestock producers have a fixed base price in their contracts. It also \nputs these contracts up for bid in the open market where they belong.\n  Under this bill, forward contracts and marketing agreements must \ncontain a fixed, base price on the day the contract is signed. This \nprevents packers from manipulating the base price after the point of \nsale. You may hear allegations that this bill ends quality-driven \nproduction, but it does not prevent adjustments to the base price after \nslaughter for quality, grade or other factors outside packer control. \nIt prevents packers from changing the base price based on factors that \nthey do control. Contracts that are based on the futures market are \nalso exempted from the bill's requirements.\n  In an open market, buyers and sellers would have the opportunity to \nbid against each other for contracts and could witness bids that are \nmade and accepted. Whether they take the opportunity to bid or not is \ntheir choice, the key here is that they have access to do so.\n  My bill also limits the size of contracts to the rough equivalent of \na load of livestock, meaning 40 cattle or 30 swine. It doesn't limit \nthe number of contracts that can be offered by an individual. This key \nportion prevents small and medium-sized livestock producers, like those \nfound in Wyoming, from being shut out of deals that contain thousands \nof livestock per contract.\n  Requiring a firm base price and an open and transparent market ends \nthe potential for price discrimination, price manipulation and undue \npreferences. These are not the only benefits of my bill. It also \npreserves the very useful risk management tool that contracts provide \nto livestock producers. Contracts help producers plan and prepare for \nthe future. My bill makes contracts and marketing agreements an even \nbetter risk management tool because it solidifies the base price for \nthe producer. Once the agreement is made, a producer can have \nconfidence on shipping day in his ability to feed his family during the \nnext year because he will know in advance how much he can expect to \nreceive for his livestock.\n  This bill also encourages electronic trading. An open and public \nmarket would function much like the stock market, where insider trading \nis prohibited. The stock market provides a solid example of how \nelectronic livestock trading can work to the benefit of everyone \ninvolved. For example, price discovery in an open and electronic market \nis automatic.\n  Captive supply is still weighing on the minds and hurting the \npocketbooks of ranchers in Wyoming and across the United States. \nWyoming ranchers encourage me to keep up the good fight on this issue \non every trip I make to my home state. The economic soul of Wyoming is \nbuilt on the foundation of small towns and small businesses. All \nlivestock producers, even small and medium-sized ones, should have a \nfair chance to compete in an honest game that allows them to get the \nbest price possible for their product. We must do everything we can to \nkeep our small producers in business.\n  My bill removes one of the largest obstructions preventing livestock \nproducers from competing formula-priced contracts. I ask my colleagues \nto assist me in giving their constituents and mine the chance to \nperform on a level playing field.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Bunning, Mr. \n        Bingaman, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Coleman, Mr. Johnson, and \n        Mr. Nelson of Nebraska):\n  S. 962. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \ncredit to holders of qualified bonds issued to finance certain energy \nprojects, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the capital cost to install new \nrenewable generation capacity is three to ten\n\n[[Page S4574]]\n\ntimes more expensive than the cost to install conventional gas \ngeneration. Given these costs, Federal production tax credits have been \navailable over the past decade to investor-owned utilities and private \ndevelopers for renewable generation from wind, closed loop biomass and \npoultry waste. I worked in the JOBs bill last year to extend these tax \nincentives and expand them to additional resources, such as open loop \nbiomass, animal waste nutrients, landfill gas, municipal solid waste, \nsolar, geothermal and small hydro irrigation systems. I also fought to \nextend these incentives to electric cooperatives and public power \nsystems, and today am releasing a new proposal, ``Clean Energy Bonds,'' \nthat provides them with an important financing tool.\n  Tax incentives for renewable and clean coal generation will be an \nimportant part of a balanced energy bill that the Senate will soon \nassemble. Such incentives enhance energy security by providing for \ndiverse fuel choices, provide options in the face of high prices of oil \nand gas, and are a key component of ensuring that utilities can meet \nclean air requirements and climate change goals. The Administration has \nasserted that incentives for renewable generation are necessary for a \nbalanced energy bill. And, all electricity generators recently agreed \nin a MOU with the Department of Energy on voluntary goals that address \nclimate change and support President Bush in his efforts to reduce the \ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emission intensity of the U.S. economy. As part of \nthe MOU, the Department of Energy and all signatories agreed to promote \npolicies that ``provide investment stimulus on an equitable basis to \nall segments of the power sector in order to accelerate use of existing \nGHG-reducing technologies. . . .''\n  As the MOU recognizes, electric cooperatives and public power systems \nneed access to incentives in order to provide the latest clean \ntechnologies and renewable generation to their communities, just as the \nprivate sector does. Many of these utilities are ideally located to \ntake advantage of opportunities to generate from these primarily rural \nresources. These utilities cannot, however, offset the high cost of \nthese resources through the conventional tax incentives Congress has \nprovided to the private sector. Without these incentives, such \ngeneration is simply unaffordable for the consumers they serve.\n  Electric cooperatives and public power systems are not-for-profit, \nand therefore do not pay federal income tax. Not-for-profit utilities \ndo not pay shareholders. Cooperatives return revenues above cost of \nservice to their members, and public power systems use their revenue to \nreduce rates or reinvest in utility infrastructure. Traditional tax \nincentives do not work for not-for-profit utilities as they have no \nfederally taxable income to offset. In order for Congress to fully \nrealize the benefits of tax incentives that are designed to make \nrenewable energy economic, an incentive tailored to the unique \ncharacteristics of not-for-profit utilities is required. All three \nutility sectors must be able to participate in incentives in order for \nemerging technologies to fully realize their potential and become \neconomic.\n  Clean energy bonds can provide electric cooperatives and public power \nsystems with an incentive comparable to the production tax credits that \nare available for the private sector. The bill would make technologies \nthat are eligible for the production tax credit under section 45 \neligible for the bond.\n  Under the bill, the electric cooperative, cooperative lender or \nmunicipal utility (``issuer'') would issue the clean energy bond. With \na conventional bond, the issuer must pay interest to the bondholder. \nBut with a clean energy bond, the Federal Government pays a tax credit \nto the bondholder in lieu of the issuer paying interest to the \nbondholder. Treasury sets the rate of the credit in an amount that \npermits the issuance of the tax credit bond without discount and \nwithout interest cost to the issuer. The bondholder can deduct the \namount of the tax credit from their total income tax liability. The \nbonds are taxable, so if the credit is worth $100 and the bondholder is \nin the 35 percent bracket, the bondholder would deduct $65 from their \ntax liability.\n  Public power systems have long used bonds to finance projects for \ninfrastructure improvements and upgrades. By creating familiar \nfinancial instruments for public power systems and electric \ncooperatives to use, the bond market will have the faith and \nunderstanding to purchase these financial products because of the \nlongstanding success of municipal bonds.\n  The Clean Energy Bonds Act of 2005 will become an important part of a \nbalanced energy bill. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this bill that \nis needed to push renewable generation options further than production \ntax credits alone.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALEXANDER (for himself, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Vitter, and Mr. \n        Johnson):\n  S. 964.

REPEAL.\n\n       Sections 1014 and 1015 of the Urban Park and Recreation \n     Recovery Act of 1978 (16 U.S.C. 2513, 2514) are repealed.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, today I rise with the Senator from \nTennessee, Mr. Alexander, my colleague from Louisiana, Mr. Vitter, and \nthe senior Senator from South Dakota, Mr. Johnson, to introduce \nlegislation which we believe is a new and enhanced version of one of \nthe most significant conservation efforts ever considered by Congress.\n  The Americans Outdoors Act is a landmark multi-year commitment to \nconservation programs directly benefitting all 50 States and hundreds \nof local communities. It creates a conservation royalty earned from the \nproduction of oil and gas found on the Outer Continental Shelf, OCS, \nand directs it towards the restoration of coastal wetlands, \npreservation of wildlife habitat, and to help build and maintain local \nand state parks for our children and grandchildren.\n  By enacting this legislation, we will be making the most significant \ncommitment of resources to conservation ever. It will ensure a positive \nlegacy of protecting, preserving and enhancing critical wildlife \nhabitat, open green spaces and the opportunity for Americans to enjoy \ntheir outdoors today and for generations to come. Our legislation \nbuilds on an effort made during the 106th Congress that was supported \nby governors, mayors and a coalition of more than 5,000 organizations \nfrom throughout the country.\n  Unfortunately, despite widespread support, our efforts were cut short \nbefore a bill could be signed into law. Instead a commitment was made \nby those who opposed the legislation to guarantee funding for these \nprograms each year through the appropriation process.\n  However, as we have painfully witnessed since then, that commitment \nhas not been met. What has happened is exactly what those of us who \ninitiated the effort always anticipated. Each of these significant \nprograms continues to be shortchanged and a number of them have been \nleft out altogether or forced to compete with each other for Federal \nresources.\n  The legislation we are introducing today provides reliable, \nsignificant and steady funding for the urgent and worthy conservation \nand outdoor recreation needs of our states and rapidly expanding urban \nand suburban areas. What makes more sense than to take a portion of \nrevenues from a great but depleting capital asset of the Nation--\noffshore Federal oil and gas resources--and reinvest them into \nsustaining our Nation's natural resources: wetlands; parks and \nrecreation areas and wildlife?\n  The Americans Outdoors Act dedicates assured funding for four \ndistinct programs and honors promises made long ago to the American \npeople. They include:\n  Coastal Impact Assistance--$450 million to oil and gas producing \ncoastal States to mitigate the various impacts of states that serve as \nthe ``platform'' for the crucial development of Federal offshore energy \nresources from the OCS as well as provide for wetland restoration. This \nprogram merely acknowledges the impacts to and contribution of States \nthat are providing the energy to run our country's economy.\n\n[[Page S4580]]\n\n  Since the 1.76 billion acre energy frontier of the OCS was officially \nopened to significant oil and gas exploration in 1953, no single region \nhas contributed as much to our Nation's energy production. In fact, the \nOCS supplies more oil to our Nation than any other country including \nSaudi Arabia. Today, the OCS represents more than 25 percent of our \nNation's natural gas production and more than 30 percent of our \ndomestic oil production--with the promise of reaching 40 percent by \n2008. It is estimated that 60 percent of the oil and natural gas still \nto be discovered in the U.S. will come from the OCS.\n  An average of more than $5 billion in revenues from oil and gas \nproduction are returned to the Federal treasury each year from the \nOCS--$145 billion since Production began. That is the second biggest \ncontributor of revenue to the Federal treasury after income taxes.\n  Our legislation seeks to address a historical inequity. The Mineral \nLands Leasing Act of 1920 shares automatically with States 50 percent \nof revenues from mineral production on Federal lands within that \nState's boundaries. These funds are distributed to States \nautomatically, outside the budget process and not subject to \nappropriations. In fiscal year 2004, the State of Wyoming received $564 \nmillion as a result of this law and the State of New Mexico received \n$365 million. But, there is no similar provision in law for coastal \nproducing States to share Federal oil and gas revenues generated on the \nOCS.\n  For both onshore and offshore production, the justification for \nsharing with the State is the same: The State serves as the platform \nwhich enables the Federal Government to support a basic element of our \ndaily lives--turning on our lights, heating our homes and running our \ncommuter trains.\n\n  In light of the OCS's vital contribution to our Nation's energy \nneeds, economy and national security, it see only fair and logical that \nwe should return a share of these revenues to the few States that are \nproviding this crucial supply of energy. The revenues should be \ndistributed automatically based on what is produced off a State's \ncoastline and a portion of each State's allocation should be shared \nwith coastal counties and parishes. They battle every day with the \nforces of nature that are steadily undermining our energy security by \nwashing away the barrier islands and marshes that protect critical \ninfrastructure necessary to deliver it.\n  When Hurricane Ivan struck back in September, it should have been a \nwake up call to us all. Although the storm did not hit Louisiana \ndirectly, its impact on the price and supply of oil and gas in this \ncountry could still be felt 4 months later. One can only imagine what \nthe impact would have been had Ivan cut a more Western path in the \nGulf. How many more hurricane seasons are we going to spend playing \nRussian roulette with our oil and gas supply? Returning a portion of \nOCS revenues to Louisiana and other coastal producing States is crucial \nto restoring and preserving these vital wetlands and the billions in \nenergy investments they protect.\n  This bill will provide $450 million for the State side of the Land \nand Water Conservation Fund, LWCF, to provide stable funding to States \nfor the planning and development of State and local parks and \nrecreation facilities. The allocation to States would be 60 percent \nequally among all 50 States and 40 percent based on relative \npopulation. This program provides greater revenue certainty for State \nand local governments to help them meet their recreational needs \nthrough recreational facility development and resource protection--all \nunder the discretion of State and local authorities while protecting \nthe rights of private property owners.\n  This bill would provide for Wildlife Conservation, Education and \nRestoration. A total of $350 million is allocated to all 50 States \nthrough the successful program of Pittman-Robertson for the \nconservation of non-game and game species, with the principal goal of \npreventing species from becoming endangered or listed under the \nEndangered Species Act. By taking steps now to prevent species from \nbecoming endangered we are able to not only conserve the significant \ncultural heritage of wildlife enjoyment for the people of this country, \nbut also avoid the substantial costs associated with recovery for \nendangered species.\n  Allocations to States would be based on a formula of two-thirds \nrelative population and one-third relative land area and the Urban \nParks and Recreation Recovery Program, UPARR--$125 million in the form \nof matching grants, 70 percent, to provide direct assistance to our \ncities and towns so that they can focus on the needs of their \npopulations within the more densely inhabited areas around the country \nwhere there are fewer green-spaces, playgrounds and soccer fields for \nour youth.\n  I would also like to acknowledge our interest in several programs \nthat are not part of this initial package but will be considered as the \nbill moves through the process. For example, the Federal side of the \nLand and Water Conservation Fund, which focuses primarily on Federal \nland acquisition. The goal of the Federal side of the LWCF was to share \na significant portion of revenues from offshore development with States \nto provide for protection and public use of the natural environment. It \nis our intention to discuss this program with our colleagues on the \nSenate Energy and Natural Resources Committee with the goal of \ndeveloping a compromise that will garner broad support. In addition, \nother worthy programs that are not part of the legislation we are \nintroducing today but ideally would be part of a larger more \ncomprehensive effort include Historic Preservation, Payment in Lieu of \nTaxes, PILT, and the Forest Legacy program.\n  While we confront a time of war, budget deficits and a struggling \neconomy, setting aside a portion of oil and gas royalties to our States \nand localities for initiatives such as outdoor spaces or recreation \nfacilities for our children to play could not be more crucial. Programs \nsuch as the State side of the Land and Water Conservation Fund are in \nfact the economic stimulus that our States and cities need in these \ntimes. It is time we take some of the proceeds we extract from our \nearth and reinvest them into conserving our great outdoors for \ngenerations to come. To continue to do otherwise, as we have done for \nthe last 50 years, is not only environmentally and fiscally \nirresponsible. It ignores our American duty of stewardship to our \nNation, our planet and our children.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH (for himself and Mrs. Lincoln):\n  S. 965. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to reduce \nthe recognition period for built-in gains for subchapter S \ncorporations; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce the Small \nBusiness Growth and Opportunity Act of 2004 along with my Finance \nCommittee colleague, Senator Blanche Lincoln.\n  This legislation will allow S corporations to liquidate unproductive \nassets freeing up capital to be used to grow the business and create \nnew jobs.\n  There are about 2.9 million of these small and family-owned \nbusinesses in all 50 States. Over the past few years, many of these \nsmall businesses have been forced to lay off workers and delay capital \ninvestment. At the same time, the tax code forces them to hold on to \nunproductive and inefficient assets or face the double tax period of \nthe corporate ``built-in gains'' tax.\n  Under current law, businesses that convert from a C corporation to S \ncorporation status are penalized by a double tax burden for a period of \n10 years if they sell assets they owned as a C corporation. This tax \npenalty is imposed at the corporate level on top of normal shareholder-\nlevel taxes, making the sale and reinvestment of these assets \nprohibitively expensive. In some States, this double-tax burden can \nexceed 70 percent of the built-in gain.\n  Clearly this tax penalty is neither justifiable nor sustainable as a \nreasonable business matter. The built-in gains tax 1. limits cash flow \nand availability, 2. encourages excess borrowing because the S \ncorporation cannot access the locked-in value of its own assets, and 3. \nprevents these small businesses from growing and creating jobs.\n  While I would like to see even more generous relaxation of these \nrules, for revenue considerations this legislation will reduce the \nbuilt-in gains recognition period (the holding period) from 10\n\n[[Page S4581]]\n\nyears to 7 years. And, this three-year reduction would be a significant \nstart in easing this unproductive tax burden on these small and family-\nowned businesses.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Senate Finance \nCommittee and hope the Committee will consider this proposal this year.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 965\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. REDUCED RECOGNITION PERIOD FOR BUILT-IN GAINS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Paragraph (7) of section 1374(d) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to definitions and \n     special rules) is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(7) Recognition period.--The term `recognition period' \n     means the 7-year period beginning with the 1st day of the 1st \n     taxable year for which the corporation was an S corporation. \n     For purposes of applying this section to any amount \n     includible in income by reason of distributions to \n     shareholders pursuant to section 593(e), the preceding \n     sentence shall be applied without regard to the duration of \n     the recognition period in effect on the date such \n     distribution.''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--\n       (1) General rule.--The amendment made by this section shall \n     apply to any recognition period in effect on or after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (2) Special application to existing periods exceeding 7 \n     years.--Any recognition period in effect on the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the length of which is greater than 7 \n     years, shall end on such date.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER (for herself and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 966. A bill to designate a United States courthouse located in \nFresno, California, as the ``Robert E. Coyle United States \nCourthouse''; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation to \nname the Federal courthouse building now being completed at Tulare and \n``O'' Streets in downtown Fresno, CA the ``Robert E. Coyle United \nStates Courthouse.''\n  It is fitting that the Federal courthouse in Fresno be named for \nSenior U.S. District Judge Robert E. Coyle, who is greatly respected \nand admired for his work as a judge and for his foresight and \npersistence that contributed so much to the Fresno Courthouse project. \nJudge Coyle has been a leader in the effort to build a new courthouse \nin Fresno for more than a decade. Indeed, he personally supervises this \nproject. He is often seen with his hard hat in hand, walking from his \nchambers to the new building to meet project staff.\n  Judge Coyle, working with the Clerk of the United States District \nCourt for the Eastern District, conceived and founded a program called \n``Managing a Capitol Construction Program'' to help others understand \nthe process of having a courthouse built. This Eastern District program \nwas so well received by national court administrators that it is now a \nnationwide program run by Judge Coyle.\n  In addition to meeting the needs of the court for additional space, \nthe courthouse project has become a key element in the downtown \nrevitalization of Fresno. Judge Coyle's efforts, and those in the \ncommunity with whom he has worked, produced a major milestone when the \ngroundbreaking for the new courthouse took place.\n  Judge Coyle has had a distinguished career as an attorney and on the \nbench. Appointed to California's Eastern District bench by President \nRonald Reagan in 1982, Judge Coyle has served as a judge for the \nEastern District for 20 years, including 6 years as senior judge. Judge \nCoyle earned his law degree from the University of California, Hastings \nCollege of the Law in 1956. He then worked for Fresno County as a \nDeputy District Attorney before going into private practice in 1958 \nwith McCormick, Barstow, Sheppard, Coyle & Wayte, where he remained \nuntil his appointment by President Reagan.\n  Judge Coyle is very active in the community and has served in many \njudicial leadership positions, including: Chair of the Space and \nSecurity Committee; Chair of the Conference of the Chief District \nJudges of the Ninth Circuit; President of the Ninth Circuit District \nJudges Association; Member of the Board of Governors of the State Bar \nof California; and President of the Fresno County Bar.\n  My hope is that, in addition to serving the people of the Eastern \nDistrict as a courthouse, this building will stand as a reminder to the \ncommunity and people of California of the dedicated work of Judge \nRobert E. Coyle.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. OBAMA:\n  S. 969. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act with respect to \npreparation for an influenza pandemic, including an avian influenza \npandemic, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Attacking Viral \nInfluenza Across Nations Act of 2005, or the AVIAN Act.\n  The Nation is becoming increasingly aware of the very serious threat \nwe face from avian flu. This virus is found primarily in chickens, \nducks, and other birds. Despite major efforts to eradicate this virus, \nthe virus has become endemic in poultry and birds in some countries and \nis spreading rapidly in others. Humans can contract the virus when they \ncome into contact with infected birds, and when this happens, the \nconsequences are often deadly. Of the 88 humans infected with avian \ninfluenza in Vietnam, Thailand, and Cambodia, only 37 have survived.\n  Right now, avian flu is thought to only pass from birds to humans. \nHowever, doctors and scientists have expressed the very real concern \nthat this virus will mutate into a form that can spread easily from \nhuman to human. If this happens, the world could face its next \npandemic, which could cause more illness and death than virtually any \nother natural health threat.\n  The Nation experienced 3 pandemics in the 20th Century--the Spanish \nflu pandemic in 1918, the Asian flu pandemic in 1957, and the Hong Kong \nflu pandemic in 1968. The Spanish flu pandemic was the most severe, \ncausing over 500,000 deaths in the United States and more than 20 \nmillion deaths worldwide.\n  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has estimated \nthat up to 207,000 Americans could die, and up to 734,000 could be \nhospitalized during the next pandemic. The costs of the pandemic, \nincluding the medical costs and the costs associated with infected \nAmericans being unable to work and dying early, are estimated at \nbetween $71 billion and $166.5 billion. These costs do not include the \nimpact of a pandemic on commerce and society. On February 21, 2005, Dr. \nJulie Gerberding, Director of the CDC, discussed the possibility of a \npandemic and stated that ``this is a very ominous situation for the \nglobe . . . the most important threat that we are facing right now.''\n  We are in a race against time. The Nation's health officials have \nmade some progress in preparing for pandemic influenza. Yet, we have \nmuch work to do. The Department of Health and Human Services has not \nreleased its final pandemic preparedness plan nor have about half of \nthe states. A survey by the Association of State and Public Health \nLaboratory Directors found that 20 percent of States had no State \npublic health laboratory capacity to isolate viruses, and 25 percent \nreported no ability to subtype influenza isolates.\n  We know antivirals can prevent flu infection and treat those already \ninfected, but we have not stockpiled enough doses to cover even the \nhigh-risk populations. We need more research to improve the \neffectiveness and the safety of vaccines against avian flu and other \nstrains. Many of our hospital emergency rooms and clinics are already \nbursting at the seams, and it is unclear how they would care for a \ndramatically increased influx of patients during a pandemic.\n  The AVIAN Act is a comprehensive measure to deal with an influenza \npandemic by emphasizing domestic and international cooperation and \ncollaboration. It creates a high-level inter-agency policy coordinating \ncommittee tasked with creating an integrated plan for the nation, with \nattention to health, agriculture, commerce, transportation, and \ninternational relations. Similarly, states are required to finalize \npandemic preparedness plans that address surveillance, medical care, \nworkforce, communication, and maintenance of core public functions. \nPrivate health providers and hospitals will\n\n[[Page S4582]]\n\nplay a critical role in diagnosing and treating their patients for flu, \nand this bill provides grants to make sure their efforts and \ninformation networks are coordinated with those by the state. Health \nand veterinary officials are encouraged to work with our international \npartners on all of these initiatives.\n  This bill provides for a public education and awareness campaign and \nhealth professional training for a pandemic. The CDC is tasked with \nresearching communication strategies, and developing and implementing a \npublic, non-commercial, and non-competitive broadcast system. The NIH \nis required to expand and intensify its research on vaccines, \nantivirals, and other protective measures. An economics advisory \ncommittee is established to assess and make recommendations on how to \nfinance pandemic preparedness, while minimizing its economic impact.\n  Finally, the AVIAN Act provides for an Institute of Medicine study to \nstudy the legal, ethical, and social implications of pandemic \ninfluenza. Americans may be asked to isolate themselves, to stay home \nfrom work, to share their medical diagnoses, and to take certain \nmedications. All of these actions may be critical in preventing \nmillions of Americans from getting sick, spreading disease, and dying. \nYet, we must make sure that we are fully cognizant of how these \ndecisions will affect the rights of every American.\n  We face a terrible threat from pandemic avian influenza, and we must \nnot squander the opportunity before us to plan and prepare. In \nendorsing the AVIAN Act, the Trust for America's Health states: ``The \navian flu is a real and dangerous threat to the health to our nation \nand the world. If the virus mutates slightly, we could have a million \nAmericans hit by the first wave of a pandemic.''\n  The time to act is now, and I urge my colleagues to join me and pass \nthe AVIAN Act of 2005.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 969\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Attacking Viral Influenza \n     Across Nations Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Department of Health and Human Services reports \n     that an influenza pandemic has a greater potential to cause \n     rapid increases in death and illness than virtually any other \n     natural health threat.\n       (2) Three pandemics occurred during the 20th century: the \n     Spanish flu pandemic in 1918, the Asian flu pandemic in 1957, \n     and the Hong Kong flu pandemic in 1968. The Spanish flu \n     pandemic was the most severe, causing over 500,000 deaths in \n     the United States and more than 20,000,000 deaths worldwide.\n       (3) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has \n     estimated conservatively that up to 207,000 Americans would \n     die, and up to 734,000 would be hospitalized, during the next \n     pandemic. The costs of the pandemic, including the total \n     direct costs associated with medical care and indirect costs \n     of lost productivity and death, are estimated at between \n     $71,000,000,000 and $166,500,000,000. These costs do not \n     include the economic effects of pandemic on commerce and \n     society.\n       (4) Recent studies suggest that avian influenza strains, \n     which are endemic in wild birds and poultry populations in \n     some countries, are becoming increasingly capable of causing \n     severe disease in humans and are likely to cause the next \n     pandemic flu.\n       (5) In 2004, 8 nations--Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, \n     Japan, Laos, China, Cambodia, and the Republic of Korea--\n     experienced outbreaks of avian flu (H5N1) among poultry \n     flocks. Cases of human infections were confirmed in Thailand \n     and Vietnam (including a possible human-to-human infection in \n     Thailand).\n       (6) As of April 15, 2005, 88 confirmed human cases of avian \n     influenza (H5N1) have been reported, 51 of which resulted in \n     death. Of these cases, 68 were in Vietnam, 17 in Thailand, \n     and 3 in Cambodia.\n       (7) On February 21, 2005, Dr. Julie Gerberding, Director of \n     the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, stated that \n     ``this is a very ominous situation for the globe. . .the most \n     important threat we are facing right now.''.\n       (8) On February 23, 2005, Dr. Shigeru Omi, Asia regional \n     director of the World Health Organization (WHO), stated with \n     respect to the avian flu, ``We at WHO believe that the world \n     is now in the gravest possible danger of a pandemic.''.\n       (9) The best defense against influenza pandemics is a \n     heightened global surveillance system. In many of the nations \n     where avian flu (H5N1) has become endemic the early detection \n     capabilities are severely lacking, as is the transparency in \n     the health systems.\n       (10) In addition to surveillance, pandemic preparedness \n     requires domestic and international coordination and \n     cooperation to ensure an adequate medical response, including \n     communication and information networks, public health \n     measures to prevent spread, use of vaccination and \n     antivirals, provision of health outpatient and inpatient \n     services, and maintenance of core public functions.\n\n     SEC. 3. AMENDMENTS TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT.\n\n       Title XXI of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. \n     300aa-1 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n\n             ``Subtitle 3--Pandemic Influenza Preparedness\n\n     ``SEC. 2141.

Mr. President, it is my pleasure today to join the \nSenator from Utah, Mr. Hatch, and several of our colleagues in \nsponsoring the CLEAR ACT, a package of initiatives intended \nsimultaneously to lessen this Nation's dependence on foreign oil and to \npromote a cleaner environment.\n  Throughout my time in the Senate, and indeed going back to my time as \nGovernor of West Virginia, I have believed that the United States \nneeded to have a comprehensive and responsible national energy policy, \nand that a vital part of that policy should be promoting technologies \nand domestic resources to loosen the grip foreign suppliers of energy \nhave on our economy. Alternative fuels and alternative fuel vehicles \n(AFVs) that use them must be part of our energy policy. As a Senator, I \nhave been very interested in expanding the availability of alternative \nfuels and have worked with a number of my colleagues and experts in \nindustry, academia, and in the environmental movement on several \ninitiatives to accelerate their use and availability.\n  The current high price of gasoline drives home the point that we must \ndiversity our fuel supply. This issue is particularly important in West \nVirginia. Like many rural States, West Virginia has little public \ntransportation, and most people must drive, often considerable \ndistances, to work, to school, and to seek medical care. With every \ntrip to the gas station and nearly every evening news report, West \nVirginians are reminded that our country is in the midst of an energy \ncrisis. According to the American Automobile Association, the average \nprice of gasoline has risen 23 percent in the past year. These \nincreases have a serious impact on family budgets and on the economy in \ngeneral.\n  Today, more than 60 percent of the petroleum we consume is imported. \nThis adds to our economic problems and raises additional concerns about \nnational security. We must work to reduce the consumption, or at least \nthe growth in consumption, of petroleum-based fuels in the United \nStates. Emissions from gasoline-powered automobiles are a major source \nof air pollution and of carbon dioxide, which is the major contributor \nto global climate change. While I believe our energy policy should work \nin concert with a transportation policy that encourages the use of mass \ntransit, it is unlikely in the short-term that many West Virginians, or \na significant number of other Americans, will be able to greatly reduce \nthe amount they drive. The CLEAR ACT will help our Nation lessen its \ndependence on foreign oil and, because the amount Americans drive is \nlikely to increase, contribute to an overall cleaner environment by \nsubstituting cleaner-burning alternatives to gasoline and diesel.\n  In the development of alternative fuels and AFVs, our Nation has been \ncaught in what I've always thought of as the classic ``chicken and \negg'' problem. Both alternative fuels and AFVs must be commercially \navailable if the potential impact is to be achieved. Without the \nfueling infrastructure, wide commercial appeal of non-gasoline vehicles \nwill top out before the market has reached its potential. The \npopularity of gasoline-electric hybrids demonstrates the public's \nhunger for alternatives to the rapidly rising price of gasoline and \nincreasingly hazardous automobile emission. Appropriate tax incentives \ncan address the equally important challenges of vehicle availability \nand infrastructure deployment. If consumers routinely see alternative \nfuels at reasonable prices at their local service stations, while also \nseeing reasonably-priced vehicles at dealerships, we know they will \nrespond.\n  The CLEAR ACT provides the tax incentives that we need, and which I \nbelieve must be included in the comprehensive energy policy the Senate \nwill soon consider. In closing, let me thank my friends Senator Hatch \nand Senator Jeffords, with whom I've worked on this for many years. I \nam pleased as well to see that a growing number of my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle are joining us in this effort to improve our \nNation's energy, transportation, and environmental policy. I commend \nthis bill to the remainder of the Senate, and look forward to its \ninclusion in the Energy bill we will take up later in the year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Ensign, Mr. \n        Chafee, Ms. Collins, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Lieberman, \n        and Mr. Smith):\n  S. 971. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nencourage and accelerate the nationwide production, retail sale, and \nconsumer use of new motor vehicles that are powered by fuel cell \ntechnology, hybrid technology, battery electric technology, alternative \nfuels, or other advanced motor vehicle technologies, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the CLEAR ACT, \nthe Clean Efficient Automobiles Resulting from Advanced Car \nTechnologies Act of 2005. This bill passed the Senate as part of the \nomnibus energy bill last year, but unfortunately was not enacted.\n  Let me begin by thanking those who are cosponsoring this bill, namely \nSenators Rockefeller, Ensign, Chafee, Collins, Snowe, Jeffords, \nLieberman and Smith. And I know that a number of other senators will \nadd their names to this legislation in the near future. I appreciate \ntheir previous support and look forward to working with them to promote \nthe CLEAR ACT in this Congress.\n  The CLEAR ACT addresses two issues of critical national importance: \nour dependence on foreign oil; and air pollution. Ultimately, two-\nthirds of our oil use is consumed by the transportation sector, and \ntransportation in the United States is 97 percent dependent on oil. If \nwe are going to address our energy crisis, we have to address our \ntransportation fuels and vehicle use in a serious way.\n  I was very pleased that President Bush, yesterday, highlighted the \nneed to direct the automotive marketplace toward the widespread use of \nhybrid\n\n[[Page S4586]]\n\nand alternative fuel vehicles. The CLEAR ACT provides powerful market \nincentives to achieve that goal. It promotes the combination of \nadvances we must have in technology, infrastructure, and alternative \nfuels in order to bring fuel cell vehicles to a future mass market \nreality. Even if, in the end, hydrogen fuel cell vehicles prove \ninfeasible, the battery electric and alternative fuel technologies \npromoted by this bill will play a major role in improving our energy \nsecurity and our air quality. And we do so without any new federal \nmandates.\n  Currently, consumers face three basic obstacles to accepting the use \nof these alternative fueled and advanced technology vehicles. They are \nthe cost of the alternative fuel, the lack of an adequate \ninfrastructure of alternative fueling stations, and the incremental \ncost of alternative fuel vehicles. The CLEAR ACT attacks each of these \nobstacles head on, and it is crafted in a way to encourage the greatest \nsocial benefit possible for every tax dollar spent.\n  We need to find a way to lower those barriers to widespread consumer \nacceptance, which will in turn put the power of mass production to work \nto lower the incremental cost of these alternative technologies.\n  In short, our legislation would bring the benefits of cleaner air and \nenergy independence to our citizens sooner.\n  I have heard one or two senators ask why we need incentives to \npurchase hybrid vehicles when people are lining up to buy them today. \nIt is true that demand for these vehicles is high in a few areas. \nHowever, these high-demand areas tend to have local or state incentives \nin place for the purchase of the vehicles. Where incentives are not in \nplace, hybrid sales are minimal. This demonstrates that incentives can \nindeed provide a market breakthrough to consumer acceptance of \nalternatives vehicles. With the CLEAR ACT we are trying to provide that \nbreakthrough on a national scale.\n  In 2004, hybrid vehicles made up only 0.48 percent of light weight \nvehicle sales. That's far short of where we need to be as a nation to \nmake a dent in our energy crisis, but at least it's a start.\n  Air pollution is an issue of critical concern in my home State of \nUtah. While Utah has made important strides in improving air quality, \nit is a fact that each year we increase the number of vehicular miles \ndriven in our State and mobile sources are the main cause of air \npollution in Utah.\n  It is clear that if we are to have cleaner air, we must encourage the \nuse of alternative fuels and technologies to reduce vehicle emissions.\n  The CLEAR ACT will help us do just that.\n  I am very proud to offer this ground-breaking and bipartisan \nlegislation.\n  It represents the input and hard work of a very powerful and \neffective coalition--the CLEAR ACT Coalition. This coalition includes \nthe Union of Concerned Scientists, the Natural Resource Defense \nCouncil, Environmental Defense, the Alliance to save Energy, Ford Motor \nCompany, Toyota, Honda, the Natural Gas Vehicle Coalition, the Propane \nVehicle Council, the Methanol Institute, the Electric Drive \nTransportation Association, and others. The CLEAR ACT reflects the \nuntiring effort and expertise of the members of this coalition, and for \nthis we owe them our gratitude.\n  I urge my colleagues in the Senate to join us in this forward-looking \napproach to cleaner air and increased energy independence.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN:\n  S. 972. A bill to designate the Albuquerque Indian Health Center as a \ncritical access facility and to provide funds for that Center; to the \nCommittee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President. I am introducing important legislation \nto address a crisis in the delivery of health care at the Albuquerque \nIndian Health Center, or AIHC, which provides critical primary, urgent, \nand oral health care services to more than 30,000 urban Indians living \nin the Albuquerque area.\n  The Albuquerque Indian Health Center serves a large urban population \nwith an inadequate funding base and provides contract health care \nfunding for a significant portion of the urban Indian population. About \n50 percent of the base appropriation to the Albuquerque Service Unit \ngoes to Tribes who are delivering their own health care services. \nHowever, for AIHC, the demand has not decreased due to the constant \nunderfunding of IHS, and AIHC now receives more than $5 million less \nthan it did just a few years ago.\n  As a result, AIHC is running a severe deficit and the Indian Health \nService, or IHS, has directed AIHC to begin the process of a reduction \nin force, or RIF, that will result in a significant downsizing of \nclinical personnel and the closure of the urgent care unit which sees \nan estimated 120 patients a day.\n  After the RIF is completed, only two physicians will remain available \nto provide services for more than 30,000 Native Americans who utilize \nAIHC as their primary care provider.\n  To address this problem, I am introducing legislation today that is \ncalled the ``Albuquerque Indian Health Center Act of 2005'' and would \ndesignate AIHC as a ``critical access facility'' for the region with \nadditional funding of $8 million to address the shortfall and allow \nAIHC to be restored as a comprehensive ambulatory care center for urban \nIndians in the region.\n  Prior to the introduction of this legislation, I have individually \nand jointly with the entire New Mexico congressional delegation made \nappeals to the Indian Health Service and to Department of Health and \nHuman Services Secretary Mike Leavitt to use any authority they have to \ntransfer funding to AIHC to alleviate this critical problem. \nCongressman Udall and I also sent a letter to Governor Bill Richardson \non ways that we can work together with the State to improve the \nsituation at AIHC.\n  I ask unanimous consent that these letters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 15, 2004.\n     Dr. Charles Grim,\n     Director, Indian Health Services, U.S. Department of Health \n         and Human Services, Rockville, MD.\n       Dear Dr. Grim: I recently had the opportunity to meet with \n     the CEO of the Albuquerque Indian clinic and other IHS staff. \n     It was alarming to hear that the roughly 23,000-25,000 urban \n     Native Americans that currently access their health care at \n     the Albuquerque Indian Health Center (AIHC) are at risk of \n     losing this access because the AIHC is experiencing \n     significant budget shortfalls. Since 1998, the AIHC has had \n     to significantly reduce services from a 24 hour-7 day a week \n     operation down to Monday through Friday 8:00 am-4:30 pm. \n     Access to services that concentrated on diabetic care, \n     behavior health and eye care has been severely restricted.\n       The AIHC is projecting a $5 million deficit for fiscal year \n     2005. The current FY 2005 operations budget (hospital and \n     clinic funds) is about $5.4 million, yet current FY 2005 \n     expenses are estimated at $10 million. Moreover, \n     approximately $4 million of the $5.4 million is still subject \n     to tribal transfer through Public Law 93-638. Indian Self-\n     Determination Act. In an attempt to avoid a large deficit and \n     prepare for future transfers of funds from IHS to tribes, \n     AIHC officials have been forced to make a decision to \n     immediately reduce current services and downsize clinical \n     personnel.\n       It is my understanding that beginning on January 1, 2005 \n     the AIHC will be closing its urgent care services unit. It is \n     estimated that 100-120 Native American patients are seen on a \n     daily basis through urgent care. With nearly 70% of the \n     25,000 Native American users of the AIHC uninsured, IHS \n     estimates that this closure will put 17,000 urban Native \n     Americans at risk of losing access to healthcare services. \n     Furthermore, I have been informed that a second phase has \n     been proposed which will be to downsize the number of \n     physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and other allied personnel. \n     The annual 90,000 visits will be cut to 30,000, thus \n     decreasing third party billing by more than two thirds. The \n     AIHC anticipates that once the downsizing is complete, at \n     best, there will be two physicians onsite, Monday through \n     Friday, 8:00 am to 4:30 pm, who absolutely will not have the \n     capacity to provide services to 25,000 urban Native \n     Americans.\n       I am asking that you consider reprogramming FY 2005 funding \n     increases in the amount of $13 million to the AIHC. $5 \n     million will be needed to first stabilize services and the \n     remaining $8 million will then be used to increase services. \n     The $13 million is based on ``Level of Need Funding'' \n     criteria established by the IHS in 2002 to address 60% of the \n     needs of Native American population.\n       I appreciate your time and consideration of this matter. \n     Should you have any questions or require further information \n     please feel free to contact Bruce Lesley in my Washington DC \n     office at 202-224-5527 or Danny Milo in my Albuquerque office \n     at 505-346-\n\n[[Page S4587]]\n\n     6601. I look forward to working on a positive solution to \n     this with you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senator.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 22, 2004.\n     Dr. Charles W. Grim, D.D.S., M.H.S.A.,\n     Director, Indian Health Service, Rockville, MD.\n       Dear Dr. Grim: We are writing in support of the request by \n     the Albuquerque Service Unit to shift funding within IHS to \n     the Albuquerque Indian Health Center (AIHC) and to seek \n     funding from other sources within HHS.\n       The AIHC provides health care services to about 25,000 of \n     the 47,000 urban Indians living in Albuquerque, including \n     primary, urgent, and dental care. Because of a projected \n     deficit of $5 million in Fiscal Year 2005 and substantial \n     deficits in years thereafter, the urgent care center is set \n     to close on February 1, 2005. Without additional funding, \n     urban Indians in the Albuquerque metro area will lose access \n     to the AIHC for urgent care forcing them to visit non-IHS \n     facilities in the community or not seek urgent care when \n     needed. It is estimated that at least 17,000 urban Indians in \n     Albuquerque utilize urgent care services at the AIHC each \n     year.\n       The current FY 2005 AIHC operations budget is about $5.4 \n     million, yet FY 2005 expenses are estimated at $10 million \n     with the current level of services. About $4 million of the \n     $5.4 million budget is still subject to tribal share transfer \n     through Public Law 93-638, the Indian Self-Determination Act. \n     In an attempt to avoid a large deficit and to prepare for \n     future transfers of funds from IHS to tribes, AIHC officials \n     made the decision to close the urgent care center and \n     downsize clinical personnel beginning February 1.\n       Since 1998, the AIHC has had to significantly reduce \n     services from a 24-7 operation down to Monday through Friday \n     8:00 AM to 4:30 PM. Access to services that concentrated on \n     diabetic care, behavioral health, and eye care has been \n     severely restricted. With the recent announcement of the \n     impending closure of the urgent care unit, walk in/same day \n     appointments wil1 no longer be accepted and patients will be \n     required to have an appointment to access outpatient \n     services. Since the positions of 40 physicians, nurses, \n     pharmacists, and staff will be eliminated, the availability \n     of appointments will be restricted due to the limited number \n     of physicians remaining. This will cause delays in treatment \n     and compromise the health of individuals. While we are asking \n     for a short-term influx of available dollars to keep the \n     urgent care center open, the gradual dwindling of services \n     provided at the AIHC is a systemic problem that must be \n     addressed.\n       The 2000 census showed that about 60% of all Indians live \n     off of tribal land. Urban Indian health, however, only \n     comprises about 1% of the IHS budget. The deficit of the AIHC \n     is indicative of a much larger problem, a general deficiency \n     in funding for urban Indian health. We look forward to \n     working with you to address this larger problem. Our long-\n     term goal is to secure a stable, reliable, and adequate \n     funding stream to the AIHC to fully meet the health care \n     needs of the urban Indian population in Albuquerque. Any \n     suggestions you have to help us meet this goal would be \n     appreciated.\n       The financial stability of the Albuquerque Indian Health \n     Center and affiliated health clinics are vitally important to \n     providing access to health care for Indians, particularly \n     urban Indians in Albuquerque, and for the broader health care \n     system in our community. We look forward to your response in \n     this urgent matter.\n           Sincerely,\n     Pete V. Domenici,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n     Jeff Bingaman,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n     Heather Wilson,\n                                               Member of Congress.\n     Tom Udall,\n                                               Member of Congress.\n     Steven Pearce,\n     Member of Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n                                          Department of Health and\n\n\n                                               Human Services,\n\n                                  Rockville, MD, January 21, 2005.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: I am responding to your December 15. \n     2004, letter regarding the Albuquerque Indian Health Center. \n     The Albuquerque Service Unit is in a unique situation. It \n     serves a large urban population with a minimal funding base \n     and provides contract health care funds for approximately 30 \n     percent of the urban population, including eligible Navajo \n     patients. This is compounded by the transfer of approximately \n     50 percent of the base appropriation to Tribes in the service \n     unit who are administering their own health care delivery \n     programs. To meet these fiscal constraints, the service unit \n     and the Albuquerque Area Indian Health Service (IHS) must \n     deliver care based on the funds available; unfortunately, \n     this requires the downsizing of the health services program \n     and a reduction-in-force.\n       Reprogramming IHS funds is not viable for two reasons. \n     First, there arc no contingent funds available in our Agency. \n     Second, reprogramming appropriations for Tribal health to a \n     largely urban population requires a mechanism to transfer \n     these funds to Title V of Public Law 94-437 for urban \n     Indians. This would necessitate extensive Tribal \n     consultation, which would be very time-consuming and not meet \n     the immediate need.\n       I have directed the Albuquerque Area Office and Service \n     Unit to: (1) downsize and implement the reduction-in-force; \n     (2) maximize their efforts to increase third-party revenue at \n     the service unit, including developing alternate billable \n     services; (3) work with the State of New Mexico and other \n     agencies and Tribes to develop alternatives to care for the \n     large metropolitan population in Albuquerque; and (4) discuss \n     fiscal support from the Navajo Area IHS. I am confident that \n     the Area Office and the service unit will explore all \n     opportunities to provide the highest quality health care to \n     this population.\n       Thank you for your concern and your continued support of \n     our efforts to provide quality health care to our Indian \n     people.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                 Charles W. Grimm,\n                                                           D.D.S.,\n     Assistant Surgeon General, Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                          Department of Health and\n\n\n                                               Human Services,\n\n                                  Rockville, MD, January 21, 2005.\n     Hon. Heather Wilson,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Ms. Wilson: I am responding to your December 22, 2004; \n     letter supporting the need for funds to continue services at \n     the Albuquerque Service Unit. I agree that short-term support \n     is needed, but more importantly, a long-term solution to meet \n     the health needs of a rapidly growing ``urban'' population in \n     the Albuquerque metropolitan area is a more complex issue.\n       The Albuquerque Indian Hospital has undergone several \n     changes in the scope of services. The number of inpatient \n     beds was reduced. Inpatient services were suspended and \n     evening and weekend clinics were eliminated. We are also \n     planning to limit services to appointments only with a \n     minimal number of hours for non-appointed services (``walk \n     ins'') and to initiate a substantial reduction-in-force \n     (RlF). These changes have been the result of the transfer of \n     over 60 percent of the hospital's Federal funds to Tribal \n     programs under Public Law (P.L.) 93-638 and an increase in \n     the number of uninsured patients residing in the Albuquerque \n     metropolitan community.\n       The hospital needs a minimum of $5 million to maintain \n     services through this fiscal year. Permanently reprogramming \n     the IHS appropriation is not a viable option because of \n     limited funds throughout our system to deliver health care \n     services. The transfer of funds that may be available for \n     Tribal shares under P.L. 93-638 to support services to a \n     largely urban population would require extensive, time-\n     consuming Tribal consultation. The Albuquerque Area Office \n     has presented to the members of the University of New Mexico \n     (NM) Clinical Operations Board, the possibility of a \n     partnership among the University of NM Health Sciences \n     Center, the State of NM, the Tribes, and the IHS Area. This \n     concept is currently being discussed with Tribal and State \n     officials and leaders in the Albuquerque metropolitan Indian \n     community.\n       Mr. James L. Toya, Director, Albuquerque Area IRS, will \n     continue to explore all opportunities for resource \n     development, plan downsizing services at the Albuquerque \n     Hospital, and implement the RIF. In addition, local \n     partnership agreements are currently being developed.\n       Thank you for your concern and continued support to our \n     efforts to provide quality health care to our Indian people.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                 Charles W. Grimm,\n     D.D.S., Assistant Surgeon General, Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 2, 2005.\n     Mr. Michael O. Leavitt,\n     Secretary, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Leavitt: During our recent meeting in \n     December, I had the opportunity to talk to you about the \n     crisis that the Albuquerque Indian Heath Center (AIHC) is \n     currently facing. The AIHC provides healthcare services to \n     roughly 23,000-25,000 urban Native Americans. Unfortunately, \n     there is a projected $5 million deficit for FY05. I have \n     recently been informed by Dr. Charles Grim that he has \n     directed the Albuquerque Area office and service unit to \n     downsize and implement a reduction in force. (RIF).\n       Since 1998, the AIHC has had to significantly reduce \n     services from a 24 hour 7-day a week operation to Monday \n     through Friday 8:00 am-4:30 pm. Because of the \n     administration's under funding of IHS, once again, the AIHC \n     is being forced to ``downsize'' its operations which will \n     have significant effect on the urban Indian population. This \n     downsizing will force the AIHC to close its urgent care unit, \n     which sees an estimated 100-120 Native American patients a \n     day. With nearly 70% of the 25,000 Native American users of \n     the AIHC uninsured, this closure will cause 17,000 urban \n     Indians to lose access to their healthcare services. \n     Furthermore, last week the Indian Health Service took its \n     first steps toward their reduction in force which will result \n     in the elimination of 40 position at the AIHC. There are \n     currently 140 employees at the center of whom only 14 are \n     physicians. It is my understanding that 5 of these 14 \n     physicians will be ``RIFed'' which will leave the AIHC with \n     only 9 physicians (4 family practice, 2 pediatricians, and 4 \n     specialists) to treat an estimated population of 23,000-\n     25,000 patients.\n       On December 15, 2004 I sent a letter to Dr. Grim asking him \n     to consider reprogramming\n\n[[Page S4588]]\n\n     FY05 funding in the amount of $13 million. Of this $5 million \n     would be used to stabilize services and the remaining $8 \n     million would be used to increase services. Dr. Grim \n     responded to my letter saying that ``reprogramming IHS \n     funding is not viable'' due to the fact that ``there are no \n     contingent funds available to our Agency.'' I am now \n     requesting that you consider reprogramming Department of \n     Health and Human Services (HHS) funds to Indian Health \n     Service in the same amount for the specific purpose of \n     treating the urban Indian population through the Albuquerque \n     Indian Health Center.\n       It is important for Department of Health and Human Services \n     to understand and acknowledge that urban Indians throughout \n     the country are falling through the cracks and that urban \n     Indian clinics are being grossly underfunded. For many years \n     there has been a quiet migration of Indians from reservations \n     to cities. In fact more Native Americans live in cities now, \n     making it important that IHS programs cater to Indian Country \n     which extends beyond borders of the reservations and into \n     urban settings. According to a study done by the Kaiser \n     Family Foundation ``about 46% of IHS resources are allocated \n     to IHS facilities, 53% to tribally operated facilities, and \n     only 1% to urban Indian programs''. These numbers clearly \n     indicate that urban IHS facilities lack the financial \n     resources necessary to carry out their services.\n       Nationwide there are an estimated 1.6 million federally-\n     recognized Native Americans through IHS, as well as Tribal \n     and urban Indian health programs. Of this number, the 2000 \n     census data reveals that a little over half this population \n     identify the themselves as living in metropolitan/urban \n     areas, in which Albuquerque has the 7th highest urban Indian \n     population. A recent U.S. Commission on Civil Rights (USCCR) \n     report estimates that the Department of Health and Human \n     Services (HHS) per capita health spending for all Americans \n     is at $4,065, while IHS spent about $1,914 per person and \n     average spending on Navajo patients is $1,187. The United \n     States Government has historical and legal responsibility to \n     provide adequate healthcare for the Native American \n     population and ensure that access to these services are not \n     lost; with these cuts and drastic under funding the \n     government is shirking its responsibility.\n       Thank you for your prompt consideration of this matter. \n     Should you have any questions or require further information \n     please feel free to contact Bruce Lesley in my Washington, DC \n     office at 202-224-5527 or Danny Milo in my Albuquerque office \n     at 505-346-6601. I look forward to working with you on \n     finding a solution to this matter. Best wishes.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senator.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               Secretary of Health\n\n\n                                           and Human Services,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 24, 2005.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: I enjoyed our discussion a few \n     months ago, and am pleased to respond to your letter \n     regarding the reduction in available funding for the \n     Albuquerque Indian Health Center (AIHC) in Albuquerque, New \n     Mexico.\n       I share your concerns regarding the impact of reducing \n     staff and services at the AIHC. The AIHC has experienced \n     funding decreases in recent years due to Tribes exercising \n     their rights under the Indian Self-Determination and \n     Education Assistance Act (ISDEAA) to operate their own health \n     programs. Under the ISDEAA, the IHS is required to transfer \n     dollars from services it provides directly to eligible \n     American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) to Tribes which \n     apply, and are approved, to compact or contract for services \n     they provide to their members. The Department of Health and \n     Human Services does not have authority to reprogram funds \n     from other appropriation accounts to the Indian Health \n     Services account where the AIHC is funded.\n       I assure you the IHS continues to partner with other \n     community providers in the Albuquerque area to maximize all \n     resource opportunities for AI/ANs who may still use the \n     center's services. Options being explored include: continued \n     provision of same day appointments, increased collaboration \n     with the University of New Mexico and the Salud managed care \n     organization to enroll more patients in the ``University of \n     New Mexico Cares'' program, maximizing third party \n     collections by increasing access to individuals who may be \n     eligible for Medicaid or Medicare, and improving \n     transportation options to other IHS funded facilities. \n     Additional options for the Albuquerque Indian community \n     include applying for other HHS grant programs including the \n     Health Resources and Services Administration's (HRSA) Sec. \n     330 Community Health Center Program grants, and exploring the \n     Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration's (SAMHSA) \n     grant opportunities. I want to assure you that HHS staff will \n     provide technical assistance in the grant application process \n     to potential grantees.\n       I am hopeful that these options will result in significant \n     assistance to AI/ANs in the Albuquerque area. Thank you for \n     your concern and continued support of HHS efforts to provide \n     quality care to American Indians and Alaska Natives. Please \n     call me if you have any further thoughts or questions.\n           Sincerely,\n     Michael O. Leavitt.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   March 15, 2005.\n     Hon. Bill Richardson,\n     Governor of New Mexico,\n     State Capitol, Santa Fe, NM.\n       Dear Governor Richardson: As you are aware, the Albuquerque \n     Indian Health Center (AIHC) is facing a crisis that threatens \n     the health and well-being of 23,000 urban Indians in \n     Bernalillo County and surrounding areas. Although there have \n     been a number of efforts that we have supported to increase \n     the Indian Health Service (IHS) budget, those efforts have \n     been defeated in the Congress during the past few years. \n     Consequently, funding for the AIHC has dropped from $13 \n     million to just $5 million in recent years.\n       Although New Mexico's congressional delegation is working \n     together to secure a solution at the federal level, we wanted \n     to encourage you to have your Administration help AIHC in the \n     interim to improve third-party collections.\n       For example, as an IHS facility, care delivered to Medicaid \n     beneficiaries at AIHC is reimbursed with 100% federal \n     financing. Thus, we would ask that the Human Services \n     Department (HSD) work closely with Maria Rickert, Chief \n     Executive Officer of AIHC, to determine if: (1) Medicaid \n     reimbursement for services delivered by AIHC could be \n     improved; (2) the State Medicaid program can do more with \n     respect to providing for eligibility workers at AIHC; and, \n     (3) there are other options to help AIHC address its funding \n     problem and protect critical health services for the urban \n     Indians in the Albuquerque area.\n           Sincerely,\n     Jeff Bingaman,\n                                                      U.S. Senator\n     Tom Udall,\n     U.S. Representative.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              State of New Mexico,\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                                   April 25, 2005.\n     Hon. Pete V. Domenici,\n     U.S. Senator, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Heather Wilson,\n     Member of Congress, Cannon House Office Building, Washington, \n         DC.\n     Hon. Steve Pearce,\n     Member of Congress, Longworth House Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senator, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Tom Udall,\n     Member of Congress, Longworth House Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Domenici and Bingaman and Representatives \n     Wilson, Udall and Pearce: Thank you for your recent letters \n     expressing your concerns regarding the Albuquerque Indian \n     Healthcare Center (AIHC). Clearly, we all share the same \n     commitment to improve the delivery of health care services to \n     our Native American constituencies. Therefore, I hope that \n     you will strongly advocate for increased funding for the \n     Indian Health Service (IHS) during the appropriations \n     process.\n       Providing adequate healthcare services to our Native \n     American citizens is a federal responsibility yet the Indian \n     Health Service (IHS) has only received minimal increases in \n     funding, such as a mere 2 percent increase this year. \n     Properly funding the IHS ensures that the Native American \n     population in New Mexico as well as across the country \n     receives the vital healthcare services to which they are duly \n     entitled.\n       On the State level, my administration has committed \n     resources to address the healthcare needs of Native \n     Americans. Unfortunately, the New Mexico Legislature did not \n     pass House Bill 521 this past session, letting it sit idle \n     after passage in its first committee. However, I signed into \n     law nearly $2 million in funding for Native American \n     healthcare projects in New Mexico, including the construction \n     of healthcare facilities in Indian Country, the provision of \n     ambulatory services in Albuquerque, and healthcare services \n     at UNM Hospital for Native American patients.\n       In addition my administration has provided the following \n     support, which includes but is not limited to:\n       The New Mexico Human Services Department (NMHSD) through \n     the Medical Assistance Division is providing outreach to \n     eligible Native American children to get them enrolled with \n     Medicaid.\n       NMHSD is providing valuable technical assistance to the \n     AIHC through training and billing resources in order to \n     maximize Medicaid reimbursement. After working with AIHC and \n     reviewing the Medicaid claims, it was determined that there \n     are no outstanding claims and AIHC is receiving reimbursement \n     at the maximum level possible as an outpatient facility.\n       The State Coverage Initiative has been funded in New Mexico \n     and will be implemented effective July 1, 2006. It may be \n     possible for AIHC to receive payments for services provided \n     to this population.\n       During the State fiscal year 2004, there were 4,549 \n     American Indian Medicaid recipients in the fee-for-service \n     program who received outpatient services at AHIC for a total \n     reimbursement of about $2 million dollars. Sixty-five percent \n     of those recipients were under 21 years of age.\n       The Presumptive Eligibility/Medicaid On-Site Application \n     Assistance (PE/MOSAA)\n\n[[Page S4589]]\n\n     program has worked well for Indian communities. PE/MOSAA \n     certified workers are located at IHS and tribal health care \n     facilities, tribal schools, and other tribal health and \n     social services departments and with NMHSD's Income Support \n     Division offices.\n       As a pilot project, NMHSD recently stationed an eligibility \n     worker at the Gallup Indian Medical Center. As a regional \n     referral center, the Gallup Service Unit (including Tohatchi \n     Health Center, and Ft. Wingate Health Center) provides \n     services to about 800 patients per day.\n       New Mexico cannot nor should not bear sole responsibility \n     for funding healthcare services that fall within the ambit of \n     the federal trust relationship with Indian tribes and \n     pueblos. To this end, I appreciate your collective efforts to \n     garner support on the federal level to keep AIHC afloat.\n       I also appreciate Senator Bingaman's efforts to address \n     these issues in his legislation that would fulfill the \n     funding needs for AIHC as well as clarify the 100 percent \n     match in Medicaid for urban Indians. I suggest that you \n     direct your staff to review the Bingaman legislation and \n     strongly consider supporting his efforts to assist the AIHC \n     and urban Indians.\n       If I can assist the Congressional Delegation in its efforts \n     to advocate for increased federal funding for IHS and \n     specific assistance for AIHC please do not hesitate to call \n     upon me. Again, thank you for your letters and I look forward \n     to working with all of you to improve and expand health care \n     services to our Native American residents in New Mexico.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Bill Richardson,\n     Governor.\n                                  ____\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Included in that is a statement by Governor Richardson \nexpressing his strong support for the legislation I am introducing \ntoday.\n  Unfortunately, the options that Secretary Leavitt outlined in his \nresponse will only provide limited help in alleviating this crisis. It \nis for that reason that I introduce this emergency funding legislation \ntoday.\n  Fundamentally, while AIHC does face a unique situation because the \nAlbuquerque metro area has experienced a significant increase in its \nurban Indian population from surrounding tribes and individuals from \ntribes across the Nation, the most significant underlying problem is \nthat the entire Indian Health Service is horribly underfunded.\n  In fact, funding for Native American health care is a national \ntravesty. Over the years, funding for IHS has not kept pace with \nmedical inflation and population growth As a result, IHS services are \nseriously underfunded, and patients are routinely denied care. For many \ncritical services, patients are subjected to a literal ``life or limb'' \ntest; their care is denied unless their life is threatened or they risk \nimmediate loss of a limb. Care is denied or delayed until their \ncondition worsens and treatment is costlier or, all too often, comes \ntoo late to be effective. Federal per capita funding for Indian health \nis only $1,914, about half the allotment of Federal per capita funding \nfor health care for Federal prisoners.\n  Former HHS Secretary Tommy Thompson traveled to the Navajo \nReservation last year and saw this problem first-hand and vowed to \nfight for increased funding for tribal health care. Unfortunately, the \nadministration has proposed a rather modest increase of less than 2 \npercent for IHS in fiscal year 2006. Yet again, IHS funding will not \ncome close to keeping pace with medical inflation which is growing at \ndouble-digit levels in the private sector.\n  On a per capita basis, it is even worse because HHS's own budget \ndocuments indicate that IHS will have to serve over 29,000 new people. \nFurthermore, although urban Indians represent around half of all Native \nAmericans in the country, urban Indian health programs receive less \nthan 1 percent of all IHS funding and those funds are literally frozen \nat $33 million nationwide.\n  This is both unacceptable and unsustainable.\n  In addition to supporting budget and appropriations amendments time-\nand-time again over the years that unfortunately have failed in Senate \nvotes, including an amendment by Senator Conrad to the budget \nresolution this year, I successfully offered amendments last session of \nCongress to the Medicare prescription drug bill to provide Indian \nHealth Service units to get better prices through the contract health \nservices program and to allow IHS to bill for the full array of \nservices in the Medicare program.\n  In the coming weeks, I will also be introducing two pieces of \nlegislation to both improve health services generally for urban Indians \nand to also improve the delivery of health care for Native Americans in \nthe Medicaid and State Children's Health Insurance Program, or SCHIP.\n  In the short-term, however, we need passage of this critical and \nurgent legislation to save the health services provided by the \nAlbuquerque Indian Health Center that are being threatened. I urge its \nimmediate passage.\n  I ask for unanimous consent to print a copy of the legislation in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 972\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Albuquerque Indian Health \n     Center Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. CRITICAL ACCESS FACILITY FUNDING.\n\n       (a) Definition of Critical Access Facility.--In this \n     section, the term ``critical access facility'' means a \n     comprehensive ambulatory care center that provides services \n     on a regional basis to Native Americans in Albuquerque, New \n     Mexico, and surrounding areas.\n       (b) Designation.--The Albuquerque Indian Health Center \n     (also known as the ``Albuquerque Indian Hospital'') is \n     designated as a critical access facility.\n       (c) Operations.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services, acting through the Indian Health Service, shall \n     provide funds made available under subsection (d) to the \n     Albuquerque Indian Health Center to carry out the operations \n     of that Health Center.\n       (2) Self-determination contracts.--The funds transferred \n     under paragraph (1) shall not be distributed to any Indian \n     tribe under section 102 of the Indian Self-Determination and \n     Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450f).\n       (d) Funding.--\n       (1) In general.--On October 1, 2005, out of any funds in \n     the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, the Secretary of the \n     Treasury shall transfer to the Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services to carry out this section $8,000,000, to remain \n     available until expended.\n       (2) Receipt and acceptance.--The Secretary shall be \n     entitled to receive, shall accept, and shall use to carry out \n     this section the funds transferred under paragraph (1), \n     without further appropriation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Mr. Obama):\n  S. 973. A bill to establish the Abraham Lincoln National Heritage \nArea, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to submit legislation along \nwith my colleague, Senator Barack Obama, to establish the Abraham \nLincoln National Heritage Area in Illinois.\n  Illinois has long been known as the ``Land of Lincoln.'' Reminders of \nthe 16th President's legacy can be found throughout the State.\n  Last week, Senator Obama and I attended the dedication of the Abraham \nLincoln Presidential Library and Museum in Springfield, IL. This \nwonderful new facility brings together the entire story of President \nLincoln's life in a rich, unified experience.\n  In the same spirit, our legislation would establish an Abraham \nLincoln National Heritage Area, formally tying together the many \nIllinois natural, historic, cultural and recreational resources that \nhave been touched by the life and influence of the Nation's greatest \nPresident. Establishing a Lincoln National Heritage Area will connect-\nthese scattered elements to provide a more cohesive experience of \nLincoln's legacy for Illinoisans and visitors alike.\n  The impact of the life and works of Illinois's favorite son extends \nfar beyond the prairies of the Midwest.\n  Not long ago, I sat in the United States House of Representatives and \nlistened as the new president of Ukraine, the leader of his nation's \npeaceful Orange Revolution, spoke of his countrymen and women's dreams \nto live under a ``government of the people, for the people.''\n  Just weeks before that, I was in the Green Zone in Baghdad and heard \nan official of the new Iraqi Government quote President Lincoln on the \nneed for national unity.\n  In a sense, the Land of Lincoln is anywhere that people dream of \nfreedom and equality and opportunity for all.\n  So the whole world would benefit, as the people of Illinois work to \npreserve Lincoln's history. And we invite the world to come to Illinois \nand learn not just about the history of this great\n\n[[Page S4590]]\n\nman, but also about what he can teach us today.\n  The Abraham Lincoln National Heritage Area will help spread that \nmessage for generations to come, to Americans, and to students of \nAbraham Lincoln everywhere on Earth.\n  This bill is the Senate companion to legislation introduced by \nRepresentative Ray LaHood and endorsed by every member of the Illinois \ncongressional delegation in the House of Representatives, as well as \nrepresentatives from every part of the country.\n  Senator Obama and I ask our colleagues to join with us in recognizing \nthe richness of the Lincoln legacy by supporting the passage of this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LIEBERMAN (for himself, Mr. Hatch, and Mr. Brownback):\n  S. 975. A bill to provide incentives to increase research by private \nsector entities to develop medical countermeasures to prevent, detect, \nidentify, contain, and treat illnesses, including those associated with \nbiological, chemical, nuclear, or radiological weapons attack or an \ninfectious disease outbreak, and for other purposes; read the first \ntime.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, Senator Hatch, Senator Brownback and I \nare pleased to introduce today the Project BioShield II Act of 2005.\n  This is the fourth bill I have introduced on this subject, and the \nthird with Senator Hatch as my lead cosponsor. We are delighted today \nto be joined by Senator Brownback, a leading advocate for research to \ncure deadly tropical diseases.\n  None of us on the Hill--especially those of us with offices in the \nHart Building--will forget October 15, the date of the anthrax attack \non Senator Daschle's office. This date is the bioterrorism equivalent \nof September 11. We also need to remember October 5, the third \nanniversary of the 2001 anthrax death of Bob Stevens, a photo editor at \nAmerican Media in Boca Raton, Florida, and November 17, the third \nanniversary of the discovery of a similar anthrax laced letter mailed \nto Senator Leahy. Similar anthrax attacks during these weeks were \ndirected at NBC, ABC, CBS and other news organizations. All told five \npeople died and thousands who might have been exposed were put on \nCipro, including many of us and many of our staff.\n  This attack on civilians with weapons grade anthrax was unprovoked. \nAnd unlike the case with the 9/11 attacks, we still don't know who \nmailed the anthrax letters. As with the 9/11 attacks, we were totally \nunprepared for the anthrax-laced letters. We are responding forcefully \nto the 9/11 attacks--the commission that Senator McCain and I proposed \nhas issued a superb report and the Government Affairs Committee, where \nI serve as the Ranking Democrat, is hard at work translating its \nrecommendations into legislation. Unfortunately our response to the 10/\n15 anthrax attack has not been as forceful.\n  Unlike our response to 9/11, we have not seemed to consider the 10/15 \nattack to be the equivalent of a declaration of war. While we have \ntaken a few constructive steps to strengthen our Bioterror defenses, we \nremain painfully vulnerable to another Bioterror attack, or a chemical \nor radiological attack.\n  Many of us believe that enactment of BioShield I, last July, is a \nstep in the right direction, but we don't believe that BioShield is \nsufficient. If we listen carefully, we will hear that the biopharma \nindustry--which is hiding on this issue--is saying that BioShield is \nnot enough. So we already have strong warning signs that more needs to \nbe done.\n  There is no terror threat greater than that of Bioterror. With an \nattack with a plane, a chemical attack or a radiological dispersion \ndevice, dirty bomb, the loss of life can be catastrophic, but the \nperimeter of the attack is fixed. With an infectious disease, the \nperimeter of an attack might grow exponentially as the infection \nspreads. It is possible to kill thousands with a bomb, chemical or \nradiation, but it is possible to kill millions with a bioterror \npathogen.\n  In the 2001 anthrax attack, the terrorist wrote a note in the letter \nto Senator Daschle that said, ``09-11-01. You can not stop us. We have \nthis anthrax. You die now. Are you afraid? Death to America. Death to \nIsrael. Allah is great.'' If this note had not been included in the \nletter, and if the intern who opened the letter hadn't been suspicious, \nit is possible that some Senators and many Capitol Hill staff from our \noffices--perhaps hundreds--might have died. We would only have \ndiscovered the attack in hospital emergency rooms, where Cipro might \nhave proven to be ineffective. Cipro works as a prophylaxis only when \nit catches anthrax early, before the toxins are released into the \nbloodstream, which can happen within 24 hours of an infection. Our \ncurrent anthrax vaccine is administered in six shots over 18 montns.\n  The 9/11 Commission report states that al-Qaida ``was making advances \nin its ability to produce anthrax prior to Sept. 11'' and cited former \nCIA Director George Tenet as warning that an anthrax attack is ``one of \nthe most immediate threats the U.S. is likely to face.'' Russia \ndeveloped dozens of strains of anthrax and the security at these former \nbioweapons laboratories is suspect. It is estimated that a mason jar of \nanthrax spores sprayed over an urban area could infect 400,000 \nresidents, and if undetected until they started showing up in emergency \nrooms, kill half of them. It is also estimated that one hundred anthrax \nlaced letters could cross contaminate thirty million letters and infect \n10,000 people with anthrax. Imagine what would happen if our mail \nsystem--which processed over 200 billion pieces of mail last year--were \nclosed for a few months. What we need, and don't yet have, is a \ntherapeutic that disarms the anthrax toxins at a late stage of the \ndisease--which is the aim of a pending RFP at the Department of Health \nand Human Services.\n  We saw the potential for morbidity and mortality, and massive \neconomic disruption, with SARS. When SARS was rampant, Beijing, Hong \nKong and Shanghai closed down. Quarantines were imposed and China \nauthorized the death penalty on anyone who willfully spread the \ndisease. During the epidemic, there were reports that the SARS virus \nwas mutating to become more virulent. In China's countryside, fear of \nSARS has led to some villages setting up roadblocks to keep away people \nfrom Beijing and at least four riots against quarantine centers have \nbeen reported in recent days. Thousands were quarantined in China. In \nthe end SARS spread to thirty countries on five continents, sickening \nnearly 9,000 and killing 850. SARS is a zoonotic disease that \napparently can jump back and forth between animals and man, which makes \nit much more difficult to eradicate it. We may not have seen the last \nof it.\n  We can also remember the devastating impact of the 1918 Spanish flu \npandemic that killed more than died in the first World War, about 30-40 \nmillion people equivalent to 100 million today. In the month of \nOctober, 1918, 200,000 Americans died of the disease, 43,000 soldiers \ndied, and 28 percent of our population was infected. The flu's \nlethality rate was only 2.5 percent the lethality rate of the most \ncommon form of smallpox, variola major, is 30 percent and for \nhemorrhagic smallpox it approaches 100 percent. The lethality rate \nfor SARS was about 15 percent. If the 1918 flu pandemic killed the \nequivalent of 100 million people, think of how many smallpox or SARS--\nboth of which could be weaponized by terrorists--could kill.\n\n  Public health authorities are concerned about the incidence of avian \ninfluenza in humans. There is now concrete evidence that this virus can \nbe transmitted human-to-human. When humans contract the pathogen from \nbirds, the death rates are very high; a majority die. Since January \n2004, a total of 23 confirmed human cases of avian influenza virus \ninfections have been reported in Vietnam with 19 deaths and 12 cases in \nThailand with 9 deaths. These cases were associated with widespread \nH5Nl poultry outbreaks that occurred at commercial and small backyard \npoultry farms. Since December 2003, nine countries have reported H5Nl \noutbreaks among poultry. More than 100 million chickens have been \nculled in an effort to stop the outbreak. The virus now appears to be \nable to infect mammalian hosts, including pigs and cats, an unusual \nprowess for an avian virus. This raises concern as pigs are also hosts \nof human flu viruses and this could yield\n\n[[Page S4591]]\n\na hybrid avian flu strain that can be passed human-to-human. The avian \nflu virus apparently is now carried by migratory birds so it may be \nvery difficult to eradicate the virus. We have no vaccine for the \ndisease and the one therapeutic Tamiflu--is only effective if given \nvery early after the onset of symptoms. It is feared that the virus \nmight evolve resistance to Tamiflu. Public health officials believe \nthat in theory the avian flu could cause a ``pandemic killing millions \nof people worldwide, and possibly hundreds of millions.'' Whether H5N1 \ncould be used as a Bioterror weapon against agriculture or humans is \nnot known.\n  In 1947 there was an outbreak of smallpox in New York City. \nEventually two of the twelve who were infected died. But the smallpox \nvaccination campaign was massive 500,000 New Yorkers received smallpox \nvaccinations the first day and eventually 6.35 million were vaccinated \nin less than a month, 85 percent of the city's population. President \nTruman was vaccinated prior to a trip to New York City.\n  If we suffered another smallpox outbreak, it is not likely that a \nvaccination campaign would go so smoothly. It is now estimated that if \nthe current smallpox vaccine were deployed in the United States 350 to \n500 individuals might die from complications. The current vaccine is \nnot recommended for patients who have eczema or are immunosuppressed, \nHIV-positive or are pregnant. Even worse, based on a 1971 accidental \nrelease of smallpox from a Soviet bioweapons laboratory, some speculate \nthat the Soviets successfully weaponized a rare and especially lethal \nform of smallpox, hemorrhagic smallpox, with near 100 percent \nlethality.\n  Mother Nature's pathogens are dangerous--smallpox, anthrax, plague, \ntularemia, glanders, typhus, Q fever, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, \nbrucellosis, botulinum toxin, dengue fever, Lassa fever, Russian \nspring-summer encephalitis, Marburg, Ebola, Bolivian hemorrhagic fever, \nArgentinean hemorrhagic fever and fifty other pathogens could kill \nthousands or even millions. But on the horizon are more exotic and \ndeadly pathogens.\n  We have reports that the Soviet Union developed genetically modified \npathogens such as a hybrid plague producing diphtheria toxin. This \nmanipulation increased virulence and made the plague microbe more \nresistant to vaccine. Other possibilities include a Venezuelan equine \nencephalomyelitis-plague hybrid is a combination of the virus and \nbacteria; we have no idea what symptoms such a pathogen would manifest \nor how we might diagnose or treat it. Other hybrid pathogens might be \ndeveloped, including a Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis-Ebola \nhybrid.\n  We have reports that the Soviet Union developed a powdered Marburg, a \nhemorrhagic fever where every cell and organ of the victim bleeds. \nSymptom of Marburg include kidney failure, recurrent hepatitis, \ninflammation of the spinal cord, bone marrow, eyes, testes, and parotid \ngland, hemorrhaging into the skin, mucous membranes, internal organs, \nstomach, and intestines, swelling of the spleen, lymph nodes, kidneys, \npancreas, and brain, convulsions, coma and amnesia.\n  Genetically modified pathogens are another possibility. In 2001 the \nJournal of Virology reported that Australian scientists seeking to \ncreate a contraceptive for mice used recombinant DNA technology to \nintroduce Interleukin 4 into mousepox and found that it created an \nespecially virulent virus. In the words of the scientists, ``These data \ntherefore suggest that virus-encoded IL-4 not only suppresses primary \nantiviral cell-mediated immune responses but also can inhibit the \nexpression of immune memory responses.'' This public research suggests \nthat introducing IL-4 can create an Andromeda stain of a virus, \ninformation of potential use to terrorist sociopaths. In addition, \npublished studies describe how to create a recombinant vaccina virus to \ninduce allergic encephalomyelitis in rabbits, and potentially--highly \nlethal smallpox virus capable of causing paralyses in humans and how to \nsynthesize the polio virus in a biochemical laboratory .\n  Other possible pathogens--some of which the Soviet worked on--include \nantibiotic resistant pathogens. The Soviets apparently developed a \nstrain of plague resistant to ten different antibiotics, and a strain \nof anthrax resistant to seven different antibiotics. Some claim the \nSoviets developed a strain of anthrax resistant to the current U.S. \nanthrax vaccine. A part of this research in a hamster model was \npublished in ``Vaccine'' so this information is available to \nterrorists.\n  Other exotic pathogens might include autoimmune peptides, antibiotic \ninduced toxins, and bioregulators and biomodulators. An autoimmune \npeptide might stimulate an autoimmune attack against the myelin that \nsheaths the target's nerve cells. Antibiotic induced toxins are hybrid \nbacteria-viruses where antibiotics administered to treat the bacterial \ninfection stimulate the virus to release a deadly toxin; the greater \nthe doses of antibiotics, the more toxins are released. Bioregulators \nand biomodulators are synthetic chemical that bond to and disrupt \nreceptors that govern critical functions of the target, including \nnerve, retinal, liver, kidney, heart, or muscle cells to cause \nparalysis, blindness, schizophrenia, coma, or memory loss.\n  Some of these might be available now from the 60 bioterror research \nlaboratories maintained by the Soviet Union. Eventually, terrorists \nmight be able to set up full-blown biotechnology laboratories. Rogue \nstates could do so and they might then transfer bioweapons to \nterrorists or lose control of them. Over the long term, as the power of \nmodern biotechnology grows, the bioterror threat will grow and \nincreasingly virulent and exotic weapons might become threats.\n\n  In November 2003 the CIA's Office of Transnational Issues published \n``Our Darker Bioweapons Future,'' which stated that the effect of \nbioengineered weapons ``could be worse than any disease known to man.'' \nThe rapid evolution of biotechnology makes monitoring development \nofbioweapons extremely difficult. Some ofthese weapons might enable the \ndevelopment of ``a class of new, more virulent biological agents \nengineered to attack distinct biochemical pathways and elicit specific \neffects, claimed panel members. The same science that may cure some of \nour worst diseases could be used to create the world's most frightening \nweapons.'' It specifically mentioned the possibility of ``binary BW \nagents that only become effective when two components are combined (a \nparticularly insidious example would be a mild pathogen that when \ncombined with its antidote becomes virulent)''; ``designer'' BW agents \ncreated to be antibiotic resistant or to evade an immune response; \nweaponized gene therapy vectors that effect permanent change in the \nvictim's genetic makeup; or a ``stealth'' virus, which could lie \ndormant inside the victim for an extended period before being \ntriggered.\n  Illustrating the speed with which biotechnology is advancing to \ncreate new bioterrorism threats is a recent announcement by Craig \nVenter and his Institute for Biological Energy Alternatives that in \nfourteen days they had synthetically created working copies of the \nknown existing bacteriophage virus Phi X174. Other researchers had \npreviously synthesised the poliovirus, which is slightly bigger, \nemploying enzymes usually found in cells. But this effort took years to \nachieve and produced viruses with defects in their code. So the \ntimescale has shifted from years to weeks to make a virus. There are \nother bigger viruses that would require more time to assemble. Venter \nasserts that his team could make a bacteria with about 60 times larger \ngenome from scratch within about a year of starting. Does this mean \nthat the debate about whether to destroy smallpox virus stocks is \npointless because any virus or bacteria whose DNA sequence is published \nis eventually going to be easily creatable by labs all around the \nworld?\n  These pathogens might be deployed by terrorists, sociopaths or rogue \nstates that have no compunctions about killing massive numbers of \n``infidels'' or enemies in the west. They would experience great joy in \nsowing widespread panic, injury and death in America. Osama Bin Laden's \nspokesman, Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, bragged that al Qaeda has ``the right \nto kill 4 million Americans'' in response to deaths he claims the west \nhas inflicted on Muslims. We are facing sociopaths with no compunction \nabout using\n\n[[Page S4592]]\n\nwhatever weapons of mass destruction they can develop or secure. They \nwould see the potential to unleash a weapon in North America and trust \nthat our borders would be closed so that it would only rage here and \nnot spread to the Muslim world.\n  The Brookings Institution estimated that a bioterror attack would \ncause one million casualties and inflict $750 billion in economic \ndamage. An earlier Office of Technology Assessment found that there \nmight be three million casualties. If there are this many casualties, \nwhat can we expect in the way of public panic and flight? A 2004 poll \nfinds that ``most Americans would not cooperate as officials would \nexpect them to during a terrorism incident.'' Only 2/5 said that they'd \n``follow instructions to go to a public vaccination site in a smallpox \noutbreak'' and only 3/5 would ``stay in a building other than their own \nhome . . .'' A vivid vision of what an attack might look like is found \nin Albert Camus' The Plague, with its incinerators and quarantine \ncamps. We can review the history of the Black Death, which killed up to \none half of Europe's population between 1348 and 1349.\n  Imagine what would happen if the attack involves a pathogen for which \nwe have no diagnostic, vaccine or therapeutic. If we resorted to \nquarantines, what would the rules of engagement be for the police and \nmilitary forces we deploy to enforce it? Would it be possible to \nestablish an effective quarantine if there is mass panic and flight? \nWould our hospitals be overwhelmed by the ``worried well'' ? Would \npublic health workers continue to serve or also flee? If our hospitals \nare contaminated, where would Americans receive medical care for non-\nterror related emergencies?\n  What would happen if a bioterror, chemical or radiological attack \nclosed Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport--which handled nearly \neighty million passengers last year? Or what would happen if we put a \nhold on the one hundred and twenty million international airline \narrivals and departures we see each year? What would happen if we were \nforced to close our borders with Mexico and Canada--with 500 million \ncrossings last year? What would happen if we restrained the 2.79 \ntrillion automobile passenger miles driven in the U.S., one billion of \nwhich exceeded 100 miles?\n  What would happen if a terror attack rendered certain types of \nbusiness activity uninsurable? What will happen if large swaths of \nresidential real estate--none of which is currently insured for acts of \nterror--were contaminated and rendered worthless with anthrax spores?\n  We are vulnerable to a bioterror attack in many ways, but one of the \nmost troubling is that we have essentially none of the diagnostics, \ntherapeutics and vaccines we need to treat those who might be exposed \nor infected. If we don't have these medicines, we are likely to see \nquarantines and panic, which will amplify the damage and disruption. My \noffice is on the 7th floor of the Hart Building, immediately above \nSenator Daschle's office. We were told if we immediately started a \ncourse of treatment with Cipro we would not die, so there was no panic. \nThink what would have happened if the government had said, ``We don't \nknow what this is, it's deadly, we have no way to tell who has been \nexposed, and we have no medicines to give you.''\n  In the summer of 2000 the Defense Science Board found that we had \nonly one of the fifty-seven diagnostics, drugs and vaccines we most \nneed to respond to a bioterror attack, we had a therapeutic for \nchlamydia psittaci, a bacteria. It projected that we'd have twenty of \nthe fifty-seven within 5 years and thirty-four within 20 years. But \ntoday we have only two of the fifty-seven countermeasures, we now have \na diagnostic for anthrax.\n  At this rate of developing these medical countermeasures, we won't \nhave twenty of them available until 2076 and we won't have thirty-four \nuntil 2132. This list does not include antibiotic resistant pathogens, \nhybrid pathogens, genetically modified pathogens, and a host of other \nexotic bioterror pathogens.\n  The Congress administration have not responded to the anthrax attack \nwith an appropriate sense of urgency, especially with regard to the \ndevelopment of medicines. We have not responded with a crash industrial \ndevelopment program as we did when we developed radar during the Second \nWorld War or as we are now undoubtedly undertaking to detect roadside \nbombs. Reluctantly, I would characterize our national response as \nlackadaisical.\n  December 4 is the third anniversary of my introduction of legislation \nto provide incentives for the development of medical countermeasures--\nincluding diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines--for bioterror \npathogens, S. 1764. Chairman Hatch, October 17 is the second \nanniversary of our introducing our first bill together on this subject, \nS. 3l4, and we introduced our current bill on March 19 of last year (S. \n666). Twenty months ago President Bush proposed Project BioShield, a \nbill based on one of the twelve titles in our bills, and it was finally \nenacted into law on July 21. If we enact one of the titles of our bill \nevery two years, it'll take 22 more years to complete our legislative \nwork.\n  The critical issue for this hearing is whether Project BioShield, \nPublic Law 108-276, is sufficient or whether we need to supplement it \nwith BioShield II, a bill that you and I intend to introduce this Fall. \nBioShield is only one title of our proposal--the title that provides \nthat the government will define the size and terms of the market for a \nBioterror countermeasure in advance before a biopharma company puts its \nown capital at risk. This is a necessary first step; companies won't \nrisk their capital to develop a product unless they can assess the \npossible rate of return, product sale on their investment.\n  Enacting BioShield is a step in the right direction. If we were to \nenact only one idea first, this is the right first step. We will now \nsee how the Department of Health and Human Services implements this \nlaw. We will see what R priorities it sets, whether it projects a \nmarket for these products sufficiently large to engage the better \nbiopharma companies in this research, and whether it sets contract \nterms that company Chief Financial Officers find acceptable.\n  Unfortunately, we all heard a deafening silence from biopharma \nindustry--the target of this legislation--as BioShield was being \nconsidered. The industry did essentially nothing to fix the \nAdministration's draft--which the industry privately stated was laced \nwith dysfunctional provisions. The industry did essentially nothing to \npass BioShield. And the industry has said essentially nothing since \nBioShield was enacted.\n  It is clear to me that BioShield is not sufficient to secure \ndevelopment of the medical countermeasures we need, indeed, I believe \nit is woefully insufficient.\n  The industry is skeptical that the government will be a reliable \npartner during the development bioterror countermeasures. The basis of \nits skepticism runs deep.\n  The industry points to the Cipro procurement as a case in point. In \n1999, before the anthrax attack, Bayer, the developer of Cipro, was \nasked by FDA and CDC to secure a label indication for Cipro for \nanthrax. The government wanted to have one antibiotic available that \nwas explicitly labeled for anthrax--it understands that patients might \nbe reluctant to take a medicine for anthrax where it is not labeled for \nthis indication. Bayer incurred the expenses to do this with no \nexpectation of ever utilizing the product in this manner, and when the \nattack occurred, Cipro was the only therapeutic with a label indication \nfor anthrax. Bayer handled this emergency with honor. It immediately \ndonated huge stocks of Cipro, 2 million tablets to the Postal Service \nand 2 million tablets to the Federal government to be used to protect \nthose who might have been exposed or infected. The government then \nsought to procure additional stocks of Cipro and demanded that Bayer \nsell it as one-fourth the market price. Threats were made by Members of \nCongress that if Bayer would not agree to this price the government \nmight step in to challenge the patent for Cipro. Bayer readily agreed \nto the deep discount. We can assume that every other purchaser of Cipro \nthen demanded this same price and that this cut Bayer's market return \nfor Cipro. To add insult to injury, Bayer has had to defend itself from \nlawsuits by those who took Cipro in response to the attack even though \nit did what was asked, provided more than enough free product to treat\n\n[[Page S4593]]\n\nall patients and greatly reduced it's stockpile pricing. Bayer also was \ndeeply concerned with employee and plant security risks when it was \npublicly identified as the sole source of this counter-bioterrorism \nagent.\n  The industry view this incident as proving that with regard to \nbioterrorism research, no good deed will go unpunished. If a large \npharmaceutical company can be manhandled this way, what would happen to \na small biotechnology company? The industry expects that if there is an \nattack, and the company has the indispensable medicine we need to \nrespond to it, the government is likely to steal the product. The \nindustry is deeply skeptical of the government already. It has very \ncomplex and often contentious relationships with other HHS agencies, \nincluding the Center for Medicare Services, the Food and Drug \nAdministration, and the National Institute of Health. It has constant \nbattles with state Medicaid agencies. This is not an industry that \ntrusts government.\n  Some in Congress have proposed legislation that feed industry fears. \nIn 1994 and 1995 legislation was introduced in the House, H.R. 4370, \nintroduced on May 10, 1994, and H.R. 761, introduced on January 31, \n1995, that provided the government with eminent domain power with \nregard to AIDS to confiscate ``all potential curatives and all data . . \n. regarding their development,'' including the patents for such \ncompounds. Similarly, in 1999 and 2001 legislation was introduced in \nthe House, H.R. 2927, introduced on September 23, 1999, and H.R. 1708, \nintroduced on May 3, 2001, that provided for the compulsory licensing \nof ``any subject invention related to health'' where the government \nfinds it ``necessary to alleviate health or safety needs'' or the \npatented material is ``priced higher than may be reasonably expected \nbased on criteria developed by the Secretary of Commerce.'' Legislation \nhas been introduced that would deny the benefits of the R tax credit \nfor research by pharmaceutical companies where the products that arise \nfrom that research are sold at higher prices abroad than in the United \nStates. See H.R. 3665 introduced on February 15, 2000.\n  The industry response to these threats to its patents must be seen in \nlight of the events of March 14, 2000. On that day a White House \nspokesman apparently indicated that the government might move to \nchallenge some biopharma industry patents for genes. The industry lost \n$40 billion in market capitalization in the panic that ensued on Wall \nStreet. That was not only the beginning of a deep drought in biotech \ncompany financing, it was the beginning of the collapse of the entire \nNASDAQ market. A similar collapse and drought had occurred in 1993-1994 \nthe Clinton Administration proposed that the prices of ``breakthrough \ndrugs would be reviewed by a special government panel.''\n  The issue of price controls and patents was recently considered and \nrejected by NIH in response to a petition for the government to march-\nin on the patent of Abbott Laboratories for ritonavir, sold under the \nname of Norvir, an AIDS therapeutic. The petitioner, Essential \nInventions, asked that the government cancel the license of this patent \nto Abbott, which it alleged was charging too much for Norvir. The \npetitioner had also been involved in the 1994-1995 NIH proceeding, \nwhere NIH reviewed the impact of its 1989 protocol to review whether \n``reasonable'' prices were being charged by companies that had licenses \nwith NIH. NIH found that this price review process was destroying the \nNIH technology transfer program--companies simply would not enter into \nagreements with NIH. As a result, NIH repealed the price review \nprocess. The new march-in petition raised essentially the same issues \nand if the petition had been granted, we could have expected that the \nNIH tech transfer process will be crippled--again, as it was from 1989-\n1995. In rejecting the petition, NIH did not state, however, that is \nhas no right to march-in based on the price of a product, implying that \nit could or might assert such power in the future. This can only have a \nchilling impact on companies considering entering into biodefense \nprocurement and research agreements.\n  Aside from fears about government actions, we could not have picked a \nworse time to ask the industry to undertake a whole new portfolio of \nresearch. The biotech NASDAQ index stood at 1380 and it now stands at \nabout 725. The Amex biotech index peaked at 801 and it now stands at \nabout 525. The Dow Jones pharmaceutical index peaked at 420 and it now \nstands at about 275. The biotech industry raised $32 billion in capital \nin 2000 and only $16 billion last year. In June of this year, 36 \npercent of the public biotech companies had stock trading at less than \n$5 per share. There were 67 biotech IPOs in 2000 and only 7 last year. \nThe industry losses each year continue run to $4 billion. The National \nVenture Capital Association reports that only 2 percent venture money \nwent into biodefense following the October anthrax attack.\n  Of the 506 drugs publicly disclosed to be under development by the 22 \nlargest pharmaceutical companies, only 32 are for infectious disease \nand half of these are aimed at HIV/AIDS. In 1967 we had 67 vaccine \ncompanies and in 2002 we had 12. World wide sales vaccines is about $6 \nbillion, but the world wide sales of Lipitor are $10 billion.\n  In addition, it is not clear whether the government is able or \nwilling to provide the industry with the operating margins--profits--it \nsees for its other products. The operating margin for successful \nbiopharma companies is 2.76 to 3.74 times as great as the operating \nmargins for major defense contractors. This means that the defense \ncontractor model will not work to engage biopharma companies in \ndeveloping medical countermeasures for bioterror agents. Whether the \nsuccessful bipharma companies are ``too profitable'' is a separate \nissue. The issue addressed here is the operating margin that successful \nbiopharma companies seek and expect as they assess lines of research to \nundertake. If the operating margin for biodefense research is less, or \nsubstantially less than the operating margin for non-biodefense \nresearch, it is not likely that these companies will choose to \nundertake biodefense research. This research is a voluntary undertaking \nputting their capital at risk; there is no requirement that they do \nthis when the prospects for profits are not competitive with that from \nother lines of research.\n  Mostly we are seeing the industry hiding, not commenting on the \npending legislation, not participating in the legislative process, and \nmaking every effort not to seem to be unpatriotic or greedy. Companies \ndo not say in public that they are disinterested. They will not say \nwhat package of incentives would be sufficient to persuade them to take \nup biodefense work. They fear a debate on patents. They feel besieged \nby the current drug import debate, pressure from CMS over drug prices, \nand the debate over generic biologics. While I understand these fears, \nwe simply have to know what it would take in the way of incentives to \nestablish a biodefense industry. If the incentives in BioShield or \nBioShield II are not sufficient, we need to know what incentives are \nsufficient. We need to know what reassurances would persuade the \nindustry that what happened to Bayer will never happen again. And only \nthe industry can give us a clear answer to these questions. We cannot \nhave a dialogue on these urgent national questions without the \ngovernment listening and the industry speaking.\n  The goal of BioShield II is to shift the risk of countermeasure \nresearch and development to the industry. Given the skepticism of the \nindustry about the reliability of the government as a partner, shifting \nthe risk to the industry--with it risking its own capital to fund the \nR be difficult. But engaging the industry as entrepreneurs, \nrather than as defense contractors, is likely to be less expensive for \nthe government and it's much more likely to secure the development of \nthe medicines that we need.\n\n  If the Government funds the research, the industry can expect to \nreceive the operating margins that are typically paid to defense \ncontractors--8.5-9 percent. If the industry risks its own capital and \nfunds the failures and cost overruns, the industry believes it would be \njustified demanding the operating margins that are typically paid in \nthe commercial sector--28-32 percent.\n  If the Government funds the research, the industry expects that the \ngovernment will control or own the patents associated with the \nmedicines. If the industry funds the research, it\n\n[[Page S4594]]\n\nbelieves it has claims on all the patents.\n  The only companies that are likely to accept a defense contractor \nmodel are companies with no approved products, no revenue from product \nsales, and no other source of capital to keep the lights on. For them \nGovernment funding is ``non-dilution'' capital, meaning it's a form of \ncapital that does not dilute the ownership shares of its current \nshareholders. Many biotech companies have stock trading in the low \nsingle digits, so they cannot issue another round of stock that would \nenrage the current shareholders. For them this Government funding might \nvalidate the scientific platform of the company, generate some revenue, \nand hype the stock.\n  Biotech industry executives state in private that if their capital \nmarkets strengthen they will be even less likely to consider bioterror \ncountermeasure research. One CEO whose company has received an NIH \ngrant for bioterror countermeasure research stated in private that his \ncompany would never have considered this entanglement with the \nGovernment if it had any other options to fund its research.\n  Our goal with BioShield IT should be to engage the successful \nbiopharma companies in this research--companies that have brought \nproducts to the market--and persuade them that the Government will be a \nreliable partner. Then the risk of failure and cost overruns is shifted \nto the industry and we've engaged the companies with a track record of \nbringing products to the market. The Government will need to provide \nsubstantial rewards if--and only if--the companies do succeed in \ndeveloping the medicines we need, but then the Government is only \npaying for results. When the Government funds the research, it funds a \nprocess with no guarantees of any success. Providing the industry with \nsubstantial rewards for success is a model that engages the industry as \nentrepreneurs, drawing on the greatest strength our Nation has in the \nwar on terror.\n  Our bill addresses a critical question: who is in charge for \nGovernment if there's a mass casualty event and how do they lead the \nmultifaceted response. The legislation sets up an interagency board to \nmap out and develop the response to such an event and places a new \nAssistant Secretary Chief Medical Officer at the Department of Homeland \nSecurity as its chair. In addition, the new Assistant Secretary would \nlead the DHS assets and resources as part of this effort. While this \nproposal is the result of discussions with some of the experts in this \narea, we recognize there may be different points of view about the \noptimal structure for the medical response capabilities within DHS and \nthe proposed structure in this bill is open to further discussion. I \nlook forward to working with the chairman of the Senate Homeland \nSecurity and Government Affairs Committee, Senator Collins, and others \nin exploring these complex issues. On these issues, this bill is a \ndiscussion draft.\n  We should not need a 9/11 Commission report to galvanize the \nadministration and the Congress to respond to the unprovoked and deadly \nbioterror attacks of 3 years ago. The threat could not be more obvious \nand what we need to do is also obvious. If we don't develop the \ndiagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines to protect those who might be \nexposed or infected, we risk public panic and quarantines. We have the \nworld's preeminent biopharma industry and we need to put it to work in \nthe national defense.\n  BioShield I is a step in the right direction, but it is a small step \nthat does not take us where we need to go. We need to follow the \nimplementation of BioShield very carefully and set clear metrics for \ndetermining its effectiveness. We should not wait to begin to review \nthe policy options available to supplement BioShield. Senator Hatch and \nI will be proposing BioShield II and we will press for its \nconsideration. We should press the biopharma industry to present its \nviews on what it will take to engage it in this research and what it \nwill take to establish a biodefense, research tool, and an infectious \ndisease industry.\n  The American philosopher, George Santana said, ``Those who cannot \nremember the past are condemned to repeat it.'' It's only been 3 years \nsince the anthrax attack but I fear our memory of it already has faded. \nLet this hearing stand as a clear statement that some of us in the \nCongress remember what happened and are determined not to permit it to \nhappen again. War has been declared on us and we need to act as if we \nnoticed.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, more than 3 years ago, our country suffered \nthe most deadly attack ever on our soil. We woke up on the morning of \nSeptember 11, 2001 to a new reality.\n  A month later, we again realized the magnitude of the ever-changing \nthreat we were facing when the Senate Hart Office Building was \ncontaminated with anthrax and was closed for three months.\n  Most Americans were shaken out of their sense of complacency in 2001.\n  As many will recall, after 9/11, Congress took action to secure our \nborders, our ports, and our airlines and bolster our public health \ninfrastructure.\n  Yet, it is important to note that the key steps necessary to protect \nour country against the continuing threat of bioterrorism are still \nbeing carefully reviewed and revised.\n  And while these steps are being evaluated, time is running out. Even \nyesterday, we heard news reports that al-Qaida is planning attacks on \nour country through chemical plants within the next five years.\n  While Congress took an important step when the Project BioShield Act \nof 2004 was signed into law last July, I believe that much more still \nneeds to be done.\n  That is why I am once again joining my good friend and colleague, \nSenator Joe Lieberman, in introducing this bipartisan bill. I am proud \nto have been Senator Lieberman's primary partner on this legislation \nover the past several years.\n  Indeed, we are pleased that some key concepts contained in our \nearlier bills, such as the guaranteed market, have been adopted by the \nadministration and our colleagues in Congress.\n  In the last congress, the Senate Judiciary Committee held a joint \nhearing with the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pension Committee \nto determine what priorities should be included in the follow-on \nlegislation, the Bioshield II bill, and to raise awareness on what else \nneeds to be done in order to combat bioterrorism. It is clear that we \ndo need to continue our efforts, and that is why I will continue to \npush for action on this legislation until the bill is signed into law \nby the President.\n  It is well known that terrorists are specifically interested in using \nbiological weapons, such as those produced in the Soviet Union before \nits collapse.\n  Some experts believe that Soviet scientists were able to develop \nsmallpox strains that were universally lethal.\n  Some believe they developed a strain of Black Plague that is \nresistant to 10 different antibiotics.\n  Today, it is unclear where some of these former Soviet scientists are \nworking and, even more disturbing, it is not clear if these bioterror \nagents are still in the former Soviet Union.\n  As new varieties of biological weapons are developed, the threat of \nanother attack becomes a very real possibility. Again, that is why \nSenator Lieberman and I strongly believe that Congress needs to act on \nthe Liberman-Hatch legislation immediately.\n  Over 4 years ago, Congress instructed the executive branch to perform \na bioterrorism exercise to determine our Nation's state of preparedness \nagainst a bioterror threat.\n  In May 2000, a bioterrorism exercise was initiated and the naturally \noccurring plague bacterium, Yersinia Pestis, was theoretically \nunleashed in Denver. In that exercise, one antibiotic that is available \nto the public was used to combat the bioterrorism plot and treat the \ninfected individuals.\n  I believe that this exercise needs to be conducted again--a more \nrealistic scenario would be one in which no effective treatment is \navailable.\n  To me, that is the more realistic and threatening scenario.\n  There are already numerous diseases where no actual cure exists, \nwhere all the clinicians can do is to support the patient and hope that \nthey survive. We need to focus our efforts on improving our ability to \ncare for these illnesses, as they are currently very attractive weapons \nto our enemies.\n  Even as we continue to invest resources to build up a prepared public \nhealth infrastructure, we must also develop medicines to threat those \nwho\n\n[[Page S4595]]\n\nare exposed or infected. Otherwise, we will be forced to impose \nquarantines, just as our ancestors did in times of pestilence, and we \nwill surely find it as difficult a proposition as they did. \nQuarantining hundreds, maybe even hundreds of thousands of people \nwould, obviously, be extremely difficult to manage.\n  Developing ways to prevent, detect, and treat dangerous pathogens \nmust be a priority for our Nation so that we do not face these dreadful \nscenarios.\n  Our best defense against bioterrorism is a full medicine chest. We \nmust develop medicines to treat the naturally occurring biologic \nagents, and, in addition, we need to develop medicines to treat \nbacteria and viruses that have been genetically manipulated as weapons \nto cause death or injury to human beings.\n  Therefore, the biopharma companies must be engaged in these \ndiscussions because they will play an integral role.\n  Our bill, BioShield II, is the next step in the legislative process \nto ensure bioterror readiness.\n  We cannot afford to wait. Every day that we sit idle, we encourage \nour enemies to move forward.\n  We must abandon business-as-usual and take vigorous steps to protect \nour Nation, our communities, our citizens and our industries from \nfuture bioterrorist attack, especially given the implication of further \nattacks on the United States.\n  BioShield II encourages Congress to take vital steps to protect our \nNation through an array of intellectual property, tax, procurement, \nresearch, liability, and other incentives to ensure the creation of a \nrobust biodefense industry.\n  Direct government funding can only go so far.\n  To be effective, we must also enact incentives so that potential \ninvestors will want to fund the research associated with building a \nstrong and flexible defense against potential attacks.\n  But to accomplish this goal, we must unleash the creative genius of \nthe biopharma industry to work with us on these solutions.\n  Bioshield II will encourage biopharma companies to take the lead in \nthe development of vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics to combat \nbioterrorism. These efforts will also help protect our Nation against \nnaturally occurring diseases. In fact, a major improvement in this bill \nis that we allow the array of incentives to be employed against \ninfectious diseases and as well as disease prevalent in the developing \nworld.\n  All research on infectious disease is interrelated. SARS, HIV, \nmalaria, and avian and pandemic flue are chilling reminders that our \npublic health system must be able to take on all comers; it is not just \ndeliberately engineered agents that threaten us.\n  Our infrastructure--our researchers, our pharmaceutical industry, our \nhospitals, and our caregivers--must be prepared and equipped to fight \nillness, wherever and however it occurs. By expanding the scope of \ncovered research under this bill, we may also discover cures for \ndiseases that afflict the world's poorest nations.\n  The goal of our legislation is to have a safer and better prepared \nAmerica. But, to do this we must provide researchers and investors with \nthe proper incentives. Forming unprecedented and vigorous partnerships \nwith these companies is the key. Otherwise, this endeavor will never \nwork and the American public will remain at great risk.\n  The harsh reality is that nearly 4 years after 9/11, we have not \ndeveloped one significant bioterrorism countermeasure.\n  Aside from vaccines for smallpox and anthrax--both of which have \ntheir own downsides--and a handful of antibiotics and anti-infectives--\nalso with their own array of strengths and weaknesses--the cupboard is \nbare.\n  This is simply not acceptable.\n  As new varieties of bioterror weapons are developed, the threat of \nanother attack comes ever-closer to our shores. For this reason, \nSenator Lieberman and I are introducing the ``Project BioShield II Act \nof 2005''.\n  We plan to work closely with all interested members of Congress, \nincluding Senator Burr, Senators Enzi and Kennedy, chairman and ranking \nDemocratic member of the HELP Committee respectively, Senators Grassley \nand Baucus, chairman and ranking Democratic member of the Finance \nCommittee, Senators Specter and Leahy, chairman and ranking Democratic \nmember of the Judiciary Committee; and Senator Collins, chairman of the \nSenate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.\n  We will work closely with all the relevant officials in the Bush \nadministration; and we will work with Senate Leadership and with all \ninterested parties in the House.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this very important \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/28/senate-section/article/S4595-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4595-S4596]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 128--DESIGNATING APRIL 30, 2005, AS ``DIA DE LOS \n      NINOS: CELEBRATING YOUNG AMERICANS'', AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES\n\n  Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Grassley, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. \nMartinez, and Ms. Murkowski) submitted the following resolution; which \nwas submitted and read:\n\n                              S. Res. 128\n\n       Whereas many nations throughout the world, and especially \n     within the Western hemisphere, celebrate ``Dia de los \n     Ninos'', or ``Day of the Children'' on the 30th of April, in \n     recognition and celebration of their country's future--their \n     children;\n       Whereas children represent the hopes and dreams of the \n     people of the United States;\n       Whereas children are the center of American families;\n       Whereas children should be nurtured and invested in to \n     preserve and enhance economic prosperity, democracy, and the \n     American spirit;\n       Whereas Hispanics in the United States, the youngest and \n     fastest growing ethnic community in the Nation, continue the \n     tradition of honoring their children on this day, and wish to \n     share this custom with the rest of the Nation;\n       Whereas 1 in 4 Americans is projected to be of Hispanic \n     descent by the year 2050, and as of 2003, approximately \n     12,300,000 Hispanic children live in the United States;\n       Whereas traditional Hispanic family life centers largely on \n     children;\n       Whereas the primary teachers of family values, morality, \n     and culture are parents and family members, and we rely on \n     children to pass on these family values, morals, and culture \n     to future generations;\n       Whereas more than 500,000 children drop out of school each \n     year, and Hispanic dropout rates are unacceptably high;\n       Whereas the importance of literacy and education are most \n     often communicated to children through family members;\n       Whereas families should be encouraged to engage in family \n     and community activities that include extended and elderly \n     family members and encourage children to explore, develop \n     confidence, and pursue their dreams;\n       Whereas the designation of a day to honor the children of \n     the United States will help affirm for the people of the \n     United States the significance of family, education, and \n     community;\n       Whereas the designation of a day of special recognition for \n     the children of the United States will provide an opportunity \n     for children to reflect on their future, to articulate their \n     dreams and aspirations, and to find comfort and security in \n     the support of their family members and communities;\n       Whereas the National Latino Children's Institute, serving \n     as a voice for children, has worked with cities throughout \n     the country to declare April 30 as ``Dia de los Ninos: \n     Celebrating Young Americans''--a day to bring together \n     Hispanics and other communities nationwide to celebrate and \n     uplift children;

Res. 30\n\n       Whereas the United States is the only major industrialized \n     country that does not have universal access to health \n     insurance among its citizens;\n       Whereas the number of Americans without health insurance \n     has increased steadily over the past decade from 37,000,000 \n     to 45,000,000;\n       Whereas 7 in 10 people without health insurance live in \n     families where at least one person works full-time;\n       Whereas 20 percent of uninsured Americans are children;\n       Whereas members of racial and ethnic minority groups at all \n     income levels are more likely to be uninsured than their \n     White counterparts;\n       Whereas the percentage of private-sector employers offering \n     health benefits to retirees has declined by more than 40 \n     percent since 1997 to just 13 percent in 2002;\n       Whereas in 2003, 1,700,000 veterans and 3,900,000 \n     dependents of veterans did not have access to health \n     insurance or veterans medical care;\n       Whereas uninsured Americans receive less preventive care \n     and are diagnosed at a more advanced stage of disease than \n     Americans with health insurance;\n       Whereas uninsured adults have mortality rates approximately \n     25 percent higher than those of privately insured adults;\n       Whereas the financial consequences of uninsurance can be \n     disastrous for families, as demonstrated by a recent study \n     that found medical problems were a factor in nearly half of \n     all personal bankruptcy filings;\n       Whereas the increase in average health insurance costs \n     since 2000 was five times the increase in average worker \n     wages;\n       Whereas the total cost of job-based health insurance has \n     risen 72 percent in the past 5 years;\n       Whereas employers are struggling to keep up with rising \n     health insurance costs;\n       Whereas a recent study by the Commonwealth Fund concluded \n     that small employers that provide health insurance to their \n     employees pay more but receive less for their money while \n     suffering faster increases in premiums and steeper jumps in \n     deductibles than large firms;\n       Whereas the market for individual insurance policies can be \n     prohibitively expensive and allows for discrimination based \n     on health status;\n       Whereas rising health insurance costs undermine United \n     States competitiveness in the global market;\n       Whereas despite spending the most per capita on health care \n     ($4,887 compared to Germany which is the next highest at \n     $2,808), the United States ranks 12th out of 13 \n     industrialized nations in 16 top health indicators such as \n     infant mortality; and\n       Whereas members of Congress and their families have the \n     opportunity to select among many benefit choices and to \n     purchase high quality, group health insurance coverage at \n     reasonable rates: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That--\n       (1) Congress should enact legislation that will ensure that \n     all Americans have access to affordable, quality health \n     insurance coverage by 2010, regardless of income, age, \n     employment or health status;\n       (2) such legislation should utilize private and public \n     sector solutions;\n       (3) rather than shifting greater costs to consumers, such \n     legislation should constrain underlying health care costs, \n     including by assuring appropriate utilization, and lowering \n     prescription drug costs and administrative expenses; and\n       (4) such legislation should assure high quality health care \n     by promoting the utilization of information technology, \n     reducing medical errors, providing for care coordination, and \n     through other methods designed to improve quality.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/28/senate-section/article/S4597-3", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4597]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 591.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed en bloc to the following resolutions submitted earlier today: \nS. Res. 128, S. Res. 129, S. Res. 130, and S. Res. 131.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senate will proceed to \nthe measures en bloc.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to support an important \nresolution designating the 30th day of April 2005 as ``Dia de los \nNinos: Celebrating Young Americans.''\n  Nations throughout the world, and especially within Latin America, \ncelebrate Dia de los Ninos on the 30th of April, in recognition and \ncelebration of their country's future--their children. Many American \nHispanic families continue the tradition of honoring their children on \nthis day by celebrating Dia de los Ninos in their homes.\n  The designation of a day to honor the children of the Nation will \nhelp affirm for the people of the United States the significance of \nfamily, education, and community. This special recognition of children \nwill provide us with an opportunity to reflect on their future, \narticulate their dreams and aspirations, and find comfort and security \nin the support of their family members and communities. This resolution \ncalls on the American people to join with all children, families, \norganizations, communities, churches, cities, and States across the \nNation to observe the day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n  Joining me as original cosponsors to this resolution are John Cornyn, \nCharles E. Grassley, Kay Bailey Hutchison, Mel Martinez, and Lisa \nMurkowski.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to join us in promptly passing this \nresolution designating April 30, 2005, Dia de los Ninos: Celebrating \nYoung Americans.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I rise, on behalf of myself, Mr. \nIsakson, Mr. Obama, and Mr. Kennedy, to support a bipartisan resolution \ncalling on the American people to observe North American Occupational \nSafety and Health Week, May 1 through May 7, 2005. This week is \ndesigned to increase the awareness and importance of preventing injury \nand illness in the workplace. I introduced a similar resolution in May \n2002, and I am proud to sponsor it again.\n  The focus of this year's North American Occupational Safety and \nHealth Week is on the estimated 5,500 people killed in workplace \naccidents and the millions who suffer on-the-job injuries and illnesses \neach year. The week will focus on preventing such tragedies from \noccurring and draw attention to the positive return on investment for \nbusinesses that invest in occupational safety and health.\n  The Department of Labor recently gave the Monsanto research facility \nin Waterman, IL, its top safety classification: Star Certification in \nthe Voluntary Protection Program. VPP is a program that goes beyond \ncurrent workplace regulations to establish cooperative relationships \nbetween management and workers to implement a comprehensive health and \nsafety system. It requires rigorous review by the Occupational Safety \nand Health Administration and involves companies with injury rates \nwhich average about 53 percent lower than the average for their \nindustry.\n  OSHA also recognized three Illinois beef packing companies for their \nexemplary injury and illness records. Aurora Packing Company, Inc., of \nNorth Aurora, New City Packing Company, Inc., of Aurora, and Prairie \nPackaging Company of Bridgeview were commended by OSHA's VPP. Aurora \nand New City have achieved Star Conditional status for 11 years now, \nand Prairie was recognized this year as a Merit Participant. Fewer than \n1,000 Federal worksites under Federal jurisdiction share this honor and \nI am very proud of their accomplishments. The Labor Department says VPP \nsites are ``models for what employers and employees can accomplish by \nworking cooperatively with one another and with OSHA to achieve a level \nof worker protection that goes beyond compliance with Government \nregulations.'' The VPP program is a win-win situation for everyone \nbecause workers experience fewer illnesses and injuries, and companies \ncan expect lower workers' compensation costs. While there is more work \nto be done to improve the health and safety of America's workers, I \ncongratulate these firms for their achievements.\n  The American Society of Safety Engineers, based in Des Plaines, IL, \nis a major proponent of North American Occupational Health and Safety \nWeek and has sponsored this awareness week for many years. ASSE is the \nworld's oldest and largest professional safety organization. It is a \n90-year-old nonprofit association and has more than 30,000 members. It \nis committed to protecting people, property, and the environment. \nTogether with OSHA, ASSE will be working to educate employees, \nemployers and the public about the positive benefits of occupational \nsafety and health programs; raise the awareness of the role and \ncontribution of safety, health, and environmental professionals; and \nreduce workplace injuries and illness by increasing awareness and \nimplementation of safety and health programs.\n\n[[Page S4603]]\n\n  In addition to ASSE, the Canadian Society of Safety Engineers, the \nAmerican Association of Occupational Health Nurses, the Academy of \nCertified Hazardous Materials Managers, the American Industrial Hygiene \nAssociation and the American National Standards Institute are all \nworking toward the goal of a safer, healthier, working America and \nsupport this resolution.\n  In support of that goal, I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting \nthis bipartisan resolution.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am proud to submit today with my friend \nand colleague Senator Specter a bipartisan resolution to designate May \n15, 2005, as National Peace Officers Memorial Day. Joining us in the \nintroduction of this resolution are Senators Hatch, Biden, Brownback, \nCornyn, DeWine, Durbin, Feingold, Feinstein, Kennedy, Kohl, Kyl, and \nSchumer.\n  This is the ninth year running that I have been involved in the \nintroduction of this resolution to keep alive in the memory of all \nAmericans the sacrifice and commitment of those law enforcement \nofficers who lost their lives serving their communities. For 8 years I \nintroduced this resolution with my old friend and our former colleague \nSenator Campbell, a former deputy sheriff who was a true leader on this \nissue. Now I have teamed with Senator Specter, a former prosecutor who \nhas witnessed first-hand the risks faced by law enforcement officers \nevery day while they serve and protect our communities. His knowledge \nand experience in this area is a true asset to the American people and \nI thank him for his leadership on it.\n  I also want to thank each of our Nation's brave law enforcement \nofficers for their unwavering commitment to the safety and protection \nof their fellow citizens. They are real-life heroes, too many of whom \ntoo often give the ultimate sacrifice, and they remind us of how \nimportant it is to support and respect our state and local police \nofficers.\n  Currently, more than 850,000 men and women who guard our communities \ndo so at great risk. Each year, 1 in 15 officers is assaulted, 1 in 46 \nofficers is injured, and 1 in 5,255 officers is killed in the line of \nduty in the United States every other day. After the hijacked planes \nhit the World Trade Center in New York City on September 11, 2001, 72 \npeace officers died while trying to ensure that their fellow citizens \nin those buildings got to safety. That act of terrorism resulted in the \nhighest number of peace officers ever killed in a single incident in \nthe history of our country.\n  In 2004, 154 law enforcement officers died while serving in the line \nof duty, well below the decade-long average of 169 deaths annually, and \na major drop from 2001 when a total of 237 officers were killed. A \nnumber of factors contributed to this reduction including better \nequipment and the increased use of bullet-resistant vests, improved \ntraining and advanced emergency medical care. And, in total, more than \n17,500 men and women have made the ultimate sacrifice--of that number \n42 are police officers who have already been killed in 2005 while \nserving in the line of duty.\n  In the 108th Congress, we shepherded into law a number of measures to \nissues to make a difference in the lives of all police officers and the \ncommunities they serve. We improved the Justice Department's Public \nSafety Officers Benefits Program by making law the Hometown Heroes \nSurvivors Benefits Act, P.L. No. 108-182, which allows survivors of \npublic safety officers who suffer fatal heart attacks or strokes while \nparticipating in non-routine stressful or strenuous physical activities \nto qualify for Federal survivor benefits.\n  Also becoming law was the Campbell-Leahy Bulletproof Vest Partnership \nGrant Act, P.L. No. 108-372, which extends through fiscal year 2007 the \nauthorization of appropriations for the Bulletproof Vest Partnership \nGrant Program that helps State, tribal and local jurisdictions purchase \narmor vests for use by law enforcement officers. I hope that with the \nhelp of this program we can make sure that every police officer who \nneeds a bulletproof vest gets one.\n  Last year, the Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act, which Senator \nCampbell and I championed in the Senate, was signed into law, P.L. No: \n108-277. This measure established national measures of uniformity and \nconsistency to permit trained and certified on-duty, off-duty or \nretired law enforcement officers to carry concealed firearms in most \nsituations so that they may respond immediately to crimes across State \nand other jurisdictional lines, as well as to protect themselves and \ntheir families from vindictive criminals.\n  National Peace Officers Memorial Day will provide the people of the \nUnited States with the opportunity to honor the extraordinary service \nand sacrifice given year after year by our police forces. More than \n25,000 peace officers are expected to gather in Washington to join with \nthe families of their fallen comrades. I hope my colleagues will join \nus in supporting passage of this important bipartisan resolution.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the preambles \nbe agreed to, the resolutions be agreed to, and the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolutions were agreed to.\n  The preambles were agreed to.\n  The resolutions, with their preambles, read as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 128\n\n       Whereas many nations throughout the world, and especially \n     within the Western hemisphere, celebrate ``Dia de los \n     Ninos'', or ``Day of the Children'' on the 30th of April, in \n     recognition and celebration of their country's future--their \n     children;\n       Whereas children represent the hopes and dreams of the \n     people of the United States;\n       Whereas children are the center of American families;\n       Whereas children should be nurtured and invested in to \n     preserve and enhance economic prosperity, democracy, and the \n     American spirit;\n       Whereas Hispanics in the United States, the youngest and \n     fastest growing ethnic community in the Nation, continue the \n     tradition of honoring their children on this day, and wish to \n     share this custom with the rest of the Nation;\n       Whereas 1 in 4 Americans is projected to be of Hispanic \n     descent by the year 2050, and as of 2003, approximately \n     12,300,000 Hispanic children live in the United States;\n       Whereas traditional Hispanic family life centers largely on \n     children;\n       Whereas the primary teachers of family values, morality, \n     and culture are parents and family members, and we rely on \n     children to pass on these family values, morals, and culture \n     to future generations;\n       Whereas more than 500,000 children drop out of school each \n     year, and Hispanic dropout rates are unacceptably high;\n       Whereas the importance of literacy and education are most \n     often communicated to children through family members;\n       Whereas families should be encouraged to engage in family \n     and community activities that include extended and elderly \n     family members and encourage children to explore, develop \n     confidence, and pursue their dreams;\n       Whereas the designation of a day to honor the children of \n     the United States will help affirm for the people of the \n     United States the significance of family, education, and \n     community;\n       Whereas the designation of a day of special recognition for \n     the children of the United States will provide an opportunity \n     for children to reflect on their future, to articulate their \n     dreams and aspirations, and to find comfort and security in \n     the support of their family members and communities;\n       Whereas the National Latino Children's Institute, serving \n     as a voice for children, has worked with cities throughout \n     the country to declare April 30 as ``Dia de los Ninos: \n     Celebrating Young Americans''--a day to bring together \n     Hispanics and other communities nationwide to celebrate and \n     uplift children; and\n       Whereas the children of a nation are the responsibility of \n     all its people, and people should be encouraged to celebrate \n     the gifts of children to society--their curiosity, laughter, \n     faith, energy, spirit, hopes, and dreams: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates April 30, 2005, as ``Dia de los Ninos: \n     Celebrating Young Americans''; and\n       (2) calls on the people of the United States to join with \n     all children, families, organizations, communities, churches, \n     cities, and States across the United States to observe the \n     day with appropriate ceremonies, including activities that--\n       (A) center around children, and are free or minimal in cost \n     so as to encourage and facilitate the participation of all \n     our people;\n       (B) are positive and uplifting and that help children \n     express their hopes and dreams;\n       (C) provide opportunities for children of all backgrounds \n     to learn about one another's cultures and to share ideas;\n       (D) include all members of the family, and especially \n     extended and elderly family members, so as to promote greater \n     communication among the generations within a family, enabling \n     children to appreciate and benefit from the experiences and \n     wisdom of their elderly family members;\n\n[[Page S4604]]\n\n       (E) provide opportunities for families within a community \n     to get acquainted; and\n       (F) provide children with the support they need to develop \n     skills and confidence, and to find the inner strength--the \n     will and fire of the human spirit--to make their dreams come \n     true.\n\n                              S. Res. 129\n\n       Whereas 2005 will mark the 100th anniversary of the \n     Virginia Retail Merchants Association (referred to in this \n     resolution as the ``Association'');\n       Whereas on May 12 1905, the Association was formed to \n     encourage, stimulate, extend, and promote the business of \n     retail merchants in the Commonwealth of Virginia, and to \n     promote the social, moral, and financial welfare of those \n     engaged in the business of retail merchandising;\n       Whereas the Association has endeavored to curtail trade \n     abuses in the retail industry and other injurious practices \n     and to secure the cooperation of consumers, retail merchants, \n     and retail suppliers in producing healthy retail trade;\n       Whereas the Association has worked to secure the enactment \n     of reasonable and proper laws to protect consumers and the \n     retail and services trade;\n       Whereas it is the goal of the Association to encourage \n     proper and business-like methods in the conduct of business \n     affairs and to advance, by legitimate and fair means, the \n     interests of retail merchants and the free enterprise system;\n       Whereas, in 1905, the Association chartered the Lynchburg \n     Retail Merchants Association;\n       Whereas, in 1906, the Association chartered the Retail \n     Merchants Association of Greater Richmond;\n       Whereas, in 1907, the Association chartered the Petersburg \n     Retail Merchants Association;\n       Whereas, in 1913, the Association chartered the Hampton \n     Retail Merchants Association;\n       Whereas, in 1919, the Association chartered the Danville \n     Retail Merchants Association;\n       Whereas, in the 1950s, the Association chartered the \n     Franklin County Retail Merchants Association and the \n     Williamsburg Retail Merchants Association;\n       Whereas, in subsequent years, the Association chartered the \n     South Boston Retail Merchants Association and Charlottesville \n     Retail Merchants Association;\n       Whereas, in 1978, the Association formed the Virginia \n     Retail Political Action Committee or VARPAC;\n       Whereas the Association and its retail member associations \n     represent more than 5,400 retailers and other associated \n     businesses throughout the Commonwealth of Virginia; and\n       Whereas the Association has been an active proponent of the \n     free enterprise system for 100 years: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) congratulates the Virginia Retail Merchants Association \n     on its 100th anniversary; and\n       (2) recognizes its years of service to the retail \n     community.\n\n                              S. Res. 130\n\n       Whereas every year more than 5,500 people die from job-\n     related injuries and millions more suffer occupational \n     injuries and illnesses;\n       Whereas every day millions of people go to and return home \n     from work safely due, in part, to the efforts of many unsung \n     heroes, such as occupational safety, health, and \n     environmental practitioners, who work day in and day out \n     identifying hazards and implementing safety and health \n     advances, in all industries and at all workplaces, aimed at \n     eliminating workplace fatalities, injuries, and illnesses;\n       Whereas these occupational safety, health, and \n     environmental professionals work to prevent accidents, \n     injuries, and occupational diseases, create safer work and \n     leisure environments, develop safer products, and are \n     committed to protecting people, property, and the \n     environment;\n       Whereas the work of these professionals in the areas of \n     health promotion, disease prevention, and wellness programs \n     contributes greatly to the improvement of overall employee \n     health, increased productivity, and reduction in health care \n     costs, and yields significant returns on investments in \n     occupational safety and health for the employer;\n       Whereas our society has long recognized that a safe and \n     healthy workplace positively impacts employee morale, health, \n     and productivity;\n       Whereas the more than 150,000 combined members of the \n     American Society of Safety Engineers (ASSE), the Academy of \n     Certified Hazardous Materials Managers (ACHMM), the American \n     Association of Occupational Health Nurses, Inc. (AAOHN), the \n     American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA), and the \n     American National Standards Institute (ANSI) are occupational \n     safety, health, and environmental practitioners committed to \n     protecting people, property, and the environment;\n       Whereas the purpose of ``North American Occupational Safety \n     and Health Week (NAOSH)'' is to increase the understanding of \n     the benefits of investing in occupational safety and health, \n     to demonstrate the positive impact that integrating effective \n     safety and health programs in the workplace and the community \n     has on the economy and business, to raise awareness of the \n     role and contribution of safety, health, and environmental \n     professionals in all areas, and to reduce workplace injuries \n     and illnesses by increasing awareness and implementation of \n     safety and health programs; and\n       Whereas during the week of May 1 through May 7, 2005, and \n     throughout the year, the ASSE, ACHMM, AAOHN, AIHA, and ANSI, \n     and their respective memberships, will work to raise \n     employers', employees', and the public's understanding of the \n     importance of occupational safety, health, and the \n     environment in everyone's lives, and to provide valuable \n     information and resources aimed at decreasing further \n     workplace fatalities, injuries, and illnesses: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week of May 1 through May 7, 2005, as \n     ``North American Occupational Safety and Health Week \n     (NAOSH)'';\n       (2) commends occupational safety, health, and environmental \n     professionals for their ongoing commitment to protecting \n     people, property, and the environment;\n       (3) encourages all industries, organizations, community \n     leaders, employers, and employees to support educational \n     activities aimed at increasing awareness of the importance of \n     preventing illness, injury, and death in the workplace during \n     the week of May 1 through May 7, 2005, and throughout the \n     year; and\n       (4) encourages the people of the United States to observe \n     ``North American Occupational Safety and Health Week \n     (NAOSH)'' with appropriate programs and activities.\n\n                              S.

Res. 117) designating the week of May 9, \n     2005, as National Hepatitis B Awareness Week.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I express my support today for an \nimportant resolution, S. Res. 117, submitted by Senators Feinstein and \nSantorum along with Senator Santorum to designate the week of May 9th \nas National Hepatitis B Awareness Week.\n  Hepatitis B is an extremely infectious virus that affects more than \n12 million Americans, with 100,000 new cases expected this year. \nUnfortunately, many people don't even know they have this disease. And \nby the time they do learn about the disease it with Hepatitis B will \ndevelop cirrhosis of the liver or liver cancer.\n  The good news is that we can beat this disease. Scientists have been \nworking for years and have made great strides in the study and \ntreatment of Hepatitis B. As kindergarteners through college students \nknow, there are very effective vaccines available to slow the \ngenerational relay of the virus. And just last month the FDA approved a \nnew treatment drug called Baraclude that seeks to alleviate symptoms \nfor those already chronically infected with the virus.\n  What I surprisingly discovered is that less than 10 percent of people \nsuffering from chronic Hepatitis B infection are receiving treatment. \nDuring this week, I strongly urge people to talk to their doctors about \nHepatitis B vaccination, testing, and treatment; to become educated \nabout Hepatitis B, the symptoms, treatments and testing available; and \nto take steps to educate those around about Hepatitis B. I urge people \nto take part in the discussions about Hepatitis B during this week. I \nalso wish to applaud those working to make sure that communities and \nfamilies and individuals are aware of this disease, testing and \ntreatments available. Thank you for all of your dedication and caring.\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution and preamble \nbe agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table and any \nstatements relating thereto be printed in the Record, with no \nintervening action.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S.

Res. 117\n\n       Whereas hepatitis B is the most common serious liver \n     infection in the world;\n       Whereas chronic hepatitis B infections cause 80 percent of \n     all primary liver cancer cases worldwide;\n       Whereas 10,000,000 to 30,000,000 people will be infected \n     with the hepatitis B virus worldwide in 2005;\n       Whereas approximately 100,000 people in the United States \n     will become infected with hepatitis B virus this year alone;\n       Whereas fewer than 10 percent of diagnosed chronic \n     hepatitis B patients in the United States are currently \n     receiving treatment for their disease;\n       Whereas healthcare and work loss costs from liver disease \n     and liver cancer-caused hepatitis B infections total more \n     than $700,000,000 annually;\n       Whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n     (CDC) estimates that 1,250,000 Americans are already infected \n     with hepatitis B and nearly 6,000 will die of liver \n     complications each year;\n       Whereas a person who has become infected with hepatitis B \n     may not have symptoms for up to 40 years after the initial \n     infection has occurred, and there is currently no routine \n     screening in place for early detection;\n       Whereas the CDC has identified African-Americans, Asian-\n     Americans, and Pacific Islanders, as well as Native Americans \n     and Alaskan Natives, as having higher rates of hepatitis B \n     infection in the United States;\n       Whereas Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders account for \n     more than half of the chronic hepatitis B cases and half of \n     the deaths resulting from chronic hepatitis B infection in \n     the United States; and\n       Whereas there is a need for a comprehensive public \n     education and awareness campaign designed to help infected \n     patients and their physicians identify and manage the \n     secondary prevention of the disease and to help increase the \n     length and quality of life for those diagnosed with chronic \n     hepatitis B: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week of May 9, 2005, as ``National \n     Hepatitis B Awareness Week'';\n       (2) calls upon the people of the United States to observe \n     the week with appropriate programs and activities; and\n       (3) supports raising awareness of the consequences of \n     untreated chronic hepatitis B and the urgency to seek \n     appropriate care as a serious public health issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/28/senate-section/article/S4605-2", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4605-S4606]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          ANIMAL FIGHTING PROHIBITION ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
