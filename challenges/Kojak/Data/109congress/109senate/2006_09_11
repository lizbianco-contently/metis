Five years and a day ago, we rarely saw flags flying at \nevery door. Five years and a day ago, men in suits rarely wore flag \npins. Today, 5 years after September 11, from sea to sea, flags fly \nproudly in our front yards, on our suit lapels, and in our hearts.\n  The acts of terrorism that September morn lit for all Americans a \nlamp blazing through the smoke and pain and tears and flames. Even as \nour hearts ached, our hopes soared, inspired by the selfless courage \nand devotion of ordinary people performing extraordinary feats of \ncourage and devotion.\n  Men and women--good, kind, loving moms and dads, sons and daughters, \nbrothers and sisters--died that day. For that, we can never cease to \ngrieve. But the light that shone on September 11 cannot die. It cannot \nbe dimmed. It cannot fail. It cannot fail because it is the light of \ntheir spirit and of ours. It is the light of a great republic, of a \nfree and democratic people.\n  September 11 will always be our burden. Our minds, our souls, our \nhearts cannot forget. We must not forget. But we must also always \nremember that our fallen children in those fallen towers relit a lamp \nthat outshines the evil done to us. In their loss, and in ours, they \nremind us, as could nothing else, of that for which we stand--that \nliberty is our central value, that freedom is our cardinal virtue, that \nwe love our country and our flag and our people for the light we shine, \non ourselves, to the world, and for the future of humanity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/11/senate-section/article/S9283-7", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9283]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNITION OF THE ACTING MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, 5 years ago today, al-Qaida terrorists \nlaunched a brutal sneak attack on American soil. It was their deadliest \nattack ever and a day America will never forget.\n  Today, we remember and honor the innocent victims of that attack and \nstand in support of their families and communities.\n  We honor the heroic police officers, firefighters, and emergency \nmedical personnel who rushed into burning buildings when everyone else \nwas rushing out.\n  We honor the valiant passengers of United Airlines Flight 93, who \ngave their lives to save thousands of others--including, quite \npossibly, many in the building in which we stand.\n  We honor millions of good-hearted volunteers who lined up to help \ntheir fellow Americans and donated time, money, blood, and literally \neverything they could.\n  We honor the families who opened their homes, the houses of worship \nthat opened their doors, and the schoolchildren who saw evil for the \nfirst time but were not afraid to open their hearts.\n  We honor the military and law enforcement personnel whose vigilance \nhas kept us from attack since that day. It is because of their service \nwe have not been attacked at home in the 5 years since.\n  Some have made the ultimate sacrifice, and we honor their families, \nwhile realizing the debt can never be repaid.\n  As the country reflects on what happened that tragic day, we must \nremember this: Two skyscrapers may be gone, but 5 years after 9/11, \nAmerica stands taller than ever.\n  America is on the offense against terrorists, and America is winning \nthe war on terror. And thanks to hard and dangerous work over the last \n5 years, today, America is safer. To make us safer still, we continue \nto wage war against terrorists who would harm America here and around \nthe world. Of the senior terrorist leaders whom our Government has been \ntracking, many have been apprehended or killed, and we are disrupting \nthe flow of money, supplies, people, and information to the terrorists.\n  But we must stay on the offensive. This Congress must ensure that the \nbrave men and women fighting under our flag have everything they need \nto complete their mission. War is horror, and none of us want these \nheroes torn away from their homes and families. But we must confront \nthe fundamental reality of 9/11. The enemy was at war with us for years \nprior to that attack. It was only on that day that we began to fight \nback with the effort necessary to beat this warped and virulent strain \nof radical Islam. And we will prevail over the toxic death wish that \npreaches indiscriminate killing of men, women, and children in the Name \nof the Almighty.\n  Most importantly, all of us must do what we can to sustain the faith \nof our fellow citizens through this long and difficult war. When we \nbegan the fight after 9/11, we knew it would not be short, and we knew \nit would not be easy. In fact, this struggle will last years, perhaps \ndecades. We cannot be sure when we will win, but we can be sure that we \nwill win. We must sustain our faith because as long as we maintain our \nwill to win, we will prevail.\n  Once before, America was the target of a surprise deadly attack. Two \ndays after that attack, on December 9, 1941, President Franklin \nRoosevelt addressed the Nation. Here is what he had to say:\n\n       When we resort to force, as now we must, we are determined \n     that this force shall be directed toward ultimate good as \n     well as against immediate evil. We Americans are not \n     destroyers, we are builders. . . . We are going to win the \n     war and we are going to win the peace that follows.\n\n  What was true then is truer today. We do not fight for death and \ndestruction, as the terrorists do. We fight for liberty. That is \nAmerica's greatest strength. And no terrorist attack will ever diminish \nit.\n  Five years ago today, Members of Congress from both parties and both \nChambers stood united on the Capitol steps and sang ``God Bless \nAmerica.'' In the days that followed, our Nation witnessed a resurgence \nin unity and in purpose.\n  Voluntarism soared. American flags sold out of stores overnight. Just \nas we stood united here, the country stood united against a growing \nthreat.\n  This evening, Members of Congress will return to the steps and join \ntogether to remember that day of resolve. And as we once again ``swear \nallegiances to a land that's free,'' it is my sincere hope that we will \nreignite our united purpose.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/11/senate-section/article/S9284-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9284]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise to take a moment to recognize that \ntoday is the fifth anniversary of the September 11 attacks. That day 5 \nyears ago changed the way we all think about the world. The \nconsequences were profound. We learned that we must be prepared for \nthreats we cannot even imagine.\n  That is why our work here today on the Port Security Improvement Act \nis so important. I was pleased to help write the Port Security \nImprovement Act of 2006, the amendment before the Senate today. I am \nproud of our work. Working together, we have crafted legislation to \nhelp keep our ports safe and our economy strong. The legislation \nstrikes a balance. It protects Americans, and it preserves the free \nflow of commerce upon which our prosperity depends.\n  Last year, nearly 11 million containers came into our country. That \nis more than 30,000 containers every day. They arrive at more than 300 \nports all across our borders. That number of containers is expected to \ndouble over the next 3 years. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection \nAgency is responsible for ensuring that not one of those millions of \ncontainers--not one--carries with it anything that could harm us. It is \na daunting task. It would be tempting to say we should slow this \ntorrent of containers to a trickle. It would be tempting to say we \nshould allow Customs and Border Protection unlimited time to do its job \nto protect us from harm, but slowing trade to a trickle would also \ncause America great harm. It would cripple our economy.\n  Ensuring security is only half of the work of Customs and Border \nProtection. The agency is also charged with carrying on the centuries-\nold responsibility of its predecessor, the U.S. Customs Service, to \nfacilitate the commerce so critical to keeping our economy strong.\n  Cross-border trade accounts for fully a quarter of the American \neconomy--one-quarter. How, then, do we keep this flow of trade both \nsafe and smooth? I believe this legislation tries to do just that. We \nhave given Customs and Border Protection more tools and resources to \naccomplish both of its missions.\n  We authorize $1.2 billion in port security grant assistance, and we \nauthorize another $750 million for key programs such as the Container \nSecurity Initiative and the automated targeting system.\n  We also authorize funds to fulfill the promise of the Customs Trade \nPartnership Against Terrorism. We provide the personnel to validate \nsupply chain security for the thousands of American importers eager to \nparticipate in the program and keep their cargo moving.\n  I also strongly support testing and deployment of fully integrated \ncontainer scanning systems capable of increasing the security of \ncontainers in foreign ports while maintaining or improving the \nprocessing time of just-in-time cargoes. The more we can know about a \ncontainer before it gets to America, the safer we all will be.\n  But technology is not a panacea. We need people at our land and \nseaports to detect and deter contraband or unlawful persons from \nentering our country. My State of Montana is a border State. In \nMontana, we have new cargo examination equipment, but we don't have new \npersonnel to run it.\n  We need people to ensure the robust enforcement of our trade laws and \ntrade agreements upon which American companies and workers rely. That\n\n[[Page S9285]]\n\nis why, in the 2002 Homeland Security Act, Congress prohibited any \ndiminution in Customs trade facilitation and enforcement functions. And \nwe prohibited any reduction or consolidation of the personnel \nperforming those functions.\n  In violation of that act, personnel dedicated to revenue collection \nand trade enforcement are increasingly being asked to assist with port \nsecurity-related functions for which they are neither trained nor \nequipped. Since 2003, trade personnel numbers decreased by as much as \n15 percent.\n  This legislation reverses this damaging trend by requiring Customs \nand Border Protection to restore personnel vital to its commercial \nmission. At the same time, we ensure sufficient numbers of security-\nfocused personnel by adding uniformed officers at every one of our \nNation's ports. We can do both, and we need to do both.\n  The legislation also creates an Office of International Trade within \nCustoms and Border Protection. The new office would be headed by an \nAssistant Commissioner for International Trade, reporting directly to \nthe Commissioner.\n  This office is responsible for supervising and giving policy \ndirection to employees before the agency's commercial and revenue \nfunctions. This structural change is designed to give voice to the \nconcerns of commerce. It will guarantee that the concerns of commerce \nreceive due consideration.\n  And an International Trade Policy Committee within Customs and Border \nProtection will assist the Commissioner in coordinating with the \nAssistant Secretary for Policy. The committee will help them implement \npolicies related to the commercial customs and trade facilitation \nfunctions within the Agency.\n  Mr. President, if security at our ports is compromised, then the \ninternational trade that drives our Nation's economy could grind to a \nhalt. But if security at our ports does not protect the overall health \nof the international commerce system, then that would not provide \nAmericans real security. We need to do both.\n  I am very pleased with the legislation before us. We still need to \naddress other critical transportation security issues, such as rail and \ntransit security, which this legislation doesn't do. But the pending \namendment is a critical component of a national strategy on homeland \nand economic security.\n  This legislation would not have been completed without the tireless \nefforts of my colleagues. I thank and commend Senator Inouye, Senator \nStevens especially for his very helpful work, Murray, Collins, \nLieberman, Coleman, and my dear friend, the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, Senator Grassley.\n  Too many staff to name have worked countless hours to get this \nlegislation ready, and I thank them.\n  Working together, I believe we have created something that both \nsafeguards our Nation's ports and protects American prosperity. America \nneeds us to do both. That is why America needs us to pass this \nimportant legislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, 5 years ago, our Nation experienced one \nof its darkest days and finest hours. With shocking suddenness, an act \nof unparalleled cruelty transformed the late-summer morning of uncommon \nbrilliance into one of unfathomable horror. On that awful morning, \nSeptember 11 was transformed from a mere point on the calendar into an \neternal monument to the deepest human emotions of loss, of sacrifice, \nand of resolve.\n  We pause today to remember those whose lives were taken that terrible \nmorning--2,996 innocent men, women, and children, workers doing their \njobs, travelers embarking on trips. Men and women like Robert and \nJacqueline Norton of Lubec, ME boarded Flight 11 to celebrate a son's \nwedding in California. In the days just before the trip, the Nortons \nplanted new raspberry bushes in their garden and Robert, at age 85, \nhelped repair the concrete steps at their church.\n  At age 85, Robert Norton was the oldest to perish that day. At age 2, \nChristine Hanson of Groton, MA, was the youngest. She was traveling \nwith her parents to that place of childhood dreams, Disneyland. The \naircraft that was to take the Hanson family on their dream vacation \ninstead was driven into the North Tower. There, on the 92nd floor, were \nJohn and Sylvia Resta of Queens, NY. They worked together and on \nSeptember 11th they died together. Resta was seven months pregnant.\n  The Pentagon that morning was filled with men and women who had \ndedicated their lives to serving their country. Among them was \nCommander Robert Schlegel. After his 1981 graduation from Gray-New \nGloucester High School in Maine, he went to college, married his high-\nschool sweetheart, Dawn, and followed a tradition set by his father and \ntwo brothers by joining the United States Navy. His 15-year Naval \ncareer was one of achievement and courage. Among his many commendations \nwere the Meritorious Service Medal, four Navy and Marine Corps \nCommendation Medals, and the Purple Heart. Shortly before September 11, \nhe had been promoted to the rank of Commander. His new office, on the \nsecond floor of the Pentagon, believed to be the point of impact of \nFlight 77.\n  Each of these names, and the names of so many more, represent lives \nof accomplishment, contribution, and promise. Each loss leaves a wound \nin the hearts of families and friends that can never be fully healed.\n  But September 11 was not just a day of personal tragedy. It was an \nattack on the United States, an attack on freedom, an attack on \ncivilization. We must never forget what was lost, and what remains at \nstake.\n\n  We also pause today to remember the heroes whose courage saved \ncountless lives then, and who continue to inspire us. Yamel Merino, of \nYonkers, NY, was described by colleagues as the perfect EMT. She gave \nher life while helping the injured near the World Trade Center when the \nfirst tower collapsed.\n  After an outstanding career with the FBI, John O'Neill became head of \nsecurity for the World Trade Center. He exited the building safely \nafter the first of the two hijacked planes hit, but re-entered when he \nsaw the extent of the damage and the danger to others. He saved lives, \nbut could not save himself.\n  After his safe exit from the Pentagon, Staff Sergeant Christopher \nBraman rushed back into the burning building, returning again and again \nto find survivors and to carry them to safety. He stayed on the scene \nfor the next 3 days, working past exhaustion, saving lives with the \nsearch and rescue skills the U.S. Army had taught him.\n  In the days and weeks immediately following the attacks, we were \nmoved by the selfless courage of the men and women--passengers and \ncrew--aboard Flight 93. By wresting control of that aircraft from the \nterrorists, they knowingly gave their lives so that others might live. \nTodd Beamer's Let's Roll! became our Nation's rallying cry.\n  Last month, additional recordings of emergency calls made that \nterrible morning were released. One contains a statement that describes \nwith eloquent simplicity the spirit of September 11. Amid the \nsuffocating smoke, searing flames, and falling debris of the South \nTower, the last words Fire Captain Patrick Brown spoke from the 35th \nfloor to the outside world were these: ``We're still heading up.''\n  We may never know where the courage to keep heading up into such \ndanger comes from. We must always honor it. We must never forget.\n  As we pledge to never forget what was lost and what was given on \nSeptember 11, we must in the same breath pledge to do all that we can \nto prevent future attacks. We can offer no guarantee, but that must be \nour goal.\n  The fundamental obligation of Government is to protect its people. \nSince September 11, we have done much to meet that obligation. \nImmediately after the attacks, we passed legislation to close the gap \nbetween law enforcement and intelligence that the terrorists exploited. \nThe reauthorization signed into law earlier this year makes permanent \nmany provisions from the original law that are important to protect \nAmericans from terrorists. Equally important, it contains significant \nnew safeguards that protect the civil liberties we cherish but that the \nterrorists despise.\n\n  We created the Department of Homeland Security to provide a unifying\n\n[[Page S9286]]\n\ncore to the vast effort of detecting and preventing terrorist attacks, \nassessing and protecting our vulnerabilities, and improving our \nresponse to disasters of all types. We have made great investments in \ntraining and equipping first responders throughout the nation. We have \nstrengthened our borders with additional personnel, better coordination \nwith State and local authorities, and cutting-edge technology so that \nthey remain open to our friends but increasingly closed to our enemies.\n  We passed the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of \n2004, which Senator Lieberman and I authored. This legislation, based \non the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission, brought about the most \ncomprehensive reforms of our intelligence community in more than a half \ncentury so that the trail of dots terrorists leave behind as they plan, \ntrain, and organize will never again be left unconnected. This newly \nrestructured intelligence community has uncovered terrorist plots, \ncells, and financing operations, and it played an important role in \nthwarting the scheme to blow up transatlantic airliners that was \nexposed in Britain last month.\n  Today we are on the brink of passing the GreenLane Maritime Security \nAct. America's seaports are vital to our economy, but at the same time \nthey offer a port of entry for those who would do us harm, or for \ndevastating weapons. This bipartisan legislation will help build a \ncoordinated approach to maritime and port security across all levels of \ngovernment with our overseas trading partners. I urge my colleagues to \ntake this major step toward protecting these valuable and vulnerable \nfacilities.\n  We have taken many such steps. None was easily taken. All were \naccompanied by controversy, conflict, and reasonable differences of \nopinion. Yet, working together, we found a way.\n  Each, however, remains a work in progress. DHS has yet to develop the \ncohesion, the common culture, that is needed for its complex \nmission. First responder grants to the States still lack the \naccountability and effective measures of progress needed to prevent the \nwaste of taxpayer dollars. Ongoing shortages of detention space and \npersonnel still leave our borders at risk, despite the many \nimprovements that have been made.\n\n  Other gaps remain. Ten million Americans live and work in proximity \nto plants that produce, use, or store large quantities of hazardous \nchemicals and, indeed, if one talks to the experts, over and over again \nyou will hear them identify the security of our ports and our chemical \nfacilities as major vulnerabilities. We are about to complete action \nthis week on port security legislation. I hope we will turn to chemical \nsecurity legislation as well. There is no question that attacking these \nfacilities fits squarely within the terrorist strategy of causing \nmaximum harm to our people and to our prosperity.\n  Yet 5 years after 9/11, America is left vulnerable by an incomplete \nand inadequate patchwork of laws and voluntary industry standards that \ntoo many facilities fail to observe. The Homeland Security Committee \napproved our bipartisan Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Act more than \n3 months ago by a unanimous vote. For the first time, our legislation \nwould ensure that high-risk chemical facilities are covered by Federal \nstandards that would not only help to deter terrorist attacks but also \nto mitigate the consequences of an attack.\n  Our legislation would give the Department of Homeland Security the \nstrongest possible remedy to ensure compliance: the authority to shut \ndown any chemical facility that does not adequately address the risks \nof a terrorist attack. Unless this legislation moves forward, these \nhighly attractive terrorist communities, large and small, will remain \nwithout the protection they require.\n  The heroes of 9/11 faced grave danger and made great sacrifices in \norder to save others. They performed magnificently despite being \nhampered by obsolete and incompatible communications equipment that \nplaced them in needless peril and resulted in needless loss of life. \nThat should be a major national priority for our country to solve once \nand for all the issue of first responders being able to communicate \nwith one another in the midst of a disaster, whether it is a terrorist \nattack or another hurricane, such as Hurricane Katrina.\n  The Post-Katrina Emergency Reform Act, which Senator Lieberman and I \nintroduced, contains strong provisions to establish a comprehensive \nnational emergency communications strategy and provide State grants for \ninteroperable communications. It is time to act on this legislation--we \nmust never again send our first responders into harm's way with a \ndeficiency that has been so thoroughly revealed.\n  Perhaps our greatest challenge, however, is to recognize that \nterrorism continually evolves. As the devastating attacks in Madrid, \nBali, Istanbul, Beslan, London, and Israel prove, terrorists will \nstrike wherever opportunity allows and wherever innocent people are the \nmost vulnerable. The terrorists' resourcefulness, cunning, and patience \nare exceeded only by their cruelty.\n  Indeed, one of the most striking findings of the 9/11 Commission was \nthat the September 11 attacks were made possible by a failure of \nimagination. Commercial airliners had long been a target of terrorists. \nThe conventional wisdom was that they would be targeted in two ways: to \nhijack for the purpose of taking hostages or to blow up in midair. To \nenvision airliners being hijacked to use as missiles would have taken \nsome imagination, but it was not unimaginable.\n  We all remember one of the striking findings of the 9/11 Commission \nthat the September 11 attacks represented a failure of imagination. How \ndifferent things might be today if 5 years prior to September 11, 2001, \nour imagination had been fully engaged.\n  Mr. President, 1996 was the year that Ramzi Yousef, while awaiting \ntrial for the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, was convicted of a \nconspiracy to plant bombs on a number of U.S. airliners operating in \nEast Asia, and of placing the bomb that exploded on a Philippine \nairliner the previous year.\n  Mr. President, 1996 was the year of the truck bomb attack on Khobar \nTowers that specifically targeted U.S. military personnel.\n  And 1996 was the year that Osama bin Laden relocated from the Sudan \nto Afghanistan, established a new base of operations under the \nprotection of the Taliban, and declared war on the United States.\n  The terrorist strategy was evolving 5 years prior to 2001 to direct \nmassive attacks on high-profile American targets, but we failed to see \nthat these seemingly isolated events were, in fact, tied together.\n  In the aftermath of 9/11, we learned that although the terrorists \ntargeted high-profile targets in major cities, they did much of their \nplanning, training, and transiting in smaller communities--communities \nsuch as Stone Mountain, GA, Norman, OK, and Portland, ME. It may be \nthat they believed these locations shielded their activities from the \nscrutiny they would have been subjected to in their larger, more \nterrorism-savvy target locations.\n\n  Today there is no question that the tactics of terrorists have \nevolved. As the recent arrests in Canada and Miami, the attacks on the \nLondon subway of a year ago, and the thwarted airliner plot in Britain \nhave made clear, terrorist masterminds no longer have to rely on \noperatives imported from abroad to infiltrate target nations and carry \nout attacks. The emerging threat is from home-grown terrorists. They \nare far harder to detect, and increased border security will not \nprotect us from them.\n  Whether the target we seek to protect is a cargo port, a chemical \nplant, a public water supply, the electric grid, or the information \ntechnology networks critical to our economy, it does not take a stretch \nof imagination to see that an attack can come from within just as \neasily, perhaps more easily, than from overseas.\n  From John Walker Lindh, we already know the most extreme ideology can \ntake root even among those who enjoy the most privileged circumstances \nour society can offer. As the details of the British airliner plot \nemerge, it becomes evident that home-grown terrorists, working in \nconjunction with masterminds overseas, can be every bit as \nsophisticated as the imported terrorists who attacked us on 9/11.\n  What is particularly alarming is the evidence that this infection is \nbeing spread within our State and Federal\n\n[[Page S9287]]\n\nprisons, and this is an area that the Homeland Security Committee will \nhold a hearing on next week.\n  Richard Reid--the infamous shoe-bomber--and Jose Padilla both were \nindoctrinated into Islamic extremism while in prison. Less well known, \nbut equally lethal, is Kevin James, a self-styled Imam who, while a \nCalifornia State prison inmate, founded an organization based upon his \nradical interpretation of Islam. James recruited among his fellow \ninmates, allegedly instructing them that it was their duty to kill his \nperceived enemies of Islam--in particular U.S. military personnel and \nsupporters of Israel. Upon their release, his followers reportedly \nconducted surveillance on military installations, the Israeli \nConsulate, and synagogues. It is alleged that they sought firearms with \nsilencers and also explosives and that they financed their operations \nthrough a string of armed robberies in the Los Angeles area. These \noperatives have been arrested and they face trial next month.\n  The new face of terrorism--born and raised in America, in Great \nBritain--has been exposed. This new face of terrorism will challenge \nus, perhaps as much or even more as Osama bin Laden has challenged us. \nBut this is the reality that we must confront. We must not allow our \nimagination to fail us again.\n  Five years ago, in what seemed like a moment, September 11 was \ntransformed from a day like any other day into one that for as long as \nour Nation stands will stand alone. The loss that we relive this day \nreminds us of the value of all that we must protect. The heroism \nreminds us of the unconquerable spirit of the American people. Our \naccomplishments remind us that we can meet any challenge with decisive \naction and a sense of unity. As long as we keep the meaning of this day \nof remembrance in our hearts, I am confident that we can meet any \nchallenge that lies ahead.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander).

I ask unanimous consent this be considered a complete \nsubstitute for the DeMint amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am pleased to offer this amendment on behalf of \nSenator DeMint. The second-degree amendment clarifies some issues in \nthe legislation\n\n[[Page S9288]]\n\nand improves this important legislation. It has been agreed to now by \nSenator Inouye and myself and by Senator DeMint. I think we are closer \nto passing the WARN Act. We have been working for 3 years through the \nHomeland Security and appropriations bill to move DHS to improve the \nnational alerting system. This amendment is a large step forward.\n  If the worst happens and there is a successful attack on one of our \nports, we need a tool to effectively alert communities surrounding the \nport. The purpose of this amendment is to do just that: to move the \nemergency alert system out of the area of broadcast radio and \ntelevision into the wireless era. We need to give the Nation an \nalerting system that harnesses all the capabilities of the digital age.\n  When disaster strikes, we know not everyone will be listening to the \nradio or television, but almost all Americans will be carrying a mobile \nphone, a Blackberry, or a PDA. There are over 200 million wireless \nsubscribers in the United States.\n  This is crucial because regardless of when or where disaster strikes, \nbe it American seaports, a rail terminal, or an airport, minutes save \nlives.\n  This amendment will provide a tool for emergency managers at all \nlevels of Government--Federal, State, or local--so they can quickly and \neffectively reach all affected individuals with specific lifesaving \ninstructions. In addition to the threat posed by terrorist attacks, \nthis system, the system created by this amendment, will give our \nmanagers the ability to alert communities of other hazards such as \nnatural disasters or manmade accidents.\n  It is already funded. I worked during last year's budget \nreconciliation bill to provide $106 million for this program.\n  I urge our colleagues to vote for the amendment and move the Nation \none step forward to having a modern public safety alerting system.\n  I urge the adoption of this second-degree amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 4927) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we will shortly have a request for a vote \non this amendment, as amended. Hopefully, it will take place around \nnoon tomorrow.\n  I know of no other business we have to come before us tonight. We \nwill await the wrapup statement to be sent to us by the leader's \noffice.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, it is my understanding that either \nshortly this evening or tomorrow the Senator from South Carolina will \nbe coming to the floor to speak on the agreement that has been worked \nout among all the players, which is based on legislation he introduced, \nS. 1753, the Warning Alert and Response Network Act, the so-called WARN \nAct. This amendment would create the national alert system which will \ncontribute to a strengthened emergency management system for our \ncountry. The amendment will create a national alert office within the \nDepartment of Homeland Security and will ensure that the office will \nwork closely with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, \nNOAA, to bring together the wealth of expertise in both of these \nagencies to create an alert system that will transmit alerts in \nresponse to all threats to public safety, whether they are a terrorist \nattack, a natural disaster or a manmade accident.\n  The amendment directs this new office to develop a 21st century alert \nsystem that takes advantage of new technologies, including technologies \nto better alert underserved communities.\n  Five years ago, all of us remember the frustration of trying to get \naccurate information. Most of us found that our cell phones were no \nlonger functioning. At that point, we did not have Blackberries, and we \nhad a very difficult time communicating.\n  The legislation that Senator DeMint has authored helps to respond to \nthat need to disseminate information quickly and accurately to the \npublic using a variety of tools. The new system would use multiple \nmodes of communication, providing alerts not only by television and \nradio but also cell phones, Blackberries, and other wireless devices \nsuch as the Internet, satellite television, and other means of \ncommunication.\n  The DeMint proposal builds on the recommendations of the White House \nKatrina Report to employ all available 21st century technologies both \nto update and utilize the National Emergency Alert System in order to \nprovide the general public with advanced notification of, as well as \ninstructions during, a disaster or other emergencies.\n  We need a warning and alert system in this country that keeps pace \nwith new technologies and an increasingly mobile society. No longer is \nit adequate to depend on television and radios to disseminate \nabsolutely critical public safety information.\n  I believe that the approach in this amendment will save lives by \ncreating a system with the capability to alert individuals to dangers, \nwhether they are watching television, driving in their cars or sitting \non the beach with a cell phone and a Blackberry. Yes, some of us take \nthe Blackberry and the cell phone even when we are on the beach.\n  I thank Senator DeMint for his work on this important amendment. I \nthank the Commerce Committee, which has worked very closely with the \nHomeland Security Committee to work out some issues, and I am pleased \nto support its passage as amended by the amendment of Senator Inouye \nand Senator Stevens.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4921\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I will speak on my amendment, which is \nbased on legislation I introduced last year called the WARN Act.\n  First, I thank the managers of this legislation for their tireless \nwork, particularly Senator Collins and Senator Stevens, who have helped \nbring this amendment up for consideration.\n  America needs the world's best port security. This legislation we are \ndebating will help America get it.\n  While our Nation has come a long way in preparing for the threat \nposed by natural disasters and terrorist attack since the creation of \nthe Department of Homeland Security, there are still areas where we can \nand must do better.\n  If, God forbid, there is a successful attack at one of our ports, \nminutes will make the difference between life and death for many \ncitizens in the surrounding communities. To save lives, our first \nresponders will need the tools to immediately communicate with people \nin harm's way.\n  For decades, the emergency broadcast system has largely been the only \navailable tool. As people are increasingly on the move, getting word \nout via television and radio alone is not effective. We need to do \nmore.\n  This amendment does that by building on the foundation of the \nemergency broadcast system and bringing it into the 21st century. Over \n200 million Americans subscribe to wireless services, Blackberrys, cell \nphones or other PDAs. This amendment leverages these new mobile \ncapabilities, in addition to television and radio, to provide alerts \nthat will save lives during disasters.\n  Wireless networks have enthusiastically endorsed the WARN Act and \nlook forward to competing with each other to create the best system.\n  The need for this system is obvious. Whether it is the foiled London \nairline bombing plots or the train attacks in India, we are constantly \nreminded we must be vigilant in our efforts to secure America's \nhomeland. One year ago, terrorists brutally attacked the London subway \nsystem, killing dozens. We have since discovered that terrorists were \ntargeting commuter lines\n\n[[Page S9289]]\n\nrunning under the New York Harbor. In July, we saw terrorists in India \nkill 300 innocent men, women and children and injure over 700.\n  If the unthinkable happens and we are attacked with a chemical, \nbiological or radiological weapon, we must be prepared to respond. The \nWARN Act does this, establishing a system that represents a major \nadvance in emergency management. One of the most effective ways to save \nlives is to keep people out of the impacted areas and efficiently \nevacuate those who are already affected. Under this new system, we will \nbe able to tell some people to stay where they are if it is safe; \nothers can be given instructions to evacuate in certain directions \ndepending on their location and the direction of the wind or they could \nbe told how to avoid the impacted area all together, preventing first \nresponders from being forced to manage new victims.\n  While the system would be a crucial tool in saving lives in the event \nthat there was an attack at one of our ports, the uses of this new \nnational alerting system extend well beyond terrorists attacks, to \nmanmade or natural disasters. A year and a half ago, a town in my State \nof South Carolina was exposed to a massive chlorine gas release. The \ntrain crash that caused the release occurred at 2:39 in the morning. \nBeeping television or radio is not much help when the owner is sleeping \nand the TV and radio are silent. What could have been helpful would \nhave been if emergency managers in the area could have run the cell \nphones that were designed to turn on in emergencies so the individuals \nin the affected area could have been instructed to evacuate away from \nthe path of the chlorine cloud and get to safer ground.\n  Finally, the new system set up by the WARN Act will have significant \nimpact for the response to natural disasters. For example, in the \nMidwest, tornadoes pose a grave threat. Tornado sirens have a limited \nreach and can save some, but by leveraging the capabilities of cell \nphones, we can effectively direct individuals who are in the path of a \ntornado to take cover or get out of the way.\n  The applications are promising, as well, along the gulf and Atlantic \ncoasts, where hurricanes often make landfall. This year could still be \na strong hurricane season, with predictions of three or four major \nhurricanes category 3 or above. If one of one of these makes landfall, \nit will trigger a massive evacuation.\n  The system created by the WARN Act will provide crucial information \nto aid in evacuation and recovery. It will alert evacuees to the \nclosest shelter with beds and where water and food is being distributed \nafter the storm and what roads are not usable as evacuation routes.\n  We all hope and pray disasters--natural, manmade or terrorist--never \nhappen, but we must be prepared. Today, I ask my colleagues to join in \nsupporting this amendment.\n  Again, I thank Senator Collins and all those who have worked to bring \nup this amendment. This way we give first responders one of the more \ncrucial tools they need to save lives and secure our homeland.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I spoke earlier in favor of the amendment \nof the Senator from South Carolina. While he is here, I again commend \nhim for his effort, his leadership in this area, and for working with \nboth the Homeland Security and the Commerce Committees to work out some \ntechnical issues. His amendment is going to make a big difference. All \nof us remember 5 years ago on this day how difficult it was to get \ninformation--our cell phones were not working; we did not have \nBlackberrys then. The Senator's approach will ensure that we use every \npossible means to inform the public when there is an incident that is a \nthreat to public safety.\n  I salute the Senator for his leadership. This is an excellent \nproposal. I am pleased to support it.\n\n\n                        public safety promotion\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. I appreciate the efforts of my colleagues, Senator \nStevens, Senator DeMint, and Senator Ben Nelson, in working to build \nconsensus on the pending amendment, which will improve our Nation's \nability to transmit critical emergency information to the public in \ntimes of crisis. As we consider this amendment, however, I believe it \nis important for us to clarify that provisions in this act do not \naffect or in any way limit or impair the Federal Communications \nCommission's existing authority under the Communications Act to promote \npublic safety. As my colleagues well know, one of the most fundamental \nand significant statutory mandates of the FCC is the promotion of \nsafety of life and property through the use of wire and radio \ncommunication.\n  As a result, while section 103(f) of the amendment makes clear that \nno new regulatory authority is granted to the FCC, other than to \nregulate compliance with its provisions and as specified in subsection \n103(d) and (e), I would ask my colleague, Senator DeMint, to confirm my \nunderstanding that the amendment will have no impact on the FCC's \nexisting regulatory authority under the Communications Act to promote \npublic safety through the use of communications technologies.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I agree with the interpretation and \nunderstanding of my colleague, Senator Inouye, and thank him for his \nassistance and support in working on this amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I concur with Senator Inouye and Senator DeMint.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask consent at 12 noon tomorrow the \nSenate proceed to a vote in relation to the DeMint amendment No. 4921, \nas amended; further, that notwithstanding the adoption of the amendment \n4927, the second-degree amendment be modified to reflect a perfecting \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/11/senate-section/article/S9289-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9289]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, there are moments in every lifetime which \ndefy words. For me, those moments are the attack on Pearl Harbor, the \nday President Kennedy was assassinated, the Good Friday earthquake in \nAlaska, my own airplane crash in 1978, and the day I viewed the Exxon \nValdez oilspill. My most recent and most vivid memory is the helicopter \ntrip I took over Ground Zero with my good friend, Senator Inouye, on \nSeptember 13, 2001.\n  The total impact of what Senator Inouye and I saw just shocked the \ntwo of us. We both went through World War II and saw a lot of trauma, a \nlot of destruction. But nothing was more stark in terms of our \nmemories, particularly mine, than what I saw that day in New York. \nEmbedded in my mind then were the questions: Who would do something \nlike this? And why? We would soon learn the answers, and those answers \nchanged our Nation forever.\n  September 11, 2001, was one of our country's darkest days, but the \nworst in our enemies brought out the best in our citizens. Their \nefforts reflected the words of the author Henry James:\n\n       We work in the dark, we do what we can, we give what we \n     have.\n\n  Following those attacks, Americans did everything they could to help \nthose directly affected. Those of us in Congress almost immediately \nmade $40 billion available to initiate recovery.\n  Since then, our country has been fortunate. We have met the \nterrorists abroad rather than here on our soil, and we have \naccomplished this in a way consistent with our ideals.\n  Democracy is harder to move than a dictatorship. It moves slowly, but \nit moves surely. There is much more work left to do, but so far, we \nhave been able to prevent another massive terrorist attack on our \ncountry.\n  The terrorists who attacked us 5 years ago thought they could defeat \nus. They questioned our resolve and our dedication to our principles. \nThey were wrong. Our resolve is strong, and it has brought about a \ndifferent response than the terrorists anticipated. The past 5 years \nhave been a proving ground for our country's courage and commitment.\n\n[[Page S9290]]\n\n  Today I am reminded of the words once spoken by President Reagan. He \nsaid this:\n\n       Perhaps you and I have lived with this miracle too long to \n     be properly appreciative. Freedom is a fragile thing and is \n     never more than one generation from extinction. It is not \n     ours by inheritance; it must be fought for and defended \n     constantly by each generation, for it comes only once to a \n     people. Those who have known freedom, and then lost it, have \n     never known it again.\n\n  Today we pause to remember those we have lost over the past 5 years, \nmen and women who sacrificed everything so that this miracle, the great \nAmerican experiment, could continue. Our thoughts and prayers are with \nthem and with their families. And we will remember forever September \n11.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today, our Nation honors the memory of \nthose who were killed in the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. \nWe also pay tribute to the heroism of the first responders who \nselflessly risked, and even gave, their lives in the rescue and \nrecovery missions that followed those horrific attacks. Five years \nafter that tragic day, we still remember their tremendous bravery, and \nwe remember the simple acts of kindness that Americans all over the \ncountry displayed as they donated equipment for the first responders, \nobserved moments of silence, or flew the flag in a show of patriotism \nand unity. Each of these acts, however large or small, contributed to \nour Nation's recovery. Let us not forget the great strength of spirit \nthat guided Americans through that difficult time as we move forward, \nbound together by our faith in this great and free Nation.\n  As we mark this solemn day, let us also rededicate ourselves to \ndefeating the terrorists who continue to threaten us. This should not \nbe a partisan issue every Senator wants to protect our country and \nevery American wants to defeat the terrorists who attacked us. This \nmust be our top priority, and we must strive to regain the unity and \nresolve that bound us together after 9/11 as we show the terrorists how \nbadly they have underestimated the strength and resilience of the \nAmerican people.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the approaching \nfifth anniversary of the terrorist attacks against our Nation.\n  I still vividly remember that morning. When my chief of staff came to \ntell me about the attacks on the World Trade Center, I was in a meeting \non how to improve our 911 emergency response system to better suit the \nneeds of our first responders in rural areas. Even then we knew right \naway that our country would be forever changed.\n  The events of September 11 undoubtedly remain etched into the memory \nof every American. Five years later we are reminded daily of the \nprofound impact that fateful morning had on our great Nation. Although \ndeliberation and debate continues all across the county and in this \nbody to determine the best way to keep our Nation safe, as we approach \nthe anniversary of 9/11 we must commemorate and pray for those who lost \ntheir lives, for their surviving loved ones, and for the brave men and \nwomen serving in our Armed Forces around the world protecting our \nfreedoms.\n  I said it the day after the tragedy here on the floor of the Senate, \nand I still believe it: America is strong. No terrorist strike will \nundermine our country to a point that would make us lose our \nfundamental purpose as a nation and a people.\n  We as a nation have adjusted to a new way of life since that day. We \nunderstand that these measures have changed our lives slightly but not \nour way of life. Increased security at airports, a transformed homeland \nsecurity position, and a new national intelligence apparatus are but a \nfew of the changes we have made in combating the new war of the 21st \ncentury.\n  After that day in 2001, many of us in elected service had to answer \n``what happens next?'' We knew then that the phrase ``war on terror'' \nhad been used lightly before and that this war had been ongoing before \nSeptember 11. But our eyes were opened that day, and our strategic \noutlook was dramatically altered. President Bush has called it the long \nwar, and I agree with him. We are in a struggle for survival against a \nfaceless enemy who uses terror as a weapon against civilians anywhere, \nanytime.\n  It is this reality that has driven our foreign policy for the last 5 \nyears and will continue to define how we fight against terror abroad. \nThis is a different kind of war than what we have confronted before. \nNot only will we have to fight terrorists on the battlefield but also \nin urban areas, cyberspace, and over the airwaves. Not only are we \nfighting with bullets but also with ideas. Our greatest export \ncontinues to be freedom and democracy, and it will be these tools, not \nforce, that will eventually lead us to victory.\n\n  But any victory we have will be hard fought. Our enemy is a radical \nnetwork of terrorists that can flourish anywhere in the world. The \nterrorists' directive commands them to kill Christians and Jews, to \nkill all Americans, and make no distinction among military and \ncivilians, including women and children.\n  It is with this knowledge that we approach the global war on terror. \nAfter September 11, we could not sit back and wait for the terrorists \nto strike again. On the contrary, our President, with congressional \nbacking, ordered our Government to go on the offensive. We have shut \ndown sanctuaries of terror in Iraq and Afghanistan. We have cut off the \nterror financing, and we have worked with our friends and allies to \ntrack down and apprehend terror operatives wherever they may be. We \nhave had many such successes against terrorism since 9/11.\n  In the past, we would combat terrorism mostly using law enforcement \nmechanisms. We now combat these terrorists by taking the fight to them \nwith our international partners using every available resource.\n  Some of these resources come from our intelligence community. Prior \nto September 11, our intelligence and law enforcement communities were \nrestricted from sharing certain information with one another. \nThankfully, today our counterterrorism efforts are more comprehensive, \nand these barriers no longer exist.\n  Al-Qaida used to train thousands of terrorists in Afghanistan under \nthe nose of the international community without any repercussions to \nthe organization or the Taliban. Thankfully, no longer is Afghanistan a \nsafe haven for those brewing plots against our Nation. The Afghan \npeople have been freed from the oppressive Taliban and fight with us \nside-by-side in the war on terror.\n  Additionally, Iraq was governed by a mass-murderer and a state \nsponsor of terror and now boasts for the first time a democratically \nelected government.\n  Of course, none of this could have been attained without the men and \nwomen of the armed services. Many of these servicemen have sacrificed \neverything to protect our freedoms abroad. Yet while the cost has been \nhigh, the cost of doing nothing would be even greater. Our country \ncontinues to mourn for the men and women who have lost their lives \nwhile on duty in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other parts of the globe.\n  Despite the many difficulties in this war, our Armed Forces have not \nretreated nor walked away in the face of adversity. They continue to \nseek out terrorists to disrupt their plans of horror both in the Middle \nEast and elsewhere. They also continue to provide support and guidance \nto the Iraqi and Afghani people in their newborn democracies. Our \ncitizens in uniform have taken the battle to the enemy and achieved \nsuccess.\n  As we mourn the victims lost on September 11 and the Americans who \nhave lost their lives since that day protecting us, let us remember \nthat we are all Americans and must continue to remain committed to \nprotecting what we hold dear. We will never forget the events of \nSeptember 11. It will forever be a harsh reminder of the intentions of \nour enemies who detest freedom and democracy.\n  That said, we must also never forget what we witnessed in the days \nfollowing this tragedy as America came together for the greater good. \nFrom that experience we learned that we as Americans are much more \nunited than not. Much has changed since that fateful day of September \n11, but our country has emerged prepared for the new challengers of the \n21st century. Let us remember those who lost their lives that day and \nnever forget why we fight abroad today.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I wish to take a few minutes to reflect \nupon\n\n[[Page S9291]]\n\none of our Nation's most trying hours. Five years ago, our Nation \nembarked on the greatest test of its courage and mettle since the \n``greatest generation'' rose to the challenge of defending freedom in \nWorld War II from the forces of hatred and fascism.\n  As the 9/11 Commission observed, the morning of Tuesday, September \n11, 2001, was a beautiful morning in New York and here in Washington, \nDC, before the peace was shattered. None of us will forget those hours \nthat morning, hours which saw our Nation face unimaginable tragedy. \nThis defining moment awoke within every American the grim knowledge \nthat we are a nation at war with hatred and fear and that we must rise \nto the challenge. Each of us will remember where we were, what we were \ndoing, when America turned to face this new challenge with sorrow and \nresolve.\n  In the morning hours of September 11, starting at 8:46 a.m., we \nexperienced the 21st century's ``Pearl Harbor'' moment. Americans stood \ntransfixed by the images we saw unfolding before us: the brutal \nviolence of intolerance and the unimaginable courage of our heroes on \nthe ground and in the air striving valiantly to prevent it. By 10:38 \na.m., America began to truly understand the scope of what had happened: \nthe thousands of innocent Americans lost, the destruction of the Twin \nTowers and damage to the Pentagon, the dawning of a new age in our \nNation's proud history.\n  Each American grappled to understand this moment in history as it \nunfolded before us, trying to make sense of senselessness. As a nation, \nwe continue to struggle with it each day. Like all Americans, I have \nspent many hours seeking meaning from and understanding of the events \nof September 11, 2001. It has not been an easy task, nor will it ever \nbe completed.\n  But we know the importance of remembering those who are not here with \nus now--the innocent passengers aboard those four planes and in the \nTowers and the Pentagon; the courageous first responders who charged \ninto the chaos to try to save their fellow man; the brave \nservicemembers who have given their lives around the world to protect \nthe freedoms we continue to enjoy, to engage our enemies wherever they \nmay run and hide.\n  The people who perished during the September 11 attacks were not \nsimply victims: they were mothers and fathers, brothers and sisters, \nsons and daughters, husbands and wives, and friends and neighbors. We \nremember them for the shared jokes and laughter, the debates and \nchallenges, the quarrels and sometimes heart-wrenching disagreements, \nthe fellowship and love of family that bind us together.\n  Mr. President, 9/11 represented a crossroads for our Nation: we had \nthe choice between fear and hope, between appealing to our higher \nangels and succumbing to our darkest demons. A year from now, children \nstarting kindergarten will never have known a world before 9/11. It is \nmy greatest hope that a century from now, when schoolchildren look back \non 9/11, it will be viewed not as the beginning of a time of darkness \nover our democracy but as the clarion call for us to protect and defend \nthe fundamental rights and liberties we enjoy, a rallying to the \nfundamental beliefs that we as Americans hold so dear. It is the least \nwe can do, out of respect for those who left us that day.\n  Those lost to us on September 11 and the struggles afterwards shall \nnever be forgotten. They remain in our hearts, the source of our \nresolve. As we have in the past, America shall meet this challenge with \nhonor, wisdom, and an unbreakable spirit. As a nation, we recommit \nourselves to never giving in to those who would misrepresent faith to \nspread hate, fear, and violence. We know that the gifts bestowed upon \nus are the gifts of faith, hope, and love. We shall eschew the \npoliticking of fear and instead choose the unity of purpose that our \ntimes require.\n  Five years after that day, our Nation recommits itself to remembering \nthe tremendous loss we suffered as a country. We seek to honor the \nsacrifices made on September 11 by renewing our faith in America \nitself. I stand here as sure today as I was when I went to sleep on the \nnight of September 10, 2001, that it is the promise of our common goals \nof hope and progress, not fear and violence, that deliver freedom and \nsecurity both at home and across the globe, for all people.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today, across my great State of Maine and \nthroughout America, in countless ceremonies--public and private, in \ntestaments--planned and spontaneous, and in towns of every size and \nstripe, we commemorate with mutual solemnity the fifth anniversary of a \nday born out of inconsolable and unimaginable loss as well as \nunconquerable spirit and ennobling service September 11, 2001.\n  As we pause to mourn those who have passed from us and as we confront \nonce again unspeakable acts of barbarism and horror, we cannot help but \nfind abundant comfort, solace, inspiration, and pride in the eternal \nimages and remembrances of heroism and sacrifice on that terrible day.\n  Through what President Lincoln once eloquently phrased as the \n``mystic chords of memory,'' we share in reverent and heart-wrenching \nmoments of silence and find a unifying kinship with those who convene \nat Ground Zero in lower Manhattan, at the Pentagon, and in Shanksville, \nPA. And regardless of our circumstance, location, and occupation, we \ncast aside our differences, agendas, and personal and individual \npursuits, to place into action and live out the immortal words of our \nFounding Fathers that reverberate throughout the halls of Congress as \nwell as the annals of our history: E Pluribus Unum, or ``Out of Many, \nOne.'' Out of the ashes of destruction, we become one Nation, \nindivisible.\n  At the same time, we are not immune to feeling a panoply of \nemotions--patriotism, pride, anger--as well as a persistent, gnawing \ndisbelief that such calculated savagery could exist in the world and \ncould be perpetrated so brutally and ruthlessly against innocent \npeople. And those feelings intensify when we put faces and names with \nthe long line of those who perished. It becomes especially personal \nwhen we reflect upon the Mainers whom we have lost. We grieved then--\nand we feel a deep, inescapable sorrow now for the tragedy that befell \nAnna Allison, Carol Flyzik, Robert Jalbert, Jacqueline Norton, Robert \nNorton, James Roux, Robert Schlegel, and Stephen Ward. Our thoughts and \nprayers remain--as they have for the last 5 years and as they will \nalways--with their families and loved ones.\n  While we forever honor their memory, we also understand that the \ngreatest memorial is to embrace all that we have retained as a nation--\nour strength, our sense of purpose, and our veneration of the \nprinciples of liberty and justice--even and especially in tumultuous \ntimes.\n  Let us remember how that one day in September not only changed \nAmerica and the world but also reminded us of what really matters--of \nthe tenets and people we should value and what true heroes really look \nlike. I recall those passengers who, when faced with the horrible \ncertainty of their circumstances, brought down United Airlines flight \n93 to save the lives of others--not to mention the very symbols of our \ndemocracy, the Capitol and the White House.\n  On this poignant occasion, we celebrate those heroes who walk among \nus today while the legacy of those who perished on 9/11 echoes \nthroughout New York, Washington DC, Pennsylvania, and every town and \ncity in this land. And we revere the indelible and exemplary \ncontributions of all first responders on 9/11 and those made daily \nthroughout our Nation by firefighters, police officers, rescue workers, \nand Americans who are ever-capable of performing extraordinary deeds.\n  We are also mindful of our military men and women who protect and \ndefend our way of life. Whether on American shores and soil or around \nthe globe, their steadfast sense of duty is an inspiration to us all. \nAs we herald the supreme actions of the past, we must remain \nunrelenting in our focus on the trials and tribulations of the present \nand the future. The plot foiled by British authorities this past summer \nwas a chilling reminder that underscores the lurking and merciless \nthreat we face--and that we cannot afford to yield to the call of \ncomplacency. Just as our enemies have proved they are ever-patient, so \nmust we prove we are ever-vigilant.\n  We come together on days of remembrance such as 9/11 to draw strength \nfrom those who are with us and from the memories of those who are not. \nWe\n\n[[Page S9292]]\n\nrecognize the remarkable and munificent valor of fallen friends, \nfamily, and fellow countrymen whose valiant example binds us to them \nand their noble heritage--and binds us to each other today--and into a \nfuture more illumined by their selfless deeds on our behalf.\n  That sentiment brings to mind a great son of Maine, GEN Joshua \nChamberlain, who, in 1889, said the following upon dedicating the \nMonument to the 20th Maine that he so nobly commanded at the Battle of \nGettysburg:\n\n       In great deeds something abides. On great fields something \n     stays. Forms change and pass. Bodies disappear. But spirits \n     linger to consecrate ground for the vision-place of souls. \n     And reverent men and women from afar, and generations that \n     know us not and that we know not of, heart-drawn to see where \n     and by whom great things were suffered and done for them . . \n     . And lo! the shadow of a mighty presence shall wrap them in \n     its bosom, and the power of the vision pass into their souls.\n\n  It is that power of vision that we have in common that draws us \ntogether today. From that it surely follows the outpouring of respect \nand admiration that testifies to a solitary and solemn truth--that time \nwill never, ever, dim the glorious deeds that were done in the face of \nheinous evil.\n  The morning of September 11, 2001, began with such beautiful blue \nskies but ended with a nation in grief-stricken desolation and stunned \nshock. In Washington, DC, I watched the images along with the rest of \nthe world.\n  Later, as the sun set over the National Mall--still capped by smoke \nbillowing from the wound in the side of the Pentagon--I will never \nforget joining with my colleagues in the House and Senate on the \nCapitol steps to sing ``God Bless America.'' We sang to send a message \nto the country and to the world that we would never be deterred--that \nfreedom is forged by something much more resolute than any act of \nterror.\n  Recalling all that September 11 represents--the tragedies and the \ntriumphs--how it revealed the better angels of our nature for the world \nto see in our hour of calamitous attack, despair, and fear, we must \nunequivocally resolve on this day--and every day--that we will bring \nthe fight to the enemy, will not falter in our unwavering commitment, \nwe will persevere, and most of all, we will and must prevail.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, today is a day of remembrance, a day of \nremembrance here in America and around the globe. Five years ago today, \non a clear September morning, serenity was broken by death and \ndestruction.\n  What happened in New York, in Washington, and in Pennsylvania that \nday we will never forget.\n  We will never forget the nearly 3,000 people whose lives were lost on \nthat day; we will never forget their families; and we will continue to \nhonor their lives by defending our freedom and fighting against all \nthose who wish our Nation harm.\n  Much has happened in the last 5 years since September 11, 2001. Our \nGovernment has responded in a variety of ways.\n  So that we could better ``connect the dots'' in the future, the \nDepartment of Homeland Security was established, and later, a Director \nof National Intelligence was put into place so that our intelligence \ncommunity could work together more seamlessly.\n  Numerous security upgrades have been put into place across our \ncountry, new technologies have been developed and implemented to curb \nthe advances of terrorists, and we are safer now than we were then.\n  Over the last 5 years, we have waged an unprecedented and global \ncampaign against terrorism. America is safer because we have had the \nPATRIOT Act. Our families are safer because we have had the \nsurveillance necessary to make sure that those who are speaking on \ntelephones with al-Qaida operatives overseas are being monitored.\n  Our Nation is safer because we have pursued, captured, and \ninterrogated terrorists and used that information to capture other, \nhigh-ranking al-Qaida leaders. We are safer because we have had the \nleadership, tenacity, and the opportunity to pursue terrorists wherever \nthey may go.\n  Our campaign against terrorism has been done in a comprehensive way \nwith cooperation from other countries and it has been done utilizing \nall the power that the State has, not only militarily but through the \nsurveillance of terrorist training camps, a strong diplomatic front \nworking with our allies, and through financial means watching and \nseizing the bank accounts from where terrorists draw their resources.\n  Our comprehensive efforts are about keeping America safe. As we \nremember those who died on 9/11, we also must remember that we are not \nsafe yet.\n  We are safer. We have been kept safe, but we must continue the \nvigilance, we must continue the determined campaign against terrorists \nand the states that sponsor terrorism.\n  Thanks to the faithful leadership and resolve of all those that serve \nto protect us, especially our Armed Forces who give so much, no other \nattacks have occurred on American soil to date. We must continue to \ndefend freedom here at home and abroad. As a Member of the Senate, I \nwill continue to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and \nin both Houses of Congress to make sure that we continue to devote the \nnecessary resources to this continuing mission.\n  As our President said on that mournful day 5 years ago, ``A great \npeople has been moved to defend a great nation. Terrorist attacks can \nshake the foundations of our biggest buildings, but they cannot touch \nthe foundation of America. These acts shattered steel, but they cannot \ndent the steel of American resolve.''\n  Our Nation will never forget those lost on September 11, 2001, and we \ncan demonstrate our continued commitment to their lives and memories \nthrough our unending defense of Democracy and our blessed and beloved \nUnited States of America.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, 5 years ago we saw the face of evil cross \nour shores as a band of terrorists took control of four planes and used \nour own technology against us to kill thousands of our fellow citizens. \nPlotting in secrecy and under the cover of darkness, in caves in the \nremote hills of Afghanistan, these terrorists planned to kill as many \nAmericans as they could, destroying some carefully selected buildings \nthat, to them, symbolized our Nation and our unique way of life.\n  We all remember that day with great clarity and we will never forget \nwhere we were and what we were doing when we heard the news--a plane \nhad crashed into one of the Trade Towers in what appeared to be a \ntragic accident. Then, a second plane struck the other tower. It was \nthen clear that this was no accident. We were under attack.\n  In the moments that followed a nation looked on in horror as we saw \nthe face of bravery and courage under fire as the men and women of New \nYork's police and fire departments responded to the attack in New York. \nThey battled long and hard, against the odds, to come to the aid of \nthose who were trapped in the towers. Sadly, in the effort to save \nthose who were in desperate trouble, many of those first responders \nwere also trapped in the towers as they weakened, and ultimately \ncollapsed.\n  As we watched events continue to unfold in New York, we heard reports \nthat another plane had hit the Pentagon and caused a considerable \namount of damage to the building and claimed the lives of many of those \nwho were working there. Then came the news that a fourth plane had \ncrashed in a lonely field in Pennsylvania. Suddenly the attack took on \nmassive proportions as we looked with fear and trepidation to the skies \nand wondered if there were more planes headed for additional targets \nthroughout the country.\n  In the days that followed, the story behind the events became clear. \nThe attack was orchestrated by a terrorist group that was led by Osama \nbin Laden. Three planes had hit their targets. The passengers on the \nfourth, made aware of the fate of the other three planes by friends and \nloved ones on their cell phones, had launched their own attack on the \nhijackers and they were able to take control of the plane and stop the \nhijackers from using it to destroy another landmark and kill more \nAmericans in a crowded city. The brave men and women on that flight had \nsacrificed their own lives so that others might be spared.\n  Those are the bare details, a brief outline of some of what happened \nthat day. It was a day that had a great impact on every American--and \nit hit us all on a deeply personal level. Ask anyone and you will see \nthat we all have\n\n[[Page S9293]]\n\nour own story, our own recollection of what happened on September 11 \nand what it meant to us. We aren't unique in that. The Trade Center was \na global marketplace, so people from all over the world also have their \nown story to tell about that day, especially those who lost friends and \nloved ones in the attacks on the Trade Center and the Pentagon.\n  When it is written, history will make it clear that September 11 was \nmore than an American tragedy. It was the beginning of a global \nnightmare.\n  It has now been 5 years since the day the towers fell and with the \npassage of time has come study after study, investigations, and other \nattempts to make some sense of everything that happened that day. There \nwere failures of some systems to work at their peak efficiency, and \nthere were warnings that, with hindsight, should have been handled \ndifferently. The important thing now is not to place blame and point \nfingers, but to ensure we are fully and adequately protected so we \ndon't have to experience another September 11.\n  As I prepared my remarks for this day, I thought about my young \ngrandson, now 3 years old. He is a wonderful addition to my life and he \ncontinues to give me an added perspective to the events I see on the \nnews every night. I know someday he will ask me about that day. When he \ndoes, I hope I am able to find the right words to explain to him about \nthe courage and the bravery of all those who worked so hard to try to \nsave the lives of those who were in danger that day. I hope I can help \nhim understand the reasons why our brave service men and women are \nfighting on the front lines of the war on terror to keep him safe. It \nwon't be easy for his is a world of peace and innocence and far removed \nfrom the hatred that drove the events of that day.\n  Still, no matter what I tell him, I know he will ask me why these \nthings happen. His grampa will tell him that this is a world full of so \nmany good things--like his parents who love him so very dearly, and the \nthings he loves to do, like go fishing with his grampa. Unfortunately, \nit is also a world where people preach anger and hatred and try to harm \npeople they don't even know.\n  If it is a hard lesson for us to learn, you can imagine how difficult \nit will be for a small child. How to talk to our children about \nSeptember 11 was a problem when it happened, and it will continue to be \nso as we work to put an end to terrorism around the globe, wherever it \nexists.\n  Ultimately, that will be the legacy of September 11. We were cruelly \nattacked on that day, by a group that underestimated our resolve as a \nnation and our will as individuals to right the great wrong that had \nbeen done to us. Today, 5 years later, we stand united, still strongly \ncommitted to putting an end to the threat of terrorism, wherever it \nappears. We didn't start this battle, but our Armed Forces will, once \nagain, put an end to it.\n  Five years ago the world stood still, and it was changed forever. The \nripples begun on September 11 continue to have repercussions that draw \nus back to that day almost constantly. As we remember the events of \nthat dark, sad day, we pause to remember all those who lost their \nlives, especially their families and their loved ones. Our thoughts and \nprayers are constantly with you. We remember the fireman, police and \nrescue squads who responded to the sites of the attacks and performed \nwith great bravery. The concern they showed for others and the \nsacrifices they made to try to save anyone they could will never be \nforgotten. And, we remember our servicemen and women who stand guard \naround the world, defending our precious freedoms and our way of life. \nWe owe them all a debt we will never be able to repay for the \nsacrifices they continue to make on our behalf.\n  Today we rededicate ourselves to the work that must be done to make \nour Nation stronger, safer and more secure so that our world will be a \nbetter place for us all to live. It will be difficult and it will \nrequire us all to play a part in the effort to rid the world of the \nthreat of terror. It will ultimately be the legacy we will leave to \nthose who will follow us--a world in which everyone is able to live in \npeace and freedom and without fear.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, five years after the terrorist attacks \nof September 11, we still feel the pain and loss of that terrible day. \nWe will always honor the memory and spirit of those who lost their \nlives and those who gave their lives for others.\n  Our Nation's most enduring values were attacked on that day. We have \na responsibility to those who died, to their families, and to the first \nresponders who answered the call of duty without hesitation, to never \nforget and to never let this tragedy be repeated. Together we have a \nresponsibility to all Americans to keep our Nation secure and our \ncitizens safe.\n  Yet, 5 years after our cities were attacked, America is still not as \nsecure as it should be. We must take the hard lessons from that \ndevastating attack and confront the new challenges of a changing world. \nWe must continue fighting for the tough, smart policies that will make \nour communities safer.\n  We have a lot of work ahead of us. Our vast transportation systems \nremain vulnerable. Our borders are porous.\n  To protect America, we must secure our ports, improve intelligence \noversight, share information effectively, and allocate resources based \non risk. We must fully implement the 9/11 Commission recommendations, \nimprove nuclear material tracking, and strengthen our diplomacy around \nthe world. We must deliver better support to our first responders to \nhelp them do their jobs.\n  In the aftermath of September 11, our Nation came together. Five \nyears later, we must remember those we have lost, their courage and \nbrave spirits, and once again, move forward together to better protect \nour communities and defend the freedom we cherish.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \ninnocent Americans who were killed in the terrorist attacks of \nSeptember 11, 2001. I ask that we commemorate the emergency responders \nwho provided relief in the aftermath of the attacks. I finally ask that \nwe salute our brave men and women in uniform who have volunteered to \nserve their country in this time of need.\n  I offer my condolences to the family of Al Marchand from Alamogordo, \nNM, a flight attendant on United Airlines flight 175 and one of the \nfirst casualties on this horrific day. Since that day, many New \nMexicans have volunteered to serve their country by entering the ranks \nof our Armed Forces. Some lost their lives in this war to protect our \nway of life. I will ask that the attached Associated Press article \ncontaining the names of these proud soldiers be printed into the \nCongressional Record. I also will pay tribute to LTC Marshall A. \nGutierrez and LCpl Shane P. Harris, the two most recent casualties from \nNew Mexico in the ongoing global war on terror.\n  Five years have passed since al-Qaida terrorists struck our homeland. \nThe images and shock of that day are still with me. To this day, I am \nsaddened by our losses, but I am also heartened by all the heroic acts \nof our citizens in what was the most shocking attack on our homeland. \nIn the months following the attacks, our brave soldiers toppled the \nregime in Afghanistan that provided a base of operations for the \nterrorists who carried out the 2001 attacks. We helped that country \nestablish a democratic government and are working with allies in NATO \nto bring peace and stability to a country that has spent much of its \nrecent history in the strife of civil war.\n  One of the important lessons political and military leaders learned \nfrom the 2001 terrorist attacks was that America cannot stand by idly \nas threats to its security develop far from our shores. This required \nour intelligence and law enforcement agencies to work with friends and \nallies around the world and with each other to gather actionable \nintelligence that would help us disrupt terrorist plots at home and \nabroad. To help consolidate our domestic defense system, the Congress \ncreated the Department of Homeland Security. The Department of Homeland \nSecurity was organized to prevent attacks within the United States, \nreduce America's vulnerability to terrorism, and to minimize the damage \nand assist in the recovery from terrorists attacks in America. The \nCongress also followed the recommendations of the National Commission \non Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, the 9/11 Commission. and \npassed historic legislation that reformed the agencies that make up our \nintelligence community. While these\n\n[[Page S9294]]\n\nreforms were important and necessary, the disruption of a recent plot \nto hijack planes flying from London to the United States shows us that \nour enemies are still bent on bringing terror into our cities.\n  Many of my fellow citizens from the State of New Mexico have \ncontributed to strengthening our defenses in the global war on terror. \nAn urban rescue team traveled from New Mexico to Virginia to help \nrecover survivors from the ruins at the Pentagon. Sandia and Los Alamos \nNational Laboratories helped identify the strains of anthrax that were \nfound in Government office buildings shortly after the terrorist \nattacks. They helped develop a biological threat detection system that \nwas deployed at the 2002 Winter Olympics, the 2004 Summer Olympics, and \nin locations around our Nation's Capital. The national labs have also \nbeen at the forefront in developing tools to detect and dispose of \nmaterials that can be used as a ``dirty bomb'' or other weapon of mass \ndestruction. Finally, the National Infrastructure and Analysis Center--\nNISAC--is being used to develop response strategies for government \nofficials and first responders for large and complex crises.\n  Over the past 5 years, we have learned a good deal more about how the \nattack was planned and executed, and we have spent countless man hours \nand resources to make our Nation safer. We can be proud of the fact \nthat we have worked to implement most of the 9/11 Commission \nrecommendations. We are more prepared as a Nation for these types of \ndangers than we were prior to September 11, 2001. But this is a \nstruggle that will not end with the same clarity and decisiveness of \nbattles past. So as we continue to adjust to the new sense of normal, I \nhope all Americans take time to reflect on the events of September 11, \n2001, honor those who have fallen, and rededicate themselves for the \nstruggle ahead.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article to which I \nreferred be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     [From the Associated Press State & Local Wire, August 8, 2006]\n\n              New Mexicans Killed in Iraq and Afghanistan\n\n                       (By the Associated Press)\n\n       A list of New Mexico soldiers and Marines killed in Iraq \n     and Afghanistan:\n       Killed in Iraq:\n       Army Spc.

Mr. President, 5 years ago, the Nation woke up to a crisp \nand sunny fall day and went to bed in a world forever changed. We lost \nso much that day--3000 lives, a skyline, a sense of safety in our \nhomes, our comforting ignorance of the stark face of evil. Since 9/11, \nwe have tried to heal, to remember with honor those we lost. And we \nhave tried to make real the false security we felt that crisp September \nmorning before the first plane hit.\n  We have--and will continue to--debate what America has become since \n9/11. We need to figure out if we are safer, if we have sacrificed too \nmuch freedom for security, if we have paid too little to bolster the \nfirst responders, if we have fought the wrong war in Iraq, if we \nhaven't done the right work in Afghanistan. These questions should and \nmust be answered.\n  But today, we need to put aside our considerable differences and \nrecall the common, deep wound every American suffered on 9/11. Our \nsorrow, anger, and shock were not partisan; we were united in our \noutrage and unified in our resolve. As we remember today who and what \nwe lost on 9/11, we must also remember the love we share for who and \nwhat we are in America. That is what was attacked that September \nmorning--and that is what can bring us together to build a more secure \nAmerica.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today marks the fifth anniversary of the \nvicious attack on America by al-Qaida terrorists. Despite the passage \nof time, Americans still vividly recall with enormous pain and sorrow \nthat dark and somber day.\n  We honor the nearly 3,000 innocent Americans who lost their lives \nthat\n\n[[Page S9295]]\n\nday. We recall the brave firefighters and first responders who \nsacrificed their lives so that others could live.\n  We vividly remember the images on television of the Twin Towers \ncrumbling before our eyes. We could see from our office windows the \nplume of smoke rising from the Pentagon, and we realized that but for \nthe grace of God and courage of the passengers on flight 93, the \nCapitol buildings and many of us could have met that same fate.\n  We recall the pledge by all Americans that this type of attack will \nnever, ever occur again. We recall how all of us in Congress came \ntogether in common purpose.\n  And we recall the enormous outpouring of support from the entire \nworld, which stood by us and reassured us, saying so eloquently, \n``Today, we are all Americans.''\n  More than 200 sons and daughters of Massachusetts perished in that \ntragedy. I will ask that their names be printed in the Record. Today, \nmore than ever, our thoughts and prayers are with them and their \nfamilies and friends whose lives were changed forever on that tragic \nday.\n  Although their loved ones will never be brought back, I hope the \nwords of Abraham Lincoln will provide a measure of solace on this \nanniversary--``We here highly resolve that those dead shall not have \ndied in vain, that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of \nfreedom; and that government of the people, by the people, and for the \npeople, shall not perish from the earth.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the list of names to \nwhich I referred to be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     =Stephen G.

Mr. President, I rise to express my sympathy over the loss \nof Nebraska Army National Guard Sergeant Germaine Debro of Omaha, NE. \nSergeant Debro died when an improvised explosive device detonated near \nhis vehicle near Balad, Iraq on September 4. He was 33 years old.\n  The son of a retired U.S. Air Force technical sergeant, Sergeant \nDebro and his family moved frequently around the country. Sergeant \nDebro attended Omaha Benson High School for 1 year and then moved to \nArkansas where he graduated from high school in 1991.\n  In October 1994, Sergeant Debro enlisted in the U.S. Army. Following \nhis service in the Army, Sergeant Debro enlisted in the Nebraska Army \nNational Guard in October 1997. He was assigned to Detachment 1, Troop \nB, 1-167th Cavalry Squadron based in Wahoo, NE. Sergeant Debro remained \nin Wahoo until being reassigned to the Fremont, Nebraska-based Troop B, \n1-167th Cavalry Squadron in January 2001. While serving with the 1-\nl67th Cavalry Squadron, Sergeant Debro was mobilized for several \noverseas deployment including service in Kuwait in 2001 and in Bosnia-\nHerzegovina from 2002-2003. Sergeant Debro will be remembered as a \nloyal soldier who had a strong sense of duty, honor and love of \ncountry. Thousands of brave Americans like Sergeant Debro are currently \nserving in Iraq.\n  Sergeant Debro is survived by his parents, Alvin and Priscilla Debro; \nand brothers, Alvin Jr., who served in the U.S. Army, and Maurice, all \nof Omaha. Our thoughts and prayers are with them at this difficult \ntime. America is proud of Sergeant Debro's heroic service and mourns \nhis loss.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me and all Americans in honoring SGT \nGermaine L. Debro.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/11/senate-section/article/S9296-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9296-S9297]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 DARFUR\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, we are at a crossroads in the 3-year-old \nconflict raging in Sudan's Darfur region. Last week's Security Council \nResolution 1706, authorizing a United Nations peacekeeping force for \nDarfur, represents the culmination of persistent advocacy for a robust \ninternational intervention and offers the resources and mandate \nnecessary to bring an end to violence which has already taken more than \n200,000 lives and forced an estimated 2.5 million Darfurians from their \nhomes.\n  Unfortunately, the Government of Sudan has rejected the U.N.'s plan \nand is actively undermining peace efforts while exacerbating the \nhumanitarian situation. The Sudanese Government's behavior increasingly \nviolates both international law and the terms of the Peace Agreement it \nsigned in May.\n  If the Sudanese Government remains on its current trajectory, \ndisaster--perhaps on the scale of the 1994 Rwandan genocide--is \nimminent. The current 7,000-member African Union Mission in Sudan, \nwhich has been struggling valiantly to protect innocent civilians for 2 \nyears, is set to withdraw at the end of this month. If it is not \nreplaced by a U.N. force at that time or given an extended and expanded \nmandate, a power vacuum will result that many agree would lead to a \nresurgence in violence from all sides.\n  Already, the future of the peace process is at risk and increasing \ninsecurity are leading humanitarian aid organizations to retreat from \nthe areas where their services are needed most. More than a dozen aid \nworkers have been murdered since the Darfur Peace Agreement was signed \nin May.\n  It is time for the United States and the international community to \nuse all means of influence at their disposal to ensure that U.N. \nResolution 1706 is implemented. In contrast to the small African Union \ncontingent, which is severely limited in both what it is able and \nallowed to do, the recently-authorized United Nations force would \ninclude up to 22,500 U.N. troops and police officers and an immediate \ninjection of air, engineering, and communication support for the \nAfrican Union force. The resolution, passed unanimously by the Security \nCouncil on August 31, also gives the U.N. peacekeepers power to take \nall necessary measures to protect humanitarian aid workers and civilian \npopulations.\n  In an affront to international law and the international community, \nSudan's envoys refused to attend last week's United Nations meetings \nand the Government has rejected the introduction of a U.N. peacekeeping \nforce, likening it to ``western colonization.'' Most recently, the \nGovernment has issued an ultimatum to the African Union, demanding that \nit refrain from incorporating U.N. reinforcements or withdraw its \npeacekeepers from the country. The Sudanese Government insists that it \nwill defeat rebel groups in Darfur on its own and has announced \nintentions to move more than 10,000 troops to the region. In effect, \nthis amounts to sending the same soldiers who displaced Darfur's \nrefugees to protect them.\n  Over the past week, there has been a military buildup in Darfur, with \nwitnesses reporting an influx of Sudanese military equipment and \ntroops, which is in direct violation of May's Darfur Peace Agreement. \nIn fact, while the Security Council was debating how to end the \nviolence in Darfur, the Sudanese military was indiscriminately bombing \nrebel-held villages. Firsthand sources report flight crews rolling \nbombs off plane ramps, a tactic often practiced by Government forces in \ntheir 21-year civil war to devastate whole areas of southern Sudan, \nwith nightmarish consequences for civilians.\n  Meanwhile, the situation on the ground is deteriorating rapidly. The \nmore than 2 million refugees in Darfur and neighboring Chad--two thirds \nof them children--are particularly susceptible to malaria, diarrhea, \nand other health problems and live in fear of forced recruitment by \nrebel fighters or bomb attacks by the military. This current escalation \nin instability seriously impedes the mobility of humanitarian \norganizations, preventing them from reaching civilians in Sudan's most \ndangerous areas. The World Food Program reports that its existing food \nrations--upon which some 6 million Sudanese rely--will run out in \nJanuary, adding another dimension of desperation.\n  In unanimously passing Resolution 1706, the international community \nhas delivered a clear message to the Government in Khartoum that it \nneeds to abide by international law and its own commitments. Last-\nminute changes the recent resolution included a reaffirmation of the \nsovereignty and ``territorial integrity of Sudan'' and the first \nparagraph of the resolution invites the Sudanese Government to consent \nto the deployment of a U.N. force, but such consent is not required by \ninternational law or the text of the resolution. Additionally, the U.N. \nResolution threatens sanctions for any individual or group that \nviolates human rights or the Darfur Peace Agreement.\n  At this critical juncture, the Government of Sudan must fulfill its \nobligation to relieve the suffering of its citizens by working with the \nUnited Nations to agree upon a robust, coordinated force to end the \nviolence in Darfur. It is essential that the international community \ndisplays steadfast solidarity in insisting upon the implementation of \nUnited Nations Resolution 1706 and provides the troops and resources \nnecessary to follow through on its commitment. The implications of \nallowing another genocide to take place in Africa could lead to a \ncomplete collapse in the U.N.'s authority and the deterioration of \ninternational law.\n  In conclusion, I am deeply troubled by recent developments regarding \nSudan. The international community has asserted its determination to \nbring\n\n[[Page S9297]]\n\nan end to the violence in Darfur. Now we need to act upon these \nintentions and pressure the Government of Sudan to cooperate in efforts \nto improve prospects for peace throughout Sudan and the greater east \nAfrica region.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/11/senate-section/article/S9297-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9297]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          FEDERAL FUNDING ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY ACT\n\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the Federal \nFunding Accountability and Transparency Act, which passed the Senate \nlast week.\n  This is an important bill that will bring badly needed transparency \nto Federal spending. The bill creates a user-friendly website to search \nall Government contracts, grants, earmarks, and loans, opening up \nFederal financial transactions to public scrutiny. By helping to lift \nthe veil of secrecy in Washington, this website will help make us all \nbetter legislators. It will help make reporters better journalists. And \nit will help make all Americans more informed voters and more active \ncitizens.\n  I am heartened to see that Government transparency can be a \nbipartisan issue. This bill has been cosponsored by more than 40 of our \ncolleagues and has the support of more than 100 outside groups from all \nparts of the political spectrum. It has been endorsed by dozens of \neditorial boards across the country from the Wall Street Journal, to \nthe Chicago Sun-Times and The Oklahoman. Most people I speak to in \nIllinois or here in Washington or anywhere else wonder why a public \nwebsite of all Federal spending does not already exist. To them, this \nis just common sense.\n  Whether you believe the Government ought to spend more money or spend \nless, you should certainly be able to agree that the Government ought \nto spend every penny efficiently and transparently. Transparency is the \nfirst step to holding Government accountable for its actions and is a \nprerequisite to oversight and financial control. We can't reduce waste, \nfraud, and abuse without knowing how, where, and why Federal money is \nflowing out the door. This bill will provide that transparency, and not \njust to Members of Congress. Anybody with access to the Internet will \nbe able to see how Federal funds are being spent. If Government \nspending can't withstand public scrutiny, then the money shouldn't be \nspent. The American people deserve no less.\n  I want to express my appreciation for the hard work that went into \ngetting S. 2590 passed. I would like to thank the majority leader and \nminority leader, as well as the chairman and ranking member of the \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, for their \nassistance in moving this important legislation forward.\n  I would also like to thank the organizations that helped create a \ngrassroots movement in support of Government transparency and in \nsupport of this bill. Without the hard work of OMB Watch, the Project \non Government Oversight, and Citizens Against Government Waste, to name \njust a few supporters, this bill would not have been considered and \npassed so quickly.\n  And most importantly, I would like to thank my colleague, Senator \nCoburn, and his outstanding staff for their diligence and dedication. \nSince Senator Coburn and I first met during freshman orientation, we \nhave developed a close personal bond that has translated into a close \nworking relationship to bring more transparency and accountability into \nthe way that Government spends taxpayer money. I have been impressed by \nthe commitment and tenacity with which he stands up for his principles \nand beliefs, and it is these qualities that enabled this bill to get \npassed.\n  The House of Representatives is expected to vote on this bill later \nthis week, and I am confident that our bipartisan and bicameral \ncollaboration will quickly become law. It is not often that two \nSenators from different parties are able to bridge the partisan divide \nin this town and get something accomplished. But the American people \ndemand greater transparency and accountability, and it is our honor and \nprivilege--indeed, it is our duty--to provide the tools to help make \nthat possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/11/senate-section/article/S9297-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9297]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO SORIN DUCARU\n\n  Mr.BROWNBACK. I commend the Romanian Ambassador to the United States \nfor his service as a diplomat, a civil leader, a transatlantic thinker, \nand a friend of the United States.\n  Sorin Ducaru has served as Romania's principal diplomatic spokesman \nfor the last 5 years. He played a key role in the Romanian Ministry of \nForeign Affairs as the first head of the Division for NATO and \nStrategic Issues and was deeply involved in events leading to Romania's \nmembership in NATO--ratified with the unanimous support of the U.S. \nSenate.\n  Once Romania joined NATO, Ambassador Ducaru was a part of the \nRomanian team that helped pave the way for the establishment of U.S. \nmilitary facilities in Romania. The agreement was signed in 2005, \nratified this past summer, and is currently in its implementation \nphase.\n  On this fifth anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in particular, it is \nimportant to recall our partners in the war on terrorism. In 2001, just \ndays after 9/11 terrorist attacks, Ambassador Ducaru helped facilitate \nRomanian-American political dialogue that resulted in Romania's offer \nto put its military and logistical facilities, air corridors, and \ntroops at the disposal of the United States in the war on terrorism. \nEven before Romania was a NATO member, it participated with troops and \nlogistical support in the war on terrorism. Now, Romania is the fifth \nlargest contributor of troops in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n  Ambassador Ducaru has been a strong supporter of Romania's \nparticipation in the process of democratic and economic reconstruction \nof Afghanistan and Iraq, pointing to the lessons learned of his own \ncountry's dramatic and sometimes painful transformations in the last 16 \nyears. He has been a constant advocate of cooperation between American \nbusinesses and the business potential of coalition countries.\n  His support for democracy in Afghanistan and Iraq is not surprising \nbecause Ambassador Ducaru is a long-time advocate of democratic values. \nHe is a member of the new generation of leaders that transformed \nRomania to an open free society following the revolution of 1989. He \nhas been at the forefront of a new generation of Central European \nleaders whose countries have evolved from nondemocratic and closed \nsocieties to countries that preserve freedom, security, and economic \nopportunity.\n  As he departs his current post to become the Romanian Ambassador to \nthe North Atlantic Treaty Organization, I express my gratitude for his \nefforts to build a strong and vibrant relationship between Romania and \nthe United States. I look forward to working with him to continue \nefforts to expand political, diplomatic, economic, and military \ncooperation and stability through NATO. Ambassador Ducaru is a true \nfriend of the United States, and I wish him well in his new capacity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/11/senate-section/article/S9297-3", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9297-S9301]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REDUCING FOREIGN ENERGY RELIANCE\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President. I rise today to request that my remarks, \ndelivered in the keynote address to the Richard G. Lugar-Purdue \nUniversity Summit on Energy Security, at Purdue University, West \nLafayette, IN, on August 29, 2006, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       I am honored to address this assembly, which will explore \n     an aggressive agenda to reduce our nation's dependence on \n     foreign energy sources. I appreciate the opening words of my \n     good friend, Governor Mitch Daniels. He and his \n     administration have given priority to energy issues in \n     Indiana. They are attempting to maximize the opportunities \n     that our state has to become a leader in a broad gamut of \n     energy technologies. I also want to thank our host, Purdue \n     University, and President Martin Jischke for promoting this \n     energy summit. President Jischke has provided brilliant \n     direction to this university. His advice on energy, \n     agriculture, education, and many other topics has been of \n     great benefit to me personally. I will deeply miss his \n     leadership at Purdue when he steps down as President next \n     June, but I look forward to a very productive year \n     immediately ahead and many mutual endeavors in years to come. \n     I am also delighted that Congressman Pete Visclosky, will \n     address the summit conference this noon. Pete has been a \n     great partner on numerous issues,\n\n[[Page S9298]]\n\n     ranging from local projects of special importance to \n     Hoosiers, to the global search for an AIDS vaccine.\n       It is exciting to be surrounded by so many talented \n     individuals who are committed to the objective of greater \n     energy independence for the United States. I believe that in \n     the future, the United States can be energy self sufficient \n     or nearly so. Over the long term, we have the resources and \n     the ingenuity to achieve this goal.\n       The crucial question is what happens between now and then. \n     Will we achieve this goal rapidly through a coherent and \n     resolute national policy that takes advantage of America's \n     natural assets to create new economic opportunities, a \n     cleaner environment, and improved national security? Or will \n     we achieve our objective only after many years of widespread \n     economic pain and national vulnerability caused by scarcity, \n     terrorist attacks, market shocks, and foreign manipulation of \n     our energy supplies?\n       We must move now to address our energy vulnerability \n     because sufficient investment cannot happen overnight, and it \n     will take years to build supporting infrastructure and to \n     change behavior. In other words, by the time a sustained \n     energy crisis fully motivates market forces, we are likely to \n     be well past the point where we can save ourselves from \n     extensive suffering. Our motivation will come too late and \n     the resulting investment will come too slowly to prevent the \n     severe economic and national security consequences of our oil \n     dependence. This is the very essence of a problem requiring \n     citizen, business, and governmental action.\n       I will describe our energy dilemma as a six-pronged threat \n     to national security. First, oil supplies are vulnerable to \n     natural disasters, wars, and terrorist attacks that can \n     disrupt the lifeblood of the international economy. Within \n     the last year, the international flow of oil has been \n     disrupted by hurricanes, unrest in Nigeria, and continued \n     sabotage in Iraq. In late February of this year, terrorists \n     penetrated the outer defenses of Saudi Arabia's largest oil \n     processing facility with car bombs before being repulsed. Al-\n     Qaeda and other terrorist organizations have openly declared \n     their intent to attack oil facilities to inflict pain on \n     Western economies.\n       Second, as large industrializing nations such as China and \n     India seek new energy supplies, oil and natural gas will \n     become more expensive. In the long run we will face the \n     prospect that the world's supply of oil may not be abundant \n     and accessible enough to support continued economic growth in \n     both the industrialized West and in large rapidly growing \n     economies. As we approach the point where the world's oil-\n     hungry economies are competing for insufficient supplies of \n     energy, oil will become an even stronger magnet for conflict.\n       Third, adversarial regimes from Venezuela, to Iran, to \n     Russia are using energy supplies as leverage against their \n     neighbors. We are used to thinking in terms of conventional \n     warfare between nations, but energy is becoming a weapon of \n     choice for those who possess it. Nations experiencing a \n     cutoff of energy supplies, or even the threat of a cutoff, \n     may become desperate, increasing the chances of armed \n     conflict, terrorism, and economic collapse.\n       Fourth, the revenues flowing to authoritarian regimes often \n     increase corruption in those countries and allow them to \n     insulate themselves from international pressure and the \n     democratic aspirations of their own peoples. We are \n     transferring hundreds of billions of dollars each year to \n     some of the least accountable regimes in the world. Some are \n     using this money to invest abroad in terrorism, instability, \n     or demagogic appeals to populism.\n       Fifth, the threat of climate change has been made worse by \n     inefficient and unclean use of non-renewable energy. In the \n     long run this could bring drought, famine, disease, and mass \n     migration, all of which could lead to conflict and \n     instability.\n       Sixth, much of the developing world is being hit hard by \n     rising energy costs, which often cancel the benefits of our \n     foreign assistance. Without a diversification of energy \n     supplies that emphasizes environmentally friendly energy \n     sources that are abundant in most developing countries, the \n     national incomes of energy poor nations will remain \n     depressed, with negative consequences for stability, \n     development, disease eradication, and terrorism.\n       Each of these six threats from energy dependence is \n     becoming more acute as time passes. Any of them could be a \n     source of catastrophe for the United States and the world.\n       The vulnerability of the United States rests on some basic \n     factors. With less than 5 percent of the world's population, \n     our nation consumes 25 percent of its oil. World demand for \n     oil and other forms of energy is rapidly increasing. Within \n     25 years, the world will need 50 percent more energy than it \n     does now. If oil prices average $60 a barrel through 2006--a \n     figure that we are currently well above--we will spend about \n     $320 billion on oil imports this year. This is roughly the \n     same amount that the United States has spent on the war and \n     reconstruction effort in Iraq during the first three years of \n     conflict.\n       These conditions might be negotiable in the short and \n     medium terms if oil resided with responsible, secure \n     producers who maximize production during periods of elevated \n     demand. But just the opposite is true. According to PFC \n     Energy, about 79 percent of the world's oil supply is \n     controlled by state-run oil companies. These governments \n     profoundly affect prices through politicized investment \n     and production decisions. The vast majority of these oil \n     assets are afflicted by at least one of three problems: \n     lack of investment, political manipulation, or the threat \n     of instability and terrorism.\n       As recently as four years ago, spare production capacity \n     exceeded world oil consumption by about ten percent. As world \n     demand for oil has rapidly increased in the last few years, \n     spare capacity has declined to less than two percent. Thus, \n     even minor disruptions of oil can drive up prices. Earlier \n     this month, a routine inspection found corrosion in a section \n     of BP's Prudhoe Bay oil pipeline that shut down 8 percent of \n     U.S. oil output, causing a $2 spike in oil prices. That the \n     oil market is this vulnerable to something as mundane as \n     corrosion in a pipeline is evidence of the precarious \n     conditions in which we live.\n       Our current dependence on imported oil has put the United \n     States in a position that no great power should tolerate. Our \n     economic health is subject to forces far beyond our control, \n     including the decisions of hostile countries. We maintain a \n     massive military presence overseas, partly to preserve our \n     oil lifeline. One conservative estimate puts U.S. oil-\n     dedicated military expenditures in the Middle East at $50 \n     billion per year. But there is no guarantee that even our \n     unrivaled military forces can prevent an energy disaster. We \n     have lost leverage on the international stage and are daily \n     exacerbating the problem by participating in an enormous \n     wealth transfer to authoritarian nations that happen to \n     possess the commodity that our economy can least do without.\n       Rising energy prices, news reports of hostile oil \n     producers, and the energy shocks experienced after the \n     Katrina and Rita hurricanes, have awakened Americans to our \n     energy vulnerability.\n       Almost six months ago, I delivered an address at the \n     Brookings Institution in which I described ``a shifting \n     balance of realism'' from those who believe in the \n     immutability of oil domination of our economy and a laissez \n     faire approach to energy policy to those who recognize that \n     our nation has no choice but to seek a major reorientation in \n     the way we get our energy. With oil at $72 a barrel and \n     multiple crises flaring in the Middle East, fewer pro-oil \n     commentators still assert that dependence on oil is simply a \n     choice of the marketplace and government can and should do \n     little to change it.\n       I believe that there is a growing consensus behind the new \n     energy realism. There are clear signs that policy makers and \n     a majority of the public recognize that our oil dependence is \n     dangerously unsustainable.\n       The media is filled with examples of enterprising \n     individuals who are making ethanol or biodiesel, erecting \n     windmills, installing solar panels, or otherwise establishing \n     personal control over their energy resources. A review of the \n     nation's five largest newspapers revealed that twice as many \n     energy-related stories appeared in July 2006 as appeared in \n     July 2003.\n       Gasoline prices are beginning to have some effect on the \n     automobile choices of American consumers. Sales of SUV's were \n     down fifteen percent in the first half of 2006 compared with \n     the same period in 2005. Sales of compact cars, by \n     comparison, rose eight percent. These statistics were \n     reinforced by a May 2006 Consumer Reports survey, which \n     found that 37 percent of Americans were considering \n     trading in their current cars for more fuel efficient \n     cars. Almost half of these consumers were considering the \n     purchase of a hybrid car or another alternative to \n     traditional gasoline powered cars.\n       Progress is also appearing in the investment world. The \n     entrepreneurial vanguard that brought us the internet and \n     transformed telecommunications is turning its attention to \n     alternative energy. According to data compiled by VentureOne, \n     venture capital targeted at alternative energy projects more \n     than tripled to $315 million in the first half of 2006 \n     compared to the first half of 2005. Alternative energy \n     investment is no longer just a niche area for environmental \n     idealists and companies trying to improve their public image.\n       As a political issue, energy has been elevated to a status \n     that is roughly equivalent to health care or education. A \n     check of all one hundred Senators' websites in early August \n     found that at least 85 of them had either issued a press \n     release on energy this summer or had an energy section \n     prominently displayed on their homepage. No politician on the \n     national scene can afford to ignore energy.\n       Unfortunately, although many Americans are embracing the \n     idea of changing our energy destiny, they have not committed \n     themselves to the action steps required to achieve an \n     alternative future. This is an important distinction, because \n     although national acceptance that there is a problem is a \n     necessary condition for solving the problem, it does not \n     guarantee that the problem will be solved.\n       In fact, advancements in American energy security have been \n     painfully slow during 2006, and political leadership has been \n     defensive, rather than pro-active. One can point with \n     appreciation to a few positive trends, as I have just done, \n     but these are small steps forward in the context of our \n     larger vulnerability. If our economy is crippled by an oil \n     embargo, if terrorists succeed in disrupting our oil \n     lifeline, or if we slide into a war because oil wealth has \n     emboldened anti-American regimes, it will not matter that \n     before disaster struck, the American public and its\n\n[[Page S9299]]\n\n     leaders gained a new sense of realism about our \n     vulnerability. It will not matter that we were producing \n     marginally more ethanol than before or that consumers are \n     more willing to consider hybrids and other alternative \n     vehicles.\n       Not all indices and measures of energy progress are even \n     moving in the right direction. The American people are \n     angered by $3.00 gasoline, but they are still buying it in \n     record quantities. In a recent Business Week article, writer \n     Peter Coy points out that gasoline consumption during the \n     2006 July 4th holiday was up 2 percent from a year earlier \n     and consumers bought ten percent more gasoline in the first \n     half of 2006 than they did in the first half of 2000, even \n     though the price of gasoline was 75 percent higher.\n       Neither American oil companies, nor American car companies \n     have shown an inclination to dramatically transform their \n     businesses in ways that will achieve the degree of change we \n     need to address a national security emergency. In fact, a \n     number of the major oil companies have written to me to \n     explain why they are not enthusiastic about installing pumps \n     that can accommodate E85--a blend of gasoline and up to 85 \n     percent ethanol. Some are distinctly hostile to any such \n     idea.\n       General Motors launched a new ``Live Green, Go Yellow'' ad \n     campaign to promote the purchase of flexible fuel vehicles. \n     But its strategy for overall corporate recovery appears to \n     depend on the sale of pickup trucks. Earlier this month, \n     General Motors CEO Richard Wagoner called a new redesigned \n     line of pickup trucks ``the most important part of our North \n     American turnaround plan.'' According to the New York Times, \n     to counter GM's new line, Ford Motors plans to cut the price \n     of its 2007 F-Series pickups, add two more body styles, and \n     increase towing capacity. Moreover, earlier in the summer, GM \n     attempted to tap into consumer worries about gasoline costs \n     by offering to subsidize gasoline for purchasers of certain \n     gas guzzlers in Florida and California. Under the deal, GM \n     would cap the price of gasoline at $1.99 per gallon for one \n     year for buyers of Hummers, Yukons, Tahoes, and other large \n     vehicles.\n       Within State governments, dropping speed limits or raising \n     gas taxes are non-starters almost everywhere. In fact, speed \n     limits are rising in some states. Recently, Texas raised \n     speed limits on some sections of rural interstate highways to \n     80 miles per hour, effectively ensuring that many motorists \n     will be traveling closer to 90 miles per hour on those \n     stretches and using more gasoline per mile.\n       Most importantly, the Federal Government is not treating \n     energy vulnerability as a crisis, despite an increase in \n     energy related proposals. Consider that the only major energy \n     legislation taken up by Congress so far this year was \n     legislation to encourage offshore oil and gas production in \n     the Gulf of Mexico. I supported passage of the bill, but it \n     was offered in a format that did not allow for amendments, \n     and no bill has emerged from a House-Senate conference. If \n     the bill passes, we would be addressing only a small corner \n     of the energy picture. Issues such as energy efficiency, \n     renewable fuels, and alternative energy technology had no \n     chance to be discussed.\n       Even when the Congress and the President establish programs \n     that would produce meaningful results, bureaucratic inertia \n     and turf-consciousness within the Federal agencies have added \n     delays. Groundbreaking for the first commercial-scale \n     cellulosic ethanol plant has been on hold for a year while \n     investors wait for the Federal government to establish the \n     regulations and application procedure for a loan guarantee \n     program that was passed last summer. The program was meant to \n     jump start the commercialization of cellulosic ethanol--a key \n     goal of President Bush and Congress. But despite the urgency \n     of this mission, the Energy Department's glacial \n     implementation of the program has frustrated potential \n     investors and those of us who are urging the transition to \n     gasoline alternatives. In fairness, Secretary Bodman \n     announced in early August that the Energy Department will \n     accept proposals this fall for cellulosic plant pilot \n     projects, even before regulations are complete. The \n     Department estimates that construction of the first plants \n     could begin early next year.\n       We could all take our time if this were merely a matter of \n     accomplishing an industrial conversion to more cost effective \n     technologies. Unfortunately, in the absence of far-reaching \n     changes in energy policy, we are risking multiple disasters \n     for our country.\n       The energy debate is afflicted with what writer Jonathan \n     Rauch has called ``Demosclerosis''--the phenomenon of \n     competing interest groups protecting their perceived \n     interests so effectively that policy can achieve only least \n     common denominator outcomes that do not solve the problem \n     threatening the whole nation. Rauch used the concept of \n     demosclerosis to describe the gridlock afflicting efforts to \n     cut the federal budget and restructure entitlement programs. \n     But it is also applicable to the energy debate. The competing \n     interests of oil companies, car companies, environmentalists, \n     truckers, farmers, consumers, and governmental agencies \n     cancel out initiatives or compromises that serve the broader \n     public interest.\n       Even in California, where voters tend to be environmentally \n     sensitive and where pollution provides a strong extra impetus \n     to cut gasoline use, entrenched business interests have \n     succeeded in discouraging alternative fuels and \n     transportation technologies. Since 1979, California lawmakers \n     have tried a variety of approaches, only to be frustrated by \n     the oil and auto industries that resisted change. A proposal \n     there to cut oil use 15 percent by 2020 is supported by \n     Governor Schwarzenegger, but opposed by the major oil \n     companies, and has not made it through the legislature. \n     California consumes more gasoline than any other state. Yet \n     the number of E85 stations open to the public, after all the \n     conflicting cross-currents, is exactly one.\n       Overlaying these elements of gridlock are memories of \n     President Jimmy Carter's unpopular energy program from the \n     1970s. His dour calls for sacrifice remain a cautionary \n     example for many office holders, editorial writers, and \n     political strategists. Conventional political wisdom holds \n     that the American public will punish anyone who forces \n     significant energy sacrifices on them. This is a major \n     oversimplification, but it is true that Americans are not \n     eager to pay higher prices for energy, wait in gas lines, or \n     see their driving or horsepower curtailed. A recent \n     Bloomberg/Los Angeles Times poll asked about 1,500 people \n     which of five options were ``the best way to reduce U.S. \n     reliance on foreign oil.'' Two percent chose increasing the \n     gas tax. Building new nuclear plants or enforcing stricter \n     mileage standards fared little better at 6 and 8 percent \n     respectively. Respondents gravitated toward general trends \n     that were unlikely to affect them personally, with 52 percent \n     endorsing increased government investments in alternative \n     energy sources and 20 percent choosing to relax environmental \n     standards for oil and gas drilling.\n       Breaking through a political logjam often requires a crisis \n     that focuses the nation in a way that achieves a consensus. \n     But consider that the combination of September 11, 2001, the \n     war in Iraq, the conflict on the Israeli-Lebanese border, the \n     nuclear standoffs with Iran and North Korea, the Katrina and \n     Rita hurricanes, sustained $3.00 per gallon gasoline, and \n     several other severe problems have not created a consensus on \n     energy policy. This leads one to the sobering conclusion that \n     a disaster capable of sufficiently energizing public opinion \n     and our political structures will have to be something worse \n     than the collective maladies I just mentioned--perhaps \n     extreme enough to push the price of oil to triple digits and \n     set in motion a worldwide economic downturn. None of us want \n     to experience this or any of the nightmare scenarios that \n     await us. It is time to summon the political will to overcome \n     the energy stalemate.\n       In most areas of national policy we are concerned far more \n     with trends than with a discernable national goal. For \n     example, we watch the effects of President Bush's ``No Child \n     Left Behind Act'' and debate whether more American school \n     children are reading at grade level than before. Despite the \n     name of that bill, we realize that not every school or every \n     child will succeed. We measure success or failure in trends \n     and those trends have meaning because they can be translated \n     into progress for real individuals. The same is true for most \n     aspects of health care policy, environmental protection, job \n     creation, highway construction, and numerous other policy \n     areas. Even when goals aren't met completely, we are rarely \n     disappointed if we achieve measurable improvements.\n       Our energy dilemma is different. Although every gallon of \n     ethanol, every E-85 pump, every flex fuel vehicle that comes \n     on line moves us closer to safety, they do not necessarily \n     make us safer right now. Marginally reducing our reliance on \n     imported oil over the course of the next few decades will be \n     welcome, but we will still be vulnerable to disaster at any \n     time, and our national security and economic policy options \n     will be constrained accordingly.\n       Our energy vulnerability is analogous to rowing a boat to \n     shore in rough seas. Each stroke moves us closer to safety, \n     but until we reach the shore, we can be capsized. We have to \n     measure progress not against where we have been, but against \n     the distance to our goals. Achieving a positive trend line is \n     almost inevitable as long as energy costs remain high, \n     because these costs will lead to some improvements in \n     investment and conservation. We need to have the discipline \n     to understand that a modestly positive trend line is not \n     enough. With the storm bearing down on them, the occupants of \n     a threatened boat do not put up their oars and relax because \n     the current has caused them to drift a little closer to \n     shore.\n       To bolster public motivation and to connect our efforts to \n     rational outcomes, we must work much harder to establish \n     meaningful goals. Americans need to know exactly what the \n     plan is and how we will achieve it. We not only must \n     understand how to bring alternatives to the market, we must \n     establish what degree of change would improve our national \n     security situation, then tailor national policy to achieve \n     that goal.\n       Although the energy debate is multifaceted, the heart of \n     our geostrategic problem is reliance on imported oil in a \n     market that is dominated by volatile and hostile governments. \n     This is where we must devote our national effort, because it \n     is our most intense short term vulnerability. It also could \n     bring the most collateral benefits, including reinvigorating \n     the American automobile and agricultural industries and \n     helping to reduce carbon emissions. This is not to minimize \n     the challenges facing our electricity grid or other energy \n     problems, but as we marshal our political capital for a \n     difficult task, this should be our first focus.\n\n[[Page S9300]]\n\n       To this end, the United States should adopt a national \n     program that would make virtually every new car sold in \n     America a flexible fuel vehicle. We should ensure that at \n     least one quarter of filling stations in America have E85 \n     pumps. We should expand ethanol production to 100 billion \n     gallons a year by 2025, a figure that could be achieved by \n     doubling output every five years. We should also create an \n     approximate $45 per barrel price floor on oil through a \n     variable ethanol tax credit to ensure that investments keep \n     flowing to alternatives. And we should enact stricter vehicle \n     mileage standards to point automobile innovation \n     toward conservation. The plan I am proposing today would \n     achieve the replacement of 6.5 million barrels of oil per \n     day by volume--the rough equivalent of one third of the \n     oil used in America and one half of our current oil \n     imports.\n       I am aware that these are ambitious goals, and that \n     achieving them will take political breakthroughs and \n     intensive government oversight. But if we have the political \n     will, America can end its oil addiction through technology, \n     the new economics of energy, and targeted government \n     incentives and regulations to focus market forces on the \n     problem.\n       As former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told the \n     Senate Foreign Relations Committee earlier this year, almost \n     one out of every seven barrels of oil produced in the world \n     is consumed on American highways. To break oil's monopoly on \n     American roads, some experts favor a giant leap in technology \n     to hydrogen. But that will require new engines, new \n     distribution systems, new production technologies, and is \n     decades away from commercialization. Instead, we can start to \n     break petroleum's grip right now. The key is making ethanol \n     as important as gasoline in our transportation fuel mix.\n       To start with, every new car can be easily fitted with \n     proven technology that enables it to burn E85. Millions of \n     these cars are on the road today, and the factory cost of \n     making each vehicle capable of burning E85 is probably less \n     than $150. Because these flex-fuel cars can run on either \n     gasoline or E85, or any combination, the driver can fill up \n     with E85 when it is available, and with regular gasoline when \n     it is not. So the first step should be to require that all \n     new cars sold in America be flex-fuel vehicles.\n       We applaud the efforts of American automakers to increase \n     their flexible fuel offerings. On June 28, Daimler-Chrysler, \n     Ford, and General Motors issued a statement announcing that \n     they will double their production of flexible fuel vehicles \n     by 2010. This pledge is significant within the context of the \n     auto company's business objectives, but it is inadequate in \n     the context of pursuing the national security benefits of \n     replacing a large share of gasoline with ethanol. The Federal \n     government should work with both foreign and domestic car \n     companies on a plan to rapidly achieve the goal of equipping \n     all new vehicles sold in America with flex-fuel technology. \n     The Federal government should be willing to offer incentives \n     to help make a voluntary plan work. But if car manufacturers \n     do not respond with a sufficient plan in a short time period, \n     Congress should mandate that all new autos sold in the United \n     States have flex-fuel capability.\n       I do not suggest this lightly. But my observations of the \n     post-Katrina response by car companies, oil companies, and \n     consumers is that in the short run, the evolution of market \n     forces won't be capable of producing the progress that we \n     need to achieve our national security goals, particularly \n     since the car fleet turns over slowly.\n       Next, we need to make E85 more widely available. Major oil \n     companies have resisted installing E85 pumps. Indeed, most of \n     the 897 E85 fuel stations in the country are independently-\n     owned. As the profits of oil companies have increased with \n     the price of oil, members of Congress have discussed \n     increasing taxes on oil companies or requiring that a certain \n     percentage of profits be devoted to research, exploration, or \n     alternative energy sources.\n       Some of these ideas may have merit. I would suggest, \n     however, that our first requirement of oil companies should \n     be to use some of their recent profits to install E85 pumps \n     in at least 25 percent of the nation's fuel stations within \n     ten years. Unfortunately, this may also require an outright \n     mandate. The majors have, thus far, shown little willingness \n     to take this step.\n       The oil companies have argued that installing these pumps \n     is too expensive and should wait until sufficient supplies of \n     ethanol and flex-fuel vehicles are available. It does cost \n     money to turn a gas pump into an E85 pump, primarily to \n     replace the underground storage tank. But the cost is \n     generally far less than the oil companies have portrayed. A \n     recent Wall Street Journal article cited Chevron as \n     estimating that installing an E85 pump costs $200,000. In \n     fact, last year I helped inaugurate an E85 outlet in Terre \n     Haute, and the owner said it cost her less than five thousand \n     dollars to retrofit her station. Moreover, according to oil \n     industry sources, installing a new E85 pump costs only about \n     $5,000 more than installing a new gasoline pump. This \n     suggests that stations on the drawing board would be low-cost \n     candidates for E85 pumps. Conversion of some pumps will be \n     much more expensive, and there are numerous price variables \n     to consider. But by making use of retrofits and by devoting \n     one pump to E85 at newly constructed fuel stations, the \n     average conversion cost nationwide would be a fraction of \n     what oil companies have implied.\n       In addition, gasoline companies can take advantage of an \n     existing tax credit for the installation of renewable fuel \n     pumps. I would support increasing this tax credit if a \n     mandate were enacted. Gasoline companies also would be able \n     to hold costs down by selecting the least expensive locations \n     for adding E85 pumps, as long as they met geographic \n     distribution requirements.\n       If the six largest gasoline companies installed E85 pumps \n     in half of their stations, we would get to the 25 percent \n     fuel station goal. For the sake of argument, if we estimated \n     that the average marginal cost of opening an E85 pump after \n     tax credits was $15,000, then establishing the pumps at one \n     quarter of the nation's 170,000 fuel stations would cost \n     approximately $637 million over ten years. That is just one \n     percent of the combined $64 billion profit made during 2005 \n     alone by the three largest American oil companies--Exxon-\n     Mobil, Chevron, and Conoco-Phillips. Even if the average cost \n     is somewhat more than $15,000, these figures illustrate that \n     the cost of a nationwide E85 pump conversion for the major \n     oil companies would be far from prohibitive.\n       My intent here is not to punish the oil companies. As a \n     Senator who has favored new drilling and other initiatives \n     designed to help the oil companies produce more domestic oil, \n     I am suggesting that they need to alter their thinking. In \n     the best circumstances, they would embrace ethanol and work \n     hard to diversify their investments and operations--partly \n     for the good will they would receive from Congress and the \n     public--but also to prepare for the coming decades of greater \n     American prosperity and security.\n       If the mandate can be effectively linked to the increasing \n     availability of ethanol, so much the better. But to achieve \n     our larger goal, we must be prepared to tolerate a certain \n     level of disconnect between cars, pumps, and ethanol in the \n     early stages of this effort. Some pumps may be underutilized \n     at first, but this cannot be an excuse not to move forward.\n       Incidentally, virtually every gas-powered vehicle in \n     America today can run on gasoline blended with 10 percent \n     ethanol, or E10. By requiring that all gasoline be E10 as \n     ethanol supplies become available, we could accommodate \n     significantly more ethanol production even before most flex-\n     fuel vehicles and E85 pumps are in place. Our neighbors in \n     Illinois have passed such legislation, and I have urged my \n     friends in Indianapolis to follow suit.\n       Now how do we produce enough ethanol to supply these \n     stations and fuel these cars? The good news is we can let the \n     market do a lot of the work. When oil is above $70 a barrel, \n     making ethanol from corn or sugar, even before subsidies, is \n     less costly than producing gasoline. That is true even if oil \n     drops substantially from today's level.\n       But the long term advancement of ethanol as a national \n     transportation fuel requires a focused effort to perfect and \n     commercialize cellulosic technology, which will enable us to \n     make ethanol from switch grass, agricultural waste and other \n     inexpensive biomass. The addition of cellulosic ethanol has \n     the potential to substantially reduce the overall production \n     cost of ethanol, while greatly expanding the volume produced. \n     Although scientists and technicians are confident of the \n     possibilities for cellulosic ethanol, efforts at \n     commercialization have lagged behind basic research. The time \n     is long past due for the Federal government to step in and \n     prime the pump for commercial production through an \n     aggressive loan program. The experience gained by the first \n     production plants will provide the knowledge we need to \n     rapidly expand the cellulosic industry.\n       Studies have shown that we will have enough land for energy \n     crops, given the expected increases in yields and \n     improvements in processing efficiency. If we could reach a \n     target of 100 billion gallons of ethanol a year--a 13-fold \n     increase over current capacity in operation or under \n     construction--that would be equivalent to 71 percent of \n     current gasoline consumption by volume. The two are not \n     directly comparable because ethanol has lower energy content \n     than gasoline, but over time, I expect automakers will \n     improve the efficiency of their engines for E85 fuel.\n       Although many investors are currently lining up to jump \n     into the ethanol business, many are still hesitating to take \n     the plunge. They fear that foreign oil producers might, as \n     they have before, manipulate the oil market to temporarily \n     cut the price and drive ethanol producers out of business. \n     Therefore, another step we should take is to ensure market \n     certainty for investors by setting a price floor for crude \n     oil at about $45 a barrel through a variable ethanol tax \n     credit that would rise as the price of oil dropped. I am \n     developing legislation to achieve this goal and have \n     benefited from the contributions of Dr. Wallace Tyner of \n     Purdue University, who will appear in the afternoon panel.\n       Finally, it will be far easier to alter the mix of fuel \n     supplies if we can slow or stop the growth in overall fuel \n     demand. It has been more than twenty years since there was a \n     change in the Corporate Average Fuel Efficiency standards for \n     cars. Over that time, American gas mileage has largely \n     stagnated. In 1987, the average light duty vehicle got 22.1 \n     miles per gallon, according to the EPA. Nineteen years later, \n     in 2006, the figure has fallen to 21 miles per gallon. Yet \n     during that time, automobile technology has greatly advanced, \n     only in other directions. For instance, today a family car \n     like the Toyota Camry has faster acceleration than a \n     muscle car of the 1970s.\n\n[[Page S9301]]\n\n       We need to channel the technical prowess of America's auto \n     industry in the direction of greater fuel efficiency so that \n     we can grow our economy without growing our fuel consumption. \n     Therefore, Congress should enact modern mileage standards \n     that set a target of steadily improving fuel economy every \n     year. It should also continue to encourage research, \n     development, and deployment of hybrids, plug-in technology, \n     ultra-light auto materials, biodiesel, and coal-based \n     transportation fuels, among other promising technologies.\n       This package of proposals would dramatically improve \n     America's security posture. It would not dismantle the \n     automobile culture that Americans cherish, nor would it \n     create a vast bureaucracy with a bottomless appetite for \n     taxpayer dollars. In fact, if it is accompanied by strong \n     leadership and thoughtful explanation, I am confident that \n     Americans will recognize that this is the way that we will \n     preserve our cars and our economy over the long run. It would \n     provide more jobs for Americans instead of sending a deluge \n     of money to hostile countries, support our farmers instead of \n     foreign terrorists, and promote green fuels over fossil \n     fuels.\n       It should not surprise you to learn that I have proposed or \n     co-sponsored legislation on these ideas. But this is just a \n     start. None of these bills has passed, or even been put to a \n     vote in the Senate. For instance, the Fuel Economy Reform \n     Act, which I co-sponsored with my friend Sen. Barack Obama \n     and other Democrats and Republicans, seeks a four percent \n     annual increase in fuel economy. Last month, Sen. Obama tried \n     to amend the offshore oil drilling bill with our legislation, \n     but Senate procedures prevented him from doing so. While we \n     are asking for greater statesmanship from our automobile and \n     oil companies, we must demand the same from our Federal \n     legislators and administrators.\n       Far in the future, historians may point to the energy \n     policy of the last several decades as the major national \n     security failing of the American government in this era. In \n     the absence of decisive policy changes, historians will \n     rightly ask how the wealthiest and most powerful nation on \n     earth with abundant land, a magnificent industrial \n     infrastructure, and the world's best universities and \n     research institutions simply would not reorient itself over \n     the course of decades despite repeated warning signs. Our \n     failure to act will be all the more unconscionable given that \n     success would bring not only relief from the geopolitical \n     threats of energy-rich regimes, but also restorative economic \n     benefits to our farmers, rural areas, automobile \n     manufacturers, high technology industries, and many others.\n       We must be very clear that this is a political problem. We \n     now have the financial resources, the industrial might, and \n     the technological prowess to shift our economy away from oil \n     dependence. What we are lacking is coordination and political \n     will. We have made choices, as a society, which have given \n     oil a near monopoly on American transportation. Now we must \n     make a different choice in the interest of American national \n     security and our economic future. As the vanguard of \n     concerned and informed experts in this field, I call upon \n     each of you to apply your talents and energies to solving \n     this fundamental problem threatening the well-being of our \n     nation. I look forward to working with you as we achieve this \n     goal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/11/senate-section/article/S9301-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9301]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     REMEMBERING MADONNA ARCHAMBEAU\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life of \nMadonna Archambeau. Madonna was a member of the Ihanktonwan Dakota \nNation who passed away just over a week ago.\n  Mrs. Archambeau was born in 1934 in Ravinia, SD just a few miles off \nthe Missouri River near the Nebraska border. Mrs. Archambeau was then \neducated at St. Paul's Indian Mission in nearby Marty, SD. From there, \nshe began her service to her community which culminated in her election \nas the first woman to chair the Yankton Sioux Tribe.\n  Mrs. Archambeau began her career at the post office in Greenwood, SD, \nthen moved to the Indian Health Service where she served for 31 years. \nAlthough she didn't end her career there; after her retirement from IHS \nshe ran for chairperson of the Yankton Sioux Tribe and eventually \ntribal members elected her as the first woman to serve in that \nposition.\n  This exceptionally strong woman was an especially strong advocate for \nthe health and wellness of the Yankton Sioux Tribe and some of her \ngreatest contributions to the tribe were in the health care arena. A \ntireless advocate of the health needs of her people, Mrs. Archambeau \nfought for adequate health care by working to ensure that emergency \nservices remained at the Wagner Service Unit of the IHS. She was also a \nmajor influence in the establishment of a dialysis center for members \nof the Yankton Sioux Tribe.\n  It was my pleasure to have worked with her during her term and I \nwould like to offer my condolences to the family, friends, and fellow \nadvocates whom Madonna touched with her efforts on behalf of her \npeople. They have much to be proud of, and it is my hope that their \nmemories will be rich with the great many accomplishments she achieved \nduring her career. Her memory will serve as a beacon to young Native \nwomen in the Yankton Sioux tribe and throughout Indian Country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/11/senate-section/article/S9301-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9301]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following bills were read the second time, and placed on the \ncalendar:\n\n       H.R. 503.

A resolution adopted by the General Assembly of \n     the State of New Jersey relative to outsourcing port \n     operations to a company controlled by a foreign government; \n     to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n                      Assembly Resolution No. 138\n\n       Whereas, Security officials of the administration of \n     President George W. Bush, both United States Senators from \n     the State of New Jersey, the Governor of the State of New \n     Jersey and members of this House have serious concerns that \n     terrorists could infiltrate ports through Dubai Ports World, \n     a company controlled by the United Arab Emirates; and\n       Whereas, Intelligence and security officials believe that \n     ports are vulnerable to the entry of terrorists or illicit \n     weapons because of the large number of containers that enter \n     the United States through these port facilities; and\n       Whereas, The ports of New York, Newark, Philadelphia, \n     Baltimore, Miami and New Orleans are major points of entry \n     into the United States; and\n       Whereas, The United Arab Emirates has a mixed record in \n     combating terrorism and terrorist organizations; and\n       Whereas, The United Arab Emirates was one of only three \n     countries to recognize the Taliban regime in Afghanistan; and\n       Whereas, The 45-day review of Dubai Ports World security \n     details must be carried out in a rigorous and independent \n     manner with Congress given final authority over the deal; and\n       Whereas, The Bush administration has been unable to provide \n     sufficient evidence that security procedures vital to the \n     United States will not be compromised by officials from a \n     foreign company that is controlled by a foreign government; \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the General Assembly of the State of New \n     Jersey:\n       1. It is the sense of the General Assembly of the State of \n     New Jersey that President Bush should reconsider his \n     decision, and he is advised to reverse his decision, to \n     permit the sale of certain United States port operations to \n     Dubai Ports World because this foreign company is controlled \n     by a government with a mixed record in fighting terrorism.\n       2. It is the sense of the General Assembly of the State of \n     New Jersey that the federal government should conduct a \n     thorough review of this pending sale, pursuant to a 45-day \n     investigation period required by federal law.\n       3. Duly authenticated copies of this resolution, signed by \n     the Speaker of the General Assembly and attested by the Clerk \n     thereof, shall be transmitted to the President and Vice \n     President of the United States, the Majority and Minority \n     Leader of the United States Senate, the Speaker and Minority \n     Leader of the United States House of Representatives, and \n     every member of Congress elected from this State.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-422. A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Hawaii relative to the \n     adoption of changes to the Medicare Part D Program; to the \n     Committee on Finance.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 80\n\n       Whereas, over 40 million Americans, including approximately \n     186,000 Hawaii residents, receive health coverage through \n     Medicare and are currently eligible to purchase prescription \n     drug coverage through the Medicare Part D Program, which \n     began on January 1, 2006; and\n       Whereas, over 6.4 million Americans, including 26,000 \n     Hawaii residents, are eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid \n     and are referred to as ``dual eligibles''; and\n       Whereas, the dual eligible group, 60 percent of whom live \n     below the poverty line, has more individuals who rely on \n     healthcare than other Medicare beneficiaries, with more than \n     50 percent requiring assistance with activities of daily \n     living or suffering from multiple chronic conditions, such as \n     Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, pulmonary disease, or stroke; \n     and\n       Whereas, the number of elderly residents in the state is \n     expected to rise rapidly over the next two decades with one \n     in four residents over the age of 60; and\n       Whereas, Medicare-eligible individuals enrolling in the \n     Medicare Part D Program after May 15, 2006, face a cumulative \n     one percent late-enrollment penalty for each month between \n     the date they were eligible and the date they enrolled; and\n       Whereas, the enrollment penalty for Medicare Part B is ten \n     percent per year on the standard premium amount, which is \n     more predictable and less severe than the enrollment penalty \n     for Medicare Part D; and\n       Whereas, Medicare beneficiaries must now navigate a new, \n     complex system of multiple health plans to purchase coverage \n     and receive prescription drug benefits; and\n       Whereas, each prescription drug plan has a different \n     formulary, different co-payments, and varied cost-sharing \n     that Medicare beneficiaries must understand to determine \n     which plan has a formulary that not only includes most, or \n     all, of the beneficiaries' drugs, but also offers the best \n     value; and\n       Whereas, beneficiaries face a great deal of uncertainty as \n     each plan is allowed to modify its formulary, including \n     dropping coverage of medications, on a monthly basis, while \n     most Medicare beneficiaries may only change plans once a year \n     during the open enrollment period; and\n       Whereas, a beneficiary who needs a drug that is suddenly \n     dropped by the chosen plan must change to another drug or pay \n     out-of-pocket for the drug; and\n       Whereas, drugs not listed on the formulary that are \n     purchased out-of-pocket by a beneficiary or paid for with a \n     discount card or through a state pharmacy program do not \n     count toward he beneficiaries' cost-sharing under the \n     Medicare Part D plan; and\n       Whereas, plans are not required to disclose complete \n     information about the actual price of the drugs on their \n     formularies nor the cost of these drugs as negotiated by the \n     plan which drug manufacturers, resulting in the opportunity \n     for plans to inflate prices charged to Medicare beneficiaries \n     who will then have a higher total cost-sharing amount; and\n       Whereas, many states will have additional costs associated \n     with the ``clawback'' provision of the Medicare law, which \n     requires states to reimburse the federal government for the \n     costs of dual eligibles based on a formula that may not \n     accurately reflect actual costs and numbers of these \n     enrollees; and\n       Whereas, States will also incur significant costs if they \n     participate in educational and other efforts necessary to \n     ensure that dual eligibles and other Medicare enrollees do \n     not have a gap in coverage and have adequate information with \n     which to make informed choices between plan options; and\n       Whereas, the State initiated a fail-safe program that \n     covered dual eligibles' prescriptions if their claims were \n     not processed through the drug plans offered by the new \n     Medicare Part D Program, and paid 480 claims in a four-day \n     period from January l, 2006 to January 4, 2006, to ensure \n     that patients received their medications; and\n       Whereas, the Medicare law explicitly prohibits negotiations \n     over the price paid by the federal government for \n     prescription drugs; and\n       Whereas, these same medications currently provided to dual \n     eligibles under Medicaid are subject to price negotiation by \n     the federal government, and the costs of these medications, \n     which will be reimbursed by the states to the federal \n     government, are likely to increase in the absence of price \n     negotiation; and\n       Whereas, according to the Congressional Budget Office, the \n     new Medicare Part D Program is expected to increase spending \n     by $47 billion in 2006, the first year of implementation, and \n     reach $174 billion per year in 2015, when it will make up 23 \n     percent of the $766 billion in total Medicare spending; now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-\n     third Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of \n     2006, the Senate concurring, That the President and Congress \n     of the United States are requested to adopt the following \n     changes to the Medicare Part D Program:\n       (1) Eliminate the penalty for all Medicare-eligible \n     individuals enrolling after May 15, 2006;\n       (2) Permit, once a year, prescription drug plans to drop \n     coverage of drugs on their formularies only after advance \n     notice to coincide with the annual open enrollment period, \n     except that drugs that have been determined to be dangerous \n     or have been removed from the market may be dropped from \n     formularies as deemed necessary for safety;\n       (3) Standardize the formulary design so that each plan has \n     the same number of tiers and requirements for coverage;\n       (4) Modify the requirements for what can be counted toward \n     the Medicare beneficiaries' ``true out-of-pocket cost,'' or \n     ``TROOP,'' to include all prescription drugs purchased on \n     behalf of the beneficiary regardless of where the drugs are \n     purchased, whether purchased through a state pharmacy program \n     or with a discount card, or whether the drug is on the \n     formulary of the enrollee's plan;\n       (5) Ensure transparency so that states know the cost \n     negotiated by the prescription drug plan to ensure that all \n     negotiated rebates are passed on to the beneficiaries; and\n\n[[Page S9306]]\n\n       (6) Institute price negotiations for the purchase of \n     prescription drugs for the Medicare program, similar to the \n     provisions already in place under Medicaid and the Veterans \n     Administration; and be it further\n       Resolved, That certified copies of this Concurrent \n     Resolution be transmitted to the President of the United \n     States, the Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives, the President of the United States Senate, \n     and the members of Hawaii's Congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-423. A resolution adopted by the General Assembly of \n     the State of New Jersey relative to Lyme and tick-borne \n     disease prevention education; to the Committee on Health, \n     Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                       Assembly Resolution No. 55\n\n       Whereas, Lyme disease is a common but frequently \n     misunderstood illness that, if not caught early and treated \n     properly, can cause serious health problems; and\n       Whereas, Lyme disease is a bacterial infection that is \n     transmitted by a tick bite, and early signs of infection may \n     include a rash and flulike symptoms such as fever, muscle \n     aches, headaches and fatigue; and\n       Whereas, although Lyme disease can be treated with \n     antibiotics if caught early, the disease often goes \n     undetected because it mimics other illnesses or may be \n     misdiagnosed and, if untreated, can lead to severe heart, \n     neurological, eye and joint problems because the bacteria can \n     affect many different organs and organ systems; and\n       Whereas, although Lyme, disease accounts for 90 percent of \n     all vectorborne infections in the United States, the ticks \n     that spread the disease also spread other diseases, such as \n     ehrlichiosis, babesiosis and other strains of Borrelia; and\n       Whereas, studies indicate that only 10 percent of the \n     number of tick-borne disease cases reported meet the criteria \n     established by the Federal Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention; and\n       Whereas, the persistence of symptomatology in many patients \n     without reliable testing makes treatment of patients more \n     difficult; and\n       Whereas, New Jersey ranks third among the 50 states in the \n     number of reported Lyme disease cases; and\n       Whereas, the ``Lyme and Tick-borne Disease Prevention, \n     Education, and Research Act of 2005'' has been introduced in \n     the 109th Congress as H.R. 3427 and S. 1479; and\n       Whereas, the ``Lyme and Tick-borne Disease Prevention, \n     Education, and Research Act of 2005'' would advance the \n     treatment of, and cure for, Lyme and other tick-borne \n     diseases by expanding federal efforts concerning prevention, \n     education, treatment and research activities related to Lyme \n     and other tick-borne diseases, providing authorization for \n     the appropriation of $20 million for each of the federal \n     fiscal years 2006 through 2010 for these activities and \n     requiring the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \n     annually report to Congress on these activities and make \n     recommendations for further research and education, and \n     establishing a Tick-borne Diseases Advisory Committee within \n     the Office of the Secretary of Health and Human Services; \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the General Assembly of the State of New \n     Jersey:\n       1. This House respectfully memorializes the United States \n     Congress and the President of the United States to enact the \n     ``Lyme and Tick-borne Disease Prevention, Education, and \n     Research Act of 2005,'' which is currently pending in the \n     Congress as H.R. 3427 and S. 1479.\n       2. Duly authenticated copies of this resolution, signed by \n     the Speaker of the General Assembly and attested by the Clerk \n     of the General Assembly, shall be transmitted to the \n     presiding officers of the United States Congress, each of the \n     members of the Congress elected from the State of New Jersey, \n     and the President of the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-424. A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Hawaii relative to improving \n     the quality of the nation's public schools by substantially \n     increasing education funding; to the Committee on Health, \n     Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 47\n\n       Whereas, the State of Hawaii has long pursued the goal of \n     improving the academic performance of all students regardless \n     of race, income, ethnicity, or disability; and\n       Whereas, the State of Hawaii commends the President and the \n     United States Congress for putting forth the same goals in \n     the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB) and emphasizing \n     the urgency in improving the performance of all students; and\n       Whereas, the NCLB has encouraged necessary changes in \n     public education and was initially accompanied with \n     substantial increases in federal funding for public \n     elementary and secondary education; and\n       Whereas, however, the increases in federal funding since \n     the inaugural year of the NCLB have been minimal; and\n       Whereas, the Federal Government has decreased funding in \n     fiscal year 2006 by:\n       (1) $793,000,000 for the NCLB;\n       (2) $166,000,000 for post secondary education; and\n       (3) $21,000,000 for programs that serve students with \n     disabilities; Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-\n     third Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of \n     2006, the Senate concurring, That the Legislature urges the \n     President of the United States and the United States Congress \n     to support improving the quality of the nation's public \n     schools by substantially increasing funding for the No Child \n     Left Behind Act, Higher Education Act, Individuals with \n     Disabilities Education Act, and other education-related \n     programs; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the State of Hawaii encourages other states \n     to adopt similar resolutions; and be it further\n       Resolved, That certified copies of this Concurrent \n     Resolution be transmitted to President of the United States, \n     President of the United States Senate, Speaker of the United \n     States House of Representatives, Secretary of the United \n     States Department of Education, and each member of Hawaii's \n     Congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-425.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     Michigan relative to the Gaylord, Michigan, mail processing \n     center; to the Committee on Homeland Security and \n     Governmental Affairs.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 151\n\n       Whereas, Gaylord, Michigan, is the largest city in Otsego \n     County and one of the fastest growing and economically \n     vibrant cities in northern Michigan. The Gaylord Post Office \n     handles mail in the 487 zip codes, which covers a sprawling \n     area from Grayling to Sault Saint Marie and from Petoskey to \n     Alpena. The post office's mail plant processes packages and \n     flats, such as magazines, newspapers, legal documents, and \n     mail larger than letter-size; and\n       Whereas, in April 2006, the United States Postal Service \n     concluded an Area Mail Processing (AMP) survey to determine \n     whether or not to consolidate Gaylord mail processing \n     operations into the Traverse City Processing & Distribution \n     Center. The postal service is considering consolidation in \n     order to reduce the $8 million deficit of the Greater \n     Michigan Postal District, which includes Wisconsin, Illinois, \n     and Indiana. District postal officials are expected to \n     receive final word from Washington, D.C., in either June or \n     July of this year; and\n       Whereas, if both packaging and flats processing are \n     eliminated, then nearly 80 full-time employees are expected \n     to be transferred out of the region to other postal \n     facilities. This transfer will have a detrimental impact on \n     the Gaylord economy as well-paying jobs flee the area. \n     Moreover, closing the Gaylord mail processing operations will \n     result in a lower standard of service because without the \n     processing center mail cannot be delivered to this vast \n     region in an efficient and timely manner; Now, there, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we memorialize the United \n     States Postal Service and the United States Congress to keep \n     open the Gaylord, Michigan, mail processing center; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the United States Postmaster General, the President of the \n     United States Senate, the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, and the members of the Michigan \n     congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-427. A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State\n\n[[Page S9307]]\n\n     of Hawaii relative to the convention on the elimination of \n     all forms of discrimination against women; to the Committee \n     on the Judiciary.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 67\n\n       Whereas, International Women's Day, celebrated throughout \n     the world on March 8th, is a time to:\n       (1) Reflect on the status of women in the United States and \n     around the world;\n       (2) Assess the progress made and the challenges for women \n     remaining; and\n       (3) Recommit to women's human rights and the full \n     empowerment of the world's women as the basis for truly \n     sustainable social, economic, and political development of \n     nations and communities; and\n       Whereas, two hundred twenty-eight million women are in need \n     of effective contraceptive methods; and\n       Whereas, a woman dies every minute as a result of pregnancy \n     and childbirth-related causes (approximately five hundred \n     women a year) and for every woman who dies, thirty other \n     women are injured or disabled; and\n       Whereas, between seven hundred thousand and four million \n     people, mainly women and children, are trafficked annually \n     across international borders for sexual exploitation and \n     forced labor; and\n       Whereas, fifty thousand to one hundred thousand women and \n     girls are trafficked annually for sexual exploitation into \n     the United States; and\n       Whereas, HIV/AIDS is a women's epidemic worldwide with over \n     nineteen million women worldwide currently living with HIV/\n     AIDS and over one million women dying of AIDS in 2002; and\n       Whereas, for the last several years, HIV/AIDS has been the \n     fifth leading cause of death for women ages twenty-five to \n     forty-four years in the United States, and the third leading \n     cause of death for African American women in this same age \n     group; and\n       Whereas, gender-based violence against women, including \n     prenatal sex selection, female infanticide, sexual abuse, \n     female genital mutilation, school and workplace sexual \n     harassment, sexual trafficking and exploitation, \n     prostitution, dowry-killings, domestic violence, battering, \n     and marital rape, causes more death and disability among \n     women in the fifteen to forty-four-year age group than \n     cancer, malaria, traffic accidents, and even war; and\n       Whereas, approximately four million eight hundred thousand \n     rapes and physical assaults are perpetrated annually against \n     women in the United States; and\n       Whereas, women in many countries lack the right to own land \n     and inherit property, obtain credit, attend and stay in \n     school, earn income, and be free from job discrimination, \n     they also lack access to services that meet their sexual and \n     reproductive health needs; and\n       Whereas, over two billion women around the globe live on \n     less than $2 a day, and women in the United States earn \n     seventy-three cents on average for every dollar earned by \n     men; and\n       Whereas, two-thirds of the nine hundred sixty million \n     illiterate adults in the world are women and two-thirds of \n     the one hundred thirty million children not enrolled in \n     primary school are girls; and\n       Whereas, in 1972, Hawaii became the first state to ratify \n     the federal Equal Rights Amendment, which would have amended \n     the United States Constitution by adding a guarantee of equal \n     rights for women; and\n       Whereas, in 2003, the Hawaii State House of Representatives \n     adopted House Resolution No. 59, which: supported \n     International Women's Day; urged the United States Senate to \n     ratify the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of \n     Discrimination Against Women; and further urged the United \n     States Congress to fund high quality, voluntary family \n     planning and reproductive health services; Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-\n     third Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of \n     2006, the Senate concurring, That the United States Senate is \n     requested to demonstrate our nation's commitment to human \n     rights by ratifying the Convention on the Elimination of All \n     Forms of Discrimination Against Women, and joining one \n     hundred seventy other nations in endorsing the most \n     comprehensive treaty ensuring the fundamental human rights \n     and equality of women; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the United States Congress is urged to \n     affirm every woman's fundamental right to reproductive \n     health, including the ability to choose the number of \n     children they will have and the timing of their births, by \n     funding high quality, voluntary family planning and \n     reproductive health services that enable women to exercise \n     this right; and be it further\n       Resolved, That certified copies of this Concurrent \n     Resolution be transmitted to the President of the United \n     States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives, and the members of Hawaii's congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-428. A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Hawaii relative to the \n     detonation of the Bravo Hydrogen Bomb over Bikini Atoll; to \n     the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 34\n\n       Whereas, at 6:45 a.m. on March 1, 1954, over Bikini Atoll, \n     the United States of America tested a hydrogen bomb device, \n     which is acknowledged to be the most powerful nuclear \n     explosion ever detonated; and\n       Whereas, the ``Bravo'' H-Bomb inadvertently yielded fifteen \n     megatons instead of the five megatons expected by the \n     scientists working on the project--a yield one thousand times \n     more powerful than the bomb dropped on the city of Hiroshima; \n     and\n       Whereas, including the Bravo H-Bomb, sixty-seven nuclear \n     tests were conducted at Bikini Atoll and Enewetak Atoll \n     between 1946 and 1958, exposing the people of the Republic of \n     the Marshall Islands to severe health problems and genetic \n     anomalies due to the tests, such as ``jelly fish'' babies and \n     other anomalies in the children, grandchildren, and great-\n     grandchildren of survivors; and\n       Whereas, Enewetak Atoll served as ground zero for forty-\n     three tests, eventually causing the exile of its people from \n     their homeland for thirty-three years; and\n       Whereas, even after a massive cleanup program by the United \n     States, more than fifty-seven percent of the land is not safe \n     for human habitation; and\n       Whereas, at the advice of the United States, the residents \n     of Bikini Atoll were repatriated to their homeland in 1967 \n     only to be evacuated seven years later when high levels of \n     radionuclides were discovered in their bodies; and\n       Whereas, the people of neighboring Rongelap and Utirik were \n     also returned prematurely to their atolls and received \n     additional exposure, causing many to believe that they were \n     used to study the effects of radiation on human beings as \n     evidenced in the Atomic Energy Commission's now infamous \n     Project 4.1 ``Study of Response of Human Beings Exposed to \n     Significant Beta and Gamma Radiation due to Fallout from High \n     Yield Weapons''; and\n       Whereas, in the Compact of Free Association (Compact), the \n     United States ``accepts the responsibility for compensation \n     owing to the citizens of the Marshall Islands . . . for loss \n     or damage to property and person . . . resulting from the \n     nuclear testing program which the Government of the United \n     States conducted in the Northern Marshall Islands between \n     June 30, 1946 and August 18, 1958''; and\n       Whereas, the pertinent provisions of the Compact were \n     negotiated based on limited and misleading information \n     provided by the United States Government to the \n     representatives of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, a \n     fact only recently exposed in material declassified by the \n     United States and acknowledged by officials; and\n       Whereas, the ``changed circumstances'' provisions of the \n     Compact provide that, should it become manifestly clear that \n     the agreement on nuclear matters is grossly inadequate to \n     meet the technological and financial requirements anticipated \n     during the negotiations, or if new information emerges that \n     render those agreements insufficient for the purpose of \n     concluding full and just compensation, the Congress of the \n     United States would consider a petition on the issue; and\n       Whereas, the Republic of the Marshall Islands submitted \n     such a ``Changed Circumstances'' petition on September 11, \n     2000, based on recently declassified data; and\n       Whereas, the Bush administration recently took a stand \n     against further compensation under the Changed Circumstances \n     petition, and\n       Whereas, just compensation and continued funding for \n     promised medical and health programs for survivors of the \n     atomic tests now depend upon Congress' favorable \n     consideration of this petition; and\n       Whereas, over the past seventeen years, Hawaii has provided \n     medical, educational, and other supportive services to lawful \n     non-immigrants from the Republic of the Marshall Islands, \n     without receiving adequate reimbursement from the United \n     States; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-\n     third Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of \n     2006, the Senate concurring, That the United States Congress \n     is respectfully requested to enact appropriate measures to \n     provide for the full health needs of the hydrogen bomb tests \n     survivors and their progeny, pay appropriate property damage \n     claims, and provide for the costs of cleaning up nuclear \n     sites in the Republic of the Marshall Islands in connection \n     with hydrogen bomb testing on atolls of the Republic of the \n     Marshall Islands; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature expresses deep regret for \n     the harm done to the people of the Republic of the Marshall \n     Islands and their homeland and hereby requests the Governor \n     to declare March 1st as a Day of Remembrance for the \n     survivors of the United States nuclear tests in the Republic \n     of the Marshall Islands;

A bill to impose sanctions against individuals responsible \nfor genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity, to support \nmeasures for the protection of civilians and humanitarian operations, \nand to support peace efforts in the Darfur region of Sudan, and for \nother purposes; read the first time.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that is a \nproduct of a significant amount of consideration and work within our \nCongress over the last year and a half. The Darfur Peace and \nAccountability Act of 2006 has had many iterations since both the \nSenate and the House introduced legislation by the same name in 2005. \nEach piece of legislation that has been introduced has contributed to \nCongress's understanding of this issue and has ensured a more complete \nand thoughtful response.\n  There is a consensus within Congress that the genocidal policies of \nthe Bashir regime in Sudan must be condemned and opposed. Many Members \nhave introduced bills and resolutions dealing with the crisis, and \nMembers have been vocal about the urgency of this issue through \nhearings, statements, visits to the region, and other activities. This \nconsensus has been supported by numerous groups and individual \nAmericans who have lent their voices to the effort to prevent genocide \nand their resources to provide relief to those in the region who are \nfacing violence and bleak circumstances.\n  The legislation I am introducing today is intended to provide a \nvehicle upon which Members can quickly concur and consolidate their \nefforts in providing needed authorities for our State Department and \ntargeted sanctions to compel Khartoum to comply with their agreements. \nRegrettably, the Darfur Peace Agreement appears to be faltering with \nthe ill-advised rejection of the U.N. resolution establishing a U.N. \npeacekeeping force to transition from the overburdened African Union \nmission in Sudan. The situation has become insecure for humanitarian \noperations and as threatening to the people of the region as it has \never been. The United Nations Security Council resolution authorizing a \npeacekeeping force for Darfur is a unanimous signal that the \ninternational community is\n\n[[Page S9310]]\n\ncommitted to seeing no further violence take place in Darfur. Sudan, as \na member of the United Nations, must abide by this decision of the \ninternational community. Their national and international \nresponsibility is to serve and protect their people, and the suffering \nand killing in Darfur must end. The gargantuan humanitarian effort to \nprovide basic necessities for more than 2 million displaced persons \nrequires unrestricted access by national and international aid \norganizations, as well as the U.N.-mandated peacekeeping force to \nensure their security.\n  This legislation also seeks to help consolidate the difficult road to \nrecovery in southern Sudan in accordance with the Comprehensive Peace \nAgreement for Sudan. I have included additional authorities for our \nofficials to provide assistance to southern Sudan, as well as Darfur. \nSuch economic and military assistance is necessary and requires close \nconsultation with Congress to ensure assistance is not manipulated or \nmisdirected. The bill also sustains existing sanctions on Sudan in \ndirect response to their violation of agreements they have made. The \nPresident will have the authority to waive these restrictions if he \ndetermines such action is in our national interest; so the flexibility \nhe requires is there as well.\n  Finally, in further support of peace and to assist U.S. diplomats, \ntargeted sanctions are authorized on individuals whom the President \ndetermines are ``complicit in, or responsible for, acts of genocide, \nwar crimes, or crimes against humanity in Darfur.'' These sanctions \ninclude blocking assets and refusing to grant individuals entry to the \nUnited States. Further, this legislation encourages the President to \nprevent entry at our ports to certain ships in order to deny the \nGovernment of Sudan oil revenues and access to deliveries of military \nequipment. The only exception to such entry should be for those vessels \nproviding assistance in carrying out the elements of the Sudan peace \nagreements or humanitarian assistance.\n  Shifting circumstances on the ground in Sudan and at the United \nNations have complicated our efforts to achieve consensus on \nlegislation that would help our diplomats resolve the Darfur crisis. I \nbelieve this legislation can win majority support in the Senate, and I \nhope it will receive favorable consideration in the House.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DORGAN (for himself, Mrs. Murray, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Leahy, \n        Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. \n        Lieberman):\n  S. 3887. A bill to prohibit the Internal Revenue Service from using \nprivate debt collection companies, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I am joined by Senator Murray and \nseven of our Senate colleagues in introducing legislation to stop the \nInternal Revenue Service's plan to outsource part of its tax collection \nresponsibilities to private collection companies.\n  It would be a serious mistake for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) \nto move ahead with its controversial tax debt collection privatization \nplan. When the IRS attempted a similar plan in 1996, it failed \nmiserably. Mistakes were made at every turn. Taxpayers were harassed by \nprivate debt collectors. In many instances, private debt collectors \nviolated Federal debt collection laws and confidential taxpayer \ninformation was not properly secured.\n  Serious concerns have been raised by tax experts, including the \nNational Taxpayer Advocate, that the new IRS initiative will suffer \nfrom the same kinds of maladies. It is my understanding that the IRS \nintends to share more than 2.5 million taxpayer accounts with ten \nprivate collection companies when its new plan is fully implemented. \nThere is troubling evidence which suggests that the IRS plan may not \nhave adequate safeguards in place to protect confidential taxpayer \ninformation.\n  Just over two years ago, a Treasury Inspector General for Tax \nAdministration (TIGTA) investigation found that a contractor's \nemployees committed security violations, placing IRS equipment and \ntaxpayer data at risk. In some cases, TIGTA officials found that \ncontractors ``blatantly circumvented IRS policies and procedures even \nwhen security personnel had identified inappropriate practices.''\n  It is also troubling that the IRS has agreed to pay very large \ncommissions of 21 to 24 percent of the amount of the tax debt collected \nby three private collection firms at the outset of its initiative. Some \ntax experts understand what others are choosing to ignore: paying a \ncommission based on the firms' success increases the potential for \noverzealous collection practices and the misuse of sensitive taxpayer \ninformation. Private debt collection agencies are driven by profit \nmotives, not public service.\n  In addition, the IRS admits that if it hired more employees for this \npurpose, not private collectors, far more revenues would be deposited \nin the U.S. Treasury fund. It is astounding that the IRS appears ready \nto pay nearly a quarter for every dollar collected by private \ncollection firms, when internal IRS reports suggest that it would cost \nthe Federal Government just 3 pennies on a dollar to have trained IRS \nemployees collect tax debts that are owed. At a time of exploding \ndeficits and Federal debt, the IRS plan to use of private debt \ncollectors would be an inexcusable waste of taxpayer money.\n  Everybody needs to pay the taxes they owe. If they do not, however, \nprofessional IRS employees, not private collectors in search of \nprofits, should be the ones to ensure that outstanding tax debts are \npaid. If the IRS now says it needs more resources for tax enforcement \nand collection activities, then Congress should consider providing \nthem.\n  I fully agree with the independent Taxpayer Advocacy Panel's recent \nrecommendation that the IRS ``should abandon all plans to outsource any \ntaxpayer debts and restrict collection activities to properly trained \nand proficient IRS personnel.'' Indeed, the IRS should immediately \nreverse course and indefinitely suspend the implementation of its \nprivate debt collection plan.\n  It was recently reported in the press that IRS Commissioner Everson \nhas said the IRS will ``immediately stand down'' if the House and \nSenate act to revoke its authority to outsource tax debt collections to \nprivate companies. The House of Representatives has already voted to \nkill new funding for this IRS initiative. I will be pushing for a vote \non this proposal by the full Senate at the first available opportunity.\n  The IRS should act on its own to stop its planned use of private debt \ncollectors and save any further expenditures of taxpayer money for this \npurpose. If not, however, I will do everything in my power to put the \nbrakes on this plan in the U.S. Senate.\n  There is an old adage: ``Those who cannot learn from history are \ndoomed to repeat it.'' Someone needs to remind the Internal Revenue \nService and even some in the Congress of that. I urge my colleagues to \ncosponsor this legislation and help us get it enacted into law.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am glad to join my colleague, Senator \nDorgan, and other cosponsors, in introducing legislation which would \nprevent the use of private collection agencies by the Internal Revenue \nService. As Ranking Member of the Transportation, Treasury, the \nJudiciary, HUD, and Related Agencies (TTHUD) Appropriations \nSubcommittee, I have consistently opposed allowing the IRS the \nauthority to hire private debt collectors. During Subcommittee hearings \nwith the IRS, I have had the opportunity to discuss this issue at \nlength with the current IRS Commissioner, Mark Everson. What I have \nlearned during those conversations has not changed my mind.\n  When Chairman Bond and I finally are allowed to bring the Fiscal Year \n2007 Transportation/Treasury Appropriations bill to the Senate Floor, I \nintend to offer an amendment that would effectively prohibit the IRS \nfrom going forward with this initiative. My amendment will be very \nsimilar to the bill we introduce today and the language that is already \nincluded in the House-passed Transportation/Treasury bill. I would \npoint out, that the House Transportation/Treasury bill cleared the \nHouse of Representatives with the support of more than 400 Members.\n  There is no question that people who owe back taxes must pay their \ndebt to the government. At the same time, every taxpayer should have \nthe right to interact with a professional IRS agent when it comes to \ndealing with contested tax liabilities.\n\n[[Page S9311]]\n\n  I'm against the use of private collection agencies (PCAs) because, \nfirst, I don't believe that taxpayer privacy will be adequately \nprotected. When the IRS attempted the use of PCAs once before in the \n1990s, it was a dismal failure. The IRS has not had a good track record \nof protecting taxpayer information and the Treasury Department's \nperformance in providing information security protections to protect \ndata confidentiality has worsened.\n  Second, I am concerned that private debt collectors will not show the \nlevel of professionalism, sensitivity, and respect that taxpayers \ndeserve. In 2005, the Federal Trade Commission received more consumer \ncomplaints about private debt collectors than any other industry.\n  Due to the nature of the debts that the IRS intends to transfer to \nPCAs, the likely result will be that these agencies will end up going \nafter the most vulnerable taxpayers in our society. We should not allow \na system to emerge where better-off taxpayers get the benefit of \ninteracting with a professional IRS agent, while economically-\ndisadvantaged taxpayers are relegated to the harassing tactics of \nprivate collection agencies.\n  Third, I am deeply concerned with the cost-effectiveness of this \ninitiative. The IRS Commissioner, himself, testified that it would be \nmore cost-effective for the IRS to collect these debts than to contract \nthem out to PCAs. Initially, I am told that it will require 55 IRS \npersonnel to oversee 75 private tax collectors. Taken as a whole, I \nhave to wonder whether the Federal Treasury will really benefit at all \nfrom this initiative.\n  Finally, the IRS should not be moving ahead with this activity while \nCongress is still debating its merits. More than 400 Members of the \nHouse approved a bill that included a prohibition on outsourcing tax \ncollection. The IRS should suspend this effort immediately until the \nCongress has debated its fate and reached a final judgment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/11/senate-section/article/S9311-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9311]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 565--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE UPON THE \n   FIVE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF THE TERRORIST ATTACKS AGAINST THE UNITED \n                      STATES ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001\n\n  Mr. FRIST (for himself, Mr. Reid, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Alexander, \nMr. Allard, Mr. Allen, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Biden, \nMr. Bingaman, Mr. Bond, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Bunning, Mr. \nBurns, Mr. Burr, Mr. Byrd, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Carper, Mr. Chafee, Mr. \nChambliss, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Coburn, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Coleman, Ms. \nCollins, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Craig, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Dayton, Mr. \nDeMint, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Dodd, Mrs. Dole, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. \nDurbin, Mr. Ensign, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Feingold, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Graham, \nMr. Grassley, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Hatch, Mrs. \nHutchison, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. \nJohnson, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Kohl, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. \nLautenberg, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Levin, Mr. Lieberman, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. \nLott, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Martinez, Mr. McCain, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Menendez, \nMs. Mikulski, Ms. Murkowski, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. \nNelson of Nebraska, Mr. Obama, Mr. Pryor, Mr. Reed, Mr. Roberts, Mr. \nRockefeller, Mr. Salazar, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Schumer, Mr. \nSessions, Mr. Shelby, Mr. Smith, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Specter, Ms. Stabenow, \nMr. Stevens, Mr. Sununu, Mr. Talent, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Thune, Mr. Vitter, \nMr. Voinovich, Mr. Warner, and Mr. Wyden) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, about an hour ago a number of Members of \nthe House and the Senate, principally leadership, participated in a \nwreath-laying ceremony by the President at the Pentagon. The President \nhas participated over the last 48 hours in similar events in New York, \nearlier today in Pennsylvania, and later at the Pentagon today.\n  A number of colleagues have come to the Senate to offer statements in \nremembrance of that day 5 years ago and that question of: What were you \ndoing? Whom did you talk to? What were your memories? Whom were you \nwith? This is a familiar question and one we have all gone back over \nthe course of the last several days and thought about.\n  I remember where I was. I remember exactly what I was doing. I \nremember whom I was with. I was across the street in the Russell \nBuilding with my chief of staff, Emily Reynolds, at the time, who is \nnow Secretary of the Senate. We were in a meeting with a colleague of \nmine, Senator Hutchison, talking over issues, when a member of her \nstaff came in and told us that a plane had struck the Twin Towers.\n  At that time, it was thought initially to be a corporate plane, but \nas a pilot it was very clear to me that would not have happened by \naccident. While our discussion continued for a few moments, someone \nwheeled in a television, and then, dumbstruck, we watched that second \nplane strike the tower. Shortly thereafter, of course, we heard there \nwas smoke coming from the Pentagon, where we were a few moments ago. \nClearly, we were under attack.\n  I remember my first phone call home. We all remember our phone calls, \nreaching out to touch others whom we loved. I called my wife Karyn. \nImmediately, we talked about what should be done with our three boys \nwho were at school in Washington, DC.\n  Of course, later that afternoon, we were standing on the steps of the \nCapitol with so many of our colleagues, spontaneously, together, \nbreaking out in ``God Bless America,'' to let the world know that \nAmerica will not cower to such terrorism. Indeed, in about 30 minutes, \na number of our colleagues from both the House and the Senate will, \nonce again, go to those Senate steps.\n  Those are the moments that are indelibly etched into my mind in terms \nof where I was and whom I was with. But it really goes out to the \npeople we were just with over at the Pentagon, as I talked to one man I \nnever met before whom, as we were waiting just prior to the ceremony, I \nturned to and introduced myself. He told me his story, his story of \nAmelia, who, on her second day of work, indeed, her birthday, September \n11, 5 years ago, at the Pentagon was struck and died. And then there \nare the images of all the first responders--the law enforcement, the \nfirefighters, the police, and the volunteers--and the family responses. \nAll of those feelings come tumbling in.\n  Nearly 3,000 Americans lost their lives to those vicious acts of \nterror that day. The attacks shattered the longstanding illusions I had \nthrough my entire life of safety and security, at least in this great \ncountry of ours. Indeed, we found ourselves hard pressed on every side \nbut not crushed; perplexed but not in despair; persecuted but not \nabandoned; struck down but not destroyed.\n\n[[Page S9319]]\n\n  Instead, we pressed on, pushing every hindrance aside with resolve, \ncalling upon our most fundamental beliefs about America, many going \nback over the ensuing days addressing what makes us uniquely American.\n  We pressed on, coming together and sending forth thousands of those \nfirst responders, thousands of those policemen, paramedics, \nconstruction workers, and other rescue workers to Ground Zero and the \nPentagon.\n  I remember a few days after the Pentagon was struck going out and \nwelcoming an entire delegation of first responders from Tennessee, with \nthat American flag displayed so proudly and that Tennessee flag right \nnext to it.\n  We pressed on, facing down that economic shock and developing new \nrespect for our economy's natural resilience and a new respect for the \neconomy's ability and resiliency to bounce back.\n  We pressed on, immediately in this body, addressing issues of \nintelligence, of making sure we not only mobilized our troops but we \nsupported them with the very best equipment that we could.\n  We pressed on by taking the fight to the enemy because we knew that \nif we did not, that fight would come to us.\n  With the passage of 5 years' time, some things begin, inevitably, to \nblur. That is why in some ways it is so useful to have remembrances \nlike what we have had over the course of today.\n  We forget a time when we had a great fear of even boarding airplanes. \nWe forget a time when we held our children--and those days, weeks, and \nmonths afterwards; it was so, so, so close--but we forget that time of \nholding our kids just a little bit longer with that hug before they \nwent off to school. And we forget a time when we felt that hatred in \nthe heart of our enemy. The feelings that were once so vivid, so \nsharp--that shock, that anger, that fury--the fear began to lose the \njagged edge with time. In part, that is part of this Nation's healing--\ncoming together, responding in a healing way to a catastrophe--because \nwe should not live in fear. We cannot be a nation that lives in fear. \nSalesmen go out traveling on business, families who are out traveling \non vacations should not fear boarding that plane to fly. Parents \nloading their children on a bus, they should not fear sending them off \nto school.\n  But there is also a danger in forgetting. There is a danger in having \ntime pass and letting those memories fade because as time fades we also \nstart to forget the enemy who took those 3,000 lives so prematurely. We \nforget the intentions they harbor and the agenda they champion.\n  There was a stark reminder for me yesterday, as I joined Senator \nMcConnell and Senator Specter, as we went to Guantanamo Bay, to the \ndetention facility there. And when you walk those grounds--a remarkable \nplace in and of itself and the entity itself in terms of treating those \ndetainees in a safe and humane way, which is very possible--in walking \nthose grounds, it causes you to think back to 5 years ago, to what \nprecipitated that event which caused the loss of 3,000 and destroyed \nthe lives of so many thousands of others.\n  We cannot become complacent because if we do, we will be struck \nagain. Our enemy remembers. Our enemy plans. And I was reminded again \nand again yesterday, as I toured those grounds, our enemy continues to \nplan, continues to plot, continues to conspire--conspires to see us \nlose in Iraq, plots to drive us out of Afghanistan, plans to attack us \nhere, right here, again in the United States. We know that because over \nthese last 5 years, at least 11 times such plots have been promoted. \nThat is why we cannot afford to grow complacent. We cannot afford to \nlet our resolve waiver. We have to continue to press on. We have to \ncontinue to strengthen our security.\n  That is why on this floor, in the bill that has been talked about \nthis afternoon and the bills we will address over the coming days, we \nare focusing on a security agenda. It is an agenda that includes \nreplenishing our critical supplies for troops on the ground--we just \nfinished the Department of Defense appropriations bill on the Senate \nfloor last week--eliminating vulnerabilities and closing the gaps in \nport security, the bill on the floor today; and, indeed, in the near \nfuture, creating military commissions to try the enemy combatants, the \nterrorists who are captured on the field of battle, and bolstering the \nterrorist surveillance program to make sure our law enforcement and our \nGovernment are appropriately equipped to be able to detect terrorism \nbefore an event happens.\n  Here in the Senate we have worked tirelessly to ease the burden on \nour memories. That is why we are safer now than we were 5 years ago. \nConsider there has not been a successful terrorist attack against the \nhomeland.\n  But safety and security are not static points in time.
