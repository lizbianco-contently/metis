Mr. President, I rise today for the first time as a \nSenator from the State of South Dakota. First and foremost, I thank the \npeople of South Dakota for putting their trust in me, for sending me to \nfight for their values and to represent them here in Washington, DC.\n  I had the distinct pleasure of serving the State of South Dakota for \nthree terms in the House of Representatives, and now I am looking \nforward to continuing my service to South Dakota and to our Nation here \nin the Senate. I decided to run for the Senate because I believe we can \nmake better progress on an agenda that strengthens our Nation and \nincreases the prosperity of every American. We have a lot of work to \ndo, and we should not let partisanship or political gamesmanship get in \nthe way of this agenda.\n  The Senate is known for its deliberative qualities, most commonly \nmanifested through the right to free debate. This quality is part of \nthe fiber of the Senate, part of the character that makes it one of the \nmost august institutions in the world.\n  Some of the greatest debates in our Nation's history have taken place \nin this very Chamber, from the 19th century debates on slavery and the \nRepublic to the 20th century debates on civil rights and Social \nSecurity. While there is time to debate, we all came here to solve \nproblems, not pass them on to our children. I think I speak for many \nMembers when I say that the only thing that sustains me when I am away \nfrom my children is the knowledge that we are improving their lives \nthrough our work. That is why I firmly\n\n[[Page S1220]]\n\nhope that Congress can work together to do more than simply debate our \nproblems, but work together to solve them.\n  There are some goals that we can all agree on: a national energy \npolicy that increases the use of renewable fuels, more affordable and \naccessible health care, and meaningful tort reform. We are, in fact, on \nthe eve of passing class action reform that will restore fairness to \nthe judicial system in this country. Our tort system is broken and, \nwithout the necessary reforms, beginning with class action lawsuits, we \ndeny our Nation not only fair and efficient access to justice, but we \nallow this problem to pull our economy downward. Excessive and often \nunnecessary litigation expenses cost us in terms of lost jobs, lost \ngrowth, and lost revenues every day that it goes unabated. We have a \nfull agenda ahead of us. The American people have put their trust in us \nto make this Nation even greater than it is today, and we cannot let \nthem down.\n  Part of the task before us, and the reason I rise today, is the need \nto fix Social Security. Social Security as the system exists today is \nin danger. While the system has provided 70 years' worth of benefits to \nour Nation's retirees, the system as we know it today will no longer be \nable to keep that promise for the next generation.\n  I understand the intergenerational aspect of this discussion. My \nfather turned 85 in December. My mom will be 84 in May. My father has \nserved his country as a combat pilot in World War II. He has shot down \nenemy warplanes for his country. He and my mother rely--depend upon \nSocial Security. We need to keep faith in our promise to them.\n  But I also have teenage daughters. I understand, if we do nothing to \nimprove this system, that our children and grandchildren will not see \nthe Social Security benefits they are counting on receiving. Today's \nseniors, like my mom and dad back in Murdo, SD, and those nearing \nretirement age, can be assured that their benefits are safe and sound. \nThe same cannot be said for my two daughters and the rest of their \ngeneration.\n\n  The explanation of why this is happening is not that difficult to \nunderstand. In 1950, there were 16 workers for every retiree. Today, \nthere are only three workers for every retiree. Soon there will be only \ntwo workers for every one retiree. Our Nation is aging and, as more and \nmore Americans leave the workforce for retirement, there are fewer and \nfewer workers paying into the system. The current system is \nunsustainable given the changing demographics of this country.\n  Some may ask, When will we start to see the effects from these \nchanges? The Social Security trustees have told us that beginning in \n2018, Social Security will begin paying out more in benefits than it is \ntaking in. This means that we will need to start raising taxes, cutting \nspending, or reducing benefits in just 13 years to cover the promises \nthat have been made to our retirees. In 2042 the system will no longer \nbe able to pay full benefits without major restructuring.\n  Some will say those dates sound like they are a long ways off, but as \nthe Vice President recently put it, some might be inclined to ``kick \nthe can further down the road,'' leaving the problem for another \nPresident and another Congress to fix. Thirteen years is not that far \naway. Believe me, if you have children you know how quickly those first \n12 years can go by, and all of a sudden you have a teenager. It \nhappened to me twice with my two daughters. So the problems with Social \nSecurity are not going away, and the longer we wait, the more expensive \nthe solution will be and the more painful to the American taxpayer.\n  The Social Security trustees have told us that if we wait to solve \nthis problem, we are facing a $10.4 trillion shortfall. Experts agree \nthat if we work on solving the problem today, that cost will be closer \nto $1 trillion--$1 trillion today, $10 trillion later.\n  My teenage daughters--and I daresay most Americans--can understand \nthe dimensions of that problem. It is our duty to fix this problem now.\n  Possible solutions are numerous. Many include personal retirement \naccounts which would create a nest egg for younger generations. These \nvoluntary accounts would allow younger workers to save some of their \npayroll taxes in a personal account for their retirement. In fact, they \nwould most likely be fashioned like the Thrift Savings Plan that is \navailable to Federal employees. With personal retirement accounts, our \nchildren and grandchildren will be able to get more out of the Social \nSecurity system when they retire. In addition, they will have something \nto pass on to their children.\n  No matter how the solution is fashioned, current retirees and those \nnearing retirement do not have to worry about their benefits. They have \nput their time in, and their benefits will be there for them, no matter \nwhat happens.\n  I have laid out the stakes here today, and it is clear that they \ncould not be much higher. I call on members of both parties to be open \nto the ideas that are put on the table. Refrain from playing on the \nfears that often surround this issue. And for those of you who worry \nabout political danger in discussing this issue, know that I am \nstanding here today before you as a Senator who has been on the \nreceiving end of many of those accusations and attacks--the key words \nbeing, I am still standing here as a Senator today. I believe we can do \nmore than send and receive political attacks on this issue. We can work \ntogether to find a strong bipartisan solution.\n  As those of us here in Washington begin to debate the issue of Social \nSecurity reform, I ask that we think not about our next election but in \nfact about the next generation--our children and our grandchildren. The \nsame goes for seniors. I ask that they fight the temptation to be \nconcerned about their next Social Security check, because it is going \nto be there, no matter what. Instead, I ask that they also think about \nour children and our grandchildren. Their future is what this debate is \nall about. I for one intend to fight to make it a better future. I hope \nmy colleagues in this Chamber will join me.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I congratulate the new Senator from \nSouth Dakota on his initial speech in the Senate. I say to him that he \ncould not have picked a more important topic than saving Social \nSecurity for our children. I had the pleasure to be here and listen to \nhis speech. I have had an opportunity to get to know the Senator from \nSouth Dakota over the last few years.\n  I want to say again on behalf of all of our colleagues, welcome to \nthe Senate, and congratulations on an outstanding speech.\n  Mr. THUNE. I thank the distinguished whip for his kind remarks.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/10/senate-section/article/S1220-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1220-S1222]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SOCIAL SECURITY\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, this morning's paper has in it once \nagain, as we often get here in Washington, a poll. It seems everything \nwe do is focused on polls and what the people think. This poll is on \nthe question of whether there is a crisis in Social Security. Frankly, \nthe numbers are confusing, because it depends on the definition. If the \nquestion is whether there is a problem, there is a majority who say \nthere is a problem; there is a smaller percentage that say there is a \ncrisis, and so on. It gets very confusing.\n  I would like to speak today in answer to the fundamental question \nposed by the poll, and do what I can to shed some light on the question \nof what condition Social Security is in.\n  I am not a newcomer to this. We have held hearings in the Joint \nEconomic Committee, while I have been chairman, examining this \nquestion. We have a body of institutional knowledge that we have put \ntogether now over the past year and a half. I want to pose and I hope \nanswer three fundamental questions here today that can be the basis for \nthe debate on Social Security.\n  Those questions are: No. 1, is there a problem? No. 2, if so, how big \nis it? No. 3, when will it hit?\n  With those three questions in mind, let us go forward. Individuals \ncome to me and ask these questions through the lens of their individual \nsituation. Is there a problem with Social Security? They are really \nasking, Is there a problem for me in Social Security? The answer to \nthat question is a question: When were you born?\n\n[[Page S1221]]\n\n  Stop and think for a minute of your own birth date, and then address \nthe question, Is Social Security going to be a problem for me? If you \nwere born in the 1930s, as I was, or if you were born in the 1940s, as \nmy wife was, or if you were born in the 1950s, as my nieces and nephews \nwere, the answer is no, there is not a problem for you with respect to \nSocial Security. Your benefits will be paid. They will be paid at the \nfull level the law requires. You do not have a problem with Social \nSecurity.\n\n  If you were born in the 1960s, as my children were, the question of \nwhether you have a problem depends on how long you will live. If you \nwere born in the 1960s and you live into your eighties, chances are in \nthe last few years of your life the Social Security benefits are going \nto be cut quite dramatically. If you manage to die before you get to \nage 80, then you won't have a problem.\n  If you were born in the 1970s, it is almost certain you will have a \nproblem. And if you were born in the 1980s, it is guaranteed that the \nSocial Security benefits will have to be cut before you reach \nretirement age.\n  For these young pages sitting here, it is very clear that if we don't \nstart to do something now, you will be penalized for your youth. The \nSocial Security benefits will be seriously curtailed for you.\n  Let us review some history to put some flesh on the bones as to \nwhether there is a problem. Think of Social Security in these terms: It \nis a little like a lottery. A lottery works this way: A lot of people \npay in, and only some people get paid out. So it produces winners and \nlosers. With Social Security, a lot of people pay in, and not all of \nthem get money out.\n  Here are the statistics which demonstrate what has been happening to \nthis lottery. In the 1940s, 54 percent of the workers who paid into the \nsystem lived long enough to be winners. This is the ideal political \nsituation, because the losers were dead. They were not in a position to \nprotest that they had paid in and had gotten nothing out. Fifty-four \npercent in 1940 of the men--and in 1940 our workforce and retiree \npopulation was almost entirely male--got money out of the lottery and \nthe other 46 percent who had paid in got nothing, but they weren't \ncomplaining because they were dead.\n  But then the women started to join the workforce, and now women make \nup as high a percentage of the workforce as men, and the age kept going \nup. Today, 72 percent of the men who paid into the lottery are eligible \nfor benefits, and 83 percent of the women who paid into the lottery are \neligible for benefits. Whereas it was 54 percent who were winners in \n1940, it is now 80 percent who are winners, and the number keeps going \nup.\n  There is another factor. This shows how many people get into the \nwinner side who are going to be drawing money from Social Security. How \nlong did they stay there? In 1940, once a man got to retirement age, he \nwould stay there on the average for 12 years. Women--there were fewer \nof them who were in the program--lived for 14.7 years. But the numbers \nkept going up. Today, a man will be in the program for 15 years, and a \nwoman for nearly 20. The average time people draw out their Social \nSecurity benefits has gone up from 12 to 18--a 50-percent increase.\n  You have many more people who get into the program by virtue of \nliving beyond the age of 65, and then once they are in the program they \nstay longer.\n  What is the obvious result of this kind of change in demographics? \nLet us see what has happened to the pool of people paying in.\n  In 1945, there were 42 people paying in for every one person drawing \nout. That is true because the program was still new enough that there \nwere not enough people old enough to take advantage of it. That came \ndown dramatically, as you would expect it would, as more and more \nretirees came on. In the 1950s, 5 years later, the number was down to \n17. Now it is down to 3, and the projections are that it will go down \nto 2. You cannot have that kind of a lottery where only two people are \npaying in for every person who is drawing out, while the people who are \ndrawing out are growing as a percentage of the whole program.\n\n  How do we deal with this? How have we dealt with this historically \nover this period? This is how we have dealt with it. Take the 50-year \nperiod from 1945 to 1995, and this is the list of tax rates that have \nbeen applied to Social Security. For 50 years of time, we have run into \none of these demographic problems. We have solved it by raising the tax \nrate.\n  I would like to demonstrate what Franklin Roosevelt and Congress in \n1936 promised the American people on this issue of tax rates. This is \nthe photograph of the brochure that was distributed to every recipient \nof Social Security in 1936. ``Security In Your Old Age, Social Security \nBoard, Washington, DC.''\n  Here is the quote from that pamphlet that was distributed to every \nSocial Security beneficiary. ``Beginning in 1949, twelve years from \nnow, you and your employer will each pay 3 cents on each dollar you \nearn up to $3,000 a year. That is the most you will ever pay.''\n  If ever there was a promise the Government made that the Government \nbroke, that is the promise.\n  Let us go back to the previous chart that shows the history.\n  This is the 3 percent that was promised in the 1930s; this is the \n12.4 percent we are paying 50 years later. That is a 300-percent \nincrease in tax rate. That is not 300 percent in dollars. That is a 300 \npercent increase in the rate to keep up with the demographic situation \nwe have seen.\n  I asked three questions: Is there a problem? How big is it? When will \nit hit?\n  I have cited the history. Now it is time to get prospective and talk \nabout what is coming.\n  All of the demographic statistics I have quoted are shown here on \nthis chart. It starts in 1950, and here is where we are now. This is \nthe percentage of Americans who are 65 or older. It has been going up. \nYet, it leveled off starting around 1990, and stayed stable; even went \ndown a little. But starting in 2008, something is going to happen. I \nstress the 2008, because a lot of the accountants have ignored that \nyear, and said, No, the crisis is in 2018, or 2042, or 2042 isn't \nright, it's 2052.\n  Here are the demographic realities of what we are facing. Starting in \n2008, this line is going to start up dramatically and steeply, and over \nthe period of the next 30 years the percentage of Americans who are 65 \nand older will double.\n  When will it hit? It will start to hit in 2008. That is not a long \nway off. That is within the term for which I was just elected--the 6-\nyear term that the people of Utah gave to me--that this problem is \ngoing to start to hit us. We have to deal with it or 30 years from now \nwe are going to end up with a population twice the percentage of the \nlevel it is now and no solution.\n  Let's look at what the Social Security Administration says this will \ndo. This is the chart of current benefits, current law. Here is the \nrevenue line; here is the cost line. How do we fill in the hole of the \ncost line that is much higher than the revenue line? This hole by \nitself is $1.5 trillion. Where is that $1.5 trillion going to come from \nto pay the benefits? It will have to come from either increased tax \nrevenues or increased borrowing to the public. Or it will have to come \nfrom some kind of increased rate of return on the money coming in down \nhere. Those are the only three ways to deal with it.\n  We should understand, once again, the pressure will start in 2008. It \nwill be gradual but it will build. And over the next 30 years, it will \noverwhelm us if we do not either raise the taxes, cut the benefits, or \nincrease the rate of return.\n  The proposals of what to do about this range across a wide spectrum \nof ideas. The President has focused on an idea that he thinks will \nraise the rate of return on the income coming in. Others have focused \non taxes. That is, indeed, how we have handled this for the last 50 \nyears. We have always raised taxes. Some have said we have to begin to \nadjust the benefits. All of these proposals should be on the table. All \nof these proposals should be discussed in perfectly good faith. I am \nwilling to discuss anything.\n  As I said at the outset, we have a history now in the committee that \nI have chaired of examining these issues. We believe we understand the \nrealities of the past and the challenges and opportunities of the \nfuture. We are willing to discuss with anyone any of these proposals \nand responsibilities.\n\n[[Page S1222]]\n\n  Remember, there is a problem. It is at the very least a $1.5 trillion \nproblem. It is going to start to hit us in 2008. Surely we in this \nChamber can in good faith recognize these facts and deal with them in a \nspirit of cooperation, reach out to the White House and try to find a \nsolution so these pages will not, in fact, be penalized for their youth \nand find themselves in a situation where they do not get the benefits \ntheir grandparents and others received. They will be paying into the \nsystem. They will not get the benefits the others have received unless \nwe lock arms, cooperate, and produce a solution.\n  My focus today has been to review the history of where the problem \nhas been and review the prospective demographic realities we face. At \nsome future time I will outline some of the solutions my committee has \ndiscovered might very well work as we try to find a way to deal with \nthis very real problem.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski).

Madam President, first I salute my colleague from Utah. I \nagree completely with his conclusion--completely. We need to get \ntogether on a bipartisan basis and talk about the future of Social \nSecurity. That should be the starting point.\n  Unfortunately, it is not the starting point. The starting point is a \nproposal by the administration that we create this privatization of \nSocial Security. That is not a good starting point. We should be able \nto come together and agree on some facts. The facts are fairly obvious. \nThey have been certified by the General Accounting Office and the \nCongressional Budget Office. They differ a little bit from what was \njust said.\n  I was in Congress in 1983. We looked at Social Security and said we \nhave a serious, immediate crisis: If we do not do something, and do it \nnow, we will find ourselves in a position where we will not be able to \nmeet our promises to all the retirees who paid into Social Security \ntheir entire working lives.\n  President Ronald Reagan, a Republican President, reached across the \naisle to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Tip O'Neill, a \nleading Democrat, and said: Can't we find a bipartisan way to deal with \nthe most popular and important social program in America? Tip O'Neill \nsaid: We have to.\n  They created a commission with Alan Greenspan as the Chairman. They \nbrought real bipartisanship to the Commission. They did not try to load \nit one way or the other which, unfortunately, has happened many times \nwhen it comes to Social Security. This Commission came up with a list \nof suggestions to Congress. They said: If you do these things, Social \nSecurity will have a long life. The baby boomers whom we know will \nretire after the turn of this century, we will be able to take care of \nthem.\n  Some of the things they proposed were controversial: One, increase \nthe retirement age to the age of 67 over a period of years; there were \nsuggestions of taxing Social Security benefits for higher income \nretirees; there were cuts in benefits; there were increases in payroll \ntaxes. It was a long list, but each of the proposals in and of itself \nwas not that extreme or radical. When it was all said and done, on a \nbipartisan basis, Congress enacted that law, changed Social Security.\n  Let me tell you what we bought for the political courage of President \nRonald Reagan and Speaker Tip O'Neill in 1983. What we bought was, \nliterally, 59 years of solvency for Social Security. We came together \nand solved the problem.\n  There are people ever since who have been carping about and \ncriticizing the 1983 bipartisan approach, but I am glad I voted for it. \nI am glad because I can stand and face those retiring and say we faced \nthe problem and we solved the problem.\n  Frankly, that is what we have to acknowledge today. The future \nproblems are, in fact, long-term future problems for Social Security. \nWhat we know now is obvious and has been certified and found to be \ntrue; that is, untouched, unchanged, without a single amendment to the \nSocial Security law, no changes whatsoever, Social Security will make \nevery payment to every retiree, with a cost-of-living adjustment, every \nmonth, every year, until 2042--according to the Congressional Budget \nOffice, 2052. So for 37 years, Social Security is intact, solid, \nperforming, and solvent. Some say it is beyond that. Some say at the \nend of 47 years we will reach a point where we will not be able to meet \nevery obligation.\n  Think of that. There is not a single program in our Federal \nGovernment today that we can say with any degree of certainty will be \nhere 3 years from now. We can say with certainty, under the current \nlaw, Social Security will be there 37 years from now making \nevery single promised payment.\n\n  What happens after 37 years? It is true, we will have taken the \nsurplus in Social Security and spent it down. And then we look at the \nreceipts coming in and the interest earned and some estimate we can \nonly pay 70 to 80 percent of our Social Security obligation. Now that \nis a challenge. How do we make up the difference? How do we make up the \ndifference of the 20 to 30 percent that needs to be made up in Social \nSecurity? It is a problem that could be 40 years away. Today, if we sat \ndown and made bipartisan, commonsense suggestions for changes in Social \nSecurity, much as we did in 1983, we can come up with a reasonable \nsolution. Instead, what has the administration proposed? The President \nhas come forward and said: We have to change Social Security as you \nknow it. The program that has served America for almost 70 years, this \nprogram, we should change dramatically.\n  So we asked the President, What do you have in mind? He says people \nshould be able to take part of the money they are currently putting \ninto payroll taxes and put it into private or personal accounts. That \nis appealing to some people because they think they would rather invest \nit in a mutual fund because they think they can make more money than \nthe Social Security Administration can make. Other people say, well, \nwhat if you invest it in the mutual fund and it does not make as much \nmoney as in Social Security? Isn't there a risk involved?\n  There certainly is.\n  And then there are equally important questions. If you are going to \ntake this money out of Social Security that was supposed to go toward \npaying current retirees, who will make up the difference? The President \ndoes not answer the question. The budget of the President does not \nanswer the question. And in comes a memo from the White House which \nprojects one of their solutions to Social Security is to change the way \nbenefits are calculated. Currently, the formula is based on a wage \nindex. It is based on the increase in wages. The White House memo says \nwe ought to base it on the prices index, the increases in the cost of \nliving. It does not sound like much, but it is a substantial change.\n  As we play out this White House suggestion, what we find is alarming. \nWhat the White House memo proposed would lead to a 40-percent decrease \nin Social Security benefits. So we step back and say, wait a minute. If \nwe do nothing in the year 2042 we can see a 20- to 30-percent decrease \nin our payments in Social Security. But if we buy into the President's \napproach we know we will see a 40-percent decrease. How can that be a \ngood solution? The President's plan does not make Social Security any \nstronger. The President's plan makes Social Security even weaker.\n  Then there is the kicker, the one thing that the administration does \nnot want to talk about. This administration says their budget is \nfocused on taming the budget deficit. I have to tell the President \nquite honestly, if you do not include in your budget the cost of the \nIraq war, and you do not include in your budget the cost of privatizing \nSocial Security, it is not complete, it is not an honest budget. We \nknow in a period of the first 10 years we could have anywhere from $750 \nbillion to $2 trillion added to our national debt. So you say to the \nPresident, How are you going do make up that difference, that you will \ntake the money out of Social Security for private accounts and create \nthat additional national debt? How are you going to pay for that?\n  Well, we will add it to the debt of America. For all the young \npeople, the\n\n[[Page S1223]]\n\npages that have been referred to in the Senate who are now becoming the \nobject of many of our speeches, I don't think we are doing any favors \nby creating private accounts and saying, incidentally, here is a $2 \ntrillion debt, a little mortgage for you to consider. Do not forget \nabout your student loans and getting married and buying that first car \nand buying that home; here is a little debt from Uncle Sam that is part \nof the President's proposal.\n  When I listen to the President's privatization approach, I have to \nsay there are several aspects that trouble me. First, this is not a \ncrisis. We are not going to be in dire emergency circumstances in 2008. \nAccording to the Congressional Budget Office, almost 50 years from now \nSocial Security is solvent. Social Security is making every single \npayment. Yes, we have a challenge beyond that. Secondly, the \nPresident's plan does not make Social Security stronger, it makes it \nweaker. And third, if this is such an obvious answer, why won't the \nPresident include this in his budget? You cannot take a plan seriously \nif the President does not put it in his budget.\n\n  I will yield to the Senator from Utah for a question.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, the Senator from Illinois began by \nsaying that the facts were different than those I had outlined. I would \nask him to tell me where my facts are wrong. He referred to the GAO and \nthe CBO, all of which are fully aware of the facts I quoted, and all of \nwhich, to my understanding, endorsed the facts I quoted. So I would \nlike to know where factually I was in error.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Utah. I am afraid I did not hear \nhis exact words, but he referred to the year 2008 as being a critical \nyear.\n  Mr. BENNETT. That is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. As I understand it, we are currently collecting more from \nour workers across America for Social Security than we currently need \nto pay out to retirees. This has been the case since the mid-1980s \nbecause we saw this big tsunami of the baby boom generation coming at \nSocial Security. This year, we may be collecting as much as twice the \namount we need to pay the Social Security retirees, building up this \nsurplus.\n  So to suggest we have this terrible situation today where we cannot \nmeet the obligations of Social Security, or that we are going to have \nit in 2008, or that we are going to have it in 2018 is wrong. By all of \nthe Government agencies mentioned by the Senator from Utah, we are \ngoing to make every single payment in Social Security for 37 years, \nmaybe 47 years. There is no crisis because we prepared for this. It is \nas if we understood in a family situation that we are not going to earn \nenough money in the outyears to make a go of it, so we save money and \ntake it from our savings account for those lean years. That is what we \nare doing for Social Security.\n  To suggest this is a crisis we did not anticipate, I was here when we \ndid anticipate it. President Reagan and Tip O'Neill, in anticipation of \nit, came up with a good, bipartisan approach.\n  I yield to the Senator from Utah for another question.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, is the Senator from Illinois aware of \nthe fact that the Comptroller General of the United States, who runs \nGAO, has used the 2008 figure because the 2008 date is the date the \nbaby boomers start to retire? Is the Senator from Illinois aware of the \nfact that I did not say there is a looming crisis that hits us in 2008, \nthat what I said was the pressure on the Social Security system will \nbegin in 2008 and will build from that date to the point that \nultimately $1.5 trillion will have to be raised to fill in the hole in \nthe trust fund, once we cross the line where the amount coming in does \nnot meet the amount going out, and that the 2008 figure is the \nbeginning of the crisis? By no means did I imply or state that 2008 was \nindeed a crisis point.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, reclaiming my time, let me concede to \nthe Senator from Utah, if I misstated his position, I apologize. I do \nwant to make it clear, though, that I sincerely disagree with your \nconclusion. To suggest we are facing a crisis in 2008 is to suggest we \ndid not anticipate what will happen in 2008, and that is plain wrong.\n  In 1983, we anticipated the baby boomer generation, larger numbers of \nretirees, and we did something about it because we made changes in the \nlaw. Because we are prepared for the baby boomers, we will not be in \ncrisis in 2008. We will have the money to pay every single baby boomer \nevery penny promised.\n  That is the point many on the other side of the aisle want to \noverlook. They want to overlook what we did in 1983. Instead, they \nshould look to that as a model for what we should do in 2005.\n  If we want to do something for Social Security, let's do it on a \nbipartisan basis.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, will the Senator from Illinois yield \nfor a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, before I yield, I would ask the \nPresiding Officer, how much time is remaining in morning business on \nour side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 15 minutes 45 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I will make a statement that will take \nabout 7 or 8 minutes on Medicare prescription drugs. Then I will yield \nthe remainder of the time to the Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, that would be great. Can I ask the \nSenator to yield for one question on Social Security?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield to the Senator for one question.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I listened carefully to the discussion \nof the Senator from Illinois on Social Security, and I am curious, \nbecause I heard the President say if you are 55 or older you are fine, \nyou will be OK under his new plan. He is targeting it to everybody \nelse. But as I listened to the Senator talk about the fact that money \nwould be taken out of the payroll tax, and we also would be increasing \nthe debt by substantial amounts, do you think someone who is 55 today \nis going to be OK under this plan 10 years from now when they retire \nand money has been taken out of the payroll tax?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, in response to the question of the \nSenator from Washington, I obviously cannot answer that because no one \nknows what this privatization plan would do exactly. It certainly is \nnot healthy for the Social Security system to see payroll taxes that \nhad been anticipated and dedicated to paying retirees being removed and \nput into private investments with the risk attached to them. So I do \nnot think there is any certainty for any retiree if the President \ncannot come up with more details on what he plans to do. I, for one, \nthink the President's plan weakens Social Security and does not \nstrengthen it.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Durbin and Mrs. Murray pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 341 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements \non Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, one week ago we walked across the \nCapitol to hear President Bush outline his priorities for the Nation \nwhen he issued his State of the Union Address. On that night, President \nBush told all of us and the Nation that the document reflecting his \npriorities, his fiscal year 2006 budget, `` . . . substantially reduces \nor eliminates more the than 150 government programs that are not \ngetting results, or duplicate current efforts, or do not fulfill \nessential priorities.''\n  Less than a week after delivering that address, the President \nunveiled his budget that defines exactly what he sees as those \nnonessential priorities. What are they? Students; our ports and our \nborders; accessible health care; nuclear waste cleanup.\n  In addition, his budget has not one dollar--that is right, not one \nsingle dollar--for the two top priorities the President talked about \nthat night. His two top priorities: Social Security transition, and \nmaking the tax cuts permanent. Both of those items are completely \nignored in his budget. This is a camouflage budget that we have been \npresented, and it is meant to hide the truth from American families.\n  What the President should know is that families in my home State of \nWashington and across the country are concerned about the security of \ntheir\n\n[[Page S1224]]\n\njobs, the security of their communities, access to affordable health \ncare, and quality education.\n  Unfortunately, rather than inspiring confidence, I believe the \nPresident's budget leaves too many Americans questioning the future. On \nissue after issue, this budget falls short of what our communities need \ntoday to move forward and to feel secure.\n  What I would like to focus on is this budget's impact on one group \nthat we absolutely must take care of, and that is our Nation's \nveterans. We have no greater obligation as elected officials than to \ntake care of those who have taken care of us. Unfortunately, I fear \nthis administration is failing in this most important responsibility. \nAfter asking thousands of soldiers to serve us overseas, this \nadministration is not making their health care and their well-being a \npriority when they cease being soldiers and become veterans.\n  Access to first-class care should be a reality for all veterans, \nespecially while our Nation is at war. The President's budget may have \na few small steps in the right direction, but, sadly, he does not go \nfar enough to meet the needs of all veterans. If this budget and its \nmisguided proposals were enacted, it would devastate veterans' health \ncare. Payroll and inflation increases for doctors, for nurses, for \nmedications cost more than $1 billion. But the President has proposed \nto give the VA only half what it needs. To make up for the shortfall, \nthe budget forces more than 2 million so-called middle-income veterans \nto pay more than double for their needed medications and to pay a $250 \nenrollment fee. That is not what we promised veterans when we asked \nthem to serve us overseas.\n  In addition, the President's budget actually continues to ban some \nveterans from coming to the VA for care. So far under this flawed \npolicy, 192,260 veterans have been turned away across the country, \nincluding more than 3,000 in my home State. This sends the wrong \nmessage to our troops overseas. They need to know we are there for them \nwhen they return home.\n  Sadly, this budget also destroys the relationship between the VA and \nour States. After the Civil War, the VA has supported the cost of \nveterans who reside in our State VA nursing homes. But this budget now \ncalls on States to cover the entire cost of care for many veterans in \nthese cost-effective nursing homes.\n  To make this budget add up, the President calls for $590 million in \nunspecified efficiencies. Thousands of nurses and other providers will \nbe cut, thousands of nursing home beds will be shuttered, and more than \n1 million veterans will no longer be able to afford to come to the VA \nfor care.\n  You don't have to take my word for this. Listen to the head of the \nVFW who addressed this issue in Commerce Daily a few days ago. John \nFurgess, who heads the Veterans of Foreign Wars, said the \nadministration's proposed $880 million increase in veterans health care \nonly amounts to an increase of about $100 million because the budget \nproposes that veterans shoulder a $250 enrollment fee and an increased \ncopay on prescription drugs in addition to nursing home cuts. Furgess \nsaid:\n\n       Part of the federal government's deficit will be balanced \n     on the backs of military veterans, because it's clear that \n     the proper funding of veterans' health care and other \n     programs is not an administration priority.\n\n  There is more. Before the budget was even sent to Congress, I read \nthis in the New York Times:\n\n       Richard B. Fuller, legislative director of the Paralyzed \n     Veterans of America, said: ``The proposed increase in health \n     spending is not sufficient at a time when the number of \n     patients is increasing and there has been a huge increase in \n     health care costs. It will not cover the need. The enrollment \n     fee is a health care tax, designed to raise revenue and to \n     discourage people from enrolling.''\n\n  Mr. Fuller added that the budget would force veterans, hospitals, and \nclinics to limit services. He said:\n\n       We are already seeing an increase in waiting lists, even \n     for some Iraq veterans.\n\n  The story went on to say that there are already some hospitals with \nwaiting lists for Iraqi veterans:\n\n       In Michigan, for example, thousands of veterans are on \n     waiting lists for medical services, and some reservists \n     returning from Iraq say they have been unable to obtain the \n     care they were promised. A veterans clinic in Pontiac, Mich., \n     put a limit on new enrollment. Cutbacks at a veterans \n     hospital in Altoona, Pa., are forcing some veterans to seek \n     treatment elsewhere.\n\n  And yesterday, in an editorial titled ``Penalizing Veterans,'' the \nBoston Globe said:\n\n       It is a sign of how desperate the Bush administration is to \n     protect tax cuts for the wealthy while also trying to reduce \n     runaway deficits that it would call for veterans to pay more \n     for their health benefits. Congress should reject this \n     proposal out of hand and put enough money into veterans' \n     health care to end the inexcusable waiting lists at many \n     veterans' facilities.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the editorial in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Boston Globe, Feb. 9, 2005]\n\n                          Penalizing Veterans\n\n       It is a sign of how desperate the Bush administration is to \n     protect tax cuts for the wealthy while also trying to reduce \n     runaway deficits that it would call for veterans to pay more \n     for their health benefits. Congress should reject this \n     proposal out of hand and put enough money into veterans' \n     health care to end the inexcusable waiting lists at many \n     veterans' facilities.\n       Under the Bush proposal, veterans would have to pay an \n     enrollment fee of $250 for VA care. Their copay for \n     prescription drugs would rise from $7 to $15 for a monthly \n     prescription. The administration lamely defends these charges \n     by noting that they are for ``higher-income'' veterans \n     without service-connected disabilities. According to Joe \n     March of the American Legion, the administration defines \n     ``higher income'' as $25,000 or more, which hardly qualifies \n     as the Boca Raton set. A VA spokesman said the income level \n     is based on local conditions. He could not provide a national \n     average.\n       The goal of the administration, which has made similar \n     proposals in the past, is to save close to a half-billion \n     dollars by coaxing more than 200,000 veterans to seek care in \n     other venues. But increasing numbers of older Americans have \n     been turning to VA clinics and hospitals because they have \n     lost their employment-based insurance and discovered that \n     Medicare will not start covering prescription drug costs \n     until 2006. Many of these veterans do not have affordable \n     alternatives. According to Representative Stephen Lynch of \n     South Boston, veterans in his district often have to wait \n     eight months to see a doctor.\n       Treatment of veterans without service-related disabilities \n     is considered ``discretionary'' spending by the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs. Veterans'' advocates think this care should \n     not be discretionary but mandatory, like Medicare. In spite \n     of the growing number of veterans from recent wars, the \n     increasingly severe health needs of older veterans, and \n     overall increases in health costs, the administration is \n     asking for just a 2.7 percent increase for ``discretionary'' \n     health care. Veterans groups favor an increase of 25 percent.\n       That is not realistic, but it is a reflection of the \n     frustration the advocates feel knowing that inadequate \n     spending for veterans' health is undermining the unwritten \n     promise of lifetime care that many veterans believe was made \n     to them when they took the oath.\n       ``Veterans' health care is an ongoing expense of war,'' the \n     American Legion's national commander, Thomas Cadmus, said \n     yesterday. It is particularly wrong-headed for the \n     administration to squeeze veterans when some of the armed \n     services have had trouble filling their ranks. Congress \n     should tell the Bush administration that veterans, who \n     enlisted to help their nation, should not be enlisted anew, \n     involuntarily, and burdened with the job of balancing the \n     budget.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. As my colleagues can see, I am not alone in my concern \nfor this budget's tremendous impact on our veterans. Unfortunately, the \nwidespread outrage at this budget is not limited to its impact on \nveterans. I could speak for much time on this floor about my concern \nabout the other priorities our country faces--health care, education, \nand nuclear waste cleanup.\n  As a member of the Budget Committee, I raised some of these concerns \nyesterday with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. I \nwas pretty disappointed with OMB Director Bolten's responses to our \nquestions on energy policy, on veterans, and on a number of other \nissues that came before the Budget Committee. This morning, Secretary \nSnow is addressing the committee. I will leave the floor now to attend \nthat hearing. I hope we get better responses from him.\n  But for now, let me just say that it seems to me that President Bush \nbelieves that in his budget veterans are a nonessential priority. That \nis an insult. It is an insult to them, to their service, and their \nsacrifice. I know I, along with many of my colleagues, will not stand \nfor this assault on our veterans. They deserve better.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S1225]]\n\n  Mr. McCAIN.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of S. 5, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 5) to amend the procedures that apply to the \n     consideration of interstate class actions to assure fairer \n     outcomes for class members and defendants, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Durbin (Modified) Amendment No. 3, to preserve State court \n     procedures for handling mass actions.\n       Feingold Amendment No. 12, to establish time limits for \n     action by Federal district courts on motions to remand cases \n     that have been removed to Federal court.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank Senators on both sides of the \naisle for their cooperation in moving this class action bill. We \nreported it out of committee a week ago today and started the opening \ndebate on it on Monday afternoon and then proceeded in a very timely \nfashion. The prospects are good that we will conclude action on the \nbill today. A unanimous consent agreement is currently in the process \nof being worked out, and we will know in the next few minutes precisely \nwhat will happen.\n  We are going to proceed in a few minutes to the amendment offered by \nthe Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. Feingold, which would impose some time \nlimits on the courts which, as I said at the committee hearing last \nweek, I think is a good idea. I advised Senator Feingold that I would \nfeel constrained to oppose it on this bill because of the procedural \nstatus, where the House of Representatives has been reported to accept \nthe Senate bill provided it comes over as what we call a clean bill, \nwithout amendments.\n  But as I said to Senator Feingold, and will repeat for the record, I \nhad heard many complaints about delays in our Federal judicial system. \nI believe that is an appropriate subject for inquiry by the Judiciary \nCommittee on a broader range than the issue specifically proposed by \nSenator Feingold. It is in the same family.\n  I want to be emphatic. We are not impinging in any way on the \nindependence of the Federal judiciary, their discretionary judgments. \nBut when it comes to time limits, how long they have these matters \nunder advisement, I think that is an appropriate matter for \ncongressional inquiry. It bears on how many judges we need and what \nought to be done with our judicial system generally. So that will be a \nsubject taken up by the Judiciary Committee at a later date.\n  I think the Senate bill--this may be a little parochial pride--is \nmore in keeping with an equitable handling of class action bills than \nis the House bill. For example, the House bill would be retroactive and \napply to matters now pending in the State courts, which would be \nextraordinarily disruptive of many State court proceedings. I think it \nis fair and accurate to say that the House bill is more restrictive \nthan the Senate bill and our Senate bill, I think, is a better measure \nto achieve the targeted objective of having class actions decided in \nthe Federal court with balance for plaintiffs and for defendants as \nwell.\n  So we are moving, I think, by this afternoon, to have a bill which \nwill be ready for concurrence by the House, and signature by the \nPresident, and that I think will be a sign that we are moving forward \non the legislative calendar.\n  The Senator from Louisiana is going to seek recognition in a few \nminutes. I thank my distinguished colleague, Senator Hatch, the former \nchairman, who has agreed to come over and manage the bill during my \nabsence. We are, at the moment, having hearings on the bankruptcy bill \nwhich we hope to have in executive session next Thursday, to move ahead \non our fast moving, ambitious judiciary calendar.\n  I now yield to my distinguished colleague from Louisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of S. 5, the \nClass Action Fairness Act of 2005. In doing so, I wish to recognize and \nthank them for their leadership, so many Senators who have moved the \nbill thus far, certainly including the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee who just spoke, also the Senator from Iowa, the chief sponsor \nof the bill, and also the Senator from Utah, the former chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  I am also an original cosponsor of this bill, because it would \nprotect consumers from some of the most egregious abuses in our \njudicial system.\n  Let me begin by saying that class actions are an important part of \nour justice system. They serve an important purpose when properly \ndefined. No one would dispute they are a valuable feature of the legal \nsystem. This bill doesn't do away with them.\n  As stated so eloquently by the bill's chief sponsor, my colleague \nfrom Iowa, S. 5 is really court reform more than tort reform. What does \nit reform? What is the problem?\n  The reason we need to pass this bill is that there are loopholes in \nthe class action system, and it allows bad actors to game the system. \nAs a result, in recent years class actions have been subject to abuses \nthat actually work to the detriment of individual consumers, plaintiffs \nin such cases. That is exactly who the law is supposed to help.\n  Additionally, this gaming of the system clearly works to the \ndetriment of business and our economy, and the need for job creation in \nforging a strong economy.\n  Such abuses happen mainly in State and local courts in cases that \nreally ought to be heard in Federal court.\n  We currently have a system, therefore, which some trial lawyers \nseeking to game the system in an effort to maximize their fees seek out \nsome small jurisdiction to pursue nationwide cookie-cutter cases, and \nthey act against major players in a targeted industry. Often, these \nsuits have very little, if anything, to do with the place in which they \nare brought. Rather, lawyers select the venues for strategic reasons, \nor for political reasons, a practice known as forum shopping.\n  These trial lawyers seek out jurisdictions in which the judge will \nnot hesitate to approve settlements in which the lawyers walk away with \nhuge fees and the plaintiff class members often get next to nothing. \nThe judges in these jurisdictions will decide the claims of other State \ncitizens under their unique State law. They will use litigation models \nthat deny due process rights to consumers and defendants.\n  Often the decisions coming out of these hand-picked and carefully \nselected venues are huge windfalls for trial lawyers and big law firms \nand a punch line for consumers and the people the lawyers claim to \nrepresent. There is now in our country a full blown effort aimed at \nmining for jackpots in sympathetic courts known as ``magnet courts'' \nfor the favorable way they treat these cases.\n  Let us look at a few examples of exactly what I am talking about. \nPerhaps the best example nationwide, in terms of preferred venues for \ntrial lawyers, is Madison County, IL, where class action filings \nbetween 1998 and 2000 increased nearly 2,000 percent. There is actually \nan example of a South Carolina law firm filing a purported class action \non behalf of three named plaintiffs. None of them lived in Madison \nCounty, IL, but the lawsuit was filed in that jurisdiction against 31 \ndefendants throughout the United States. None of those defendants were \nlocated in Madison County. These lawyers based the alleged jurisdiction \non the mere allegation that some as yet unknown class\n\n[[Page S1226]]\n\nmember might happen to live in Madison County.\n\n  I have a law degree. That is stunning to me. You can imagine how \nastounding and silly and ridiculous that seems to the American people, \nsmall business owners, and consumers around the country. So Madison \nCounty is a great example of one of these magnet jurisdictions. Once \ntheir reputation as a magnet jurisdiction is established, they attract \nmajor nationwide lawsuits that deal with interstate commerce--exactly \nthe types of lawsuits that should be decided in the Federal court.\n  As noted in one study:\n\n       Virtually every sector of the United States economy is on \n     trial in Madison County, Palm Beach County, FL, and Jefferson \n     County, TX--long distance carriers, gasoline purchasers, \n     insurance companies, computer manufacturers and \n     pharmaceutical developers.\n\n  Let us review some of the outrageous decisions that this gaming of a \nbroken system produces.\n  The Bank of Boston case, where class action members actually lost \nmoney when their accounts were debited to pay their lawyers $8.5 \nmillion; the Blockbuster settlement, where the class action members \nreceived coupons off their next rentals while their lawyers were paid \n$9.25 million; and, the Cheerios case where the plaintiffs got coupons \nfor cereal, while the lawyers reaped $1.75 million--coupons that, quite \nfrankly, they could have gotten in the Sunday local newspaper.\n  Sad to say, this is hitting home in my home State of Louisiana as \nwell, because one of the jurisdictions that is appearing more and more \non the list of these magnet jurisdictions is in Louisiana, Orleans \nParish, the city of New Orleans.\n  I have mentioned how this gaming of the system is a huge disservice \nso many times to the consumers that were allegedly harmed. They get \ncoupons or next to nothing. In one case, they had to pay even after the \naward. It is also a huge cost to business and a huge drain on the \nAmerican economy.\n  Small businesses are already spending, on average, $150,000 annually \non legal fees. The tort system costs U.S. small business $88 billion \nper year. This is all money that could be used to hire new employees or \nto improve benefits. I have long been concerned that Louisiana is \nincreasingly becoming a part of this trend.\n  I mentioned a minute ago Orleans Parish, which is clearly showing up \nmore and more on the list of these magnet jurisdictions. This is bad \nfor our Louisiana efforts at job creation. It is a serious negative for \ncompanies looking to locate in our State.\n  I will quote from an amicus brief filed at the Louisiana Supreme \nCourt in the case of Sutton Steel and Supply, Inc., Kate Davis, and \nMestayer and Mestayer, APLC v. Bellsouth Mobility, Inc. In that brief, \nthey said:\n\n       In a recent poll of more than 1,400 in-house general \n     counsel and other senior litigators at public corporations . \n     . . Louisiana was ranked 46th for its treatment of class \n     actions, out of the 48 States that permit class action suits \n     in their courts.\n\n  The study they cited is the Chamber of Commerce study done in March \n2004, and the amicus brief continues:\n\n       Importantly, 80 percent of the respondents--these are \n     businesses now, job creators--indicated that they perceive \n     fairness of the litigation environment in a State ``could \n     affect important business decisions at their company, such as \n     where to locate or do business'' and with good reason.\n\n  Of course, many small businesses are dragged down by what are known \nas Yellow Page lawsuits. In these cases, hundreds of defendants are \nnamed in a lawsuit, and it is their responsibility to prove they are \nnot culpable. In many cases, plaintiffs named defendants using vendor \nlists, or even lists literally from the Yellow Pages of certain types \nof businesses, be they auto supply stores, drugstores, what have you, \nin a particular jurisdiction.\n  Imagine what this means to your State's job creation efforts when \nnational attention is brought to your local jurisdiction because it is \na new magnet jurisdiction--a new Madison County, IL. The only jobs that \nyou will be creating are legal positions for the flyby lawsuit filed by \nout-of-Staters hoping for a payoff from your local industries and \ncompanies.\n  I have identified the problem, gaming a broken system. We have \nidentified the real and negative results of that problem, hurting the \nactual consumers who are supposed to be helped, and costing business \nand job creation in your State, including my home State of Louisiana, \nenormous amounts, including in terms of jobs not created or lost jobs.\n  Why is S. 5 the solution?\n  I believe S. 5 is a careful, reasonable, and moderate response to the \nproblem with our class action system. We have a bipartisan compromise \nthat has been in the making for 6 years: 6 years of negotiation, \ncareful study, and careful compromise. It deserves our support.\n\n  The House of Representatives has already passed similar class action \nreform legislation more than once. I have personally supported and \nworked for that, and voted for that when I served in the House.\n  S. 5 provides for Federal district court jurisdiction for interstate \nclass action, specifically those in which the aggregate amount in \ncontroversy exceeds $5 million and any member of a plaintiff class is a \ncitizen of a different State from any defendant. Under the bill, \ncertain class actions with more than 100 plaintiffs also would be \ntreated as class actions and subject to Federal jurisdiction.\n  The bill provides exceptions for cases in which Federal jurisdiction \nis not warranted. Under the so-called home State exception and the \nlocal controversy exception, class action cases will remain in State \ncourts if there is significant connection to a local issue or event or \na significant number of plaintiffs are from a single State.\n  The bill includes consumer protections so the real little guy, the \nplaintiff, the consumer who is wronged, is truly made whole. The bill's \nconsumer bill of rights would require, among other things, that judges \nreview all coupon settlements and limit attorney's fees paid in such \nsettlements to the value actually received by class members. It would \nalso require judges to carefully scrutinize net law settlements in \nwhich the class action members end up losing money in a class action \nsettlement, and would prohibit settlements in which parochial judges \nallow some class action members to have a larger recovery because they \nsimply live closer to the courthouse.\n  I am pleased there is bipartisan, bicameral support for a carefully \ncrafted, well-thought-out measure. S. 5 is long overdue.\n  It is also important to say what we are not doing. This bill is not \nan attempt to eliminate class action lawsuits. Time and again, it has \nbeen said by parties on all sides that class actions have a proper \nplace in the legal system. This bill is a modest effort to swing the \npendulum back toward common sense, making the system work as it was \nintended.\n  This bill will not move all class actions to Federal court, only the \nones most appropriately settled there. This bill will not overload \nFederal courts with class actions. They are prepared to deal with these \ncases far better than State courts, many of whom are overburdened now. \nWe are also not delaying justice for plaintiffs. Federal courts have as \ngood or better records of dealing with class actions in a timely \nmanner.\n  In closing, our class action system is rife with abuses. It is gamed. \nIt is broken. We need to fix it. First, we need to fix it for the \nconsumers who are hurt by alleged abuses which are the subject of this \nclass action litigation. Plaintiffs leave feeling cheated because they \nreceive a token settlement in many cases for their efforts while \nlawyers reap all of the financial benefits.\n  Second, the system is broken and we need to fix it so we do not hurt \nlegitimate business, legitimate job-creation efforts in Louisiana and \nelsewhere. Right now, businesses, fearing the mere threat of legal \naction, settle cases--a form of judicial blackmail. The whole economy \nis dragged down and fewer jobs are created as a result.\n  Third, our system of federalism is undermined today because one \nState's legal system, rather than the legal system of the Federal \nbranch of the courts, is making decisions that affect many or even all \nother States. So the system is not working for anyone but the lawyers \nand law firms gaming that system.\n  A lot of good, hard work has been put into S. 5. I compliment again \nthe prime sponsor, Senator Grassley, as well as the Judiciary \nCommittee, led by the Senator from Pennsylvania. I compliment all of \ntheir leadership and\n\n[[Page S1227]]\n\ntheir respective staff members for their efforts. I am proud to be a \ncosponsor of S. 5. I urge my colleagues to support and vote for the \nClass Action Fairness Act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today is going to be an important day for \nthe American public because the Senate will adopt legislation that \ntakes a significant step forward in improving our Nation's civil \njustice system. I commend my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for \ncoming together on this very important bipartisan bill. Our work in \nthis body bodes well for the Senate's ability to tackle important \nissues in the 109th Congress.\n  Let me now take a couple of minutes to address the pending amendment, \nSenator Feingold's amendment, that would add a provision to S. 5 \nrequiring Federal courts to consider remand motions in class actions \nwithin a specified period. This amendment is based on the questionable \npremise that Federal courts move too slowly and consumer claims will \nstall while plaintiffs are waiting for courts to rule on jurisdictional \nissues.\n  In fact, in many cases, Federal courts move more quickly than the \nState courts. Resolving remand motions is always their first course of \nbusiness, and we are moving these cases to Federal courts.\n  The amendment also fails to recognize the important considerations a \njudge must make as part of a remand decision. Like other amendments \nthat have been offered, this proposal would result in a less workable \nbill, not a better one. This amendment should be rejected.\n  The fact is, the Federal courts do not drag their feet in dealing \nwith remand motions. Federal courts always consider jurisdictional \nissues first, as they must, before allowing discovery or other \nsubstantive motions. The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that \njurisdiction is a threshold matter that must be decided prior to other \nsubstantive issues in a case. Courts take up jurisdiction as the first \ncourse of business already. The amendment is, therefore, unnecessary.\n  I also want to correct the misunderstanding that Federal courts drag \ntheir feet in dealing with class actions generally. This is not the \ncase. In fact, Federal courts generally move more quickly than State \ncourts when it comes to class actions. A recent 2004 study by the \nFederal Judicial Center found that State courts are far more likely \nthan Federal courts to let class actions linger without ruling on class \ncertification. Moreover, the median time for final disposition of a \ncivil claim filed in Federal court throughout this country is 9.3 \nmonths; the median time to trial in a civil matter in State court is \n22.5 months. Let me repeat that: 9.3 months in Federal courts versus \n22.5 months in State courts for civil claims to be disposed. The dates \nshowing the Federal courts act more than twice as fast as State courts \ncome from the nonpartisan Administrative Office of the United States \nCourts. There is simply no evidence that States proceed more quickly. \nThus, the alleged problem that this amendment would fix is nonexistent. \nIt does not exist.\n  Take, for example, the case cited by Senator Feingold yesterday, \nLizana v. DuPont. It did take a year to rule on the motion to remand, \nbut it is my understanding that the court's docket reveals at the time \nthe court was considering the motion, there were numerous briefings and \nmotions on both sides and numerous hearings to determine whether to \nremand. The court was hardly sitting on its hands. If anything, this \ncase shows that the courts may require more than 180 days to make a \ncorrect decision. They were moving, and moving ahead, and moving ahead \nwith dispatch. But it was a complicated case and it took a little \nlonger. It may very well take more than 180 days, and in some cases, it \ncertainly will.\n  Another case cited in support of the amendment was Gipson v. Sprint. \nBut when you look at the facts, the facts do not show much support for \nthe amendment at all. Again, it is my understanding the docket reveals \nthat the court was very busy on the case before the ruling on the \nmotion to remand was even handed down. In fact, one of the motions the \ncourt was contending with was a motion for continuance filed by, you \nguessed it, plaintiffs' counsel. This means it was the plaintiffs who \nwanted the court to delay its ruling. How can anyone complain about the \ntime it takes for a district court not to rule on a remand motion when \nthere are scores of docket entries in a single year and the plaintiffs \nthemselves were seeking delays?\n  Some opposed to this amendment suggested that defendants will use \nremoval as a delay tactic, but Federal law already penalizes defendants \nwho engage in such tactics. The Federal law governing removal gives \njudges discretion to make a defendant pay the plaintiff's attorney's \nfees if remand is granted. In addition, rule 11 of the Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure gives Federal judges the authority to levy sanctions \nfor frivolous filings. Thus, the law already addresses concerns about \nimprovident removals.\n  The bottom line is that this amendment will make it unnecessarily \ndifficult for judges to issue fair rulings in these more complicated \ncases. And class actions generally are more complicated cases. By \nforcing judges to decide remand motions by a certain date, as the \nFeingold amendment would do, that amendment fails to recognize that in \nsome cases the jurisdictional issues will be complex, requiring \ndiscovery, substantial briefing, and hearings before the judge.\n  At times, courts consider several remand motions jointly in order to \nconserve judicial resources, such as in multidistrict litigation, or \nMDL, as it is called, and this may, in a limited number of complex \ncases, result in a slightly longer time period for resolution as well. \nForcing judges to rush these issues in all cases regardless of their \ncomplexity could result in a denial of due process in these cases where \nthe judge cannot fully comprehend and resolve the issue, or issues, in \nthe time allotted by the Feingold amendment.\n  The reality is that most remand motions will be decided in less time \nthan the amendment requires, but in some cases they will require more \ntime. We should not create rules of law that force judges to decide \nissues without full and fair consideration. And that is exactly what \nthe Feingold amendment would do.\n  Finally, there is a reason the time limits make sense for remand \nappeals and not for initial rulings on remand motions. In contrast to \ndistrict courts, which often must develop a factual record to address \nremand issues, an appeals court that is asked to review a remand order \nwill be provided with a full record from which to reach a decision. \nOften, the appeals court's decision will be based simply on a reading \nof the law, and it will, thus, be less time-consuming than the district \ncourt's decision.\n  Even a 180-day time limit may be too stringent in some circumstances. \nExtending it to district court judges will make it more difficult for \nthem, in some cases, to do their jobs in a fair and efficient fashion.\n  So I hope our colleagues will vote down the Feingold amendment. \nFrankly, it is another poison pill amendment that would probably \nscuttle this bill for another year. We have already been on this bill \nfor 6 solid years. We have a consensus in this body to pass it. We know \nif we pass it in the form that it is in, the House will take it. We \nknow it will become law because the President will sign it into law. \nFrankly, I hope this amendment will be voted down for all of those \nreasons.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I would like to talk more generally about \nthe Class Action Fairness Act because it responds to a serious abuse of \nthe class action system that is on the rise; namely, the filing of \ncopycat or duplicative lawsuits in State courts.\n  Over the past several years, we have seen a rise in the number of \nclass action lawsuits filed in a few State courts known for tilting the \nplaying field in favor of the plaintiffs' bar; in other words, \ndishonestly, basically, getting the courts to not do justice. These \ncourts, referred to as ``magnet courts'' for their attractive qualities \nto enterprising plaintiffs' lawyers, certify class\n\n[[Page S1228]]\n\nactions with little regard to defendants' due process rights. They \naward substantial attorneys' fees as part of class settlements, and \nthey approve coupon settlements to the class members that are sometimes \nworth little more than the paper on which they are printed.\n  It has not taken the plaintiffs' lawyers long to figure out which \ncourts are good for their bank accounts. There was an 82-percent \nincrease in the number of class actions filed in Jefferson County, TX, \nbetween the years of 1998 and 2000. During the same time span, Palm \nBeach County, FL, saw a 35-percent increase. The most dramatic \nincrease, however, has occurred in Madison County, IL. Madison County \nhas seen an astonishing 5,000-percent increase in the number of class \naction filings since 1998.\n  Let me just refer to this bar chart. It shows that the number of \nclass actions filed in State courts has skyrocketed under current law: \nPalm Beach County, 35 percent in just 2 years or 3 years; Jefferson \nCounty, 82 percent in the same 2 or 3 years; and Madison County, over \n5,000 percent. And then this chart shows the overall increase in State \ncourts: 1,315-percent growth.\n  Now, in their effort to gain a financial windfall in class action \ncases, some aggressive plaintiffs' lawyers file copycat class action \nlawsuits. This tactic helps explain the dramatic increase in filings in \nthese magnet courts. Here is how the copycat class action strategy \nworks: Competing groups of plaintiffs' lawyers, and sometimes even the \nsame lawyers, file nearly identical class action lawsuits asserting \nsimilar claims on behalf of essentially the same class in State courts \naround the country. Some lawyers file duplicative actions in an effort \nto take a potentially lucrative role in an action. Other times, these \nduplicative actions are the product of forum shopping by the original \nlawyers who file similar actions in different State courts around the \ncountry, perhaps with the sole purpose of finding a friendly judge \nwilling to certify the class.\n  Because these duplicative actions are filed in State courts of \ndifferent jurisdictions, there is no way to consolidate or coordinate \nthese cases. As a result of the separate, redundant litigation of \ncopycat lawsuits, our already overburdened State courts can become \nclogged with complicated class actions that potentially affect the \nrights and recoveries of class members throughout the entire country.\n  There is not a single magnet State court in this country that has not \nencountered the copycat phenomenon. For example, it is my understanding \nthat in Shields v. Allstate County Mutual Insurance Company, filed in \nJefferson County, TX, in the year 2000, three named plaintiffs sought \ncertification of a nationwide class comprised of members who were \ninsured by three insurance companies. At the very same time this action \nwas brought in Jefferson County, no fewer than nine similar actions, \nrepresenting a similarly situated class and alleging the identical \nclaims, were pending in Madison County, IL, against the same insurance \ncompanies.\n  Another example of copycat lawsuits is Flanagan v. Bridgestone/\nFirestone, filed in Palm Beach County, FL. Now, this lawsuit was but \none of the approximately 100 identical class actions filed in State \ncourts throughout the country in the wake of the Ford/Firestone tire \nrecall in the year 2000.\n\n  One of the most obvious problems with copycat lawsuits is that they \nplace new burdens on an already stressed State court system. Class \nactions are large, complex lawsuits with potential ramifications in \njurisdictions across the country. Our State courts are courts of \ngeneral jurisdiction that deal with issues ranging from domestic \ndisputes to routine traffic offenses. They are simply not the best \nentity to handle the growing number of these complex lawsuits being \nfiled across the country where multiple parties and multiple issues are \ninvolved.\n  S. 5 will mitigate the growing burden on our State courts by \nproviding a means through which truly national class actions will be \nresolved in the most appropriate forum; that is, the Federal courts.\n  Over the past several months, I have heard some opponents of this \nbill argue that the Class Action Fairness Act will somehow result in a \ndelay or even a denial of justice to consumers. They have argued that \nState courts resolve claims more quickly, and that removing these \nactions will result in the overburdening of our Federal courts. I have \nyet to see or hear a single shred of persuasive evidence to support \nthese claims. In fact, according to the data, a strong case in the \nopposite direction can be made. According to two separate examinations \nof the State and Federal court systems conducted by the Court \nStatistics Project and Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, the \naverage State court judge is assigned nearly three times--nearly three \ntimes--as many cases as a Federal court judge. The increase of State \ncourt class actions further compounds this burden and interferes with \nthe ability of the State court judges to provide justice to their \ncitizens.\n  In fact, the Illinois Supreme Court has repeatedly criticized its own \nMadison County, IL, State court for its horrible backlog. The backlog \nis the result of the local court's willingness to take on cases that \nhave nothing to do with Madison County, the county in which they sit. \nIn fact, one Madison County State court judge expressed his willingness \nto take on cases that have little or no connection to Madison County, \nor even Illinois, for that matter, when he stated:\n\n       I am going to expand the concept that all courts in the \n     United States are for all citizens of the United States. . . \n     .\n\n  The fact is, when cases are accepted that have nothing to do with the \nState in which they are filed, it is difficult to see how justice is \nserved. When the cases are forced to remain in State court because some \nplaintiff's lawyers have exploited the system by engineering the \ncomposition of the class and the defendants, both the class members and \nthe defendants can easily be deprived of justice. In some cases, it \nappears that the interests disproportionately served are those of the \nclass counsel who stand to receive millions in attorney's fees upon the \nswift approval of a proposed settlement while their clients receive \nnext to nothing.\n  Despite claims to the contrary, S. 5 will not flood or remove all \nclass actions to Federal court. Instead the bill acts to decrease the \nnumber currently falling in State court dockets. Most of the cases that \nwould be removed to the Federal courts under the bill are precisely the \ntype of cases that should be heard by such courts in the first place; \nnamely, large national class actions affecting citizens in and around \nthe country, including the very copycat lawsuits I have discussed \ntoday.\n  Class actions generally have three things in common. No. 1, they \ninvolve the most people. No. 2, they involve the most money. And No. 3, \nthey involve the most interstate commerce issues. Taken as a whole, the \nnational implications of class actions are far greater than many of the \ncases filed and heard by the Federal courts today. With this in mind, \none is left to wonder how anyone could argue that these actions are not \ndeserving of the attention of our Federal courts.\n  As Chief Justice Marshall noted:\n\n       However true the fact may be, that the tribunals of the \n     States will administer justice as impartially as to those of \n     the nation, to parties of every description, it is not less \n     true that the Constitution itself either entertains \n     apprehensions on this subject, or views with such indulgence \n     the possible fears and apprehensions of suitors, that it has \n     established national tribunals for the decision of \n     controversies between aliens and citizens, or between \n     citizens of different States.\n\n  When the Framers of the Constitution created the Federal courts in \narticle 3 of the Constitution, they gave them jurisdiction over cases \ninvolving large interstate disputes, cases such as class actions. \nContrary to the claims of opponents of this bill, article 3 does not \nrequire complete diversity amongst parties to a claim.\n  The Class Action Fairness Act will also help protect the interests of \nconsumer class members from copycat lawsuits. When duplicative lawsuits \nare pending in different States, a settlement or judgment in any one \ncase has the potential to make every other pending case moot. This \nwinner-takes-all scenario acts as an incentive for plaintiffs' lawyers \nwith multiple class actions to seek a quick settlement in the case, \neven if the settlement does no more than make the lawyers involved \nrich. The bona fide claims of the plaintiffs to the other class actions \nare wiped out by the settlement. That is not fair, but that is what is \nhappening.\n\n[[Page S1229]]\n\nSometimes they file multiple suits so they can force a settlement with \na simple settlement demand. And what company wouldn't pay the defense \ncosts to get out of this type of abusive jurisdiction of the various \ncourts throughout the country.\n  What this means is that while one injured consumer in one court of \nthe country recovers for their injuries, an identically injured \nconsumer in another part of the country may get nothing. The quick \nsettlement of a copycat lawsuit may essentially steal the ability for \nsimilarly situated plaintiffs to fully or fairly recover for their \ninjuries, especially if the forum-shopped court is going to pull this \nkind of stuff and favor certain attorneys over others and certain \nclients over others rather than do what is just under the law.\n\n  Under S. 5, many of these copycat lawsuits would be removed to \nFederal court and consolidated to ensure that all similarly situated \nplaintiffs received the same recovery under any settlement. Unlike \nState courts, Federal courts are equipped with a mechanism for \nconsolidating similar claims. In the Federal court system, a judge may \nconsolidate multiple identical lawsuits found in various jurisdictions \ninto one proceeding before a single Federal court known as the \nmultidistrict litigation panel or MDL. The MDL panel has proven to be a \nvaluable tool for preventing abuse, judicial waste, and disparate \noutcomes in Federal courts.\n  Under this system, much of the time-consuming pretrial activity in \nthe lawsuit is heard by a single court. This serves to help protect \nagainst the plaintiffs' lawyer from making a separate deal for some \nplaintiffs that is not in the best interests of all class members. And \nby the way, for those who argue that consumers are being hurt by this \nbill, guess how many consumers are hurt by a collusion between \nplaintiffs' counsel and a particular corporation to settle in one State \nthat wipes out everybody else throughout the country.\n  That happens. It happens because we have not solved these problems. \nThis bill goes a long way toward solving some of these problems.\n  S. 5 solves this very problem by ensuring that a plaintiff's claim is \nnot extinguished by the settlement of the duplicative action in another \npart of the country. This bill protects consumers in areas where they \nare not protected under current law.\n  Before I close, I want to stress that this bill does not change \nsubstantive law. The Class Action Fairness Act does not make it any \nharder or easier to file or win a lawsuit unless, of course, winning is \nunjustly based upon an uneven playing field. In other words, courts who \nhomer the cases because they want to help certain attorneys who have \nsupported them for their election to those State court positions.\n  This bill is one that is long overdue. As Chief Justice Rehnquist \nstated:\n\n       We can no longer afford the luxury of State and Federal \n     courts that work at cross-purposes or irrationally duplicate \n     one another.\n\n  This bill is a procedural bill that applies common sense to \nstreamline the court system. The underlying substantive law is the same \nfor class actions whether they are in Federal or in State court. This \nbill is a balanced, modest approach to solving some of the most abusive \nproblems in our current civil justice system. Members on both sides of \nthe aisle have worked long and hard to formulate a bipartisan bill, and \nwe are succeeding in this bipartisan effort on behalf of the American \npeople.\n  I steadfastly support the Class Action Fairness Act and urge my \ncolleagues to do so as well, because it is the right thing to do. It is \nthe right thing to do for the legal profession and for the plaintiffs \nwho deserve compensation.\n  I have been in some pretty tough cases in my day, but I have never \nseen a case I could not win if the case was the right thing to bring. I \nwould not bring it if it were not the right thing to bring. I loved \nbeing in Federal court, time I could get there. I also loved being in \nState court. I never wanted a judge to lean my way or the other way. I \nwanted the judge to be down the middle, and if that is the case, I \nthought I stood a good chance of winning the case.\n  We are talking about unfair advantage here in these magnet courts, \nthese forum-shopped areas. Madison County has become the ``poster \nchild'' for magnet courts. It deserves its reputation.\n  This is an important bill. This is a bill that makes sense. This bill \ndoes not deprive anybody of rights. This is a bill that will resolve a \nlot of these conflicts and problems, and it is a bill that I think will \nhelp all within the legal community to live within certain legal and \nmoral constraints.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 12:30, the \nSenate resume debate on the Feingold amendment, and that the time be \nequally divided in the usual form; provided that at 12:40, 10 minutes \nlater, the Senate proceed to a vote in relation to the Feingold \namendment, with no intervening action or debate and no amendments in \norder to the amendment prior to the vote. I further ask consent that \nfollowing that vote, debate be equally divided between the two leaders \nor their designees until the hour of 3 p.m.; provided further that the \ntime between 2:20 and 2:40 be equally divided between Senator Specter \nand Senator Leahy; and that at 2:40, the final 20 minutes be reserved, \nwith the Democratic leader in control of 10 minutes, to be followed by \nthe majority leader for the final 10 minutes; provided further that at \n3 o'clock, the Senate proceed to a vote in relation to the Durbin \namendment, with no amendment in order to the amendment prior to the \nvote. I further ask unanimous consent that following that vote the bill \nbe read the third time and the Senate proceed to a vote on passage of \nthe bill, with no intervening action or debate. Finally, I ask that no \nother amendments be in order other than the two above-mentioned \namendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hatch). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, in light of the unanimous consent \nagreement that will bring this bill to closure, there is something I \nneeded to get on the record. I appreciate getting a few minutes. I \nintend to vote for the bill. Everything the Senator said about the bill \nis very much true. The Senator from Utah has been working as chairman \nfor years. The legal abuse that the Senator described is real. This \nbill really brings it to an end.\n  I found Federal court to be a fair place to try cases. The Senator is \nalso right about the scope of class action lawsuits. They involve many \npeople from different places throughout the country. We have a good \nbalance in the bill of when you can be removed. Every class action is \nnot going to go to Federal court. If the formula is right, and if it \nhas enough national impact, Federal court will be the place to go \nbecause of the abuses described.\n  Those of us who practiced law for a living before we got here \nunderstand that the legal system can be reformed. I admire what the \nSenator from Utah and Senators Specter and Grassley have done to bring \nabout reform. But we find ourselves in a unique political dynamic with \nthis bill. Our friends in the House say they want it like we have it. \nWe all agree there are amendments that could make the bill better that \nwe would vote for, but the political moment will not allow that to \nhappen. I regret not offering in committee the amendment I am going to \nspeak about. I learned from my mistakes there.\n  One of the things we have done by federalizing certain class action \nlawsuits is we have taken the abuse out of the system, and we have gone \nto Federal court to have a more fair way of\n\n[[Page S1230]]\n\ndoing business when the formula is right and when there is a national \nimpact to stop home cooking.\n  The reason the diversity clause exists to begin with is that when you \nhave two people from different States, you want to pick a neutral \nsight. You do not want to do home cooking. Really, the whole goal of \nthis bill is to get it in a neutral site where people can have their \nfair day in court. I certainly appreciate that.\n  But there is another component to class actions that is missing in \nthis bill. Class actions, by their very nature, as Senator Hatch \ndescribed, involve a lot of people from different places and usually a \nlot is at stake. Sometimes it is money. Sometimes it is a business \npractice that does not have a lot of economic effect on one person, but \nwhen you add up the economic effect, it is bad for the country. People \nare cheating. People are nickel and diming folks, getting rich at the \nexpense of the elderly or the infirm, by taking a few dollars here, and \nit adds up to be a very bad situation for the country. Those type cases \nlend themselves to class action.\n  There is another group of cases that could lend themselves to class \naction, too. That is when products are not designed right. They are \nconsumer cases where consumers throughout the country are affected by \nthe particular behavior in question.\n  Most States have a procedure, when such cases exist affecting the \npublic at large, where the judge is able to determine what is fair in \nterms of sealing documents relating to settlements. I had an amendment \nthat was modeled after a South Carolina statute--and over 20 States \nhave a similar statute--that says in cases where the public's interest \nis present, where there is a consumer case that affects the health or \nwell-being of the community at large, settlements can be sealed, \ndocuments can be made secret to protect business interests, but only if \nthe judge determines that the public interest is also being met.\n  The amendment I proposed would have received well over 50 votes in \nthis body, and I think Senator Hatch would have been friendly to it. \nBut I understand the effect it would have on the bill.\n  The current chairman, Senator Specter, and I will have a colloquy for \nthe record. This is the point of my seeking recognition.\n  This bill will leave the Senate and go to the House in a way to solve \nabuse, but I think it is lacking in consumer protections. The reason I \nam speaking today is this colloquy for the record with Senator Specter \nrecognizes the value of this amendment and a commitment on his part and \nthe committee's part to allow this amendment to move forward at another \ndate, another time, in another place.\n  The reason I am agreeing to that is enough of my colleagues who are \nsympathetic to the amendment do not want to vote for anything that \nwould derail the bill. I very much appreciate that because that is the \nway politics is, and there is nothing wrong with that as long as we do \nnot lose sight of the goal. And the goal is to have a balance, to take \ncare of abuses, but at the same time protect the public when the public \nneeds to be protected.\n  What I am trying to say is I will not put my colleagues in a bad spot \nof having to vote down an amendment with which they agree because I do \nnot have 50 votes. I am mature enough to know when you can win and when \nyou cannot. Sometimes it is OK to lose. Losing is not bad as long as \nyou feel good about what you are doing.\n\n  I do not want to offer the amendment, have colleagues vote against \nit, and create problems unnecessarily, but I do want my colleagues to \nknow--and this colloquy will express this--that this bill needs to be \namended and this problem needs to be addressed. We need to have a \nprovision that is married up with the bill that is about to leave the \nSenate and go to the House that will allow a judge, upon motion of the \nparties, to determine in a situation where there is a request to keep \nthe settlement secret and seal the documents from public review, to \nhave a judge to determine what documents should be sealed in secret and \nwhat documents should be released to the public, balancing the needs of \nbusiness and the right of the public to know what they should know \nabout their health and their safety.\n  There were class action cases with the sunshine statute, about which \nI am talking, in effect. Without that statute, deadly lighters, \nexploding tires, defective drugs, toxic chemicals, and faulty \nautomobile designs would not have been known if it were not for a \nprocedure for the judge to release certain documents because the \nrequest was: We will give you money, but you cannot tell anybody about \nthe underlying problem.\n  Sometimes that is very much unfair. I have case after case of \nsunshine statutes allowing the judge to determine what was in the \npublic interest, to inform the public of deadly events, and peoples \nlives were saved and their health was protected.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I ask unanimous consent for 2 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           protective orders\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I appreciate Chairman Specter taking the \ntime to join me in discussing a concern I have regarding S. 5, the \nclass action bill. I am still prepared to seek a vote on my amendment, \nbut based on my conversations with a number of senators this week, \nincluding Chairman Specter, and in a desire to see this bill pass as \nsoon as possible, I have decided not to offer my amendment.\n  I agreed to support this bill some time ago because I believe we are \nlong overdue for reform in the class action area. Over the last few \nyears, I have worked to support this bill in both the Judiciary \nCommittee and on the senate floor.\n  While I have fully supported this reform, I have also noticed some \nareas where the bill could be improved. I had hoped to offer an \namendment on the floor regarding protective orders during discovery. I \nam confident that the amendment that I had hoped to introduce with \nSenator Prior of Arkansas would have made a significant improvement in \nthe area of class action discovery.\n  Our amendment is very simple. It is based on the local rule in South \nCarolina Federal Courts for obtaining protective orders for documents. \nAll it says is, if you want a protective order, you must make a motion \nat the beginning of trial, explain why it is necessary for the court to \nseal your documents, and provide public notice of the motion and a \ndescription of the documents. that's it.\n  At least 20 states have taken action to limit secrecy agreements. \nThis type of scrutiny should be extended throughout the nation, \nespecially where we are removing parties from the protections afforded \nthem by their States.\n  And let me be clear. This is not an onerous burden to place on those \nseeking protective orders. It is not that far a departure from the \ncurrent discovery rules. We could have gone a lot further; with higher \nstandards, a presumption against sealing, and other controversial \ndiscovery reforms. However, we are not seeking to tilt the playing \nfield to one side or the other, just make sure some reasonable, well-\nthought out ground rules are applied to everyone.\n  My amendment creates a presumption of openness--it would require the \nparties in class action lawsuits to justify their requests for secrecy, \nfollowed by a medical review of the information they want the court to \nkeep under seal.\n  They would have to identify the documents or information they want \nsealed--and most importantly the reasons why it's necessary to keep \nthem secret.\n  They also would have to explain why a protective order approach is \nnecessary and justify the request based on controlling case law.\n  The public would be notified of the information that was being put \nunder seal--and a descriptive non-confidential index of the secret \ndocuments would be provided.\n  In the end, however, it is still up to the judge's discretion, albeit \nwith a slightly higher standard than currently exist under the Federal \nrules of civil procedure.\n  I am doing this because I am convinced Federal Judges will come down \non the side of consumer protection where it's in the public interest \nand come down on the side of secrecy where merited. In short, while the \nburden here is on any party that wants to keep\n\n[[Page S1231]]\n\nsomething secret, it is not an onerous task, nor impossible.\n  Valid trade secrets and proprietary information--sensitive \ninformation that goes to the heart of a company being able to compete \nin the market place should and will be protected. There must be \nsafeguards for businesses--they have a right to protect valid trade \nsecrets--patents and other proprietary information. But this isn't \nsomething that can just go on automatic pilot--there has to be some \njudicial review and I am confident the procedures protect all the \nparties in a class action lawsuit.\n  So again, we have merely tried to find a way to balance the \nlegitimate interests of companies, who we want to remain strong \ncompetitors in the marketplace, with the public's interest in \ndisclosing potentially harmful products or practices.\n  Our amendment strikes the right balance because it raises the bar \nonly slightly for companies to justify why they need to impose secrecy, \nusing our courts to do so, but does not force them to open up their \ncompanies to every passerby simply because they are defending a \nlawsuit.\n  Now there are critics who warn that an amendment like this is going \nto create a number of problems in the judicial system, making discovery \nmore difficult and deterring settlements.\n  I do not agree. Take a look at Florida, which has one of the most \nstringent sunshine laws. I don't think anyone can tell you Florida is a \nmagnet for class actions. In fact, the most recent studies in the 20 \nStates that have sunshine laws show that limiting court secrecy has not \nled to more litigation or curtailed the number of case that are \nsettled.\n  In fact I do not believe there is any evidence that supports the \nproposition that more cases will go to trial and fewer settlements will \nbe reached if some procedural safeguards are put in place.\n  Also, you have to remember that our amendment only applied to court-\nordered secrecy. Parties would still have been free to privately agree \nupon secrecy between them.\n  In closing Mr. President, I must say I have been a bit taken aback by \nall the turmoil this amendment has caused. I am pretty sure we can all \nagree that ours was a fairly benign procedural amendment, one that \nserves both the public and those before our courts.\n  Toward that end, I very much appreciate the understanding I and \nSenator Pryor have been able to reach with Chairman Specter regarding \nthe substance of our amendment. The chairman has graciously agreed to \nassist us with this amendment in the Judiciary Committee. I thank the \nchairman and look forward to working with him to address this issue in \nthe near future.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I appreciate Senator Graham's willingness to help us \nmove forward on this bill. He and I have agreed that, due to the \nprocedural posture of this particular bill, we should address the \nsubstance of his amendment in committee in the future.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank my chairman for his future assistance.\n  Mr. President, I say to my colleagues that they will have done a good \nthing by passing this bill. They will do a very good thing if we can \ntake up this amendment at another time to make this bill more balanced \nbecause the abuses as described by Senator Hatch are real. My \ncolleagues have worked a long time to bring about this date. They \nshould be proud of it.\n  There is a way to make this bill better, and if we do not address \nthis problem, I predict something is going to happen out there without \na sunshine amendment. There is going to be a class action case \ninvolving consumer interests, and if there is no procedure for the \njudge to balance the public interests against business interests, we \nare going to shield the public from something they should know. There \nis no reason we cannot do both: Stop the legal abuse and help \nconsumers. It is my pledge and my promise to work with everybody in \nthis body to make that happen.\n  I yield the floor and thank the Senate for its indulgence.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa. Without objection, the \nSenator is recognized on the minority time.\n\n\n                            amendment no. 12\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to Senator \nFeingold's amendment which would add a provision to the bill requiring \nthe Federal courts to consider remand motions in class actions within a \nset timetable. This amendment needs to be rejected because it is \nunnecessary.\n  There is not any evidence that the Federal courts are particularly \nslow in dealing with class actions, or specifically that they are slow \nrelative to remand motions. In fact, there is evidence that the Federal \ncourts move more quickly than State courts in considering these motions \nbecause they always consider jurisdictional issues first. Senator \nFeingold cites three examples of delay to support his amendment, but I \ndo not think that is enough to start placing strict time limits on \ncourt procedure. I think that Senator Feingold is in search of a \nproblem that does not really exist.\n  Also, the amendment could make it hard for judges to issue fair \nrulings in complicated class action cases because judges would be \nforced to make rushed decisions. This deadline may be too stringent and \ninflexible to deal with complex cases, where sometimes several remand \nmotions are considered jointly in order to conserve judicial resources. \nThese motions may require hearings, and the timeframe provided in \nSenator Feingold's amendment may not be enough time for a court to \nschedule a hearing and consider all the evidence.\n  I also understand that Federal judges who have learned of this \npossible time limitation on deciding these kinds of motions are \nconcerned that it would place an unreasonable restriction on their \nability to fairly decide cases. The Judicial Conference sent a letter \nopposing a previous iteration of Senator Feingold's amendment that was \nmore stringent that the current language. However, this amendment still \nputs significant time constraints on Federal judges that could prove to \nbe too stringent.\n  So there just is not any evidence that there is a problem with remand \nmotions in class action cases that requires this time limitation that \nSenator Feingold is proposing. This is just an attempt to weaken the \nbill. So I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina). The Senator \nfrom Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I have \nrestored the full 5 minutes I was originally given.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I ask unanimous consent to have the 5 minutes restored. \nI would appreciate that, because the chairman who is handling this bill \non the floor asked me to stay in committee and finish the bankruptcy \nhearing. I feel justified in asking for my time to be restored.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, everyone understands that this bill will \nallow many more class actions to be removed from State to Federal \ncourt, but as the supporters have been proclaiming all week long, there \nare still class actions that belong in State court, even under this \nbill. Unfortunately, that may not stop defendants from removing cases \nthat should still be in State court.\n  When a notice of removal is filed, the case is removed to Federal \ncourt. There is no proceeding in the State court to make sure the \nremoval is proper. It is up to the Federal court to decide that \nquestion, but only if the plaintiffs file a motion to remand to return \nthe case back to the State court.\n  The amendment I have offered is designed simply to make sure that \nthis process of removal and remand does not become a tool for delaying \ncases that actually belong in State court. It requires a district court \nto take a look at a motion to remand within 60 days of filing and then \ndo one of two things: Decide it, which I hope will be possible in \nalmost all cases, or issue an order stating why a decision is not yet \npossible. If the court issues that order, it must then reach a decision \nwithin 180 days of filing. The parties can agree on an extension of any \nlength.\n  I want to make this clear because I heard Senator Grassley responding \nto my original argument when I came on the floor. The amendment before \nus actually gives the court a great deal of flexibility. It will also \nassure that a\n\n[[Page S1232]]\n\nmotion to remand does not languish for months, or even years, before a \ncourt reviews it and says, oops, this case really should be back in \nState court.\n  As I noted last night, we have many examples of remand motions \nsitting unresolved for a year and then the case goes back to State \ncourt.\n\n  As the Senator from Iowa pointed out, the Judicial Conference did \noppose my amendment in committee that had a strict limit of 60 days, \nbut what I have done to try to accommodate this concern, which I \nbelieve moves in their direction, is tripled that limit in the pending \namendment. I think that is eminently reasonable, as the Senator from \nDelaware, a strong supporter of this bill, acknowledged last night on \nthis floor.\n  The bill itself provides that appeals of remand motions must be \ndecided within 60 days. So why would there be any substantive argument \nagainst having a similar limitation at the district court level?\n  I heard the Senator from Utah suggesting that somehow my amendment \ndenies due process, but I suggest that 180 days is enough time to \nhandle any remand motion. That is time for discovery and for an \nevidentiary hearing. The problem is that without a deadline, the motion \ncan sit there for a year or longer without any action.\n  What I am hearing from some of my colleagues who support the bill and \nrecognize that what I am trying to do is reasonable is that they cannot \nupset the delicate agreement that has been reached with the House. On \nthis one, I cannot accept that. It makes no sense to me that Senators \nwould give up their independent judgment because of a fear of the \nleadership of the other body. Does anyone think, after everything this \nbill has been through, that the House leadership is going to refuse to \npass this bill if my very reasonable amendment, simply making sure that \nmotions to remand are decided on time, is included? Are they going to \nfurther delay this bill for this? I do not think so.\n  This amendment does not blow the bill up. It is not a poison pill. \nEveryone I have talked to says this amendment basically makes sense. So \nI implore my colleagues to exercise their own good judgment, accept \nthis amendment, and persuade their colleagues on the House side and the \nbusiness community, which several of my colleagues have told me \nprivately, that this amendment makes sense.\n  It does not harm the bill. In fact, it makes the bill better because \nit means all the cases we agree on should remain in State court will \nactually proceed in State court without delay.\n  I thank the Chair for according me this additional time. I yield the \nfloor, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 12.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 2:20 \np.m. is equally divided between the leaders or their designees. Who \nyields time?\n  The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, in an hour or two or three, we will have \nthe opportunity to vote final passage on class action reform \nlegislation.\n  The goals of this legislation are fourfold: One is to make sure when \npeople--I say ``little'' people--are harmed by companies, big or small \ncompanies, that the little people have the opportunity to band together \nand be made whole and compensated for harm. The second goal is to make \nsure the companies know that if they shortchange their customers or \nothers in our country, there will be a price to pay if they get caught. \nThe third goal is to make sure when companies are called on the carpet \nand are involved in class action litigation, they are in a court, in a \ncourthouse, with a judge, where the companies have a fair shake and the \ndeck is not stacked against them. Finally, our goal is to make sure \nthat, in shifting some class action litigation of a national scope with \nhundreds of or thousands of plaintiffs across the Nation, multimillions \nof dollars involved and defendants scattered across the country in \ndifferent States than the plaintiffs, to make sure we move some class \naction litigation to Federal courts, we do not overburden the already \nbusy Federal judiciary.\n  I take a moment or two today to go through and cite examples--not all \nof them; this is not an exhaustive list--but some of the examples we \nhave sought to make sure in many instances that the majority of class \naction litigation remains in State court where it belongs.\n  Let me cite a couple of examples where this bill has been modified \nover the years to enable a majority of class action litigation cases to \nstay in State courts. For example, these are cases where the litigation \nwill remain in State courts: No. 1, cases against State and State \nofficials will remain in state court. Smaller cases will remain in \nState court. Cases where there are fewer than 100 plaintiffs or in \nwhich less than $5 million is at stake, those cases are not eligible \nfor removal from State to Federal court. Cases in which two-thirds or \nmore of the plaintiffs are from the same State as the defendant will \nremain in State court. Cases in which between one-third and two-thirds \nof the plaintiffs are from the same State as the defendant may well \nremain in State court. It is left to the discretion of the Federal \njudge to decide whether it is Federal or State based on the criteria \nlaid out in the bill.\n  Similarly, cases involving a local incident or controversy, where the \npeople involved are local, where at least one of the significant \ndefendants involved in the litigation is within the same State, in \nthose instances as well, the cases can and probably should remain in \nState courts.\n  That is a handful of the examples where we make sure a lot of the \nclass action litigation remains in State courts where it belongs.\n  If you go back, the first bill introduced on class action litigation \ngoes back about 7 years, I think, to 1997. That initial bill, along \nwith a number of bills that were introduced in subsequent Congresses, \nwas opposed by the Federal bench. There is an arm of the Federal \njudiciary called the Judicial Conference of the United States. They \nhave a couple different committees, and from time to time they are \nasked, and they respond with their opinion, about whether certain \nlegislation is needed, is appropriate, as it pertains to them and the \nwork they are doing.\n  The initial legislation proposed, I think, in 1997, 1998, was opposed \nby the Federal judiciary through their Judicial Conference of the \nUnited States. In the next Congress, again, the Federal\n\n[[Page S1233]]\n\njudiciary opposed that legislation. As the legislation has evolved, we \nhave gone back to ask the Federal judiciary: What do you think? We know \nyou were opposed to original versions of this bill in the late 1990s. \nHow about this latest revision? They continued to oppose subsequent \nversions of the class action reform until the last Congress.\n  The Federal judiciary has the same concerns a lot of us have, the \nwholesale shifting of class action cases from the State courts to the \nFederal courts. Federal judges are busy, and they do not want to see an \navalanche of litigation coming to them. With the adoption of a number \nof provisions in this legislation that comes to us today, the Judicial \nConference wrote to the Senate in 2003 that, particularly given the \nchanges Senator Feinstein proposed, their concerns about the wholesale \nshifting of State class action litigation to the Federal courts, for \nthe most part, had been met and been satisfied.\n  They are not taking a position, saying the Senate should vote for \nthis legislation. That is not what they are about. But the concerns \nthey had expressed earlier, year after year after year, have been \naddressed.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na letter from the Judicial Conference of the United States, dated April \n25, 2003.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                               Judicial Conference\n\n\n                                         of the United States,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 25, 2003.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: Thank you for your letters of April 9, \n     2003, and April 11, 2003. In those letters, you requested \n     that the Judicial Conference provide the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee with legislative language implementing the Judicial \n     Conference's March 2003 recommendations on class-action \n     litigation and the views of the Conference on S. 274, the \n     ``Class Action Fairness Act of 2003,'' as reported by the \n     Senate Judiciary Committee on April 11, 2003.\n       As you know, at its March 18, 2003, session, the Judicial \n     Conference adopted the following resolution:\n       That the Judicial Conference recognize that the use of \n     minimal diversity of citizenship may be appropriate to the \n     maintenance of significant multi-state class action \n     litigation in the federal courts, while continuing to oppose \n     class action legislation that contains jurisdictional \n     provisions that are similar to those in the bills introduced \n     in the 106th and 107th Congresses. If Congress determines \n     that certain class actions should be brought within the \n     original and removal jurisdiction of the federal courts on \n     the basis of minimal diversity of citizenship and an \n     aggregation of claims, Congress should be encouraged to \n     include sufficient limitations and threshold requirements so \n     that the federal courts are not unduly burdened and states' \n     jurisdiction over in-state class actions is left undisturbed, \n     such as by employing provisions to raise the jurisdictional \n     threshold and to fashion exceptions to such jurisdiction that \n     would preserve a role for the state courts in the handling of \n     in-state class actions. Such exceptions for in-state class \n     actions may appropriately include such factors as whether \n     substantially all members of the class are citizens of a \n     single state, the relationship of the defendants to the forum \n     state, or whether the claims arise from death, personal \n     injury, or physical property damage within the state. \n     Further, the Conference should continue to explore additional \n     approaches to the consolidation and coordination of \n     overlapping or duplicative class actions that do not unduly \n     intrude or state courts or burden federal courts.\n       S. 274, as reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee, \n     generally provides for federal jurisdiction of a class action \n     based on minimal diversity of citizenship if the matter in \n     controversy exceeds the sum of $5 million, exclusive of \n     interest and costs. (S. 274 as introduced established a $2 \n     million minimum amount in controversy.) The bill also now \n     permits a federal district court, in the interests of \n     justice, to decline to exercise jurisdiction over a class \n     action in which greater than one-third but less than two-\n     thirds of the members of all proposed plaintiff classes in \n     the aggregate and the primary defendants are citizens of the \n     state in which the action was originally filed. The court \n     would be required to consider five specified factors when \n     exercising this discretion. (This discretionary provision was \n     not included in the bill as introduced.)\n       In addition, S. 274 as reported provides that the federal \n     district courts shall not have original jurisdiction over any \n     class action in which: (A) two-thirds or more of the members \n     of all proposed plaintiff classes in the aggregate and the \n     primary defendants are citizens of the state in which the \n     action was originally filed; (B) the primary defendants are \n     states, state officials, or other governmental entities \n     against whom the district court may be foreclosed from \n     ordering relief; or (C) the number of members of all proposed \n     plaintiff classes in the aggregate is less than one hundred. \n     As introduced, the second and third exceptions were the same, \n     but the first one originally precluded federal jurisdiction \n     where ``the substantial majority of the members of the \n     proposed plaintiff class and the primary defendants are \n     citizens of the State in which the action was originally \n     filed'' and ``the claims asserted therein will be governed \n     primarily by the laws of that state. The replacement language \n     in essence substitutes a numerical ratio for ``substantial \n     majority'' and eliminates the choice-of-law requirement.\n       We are grateful that Congress is working to resolve the \n     serious problems generated by overlapping and competing class \n     actions. The Judicial Conference ``recognizes that the use of \n     minimal diversity of citizenship may be appropriate to the \n     maintenance of significant multi-state class action \n     litigation in the federal courts.'' At the same time, the \n     Judicial Conference does not support the removal of all state \n     law class actions into federal court. Appropriate legislation \n     should ``include sufficient limitations and threshold \n     requirements so that federal courts are not unduly burdened \n     and states' jurisdiction over in-state class actions is left \n     undisturbed.'' Finding the right balance between these \n     objectives and articulating that balance in legislative \n     language implicate important policy choices.\n       Any minimal-diversity bill will result in certain cases \n     being litigated in federal court that would not previously \n     have been subject to federal jurisdiction. The effects of \n     this transfer should be assessed in determining the \n     appropriateness of various limitations on the availability of \n     minimal diversity jurisdiction.\n       Certain kinds of cases would seem to be inherently ``state-\n     court'' cases--cases in which a particular state's interest \n     in the litigation is so substantial that federal court \n     jurisdiction ought not be available. At the same time, \n     significant multi-state class actions would seem to be \n     appropriate candidates for removal to federal court.\n       The Judicial Conference's resolution deliberately avoided \n     specific legislative language, out of deference to Congress's \n     judgment and the political process. These issues implicate \n     fundamental interests and relationships that are political in \n     nature and are peculiarly within Congress's province. \n     Notwithstanding this general view, we can, however, confirm \n     that the Conference has no objection to proposals: (1) to \n     increase the threshold jurisdictional amount in controversy \n     for federal minimal diversity jurisdiction; (2) to increase \n     the number of all proposed plaintiff class members required \n     for maintenance of a federal minimal-diversity class action; \n     and (3) to confer upon the assigned district judge the \n     discretion to decline to exercise jurisdiction over a \n     minimal-diversity federal class action if whatever criteria \n     imposed by the statute are satisfied. Finally, the Conference \n     continues to encourage Congress to ensure that any \n     legislation that is crafted does not ``unduly intrude on \n     state courts or burden federal courts.''\n       We thank you for your efforts in this most complex area of \n     jurisdiction and public policy.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           Leonidas Ralph Mercham,\n                                                        Secretary.\n\n  Mr. CARPER. We are going to vote on final passage in an hour or two. \nI think Senator Durbin is going to come to the floor. He may ask for a \nvote on his amendment. I am not sure he will. He cares deeply, \npassionately about these issues and has sought to try to make sure that \nwe end up not making bad, unwise public policy decisions. My guess is, \nhe is not going to come to the floor and urge us to vote for the bill \nor say he is going to vote for it. I know he has serious misgivings \nabout this legislation. But he has worked constructively, as have \npeople on our side and the Republican side, to get us to this point in \ntime.\n  Senator Reid of Nevada is our new leader on the Democratic side. He \nis not on the floor, but I express to him and my colleagues, if he is \nlistening, my heartfelt thanks for working with the Republican \nleadership and those on our side who support this legislation, to \nenable us to have this opportunity to debate it fairly and openly, \nallowing people who like it, people who do not like it, those who \nwanted to offer amendments, those who did not want to offer amendments, \nto have a chance for the regular order to take place, to debate the \nissues and vote, and then to move on.\n  I do not know if this legislation, the way we have taken it up and \ndebated it, can serve as a template or example to use in addressing \nother difficult issues--energy policy, asbestos litigation, a variety \nof other issues--but it might. Because in this case, Democratic and \nRepublican leaders have worked together, have urged us, the rank and \nfile in the Senate, to work together.\n  Each of the folks in the private sector--people who have an interest \nin this bill, not only the business side, but the plaintiffs' lawyers \nside, and other\n\n[[Page S1234]]\n\ninterested parties, labor, and so forth, consumer groups--I think \neverybody has acted in good faith to get us to this point in time.\n  Whether you like the bill, I urge my Democratic colleagues, if you \nare on the edge and not sure which way to go--you may have voted for \nall these amendments, and you are not sure how to vote on final passage \nof the bill--I urge you to vote for this bill.\n  I do not know if it is possible to have a big margin. I would love to \nhave 70 votes, 75 votes for this bill. I hope we can do that.\n  Let me close, if I can, by saying, whether you are for the bill or \nagainst it, for the amendments or against them, I hope there is one \nthing we can all agree upon. I will bring to mind the words of one of \nour colleagues, a legendary trial lawyer from Illinois, who has gone on \nto be elected and serves with us in the Senate. I will close my \ncomments with his admonition. That admonition is the old Latin phrase: \nsemper ubi sub ubi. Whether you like the bill, I think we can all agree \non that admonition today.\n  With that having been said, I yield back my time and suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that again we go \ninto a quorum call, but that the time be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, this week's debate is the culmination of \nmore than 6 years of work in the Senate on a very important piece of \nlegislation, reform that is needed in the U.S. legal system--class \naction reform.\n  I practiced law for most of my adult life and have litigated in a \nnumber of different forums. I believe in our legal system. It is \ncritical for America's economic vitality and our liberty to have a good \nlegal system. There is no doubt in my mind that the strength of this \nAmerican democracy, the power of our economy, and our ability to \nmaintain freedom and progress are directly dependent on our commitment \nto the rule of law and a superb legal system, and we can make it \nbetter.\n  To keep our system strong, we in this Congress have to meet our \nresponsibility to pass laws that improve litigation in America. Our \ncourt system must produce effective results that further our national \npolicy, correct wrongs, punish wrongdoers, and generate compensation \nfor those who suffer losses in a fair and objective way. We, therefore, \nas a Congress must periodically review what is happening in our courts \nand make adjustments if they are needed. That is what we are here for.\n  This class action fairness bill, S. 5, seeks to make the adjustments \nwe currently need, in my opinion. It will guarantee that the plaintiffs \nin a class action, the people who have been actually harmed and have a \nright to be compensated, are the actual beneficiaries of the class \naction and not just their attorneys and not sometimes the defendants \nwho benefit by being able to get rid of a bunch of potential litigation \nby settleing the case and paying less to the plaintiffs than the case \nis really worth.\n  The Class Action Fairness Act will not move ``all class actions'' to \nFederal Court or ``shut the doors to the courthouse'' as some have \nclaimed--rather it will provide fairness for the class action parties \nby allowing a class action to be removed from a State court where it \nhas been filed to a Federal court when the aggregate amount in question \nexceeds $5 million and the home State plaintiffs make up two-thirds or \nless of the plaintiff class.\n  The Act contains a bill of rights for class action plaintiffs to \nensure that coupon settlements or net loss awards receive special \nscrutiny. We have had some real problems with those. The stories are \npainful to recite by those of us who believe in a good legal system.\n  Furthermore, the Class Action Fairness Act will provide notice to \npublic officials of proposed settlements--I was an attorney general, \nand I know that notice is given to the proper official in a State so \nthat public officials can react if the settlement appears to be unfair \nto some or all of the class members.\n  The Class Action Fairness Act has been through the proper charnels in \nthe Senate. The Act has been through the Judiciary Committee not just \nonce but twice. The bill originally passed out of the Judiciary \nCommittee by a 12 to 7 vote over a year ago in June of 2003. It was a \nbipartisan vote. Since then, it has gone through two substantive \nnegotiations, each bringing on more Senators to support the bill. Just \nlast week, we again passed a bill out of the Judiciary Committee, this \ntime with an even stronger vote of 13 to 5. Today, we expect that more \nthan 70 Senators will support it. The bill is a responsible, restrained \nbill that will curb class action abuses and further productive class \naction litigation.\n  The concept of class actions is a good one. Class actions can be \nextraordinarily effective tools in helping us deal with legal problems \nconfronting America. Sometimes error or negligence is committed by more \nthan one defendant which harms multiple litigants. In such cases, the \nnumber of cases filed can quickly become unmanageable if separate \nindividual lawsuits are required by each person who suffered the harm. \nOne hundred thousand individual lawsuits would not be appropriate when \none case could settle the issue for all involved.\n  Anyone looking closely at our legal system today knows that we have a \nnumber of problems to address. One of the main problems is how much the \nsystem costs the average American. Americans pay these costs primarily \nthrough increased insurance premiums. They also pay it in increased \ncosts for our judiciary.\n  The 2004 Tillinghast study on the cost of U.S. tort systems found \nthat the U.S. tort system--a tort is a lawsuit or an act that has \nwronged or injured someone--cost $246 billion in 2003. That is $845 per \nperson. That is a significant number. It is worthy of repeating. The \ntort system cost $246 billion at an average cost per American citizen \nof $845. That is an average of $70 a month out of somebody's \nlivelihood. Now, $246 billion is equivalent to 2 percent of GDP, gross \ndomestic product. That is a stunning number. By 2006, the study \nestimates that the U.S. tort system will cost over $1,000 per person.\n  Most Americans would be surprised to know that the 2003 version of \nthe Tillinghast study found that the U.S. tort system returned less \nthan 50 cents on the dollar to the people it is designed to help--the \nplaintiffs--and only 22 cents on the dollar to compensate for actual \neconomic loss. Who, then, would appear to be making the money out of \nour current tort system? An earlier Tillinghast study reported that the \nincome of litigation attorneys, trial lawyers, in 2001 was $39 billion. \nThat same year Microsoft made only $26 billion, and Coca-Cola, $17 \nbillion.\n  As a Washington Post editorial has noted: No portion of the American \ncivil justice system is more of a mess than the world of class action.\n  There are a number of problems with the class action system currently \nmaking up the mess The Washington Post referred to.\n  The number of class actions pending in State courts, many of them \nnationwide, increased 1,042 percent from 1988 to 1998, while the number \npending in Federal courts increased only 338 percent during that same \nperiod.\n  State courts are being overwhelmed by class actions. A number of \nState courts lack the necessary resources to supervise the class or the \nproposed settlements affected. Many State judges do not have even one \nlaw clerk, and most of the class actions involve citizens from a number \nof different States, requiring the application of multiple State laws. \nSome times a state court dockets becomes jammed while the judge \nresearches out-of-State law to get up to speed.\n\n[[Page S1235]]\n\n  Some say it is a burden on the Federal courts, but Federal judges \nhave on their docket a fraction of the cases of most State court judges \nin America. Some cases are complex, but that is the nature of Federal \ncourt cases for the most part. They have at least two law clerks. The \noccupant of the chair, Senator Alexander, clerked for Federal judges. \nDistrict court judges all have at least two clerks, and appellate \nFederal judges have three or more. Some of them have their clerical \nsupport become on staff lawyers and then they really end up with three \nclerks. At any rate, they have a greater ability to give the time and \nattention to a major interstate class action involving over $5 million \nand maybe thousands of plaintiffs than an average circuit judge in a \nState court system in America. I do not think that can be disputed.\n  The class action settlement process is problematic because many of \nthe class members have no part in shaping the settlement agreement. In \nfact, many of the members of the class have no knowledge they have even \nbeen involved in a lawsuit or one has been filed on their behalf, \nleading to an abuse of the settlement process. In this scenario, \nplaintiffs' attorneys can find themselves in a position where their \nloyalty is not to these class members. It creates an unhealthy \nsituation. For example, a plaintiffs' lawyer does not know the 1,000 or \n10,000 members of his class. He is talking regularly with the \ndefendant's company, and they say: Let us settle this case.\n  The plaintiffs' lawyer says: We would like to settle this case.\n  They say: What will it take?\n  He says: The plaintiffs want $50 million to settle it.\n  They say: Well, that is too much. Look, why do we not give you \n$10,000 in coupons for all of your victims and we will give you $10 \nmillion or $20 million in legal fees?\n  Now, most lawyers handle themselves well, but that plaintiffs lawyer \nnow finds themselves in an ethical dilemma. His oath as a lawyer says \nthat he or she should defend the interests of the client, get the most \nmoney for their client, but the defendant is dangling out a personally \nlarge fee in exchange for a settlement to end the litigation. We have \nhad that happen, frankly, and we have seen that too often. Too often, \nthe attorneys are the ones who received the big fees, and the named \nplaintiffs, the victims, have gotten very little. It is appropriate, \nthen, that we in this Congress examine this difficulty in our legal \nsystem and tighten it up so we have less of that occur.\n  Many class actions appear to be filed solely for the purpose of \nforcing a settlement, not the protection of an interest of a class, and \nthat has been referred to in debate frequently as ``judicial \nblackmail.'' Rather than losing a public relations battle, going \nthrough court for several years, the defendants often feel they have to \nsettle these cases even if they are frivolous so they do not risk the \ncost of litigation and the embarrassment and difficulty of explaining \nsome complex transaction.\n  There are several other problems. One is forum shopping, and another \nis settlements detrimental for class members.\n  Forum shopping occurs when the attorney sets out to try to find the \nbest place to file the class action lawsuit. You could have a case \ninvolving an attorney from New York with California plaintiffs filing a \nclass action lawsuit in Mobile, AL. Where can national class action \nlawsuits be filed today? Amazingly, the answer is in almost any venue, \nany court, county, circuit court in America. A plaintiff can search \nthis country all over and select the single most favorable venue in \nAmerica for filing their lawsuit--that is, if it is a broad-based class \naction that covers victims in every state and county in America, and \nsome of them do. Some may just cover a region or half the counties in \nAmerica or involve 10 percent of the States. At any rate, they are able \nto search within that area for the most favorable venue.\n  I believe that is not healthy. A report issued this year by the \nAmerican Tort Reform Association about the abuse of this choice named \nthe various counties around the country as ``judicial hellholes.'' The \nstudy pointed to the large number of frivolous class actions found in \ncounties it named, citing judicial cultures that ignore basic due \nprocess and legal protections and efforts by the county's judges to \nintimidate proponents of tort reform.\n  By bringing their suits in one of these areas, plaintiffs' attorneys \ncan defeat diversity by naming a single defendant and a single \nplaintiff who have citizenship in the same State, thus preventing a \nFederal court from hearing the case and allowing a State court in a \nsingle county to bind people all over the country under that one State \nor county's laws.\n  Let me read what the Constitution says about diversity:\n\n       The judicial Power of the United States shall extend to all \n     Cases, in law and equity, arising under this Constitution, \n     the Laws of the United States . . . to Controversies which \n     the United States shall be a party;--Controversies between \n     two or more States, between a State and a Citizen of another \n     State;--between Citizens of different States. . . .\n\n  Our Founding Fathers thought about this issue, and they concluded \nthat, if a person from Alabama wanted to sue a person from Illinois, \nthe person in Illinois might not be comfortable being sued in an \nAlabama state court. They might think that might not be a favorable \nforum. There might be ``home cooking'' for the Alabama citizen there. \nSo they said those cases ought to be in Federal court.\n  As history developed, pretty early in our process it was concluded \nthat diversity required complete diversity; that is, if one plaintiff \nand one of a host of potential defendants was a local defendant, then \nthat could be kept in State court.\n  I am not disputing that. All I am saying is I believe the Founding \nFathers would have believed that a lawsuit that is predominantly \nintrastate in nature, involving the real defendant, should be in \nFederal court.\n  So what happens is if you sue a drug company and you want to keep it \nin State court, you sue the lady in small town Mississippi who sells \nthe prescription at her store--she is a local defendant, whereas the \nperson who is going to be paying the judgment is out of State. If the \ndrug company had been sued directly, it would have been in Federal \ncourt, but by suing one local State defendant along with the big-money \ndeep-pocket in New York, that is not the case.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time controlled by the majority has \nexpired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I will conclude by \nsaying there are a lot of reasons we ought to support this bill. It has \nbeen thought out very carefully. A lot of work has gone into it over a \nnumber of years. We are in a position to pass good legislation at this \ntime.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to spend a few minutes to \ndiscuss my amendment No. 3, which is pending at this time, and then ask \nthat it be withdrawn. This is the amendment I had offered on Tuesday to \nclarify the scope of the ``mass action'' provision in Section 4(a) of \nthe bill.\n  As I had explained earlier this week, this provision requires that \nmass actions be treated the same as class actions under this bill, and \ntherefore taken out of State courts and removed to Federal courts. But \nit was still unclear to me--and to many of the injured people who will \nbe affected by this bill--what precisely the drafters had in mind in \ncoming up with this ``mass action'' language in the bill.\n  When I last took the floor, I had raised some questions about the \ndifferences between ``mass actions'' and ``mass torts,'' and whether \nmass torts would be ,I affected by the language in S. 5. I heard from \nproponents of this bill that these are two very different types of \ncases, and that the bill is designed to affect only mass actions and \nnot mass torts.\n  In fact, Senator Lott of Mississippi the other day explained on the \nfloor that:\n\n       Mass torts and mass actions are not the same. The phrase \n     ``mass torts'' refers to a situation in which many persons \n     are injured by the same underlying cause, such as a single \n     explosion, a series of event, or exposure to a particular \n     product. In contrast, the phrase ``mass action'' refers to a \n     specific type of lawsuit in which a large number of \n     plaintiffs seek to have all their claims adjudicated in one \n     combined trial. Mass actions are basically disguised class \n     actions.\n\n  I am glad that the proponents of this bill agree with me that there \nis a very\n\n[[Page S1236]]\n\n significant difference between these two types of cases. Mass torts \nare large scale personal injury cases that result from accidents, \nenvironmental disasters, or dangerous drugs that are widely sold.\n  Cases like Vioxx that I described earlier, and cases arising from \nasbestos exposure, are examples of mass torts. These personal injury \nclaims are usually based on State laws, and almost every State has well \nestablished rules of procedure to allow their State courts to customize \nthe needs of their litigants in these complex cases.\n  Senator Lott also explained on the floor that:\n\n       There are a few States, like my State--I think, and West \n     Virginia is another one and there may be some others--which \n     do not provide a class action device. In those States, \n     plaintiffs' lawyers often bring together hundreds, sometimes \n     thousands of plaintiffs, to try their claims jointly without \n     having to meet the class action requirements. And often the \n     claims of the multiple plaintiffs have little to do with each \n     other.\n\n  So, it seems to me that the authors of this bill are trying to \ninclude only these so-called mass actions and not mass torts.\n  And I understand from the statements made by Senator Lott, the U.S. \nChamber of Commerce, and many other proponents of the bill, that these \nso-called mass actions are currently filed only in Mississippi and West \nVirginia. In other words, this provision of S. 5 will have no impact on \nmass torts cases filed in the other 48 States.\n  That is good news because I would hate to see this bill--which \nalready turns the idea of federalism on its head--preempt any more \nState rules and procedures than it already does with the diversity \nprovisions.\n  I agree with the proponents that the scope of this language is \nlimited.\n  It is my understanding from conversations with my colleagues who \nsupport this bill that a mass action, as used in this section of the \nbill, is simply a procedural device designed to aggregate for trial \nnumerous claims. If that is the case, I believe my amendment would not \nbe necessary.\n  I had offered my amendment as a good faith effort to keep mass tort \ncases from being impacted negatively by this provision. But if the \nlanguage affects only a narrow set of procedural devices in a limited \nnumber of States, then I believe that is consistent with what I had \nattempted to achieve with my amendment.\n  Accordingly, I ask unanimous consent that my amendment, Amendment No. \n3, be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request of the \nSenator to withdraw the amendment? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would also like to talk about the bill \ngenerally.\n  Why are we even debating a question about whether a lawsuit can be \nfiled in a State court or a Federal court? If you can file a lawsuit, \nyou are supposed to have your day in court. But it is not that simple.\n  The reason why the business lobbies have spent millions of dollars in \nWashington pushing for this bill, the reason why this bill is the \nhighest priority of the Bush administration and the Republican \nleadership in Congress, is because of one simple fact: Class action \ncases removed from State courts to Federal courts are less likely to go \nforward to be tried, they are less likely to reach a verdict where \nsomeone wins or loses, and if there is a decision on behalf of the \nplaintiffs, they are less likely to pay a reasonable amount of money in \nFederal court than in State court.\n  What I say to you is not idle speculation; it is based on Federal \ncourt decisions. That is why the business community has worked so long \nand so hard to remove the rights of consumers and citizens to sue in \ntheir own State courts. Rather, they want them removed to Federal \ncourts where they have a better chance to win. The businesses know they \ncan win more class action cases in Federal courts than they could ever \nwin in State courts. That is what this whole debate is about. So you \nhear all of this talk about whether class action suits are filed here, \nwhether they are filed there--frankly, many of these discussions \noverlook what these class action lawsuits are all about.\n  I had my staff compile some information on some of these lawsuits \nbecause people tell me: I don't understand what is a class action. I \ncan understand if I am in an automobile accident, I get hurt, and I sue \nthe person who ran into me. Is this what we are talking about? That \nprobably wouldn't be a class action.\n  Let me give you some examples of real class action lawsuits. These \ncases will be more difficult to file and more difficult to be \nsuccessful because the business interests are going to pass this bill.\n  U.S. postal workers given Cipro after the anthrax attacks in 2001 \nfound out there were many damages that came from the drug, and the \npostal workers came together as a group to sue the company that made \nCipro. This is a class action lawsuit.\n  Then we had a group of people in Rhode Island who were harmed because \nthey were exposed to lead in paint. They sued, as a class, the \nmanufacturers of lead paint that caused the damage to them physically. \nBut because the manufacturers are not based in Rhode Island, this class \naction might be removed to a Federal court under this bill.\n  Then there was a court in Illinois in a class action lawsuit in one \nof the counties the proponents of this bill like to rail about. It was \nagainst Ford Motor Company because they were selling Ford Crown \nVictoria vehicles to police departments alleging they were better cars \nfor police use. It turned out they had a defective fuel tank that made \nthem dangerous for policemen. So, all of the police departments that \nbought these cars sued Ford Motor Company as a class because of a \ndefective product. But because Ford Motors is based in Michigan, the \nIllinois police officers might have to litigate this case in a Federal \ncourt.\n  Here is another one against Foodmaker, which ran Jack-in-the-Box \nrestaurants. It turned out thousands of their patrons were subjected to \nfood contamination and serious illness. The patrons sued as a class. \nWhy? Because any individual might say: I took my child to Jack-in-the-\nBox, my child became sick and went to the hospital, and was there for \ntwo days. The medical bills came to $1,500. But I can't file a lawsuit \nagainst the restaurant for $1,500.\n  Then, the parent finds out that the same thing happened to hundreds \nof other kids, so all the parents come together and say: Jack-in-the-\nBox, you should have done a better job. And this class of plaintiffs \nwent forward in a State court. But they would have less of a chance for \nsuccess under this bill. That is what it is about.\n  A suit was brought by mothers and fathers when they discovered that \nBeech-Nut was selling apple juice for infants that turned out to be \nnothing but sugar water.\n  What is the damage to an individual infant, or a single family? How \ndo you measure it? If a company sold millions of bottles of this \ndefective product, shouldn't that company be held accountable?\n  That is what this debate is all about. It is about accountability for \nthose who cause harm to the public. The businesses that are responsible \nfor environmental contamination, for producing dangerous products that \ncause injuries, for manufacturing items that shouldn't be sold, or for \novercharging customers, should be held liable.\n  But these business interests come to Congress for help, and they are \ngoing to win today. As a result of this victory, fewer consumers and \nfewer families are going to have a chance to succeed in court.\n  The Government closes down the agencies to protect you, Congress will \nnot pass the laws to protect you, and now this Senate will pass a law \nto close the courthouse doors in your States when you want to come \ntogether as a group and ask for justice. This is the highest priority \nof the Bush administration: closing that courthouse door, making sure \nthese families and these individuals don't have a fighting chance.\n  I think there are a lot of other priorities we should consider, such \nas the cost of health care in America. We will not even talk about that \nissue on the Senate floor, let alone discuss bipartisan options for \naddressing that pressing problem.\n  This so-called Class Action Fairness Act may pass today, but the \nultimate losers are going to be families across\n\n[[Page S1237]]\n\nAmerica who are hoping that Congress will at least consider their best \ninterests in the very first piece of legislation that we consider.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will vote against the Class Action \nFairness Act of 2005 because, although this bill is an improvement over \nprevious versions, it still has significant deficiencies that would \nhave been corrected by a number of common sense amendments that were \nnot adopted.\n  For example, forty seven attorneys general, including the attorney \ngeneral of Michigan, expressed concern that this legislation could \nlimit their powers to investigate and bring actions in their State \ncourts against defendants who have caused harm to their citizens. The \nattorneys general supported an amendment offered by Senator Pryor that \nwould have exempted all actions brought by State Attorneys General from \nthe provisions of S. 5 stating, ``It is important to all of our \nconstituents, but especially to the poor, elderly and disabled, that \nthe provisions of the act not be misconstrued and that we maintain the \nenforcement authority needed to protect them from illegal practices.'' \nThe Pryor amendment was defeated.\n  Federal courts generally do not certify class actions if laws of many \nstates are involved. However, this legislation would force nationwide \nclass actions into Federal courts where they would likely be dismissed \nfor involving too many state laws. This would deprive the plaintiffs \nfrom the opportunity to have their case heard. An amendment sponsored \nby Senator Feinstein, a cosponsor of this legislation, and Senator \nBingaman would have fixed this problem by prohibiting the district \ncourt from denying class certification in whole or in part on the \nground that the law of more than one State will be applied. However, \nthat amendment failed.\n  Senator Feingold offered an amendment that would have set a time \nlimit for a district court to assume jurisdiction or rule on a remand \nmotion to State court. The amendment, which failed, would have provided \nprotection for plaintiffs against attempts to remove cases to Federal \ncourt merely to delay the outcome.\n  We do need class action reform, however this bill fails to adequately \nprotect the rights of our citizens and therefore I cannot support it.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for S. \n5, the Class Action Fairness Act, and to explain why I supported the \namendment proposed by my friend from California, Senator Feinstein, for \nherself and on behalf of my friend from New Mexico, Senator Bingaman.\n  I support the class action legislation before us today. Certain \nlawsuits have become a concern to many Americans. Many lawsuits have \nbeen filed in local State courts that have no connection to the \nplaintiff, the defendant, or the conduct at issue. This allows forum \nshopping, which undercuts the basic fairness of our justice system.\n  Having said that, I am not one of those who think access to the \ncourts should be unduly blocked. Our citizens' use of the courts has \nled to many reforms in the protection of civil rights and the \nenvironment, and has held corporate malefactors accountable for \nimproper conduct that has cost victims billions of dollars. Often for \nthose without power, a lawsuit is the only avenue for redress. We need \nlawsuits, but the rules governing them should be fair.\n  As we have heard yesterday and today, courts in some places have \nbecome magnets for all kinds of lawsuits. Some of these lawsuits are \nmeritorious; some are not. In either scenario, if the case affects the \nNation as a whole, it should be heard in Federal court. Judges in small \ncounties should not make law for all of America. Although those judges \nmight make good law, there is a real risk that parochial concerns would \ndominate in that type of decision. That is not to say that there are \nnot judges in the Federal courts who do not have extreme views on both \nsides of the issues, much as we try not to confirm judges who fall out \nof the mainstream.\n  Consequently, we need to rein in forum shopping. When consumers \nallege that a product sold nationwide to consumers in all 50 States is \ndefective, a Federal court should decide that case.\n  It is for these reasons that I joined with my colleagues, the Senator \nfrom Connecticut, Mr. Dodd, and the Senator from Louisiana, Ms. \nLandrieu, to help craft the compromise that led to the bill before us.\n  The spirit of the compromise we reached would not create a new \nmechanism to dismiss class actions, but instead would remove the large \nand national class actions to the Federal courts.\n  But when Senators Dodd, Landrieu, Carper, Kohl, and I, all of whom \nhave worked so long and hard on this bill, met with the majority leader \nand others 2 years ago, we made perfectly clear the right of the \nminority to offer amendments. That right remains an essential part of \nmy participation in the compromIse.\n  Although we worked hard to improve the bill, we wanted to make sure \nthat our colleagues had the opportunity to offer amendments because no \nbill is perfect.\n  One area where the bill could be improved stems from a real concern \nthat many of the consumer class actions removed to Federal court might \nnot be certified on the grounds that there would be too many non-common \nissues due to differences among State laws that would apply to \ndifferent members of the national class. To date, at least 26 Federal \ndistrict courts have refused to certify class actions on those grounds.\n  Some of us believed that not certifying could have resulted in a \nproblem because it would effectively mean the weakening, if not the \ndisappearance, of the class members' ability to get remedies, \nparticularly with the changes made to current law by this bill. Not \ncertifying could also create a practical problem for lawyers, who have \nthe opportunity to try their class action before one court, and post-\ndecertification might have to re-plead and try several class actions in \nseveral courts, thereby destroying the sought-after efficiency of class \nactions and creating the risk that the results would not be uniform.\n  This was not the desired outcome of our compromise: We intended to \nsend national class actions to Federal court, not to their graves.\n  The amendment that my friend from California, Senator Feinstein, and \nmy friend from New Mexico, Senator Bingaman, introduced would not only \nhave improved the bill, but would have also furthered the spirit of the \ncompromise by clarifying our intention that the bill remove, but \npreserve class actions, even when Federal judges face choice of law \nissues.\n  Importantly, this amendment would not have aided forum-shopping \nplaintiffs' lawyers. Instead, it would have clarified options for a \nFederal judge facing a choice of law question. That clarification would \nhave helped to grind to a halt the class action merry-go-round between \nthe State and Federal courts. I hope that Federal judges view this \nbill, even without the amendment, as a vehicle that was intended to \nbring national class actions to the Nation's courts and not as a \nvehicle to balk at certification. The use of subclasses to protect \npeople's rights under their State laws is now in the hands of Federal \njudges. They have the tools to protect those rights. This bill was not \nintended to destroy them.\n  That view will protect an important instrument of deterrence against \nfuture wrongdoing and an important adjunct to regulators in the \nenforcement of laws protecting our citizens.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, today I rise in support of S. 5, the Class \nAction Fairness Act of 2005. The class action system in our country is \nbroken. Over the past decade, class action lawsuits have grown by over \n1,000 percent nationwide. This extraordinary increase has created a \nsystem that produces hasty claims that are often unjust. Lawsuits that \nhave plaintiffs and defendants from multiple States are tried in small \nState courts with known biases. This leads to irrationally large \nverdicts that make little sense legally or practically.\n  The U.S. Constitution gives jurisdiction to the Federal Government \nwhen cases involve citizens of differing states. It makes sense, that, \nin a case involving plaintiffs from Wyoming and Alabama and defendants \nfrom New York and Idaho, that no party be given the inevitable ``home-\ncourt'' advantage that comes when a case is tried in your backyard. \nRegrettably, for years, Congress has required all plaintiffs to be\n\n[[Page S1238]]\n\ndiverse from all defendants. In large class action lawsuits, with \nplaintiffs or defendants from states throughout the Nation, it is \nincreasingly difficult for this requirement of complete diversity to be \nmet.\n  In the system we have created, we see lawyers seeking out victims \ninstead of victims seeking out lawyers. We see lawsuits being \nadjudicated in a select few courts with proven track records for \ndelivering large verdicts instead of lawsuits being tried in courts \nwith the most appropriate jurisdiction.\n  S. 5 is a step in the right direction. It eliminates the lottery-like \naspect of civil liability that individuals now face by moving \ninterstate cases to the federal level. If passed, S. 5 makes it so that \nclass action cases involving citizens from Wyoming, Utah, Kansas and \nTexas will not be adjudicated at a courthouse in Madison County, \nIllinois. In the same vein, it ensures that cases involving folks from \nIllinois, Arkansas, and Mississippi are not decided in a State court in \nWyoming. These are interstate cases and should decided without a home \nstate bias that can exist in some State courts.\n  When the Founding Fathers drafted the Constitution and its provisions \nregarding the filing of interstate cases, they could never have \nimagined that our court system would be used someday to engage almost \nevery sector of the U.S. economy in just three counties. That statistic \nshould be a wake up call that something is dreadfully wrong and that \nthe system is not working as the designers intended. By placing cases \nin Federal court, we avoid the forum shopping that has become so \ncommonplace over the past few decades. S. 5 gives the defendants in a \nlawsuit a chance to have their day in an impartial court.\n  While State courts undoubtedly have their place, and in many \ninstances operate more effectively than Federal courts, a select few \nhave become notorious for delivering outrageous verdicts. Consequently, \nmany of our most costly class action lawsuits end up in these courts. \nThis should not be the case.\n  S. 5 will not only benefit the defendants, it will also make the \nsystem more fair for the plaintiffs. Weak oversight of class action \nlawsuits has created a system that returns less than 50 cents on the \ndollar to plaintiffs in a case. Compensation, when compared to actual \neconomic loss, is approximately 22 cents per dollar. Settlement \nnotifications are often times so confusing that plaintiffs do not \nunderstand what they are receiving. Plaintiffs are signing off on \nagreements they do not even understand, with even less understanding \nabout how to challenge the settlement. They are getting a raw deal.\n\n  I am pleased that the Class Action Fairness Act addresses this \nproblem by including a ``Consumer Class Action Bill of Rights.'' The \n``Bill of Rights'' includes a provision requiring the Federal court to \nhold a hearing and find that a settlement is fair before it can be \napproved. It includes provisions that make more fair what have become \nknown as ``coupon settlements,'' in which the attorneys receive real \nmoney and the victims receive the equivalent of a Sunday newspaper \nclipping.\n  S. 5 works to reign in the only people who covertly benefit from the \nway the class action system works today, a select group of defense \nattorneys who seem more interested in profits than process. These \nlawyers are more concerned with reaching a settlement than helping \ntheir victims. They push for quick class certification, and once they \nhave crossed that hurdle, they push for a quick settlement by \nthreatening the defendants with large monetary verdicts that have come \nabout in past cases.\n  In the face of these ridiculous verdicts, defendants settle quickly. \nThey know the stars are lined up against them if the case goes all the \nway to trial and often times, by agreeing to coupon settlements, the \ndefendants pay only a fraction of the stated damages. The Class Action \nFairness Act takes steps to change this practice. It takes steps to \nensure that when a settlement is reached, the lawyers and the \ndefendants do not come out ahead when the victims come out behind.\n  Is S. 5 perfect? Absolutely not. It does not require that individuals \nopt-in to class action lawsuits. It does not require sanctions be \nbrought against attorneys who file frivolous lawsuits over and over \nagain. There are a number of provisions that I believe should be \nincluded in the bill that did not make the cut.\n  But S. 5 is the true example of a bipartisan compromise. S. 5 takes \ninto account the wants of the various parties. It took a lot of give \nand take to get to this point, and now, we have a bill that does some \ngood. We have a bill that takes a first step toward reforming our court \nsystem to make it more fair for both the plaintiffs and the defendants.\n  I look forward to voting in favor of the Class Action Fairness Act \nlater today, and I will encourage all my colleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today on the final day of debate on \nthe class action reform bill to say a final word in support of the \nlegislation. We have worked for many years on this bill through \nnumerous hearings, committee markups and repeated floor consideration. \nWe can proudly say that we are about to succeed in passing modest, yet \nimportant changes to the class action process. Consumers and businesses \nacross the country will benefit and not a single case with merit will \ngo unheard.\n  Today is the culmination of many years of our bipartisan efforts on \nthis issue as we have attempted to make the class action system fairer \nfor both consumers and businesses alike. Our success once again \ndemonstrates that the Congress works best when we work together. I am \nmost proud that we were able to construct a bipartisan core of \nsupporters to pass this bill.\n  While this bill does not solve all of the problems in the system, \nconsumers will never again need to worry about being injured and \nreceiving worthless coupons as damages. Businesses will never again \nneed to fear being sued in a small county court where the rules are \nstacked against them. Most importantly, under our bill every claim with \nmerit will still go forward and the court house doors will always be \nopen.\n  It is a well-known saying that success has many fathers, so many will \ndeserve thanks for their work leading to the passage of this bill \ntoday. I would like to mention a few people specifically who have been \nindispensable to the passage of this legislation. Senator Grassley and \nI have worked on this bill for 7 years now. He has been a good partner \nand leader. He deserves tremendous credit for his willingness to accept \nbipartisan compromises in an effort to get this bill done.\n  Senators Carper and Hatch also deserve praise for the tremendous \nenergy that they have brought to this bill over the past two \nCongresses. Without them, class action reform certainly would not have \nmade it to the verge of passage today.\n  In addition, Senators Dodd, Feinstein, Schumer and Landrieu \ncontributed significantly in this process by making important changes \nto the bill. They were successful in identifying ways to ensure that \nprimarily State cases stayed in state court and only truly national \ncases could be removed to the Federal courts. This has been our goal \nall along. With their assistance we have accomplished it.\n  I would be remiss if I did not thank the many very fine staffers \nwhose work often goes unheralded. This bill addresses a very technical \nand difficult area of the law, so their contribution to this bill was \ntruly indispensable. All of the following were essential to the final \npassage of this bill: Rita Lari with Senator Grassley; Jonathon Jones, \nSheila Murphy and John Kilvington with Senator Carper; David Hantman \nwith Senator Feinstein; Jeff Berman with Senator Schumer; Shawn Maher \nwith Senator Dodd; and Harold Kim with Senator Hatch.\n  Finally, Paul Bock and Jeff Miller, my chief of staff and chief \ncounsel respectively, deserve significant credit for the passage of \nthis bill. They have worked tirelessly on this legislation for several \nyears and have provided wise counsel during the long and difficult \nnegotiations on this legislation. With their assistance, we succeeded \nin crafting a moderate bill that will help business and consumers \nalike. For that, we should all be proud.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Class Action \nFairness Act.\n  This legislation we are considering today is crucial to ensuring that \nthere\n\n[[Page S1239]]\n\nis fairness in our courtrooms, that claimants receive the judicial \nconsideration they deserve, and that the American economy and small \nbusinesses are able to stay competitive.\n  This class action reform legislation is primarily designed to allow \ndefendants to move a class action lawsuit from State court to Federal \ncourt when there is diversity or citizens from different States \ninvolved in the litigation. This concept is as old as our Republic. No \none will be denied access to the courts. It is simply allowing most \nlitigants to find the most appropriate court to decide the case. In \nsignificant cases with diversity, the Federal courts are the proper \nchoice.\n  We have heard about cases where lawyers shop around to find courts in \nparticular counties that have a proven track record of being \nsympathetic to class action lawsuits with absurdly large judgments. \nWhen justice arbitrarily hinges on what county in which a case is \ntried, that is not fair.\n  A recent study found that 89 percent of Americans believe the legal \nsystem is in need of reform. The statistics are indeed alarming: Over \nthe past decade, the number of class action lawsuits has increased by \nover 1,000 percent nationwide. And the cost of the U.S. tort system has \nincreased one hundred fold over the last 50 years. Lloyd's of London \nestimates that the tort system cost $205 billion in 2001, or $721 per \nU.S. citizen. Most importantly, Lloyd's estimates this number to rise \nto $298 billion by this year. At current levels, U.S. tort costs are \nequivalent to a five percent tax on wages.\n  The implications of an abused tort system on the American economy are \nof legitimate concern. While there is no doubt that many class action \nlawsuits are legitimate, the inadequacies of the system have resulted \nin frequent abuses. And the increased cost to businesses has an \nenormous impact--tying the hands of businesses and restricting their \nability to expand, provide additional jobs, or contribute to the \neconomy. Even the threat of class action lawsuits forces businesses to \nspend millions of dollars. Defendants face the risk of a single \njudgment in the tens of millions or even billions of dollars, simply \nbecause a State court judge has rushed to certify a class without \nproper review. The risk of a single, bankrupting award often forces \ndefendants to settle the case with sizable payments even when the \ndefendant has meritorious defenses.\n  Believe it or not, some opponents of the Class Action Fairness Act \nare still urging that the current class action system works well and \nthat class action reform is unnecessary. Apparently, they do not think \nit is a problem when consumers take home 50-cent coupons to compensate \nthem for their injuries, while their lawyers pocket millions in cash. \nTake for example a case against Blockbuster, Inc., where customers \nalleged they were charged excessive late fees for video rentals. These \ncustomers received $1 coupons while their attorneys received over $9 \nmillion. Or when one State court prevents citizens from litigating \ntheir claims under the law of their home State. Or when attorneys file \nthe same lawsuit in dozens of State courts across the country and file \nthe same lawsuit in a race to see which judge will certify the fastest \nand broadest class.\n  In fact, numerous studies have documented class action abuses taking \nplace in a small number of ``magnet'' State courts, and by now, it is \nbeyond legitimate debate that our class action system is in shambles. \nAs the Washington Post editorial page has noted, ``[n]o portion of the \nAmerican civil justice system is more of a mess than the world of class \naction.''\n  A RAND Institute for Civil Justice, ICJ, Study on U.S. class actions \nreleased at the end of 1999 empirically confirms what has long been \nwidely believed--State court consumer class actions primarily benefit \nlawyers, not the consumers on whose behalf the actions ostensibly are \nbrought. Case studies in the ICJ piece confirm that in State court \nconsumer class actions--that is, cases not involving personal injury \nclaims--the fees received by attorneys are typically larger than the \ntotal amount of monetary benefits paid to all of the class members \ncombined. In short, the lawyers are the primary beneficiaries. The ICJ \nStudy contains no data indicating that this problem exists in Federal \ncourt class actions.\n  If we do not pass this vital legislation, the class action process \nwill remain a system ripe for exploitation, and the harm to the \nfundamental fairness of the civil justice system will continue to grow. \nExcessive and frivolous class action lawsuits stifle innovation, \ndiscourage risk-taking, and harm the entrepreneurship that drives our \nNation's economic growth and job creation.\n  This commonsense, bipartisan legislation will help alleviate the \ndramatic effects that have resulted from an abuse of the class action \nsystem. This legislation ensures that legitimate class action cases are \ngiven full consideration and that prevailing plaintiffs receive the \ncompensation they deserve. Americans deserve to have a judicial system \nthat is effective and efficient, and, most importantly, fair--this \nlegislation goes a long way toward accomplishing these objectives. I \nurge my colleagues to support this legislation. In the 108th Congress, \nthis legislation came up one vote short. We now have four more Senators \non our side of the aisle, so I am confident in its success in the 109th \nCongress. This is a success that people in States desire, and it will \nbe a promise kept.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I oppose this legislation called the \nClass Action Fairness Act of 2005, because I do not believe it is fair \nto litigants who have legitimate claims that are most appropriately \naddressed by our state courts.\n  Yes, there are some problems in the use of class actions, and in some \ncases there are excessive fees or inappropriate coupon settlements. I \nam pleased that after many years of seeking to move class action \n``reform'' legislation, the bill proponents finally agreed to include \nlanguage that addresses some of the abuses concerning ``coupon'' \nsettlements, in which plaintiffs who have proven their case in court \nreceive in turn coupons for products or services that have little \nvalue. This language has long been advocated by the distinguished \nranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Leahy, and it \nis a good provision because in contrast to most of the bill, it is \nnarrowly crafted to address an actual problem that the legal system and \nlitigants confront.\n  But the vast majority of the provisions in this legislation are not \nnarrowly crafted to address discrete problems. Instead, this \nlegislation is an extremely blunt instrument that I believe will result \nin justice delayed and justice denied for many Americans.\n  There have been many claims about ``judicial hellholes'' and ``magnet \njurisdictions'' but the evidence shows that these claims are, at best, \noverstated, and are certainly not so widespread so as to justify \npassage of this legislation that turns 200 years of federalism on its \nhead. Indeed, a recent report by Public Citizen found that there were, \nat most, two jurisdictions--Madison County and St. Clair County, IL--of \nthe 3,141 court systems in the United States for which bill proponents \nhave provided limited data that they are ``magnet jurisdictions.'' As \nto Madison County in particular, the facts also do not support the \nrhetoric. In 2002, only 3 of 77 class actions were actually certified \nto proceed to trial, and in 2003, only 2 of 106 class actions filed \nwere certified.\n  Moreover, the Public Citizen report notes that, in recent years, at \nleast 11 states have made major changes to the class action process \nused in their States to aid in the administering of justice, and in \nfact Illinois is in the process of doing the same.\n  The legislation purports to help Americans but I believe it will hurt \nthem. The legislation itself states its purpose is to: ``(1) assure \nfair and prompt recoveries for class members with legitimate claims; \n(2) restore the intent of the framers of the United States Constitution \nby providing for Federal court consideration of interstate cases of \nnational importance under diversity jurisdiction; and (3) benefit \nsociety by encouraging innovation and lowering consumer prices.''\n  As to assuring ``fair and prompt recoveries,'' hundreds of consumer \nrights, labor, civil rights, senior, and environmental organizations, \nesteemed legal experts, and many State Attorneys General believe, as I \ndo, that this legislation will do just the opposite.\n  There is also no reasonable basis for the assertion that this \nlegislation ``will\n\n[[Page S1240]]\n\nrestore the intent of the framers'' with respect to the role of our \nfederal courts. As Arthur Miller, the distinguished Harvard Law School \nprofessor, author, and expert in the fields of civil procedure, complex \nlitigation, and class actions noted with respect to similar legislation \nconsidered last year: it is a ``radical departure from one of the most \nbasic, longstanding principles of federalism [and] is a particular \naffront to state judges when we consider the unquestioned vitality and \ncompetence of state courts to which we have historically and frequently \nentrusted the enforcement of state-created rights and remedies.''\n  As a Senator representing the great State of New York, I have worked \nclosely with many businesses in my state to help them with their \nefforts to grow and create jobs, and I am a firm believer in \nencouraging innovation and lowering consumer prices. But even if we \nassume there is a strong connection between this legislation and those \ngoals, there are many more appropriate means to achieve those ends \nwithout doing the harm to the administration of justice that I believe \nthis legislation will impose.\n  In addition to being unfair to the American people, I do not believe \nthis legislation is fair to our State or Federal judiciaries. This bill \nwill effectively preclude state courts in many instances from employing \ntheir expertise and experience in class action cases based on state law \nthat they have historically considered. I believe that state courts \nshould determine matters of state law whenever possible. It is not fair \nto our Federal judiciary, which simply does not have the resources or \nexperience to handle a mass influx of class action cases to our federal \ncourts.\n\n  Indeed, the Judicial Conference of the United States has expressed \nits opposition to similar legislation introduced in prior Congresses \nbecause it ``would add substantially to the workload of the federal \ncourts and [is] inconsistent with principles of federalism.'' \nSimilarly, the Board of Directors of the Conference of Chief Justices \nrepresenting the Chief Justices of our state courts has said that \nlegislation of this kind is simply unwarranted ``absent hard evidence \nof the inability of the state judicial systems to hear and decide \nfairly class actions brought in state courts.'' That evidence simply \ndoes not exist.\n  As the National Conference of State Legislatures, NCSL, has noted in \nits strong opposition to this legislation, the legislation ``sends a \ndisturbing message to the American people that state court systems are \nsomehow inferior or untrustworthy.'' The NCSL went on to say that the \neffect of the legislation ``on state legislatures is that state laws in \nthe areas of consumer protection and antitrust, which were passed to \nprotect the citizens of a particular state against fraudulent or \nillegal activities, will almost never be heard in state courts. \nIronically, state courts, whose sole purpose is to interpret state \nlaws, will be bypassed and the federal judiciary will be asked to \nrender judgment in those cases.''\n  Although bill proponents have sometimes suggested the contrary, make \nno mistake: if enacted, this legislation will not only result in the \nmajority of class action lawsuits being transferred from our state to \nFederal courts, but it will also serve to terminate some class action \nlawsuits that seek to provide justice to everyday Americans.\n  Proponents of this legislation refer to an alleged abuse by lawyers \nin bringing class actions and assert that too many cases are instituted \nthat are without merit. As I have already noted, I believe some \nproponents of this legislation have mischaracterized the extent of the \nproblems concerning class actions. But, even if these assertions were \ntrue, the proponents have failed to justify the rejection of the very \nreasonable amendments offered by my colleagues that sought to address \nmajor concerns with the legislation without undermining its spirit or \nintent.\n  One such amendment was offered by my colleague Senator Pryor of \nArkansas, a former Arkansas State Attorney General. It would have \nclarified the role that State Attorneys General would continue to play \nin State class action cases. That amendment had the express written \nsupport of 47 of the 50 State Attorneys General in our Nation. As the \nhighest law enforcement officers in their respective States, I cannot \nimagine that anyone in this body would believe that such public \nservants would bring ``frivolous lawsuits'' or would seek to abuse the \nclass action process. And yet, that amendment failed, primarily along \nparty lines.\n  The remaining amendments met a similar fate, including one offered by \nSenators Bingaman and Feinstein. There is no general Federal consumer \nprotection statute, which is why consumer fraud, deceptive sales \npractices, and defective product cases are almost always commenced in \nstate courts.\n  Yet, the legislation before us would effectively move many of these \ncases to Federal courts, courts that are already overburdened and have \nneither the experience nor the expertise to handle these cases. If such \ncases are forced into Federal courts through consolidation of many \nstate court cases, a Federal court hearing such a case must then decide \nwhich state laws should be applied. Because these kinds of \ncircumstances have presented enormous challenges to our Federal courts, \nmany Federal judges have simply, and understandably, denied \ncertification of nationwide consumer fraud cases. Yet, the bill \nlanguage would preclude the consideration of many of these cases in \nstate courts, creating what many have described as the bill's ``Catch-\n22.'' At that point, such cases would literally be in justice ``limbo'' \nbecause a federal court would have dismissed the case but under the \nprovisions of the legislation, the case could not withstand a \ndefendant's challenge to maintain the case in a State court.\n  The amendment offered by Senator Feinstein, an original cosponsor of \nthe underlying legislation, and Senator Bingaman, would have provided a \nprocess to handle such cases to increase the likelihood that such cases \nwould be certified by a Federal court and the appropriate State laws \nwould be applied. This was a more than reasonable effort to address a \nsignificant concern with this legislation without undermining the \nlegislation's intent to transfer many class actions to Federal courts. \nBut, once again, a majority of the Members of this body chose to reject \nit.\n  The Leadership Conference on Civil Rights has stated, and no one has \nrefuted, that ``there is no evidence that lawsuits brought by workers \nseeking justice in state courts on issues ranging from overtime pay to \nworking off the clock are abusing the system. To the contrary, failure \nto exempt such lawsuits in this legislation is an abusive act against \nevery hard-working American seeking fair pay and a better life.'' Yet, \nthe amendment offered by Senator Kennedy that would have carved out \nsuch cases from this legislation was rejected as well.\n  In short, this bill currently stands now in the same shape as when it \nwas introduced. Though valiant efforts were made to improve it, none \nwere successful. Eliot Spitzer, the distinguished New York State \nAttorney General, and a number of other State Attorneys General, \nexpressed their overall concern with the bill, including the fact that \nthe legislation still ``unduly limits the right of individuals to seek \nredress for corporate wrongdoing in their state courts.'' I could not \nagree more.\n  In speaking in opposition to this legislation on the Senate floor \nearlier this week, Senator Leahy, the Ranking Member of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, reminded all of my colleagues that sometimes \nindividual claims are so small that even though a harm was done for \nwhich a plaintiff should receive relief, it is not worth it for him or \nher to spend significant financial resources to obtain that relief \nthrough the judicial process. Unfortunately, as he said, ``[s]ometimes \nthat is what cheaters count on, and it is how they get away with their \nschemes. [Yet,] cheating thousands of people is still cheating. Class \nactions allow the little guys to band together, allow them to afford a \ncompetent lawyer, and allow them to redress wrongdoing.'' With the \nexpected passage of this legislation today, I believe the ``little \nguy'' loses, and I believe that is neither fair nor just. That is why I \ncannot support this legislation.\n  I appreciate the concerns raised by businesses in New York and around \nthe country about the cost of litigation. I too believe that litigation \ncosts have increased significantly. Any legislation that seeks to \naddress discrete problems with class action litigation should address \nthis and other concerns without\n\n[[Page S1241]]\n\nunnecessarily and negatively affecting the ability of Americans to seek \nand obtain justice through our courts. A proper balance must be struck. \nThe so-called Class Action Fairness Act simply does not strike that \nbalance.\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Class Action \nFairness Act of 2005, legislation that is greatly needed to restore \npublic confidence in our Nation's judicial system and protect jobs in \nmy own State and throughout the country.\n  Frivolous litigation has helped drive the total cost of our tort \nsystem to more than $230 billion a year. Tort costs in America are now \nfar higher than those of any other major industrialized nation, and in \nour global economy, this has become a tremendous disadvantage for \nAmerican manufacturers and entrepreneurs, who have long sought reform. \nBut this affects not just certain businesses; this affects our overall \neconomy and all Americans.\n  The Class Action Fairness Act will provide that some class action \nsuits be litigated in the Federal courts rather than allowing venue \nshopping for a sympathetic State court. The measure will also ensure \nthat cases of national importance are not overlooked. Most importantly, \nthis legislation will ensure that class members with legitimate claims \nare fairly compensated.\n  Class action suits are an important part of our legal system. They \noriginated to make our courts more efficient by joining together \nparties with a common claim. However, growing abuses by opportunistic \nplaintiffs' attorneys--coupled with the skyrocketing costs of runaway \nlitigation and excessive awards--have had a dramatic impact on \nAmerica's interstate commerce.\n  Over the past decade, the number of class action lawsuits has grown \nby over 1,000 percent nationwide. And the jury awards are sharply \nincreasing over time as well. In 1999, the top 10 awards totaled $9 \nbillion; by 2002, that number had jumped to $32.7 billion.\n  Businesses, like those in my home State of North Carolina, are losing \nout because the rules in place today allow lawyers to ``shop'' for the \n``friendliest'' court to hear their case. And it is not just large \ncompanies being sacked with enormous payouts in class action lawsuits. \nSmall businesses are bearing the majority of tort liability costs. \nAccording to a study conducted for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, small \nbusinesses bear 68 percent of tort liability costs but take in just 25 \npercent of business revenue.\n  We all know that small businesses are the job creators and the \nengines of our economy. They create 70 percent of all new jobs in \nAmerica. Yet the rules in place today allow for a judicial system that \nis truly hurting them and causing them to spend money--on average \n$150,000 a year--on litigation expenses rather than on business \ndevelopment and equipment and expansion--the very things that can lead \nto more jobs.\n  Our goal in reforming class action lawsuits is to provide justice to \nthe truly injured parties, not to deny victims their day in court and \ntheir just compensation. Lawsuit costs have risen substantially over \nthe past several decades, and a significant part of these costs is \ngoing towards paying exorbitant lawyers' fees and transaction costs. \nAnd some injured plaintiffs are suffering because of weak State court \noversight of class action cases. In fact, under the current U.S. tort \nsystem, less than 50 cents on the dollar finds its way to claimants, \nand only 22 cents compensate for actual economic loss.\n  And sometimes class members don't receive cash at all. For example, \nin a settlement with Crayola, approved by a State court in Illinois, \ncrayon purchasers in North Carolina and around the country received 75-\ncent coupons for the purchase of more crayons; their lawyers, however, \nreceived $600,000 in cash.\n  And in the Cheerios class action settlement, also approved by State \ncourt in Illinois, consumers in North Carolina and around the country \nreceived coupons for buying a single box of cereal, while lawyers got \n$1.75 million.\n  I hardly think it's in the best interest of the class member to \nactually have to purchase more of a product to receive any benefit. And \nit isn't fair that class members are losing out while their attorneys \nare cashing in.\n  This legislation establishes a ``Consumer Class Action Bill of \nRights'' that will ensure that class actions do not harm the intended \nbeneficiaries--people who were actually harmed by the actions of a \ndefendant. And it does nothing to prevent class members from having \ntheir cases heard--it just establishes that some of these cases may be \nheard in Federal courts.\n  It is time we do what is right and repair this broken system--for \nclaimants in class action cases, for our Nation's economy, businesses \nlarge and small, and for all Americans.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of the \nClass Action Fairness Act, a bill to stop unfair and abusive class \naction lawsuits that ignore the best interests of injured plaintiffs. \nThis legislation is sorely needed to help people understand their \nrights in class action lawsuits and protect them from unfair \nsettlements.\n  It is also needed to reform the class action process, which has been \nso manipulated in recent years that U.S. companies are being driven \ninto bankruptcy to escape the rising tide of frivolous lawsuits and has \nresulted in the loss of thousands of jobs, especially in the \nmanufacturing sector.\n  Unfortunately, not enough Americans realize that we are in a global \nmarketplace and businesses now have choices as to where they \nmanufacture their products. Many of our businesses are leaving our \ncountry because of the litigation tornado that is destroying their \ncompetitiveness. The Senate must start taking into consideration the \nimpact of its decisions on this Nation's competitive position in the \nglobal marketplace.\n  I believe that for the system to work, we must strike a delicate \nbalance between the rights of aggrieved parties to bring lawsuits and \nthe rights of society to be protected against frivolous lawsuits and \noutrageous judgments that are disproportionate to compensating the \ninjured and made at the expense of society as a whole. This is what the \nClass Action Fairness Act, does, and I am proud to cosponsor it.\n  Since my days as Governor of Ohio, I have been very concerned with \nwhat I call the ``litigation tornado'' that has been sweeping through \nthe economy of Ohio, as well as the Nation.\n  Ohio's civil justice system is in a state of crisis. Ohio doctors are \nleaving the State and too many have stopped delivering babies because \nthey can't afford the liability insurance.\n  From 2001-02, Ohio physicians faced medical liability insurance \nincreases ranging from 28 to 60 percent. Ohio ranked among the top five \nStates for premium increases in 2002. General surgeons pay as much as \n$74,554, and OB-GYNs pay as much as $152,496. Comparatively, Indiana \ngeneral surgeons pay between $14,000-$30,000; and OB-GYNs pay between \n$20,000-$40,000.\n  Further, Ohio businesses are going bankrupt as a result of runaway \nasbestos litigation. And today, one of my fellow Ohioans can be a \nplaintiff in a class action lawsuit that she doesn't know about and \ntaking place in a State she has never even visited.\n  In 1996, as Governor of Ohio, I was proud to sign H.B. 350, strong \ntort reform legislation that became law in Ohio for a while. It might \nhave helped today's liability crisis, but it never got a chance.\n  In 1999, the Supreme Court of Ohio, in a politically motivated 4-3 \ndecision, struck down Ohio's civil justice reform law, even though the \nonly plaintiff in the case was the Ohio Academy of Trial Lawyers--the \npersonal injury bar's trade group.\n  Their reason for challenging the law? They claimed their association \nwould lose members and lose money due to the civil justice reform laws \nwe enacted.\n  The bias of the case was so great that one of the dissenters, Justice \nStratton, had this to say:\n\n       This case should have never been accepted for review on the \n     merits. The majority's acceptance of this case means that we \n     have created a whole new arena of jurisdiction--advisory \n     opinions on the constitutionality of a statute challenged by \n     a special interest group.\n\n  From this, it is obvious to me that the way we currently administer \nclass actions is not working.\n  While we were frustrated at the State level, I'm proud to have \ncontinued my fight for a fair, strong civil justice system in the \nUnited States Senate.\n\n[[Page S1242]]\n\n  To this end, a few years ago I worked with the American Tort Reform \nAssociation to produce a study entitled ``Lawsuit Abuse and Ohio'' that \ncaptured the impact of this rampant litigation on Ohio's economy, with \nthe goal of educating the public on this issue and sparking change.\n  Can you imagine what this study found? In 2002 in Ohio, the \nlitigation crisis costs every Ohioan $636 per year, and every Ohio \nfamily of four $2,544 per year. These are alarming numbers. And this \nstudy was released on August 8, 2002--imagine how high these numbers \nhave risen in 2\\1/2\\ years.\n  In tough economic times, families can not afford to pay over $2,500 \nto cover other people's litigation costs. Something needs to be done, \nand passage of this bill will help!\n  Mr. President, this legislation is intended to amend the federal \njudicial code to streamline and curb abuse of class action lawsuits, a \nprocedural device through which people with identical claims are \npermitted to merge them and be heard at one time in court.\n  In particular, this legislation contains safeguards that provide for \njudicial scrutiny of the terms of class action settlements in order to \neliminate unfair and discriminatory distribution of awards for damages \nand prevent class members from suffering a net loss as a result of a \ncourt victory.\n  This bill would establish a concept of diversity jurisdiction that \nwould allow the largest interstate class actions into Federal court, \nwhile preserving exclusive State court control over smaller, primarily \nintrastate disputes. As several major newspaper editorial boards--\nranging from the Post to the Wall Street Journal--have recognized, \nenactment of such legislation would go a long way toward curbing \nunfairness in certain state court class actions and restoring faith in \nthe fairness and integrity of the judicial process.\n  This bill is designed to improve the handling of massive U.S. class \naction lawsuits while preserving the rights of citizens to bring such \nactions.\n  Class action lawsuits have spiraled out of control, with the threat \nof large, overreaching verdicts holding corporations hostage for years \nand years.\n  In total, America's civil justice system had a direct cost to tax \npayers in 2002 of $233.4 billion, or 2.23 percent of GDP. That is $809 \nper citizen and equivalent to a 5 percent wage tax. That's a 13.3 \npercent jump from the year before--a year when we experienced a 14.4 \npercent increase which was the largest percentage increase since 1986.\n  Now, some of my colleagues have argued that this bill sends most \nstate class actions into Federal court and deprives state courts of the \npower to adjudicate cases involving their own laws. They argue that the \nbill therefore infringes upon States' sovereignty.\n  However, in one empirical study done by two attorneys from O'Melveny \n& Myers, their data indicated that this bill would not sweep all class \nactions into Federal court. Rather, the bill is a targeted solution \nthat could result in moving to Federal court a substantial percentage \nof the nationwide or multi-State class actions filed in class action \n``mill'' jurisdictions (like Madison County, IL), while allowing State \ncourts everywhere to litigate truly local class actions (the kinds of \nclass actions typically filed in State courts that do not endeavor to \nbecome ``magnet'' courts for class actions with little or no \nrelationship to the forum).\n  There is just no evidence for the assertion that this bill deprives \nState courts of their power to hear cases involving their own laws. In \nfact, it is the present system that infringes upon state sovereignty \nrights by promoting a ``false federalism'' whereby some state courts \nare able to impose their decisions on citizens of other States \nregardless of their own laws.\n  Another argument against this bill is that it will unduly expand \nFederal diversity jurisdiction at a time when courts are overcrowded. \nHowever, State courts have experienced a much more dramatic increase in \nclass action filings and have not proven to be any more efficient in \nprocessing complex cases.\n  In addition, Federal courts have greater resources to handle the most \ncomplex, interstate class action litigation, and are insulated from the \nlocal prejudice problems so prevalent under current rules.\n  Mr. President, I emphasize to my colleagues that this isn't a bill to \nend all class action lawsuits. It's a bill to identify those lawsuits \nwith merit and to ensure that the plaintiffs in legitimate lawsuits are \ntreated fairly throughout the litigation process.\n  It's a bill to protect class members from settlements that give their \nlawyers millions, while they only see pennies. It's a bill to rectify \nthe fact that over the past decade, State court class action filings \nincreased over 1,000 percent. It's a bill to fix a broken judicial \nsystem.\n  I am a strong supporter of this bill, and I urge my colleagues to do \nthe same.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am pleased to support S. 5, the Class \nAction Fairness Act of 2005.\n  I believe there are problems with our current class action system \nthat should be addressed through Congressional action. These problems \ninclude:\n  Cases and controversies that are national in scope and are currently \nbeing decided in State courts;\n  Decisions or settlements that are determined in one State's court \nsystem, are being applied nationwide, and conflict with laws in other \nStates; and\n  Plaintiffs receiving little compensation, or in the most extreme \nexample, actually owing money from the settlement of a class action \nlawsuit.\n  Class action lawsuits serve a useful purpose in our judicial system. \nClass actions allow individuals to merge a number of similar claims \ninto one lawsuit, which can be an efficient use of judicial resources. \nClass action lawsuits enable individuals with small claims the ability \nto seek justice.\n  The legislation we are considering today will fairly determine \nwhether a class action should be considered in a State court or a \nFederal court. Thus, the legislation will help ensure that issues that \nare national in scope are heard in federal court, while issues that are \nlocal in nature are heard in State courts.\n  The Class Action Fairness Act also provides some common sense reforms \nand oversight of the class action settlement process. These changes \nwill help ensure that individuals who should be compensated receive \nfair compensation for their injuries, rather than worthless coupons, or \nactually owing money.\n  I cannot, and would not, support legislation that denies individuals \ntheir ability to pursue compensation in the legal system for damages \nthey have suffered. The legislation before this body is a bipartisan \ncompromise worked out over many years. It does not deny individuals \ntheir right to pursue justice through the legal system. Because I \nbelieve the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 fairly addresses the \nproblems in our class action system, I will support its passage today.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to speak about S. 5, the Class Action \nFairness Act.\n  First and foremost, I want to commend both the Republican and \nDemocratic Leaders for all the work they did to bring this bill before \nthe Senate. In particular, I am pleased that the consent agreement \nallowed all relevant amendments to be offered and debated.\n  I believe many of these amendments would have improved the underlying \nlegislation without threatening its reforms. In particular, I think we \nshould have adopted the Feinstein-Bingaman amendment, which would have \ngiven federal judges clear guidance about how to apply state consumer \nlaws in multi-state class action lawsuits. This would have permitted \nmore multi-state consumer class actions to be certified in federal \ncourt and resolved on their merits.\n  After S. 5 is enacted into law, I believe we should rapidly revisit \nthis issue and make sure that consumers are actually getting their day \nin court and not having their class action cases thrown out because \nFederal courts are deeming them too complex or unmanageable to certify.\n  That being said, I think this legislation benefited greatly from the \nnegotiations entered into by Senators Dodd, Landrieu and Schumer with \nthe bill's major sponsors, Senators Grassley, Kohl, Hatch and Carper. \nAlthough S. 5 is not the bill I would have written, I do think it will \naddress some of the well-documented problems created by overlapping \nclass actions in State and Federal courts.\n\n[[Page S1243]]\n\n  In particular, the Dodd-Landrieu-Schumer language included in S. 5 \naddressed some of my biggest concerns about moving class actions to \nFederal court. Many class actions involve only State law issues, are \nbrought by plaintiffs from the same geographical area and have a \ndefendant who is based within that same community. Moving these cases \nto Federal court is inappropriate, especially if they do not involve \nissues of national importance. In many cases, it is our State judges \nwho are in the best position to make determinations about State law. \nThe Dodd-Landrieu-Schumer compromise created a new exception for \nkeeping cases like this in State court. Under the bill, if two-thirds \nof the plaintiffs are from a given State, the injury happened in that \nState and at least one significant defendant is from that same State, \nthen the class action can remain in State court. As a result, I believe \nS. 5 ensures that ``nationwide'' class actions are separated from those \nthat should continue to be heard in State courts.\n  I also believe that any attempt to stop forum shopping by plaintiffs \nshould minimize forum shopping by defendants. The Dodd-Landrieu-Schumer \ncompromise in S. 5 addressed this issue by making it clear that there \nis a firm 30-day deadline for the removal of nationwide class actions \nto Federal court once the plaintiffs have filed papers that create \nconditions for removal.\n  I also am pleased that the Dodd-Landrieu-Schumer compromise dealt \nwith one of the most serious abuses in class action cases, certain \ntypes of collusive coupon settlements. S. 5 clarified that if a \nsettlement provides coupons as a remedy, attorneys' fees will only be \npaid in proportion to the redemption of the coupons. A provision like \nthis does not prohibit coupon settlements, but practically speaking, \nattorneys will not agree to such settlements unless the coupons are \nactually valuable. S. 5 also requires that a judge may not approve a \ncoupon settlement until a hearing is conducted to determine if the \nsettlement terms are fair, reasonable, and adequate for class members.\n  Finally, I believed that is important to preserve the ability of the \nAdvisory Committee on the Federal Rules, the U.S. Judicial Conference, \nand the Supreme Court to amend the class action rules or procedures to \nthe extent necessary to accomplish their purposes more effectively or \nto cure any unanticipated problems. S. 5 also included a provision \nsaying that the Federal courts could make such changes as appropriate.\n  As a result of all of these improvements, I believe S. 5 is \nlegislation that addresses serious problems in our nation's class \naction system and will make the system fairer for both plaintiffs and \ndefendants.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty minutes is to be equally divided \nbetween the chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I commend the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom Illinois. He is absolutely right. You have the corporate \ninterests, and this administration is closing courthouse doors--one of \nthe few places where people can go that are not aligned with either the \nRepublican or the Democratic Party; a place where they don't need any \npolitical clout; a place where somebody can't say they are going to \ncontribute heavily to a political party so their interests will be \nheard, or something like that. There is one place they could go--\nwhether they are a mechanic, a bus driver, a person raising a family, \nsomebody who had been damaged by a product sold when the manufacturer \nknew of the flaw--the one place they could go would be the courthouse. \nThey are not the rich, powerful, or well-connected. They could win. Or \nat least seek justice. We are going to close that door, too.\n  Over the few days that the Senate has been considering this bill, \nthere have been a few modest amendments that might actually keep the \ndoor open a tiny crack for the people who need it. There have been \nserious concerns raised by the National Conference of State \nLegislatures of our 50 States, the National Association of State \nAttorneys General, prominent legal scholars, consumers, environmental \ngroups, and civil rights organizations. They asked us to at least \nconsider a few improvements but the courthouse door was slammed shut. \nThe Senate's door was slammed shut.\n  For anybody watching this debate, they have figured out that by now \nthe fix was in, despite these legitimate concerns.\n  After 31 years here I am disappointed that the Senate is now taking \nits marching orders for major legislation from corporate special \ninterests and the White House.\n  We could have actually acted as an independent body and made some \nchanges in this bill. Instead, we are saying--the 100 of us--to all 50 \nof the State legislatures that we know better than they do, that they \nare irrelevant, that we could close them off.\n  It is going to make it harder for American citizens to protect \nthemselves against violation of State civil rights, consumer, health, \nenvironmental protection laws, to take these cases to State court.\n  Aside from being convenient, plaintiffs actually know where the local \nstate courthouse is. These courthouses have experience with the legal \nand factual issues within their States. We are simply going to sweep \nthese cases into Federal court, after we have already swept so much \ncriminal jurisdiction there, and you can't get a civil case heard \nanyway. We are erecting barriers to lawsuits, and we are placing new \nburdens on plaintiffs. They will languish.\n  The bill contains language that would reduce the delay that parties \ncan experience when a case is removed to Federal court by setting a \nlimit for appeals of remand orders. But we don't say anything about how \nlong the court can sit on the remand motion. They could sit on it for \n10 years if they want to before they do a thing. Plaintiffs can die, \nwitnesses can move away, memories could grow dim, and nothing happens.\n  Senator Feingold offered a modest amendment to set a reasonable time \nfor action on remand motions. The solution received praise from one of \nthe sponsors of this legislation, but the corporate masters and the \nWhite House said no. So it was rejected by the Senate.\n  The biggest concern raised by legal scholars and agreed to by several \nSenate sponsors of the bill would address the recent trend in Federal \ncourts not to certify class actions if multiple state laws are \ninvolved.\n  The way this is set up in the bill--a lot of the business groups are \nbehind this--one could easily get a case dismissed by a Federal court.\n  Senator Feinstein and Senator Bingaman worked together to alleviate \nwhat was a legal Catch-22. The Federal court says if a case has \ncomplicated State laws in it, it can't hear it. But you can't bring it \nin State court either. The Federal court says the State laws are \ncomplicated and it should have been heard in the State court. But under \nthis bill, it goes to the Federal court so, of course, the corporate \ninterests win. We tried to change that.\n  Cynics might even speculate that is what the business groups behind \nthis purported ``procedural'' change are really seeking, the dismissal \nof meritorious cases on procedural grounds by the federal courts. \nNaturally, the orders came down from the corporate masters and the \nWhite House: Don't do it. We love the way this is going to allow us to \nkeep things out of court. There it goes.\n  Anyone who reads this bill will notice that despite its title, it \naffects more than just class actions. Individual actions, consolidated \nby state courts for efficiency purposes, are not class actions. Despite \nthe fact that a similar provision was unanimously struck from the bill \nduring the last Congress, mass actions reappeared in this bill this \nCongress. Federalizing these individual cases will no doubt delay, and \npossibly deny, justice for victims suffering real injuries. Senator \nDurbin's amendment sought to clarify the bill's effect on these cases. \nI'm glad the debate this week served to clarify the narrow scope of \nthis provision.\n  It is interesting because a similar provision to was unanimously \nstruck from the bill during the last Congress--unanimously but that \nwasn't good enough for the corporate masters. It was slipped back into \nthe bill this Congress.\n\n[[Page S1244]]\n\n  Class action legislation had been criticized by nearly all of the \nState attorneys general in this country, Republicans and Democrats \nalike. The distinguished former attorney general, Senator Pryor of \nArkansas, had a concern that S. 5 would limit their official powers to \ninvestigate and bring actions in State courts against defendants. He \nwanted to put in minor clarifications to show they could do that. \nAlthough these attorneys general contacted their Senators--Republicans \nand Democrats alike--they were tossed out.\n  Senator Kennedy's amendment to exempt civil rights, and wage and hour \ncases in the bill, was a sensible solution. Prominent civil rights \norganizations and labor advocates requested that the bill be modified \nto acknowledge the fact that many of our states have their own \nprotective civil rights and employment laws. I was proud to cosponsor \nit and regret that with the fix being in, this amendment was rejected \nby the Senate. But the fix was in, and that is out.\n  What we have done here? I will give you an example of one class \naction suit that would have been impacted under this legislation--Brown \nv. Board of Education, finally ending segregation in our schools, a \nblight on the American conscience. And how did Brown v. Board of \nEducation get to the Supreme Court? Not from the three Federal courts \nin that class action suit; not the three Federal courts that said \n``separate but equal'' is the law of the land. It had been good enough \nfor all of us. Send those African-American children to one school. Send \nthe White kids to a much better school--because that is what it was. \nThe view was that is good enough for us, always been that way.\n  Only one State court in the State of Delaware said: That might be \nwhat the U.S. Supreme Court said, but they are wrong. They are wrong. \nWe don't believe in Plessy v. Ferguson. We don't believe in the \nseparate but equal. We say sending Black children to one school and \nWhite kids to the other is not equal. We are making second-class \ncitizens of these African Americans.\n  And because a State court heard and ruled on that class action, it \nwent up to the U.S. Supreme Court, and the U.S. Supreme Court \nunanimously came down with Brown v. Board of Education.\n  We pray there is not some class of people in this country being \ndamaged the way African-American children were being damaged at that \ntime because if they go into the courts in the wake of this \nlegislation, the fix is in, this Senate has closed the court doors to \nthem, this White House has closed the court doors to them, these \ncorporate interests have closed the court doors to them. It is a shame. \nIt is wrong. It is one heck of a message to send to this country.\n  It is disappointing to me that the Senate has refused to listen to \nwise counsel of our state legislatures, our state law enforcement \nofficers, our state judges and even the views expressed by our federal \njudiciary since they are the institutions that we are affecting by \nenacting this legislation.\n  I predict this legislation will be manipulated by well-paid corporate \ndefense lawyers to create complex, expensive and lengthy litigation \nover the criteria and factors in the bill and whether they apply to a \nparticular case. Unfortunately, one of the great boons of this \nlegislation, to the extent it does not simply deter class actions \nbrought by consumers, is that it will make them more costly, burdensome \nand complicated.\n  The so-called Class Action Fairness Act falls short of the \nexpectation set by its title. It will leave many injured parties who \nhave valid claims with no avenue for relief, and that is anything but \nfair to the ordinary Americans who look to us to represent them in the \nUnited States Senate.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for moving this \nbill through to final conclusion where we are now scheduled to vote on \nfinal passage at 3 o'clock this afternoon.\n  We took this bill up in the Judiciary Committee a week ago today. \nAlthough there was some conjecture we could not pass the bill out of \ncommittee, in the morning we did so. We started the floor debate Monday \nafternoon. I led off in my capacity as chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee. We had a number of amendments and we have worked the will of \nthe Senate. A number of amendments have been withdrawn, a number of \namendments have been defeated.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin, Senator Feingold, offered an amendment \nwhich would have imposed time limitations on the courts on their \nhandling of class action cases. I told him I thought it was a good \nidea, but I was constrained to vote against it because we have an \nunderstanding--implicit or explicit, I am not quite sure which because \nI was not party to it--with the House of Representatives that if we \nsent them a so-called clean bill without amendments, they would accept \nthe Senate version. I told Senator Feingold as to his issue, I have had \na number of complaints about delays in the administration of the \ncourts. That is something the Judiciary Committee will take up.\n  I make it plain we will not deal with judicial independence or the \ncourt's discretionary functions, but when it comes to delays, that is a \nmatter of congressional oversight on our fundamental responsibility to \ndecide how many judges there will be at all levels. That is an issue we \nwill take up.\n  The Senator from South Carolina, Senator Lindsey Graham, had proposed \nan amendment on disclosure, on transparency, sunshine. There again, \nthat is a good idea. We have worked through a colloquy. I have not seen \nthe final form, but I was discussing it with Senator Graham again this \nmorning and the staffs are working that out. I anticipate we will have \nthat finished.\n  The Senator from Illinois, Senator Durbin, had a proposed amendment \non mass actions. We had worked through to see if we could formulate a \ncolloquy. That has not reached fruition. Senator Durbin has decided to \nwithdraw. That is a complex matter which we took up in committee 2 \nyears ago. We made some modifications in the bill, but it is very \nimportant as this bill moves forward to become law that it be dealt \nwith as a procedural change, that there not be substantive changes in \nthe rights of the parties.\n  We have sought to move into the Federal courts in order to avoid \nforum shopping on judges or courts where there is some indication of a \nprejudicial predisposition. It is my hope as this class action bill is \ninterpreted that it will not effect substantive rights.\n  There is a tender issue on selection of State law where there are a \nnumber of States involved. There is a lot of commonality in our law \ninjected through the uniform commercial code and interjected through \nthe restatement of varieties of substantive matters such as torts, \nwhere class actions can be certified, so it is my hope this bill, this \nact, will not be interpreted to curtail a substantive right.\n  There is a great deal of wisdom in the Senate on this bipartisan bill \nwhich has received considerable support on the Democratic side of the \naisle as well as very strong support on the Republican side of the \naisle to move through without a conference where we might have had a \nbill which was a great deal more restrictive of plaintiffs' rights, \nwhere we might have had a bill where the House provision calls for \nretroactive application. That would upset a great many existing \nlawsuits. All factors considered, we have come to a wise conclusion.\n  Mr CORNYN. Mr. President, I have spoken previously on this floor \nabout my concerns that this legislation does not go far enough to \naddress the scandal of litigation abuse that plagues our civil justice \nsystem. I stand by those concerns today. We can and should do more to \nreduce the burden of frivolous, expensive litigation. Our Nation's \neconomic competitiveness in the 21st century depends on it.\n  We should consider additional measures that better level the playing \nfield, that produce a good flow of information and transparency, and \nthat provide a clear relationship between plaintiffs and their \nattorneys.\n  But while this modest legislation could do more, I believe that S. 5 \nis an important first step to reform--a step in the right direction.\n\n[[Page S1245]]\n\n  By providing for removal of a greater number of class action lawsuits \nfrom State court to Federal court and by requiring that judges \ncarefully review all coupon settlements and limit attorneys' fees paid \nto these settlements to the value actually received by class members, \nit sets the groundwork for a much needed reform.\n  In the spirit of bipartisan cooperation that drove this bill forward, \nI set aside my concerns for now and am proud to co-sponsor.\n  I thank my friend from Iowa, Senator Grassley, for his leadership and \npersistence on this issue. For five consecutive Congresses, dating back \nto 1997, Senator Grassley has taken up the mantel of class action \nreform and he deserves a great deal of credit for it.\n  Finally, I want to thank Chairman Specter and Senator Hatch for their \ncontinued stewardship. Without them, this bill would not be where it is \ntoday.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have a few minutes remaining on my 10 \nminutes. I notice the distinguished Democratic leader is here, but I \nsaid I would yield to the Senator from Connecticut, Senator Dodd. He \nhas a very unique spot in my evaluation of Senators because he was \nelected in the class of 1980. He reminds me there were 18 of us \nelected, and the Democrats, through their tenacity and wisdom, have \nmaintained 50 percent of their class and the Republicans, on the other \nhand, have only retained 12\\1/2\\ percent. Of course, we started with 16 \nto 2, so let the record show that the Republicans from the class of \n1980 still outnumber the Democrats 2 to 1.\n  I yield to Senator Dodd.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania. One \nof the great pleasures over the past 24 years has been to serve with \nArlen Specter in this body.\n  We are nearing the end of consideration of this bill.\n  I would like to spend just a few minutes to offer some thoughts on \nit.\n  First, a brief word about the process by which this bill has been \nconsidered by the Senate. I don't think it is an overstatement to say \nthat--aside from the details of the legislation itself--the most \nimportant factor in its expected passage is the unanimous consent \nagreement that was put into place at the onset of the Senate's \ndeliberations on the bill.\n  In that respect, the two leaders--Senator Frist and Senator Reid--are \nto be greatly commended. Either one could have refused to enter into \nsuch an agreement--which would have made the prospects for passage of \nthis legislation far less certain.\n  As I said yesterday, a determined minority of even one Senator can \nimpede or block consideration of legislation in this body. Either \nLeader, by declining to enter into a consent agreement, could have \npaved the way for others to employ dilatory, delaying, and distracting \ntactics.\n  However, both Senators Reid and Frist agreed that only relevant \namendments to the bill would be in order. No doubt, that agreement \ndispleased some members in both caucuses. However, it helped ensure \nthat the debate we have had on this bill has been substantive, orderly, \nand deliberate. And it minimized the risk that this bill would be \nderailed by contentious issues wholly unrelated to the substance of the \nbill itself.\n  So the cooperation shown by the two leaders on this legislation \ncannot be overemphasized. Senator Reid is to be particularly commended \nin this regard, given that a majority of the members of his caucus do \nnot appear to support the bill.\n  The consent agreement that he entered into with the majority leader \ndemonstrates his commitment to working in as cooperative a manner as \npossible for the good of the Senate.\n  Allow me to spend a few moments talking about the substance of this \nlegislation. We have heard a lot of characterizations over the past few \ndays to describe the bill and the problems it seeks to correct. I am \namong those who believe that our class action system is in need of \nreform. There are clear abuses and shortcomings that have not served \nthe interests of the parties or the interests of justice. And this bill \ntakes a number of significant steps to remedy those abuses and \nshortcomings.\n  To those who say that this legislation will have dire consequences on \nthe quality of justice in our Nation, I must respectfully disagree. And \nI do so for a number of reasons.\n  First, it is important to view this legislation in a larger \nperspective. According to one estimate, .92 percent of all cases filed \nin Federal courts over the past three decades have been class actions. \nThis point deserves special emphasis: from 1972 to 2002, less than one \npercent of all cases filed in the Federal courts of our Nation have \nbeen class actions.\n  Not all states compile similar data, so there are no comparable \nstatistics for class actions as a percentage of all cases filed in \nState courts. However, there is every reason to believe that the \npercentage of class actions filed in state courts is at least as \nminuscule as the percentage filed in state courts. My point is simply \nthis: that this legislation will affect only a very small percentage of \nall cases filed in our courts--less than 1 percent.\n  Some would argue that if even one just case in America were denied by \nthis bill, that would be an unit result, and merit the defeat of this \nbill. I am not unsympathetic to that argument. Indeed, I agree \nwholeheartedly with it. Our system of justice is premised on the belief \nthat equal justice under law is the right of each and every citizen.\n  Even one just cause unjustly denied offends our Nation's commitment \nto justice and fair play. Any legislation that would deny to even one \ncitizen the right to equal justice deserves opposition, at least in \nthis Senator's opinion.\n  But this bill does not deny such a right. It does not even come \nclose. It will not close the courthouse door on a single citizen.\n  Moreover--unlike other legislation that has been considered by this \nbody--it will not cap damages in a single case.\n  It will not cap attorney's fees for a single class action lawyer.\n  It will not extinguish or alter in any way a single pending class \naction.\n  Nor does it impose more rigorous pleading requirements or evidentiary \nstandards of proof in a single class action.\n  In short, no citizen will in any way lose his or her right to go to \ncourt and seek the redress of grievances.\n  My colleagues might ask: if this bill will not do any of these \nthings, then what will it do?\n  First and foremost, it will put an end to the kind of abusive forum-\nshopping that has grown in frequency and notoriety over the past few \nyears.\n  Opponents of this bill claim that, by in any way altering the \nprocedural rules governing class actions, substantive rights will be \ndenied.\n  However, this argument is trumped by a little document called the \nU.S. Constitution.\n  Article III of that document extends Federal jurisdiction to suits \nbetween ``citizens of different States.'' The purpose of extending this \n``diversity jurisdiction'' to citizens is to prevent the citizens of \none State from being discriminated against by the courts of another \nState.\n  However, over the years, this purpose has been increasingly thwarted \nby clever pleading practices of enterprising class action attorneys.\n  By adding a plaintiff or a defendant to a lawsuit solely based on \ntheir citizenship, they have been able to defeat efforts to move cases \nto Federal court--even cases involving multiple parties from multiple \nStates. Likewise, by alleging an amount in controversy that does not \ntrigger the $75,000 threshold, they have thwarted Federal \njurisdiction--even in cases alleging millions if not billions of \ndollars in damages.\n  In short, current pleading practice by the class action plaintiffs \nbar has very effectively denied Federal jurisdiction over cases that \nare predominantly interstate in nature. These are precisely the kinds \nof cases the Framers thought deserve to be heard in Federal courts.\n  All that this legislation does in this respect is bring pleading \npractice more into line with constitutional requirements. Cases that \nare primarily intra- rather than interstate in nature may continue to \nbe heard in State courts.\n  But those that are clearly interstate in nature will now be more \nlikely to be heard in Federal court, where they belong.\n  The notion that cases will be ``dismissed'' as a result of this and \nother changes created by this legislation is, in my view, patently \nabsurd. No provision of this legislation requires a single case to be \ndismissed. Plaintiffs' attorneys may end up spending more time in\n\n[[Page S1246]]\n\nFederal court than State court. They may not be able to pick a class of \nplaintiffs that is as large as they can now, or that encompasses as \nmany States. They may end up bringing cases in two or more courts that \nthey might have preferred to bring in a single court. But they will not \nfind their cases dismissed.\n  As my friend and colleague from Utah, Senator Hatch, said earlier, \ngood lawyers will find a way to do well under this bill. Good lawyers \nwill do well in Federal courts, as they have done well in State courts. \nIn that sense, then, this bill is exceedingly modest.\n  We write our laws on paper. We do not etch them in stone. I am \nconfident that the bill we have written here is a good one. I believe \nthat, if and when it becomes law, it will withstand the test of time. \nLikewise, I am confident that if in the future any shortcomings emerge, \nwe will have the good sense to fix them.\n  By way of analogy, I remind our colleagues of another reform bill \nthat was considered several years ago. The Senator from New Mexico, \nSenator Domenici, and I wrote a bill to address frivolous securities \nlawsuits directed primarily at high-tech companies. The bill was on the \nfloor of the Senate for about 2 weeks, if I recall correctly. A number \nof amendments were offered. It ultimately became law, despite a \nPresidential veto.\n  There were those who predicted dire consequences as a result of that \nbill's enactment. We were told that securities lawsuits would dry up, \nthat harmed investors would have no recourse.\n  Well, here we are, about 9 years after enactment of that law, and \nthere has been no appreciable drop-off in investor lawsuits and \nrecoveries. In fact, some of the most vehement opponents of that law in \nthe trial bar continue to be some of the most successful under the law.\n  In sum, we have written a good bill here. It deserves to become law. \nI hope that it will. I want to acknowledge those of our colleagues who \nare most responsible for bringing us to this point: Senators Frist and \nReid, as I have already mentioned; as well as Senators Grassley, Kohl, \nHatch, Feinstein, Carper, and others. I also want to acknowledge the \nhard work of their staff, who in some cases have worked on this \nlegislation for a number of years.\n  So, to briefly reiterate, I thank my leader, Senator Reid, and the \nmajority leader, as well. We would not be in the position we are in, I \nhave said on several occasions over the last 3 or 4 days, had the \nDemocratic leader--particularly because the minority always has unique \nrights in this Senate to delay or stop legislation moving at all.\n  Even though my colleague from Nevada has strong reservations, which I \nam sure he will express shortly, about the substance of this bill, as a \nresult of his willingness to let a product move forward, we are here \ntoday about to adopt a piece of legislation. When I hear some of the \ncomments being made about whether Democrats are willing to work on \nissues, even ones they disagree with, that is belied by the fact that \nthe minority leader made it possible for us to be here to deal with all \nrelevant, germane amendments on this bill. I thank the Senator from \nNevada for his efforts in allowing that to go forward.\n  There has been a lot of talk over the last several days. Classically, \nwith a matter like this the opponents and proponents have a tendency to \nengage in, if I may say with all due respect, a little bit of \nhyperbole. But it's important to stick to the facts. And one important \nfact that should shape how we view this legislation is that less than 1 \npercent of all cases filed in the Federal courts since 1972 have been \nclass action cases. I searched very tirelessly to find out the \npercentages in State courts. I could not come up with an exact number. \nI am told by those knowledgeable the number of class actions filed in \nState courts as a percentage of all State actions is not substantially \ndifferent than the Federal courts, and is likely to be even smaller \ngiven the large number of State cases filed generally. What is beyond \ndispute is that a very small percentage of the cases filed in our court \nsystems are class actions.\n  Obviously, if anyone is denied access to the courts in this country \nbecause of things we do here, then, obviously, justice is denied to \nsomeone who cannot make that case.\n  We have not done that. This system of class action is in need of \nreform.\n  This is about money. Unfortunately, it is not about the money that \nlegitimate plaintiffs get; it is about the money that is either saved \nby a defendant or made by the plaintiffs' bar. That is what this is \nabout, and forum shopping around the country, finding the venue that \ngets you the best possible result for your particular point of view--\nnot exactly what the Founders had in mind when they drafted the \ndiversity provisions of article III of the Federal Constitution. If you \nwant to change the Constitution and say that no longer should diversity \napply, then you may try to do that. If that is what opponents of this \nlegislation believe, then they can try to amend the Constitution to in \neffect keep all these cases in State courts. But since the founding of \nthis Republic, the diversity clause of article III of the Constitution \nhas been very clear.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Connecticut be allowed 5 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. I will go quickly.\n  The point is, this is about court reform more than tort reform. About \nfifteen months ago, as many of my colleagues recall, we worked out this \nbill. We struck an agreement, a good one. Unfortunately, the majority \nhere, last year, decided not to bring this bill up. I believe they made \na mistake in doing that. We could have wrapped this bill up in January \nof 2004 but did not do it. This agreement has been ready for the \nSenate's consideration for over a year. We have had good debate on some \nof these amendments, and we have drafted a pretty good bill. It is not \nwritten in marble; it is not written in granite; it is written on \npaper. And we think it is going to provide equal access to the courts. \nIt is going to provide a fairness to plaintiffs and defendants, to see \nthat they get a just decision regarding the matters that are brought \nbefore the courts.\n  So to my colleagues who are strong opponents of all of this, believe \nme, this bill is a simple matter of court reform. It will help ensure \nthat victims of wrongdoing get fair compensation and relief, rather \nthan a raw deal that lines the pockets of those who either allegedly \nrepresent them or those who are on the defendant side who want to avoid \nsome of the payments they would otherwise have to make.\n  There are no caps in this bill. It does not impose any rigorous \nprocedural requirements or evidentiary requirements of proof at all. In \nshort, no citizen will in any way lose his or her right to go to court \nto seek redress for their grievances.\n  You get anecdotal stories, hearing of one case or another. This bill \nis about court reform, getting a system right. It is long overdue. It \ndoes not mean that every tort reform measure that comes before us ought \nto be supported, but on this one, those of us who worked on this \nbelieve we have done a good job. We were asked to make four \nimprovements in this bill. We made 12 of them over a year ago.\n  I thank the Senator from Delaware, Mr. Carper, Senator Feinstein, \nSenator Schumer, Senator Landrieu, and other Members on the Democratic \nside who have worked on this issue to make this possible.\n  Again, my thanks--and it should be noted--to the distinguished \nSenator from Nevada, Mr. Reid, and Senator Frist, who struck a \nprocedural agreement so the Senate could consider this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, yesterday on the Senate floor I expressed \nserious concerns about this legislation that is pending before the \nSenate. I explained at that time that this legislation, in my opinion, \nis one of the most unfair, anti-consumer pieces of legislation to come \nbefore the Senate in a long time. It slams the courthouse doors on a \nwide range of injury plaintiffs, it turns federalism upside down by \npreventing State courts from hearing State law claims, and it limits \ncorporate accountability at a time of rampant corporate scandals. \nInstead of turning up\n\n[[Page S1247]]\n\nthe heat on corporate fraud, this bill lets corporate wrongdoers off \nthe hook.\n  At the beginning of the debate yesterday, I said this is a bad piece \nof legislation, but there are going to be some amendments offered, \namendments that will improve this bad legislation. They would have made \nsignificant improvements. But my hope of these amendments passing was \nvery short lived. It did not happen. Over the last 2 days, the Senate \nhas turned away each and every effort to make this bill less offensive. \nEvery single amendment--each a message of fairness--was debated and \nturned down. That is a shame. Proponents of this bill explained their \nopposition to the common sense amendments by describing the current \nbill as a ``delicate compromise.'' I have heard that so many times. I \nspoke to Congressman Sensenbrenner, the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee in the House, who is supposedly the gatekeeper on this \nlegislation. He said: We are going to accept legislation that is in \nkeeping with what you did last time. Well, when he said, What you did \nlast time, he was talking about the bill that came out of the Senate \nJudiciary committee and was here on the floor. These changes would not \nhave dramatically altered that.\n  If you went downtown to see what K Street wanted with these \namendments, of course they were against all of them because, in my \nopinion, this legislation slams the door on most everyone who wants to \nbring a case and use class action as the tool for coming to court.\n  The debate yesterday was characterized by two significant \nmisunderstandings about the bill. First, proponents claimed that under \nthis bill, class action lawsuits could stay in State courts as long as \ntwo-thirds of the plaintiffs are from a single State. Well, in fact, \nthe bill reverses longstanding Federal court diversity rules by saying \nthat no matter how many plaintiffs are from a single State, the case \ncan still be removed to Federal court if the defendant corporation is \nincorporated in a different State. Keep in mind, of the Fortune 500 \ncompanies, 58 percent of them are incorporated in Delaware, so the \nmajority of class action lawsuits would be removable just on that \nfigure alone.\n  For example, in the State of Nevada, at the famous Yucca Mountain, \nthe contractors were in such a rush, the Department of Energy was in \nsuch a rush to drill a hole in this mountain, they had a huge auger. \nThe size of this auger was halfway to the top of the second story of \nthis Chamber. It was a huge machine. It dug a hole almost as big as \nthis Chamber--a big tool going right through that mountain. They knew \nthey were coming to a formation there and that the toxic mineral dust \nfrom drilling the formation would cause people to get really sick with \nsilicosis. They knew that, but they were in such a rush that they would \nnot even wet down this big tool to prevent the dust. They drilled dry, \nso to speak, and this toxic dust flew all over and the workers inhaled \nit. And today, as we speak, people are dying as a result of that.\n  Well, there has been a request for the case to be considered a class \naction--under the old law in existence before this passes--that would \nallow all those workers to join together in a class action and have it \ncertified. Even though well over two-thirds of the plaintiffs are \nresidents of Nevada, the harm was caused in Nevada, and the defendants \nwere obviously doing business in Nevada, a defendant incorporated in a \nState other than Nevada could remove the case from Nevada State court. \nThat is how this bill works. It is just unfair.\n\n  The second mischaracterization of this legislation is that supporters \nmake it sound as though all we are talking about is venue: These cases \nwill simply move from State court to Federal court and proceed just the \nsame. That is simply not true. Under Supreme Court precedents that this \nbill does nothing to change, Federal judges routinely dismiss class \naction lawsuits based on State law. Those cases that are not dismissed \ngo to the back of a very long line in the overburdened Federal court \nsystem.\n  One of the foremost experts on class actions is a man who is also an \nexpert in antitrust law. He is a professor at Harvard Law School. His \nname is Arthur Miller. Here is what he said:\n\n       Federal courts have consistently denied class certification \n     in multi-state lawsuits based on consumer as well as other \n     state laws. . . . not a single Federal Circuit Court has \n     granted class certification for such a lawsuit, and six \n     Circuit Courts have expressly denied certification.\n\n  The rejection of the Feinstein-Bingaman amendment shows this bill's \ntrue colors. And I admire greatly Senator Feinstein for having the \ncourage to do the right thing and say: I have been one of the original \npushers of this legislation, but what we are trying to do is unfair, \nand the Bingaman amendment should be adopted. She joined with him for \nthe Feinstein-Bingaman amendment.\n  So, if the sponsors merely wanted federal court review of lawsuits \nwith national implications, they would not object to an amendment \nmaking clear that federal judges may not dismiss these cases.\n  But without that change, the truth is plain to see: This bill is \ndesigned to bury class action lawsuits, to cut off the one means by \nwhich individual Americans ripped off by fraudulent or deceptive \npractices can band together to demand justice from corporate America.\n  What does this change mean in the real world? It means, for example, \nthat cases like the one brought by Shaneen Wahl will not be able to go \nforward. Shaneen is a 55 year old woman, and she was diagnosed with \nbreast cancer. Her health insurance company raised the rates on her \ninsurance premiums from $194 a month to $1,800 a month--a little jump \nin price. She found out that her insurance company was improperly doing \nthis for tens of thousands of other chronically ill patients. She got a \nlawyer, they banded together in a class action lawsuit, and they \nprevailed in state court. Under this legislation, the case would be \ndismissed.\n\n  Another breast cancer survivor also a Florida woman, is 40-year-old \nSusan Friedman. Susan's insurance company removed her case to federal \ncourt, where it was dismissed. She is an unlucky example of what will \nhappen to more people under this legislation. This is the fate of many \nother class action lawsuits under the bill the Senate will soon pass.\n  Unfortunately, insurance companies are ripping people off all the \ntime, and this legislation will give the biggest, best businesses in \nthe world, the insurance companies, more money.\n  In the real world, this legislation means that when a phone company \nsystematically bills customers for services they had cancelled or a \nplumbing company routinely overcharges customers by $10, those \npractices will not be brought to light. The dollar amounts would be too \nsmall. Why should the plumbing company get an extra $10 from everyone? \nI guess what this legislation means is if you cheat a lot, you can take \nthem to court, but if you cheat just a little bit, lots and lots of \ntimes, have at it, because no one can do anything about it. This is the \n``cheat a little bit'' legislation.\n  This legislation is not good. It will help the tobacco industry avoid \naccountability. It virtually guarantees that tobacco-related cases will \nend up in federal court where they won't be able to proceed. I had a \nperson, Fritz Hahn, who lived on my property in Nevada to keep an eye \non things. He was there for many years. He started smoking when he was \na teenager. He is now dead as a result of tobacco. He smoked too much. \nHe got throat cancer. He died a slow, terrible death. But for class \naction lawyers, tobacco companies would have a free rein, and they \nwould be able to kill a lot more people like Fritz Hahn.\n  That is what class action is all about, joining together and going \nafter those companies who do bad things to people. However, this \nlegislation will make it so much more difficult. That is why numerous \nconsumer groups, including the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, the \nLeadership Conference on Civil Rights, the Consumers Union, the AFL-\nCIO, Public Citizen, and many others have urged the Senate to reject \nthe bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record scores and scores of \ncompanies that support my statement against this legislation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S1248]]\n\n National Organizations Opposed to Federal Class Action Legislation as \n                            of May 21, 2004\n\n       AARP, ADA Watch/National Coalition for Disability Rights, \n     AFL-CIO, Alliance for Healthy Homes, Alliance for Justice, \n     Alliance for Retired Americans, American Association of \n     People with Disabilities, American Association of University \n     Women, American Cancer Society, American Heart Association, \n     American Federation of Government Employees, American \n     Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, American \n     Lung Association, American-Arab Anti-Discrimination \n     Committee, Americans for Democratic Action, Bazelon Center \n     for Mental Health Law, Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun \n     Violence, United with the Million Mom March, and Campaign for \n     Tobacco Free Kids.\n       Center for Disability and Health, Center for Justice and \n     Democracy, Center for Responsible Lending, Center for Women \n     Policy Studies, Civil Justice, Inc., Clean Water Action, \n     Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, Commission on Social Action \n     of Reform Judaism, Communication Workers of America, Consumer \n     Federation of America, Consumers for Auto Reliability and \n     Safety, Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund, \n     Earthjustice, Education Law Center, Environmental Working \n     Group, Epilepsy Foundation, Families USA, Federally Employed \n     Women, Friends of the Earth, and Gray Panthers.\n       Greenpeace, Homeowners Against Deficient Dwellings, Jewish \n     Labor Committee, Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under \n     Law, Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, Mexican American \n     Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Mineral Policy Center, \n     NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund, National Alliance of \n     Postal and Federal Employees, National Asian Pacific Legal \n     Consortium, National Association for the Advancement of \n     Colored People, National Association for Equal Opportunity in \n     Higher Ed, National Association of Consumer Advocates, \n     National Association of Consumer Agency Administrators, \n     National Association of the Deaf, National Association of \n     Protection and Advocacy Systems, National Bar Association, \n     National Campaign for Hearing Health, National Center on \n     Poverty Law, and National Coalition on Black Civic \n     Participation.\n       National Committee on Pay Equity, National Consumer Law \n     Center, National Consumer's Coalition, National Council of La \n     Raza, National Employment Lawyers Association, National Fair \n     Housing Alliance, National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, \n     National Law Center on Homeless & Poverty, National Legal Aid \n     and Defender Association, National Organization for Women, \n     National Partnership for Women & Families, Natural Resources \n     Defense Council, National Workrights Institute, National \n     Women's Health Network, National Women's Law Center, North \n     Carolina Justice Center, NOW Legal Defense and Education \n     Fund, People for the American Way, Public Citizen, and Pride \n     at Work.\n       Project Equality, Religious Coalition for Reproductive \n     Choice, Sargent Shriver National Center on Poverty Law, \n     Service Employees International Union, Sierra Club, Tobacco \n     Control Resource Center, Tobacco Products Liability Project, \n     UNITE!, United Food and Commercial Workers International \n     Union, United Steelworkers of America, USAction, U.S. Public \n     Interest Research Group, Violence Policy Center, and Women \n     Employed.\n\n      Government Organizations Opposed to Class-Action Legislation\n\n       Conference of Chief Justices (State Supreme Court \n     Justices), Judicial Conference of the United States (Federal \n     Judges Association), Attorney General of California, Bill \n     Lockyer, Attorney General of Illinois, Lisa Madigan, Attorney \n     General of Maryland, J.

State court judges, Federal \njudges, many state Attorneys General, and the National Conference of \nState Legislators are against it. Officials in our home States are \ntelling us not to do this. The only groups that want us to pass this \nbill are those representing defendants in these lawsuits. Sure, they \nwant to be relieved of the burden of accountability. We shouldn't let \nthem. This is not just a battle between big business and lawyers. It is \nmore. It is certainly more anti-lawyer than I would like to think. But \nthat is what we hear coming from the White House.\n  At a meeting in Las Vegas, the President said: The most hurtful thing \nin the American economy today is lawyers. I don't believe that, as \nindicated by the instances I gave about tobacco. Sure there are bad \nlawyers who bring meritless cases, and there should be something we do \nto crack down on them. But this bill is not about punishing bad \nlawyers. More fundamentally this bill is about limiting access to civil \ncourts and hurting consumers.\n  One of the grievances that inspired our Founding Fathers to revolt \nagainst King George was they couldn't bring their grievances to a body.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. REID. What time is that? I will use leader time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator had 10 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. I thank the Chair.\n  As I was saying, one of the grievances that inspired our Founding \nFathers to revolt against King George was limited access to the civil \ncourts. That was based on the rights secured in the year 1215, when \nKing John signed the Magna Carta. King John couldn't sign his name, so \nhe put an X. From that day forward, one of the things that was brought \nover the ocean and is now in our common law, when the Founding Fathers \ndeveloped our country, is that you bring to court your grievances. They \nhad a jury that could sit down and talk about what was good and bad \nabout your case. Access to the courts is a basic right in our \ndemocracy, and after today it will be a diminished right.\n  These rights are being denigrated, taken away from us with this \nlegislation. It is too bad. A basic right that has been in existence \nsince we have been a country, they are chipping away at.\n  I am going to vote against this ill-considered bill. I recognize it \nis going to pass. I think that is too bad. I can say this without any \nquestion: Downtown beat us. There is no question about that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in a few minutes we will be voting on the \nClass Action Fairness Act. We have before us truly a bipartisan bill \nthat was introduced with 32 cosponsors, 24 Republicans and 8 Democrats. \nIt was voted out of the Judiciary Committee on a strong bipartisan \nvote. Every vote on every amendment that has been offered has been \nbipartisan, if we look at the vote tallies. I do anticipate that in a \nfew minutes our vote on final passage will be strongly bipartisan as \nwell.\n  There are a few misconceptions about the bill that I would like to \ndefinitively dispel in these final moments. This bill does not close \nthe courthouse doors to injured or aggrieved plaintiffs. It does not. \nThis is court reform. It is designed to rein in lawsuit abuses, and it \ndoes just that. The plaintiff may end up in Federal court, yes, rather \nthan State court, but no citizen will lose his or her right to bring a \ncase--no citizen. In fact, the Class Action Fairness Act will protect \nplaintiffs in large interstate class action cases. No longer will \npredatory lawyers be able to negotiate deals that leave their clients \nwith coupons while they take home millions. Plaintiffs will now be \ncovered by a consumer bill of rights for the first time, a consumer \nbill of rights that will require lawyer's fees for coupon settlements \nto be based either on the value of the coupons that are actually \nredeemed or on the hours actually billed.\n  Take the case such as the one in my home State of Tennessee involving \na Memphis car dealer. It was discovered that a dealership was \ninstructing its employees to cheat car purchasers by as much as $2,000. \nNumerous residents were affected so a class action suit was filed. The \nsuit was eventually settled, and the plaintiffs received a coupon for \n$1,200, but that coupon could only be used if they went back to the \nsame dealer who had cheated them in the first place and bought another \ncar. Meanwhile, the trial attorneys who settled the suit received $1.3 \nmillion in legal fees. A number of customers were understandably upset \nthat in order to receive any financial benefit, they would have to take \nthat coupon and go back to the very same dealer, while at the same time \nthe lawyers were able to take their money and put it right into their \npockets. The legislation before us today will put a stop to such unfair \npractices.\n  Second, the class action bill will help end the phenomenon that we \nall recognize known as forum shopping. Aggressive trial lawyers have \nfound that a few counties are lawsuit friendly, and in these select \nState courts, judges are quick to certify a class action and juries are \nknown to grant extravagant damage awards. Meanwhile, this same \ndefendant can face copycat cases all\n\n[[Page S1249]]\n\nacross the country, each jury granting a different result. These \ncounties may have little or no geographic relationship to either the \nplaintiff or to the defendant, but the trial lawyers know that simply \nthe threat of suing in these particular counties can lead to huge, \nextravagant cash settlements. One study estimates that virtually every \nsector of the U.S. economy is on trial in only three State courts.\n  The Class Action Fairness Act moves those large nationwide cases that \ngenuinely impact interstate commerce to the Federal courts where they \nbelong. The Class Action Fairness Act is a good bill. It is a fair \nbill. It is a significant first step in putting an end to the lawsuit \nabuses that undermine our legal system.\n  I commend my colleagues for their hard work. I thank, in particular, \nSenator Grassley, the bill's lead sponsor, who has been working on this \nissue for a decade; Senator Specter, for leading the bill expeditiously \nthrough the Judiciary Committee and on to the floor; Senator Hatch, who \nhas been a tireless advocate for legal reform and class action reform \nand has helped to manage this bill on the floor; Senator Cornyn, who \nhas been tireless in his presence and participation on this class \naction bill over the last several days; the bill's Democratic \nsupporters, especially Senator Kohl, Senator Dodd, Senator Carper, \nSenator Ben Nelson; all have worked and reached across the aisle \ndespite great pressure from the bill's opponents, and for that I thank \nthem.\n  Finally, I thank the Democratic leader, Harry Reid, for working on a \nprocess. We just heard him speaking on the floor against the bill. In \nspite of that personal feeling toward this bill, he has worked in a \nreal leadership manner--working with us to deal with the bill in a \ntimely and expeditious manner on the floor.\n  The American people expect and deserve a government that works and \nleaders who work together. I think they have seen it play out very well \non this bill. They did elect us to govern toward meaningful solutions. \nThe bill, I believe, demonstrates we are accomplishing just that. We \nare meeting the challenge and we are moving America forward. I look \nforward to quick passage of the bill in the House and being able to \nsend it to the President's desk.\n  Mr. President, we will vote very shortly. So that Members can plan on \ntheir schedules, this upcoming vote on final passage of the class \naction fairness bill will be the last vote of the evening.\n  Following this vote, we will have a few Members making statements. We \nwill remain in session for a short period today. The Senate will not be \nin session tomorrow and we will reconvene on Monday.\n  On Monday, the plans are to begin debate on the nomination of Michael \nChertoff to be Secretary of Homeland Security. At closing today, we \nwill reach an agreement that will provide for debate on the Chertoff \nnomination during Monday's session, with a vote to occur on that \nnomination on Tuesday.\n  Therefore, I am prepared to announce we will not have any votes on \nMonday. I will have more to say about the precise timing of the debate \nand vote later today when we wrap up our business. Once again, I thank \nall Members for their cooperation and assistance throughout the debate \non the class action bill. I believe we are ready for final passage.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). Is there a sufficient second? \nThere is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill pass?\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senators were necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Santorum) and the Senator from New \nHampshire (Mr. Sununu).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 72, nays 26, as follows:\n\n                       [Rollcall Vote No. 9 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--72\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Burr\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feinstein\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Obama\n     Reed\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--26\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Boxer\n     Byrd\n     Clinton\n     Corzine\n     Dayton\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Sarbanes\n     Stabenow\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Santorum\n     Sununu\n       \n  The bill (S. 5) was passed, as follows:\n\n                                  S. 5\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Class action lawsuits are an important and valuable \n     part of the legal system when they permit the fair and \n     efficient resolution of legitimate claims of numerous parties \n     by allowing the claims to be aggregated into a single action \n     against a defendant that has allegedly caused harm.\n       (2) Over the past decade, there have been abuses of the \n     class action device that have--\n       (A) harmed class members with legitimate claims and \n     defendants that have acted responsibly;\n       (B) adversely affected interstate commerce; and\n       (C) undermined public respect for our judicial system.\n       (3) Class members often receive little or no benefit from \n     class actions, and are sometimes harmed, such as where--\n       (A) counsel are awarded large fees, while leaving class \n     members with coupons or other awards of little or no value;\n       (B) unjustified awards are made to certain plaintiffs at \n     the expense of other class members; and\n       (C) confusing notices are published that prevent class \n     members from being able to fully understand and effectively \n     exercise their rights.\n       (4) Abuses in class actions undermine the national judicial \n     system, the free flow of interstate commerce, and the concept \n     of diversity jurisdiction as intended by the framers of the \n     United States Constitution, in that State and local courts \n     are--\n       (A) keeping cases of national importance out of Federal \n     court;\n       (B) sometimes acting in ways that demonstrate bias against \n     out-of-State defendants; and\n       (C) making judgments that impose their view of the law on \n     other States and bind the rights of the residents of those \n     States.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to--\n       (1) assure fair and prompt recoveries for class members \n     with legitimate claims;\n       (2) restore the intent of the framers of the United States \n     Constitution by providing for Federal court consideration of \n     interstate cases of national importance under diversity \n     jurisdiction; and\n       (3) benefit society by encouraging innovation and lowering \n     consumer prices.\n\n[[Page S1250]]\n\n      SEC. 3.

Mr. President, the staggering cost estimates for the \nMedicare prescription drug benefit, coupled with the small number of \nseniors who have signed up so far, has threatened the very survival of \nthis program. I do not want to see that happen, having voted for this \nprogram. I want to see the Senate take the steps to ensure that it \nworks; that it delivers medicine to our seniors in a cost-effective \nway, and ensures that it reaches the hopes and expectations that \nmillions of older people and their families have for this program.\n  The fact is, the Medicare prescription drug program now faces two \nvery serious problems. The first is the skyrocketing cost. These are \nthe costs we have been debating throughout the week, that have been far \ngreater than anyone could have predicted.\n  A second problem may also herald very big concerns. To date, a small \nnumber of older people have signed up for the first part of the drug \nbenefit, the drug card. So what you have is a pretty combustible mix. \nThe combination of escalating costs and a skimpy number of older people \nsigning up thus far raises the very real problem that a huge amount of \nGovernment money will be spent on a very small number of people. That \nis a prescription for a program that cannot survive.\n  I do not want to see that happen. As someone who voted for this \nprogram and worked with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to make \nthis program work to meet the urgent needs of the Nation's older \npeople, I think the Senate ought to be taking corrective action and \ntake corrective action now, in order to deal with what I think are \nlooming problems.\n  As I said, we learned a bit about the escalating costs of the \nprogram. But when you couple that with low levels of participation by \nolder people, that is particularly troublesome. I think it is fair to \nsay, if the drug card debacle--the first part of the program and the \nsmall number of older people signing up for the drug card continues \ninto the full benefit phase of the program, what you have is a \nsituation where I believe people are going to say this program cannot \nbe justified at a time of scarce Government resources.\n\n  To turn for a moment to the drug card part of the program that I \ndon't think has been discussed much lately, the choices are eye-\nglazing. There are more than 70 cards available; 39 you can get in any \npart of the country, the other 30-plus you can get only in some States. \nThe Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services \nreported in an informal survey that the program information was \nconfusing and inadequate.\n  What makes it amazing is that a lot of folks who were looking at it \nare people who were relatives of HHS employees. So you have a situation \nwhere even folks connected with those who would know a fair amount \nabout this program are having difficulty sorting through it.\n  I have come to the floor today to try to sound a wake-up call, to say \nthose of us who voted for the program, like myself, and those who \nopposed it, we ought to be working together on a bipartisan basis now \nto correct it. The first part of that effort should be to put in place \nsensible cost containment like we see in the private sector. It is \nincomprehensible to me that this program is not using the kind of cost \ncontainment strategies that you see in Minnesota and Oregon and all \nacross the country.\n  The Medicare Program is pretty much like a fellow standing in the \nPrice Club who buys one roll of toilet paper at a time. They are not \nshopping in a smart way. They are not using their purchasing power. I \nand Senator Snowe have sought to correct that and\n\n[[Page S1253]]\n\nto take steps to use sensible cost containment strategies and ensure \nthat the costs of this program are held down.\n  Second, I think we need to take steps to make sure that some of the \nmistakes of the past are avoided. CMS, the agency charged with dealing \nwith this program, needs people with expertise to answer the questions \nof seniors and family members. There needs to be better information, on \nthe net and elsewhere, that is not incomprehensible gobbledygook. \nSeniors are going to need information about real savings for each plan. \nPie-in-the-sky projections, which is what they have gotten thus far, \nare not going to cut it. That is what we saw this week with respect to \nthese cost estimates. Suffice it to say, the U.S. Congress is not \nsatisfied.\n  I believe without effective cost containment and without good \nadministration of the program, particularly as it moves into this next \nstage, we are going to see the bills continue to run up and we are \ngoing to see the participation of seniors continue to run down. That is \na prescription for a Government program that cannot survive. I do not \nwant to see that.\n  I stuck my neck out in order to get that legislation passed. I \nbelieve it can survive. Congress needs to hustle, now, to mend it, to \nmend it with sensible bipartisan cost containment along the lines of \nwhat is used in the private sector; mend it with changes in the way the \nprogram is administered so it goes into the second phase without some \nof the problems we saw connected with the drug card. I just hope, as a \nresult of what the Congress has learned this week, that there has been \na real wake-up call as to how urgent it is that Congress take these \ncorrective steps and that Congress move quickly. I believe this program \nnow, because of the huge new cost estimates and the problems with \ngetting folks signed up, could well be headed for life support.\n  I don't want to see that. I think it would be a tragedy. I want the \nprogram that I voted for to work. That means it has to be supplemented \nwith good cost containment and improvements in the way it is \nadministered. I intend to work with my colleagues, particularly on the \nother side of the aisle--Senator Snowe and Senator McCain, who joined \nme in this legislation--to deal with the cost containment features, \nplus many colleagues on this side of the aisle who have bills of their \nown.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, my comments will come, \nappropriately, after the distinguished Senator from Oregon, about this \nprogram that was enacted a couple of years ago, the so-called providing \nprescription drugs for senior citizens. There are a number of Senators \nhere who were promised, in order to get their votes, that this program \nwould not cost more than $400 billion over a 10-year period. Of course, \nwe know now that the result of the most recent studies is that it is \nnot $400 billion, it is $720 billion. How many more cost estimates will \ngo up and up?\n  There is one thing we can do to this legislation, legislation that \nthis Senator didn't vote for because I thought it was quite flawed--not \nonly the true costs, which we were not given, but the fact that we are \nnot allowing the principle of private enterprise to function. There is \na provision in the bill that specifically prohibits the Federal \nGovernment, through Medicare, from negotiating bulk rate purchases, \nthus bringing the cost of the prescription drugs down.\n  All of our colleagues embrace the private marketplace. Free market \ncompetition is where you can get the most efficient products at the \nleast cost.\n  Why wasn't that same principle of free market competition allowed to \nwork here in the purchase of prescription drugs for Medicare \nrecipients? It is certainly not new to the Federal Government. We have \ndone this for almost 20 years in the Veterans' Administration--for the \nVA contracts for the purchase of prescription drugs in bulk and, \ntherefore, the cost of the drugs to the Veterans' Administration is \nconsiderably less than retail price.\n  If it is good for the Department of Veterans Affairs, why isn't it \ngood for the rest of the Federal Government and for Medicare to do it? \nBut we were not allowed to because the law specifically says we are \ngoing to violate the principle of free market enterprise, and you can't \nnegotiate the price of the prescription drugs down. It seems to me that \nnot only violates the principle, it violates good common sense.\n  Now what do we do? The news has come out. No, the bill isn't going to \ncost what was promised, $400 billion over 10 years; it is going to cost \na minimum of $720 billion over 10 years. We had better be minding our \nPs and Qs or else we are going to continue to bankrupt this country by \nusing faulty mathematics.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business for as much time as I consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Dorgan pertaining to the introduction of S. 355 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/10/senate-section/article/S1253-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1253-S1254]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      PHARMACEUTICAL MARKET ACCESS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, yesterday I and 28 of my Senate colleagues \nintroduced legislation allowing the reimportation of FDA-approved \nprescription drugs from Canada and other countries. We have introduced \nlegislation of this type before, but we have been blocked from \nconsideration in the Senate. We do not intend to be blocked this year. \nWe intend to get the Senate on record. We believe there are sufficient \nvotes in the Senate to pass a bill dealing with the reimportation of \nprescription drugs. We very much hope we can get a bill to the \nPresident and have that legislation signed.\n  The 29 Senators who have reached agreement on this represent a broad \nbipartisan consensus in the Senate. That bipartisan group includes \nSenator Snowe, Senator Grassley, Senator Kennedy, Senator McCain, \nSenator Lott, Senator Stabenow, and many others--a broad group of \nRepublicans and Democrats joining together to try to put downward \npressure on prescription drug prices.\n  Let me show two pill bottles in the Senate. These bottles held the \ndrug called Lipitor, one of the most popular cholesterol-lowering drugs \nin America. Obviously, the Lipitor tablets that went into these two \nbottles are made by the same company. In each bottle, it is the same \nFDA-approved tablet, made by the same company in the same plant and put \nin the same pill bottle. The only difference is price. This bottle was \nsent to a Canadian pharmacy that paid $1.01 per tablet; this one was \nsent to the United States pharmacy that paid $1.81 per tablet.\n  Why are the Americans charged nearly double for the same pill, put in \nthe same bottle, made by the same company? Because the company can and \ndoes call the shots. We do have price controls on prescription drugs in \nthis country: it is the pharmaceutical industry that is controlling \nprices, and they have decided that the U.S. consumers should pay the \nhighest prices in the world for prescription medicines.\n  Many of us believe that should not be the case. Miracle drugs offer \nno miracles to those who cannot afford them. We have so many senior \ncitizens living on fixed incomes in this country who need prescription \ndrugs. Senior citizens are 12 percent of this country's population. Yet \nthey consume over one-third of all the prescription drugs in our \ncountry. That is why this issue is so important.\n  The reimportation legislation we have introduced is again a broad \nbipartisan agreement between Republicans and Democrats, one we intend \nto push to a vote. We believe it is finally time that we have a vote in \nthe House and the Senate and get a bill to the President. We understand \nthe President has not supported this. We understand the Food and Drug \nAdministration has been very strong and assertive in saying there are \nsafety issues with this legislation.\n  That, of course, is patently absurd. We have had testimony before the \nU.S. Congress that in Europe, for 20 years, they have done \nreimportation. In Europe, they call it ``parallel trading,'' where if \nyou are from France and want to buy a prescription drug from Germany, \nthat is just fine. If you are from\n\n[[Page S1254]]\n\nItaly and want to buy a prescription drug from Spain, that is just \nfine. Parallel trading in pharmaceuticals has occurred for 20 years, \nand there has been no safety issue.\n  We had a pharmaceutical company executive named Dr. Peter Rost, the \nvice president of marketing for a major drug company, who said:\n\n       The biggest argument against reimportation is safety. What \n     everyone has conveniently forgotten to tell you is that in \n     Europe, reimportation of drugs has been in place for 20 \n     years.\n\n  This is an executive from the drug industry itself.\n  He said something else that is important:\n\n       During my time responsible for a region in northern Europe, \n     I never once--not once--heard the drug industry, regulatory \n     agencies, the government, or anyone else saying that this \n     practice was unsafe.\n\n  He is talking about the practice of importing drugs between \ncountries. He goes on to say:\n\n       And personally, I think it is outright derogatory to claim \n     that the Americans would not be able to handle reimportation \n     of drugs, when the rest of the educated world can do this.\n\n  This is a big issue. This is not a small issue. The price of \nprescription drugs is on the march upward. Too many Americans cannot \nafford their medication. It is unfair to have the American people \ncharged the highest prices in the world. We are talking only about \nimporting FDA-approved drugs made in FDA-approved plants, in many cases \nput in identical bottles, shipped to two different locations. One \nlocation is to an American who will pay the highest price, and the \nother location is to other major countries around the world whose \ncitizens are charged much lower prices.\n  We think that is unfair. We intend to try to put downward pressure on \ndrug prices in this country by using trade. Let the American people \nbenefit from this kind of trade.\n  Finally, if people wonder whether the price difference is just with \nrespect to Lipitor, it is not. The unfair price discrepancy is \nsignificant for Prevacid, Zocor, Nexium, Zoloft--the list is very \nsubstantial.\n  For instance, Nexium is advertised a great deal on television. In the \nUnited States the price for 90 doses is $409. The price in Canada is \n$239. Or Zocor. A well-known football coach on television tells us how \nimportant Zocor is. As an American, he pays $383 for 90 doses; a \nCanadian pays 46 percent less. That describes the problem we are trying \nto correct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/10/senate-section/article/S1254-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1254-S1255]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SOCIAL SECURITY\n\n  I will mention one additional item today. That is the aggressive \ndebate that is occurring and will continue to occur on the subject of \nSocial Security. There is an array of issues that face this country--\nsome big, some small, some of consequence, some not--and we tend, from \ntime to time, to treat the serious too lightly and sometimes the light \ntoo seriously. But this issue of Social Security is a big issue.\n  I was reading something the other day about this from a Knight-Ridder \ncolumn:\n\n       The promises of Social Security retirement is a hoax. Taxes \n     paid by workers are wasted by the government rather than \n     prudently invested, and the so-called reserve fund is no \n     reserve at all because it contains nothing but government \n     IOU's.\n       Was that President Bush speaking? No, no. That was the \n     Republican presidential candidate, Alf Landon, in 1936. In \n     1936 that was the message by people who never liked Social \n     Security--those who never liked Social Security and fought \n     against it when it was created never really quit.\n\n  In 1983, the Cato Institute published a paper that served as the \nmanifesto for turning over some of Social Security to the private \nsector. It recommended the following: Consistent criticism of Social \nSecurity to undermine confidence in it. That was part of the strategy. \nConsistently criticize Social Security to undermine confidence. Build a \ncoalition of supporters for private accounts, including banks and other \nfinancial institutions that would benefit from private accounts.\n  They have done pretty well. This manifesto going back to Alf Landon, \ngoing to the Cato Institute in 1983--constantly criticize Social \nSecurity, undermine it, build a coalition of supporters, banks, and \nothers who would benefit from it. They have done pretty well because \nthey now have an administration that says Social Security is in crisis.\n  It is not, of course. Social Security is a program that has lifted \ntens of millions of senior citizens out of poverty over many decades.\n  People are living longer and better lives, so we will have to make \nsome adjustments. It does not require major surgery.\n  We will have to make some adjustments in Social Security if we do not \nget the kind of economic growth we had in the last 75 years. If we do \nget the kind of growth we had in the economy in the last 75 years, \nSocial Security is fine for the next 75 years with no adjustments \nneeded. But if we get only 1.9 percent economic growth, as the Social \nSecurity actuaries predict, we will have to make some adjustments--but \nnot major adjustments and not major surgery.\n\n  The President and others are using terms such as ``broke,'' \n``bankrupt,'' ``flat busted,'' in order to demonstrate that something \nhas to be done with Social Security. Yet he is offering nothing that \nwould address the solvency of Social Security. Nothing. He is \nproposing, instead, the creation of private accounts using a portion of \nthe Social Security money. Unfortunately, this would increase the \nproblem in Social Security.\n  We need to have and will have a very aggressive debate about this \nissue. My feeling is that we ought to do two things: One, we ought to \npreserve and protect Social Security. It is a program that has worked, \nand it continues to work well. It is the bedrock social insurance that \nthe elderly rely upon when they reach retirement age. When they reach \nthis point at which they are no longer working and have diminished \nincome, Social Security is what they can depend on to keep them out of \npoverty.\n  Some say: Let's decide to put some of that money in the stock market. \nWell, I am all for private accounts, but not in the Social Security \nsystem. We have 401(k)s, IRAs, pension programs, and Keogh programs. We \nhave done a lot to incentivize private accounts. We now provide about \n$140 billion per year in tax incentives to encourage the use of these \nretirement accounts.\n  We ought to continue providing these incentives, and even increase \nthem, but not in Social Security. Social Security is not an investment \naccount; it is an insurance account. It has always been an insurance \naccount.\n  A leading spokesperson on the far right said the following a couple \nof weeks ago: Social Security is the soft underbelly of the welfare \nstate. Well, if you believe that, then I understand why you do not want \nSocial Security, why you do not like Social Security, why you would \nlike to take it apart. I understand that. I respect that view, even if \nit is dreadfully wrong. We need to respect different viewpoints. There \nis no reason for all of us to think the same thing all the time.\n  Someone once said: When everyone is thinking the same thing, no one \nis thinking very much. So I understand and respect people with \ndifferent viewpoints. If you never liked Social Security, if you \nbelieve it is part of the welfare state as opposed to an enormously \nsuccessful social insurance program that has worked for 70 years to \nlift the elderly out of poverty, if you really believe it is unworthy \nand you want to take it apart, I understand that. But I do not agree. I \nbelieve we need to fight as hard as we can to oppose those who would \ndismantle Social Security.\n  It is safe to say that none of the people I have ever heard speak \nagainst Social Security will ever need it. None of them will ever need \nit. Almost all of them speak from a position of financial solvency. In \nmost cases, they have the gift of a very solid financial background. \nWell, good for them.\n  But maybe they should understand there are a lot of folks in this \ncountry who reach those declining income years and do not have very \nmuch. They worked hard and led good lives, but they end up with not \nvery much.\n  Their aspiration was not to make as much money as they could; it was \nto serve their community. But they did not end up with very much. The \nsame is true with a lot of people. They live a good life, do good \nthings, help other people, but they do not end up with a lot.\n  A friend of mine died about 2 months ago. He was an older man. He was \nclose\n\n[[Page S1255]]\n\nto 90 years old. He had a great life. He was a wonderful man.\n  After his funeral, his wife sent me a note. She said, very simply: \nOscar always helped his neighbors, and he always looked out for those \nwho were not so well off. That is all she said.\n  I thought, what a wonderful thing to say about someone's life. He \nalways helped his neighbors and always looked out for those who were \nnot so well off. What a great life. He did not make a lot of money, he \ndid not die with a huge estate, but he had a great life.\n  So does Social Security--the social insurance program that he and \nothers know will be there when they reach retirement--enrich their \nlives, make their lives better, allow them to depend on something that \nwill be there? You bet it does. It is important.\n  I find it interesting that the chant and the mantra in this town, \nfrom the White House, yes, and from some of our colleagues, is that the \nmost important thing for us to do is to eliminate the tax on inherited \nwealth. They say you have to eliminate what they call the death tax. \nBut there is no death tax. That is just something a pollster came up \nwith.\n  My colleague Phil Gramm from Texas was on the floor once, and I \nexplained to him, were he to die, his wife would own his entire estate, \nwith no tax. So he must be exempt. The fact is, there is no death tax. \nWhen one spouse dies, the other spouse has a 100-percent exemption, and \nthey own all those assets.\n  There is, however, a tax not on death but on inherited wealth, in \ncertain circumstances. So what we have is a proposal to eliminate the \ntax on inherited wealth, which would largely benefit the folks who have \naccumulated the most wealth in this country.\n  We have about half of the world's billionaires living in the United \nStates, and good for us, and good for them. Most of that money \naccumulated by billionaires is a result of appreciation in stocks, and \nhas never been subjected to a tax.\n  Our colleagues have created this wonderful little description of the \nestate tax or the tax on inherited wealth. They have now described it \nas a death tax. And they are on the floor of the Senate saying that \nwhen Donald Trump, for example, passes on and moves to another life, \nhis estate should not be taxed. I would not normally use a name, but \nDonald Trump is a wonderful and very successful businessman. He likes \nto have people use his name, so I am sure he will not mind if I use his \nname.\n  I think the fight to repeal the tax on inherited wealth is an \ninteresting one. At the very same time, the administration says: We \nthink we are desperately short of money to help pay for the basic \nSocial Security benefits for the low-income elderly who have reached \nretirement age.\n  Oh, we have plenty of energy to repeal the tax on inherited wealth \nfor the richest Americans, but we do not have the will to make sure \nthat Social Security will be there when you retire. I believe it is a \nmatter of values, a matter of choice, and a matter of priorities.\n  Some will say: Well, if all you are doing is supporting Social \nSecurity, you are just old-fashioned. There are some timeless truths in \nlife. It seems to me that standing up for something that has so \ndramatically improved life in this country is a timeless truth. And \nit's one that I would like to be a part of.\n  Before Social Security was enacted, one-half of the elderly in \nAmerica were poor. They were living in poverty. Today that figure is \nless than 10 percent. This program is often the only support for those \nwho reach retirement age.\n  I cannot tell you how many times I have been to meetings when someone \nhas come up to me, at the end of a meeting in North Dakota, very often \nin a small town--very often a woman living alone--who talks about how \nimportant that Social Security check is. They tell me that it \ndetermines whether they can buy groceries or pay the rent and have the \nopportunity to continue to live alone. It is so important and has been \nsuch a benefit for so many lives.\n  Now, I am for change when change advances our interests and lifts our \ncountry. I am for private accounts if they are outside of Social \nSecurity. I encourage people to provide more for their retirement \nsecurity by investing more in IRAs and 401(k)s. But I am not for anyone \nwho wants to take apart the basic Social Security program.\n  One of my colleagues calls this an ``evidence-free zone'' here in \nWashington, DC, that despite the evidence, people use whatever rhetoric \nthey want to use. Well the evidence is pretty clear. The President says \nthat if you could take a part of Social Security, invest it in private \naccounts, you will have this wonderful nirvana with dramatic returns in \nprivate accounts, and you will all end up with a lot of money.\n  The problem is this: The President believes the Social Security \nsystem is in crisis because the actuaries in the Social Security \nprogram predict that rather than the 3.4-percent economic growth we \nhave had for the past 75 years, we will only have 1.9-percent economic \ngrowth in the next 75 years. If you have 1.9-percent economic growth \nfor 75 years, you are not going to get the kind of corporate profits \nthat lift the stock market and provides returns in private accounts.\n  You cannot have it both ways. Either you have an economy that is \nrobust and growing, in which case you do not have a Social Security \nfunding issue, or you have 1.9-percent economic growth, dramatically \nbelow what we have previously experienced, and you cannot possibly get \nan adequate return in private accounts. You cannot have it both ways. \nYet the administration and others continue to argue both sides of that \nissue.\n  This is a big issue and important issue. There is plenty of room for \ndisagreement. I believe passionately and strongly in this issue. I \nbelieve the Social Security program is not, as those on the far right \nwould say, the soft underbelly of the welfare state. I don't believe \nthat at all.\n  This is something that has allowed all Americans to contribute from \ntheir paychecks something called FICA. The ``I'' stands for insurance, \nbecause this is an insurance program. I believe this has worked well \nfor over 7 decades. And it can and will work well for 10 and 20 decades \nfrom now if we have the will and the nerve and the strength to stand up \nfor the foundation of this nation's retirement security system.\n  We will have aggressive debates in the coming days and weeks. I come \nfrom a state that has a lot at stake in this Social Security debate. We \nhave a higher percentage of people aged 85 years and older than any \nother state. I have previously mentioned my uncle who has been running \nfoot races, has 43 gold medals, running in the Senior Olympics all over \nthe country, who discovered when he was 72 that he could run faster \nthan anybody his age. His experience illustrates the fact that people \nare living longer, and good for them.\n  Part of what has enriched their lives is being able to retire knowing \nthat Social Security will be there for them. It is the guarantee and \nthe promise this country has kept and will continue to keep in the \nfuture.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). The Senator from Delaware.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/10/senate-section/article/S1255-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1255-S1256]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             BIPARTISANSHIP\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I have just returned to the Senate Chamber \nfrom a press conference that took place one floor above us in the press \ngallery. There Democratic and Republican Senators, some of our staff, \nand a number of reporters discussed the passage of the class action \nreform bill by a 72-to-26 margin a few moments ago. That was a strong \nbipartisan vote. I was hoping that we might get 70, maybe even 75 \nvotes, and we ended up right in that neighborhood.\n  A lot of people deserve credit for the success of the vote: \nDemocratic and Republican Senators who crafted the legislation, debated \nit in committee, and who improved it over the last 7 years since the \nfirst bill was introduced. The key to getting the legislation passed--\nand it is a fair compromise--was figuring out how to set aside our \npartisanship, saying that we are not interested in gridlock, and for us \nto reach across the aisle, Democrats and Republicans and Republicans \nand Democrats, to figure out how we can reconcile our differences and \nresolve what has been a very divisive issue for the past 7 years and \neven before that.\n  I said at the press conference--I say here today--my thanks to our \nleader. I\n\n[[Page S1256]]\n\nthanked Senator Frist, the Republican leader. I express my thanks to \nSenator Harry Reid for his willingness to allow this vote to go \nforward. The class action bill was not legislation that he endorsed, \nbut he was willing to allow the debate to begin and for those who had \namendments to the bill to offer the amendments, that we would have \nplenty of time to debate them and to decide the amendments, and then \nwithout any kind of delaying tactics the Senate would go to final \npassage and take up the bill. I thank him for the very constructive and \npositive role he played in allowing this legislation to be passed \ntoday.\n  The House of Representatives has agreed to accept without change the \nbill we have passed. The President has agreed to sign that legislation.\n  I was saddened last night to be reading through my mail and to come \nacross a 29-page document that I believe has been distributed by the \nRepublican National Committee. There is a picture of Senator Harry Reid \non the cover, along with our former leader, Senator Tom Daschle. The \ncaption under the picture says: ``Who is Harry Reid?'' And below that \nwe read: ``Sen. Minority Leader determined to obstruct President Bush's \nagenda.'' For the next 28, 29 pages, this document is an attempt to \nidentify Harry Reid or to try to define who he is and where he is from, \nhis values. I think it is 29 pages of something more akin to venom.\n  If we are interested in building on the bipartisanship that \ncharacterized this week's debate and today's vote on class action \nreform, those goals are not enhanced or strengthened by this kind of \ntactic.\n  I say to my Republican friends--and I don't believe this came from \nanybody in this Chamber, but it is from someone our Republicans know \nand work with, people who work for the President or indirectly--if you \nwant Democrats to work with you and find common ground on issues such \nas class action or energy or asbestos or other difficult issues, \nbankruptcy, this is not the way to do it. If you want to make sure that \nwe have obstructionism, that we have a lack of bipartisanship, if you \nwant to ensure that the climate of the last several years where we got \nso little done returns, this is the way to do it.\n  Whoever is responsible for this, let me just say: Shame on you. \nRepublicans can do better than this. And to the extent that Democrats \nare responsible for this kind of behavior on our side, shame on us.\n  I came here 4 years ago from Delaware, which is a little State, such \nas the State of the Presiding Officer. In our State we have a history \nof Democrats and Republicans working across the aisle, trying to find \ncommon ground and, more often than not, succeeding. This sort of thing \nwould not be tolerated in my State by either Democrats or Republicans. \nThis is not the way we do business. One of the reasons Delaware is so \nsuccessful is because of that bipartisan tradition that is part of our \nfiber.\n  I hope that we won't see this kind of attack on our leader, and I \ncertainly hope we don't see it on the Republican leader. The \nRepublicans are better than this. So are the Democrats.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Craig pertaining to the introduction of S. 359 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/10/senate-section/article/S1256-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1256]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation.

Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to \nhighlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  On July 17, 2004, Donald Brockman, Darren Gay, Shawn Regan and an \nunidentified 16-year-old boy accompanied another man home after leaving \na bar in Austin, TX.

COLVIN\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I would like to recognize the \nsignificant achievements of Joe F. Colvin, who is retiring as president \nand chief executive officer of the Nuclear Energy Institute, and \nacknowledge his many noteworthy contributions in building a strong \nfuture for nuclear energy, America's largest emission-free electricity \nsource.\n  As chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, it \nhas been my distinct pleasure to work closely with Mr. Colvin and his \norganization. I can personally attest to his leadership in guiding the \nnuclear energy industry through a period of extraordinary renaissance.\n  Mr. Colvin has provided more than 40 years of service to our Nation, \nfirst as a submarine office in the U.S. Navy and later in the \ncommercial nuclear energy industry.\n  When he took the helm at NEI in 1996, conventional thinking was that \nthe industry was stagnant and nuclear power had no future in America's \nenergy mix. He rejected that view and tirelessly worked to advance \nnuclear energy's true capabilities--its proven safety, its contribution \nto our environment and its affordability.\n  After more than 20 years of debate, Congress passed legislation in \n2002 designating Yucca Mountain as the site of Nation's used fuel \nrepository giving our Nation clear direction for our used fuel \nmanagement program.\n  Today, America's nuclear plants are now recognized as the significant \nassets they are, and the nuclear energy industry is more competitive \nthan ever. In addition, several companies are testing an improved \nlicensing process for new nuclear power plants.\n  Although Mr. Colvin is quick to acknowledge the accomplishments of \nothers, his own work on behalf of the nuclear energy industry has paid \nenormous dividends. Through frequent testimony before congressional \ncommittees, conversations with senior Government officials and \ncountless others, he has educated many about the value of nuclear \nenergy and the promise it holds.\n  Hence, it is with mixed emotions that I wish Mr. Colvin, a great \nUniversity of New Mexico Lobo, all the best in his retirement from the \nNuclear Energy Institute. He has earned a well-deserved respite.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/10/senate-section/article/S1256-3", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1256-S1257]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        PHARMACEUTICAL MARKET ACCESS AND FAIR TRADE ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the introduction \nof an important piece of legislation that will greatly aid Americans, \nboth young and old, with their health care costs. I, along with a \nbipartisan group of Senators, have introduced the Pharmaceutical Market \nAccess and Fair Trade Act of 2005. This legislation would provide much \nneeded assistance for millions of Americans who are struggling to pay \nfor their prescription drugs.\n  American consumers are currently charged 55 percent more, on average, \nfor the same brand-name medicines sold in other major developed \ncountries for a fraction of the price. The Pharmaceutical Market Access \nand Fair Trade Act of 2005 would allow American consumers to benefit \nfrom international price competition for prescription medicines through \nthe reimportation of FDA-approved prescription drugs. This legislation \nallows U.S.-licensed pharmacies and drug wholesalers to\n\n[[Page S1257]]\n\nimport medications from Canada, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and \nJapan and pass along the savings to their American customers. This \napproach would allow Americans to benefit from lower prices on their \nprescription drugs while still enabling them to use their local \npharmacy. The bill also allows individual consumers to import \nprescription drugs for their own personal use.\n  One of the leading arguments against reimportation has been concerns \nover safety of the prescription drugs that are sold abroad. My \ncolleagues and I have addressed this issue by providing strict safety \nmeasures in this legislation which are intended to guarantee that only \nsafe, effective FDA-approved prescription drugs are imported. Such \nprovisions would require pharmacies and drug wholesalers to register \nwith the FDA and be subject to frequent, random inspections. It would \nallow only the importation of FDA-approved medicines with a ``chain of \ncustody'' that can be traced all the way back to an FDA-inspected \nmanufacturing plant. It would provide for the use of the \nanticounterfeiting technology to identify safe, legal imported \nmedicines, as well as give the FDA resources and authority it needs to \nensure the safety of imported drugs and to stop those that are unsafe.\n  It is very important that the bill this Congress takes up and passes \nwill not only become law but also ensure that reimportation is actually \nallowed to occur. This bill ensures that by including features to \nprevent a drug company from blocking importation by making subtle \nchanges to a drug, such as changing the color or the place of \nmanufacture, so that it is no longer FDA approved.\n  It is about time that the Senate takes up this legislation and passes \nit. It has broad bipartisan support and has been subjected to intense \ndiscussion, review, and debate. We are now faced with health care costs \nnationwide that are spiraling out of control, and we need to take \naction to address this issue. Allowing the safe reimportation of \nprescription drugs is a step in the right direction. The majority of \nthe American people support reimportation, and I hope the leadership of \nthis body will listen to them and finally provide the relief our \ncitizens need.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/10/senate-section/article/S1257-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1257]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          COMMISSION ON MEDICAID AND THE MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED\n\n  Mr. CHAFFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Gordon Smith \nand others in the introduction of a bipartisan proposal that calls for \nthe creation of a Commission on Medicaid and the Medically Underserved. \nThis legislation recognizes the importance of assessing what aspects of \nthe Medicaid program are working, which need reform, and how to improve \nservice delivery and quality in the most cost effective manner \npossible. In this tight budget climate this bill highlights the need \nfor a comprehensive assessment of the Medicaid program. The future of \nMedicaid cannot be determined by cost alone.\n  This Medicaid commission would be charged with numerous duties, \nincluding reviewing and making recommendations on long-term goals of \nthe program, populations served, financial sustainability, interaction \nwith Medicare and the uninsured, and the quality of care provided. \nMedicaid is a critically important program that helps meet the health \ncare needs of a diverse population. Namely it serves as a source of \ntraditional insurance for poor children and some of their parents, it \npays for an acute and long term care services for the elderly and \ndisabled, wraps around coverage or assistance for low-income seniors \nand the disabled on Medicare, and serves as the primary source of \nfunding for safety net providers serving Medicaid patients and the \nuninsured.\n  In recognition of the diverse population Medicaid serves, the \nMedicaid commission would be comprised of 23 members representing all \nthe stakeholders in the Medicaid program. The commission has 1 year to \nhold public hearings, conduct evaluations and deliberations, and issue \nits report recommendations to the President, Congress and the public.\n  Like many of our Nation's governors, I agree that the Medicaid \nprogram needs a careful assessment with an eye toward reform that will \nmake the program financially sustainable. At the same time, I recognize \nthe importance of not fundamentally altering the structure of program \nwithout the deliberation necessary to preserve aspects of the program \nthat are working. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting Senator \nSmith's legislation to help bring Medicaid into the 21st century with \nreforms driven by efficacy, and not simply the cost of the program.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/10/senate-section/article/S1257-2", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1257]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n HONORING THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF WEST KENTUCKY COMMUNITY AND TECHNICAL \n                                COLLEGE\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

Mr. President, last month the Brady Campaign to \nPrevent Gun Violence, in partnership with the Million Mom March and a \nnumber of State gun safety groups, released its 8th Annual Report Card \non State Gun Laws Protecting Children. I applaud the efforts of these \norganizations to keep the pressure on State and local legislators to \nenact sensible gun safety legislation, and I encourage my colleagues to \nreview this report.\n  The Brady Campaign report assigns individual States a grade of A \nthrough F on seven types of laws that protect children from gun \nviolence. ``Extra credit'' and ``demerits'' were also assigned for \nother State gun safety laws.\n\n[[Page S1258]]\n\nThe Brady Campaign includes in its analysis such questions as: Is it \nillegal for a child to possess a gun without supervision? Is it illegal \nto sell a gun to a child? Are gun owners held responsible for leaving \nloaded guns easily accessible to children? Are guns required to have \nchild-safety locks, loaded-chamber indicators and other childproof \ndesigns? Do cities and counties have authority to enact local gun \nsafety laws? Are background checks required at gun shows? And, is it \nlegal to carry concealed handguns in public?\n  Children around the country continue to be at great risk from gun \nviolence. This year, the Brady Campaign awarded only six States an A \nrating in their report. Unfortunately, 31 States received grades of D \nor F. Only one State improved its grade from last year, while two \nothers took actions that will make communities less safe from the \nthreat of gun violence. However, I was encouraged that the number of \n``extra credit Sensible Safety Stars'' for protecting children from gun \nviolence more than doubled to 21, and that the number of ``Time-Out \nChair demerits'' assigned for weakening State gun laws was cut from ten \nto six.\n  While some States have taken positive steps on the issue of gun \nsafety in the last year, more than half are still receiving failing \ngrades from the Brady Campaign. By passing legislation that reduces \nchild firearm deaths, Congress can help to improve the grades of these \nStates. I urge my colleagues to take up and pass common sense gun \nsafety legislation that will close the gun show loophole, reauthorize \nthe 1994 assault weapons ban, and improve child gun access prevention \nlaws.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/10/senate-section/article/S1258-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1258]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/10/senate-section/article/S1258-2", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1258]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EXECUTIVE MESSAGE REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \na message from the President of the United States submitting a \nnomination which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  (The nomination received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/10/senate-section/article/S1258-3", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1258-S1259]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, and were referred as \nindicated:\n\n       EC-664.

A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to revise the \nage and service requirements for eligibility to receive retired pay for \nnon-regular service, to expand certain authorities to provide health \ncare benefits for Reserves and their families, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have long recognized that our country has \nan obligation to take care of the brave men and women who wear the \nuniform of the United States--and their families.\n  Sixty years ago we passed the GI Bill of Rights for the 16 million \nveterans who served in WorId War II. By providing new opportunities in \nhousing and education, we helped them return to civilian life.\n  Our military forces have changed dramatically since then--but the \nbenefits we offer to military families haven't kept pace with the \nchanges.\n  Today our military relies on volunteers, and our security depends on \nrecruiting and retaining good troops--including members of the National \nGuard and Reserves.\n  The Guard and Reserves serve at the command of State governors, but \nmembers are also available to be called to active duty by the \nPresident. And over the last 10 years, the role of the National Guard \nand Reserves in our military has steadily increased.\n  Today, reports indicate that almost half of the forces deployed in \nsupport of Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom come \nfrom the National Guard and the Reserves.\n  These Guardsmen and Reservists are not only providing much-needed \n``boots on the ground.'' They bring specific skills that our regular \nactive military cannot duplicate.\n  For example, in my home state of Nevada, half of the pilots in the \nNevada Air National Guard are civilian pilots.\n  A majority of the Nevada National Guard military police, who are in \nthe 72nd MP Company that just returned from Iraq, work as law \nenforcement officers in Las Vegas.\n  And the Nevada Army Guard's 126th Medical Company an air ambulance\n\n[[Page S1262]]\n\nunit, which flew more than 174 traumatic medical evacuations in \nAfghanistan, is made up entirely of men and women who work as civilian \nparamedics.\n  So the National Guard and Reserves are strengthened by the fact that \nmembers hold civilian jobs as pilots, police officers and paramedics.\n  The Guard and Reserves also provide the primary service--or the only \nservice--in several crucial areas of national security, including: port \nsecurity; airport security; civil support teams; and reconnaissance and \nDrug Air Interdiction.\n  Since we rely more than ever on members of our National Guard and \nReserves, we need to modernize the benefits that are available to \nthem--especially in the areas of retirement and health care.\n  Let's start with health care.\n  It's true that service in the Guard and Reserve is a part time \nobligation--but it is unlike any other part-time job that a person \nmight hold.\n  When the Guard and Reserves call, members must put their duty above \ntheir regular jobs and even their families. That means taking time off \nfrom their regular jobs . . . and forgoing many family activities \nbecause they are busy fulfilling their Guard or reserve duties.\n  And it means being ready for deployment at any time.\n  In short, we expect members to make the Guard and Reserves a top \npriority in their lives.\n  In return for that commitment . . . for the sacrifices they make at \ntheir regular jobs . . . we owe them the peace of mind of knowing that \ntheir families will receive quality medical care.\n  We need to offer medical care that leverages the existing military \nhealth care system. That is why TRICARE should be an option for all \nmembers of the National Guard and Reserves.\n  The lack of health care benefits for Guard and Reserve members is a \nserious problem. Currently, about 40 percent of the enlisted members \ndon't have any health care coverage.\n  This affects troop readiness. In recent mobilizations, 10 to 15 \npercent of the Guard and Reserve members could not be deployed due to \nhealth-related issues.\n  It also affects the state of mind of those who are training for \ndangerous deployments. A Reservist in training on the weekend shouldn't \nbe worried about whether his or her sick child will be able to see a \ndoctor.\n  Providing better health care benefits to members of the Guard and \nReserve is not only the right thing to do--it's a matter of national \nsecurity.\n  We just also upgrade the retirement benefits available to those who \nchoose to serve for long periods of time.\n  A person who serves in the Guard or Reserve for 20 years is subject \nto being called up to active duty numerous times, disrupting his or her \ncivilian career and retirement planning.\n  We must take this into account, and improve the retirement benefits \nfor Guard and Reserve members.\n  The current reserve retirement system is 50 years old, and it doesn't \nreflect the extent to which our nation now depends on the National \nGuard and Reserves.\n  This outdated system doesn't allow members to receive retired pay or \nretiree health benefits until they are 60 years old. We must update the \nsystem so those who serve can receive benefits at age 55, if they meet \nall the other requirements.\n  This change would recognize the importance of the Guard and Reserves \nin today's military . . . and it would recognize the sacrifices that \nmembers make in their civilian careers in order to serve their country.\n  Once again, this is not only the right thing to do--it will make our \ncountry stronger and safer by encouraging and rewarding service in the \nNational Guard and Reserves.\n\n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Obama, Mr. Bayh, and \n        Mr. Lugar):\n  S. 341. A bill to provide for the redesign of the reverse of the \nLincoln 1-cent coin in 2009 in commemoration of the 200th anniversary \nof the birth of President Abraham Lincoln; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to honor \nAbraham Lincoln in 2009, the bicentennial of his birth, by issuing a \nseries of 1-cent coins with designs on the reverse that are emblematic \nof the 4 major periods of his life, in Kentucky, Indiana, Illinois, and \nWashington, D.C. The bill would also provide for a longer-term redesign \nof the reverse of 1-cent coins so that after 2009 they will bear an \nimage emblematic of Lincoln's preservation of the United States as a \nsingle and united country.\n  Abraham Lincoln was one of our greatest leaders, demonstrating \nenormous courage and strength of character during the Civil War, \nperhaps the greatest crisis in our Nation's history. Lincoln was born \nin Kentucky, grew to adulthood in Indiana, achieved fame in Illinois, \nand led the Nation in Washington, DC. He rose to the Presidency through \na combination of honesty, integrity, intelligence, and commitment to \nthe United States.\n  Adhering to the belief that all men are created equal, Lincoln led \nthe effort to free all slaves in the United States. Despite the great \npassions aroused by the Civil War, Lincoln had a generous heart and \nacted with malice toward none and with charity for all. Lincoln made \nthe ultimate sacrifice for the country he loved, dying from an \nassassin's bullet on April 15, 1865. All Americans could benefit from \nstudying the life of Abraham Lincoln.\n  The ``Lincoln cent'' was introduced in 1909 on the 100th anniversary \nof Lincoln's birth, making the front design by sculptor Victor David \nBrenner the most enduring image on the Nation's coinage. President \nTheodore Roosevelt was so impressed by Brenner's talent that he was \nchosen to design the likeness of Lincoln for the coin, adapting a \ndesign from a plaque Brenner had prepared earlier. In the nearly 100 \nyears of production of the ``Lincoln cent,'' there have been only two \ndesigns on the reverse: the original, featuring two wheat-heads, and \nthe current representation of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, DC.\n  On the occasion of the bicentennial of Lincoln's birth and the 100th \nanniversary of the production of the Lincoln cent, we should recognize \nhis great achievement in ensuring that the United States remained one \nNation, united and inseparable.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 341\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial \n     1-Cent Coin Redesign Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President, was one of the \n     Nation's greatest leaders, demonstrating true courage during \n     the Civil War, one of the greatest crises in the Nation's \n     history.\n       (2) Born of humble roots in Hardin County, Kentucky, on \n     February 12, 1809, Abraham Lincoln rose to the Presidency \n     through a combination of honesty, integrity, intelligence, \n     and commitment to the United States.\n       (3) With the belief that all men are created equal, Abraham \n     Lincoln led the effort to free all slaves in the United \n     States.\n       (4) Abraham Lincoln had a generous heart, with malice \n     toward none and with charity for all.\n       (5) Abraham Lincoln gave the ultimate sacrifice for the \n     country he loved, dying from an assassin's bullet on April \n     15, 1865.\n       (6) All Americans could benefit from studying the life of \n     Abraham Lincoln, for Lincoln's life is a model for \n     accomplishing the ``American dream'' through honesty, \n     integrity, loyalty, and a lifetime of education.\n       (7) The year 2009 will be the bicentennial anniversary of \n     the birth of Abraham Lincoln.\n       (8) Abraham Lincoln was born in Kentucky, grew to adulthood \n     in Indiana, achieved fame in Illinois, and led the nation in \n     Washington, D.C.\n       (9) The so-called ``Lincoln cent'' was introduced in 1909 \n     on the 100th anniversary of Lincoln's birth, making the \n     obverse design the most enduring on the nation's coinage.\n       (10) President Theodore Roosevelt was so impressed by the \n     talent of Victor David\n\n[[Page S1263]]\n\n     Brenner that the sculptor was chosen to design the likeness \n     of President Lincoln for the coin, adapting a design from a \n     plaque Brenner had prepared earlier.\n       (11) In the nearly 100 years of production of the ``Lincoln \n     cent'', there have been only 2 designs on the reverse: the \n     original, featuring 2 wheat-heads in memorial style enclosing \n     mottoes, and the current representation of the Lincoln \n     Memorial in Washington, D.C.\n       (12) On the occasion of the bicentennial of President \n     Lincoln's birth and the 100th anniversary of the production \n     of the Lincoln cent, it is entirely fitting to issue a series \n     of 1-cent coins with designs on the reverse that are \n     emblematic of the 4 major periods of President Lincoln's \n     life.\n\n     SEC. 3. REDESIGN OF LINCOLN CENT FOR 2009.\n\n       (a) In General.--During the year 2009, the Secretary of the \n     Treasury shall issue 1-cent coins in accordance with the \n     following design specifications:\n       (1) Obverse.--The obverse of the 1-cent coin shall continue \n     to bear the Victor David Brenner likeness of President \n     Abraham Lincoln.\n       (2) Reverse.--The reverse of the coins shall bear 4 \n     different designs each representing a different aspect of the \n     life of Abraham Lincoln, such as--\n       (A) his birth and early childhood in Kentucky;\n       (B) his formative years in Indiana;\n       (C) his professional life in Illinois; and\n       (D) his presidency, in Washington, D.C.\n       (b) Issuance of Redesigned Lincoln Cents in 2009.--\n       (1) Order.--The 1-cent coins to which this section applies \n     shall be issued with 1 of the 4 designs referred to in \n     subsection (a)(2) beginning at the start of each calendar \n     quarter of 2009.\n       (2) Number.--The Secretary shall prescribe, on the basis of \n     such factors as the Secretary determines to be appropriate, \n     the number of 1-cent coins that shall be issued with each of \n     the designs selected for each calendar quarter of 2009.\n       (c) Design Selection.--The designs for the coins specified \n     in this section shall be chosen by the Secretary--\n       (1) after consultation with the Abraham Lincoln \n     Bicentennial Commission and the Commission of Fine Arts; and\n       (2) after review by the Citizens Coinage Advisory \n     Committee.\n\n     SEC. 4. REDESIGN OF REVERSE OF 1-CENT COINS AFTER 2009.\n\n       The design on the reverse of the 1-cent coins issued after \n     December 31, 2009, shall bear an image emblematic of \n     President Lincoln's preservation of the United States of \n     America as a single and united country.\n\n     SEC. 5. NUMISMATIC PENNIES WITH THE SAME METALLIC CONTENT AS \n                   THE 1909 PENNY.\n\n       The Secretary of the Treasury shall issue 1-cent coins in \n     2009 with the exact metallic content as the 1-cent coin \n     contained in 1909 in such number as the Secretary determines \n     to be appropriate for numismatic purposes.\n\n     SEC. 6. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS.\n\n        It is the sense of the Congress that the original Victor \n     David Brenner design for the 1-cent coin was a dramatic \n     departure from previous American coinage that should be \n     reproduced, using the original form and relief of the \n     likeness of Abraham Lincoln, on the 1-cent coins issued in \n     2009.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Lieberman, Ms. Snowe, Mrs. \n        Feinstein, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Lautenberg, Mrs. Murray, \n        Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. Corzine, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Kerry, \n        and Mr. Dayton):\n  S. 342. A bill to provide for a program of scientific research on \nabrupt climate change, to accelerate the reduction of greenhouse gas \nemissions in the United States by establishing a market-driven system \nof greenhouse gas tradeable allowances, to limit greenhouse gas \nemissions in the United States and reduce dependence upon foreign oil, \nand ensure benefits to consumers from the trading in such allowances; \nto the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to be joined with \nSenator Lieberman in introducing the Climate Stewardship Act of 2005. \nThis bill is nearly identical to a proposal we offered during the 108th \nCongress. It is designed to begin a meaningful and shared effort among \nthe emission-producing sectors of our country to address the world's \ngreatest environmental challenge--climate change.\n  The National Academy of Sciences reported:\n\n       Greenhouse gases are accumulating in the Earth's atmosphere \n     as a result of human activities, causing surface air \n     temperatures and subsurface ocean temperatures to rise. \n     Temperatures are, in fact, rising. The changes observed over \n     the last several decades are likely mostly due to human \n     activities.\n\n  Again, ``temperatures are, in fact, rising.'' Those are the words of \nthe National Academy of Sciences, a body created by the Congress in \n1863 to provide advice to the Federal Government on scientific and \ntechnical matters. These comments were written after much thoughtful \ndeliberation and should not be taken lightly. The Academy has a 140-\nyear history and a strong reputation of service to the people of this \ngreat country.\n  In October 2003, in response to the alarming changes in the climate \nthat are being reported worldwide, we were joined by a number of other \nSenators in the first offering of our proposal for addressing climate \nchange for Senate consideration. We had a hard-fought debate and found \nourselves eight votes short of achieving a majority in passage. Today, \nwe resume what we finally can consider a worthy and necessary cause.\n  I state at the outset that this issue is not going away. This issue \nis one of transcendent importance outside the boundaries of the United \nStates of America. If you travel to Europe today and visit with our \nEuropean friends, you will find that climate change/Kyoto treaty are \nmajor sources of dissatisfaction on that side of the Atlantic with the \nUnited States of America and its policies. But far more important than \nthat, the overwhelming body of scientific evidence shows that climate \nchange is real, that it is happening as we speak. The Arctic and \nAntarctic are the ``miner's canary'' of climate change, and profound \nand terrible things are happening at the poles, not to mention other \nparts of the world.\n  Democracies usually respond to crises when they are faced with them \nand, at least in the case of this Nation, we address problems and \ncrises that confront us and we move on. We are not very good at long-\nterm planning and long-term addressing of issues that face us in the \nfuture. The divisions concerning the issue of Social Security are \nclearly an example of what I just said.\n\n  If we do not move on this issue, our children and grandchildren are \ngoing to pay an incredibly heavy price because this crisis is upon us, \nonly we do not see its visible aspects in all of its enormity.\n  Prime Minister Tony Blair, assuming the stewardship of the G-8, has \nmade it his highest priority. He has very aptly pointed out: Suppose \nthat all of the scientific opinion is wrong; suppose that the ice that \nis breaking up in the Antarctic in huge chunks is just something which \nis temporary; suppose that the glaciers receding in the Arctic at a \nhigher rate than at any time in history is something that is a one-time \ndeal; suppose that the melting of the permafrost in Alaska and the \nInuit villages collapsing into the ocean is a one-time thing; suppose \nthese increases in violent climate occurrences are all something that \nare just temporary aberrations; suppose that happens to be true and we \nhave acted. Then the world and the Nation will be better off because we \nwould have developed technologies which are cleaner. We would have \ntaken actions to reduce what everybody agrees is harmful, and that is \nexcess greenhouse gases. And the Nation and the world would be better \noff.\n  But suppose the scientists are right. Suppose that the National \nAcademy of Sciences report that says, ``Greenhouse gases are \naccumulating in the Earth's atmosphere as a result of human activities. \nTemperatures are, in fact, rising. The changes observed over the last \nseveral decades are likely mostly due to human activities[ . . . ]'' is \nright; suppose that Dr. Robert Corell, chair of the Arctic Climate \nImpact Assessment, assessing the economic impacts and consequences of \nthe changing Arctic, and the Arctic Council, composed of the senior \nofficials from the eight Arctic countries that reached the conclusion \nthat the Arctic climate is changing rapidly; that over the past 50 \nyears, temperatures across Alaska, Canada, and much of Russia have \nincreased 3 to 5 degrees Fahrenheit, with winter temperatures in these \nareas increasing by up to 7 degrees Fahrenheit; that in the past 30 \nyears, the Arctic has lost an area of annual average sea ice larger \nthan all of Arizona and Texas combined, with even stronger declines \nobserved in summer sea ice; that mountain glaciers have also receded \ndramatically, and the snow cover season\n\n[[Page S1264]]\n\nhas been shrinking; that greenhouse gas concentration continues to \nrise; and even larger changes in climate are projected for the next 100 \nyears; suppose they are right.\n  The observed warming is already having significant impacts on Arctic \npeople and ecosystems. Much larger projected climate changes will \nresult in even greater impacts on the people in the Arctic and beyond. \nIncreasing coastal erosion threatens many Alaskan villages. Warming is \nalso affecting the oil industry. The number of days in which oil \nexploration and extraction activities on the tundra are allowed under \nAlaska Department of Natural Resources standards has been halved over \nthe past 30 years.\n  The projected changes in Arctic climate will also have global \nimplications. Amplified global warming, rising sea levels, and \npotential alterations in ocean circulation patterns that can have \nlarge-scale climatic effects are among the global concerns. Melting \nArctic snow and ice cause additional absorption of solar energy by the \ndarker land surface, amplifying the warming trend at the global scale.\n\n  Recently, the Australians have predicted that the Great Barrier Reef \nwill be dead by 2050. What is the impact of coral reefs around the \nworld being bleached and dying on the food chain?\n  Dr. William Fraser, president of Polar Oceans Research Group, \ntestified that mountain ranges flanking the southeastern boundary of \nthe glacier, not visible 30 years ago, are emerging into full view. The \namount of ice-free land along the entire southwest coast of Anver \nIsland has been redefined by glacier retreat. Populations of the ice-\navoiding Chinstrap and Gentoo penguins have increased by 55 to 90 \npercent.\n  The coral reefs are the most biologically diverse ecosystem of the \nocean, as we all know. Almost 1,000 coral species currently exist. With \nthe majority of human populations living in coastal regions, many \npeople depend on living coral reef for food and protection from storm \nsurges.\n  Dr. Lara Hansen stated:\n\n       While the Great Barrier Reef is widely considered to be one \n     of the best managed reef systems in the world, local \n     conservation actions will not be sufficient to protect coral \n     reefs from the effects of climate change. To date, studies \n     indicate that the best chance for successful conservation in \n     the face of climate change is to limit the temperature \n     increase. . . .\n\n  ADM James Watkins, who was chairman of the U.S. Commission on Ocean \nPolicy, testified that climate change impacts every topic in the report \nfrom the health and safety of humans, the health of environment and \nfisheries to the distribution of marine organisms, including pathogens. \nAdmiral Watkins, former Chief of Naval Operations and former Secretary \nof Energy, not a renowned environmentalist, went on to say climate \nchange is a serious problem, and it could affect all of the \nrecommendations from the report.\n  There will be people who will come to this floor and say that climate \nchange is a myth; it is not serious. They will find a scientist, they \nwill find some study group, some of them funded by people with special \ninterests here, but I hope that we will pay attention to Prime Minister \nTony Blair, who has made climate change one of the two issues he hopes \nto address during his presidency of the G-8. This issue I believe is \nvery well understood by a majority of scientists in America.\n  I have a couple of pictures I will show. I see my colleague from \nConnecticut is in the Chamber.\n  Recently, Dr. Rajendra Pachauri, the chairman of the U.N.'s \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, stated that he personally \nbelieves that the world has ``already reached the level of dangerous \nconcentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.''\n  He went on to say:\n\n       Climate change is for real. We have just a small window of \n     opportunity, and it is closing rapidly. There is not a moment \n     to lose.\n\n  The International Climate Change Task Force, chaired by Senator Snowe \nand the Right Honorable Stephen Byers, Member of Parliament of the \nUnited Kingdom, stated in 1 of its 10 recommendations concerning \nclimate change that ``all developed countries introduce mandatory cap-\nand-trade systems for carbon emissions and construct them to allow \nfor future integration into a single global market.'' That is already \nbeing done in Europe as we speak, which is the substance of Senator \nLieberman's and my legislation.\n\n  States are acting. Nine States in the East have signed on as full \nparticipants in this initiative to elevate climate mitigation \nstrategies from voluntary initiatives to a regulatory program. The \nState of California has approved a new State regulation aimed at \ndecreasing carbon dioxide emissions from vehicles. The States are way \nahead of us. I believe one of the reasons for that is because special \ninterests are less active in the States.\n  This is a chart that shows that the CO2 data has gone up from, as we \ncan see, 1860 to 2001.\n  This is a picture of the Arctic sea ice loss. The red outline is \n1979. This was the Arctic sea ice, which is outlined in red. We can see \nthe size of the Arctic sea ice today. I made a visit with some of my \ncolleagues to the Arctic. We took a ship and stopped at where this \nglacier was 5 years ago, traveling a number of miles and saw where that \nglacier is today.\n  I want to emphasize again, the Arctic and the Antarctic are the \nminer's canary of global warming because of the thinness of the \natmosphere there.\n  This chart is sea level changes in areas of Florida that would be \ninundated with a sea level rise.\n  I usually have--it is probably not here--I usually have a picture of \nMount Kilimanjaro, which is known to many of us.\n  This is a chart of coral bleaching which is taking place as we speak.\n  If I can add a little parochialism, if I can show a picture of Lake \nPowell in Arizona, it has been drying up since 1999, draining Lake \nPowell to well below its high watermark. It is at an alltime low in its \nseventh year. The lake has shrunk to 10 percent of its capacity.\n  The signs of climate change are all around us. We need to act. We \nneed to develop technologies and make it economically attractive for \nindustry to find it in their interest to develop technology which will \nreduce and bring into check the greenhouse gas emissions in the world.\n  We need to do a lot of things, but a cap and trade, which would put \nan end to the increase of greenhouse gases and a gradual reduction, is \nan integral part.\n  Finally, I would like to return to my other argument in closing.\n  Suppose the Senator from Connecticut and I are deluded, that all of \nthis scientific evidence, all these opinions, people such as Admiral \nWatkins in the oceans report, the National Academy of Sciences, the \nliterally hundreds of people in the scientific community with whom \nSenator Lieberman and I have met and talked are wrong.\n  Here is the picture of Kilimanjaro in 1912, 1970, and 2000.\n  Suppose we are deluded, that we are tree-hugging environmentalists \nwho have taken leave of our senses and are sounding a false alarm to \nthe world, and we go ahead and put in a cap and trade, we encourage \ntechnologies to be developed and funded, some by the Federal Government \nin the form of pure research, and we do put a cap on the greenhouse \ngases, we negotiate an alternate Kyoto Treaty with our friends \nthroughout the world--140 nations are signatories to the Kyoto Treaty--\nand we join on the provision India and China have to be included and \nother provisions which we have every right to demand, and we start \nmoving forward on this issue and we are wrong, that the year after \nnext, everything is fine in the world? Then we will have made probably \na significant contribution to the betterment of the world and the Earth \nby reducing greenhouse gases, by developing cleaner technologies, by \ndoing good things, and then Senator Lieberman and I will come to the \nfloor and apologize for sounding this alarm.\n  But suppose, Mr. President, that we are right. Suppose the National \nAcademy of Sciences is right. Suppose the eight-nation research council \nthat is deeply alarmed at these effects in both the Arctic and \nAntarctic is wrong; suppose Admiral Watkins is wrong; suppose the \nAustralian Government is wrong when it says the Great Barrier Reef is \ngoing to be dead by 2050, and we have done nothing? We have done \nrelatively nothing besides gather additional data and make reports. \nThat is what the U.S. national policy is today: gather information and \nmake reports. I\n\n[[Page S1265]]\n\nwould argue that is a pretty heavy burden to lay on future generations \nof Americans.\n  I welcome the participation, friendship, and commitment of my friend \nfrom Connecticut.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record an \narticle entitled ``Arid Arizona Points to Global Warming as Culprit,'' \nand a response to Senator Inhofe's floor statement on January 4, 2005.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Feb. 6, 2005]\n\n            Arid Arizona Points to Global Warming as Culprit\n\n                          (By Juliet Eilperin)\n\n       Tucson.--Reese Woodling remembers the mornings when he \n     would walk the grounds of his ranch and come back with his \n     clothes soaked with dew, moisture that fostered enough grass \n     to feed 500 cows and their calves.\n       But by 1993, he says, the dew was disappearing around \n     Cascabel--his 2,700-acre ranch in the Malpai borderlands \n     straddling New Mexico and Arizona--and shrubs were taking \n     over the grassland. Five years later Woodling had sold off \n     half his cows, and by 2004 he abandoned the ranch.\n       Reese Woodling, in white, used to own a 2,700-acre ranch, \n     but lack of rain reduced the grassland--his main source of \n     cattle feed.\n       ``How do you respond when the grass is dying? You hope to \n     hell it starts to rain next year,'' he says.\n       When the rain stopped coming in the 1990s, he and other \n     Southwest ranchers began to suspect there was a larger \n     weather pattern afoot. ``People started talking about how \n     we've got some major problems out here,'' he said in an \n     interview. ``Do I believe in global warming? Absolutely.''\n       Dramatic weather changes in the West--whether it is \n     Arizona's decade-long drought or this winter's torrential \n     rains in Southern California--have pushed some former \n     skeptics to reevaluate their views on climate change. A \n     number of scientists, and some Westerners, are now convinced \n     that global warming is the best explanation for the higher \n     temperatures, rapid precipitation shifts, and accelerated \n     blooming and breeding patterns that are changing the \n     Southwest, one of the nation's most vulnerable ecosystems.\n       In the face of shrinking water reservoirs, massive forest \n     fires and temperature-related disease outbreaks, several said \n     they now believe that warming is transforming their daily \n     lives. Although it has rained some during the past three \n     months, the state is still struggling with a persistent \n     drought that has hurt its economy, costing cattle-related \n     industries $2.8 billion in 2002.\n       ``Everyone's from Missouri: When they see it, they believe \n     it,'' said Gregg Garfin, who has assessed the Southwest's \n     climate for the federal government since 1998. ``When we used \n     to talk about climate, eyes would glaze over. . . . Then the \n     drought came. The phone started ringing off the hook.''\n       Jonathan Overpeck, who directs the university- and \n     government-funded Institute for the Study of Planet Earth at \n     the University of Arizona, said current drought and weather \n     disruptions signal what is to come over the next century. \n     Twenty-five years ago, he said, scientists produced computer \n     models of the drought that Arizona is now experiencing.\n       ``It's going to get warmer, we're going to have more \n     people, and we're going to have more droughts more frequently \n     and in harsher terms,'' Overpeck said. ``We should be at the \n     forefront of demanding action on global warming because we're \n     at the forefront of the impacts of global warming. . . . In \n     the West we're seeing what's happening now.''\n       There are dissenters who say it is impossible to attribute \n     the recent drought and higher temperatures to global warming. \n     Sherwood Idso, president of the Tempe, Ariz.-based Center for \n     the Study of Carbon Dioxide and Global Change, said he does \n     not believe the state's drought ``has anything to do with \n     CO2 or global warming,'' because the region \n     experienced more-severe droughts between 1600 and 1800. \n     Idso, who also said he did not believe there is a link \n     between human-generated carbon dioxide emissions and \n     climate change, declined to say who funds his center.\n       The stakes are enormous for Arizona, which is growing six \n     times faster than the national average and must meet mounting \n     demands for water and space with scarce resources. Gov. Janet \n     Napolitano (D) is urging Arizonans to embrace ``a culture of \n     conservation'' with water, but some conservationists and \n     scientists wonder whether that will be enough.\n       Dale Turner of the Nature Conservancy tracks changes in the \n     state's mountaintop ``sky islands''--a region east and south \n     of Tucson that hosts a bevy of rare plants and animals. Human \n     activities over the past century have degraded local \n     habitats, Turner said, and now climate change threatens to \n     push these populations ``over the edge.''\n       The Mount Graham red squirrel, on the federal endangered \n     species list since 1987, has been at the center of a long-\n     running fight between environmentalists and development-\n     minded Arizonans. Forest fires and rising temperatures have \n     worsened the animals' plight as they depend on Douglas firs \n     at the top of a 10,720-foot mountain for food and nest-\n     building materials. The population has dipped from about 562 \n     animals in spring 1999 to 264 last fall.\n       ``They are so on the downhill slide,'' said Thetis Gamberg, \n     a U.S. Fish and Wildlife biologist who has an image of the \n     endangered squirrel on her business card. Atop Mount Graham, \n     the squirrels' predicament is readily visible. Mixed conifers \n     are replacing Douglas firs at higher altitudes, and recent \n     fires have destroyed other parts of the forest, depriving the \n     animals of the cones they need.\n       Environmentalists such as Turner worry about the \n     disappearance of the Mount Graham squirrel, the long-tailed, \n     mouselike vole and native wet meadows known as cienegas, but \n     many lawmakers and state officials are more focused on the \n     practical question of water supply.\n       Reese Woodling, in white, used to own a 2,700-acre ranch, \n     but lack of rain reduced the grassland--his main source of \n     cattle feed.\n       Arizona gets its water from groundwater and rivers such as \n     the massive Colorado, a 1,450-mile waterway that supplies \n     water to seven states: Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, \n     New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming.\n       The recent drought and changing weather patterns have \n     shrunk the western snowpack and drained the region's two \n     biggest reservoirs, lakes Mead and Powell, to half their \n     capacity. More precipitation is falling as rain instead of \n     snow, and it is coming earlier in the year, which leads to \n     rapid runoff that disappears quickly.\n       Scientists at Scripps Institution of Oceanography predict \n     that by 2090 global warming will reduce the Sierra Nevada \n     snowpack, which accounts for half of California's water \n     reserves, by 30 percent to 90 percent. ``It makes water \n     management more challenging,'' said Kathy Jacobs, who spent \n     two decades managing state water resources before joining the \n     University of Arizona's Water Resources Research Center. \n     ``You can either reduce demand or increase supply.''\n       Water managers have just begun to consider climate change \n     in their long-term planning. Forest managers have also \n     started asking for climate briefings, now that scientists \n     have documented that short, wet periods followed by drought \n     lead to the kind of giant forest fires that have been \n     devastating the West.\n       This month, scientists at the National Center for \n     Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., published a study \n     showing that worldwide, regions suffering from serious \n     drought more than doubled in area from the early 1970s to the \n     early 2000s, with much of the change attributed to global \n     warming. A separate recent report in the journal Science \n     concluded that higher temperatures could cause serious long-\n     term drought over western North America.\n       C. Mark Eakin, a paleoclimatologist at the National Oceanic \n     and Atmospheric Administration who co-wrote the study in \n     Science, said historical climate records suggest the current \n     drought could just be the beginning.\n       ``When you've got an increased tendency toward drought in a \n     region that's already stressed, then you're just looking for \n     trouble,'' Eakin said. ``Weather is like rolling the dice, \n     and climate change is like loading the dice.''\n       Still, Arizona politicians remain divided on how to address \n     global warming. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) has led the \n     national fight to impose mandatory limits on industrial \n     carbon dioxide emissions that are linked to warming, though \n     his bill remains stalled.\n       ``We'll win on this issue because the evidence continues to \n     accumulate,'' McCain said in an interview. ``The question is \n     how much damage will be done until we do prevail.''\n       But other Arizona Republicans are resistant. State Sen. \n     Robert Blendu, who opposed a bill last year to establish a \n     climate change study committee, said he wants to make sure \n     politicians ``avoid the public knee-jerk reaction before we \n     get sound science.''\n       That mind-set frustrates ranchers such as Woodling, who is \n     raising 10 grass-fed cows on a leased pasture. At age 69, he \n     will never be able to rebuild his herd, he said, but he \n     believes politicians have an obligation to help restore the \n     environment.\n       ``Man has been a great cause of this, and man needs to \n     address it,'' he said.\n                                  ____\n\n\n   USCAN Rebuttal to Key Points in Senator Inhofe's Floor Statement, \n                            January 4, 2005\n\n       The following individuals contributed to this response: \n     U.S. Delegation at COP10, Debbie Reed, National Environmental \n     Trust; EU Targets: Jeff Fiedler, Natural Resources Defense \n     Council; Scientific Consensus: Brenda Ekwurzel, Julie \n     Anderson Union of Concerned Scientists; and Costs: Ansje \n     Miller, Environmental Justice and Climate Change Initiative.\n       For more information or with any questions, contact: Lee \n     Hayes Byron, U.S. Climate Action Network, \n     Ihbyron@climatenetwork.org, 202-513-6240.\n\n\n                        U.S. Delegation at COP10\n\n       Senator Inhofe's characterization of Under Secretary Paula \n     Dobriansky's rebuff at attempts to ``drag the U.S. into \n     discussions concerning post-Kyoto climate change \n     commitments'' at the recent UNFCCC conference in Buenos Aires \n     is only partially accurate. Ms. Dobriansky did, indeed make \n     clear the fact that the Bush administration believes that \n     post-2012 talks are ``premature.'' Some countries, including \n     the E.U., were indeed hopeful that the U.S., the world's \n     largest emitter of greenhouse gas pollution, would join post-\n     2012 discussions, having previously\n\n[[Page S1266]]\n\n     withdrawn from the Kyoto Protocol, and having proclaimed \n     domestic action to reduce GHG emissions, despite the fact \n     that U.S. emissions continue to increase unabated. Senator \n     Inhofe's material omission from this statement, however, is \n     illustrative of his and the Bush administration's true goals: \n     to prevent the rest of the world from making progress on \n     reducing global GHG emissions. What Senator Inhofe failed to \n     mention in his diatribe was that the Bush administration in \n     Buenos Aires not only demurred from participating in these \n     discussions, but also acted to prevent the rest of the \n     world's countries from beginning those discussions even in \n     the absence of U.S. participation. Without objections from \n     the United States, the post-20l2 discussions could have \n     begun, and would have allowed some ideas and suggestions for \n     the post-20l2 period to be presented to the next meeting of \n     the UNFCCC in November, 2005. But Under Secretary Dobriansky \n     and the Bush administration objected and threw up every \n     possible obstacle to allowing other countries to have those \n     discussions, with or without the U.S. The result is that one \n     multiple-day meeting, with a narrowly defined agenda to \n     discuss post-2012 strategies was agreed to--but the exact \n     nature of the discussions, and the ability of the meeting's \n     participants to report to the UNFCCC in November 2005 was a \n     matter of disagreement even as the agreement was made. It is \n     highly likely that the meeting itself will be contentious, \n     for these reasons. But the real question is why the U.S. \n     insists on blocking the rest of the world from moving on, \n     even if it chooses not to? Senator Inhofe would better serve \n     his constituents and his colleagues to accurately and \n     completely report the Administration's actions at the \n     meeting.\n       Similarly, the Senator reported that there was discussion \n     but no resolution at the meeting on how to address emissions \n     from developing countries. He claimed that developing \n     countries, ``most notably China, remained adamant in Buenos \n     Aires in opposing any mandatory greenhouse gas reductions, \n     now or in the future.'' Again, his material omission is \n     significant. The United States remained adamant in Buenos \n     Aires in opposing any mandatory greenhouse gas reductions, \n     now or in the future. And the United States urged China and \n     India to do the same. The Bush administration's duplicity--\n     claiming that they will not act until China and India do, and \n     then visibly and vocally urging China and India not to act--\n     is unconscionable, as is Senator Inhofe's. And the Senator \n     perhaps should acknowledge the fact that, since the Senate \n     passed the Byrd-Hagel resolution in 1997, it has passed three \n     additional resolutions on climate change--all of which \n     clearly state that climate change is happening and that the \n     United States should take a credible, leadership role in \n     combating global warming--including by re-engaging in the \n     international climate change negotiations. Paula Dobriansky, \n     when asked whether the Bush administration knew of these \n     resolutions, and if so, whether they intended to comply, said \n     ``yes,'' they were fully aware of resolutions, but ``no'', \n     they had no intention of complying. If that is the case, so \n     be it--but let's be honest and open about it, Senator Inhofe.\n\n\n                               EU Targets\n\n       In contrast to Senator Inhofe's contention that ``most EU \n     member states will not meet their Kyoto targets and have no \n     real intentions of doing so,'' a recent analysis by the \n     European Environment Agency (EEA) concluded that the EU is in \n     fact on track to meet its Kyoto targets. This analysis \n     examined existing and planned policies, as well as the use of \n     the Kyoto emissions trading measures.\n       Looking only at policies that were being implemented at the \n     time of the analysis, EEA projected that the EU would indeed \n     fall short of its targets (with emissions 1% below 1990 \n     instead of 8%). However, looking at planned policies, the EU \n     is on track to exceed its -8% target. Domestic EU policies \n     alone are projected to achieve a 7.7% reduction. The small \n     remaining gap is covered by international emission reduction \n     projects for which funds have already been budgeted.\n       The effect of ``planned policies'' cannot be dismissed as \n     wishful thinking. Included in the list of ``planned \n     policies'' is the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, a mandatory \n     cap-and-trade policy for large stationary sources, which \n     started operation this year. Many other EU-wide policies have \n     been adopted by the EU Council and Parliament, and are now \n     being incorporated into law by EU member states. These \n     policies include measures to promote renewable electricity \n     production, increase building efficiency, and restructure \n     energy taxes. A complete list of future policies that are in \n     advanced stages is available in EEA 2004, at page 21.\n       The EEA projections cited above exclude two additional \n     means of meeting the targets. First, activities in the forest \n     and agriculture sectors are projected to contribute an \n     additional 0.7% emission reduction. Second, the EU can make \n     up any shortfall in existing and planned policies by using \n     the Kyoto Protocol's International Emissions Trading system, \n     ironically an element of the protocol designed by the US. \n     Under this system EU countries will be able to purchase \n     emissions allowances from other Kyoto countries. This \n     includes Russia, which by most projections will have \n     significant excess allowances. Therefore, although it is \n     environmentally preferable for the EU to meet its Kyoto \n     targets solely through domestic policies, it is almost \n     inconceivable that the EU would not be able to achieve \n     compliance through the purchase of Russian allowances.\n\n\n                              Hockey Stick\n\n       Senator Inhofe made the following statements regarding \n     research that reconstructs northern hemisphere temperature \n     over the past millennium. ``The conclusion inferred from the \n     hockey stick is that industrialization, which spawned \n     widespread use of fossil fuels, is causing the planet to \n     warm. I spent considerable time examining this work in my \n     2003 speech. Because Mann effectively erased the well-known \n     phenomena of the Medieval Warming Period--when, by the way, \n     it was warmer than it is today--and the Little Ice Age, I \n     didn't find it very credible. I find it even less credible \n     now.'' Senator Inhofe went on to state, ``In other words, in \n     obliterating the Medieval Warming Period and the Little Ice \n     Age, Mann's hockey stick just doesn't pass muster.''\n       Recent warming trends are confirmed by many independent and \n     reinforcing . indicators. Direct temperature measurements \n     from the past 140 years, combined with past temperature \n     measurements inferred from tree rings, ice cores, and annual \n     sediment layers, show that average northern hemisphere \n     temperatures in the late 20th century are higher than they \n     have been in the last 1,000 years. More recent publications \n     push the temperature reconstruction back to 1,800 years. \n     Indeed, the last 10 years (1995-2004), excluding 1996, are \n     the warmest in the instrumental record from 1861 to the \n     present. This unprecedented recent warming trend is one of \n     many pieces of evidence that ties global warming to human-\n     caused emissions of heat-trapping gases from land-use change \n     and fossil fuel burning.\n       Heat-trapping gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2) \n     absorb energy emitted from the earth's surface and radiate it \n     back downward to warm the lower atmosphere and the surface. \n     The general correlation between temperature and atmospheric \n     CO2 concentration is apparent in ice core records \n     at many locations at the poles and in the temperate and \n     tropical regions throughout the world. The Antarctic ice core \n     records vividly illustrate that current atmospheric carbon \n     dioxide levels are unmatched during the past 420,000 years. \n     Furthermore, CO2 concentration has risen a \n     dramatic 30 percent in the last 150 years. When scientists \n     compare the timing of the recent rise in atmospheric carbon \n     dioxide concentrations with the magnitude of other factors \n     that influence climate--solar variation, volcanic eruptions, \n     and pollutant emissions such as sulfur dioxide--the link \n     between recent warming and human activities is \n     unmistakable.\n       (2) Debate over the ``hockey stick'' temperature \n     reconstruction is largely irrelevant to our current policy \n     choices. The shape of the sharp rise in northern hemisphere \n     average temperature, at the end of the last millennium, led \n     to the common practice of referring to the plot as the \n     ``hockey stick'' figure. Projections of future climate \n     changes, however, are based on the well-known physics linking \n     increasing heat-trapping gas concentrations to conditions at \n     the earth's surface, and these projections do not depend on \n     details of the earth's temperature hundreds of years ago. \n     Thus, debate over the ``hockey stick'' temperature \n     reconstruction is largely irrelevant to our current policy \n     choices. Nevertheless, because the scientific debate on this \n     issue has been misinterpreted, most recently in Senator \n     Inhofe's January 4, 2005 speech, it is worth clarifying a few \n     points.\n       The hockey stick analysis is one of many independent \n     reinforcing indicators of the recent warming. For example, \n     glacier melting is increasing, sea level is rising, and many \n     species' ranges are shifting.\n       The hockey stick reconstruction represents the average \n     temperature across the entire northern hemisphere--an average \n     of many measurements taken from locations north of the \n     equator. This averaging is important because local \n     temperatures can vary considerably for many climatological \n     reasons, and so a hemispheric average gives a truer picture \n     of a warming climate. Therefore, looking at regional data in \n     isolation, such as temperatures from the ``Medieval Warm \n     Period'' in the North Atlantic area, and to therefore claim \n     that the hockey stick temperature reconstruction is invalid, \n     is inaccurate.\n     Additional Remarks\n       In criticizing the ``hockey stick'' temperature record, \n     Senator Inhofe charges that the Mann analysis has been \n     criticized in the pages of Geophysical Research Letters \n     (GRL), a respected, peer-reviewed journal, as ``just bad \n     science.'' This quote does actually appear in GRL in a \n     commentary by Chapman et al. (2004), but Inhofe's citation is \n     quite misleading.\n       The criticism leveled by Chapman et al did not apply to the \n     ``hockey stick''-that is, the 1OOO-year temperature \n     reconstruction by Mann and others. Rather, the Chapman et al. \n     criticism was leveled at a totally different, much more \n     narrow and technical modeling study by Mann and Schmidt in \n     2003 about borehole reconstructions.\n\n\n                                 Arctic\n\n       Senator Inhofe asserted, using the words of Dr. George \n     Taylor from Oregon, that the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment \n     ``appears to be guilty of selective use of data. Many of the \n     trends described in the document begin in the 1960s or 1970s. \n     . . . Yet data are readily available for the 1930s and early \n     1940s, when temperatures were comparable to (and probably \n     higher than) those observed today.''\n\n[[Page S1267]]\n\n       (1) Temperature trends and sea ice trends shown in the \n     Arctic report are century long trends, from 1900-2000. \n     Therefore, Senator Inhofe's attack on the scientific \n     integrity of the Arctic impact assessment is inappropriate.\n       (2) Arctic researchers concluded that the recent warming, \n     in contrast to the earlier warming during the 1930s and \n     1940s, is in response to human activities. No one disputes \n     that Arctic temperatures were almost as high in the 1930s and \n     1940s as they are now, least of all the scientists involved \n     in the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment. The conclusion that \n     the Arctic is now experiencing a stronger, longer, and more \n     widespread warming trend is based on a robust combination of \n     temperature measurements, sea ice retreat, glacial melting, \n     and increasing permafrost temperatures. For example, the \n     century-long sea ice record clearly shows a strong retreat in \n     sea ice extent in recent decades, whereas no such trend is \n     evident during the earlier warm period.\n       Scientists have employed observations and models to analyze \n     these two pronounced twentieth-century warming events, both \n     amplified in the Arctic, and found that the earlier warming \n     was due to natural internal climate-system variability and \n     was not as widespread as today's, whereas the recent warming \n     is in response to human activities.\n       Furthermore, earlier periods of warming either this century \n     or in past centuries do not preclude a human influence on the \n     current warming trend. By way of analogy, just because \n     wildfires are often caused by lightning does not mean that \n     they cannot also be caused by a careless camper. The same can \n     be said for carbon dioxide--just because it has natural \n     sources does not mean that humans do not also contribute to \n     atmospheric carbon dioxide levels and thereby contribute to \n     the resulting warming.\n\n\n                             Sea Level Rise\n\n     Sea level talking points\n       Senator Inhofe stated: ``But in a study published this year \n     in Global and Planetary Change, Dr. Nils-Axel Morner of \n     Sweden found that sea level rise hysteria is overblown. In \n     his study, which relied not only on observational records, \n     but also on satellites, he concluded: `There is a total \n     absence of any recent `acceleration in sea level rise' as \n     often claimed by IPCC and related groups.' Yet we still hear \n     of a future world overwhelmed by floods due to global \n     warming. Such claims are completely out of touch with \n     science. As Sweden's Morner puts it, `there is no fear of \n     massive future flooding as claimed in most global warming \n     scenarios.' ''\n       (1) Research and observation has solidly established that \n     sea level is rising. Our longest historical records come from \n     tide gauge measurements taken along the world's coastlines. \n     These measurements indicate that the globally averaged \n     coastal sea level rose at a rate of about 3.5 inches over 50 \n     years (or 0.7 inch per decade since 1950). Since 1993, \n     satellites have continuously measured sea level over the \n     entire ocean, not just along the shoreline as do tide gauges. \n     Satellite measurements can monitor global sea level with a \n     greater accuracy, and they record a higher global sea-level \n     rise rate of about 1 inch per decade. Given the short record \n     of these satellite measurements, scientists cannot yet \n     conclude if the last decade was unusually high or if it \n     represents an acceleration of sea level rise.\n       (2) Global sea-level rise is primarily the result of \n     expansion of seawater as it warms plus meltwater from land-\n     based ice sheets and land-based mountain glaciers. Many \n     factors contribute to sea level rise, and scientific efforts \n     continue to refine our understanding of the relative \n     contribution of each to the observed sea-level rise. As the \n     climate warms, we expect to see two different effects in the \n     ocean. First, sea level rises as the ocean temperature \n     increases. Just as a gas expands when it is heated, water \n     also expands as its temperature rises. Second, the amount of \n     water entering the ocean increases as land-based ice sheets \n     and glaciers melt. Increased meltwater adds more freshwater \n     to the ocean and increases sea level, just like adding water \n     to a bathtub. This influx of freshwater also lowers the \n     oceans' salinity. Recent research suggests that all \n     continental sources added the equivalent of about 2.7 inches \n     of fresh water over 50 years to the ocean.\n       (3) Rising sea levels increase the impacts from coastal \n     hazards. Because of the steadily rising seas we can expect \n     increased damage to coastal communities around the world. \n     Sea-level rise increases coastal erosion, further inundates \n     coastal wetlands, increases the salinity in estuaries and \n     pushes saltwater further landward in coastal rivers, \n     contaminates coastal freshwater aquifers with saltwater, and \n     increases the risks from flooding. Coastal storms of the same \n     intensity as in the past will create greater damage in the \n     future simply because the baseline sea level is higher. \n     Low-lying coastlands such as Louisiana, Florida, \n     Bangladesh, and the Maldives will be impacted most \n     acutely.\n\n                                 costs\n\n       Senator Inhofe claimed that Kyoto-like policies harm \n     Americans, especially the poor and minorities. This statement \n     is a false scare tactic directed at our most vulnerable \n     communities. The well-documented truth is that not taking \n     action to slow global warning harms Americans, especially the \n     poor and minorities.\n       Global warming is already hurting Americans, especially the \n     poor, its Indigenous Peoples, and people of color, and is \n     projected to get worse if we don't act now.\n       People of color communities--already burdened with poor air \n     quality and twice as likely to be uninsured as whites will \n     become even more vulnerable to climate change related \n     respiratory ailments, heat-related illness and death, and \n     illness from insect-carried diseases.\n       Scientists have determined that the ice in Alaska and the \n     Arctic region is melting so rapidly that much of it could be \n     gone by the end of the century. The results could be \n     catastrophic for polar-region Indigenous peoples and animals, \n     while low-lying lands as far away as Florida could be \n     inundated by rising sea levels.\n       ``We found that scientific observations and those of \n     Indigenous people over many generations are meshing . . . Sea \n     ice is retreating, glaciers are reducing in size, permafrost \n     is thawing, all [these indicators] provide strong evidence \n     that it has been warming rapidly in the Arctic in recent \n     decades.''--Susan Joy Hassol, global warming analyst and \n     author of the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment (ACIA) \n     synthesis report Impacts of a Warming Arctic.\n       Flooding and erosion affects 184 out of 213, or 86 percent, \n     of Alaska Native Villages to some extent. While many of the \n     problems are long-standing, various studies indicate that \n     coastal villages are becoming more susceptible to flooding \n     and erosion caused in part by rising temperatures. Four \n     villages--Kivalina, Koyukuk, Newtok, and Shismaref--are \n     in imminent danger and are planning to relocate. Costs for \n     relocation could be high--from $100-$400 million per \n     village.\n       ``Everything is under threat. Our homes are threatened by \n     storms and melting permafrost, our livelihoods are threatened \n     by changes to the plants and animals we harvest. Even our \n     lives are threatened, as traditional travel routes become \n     dangerous.''--Alaska Chickaloon Village Chief Gary Harrison \n     of the Arctic Athabaskan Council\n       A recent study in Los Angeles found that if we don't act \n     now to slow global warming, L.A. residents will face \n     significant heat-related mortality increases. Under a high \n     emissions scenario, heat-related mortality rates could \n     increase sixteen-fold for Blacks, fourteen-fold for Asians, \n     twelve-fold for Hispanics, and eight-fold for Whites, by \n     2090.\n       Climate change will likely raise food and energy prices, \n     which already represent a large proportion of a low-income \n     family's budget. Integrated Assessment models indicate that \n     the annual cost of gradual climate change with no adaptation \n     may be as high as 1.0 to 1.5 percent of GDP (roughly $80 to \n     $120 billion per year). People of color and the poor may be \n     disproportionately impacted by these changes, due to the \n     higher fraction of incomes spent on food and energy.\n       ``We are long past the point where global warming is \n     considered a myth. We are seeing its effects all around us--\n     especially in my hometown of New Orleans, Louisiana, which is \n     expected to experience an increased incidence of flooding \n     that could potentially destabilize its economy and endangers \n     its populace. We must be realistic about longterm solutions \n     to global warming.''--Rep. William Jefferson, (D-LA)\n       ``African Americans and other vulnerable populations live \n     disproportionately in areas that are exposed to toxic waste, \n     air pollution and other environmental hazards. Now we learn, \n     through this report, that global warming will expose these \n     communities to further environmental hazards that will \n     continue to have a devastating impact on their health and \n     economic conditions. We must involve all of the various \n     stakeholders and continue to use forward-thinking, \n     comprehensive principals when developing transportation, \n     energy and environmental policies because of their enormous \n     effect on vulnerable populations.''--Rep. James E. Clyburn, \n     (D-TX)\n       Taking action to slow global warming protects low-income, \n     people of color, and Indigenous communities, and is good for \n     all Americans by boosting job growth, saving money for \n     consumers, and strengthening national security.\n       Studies have found that the benefits of reducing carbon \n     emissions, such as lower air pollution, new jobs, and reduced \n     oil imports, would prove helpful to all Americans. The best \n     policies for the health of people of color and the poor \n     involve a substantial decrease in emissions of carbon dioxide \n     and associated pollutants, and encourage international \n     cooperation in mitigating climate change.\n       Policies to reduce global warming can boost job growth, \n     save money for consumers, and strengthen national security \n     (Hoerner and Barrett). How America benefits:\n       1.4 million additional new jobs created;\n       Average household saving on energy bills of $1,275 per \n     year; and\n       Reduced dependence on foreign oil, strengthening national \n     and economic security for all Americans.\n       ``It is a travesty that we live in a country where African \n     Americans expend more of their income on energy costs yet are \n     the most negatively impacted by energy byproducts such as \n     carbon emissions. In the current scenario, African Americans \n     are paying a premium for poor health resulting from air \n     pollution and climate change. We must mobilize and energize \n     our policymakers to enact legislation that will mitigate the \n     unjust effects of global warming.''--Rev. Jesse L. Jackson, \n     Sr., Rainbow Push Coalition\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S1268]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am honored to rise with my friend and \ncolleague from Arizona, Senator McCain, to introduce the Climate \nStewardship Act. It is an urgent matter. I was thinking of one clause \nthat I could remove from Senator McCain's comments. He said: Suppose \nSenator Lieberman and I are deluded.\n  It struck me that probably many times in the battles that we have \nfought together or individually, people have thought we were deluded. \nIf I was going to be deluded, I would rather be deluded in the company \nof John McCain than anybody else I can think of. But let me say this: \nWe are not deluded in our battle to get the U.S. Government to assume a \nleadership role in stopping this planet of ours from warming, with \ndisastrous consequences for the way we and certainly our children and \ngrandchildren will be forced to live if we do not do something.\n  When Senator McCain and I first started to work with people in the \nfield, the scientists, the businesspeople, the environmentalists, we \nhad a pretty clear picture of what was coming, but very often we had to \nrely on scientific models and assume their accuracy in terms of the \nworst consequences. That is over.\n  As Senator McCain's charts and pictures show, we can see with our \neyes the effects of global warming already. The planet is warming. The \npolar ice caps are melting. One can see that with their own eyes. The \nsea level is rising in coastal areas already, and in other areas the \nwater is diminishing, declining, as in the great State of my cosponsor, \nArizona, and the State of the distinguished occupant of the Chair, \nNevada. Forest fires are increasing. The evidence is clear that the \nproblem is here, and that is why we have to do something about it.\n  Doing nothing is no longer an option. We have reached a point where \nthe intractable must yield to the inevitable. The evidence that climate \nchange is real and dangerous keeps pouring in and piling up. What this \nlegislation is all about is pushing, cajoling, and convincing the \npolitics to catch up with the science.\n  I will give real market-based evidence to back up what Senator McCain \nand I are saying about how compelling the science is. The leading \ninsurance companies in the world--we are not talking about \nenvironmentalists--are now predicting that climate-driven disasters \nwill cost global financial centers an additional $150 billion a year \nwithin the next 10 years. That is $150 billion of additional costs for \nthe world as a result of climate-driven disasters.\n  Just a couple of weeks ago, at an international conference, the head \nof the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Dr. R. \nK. Pachauri, said that we are already at ``a dangerous point'' when it \ncomes to global warming, and ``immediate and very deep cuts in \ngreenhouse gases are needed if humanity is to survive.'' Let me repeat \nthose last words: ``If humanity is to survive.''\n  It should be noted that Dr. Pachauri is no wild-eyed environmental \nradical. In fact, the administration lobbied heavily for Dr. Pachauri's \nappointment to the IPCC leadership because it considered him a more \ncautious and pragmatic scientist than the other leading candidate.\n  To call global warming simply an environmental challenge is almost to \ndiminish it or demean it with a kind of simplicity that puts it \nalongside a host of other environmental challenges that we face. Global \nwarming is both a moral and an economic security challenge, as well as \nan environmental challenge.\n\n  I start with what I mean by calling it a moral challenge. Greenhouse \ngases stay in the atmosphere for about 100 years, so failure to take \nthe prudent actions that our bill calls for--market-based, moderate, \nwith caps--will force children still unborn to take far more drastic \naction to save their world as they know it and want to live in it. \nThere is just no excuse for this.\n  We know it is real. I cited the melting glaciers, the coastal \ncommunities damage, the increased rate of forest fires. Previously, on \nthis floor I have talked about the fact that a robin appeared in the \nnorth of Alaska and Canada among the Inuits native tribe, and they had \nno word in their 10,000-year-old civilization and vocabulary for robin.\n  Robins now linger longer into the winter in Connecticut, my State. \nWhy? Because it is getting warmer.\n  Polar bears may soon be listed as an endangered species. Let me put \nit another way. We know that a petition will be filed soon to ask that \npolar bears be listed as an endangered species. Why? Because global \nwarming is removing their habitat. It is wreaking havoc in the arctic \nclimates where they live and grow. So to spoil the Earth for \ngenerations to come when we knew what we were doing and could have \nstopped it would be a moral failing of enormous and, I might add, \nBiblical proportions.\n  This time, it would be mankind that condemned itself, if I may put it \nagain this way, to no longer living in the garden.\n  The challenge of solving global warming also presents our Nation with \nuntold opportunities to reshape our world and assert our moral, \neconomic, and environmental leadership. There is always opportunity in \nchange. The world will transition to a world with limited greenhouse \ngas emissions, and the United States needs a program like the one we \noffer today to seize the new markets, as well as the environmental \nchallenge.\n  In particular, Senator McCain and I are seeking now to develop \nadditional provisions to this legislation that will provide American \ninnovators and businesspeople with the technological incentives they \nneed to make our bill work for them.\n  Looking at the recommendations of the International Climate Change \nTask Force, the National Commission on Energy Policy, and the Pew \nCenter Workshop on Technologies and Policies for a Low Carbon Future, \nthere are a number of consensus provisions that could help the U.S. \ntransition to these technologies of the future.\n  These technologies are here. A recent paper in Science magazine \nshowed that the scientific, technological, and industrial know-how \nalready exists to limit carbon dioxide emissions substantially in the \nnext 50 years. So we do not have to invent them. We just need the \nincentives and the motivation for industry, innovators, and individuals \nto deploy this knowledge and start us on the path toward a healthier, \nmore sustainable future.\n  That is what the Climate Stewardship Act that Senator McCain and I \nare introducing today will do. It will provide the incentives. It will \ncreate a cap and let the market do the rest of the work, a real \nopportunity for change.\n\n  I am very pleased that one study being released today by the NRDC \napplying a method of evaluating which is advocated by the Energy \nInformation Administration of our own Government says the Climate \nStewardship Act will add 800,000 jobs to our economy by the year 2025. \nSo it will not cost jobs, it will add them.\n  Over the last few years, we have seen our colleagues grappling with \nthe challenge of global warming. So many of them seem to be of the same \nmind, feeling that something needs to be done but still unsure what \nshould be done and how. Senator McCain and I want our legislation to \nwork for them so they can come forward and join us in this effort. This \nis an opportunity to invest in our future to face this challenge, an \nopportunity to enhance our energy security, and therefore our national \nsecurity, by placing a price on greenhouse gas emissions, which is what \nour legislation will do.\n  Our Nation's best energy options will become more cost competitive \nwith foreign oil. It will make economic sense for dramatic growth in \nclean coal, alternative energy, and energy efficiency. It will be an \nopportunity for economic development in rural communities. By placing a \nprice on carbon, it will create new value for range lands, farms, and \nforests by compensating landowners for the carbon they can store. It is \nan opportunity to innovate clean energy technologies for a growing \nglobal market. By placing this price that the cap and market will do on \ngreenhouse gases, we will push demand for clean technologies, promoting \ninnovation through both public and private enterprise and making that \ninnovation profitable. It is an opportunity for our country to control \nthe development of our own carbon market that will inevitably become \npart of a\n\n[[Page S1269]]\n\nglobal market someday soon. It is an opportunity, as Senator McCain \nsaid, to improve our relations with our allies and the rest of the \nworld and gain a stronger voice and ability to bring in developing \nnations.\n  Without a price for carbon, these opportunities disappear. Our bill \nprovides that price for carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions. We \nknow it is not the entire answer. A lot of people think it is too \nmoderate and holds greenhouse gas emissions at today's levels.\n  By the end of the decade, it is less demanding than the Kyoto \nProtocol, which goes into effect as a result of Russia's ratification \nnext week, but it is a cap that major utilities have told us they could \nmeet. It may not be strong enough to reduce U.S. emissions as much as \nsome would like, but it will be strong enough to start turning America \naround in the direction of dealing with global warming, reasserting our \nworld environmental leadership, and moving our economy in the right \ndirection. We cannot afford to be as shortsighted as we have been up \nuntil now. We cannot afford anymore to allow the special interests, who \nwill also resist change because change is unnerving and sometimes more \ncostly, to prevail.\n  We have to assert the public interest of ourselves and all those who \nwill follow us on this Earth and in this great country to do something \nabout global warming while we still can, before its consequences are \ndisastrous. This is an enormous political challenge.\n  I go back to where I began. When we started, we had just models, so \nwe were trying to portray what might happen over the horizon and ask \nour colleagues to join us in doing something now. It is not easy to do \nthat because the crisis always seems further away than the immediacy of \nthe changes a solution requires, but now we can see it. Shame on us if \nwe do not do something about it.\n  I begin this battle today with Senator McCain and other cosponsors \nwith not only a sense of commitment but a sense of encouragement and \noptimism that people ultimately are too reasonable and responsible to \nignore the facts and do nothing about this looming disaster for \nhumankind.\n  Senator McCain and I begin this battle again, and we are not going to \nstop until it is won.\n  I ask unanimous consent that several articles on climate be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Brookings Institution, Jan. 28, 2005.]\n\n                  Michael Crichton and Global Warming\n\n                         (By David B. Sandalow)\n\n       How do people learn about global warming?\n       That--more than the merits of any scientific argument--is \n     the most interesting question posed by Michael Crichton's \n     State of Fear.\n       The plot of Crichton's 14th novel is notable mainly for its \n     nuttiness--an MIT professor fights a well-funded network of \n     eco-terrorists trying to kill thousands by creating \n     spectacular ``natural'' disasters. But Crichton uses his book \n     as a vehicle for making two substantive arguments. In light \n     of Crichton's high profile and ability to command media \n     attention, these arguments deserve scrutiny.\n       First, Crichton argues, the scientific evidence for global \n     warming is weak. Crichton rejects many of the conclusions \n     reached by the National Academy of Sciences and \n     Intergovernmental Panel Change--for example, he does not \n     believe that global temperature increases in recent decades \n     are most likely the result of human activities. In \n     challenging the scientific consensus, Crichton rehashes \n     points familiar to those who follow such issues. These points \n     are unpersuasive, as explained below.\n       Second, Crichton argues that concern about global warming \n     is best understood as a fad. In particular, he argues that \n     many people concerned about global warming follow a herd \n     mentality, failing critically to examine the data. Crichton \n     is especially harsh in his portrayal of other members of the \n     Hollywood elite, though his critique extends more broadly to \n     the news media, intelligentsia and general public. This \n     argument is more interesting and provocative, though \n     ultimately unpersuasive as well.\n     1. Climate Science\n       Crichton makes several attempts to cast doubt on scientific \n     evidence regarding global warming. First, he highlights the \n     ``urban heat island effect.'' Crichton explains that cities \n     are often warmer than the surrounding countryside and implies \n     that observed temperature increases during the past century \n     are the result of urban growth, not rising greenhouse gas \n     concentrations.\n       This issue has been examined extensively in the peer-\n     reviewed scientific literature and dismissed by the vast \n     majority of earth scientists as an inadequate explanation of \n     observed temperature rise. Ocean temperatures have climbed \n     steadily during the past century, for example--yet this data \n     is not affected by ``urban heat islands.'' Most land glaciers \n     around the world are melting, far away from urban centers. \n     The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, using only \n     peer-reviewed data, concluded that urban heat islands caused \n     ``at most'' 0.05 deg.C of the increase in global average \n     temperatures during the period 1900-1990--roughtly one-tenth \n     of the increase during this period. In contrast, as one \n     source reports, ``there are no known scientific peer-reviewed \n     papers'' to support the view that ``the heat island effect \n     accounts for much or nearly all warming recorded by land-\n     based thermometers.''\n       Second, Crichton argues that global temperatures declines \n     from 1940-1970 disprove, or at least cast doubt on, \n     scientific conclusions with respect to global warming. Since \n     concentrations of greenhouse gases were rising during this \n     period, says Crichton, the fact that global temperatures were \n     falling calls into question the link between greenhouse gas \n     concentrations and temperatures.\n       Crichton is correct that average temperatures declined, at \n     least in the Northern Hemisphere, from 1940-1970. Temperature \n     is the result of many factors, including the warming effects \n     of greenhouse gases, the cooling effects of volcanic \n     eruptions, changes in solar radiation and more. (Think of a \n     game of tug-of-war, in which the number of players on each \n     team changes frequently.) The fall in Northern Hempishere \n     temperatures from 1940-1970 reflects the relative weight of \n     cooling factors during that period, not the absence of a \n     warming effect from man-made greenhouse gases.\n       Should we at least be encouraged, recalling the decades \n     from 1940-1970 in the hope that cooling factors will outweigh \n     greenhouse warming in the decades ahead? Hardly. Greenhouse \n     gas concentrations are now well outside levels previously \n     experienced in human history and climbing sharply. Unless we \n     change course, the relatively minor warming caused by man-\n     made greenhouse gases in the last century will be dwarfed by \n     much greater warming from such gases in the next century. \n     There is no basis for believing that cooling factors such as \n     those that dominated the temperature record from 1940-1970 \n     will be sufficient to counteract greenhouse warming in the \n     decades ahead.\n       Third, Crichton offers graph after graph showing \n     temperature declines during the past century in places such \n     as Puenta Arenas (Chile), Greenville (South Carolina), Ann \n     Arbor (Michigan), Syracuse (New York) and Navacerrada \n     (Spain). But global warming is an increase in global average \n     temperatures. Nothing about specific local temperature \n     declines is inconsistent with the conclusion that the planet \n     as a whole has warmed during the past century, or that it \n     will warm more in the next century if greenhouse gas \n     concentrations continue to climb.\n       Crichton makes other arguments but a point-by-point \n     rebuttal is beyond the scope of this paper. (A thoughtful \n     rebuttal of that kind can be found at www.realclimate.org.) \n     Climate change science is a complex topic, not easily reduced \n     to short summaries. But a useful contrast with Crichton's \n     science-argument-within-an-action-novel is the sober prose of \n     the U.S. National Academy of Sciences. The opening paragraph \n     of a 2001 National Academy report responding to a request \n     from the Bush White House read:\n       ``Greenhouse gases are accumulating in Earth's atmosphere \n     as a result of human activities, causing surface air \n     temperatures and subsurface ocean temperatures to rise. \n     Temperatures are, in fact, rising. The changes observed over \n     the last several decades are likely mostly due to human \n     activities, but we cannot rule out that some significant part \n     of these changes is also a reflection of natural variability. \n     Human-induced warming and associated sea level rises are \n     expected to continue through the 21st century. Secondary \n     effects are suggested by computer model simulations and basic \n     physical reasoning. These include increases in rainfall rates \n     and increased susceptibility of semi-arid regions to drought. \n     The impacts of these changes will be critically dependent on \n     the magnitude of the warming and the rate with which it \n     occurs.''\n       Climate Change Science: An Analysis of Some Key Questions, \n     National Academies Press (2001).\n       Time will tell whether this report or Crichton's novel will \n     have a greater impact on public understanding of global \n     warming.\n     2. Climate Fad\n       This raises the second, more interesting argument in \n     Crichton's novel. Crichton argues that concern about global \n     warming has become a fad embraced by media elites, \n     entertainment moguls, the scientific establishment and \n     general public. In Crichton's view, many assertions are \n     accepted as fact without critical analysis by the vast \n     majority of those who have views on this issue.\n       On the last point, fair enough. There are indeed fewer \n     people who have sorted through the minutiae of climate change \n     science than have opinions on the topic. In this regard, \n     global warming is like Social Security reform, health care \n     finance, the military budget and many other complex public \n     policy issues. As Nelson Polsby and Aaron Wildavsky once \n     wrote, ``Most people don't think about most issues most of \n     the time.'' When forming opinions on such matters, we all \n     apply certain predispositions or instincts\n\n[[Page S1270]]\n\n     and rely on others whose judgment or expertise we trust.\n       Of course this observation applies as well to the economics \n     of climate change. The perception is widespread in many \n     circles that reducing greenhouse gas emissions will be \n     ruinously expensive. How many of those who hold this view \n     have subjected their opinions to critical analysis? Crichton \n     never musters outrage on this topic.\n       Crichton's complaints are particularly striking in light of \n     the highly successful efforts to provide policymakers and the \n     public with analytically rigorous, non-political advice on \n     climate science. Since 1988, the Intergovernmental Panel on \n     Climate Change has convened thousands of scientists, \n     economists, engineers and other experts to review and distill \n     the peer-reviewed literature on the science on global \n     warming. The IPCC has produced three reports and is now at \n     work on the fourth. In addition, the National Academy of \n     Sciences has provided advice to the U.S. government on this \n     topic, including the report cited above.\n       Crichton's view that the American media provides a steady \n     drumbeat of scary news on global warming is especially hard \n     to fathom. Solid data are scarce, but one 1996 analysis found \n     that the rock star Madonna was mentioned roughly 80 times \n     more often than global warming in the Lexis-Nexis database. \n     Certainly one could watch the evening news for weeks on end \n     without ever seeing a global warming story.\n       Furthermore, the print media's ``on the one hand, on the \n     other hand'' convention tilts many global warming stories \n     strongly toward Crichton's point of view. As Crichton would \n     concede, the vast majority of the world's scientists believe \n     that global warming is happening as a result of human \n     activities and that the consequences of rising greenhouse gas \n     emissions could be very serious. Still, many news stories on \n     global warming include not just this mainstream view but also \n     the ``contrarian'' views of a very small minority of climate \n     change skeptics, giving roughly equal weight to each. As a \n     result, public perceptions of the controversy surrounding \n     these issues may be greatly exaggerated.\n       Crichton's most serious charge is that ``open and frank \n     discussion of the data, and of the issues, is being \n     suppressed'' in the scientific community. As ``proof,'' he \n     offers the assertion that many critics of global warming are \n     retired professors no longer seeking grants. Whether there is \n     any basis for these assertions is unclear, but if so Crichton \n     should back up his claims with more than mere assertions in \n     the appendix to an action novel.\n       Indeed Crichton should hold himself to a higher standard \n     with regard to all the arguments in his book. He is plainly a \n     very bright guy and, famously, a Harvard Medical School \n     graduate. A millionaire many times over, he doesn't need to \n     be seeking grants. If he has something serious to say on the \n     science of climate change, he should say so in a work of \n     nonfiction and submit his work for peer review. The result \n     could be instructive--for him and us all.\n                                  ____\n\n\n           Arctic Temperature Change--Over the Past 100 Years\n\n       This note has been prepared in response to questions and \n     comments that have arisen since the publication of the Arctic \n     Climate Impact Assessment overview document--``Impacts of a \n     Warming Arctic''. It is intended to provide clarity regarding \n     some aspects relative to the material from Chapter 2 Arctic \n     Climate--Past and Present that will appear in full with the \n     publication of the ACIA scientific report in 2005 and has now \n     been posted on the ACIA website.\n       There are several possible definitions of the Arctic \n     depending on, for example, tree line, continuous permafrost, \n     and other factors. It was decided for purposes of this \n     analysis that the latitude 60 deg. N would be defined as the \n     southern boundary. Although somewhat arbitrary, this is no \n     more arbitrary than choosing 62 deg. N, 67 deg. N or any \n     other latitude. Since the marine data in the Arctic are very \n     limited in geographical and temporal coverage, it was \n     decided, for consistency, to only use data from land \n     stations. The Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN) \n     database (updated from Peterson and Vose, 1997) and the \n     Climatic Research Unit (CRU) database (Jones and Moberg, \n     2003) were selected for this analysis.\n       The analysis showed that the annual land-surface air \n     temperature variations in the Arctic (north of 60 deg. N) \n     from 1900 to 2002 using the GHCN and the CRU datasets led to \n     virtually identical time series, and both documented a \n     statistically significant warming trend of 0.09 C/decade \n     during that period. In view of the high correlation between \n     the GHCN and CRU datasets, it was decided to focus the \n     presentation in Chapter 2 on analyses of the GHCN dataset.\n       It needs to be stressed that the spatial coverage of the \n     region north of 60 deg. N is quite varied. During the period \n     (1900-1945), there were few observing stations in the Alaska/\n     Canadian Arctic/West Greenland sector and more in the North \n     Atlantic (East Greenland/Iceland/Scandinavia) and Russian \n     sectors. The coverage for periods since 1945 is more uniform. \n     Based on the analyses of the GHCN and CRU datasets, the \n     annual land-surface air temperature from 60-90 deg. N, \n     smoothed with a 21-point binomial filter giving near decadal \n     averages, was warmer in the most recent decade (1990s) than \n     it was in the 1930-1940s period. It should be noted that \n     other analyses (e.g., Przybylak 2000; Polyakov et al. 2002; \n     and Lugina et al. 2004) give comparable estimates of Arctic \n     warming for these two decades that, however, lay wit/hin the \n     error margins of possible accuracy of the zonal \n     mean estimates (Vinnikov et al. 1990; Vinnikov et \n     al.,1987). The major source of this uncertainty is the \n     data deficiency in the North American sector prior to \n     1950s in all databases.\n       Least-squares linear trends in annual anomalies of Arctic \n     (60 deg. to 90 deg. N) land-surface air temperature from the \n     GHCN (updated from Peterson and Vose, 1997) and CRU (Jones \n     and Moberg, 2003) datasets for the period 1966-2003 both gave \n     warming rates of 0.38 ( deg.C/decade). This is consistent \n     with the analysis of Polyakov et al. (2002) and confirmed \n     with satellite observations over the whole Arctic, for the \n     past 2 decades (Comiso, 2003).\n       Chapter 3 of the ACIA report, entitled ``The Changing \n     Arctic: Indigenous Perspectives'' documents the traditional \n     knowledge of Arctic residents and indicates that substantial \n     changes have already occurred in the Arctic and supports the \n     evidence that the most recent decade is different from those \n     of earlier in the 20th century.\n       The modeling studies of Johannessen et al. (2004) showed \n     the importance of anthropogenic forcing over the past half \n     century for modeling the arctic climate. ``It is suggested \n     strongly that whereas the earlier warming was natural \n     internal climate-system variability, the recent SAT (surface \n     air temperature) changes are a response to anthropogenic \n     forcing''.\n       In the context of this report, the authors agreed on the \n     following terminology. A conclusion termed as ``very \n     probable'' is to be interpreted that the authors were 90-99% \n     confident in the conclusion. The term ``probable'' conveys a \n     66-90% confidence.\n       The conclusions of Chapter 2 were that: ``Based on the \n     analysis of the climate of the 20th century, it is very \n     probable that the Arctic has warmed over the past century, \n     although the warming has not been uniform. Land stations \n     north of 60 deg. N indicate that the average surface \n     temperature increased by approximately 0.09  deg.C/decade \n     during the past century, which is greater than the 0.06 \n     deg.C/decade increase averaged over the Northern Hemisphere. \n     It is not possible to be certain of the variation in mean \n     landstation temperature over the first half of the 20th \n     century because of a scarcity of observations across the \n     Arctic before about 1950. However, it is probable that the \n     past decade was warmer than any other in the period of the \n     instrumental record.''\n       Polar amplification refers to the relative rates of warming \n     in the Arctic versus other latitude bands. The conclusions of \n     Chapter 2 were that: ``Evidence of polar amplification \n     depends on the timescale of examination. Over the past 100 \n     years, it is possible that there has been polar \n     amplification, however, over the past 50 years it is probable \n     that polar amplification has occurred.''\n\n\n                               References\n\n       Comiso, J., 2003.

It's not quite clear. \n     Regardless, the message of the book is that global warming is \n     a non-problem. A lesson for our times? Sadly, no.\n       In between car chases, shoot-outs, cannibalistic rites, and \n     other assorted derring-doo-doo, the novel addresses \n     scientific issues, but is selective (and occasionally \n     mistaken) about the basic science involved. Some of the \n     issues Crichton raises are real and already well-appreciated, \n     while others are red herrings used to confuse rather than \n     enlighten.\n       The fictional champion of Crichton's climate skepticism is \n     John Kenner, an MIT academic-turned-undercover operative who \n     runs intellectual rings around two other characters--the \n     actor (a rather dim-witted chap) and the lawyer (a duped \n     innocent), neither of whom know much about science.\n       So, for the benefit of actors and lawyers everywhere, I \n     will try to help out.\n\n\n                            forcings majeure\n\n       Early in State of Fear, a skeptical character points out \n     that while carbon dioxide was rising between 1940 and 1970, \n     the globe was cooling. What, then, makes us so certain rising \n     CO2 is behind recent warming?\n       Good question. Northern-hemisphere mean temperatures do \n     appear to have fallen over that 30-year period, despite a \n     rise in CO2, which if all else had been equal \n     should have led to warming. But were all things equal? \n     Actually, no.\n       In the real world, climate is affected both by internal \n     variability (natural internal processes within the climate \n     system) and forcings (external forces, either natural or \n     human-induced, acting on the climate system). Some forcings--\n     sulfate and nitrate aerosols, land-use changes, solar \n     irradiance, and volcanic aerosols, for instance--can cause \n     cooling.\n       Matching up what really happened with what we might have \n     expected to happen requires taking into consideration all the \n     forcings, as best as we can. Even then, any discrepancy might \n     be due to internal variability (related principally to the \n     ocean on multi-decadal time scales). Our current ``best \n     guess'' is that the global mean changes in temperature, \n     including the 1940-1970 cooling, are quite closely related to \n     the forcings. Regional patterns of change appear to be linked \n     more closely to internal variability, particularly during the \n     1930s.\n       No model that does not include a sharp rise in greenhouse \n     gases (GHGs), principally CO2, is able to match up \n     with recent warming. Thus the conclusion that GHGs are \n     driving warming.\n       The book also shows, through the selective use of weather-\n     station data, a number of single-station records with long-\n     term cooling trends. In particular, characters visit Punta \n     Arenas, at the tip of South America, where the station record \n     posted on the wall shows a long-term cooling trend (though \n     slight warming since the 1970s). ``There's your global \n     warming,'' one of Crichton's good guys declares dismissively.\n       Well, not exactly. Global warming is defined by the global \n     mean surface temperature. No one has or would claim that the \n     whole globe is warming uniformly. Had the characters visited \n     the nearby station of Santa Cruz Aeropuerto, the poster on \n     the wall would have shown a positive trend. Would that have \n     been proof of global warning? No. Only by amalgamating all \n     available records can we have an idea what the regional, \n     hemispheric, or global means are doing. That's way they call \n     it global warming.\n\n\n                         Tall, Dark, and Hansen\n\n       Even more troubling is some misleading commentary regarding \n     climate-science pioneer (and my boss) James Hansen's \n     testimony to Congress in 1988. ``Dr. Hansen overestimated \n     [global warming] by 300 percent,'' says our hero Kenner.\n       Hansen's testimony did indeed spread awareness of global \n     warming, but not because he exaggerated the problem by 300 \n     percent. In a paper published soon after that testimony, \n     Hansen and colleagues presented three model simulations, each \n     following a different scenario for the growth in \n     CO2 and other trace gases and forcings. Scenario A \n     had exponentially increasing CO2, scenario B had a \n     more modest business-as-usual assumption, and scenario C had \n     no further increase in CO2 after the year 2000. \n     Both B and C assumed a large volcanic eruption in 1995.\n       Rightly, the authors did not assume they knew what path \n     CO2 emissions would take, and presented a spectrum \n     of possibilities. The scenario that turned out to be closest \n     to the real path of forcings growth was scenario B, with the \n     difference that Mt. Pinatubo erupted in 1991, not 1995. The \n     temperature change for the '90s predicted under this scenario \n     was very close to the actual 0.11 degree-Celsius change \n     observed.\n       So, given a good estimate of the forcings, the model did a \n     reasonable job. In fact, in his congressional testimony \n     Hansen only showed results from scenario B, and stated \n     clearly that it was the most probable scenario.\n       The claim of a ``300 percent'' error comes from noted \n     climate skeptic Patrick Michaels, who in testimony before \n     Congress in 1998 deleted scenarios B and C from the chart he \n     used in order to give the impression that the models were \n     unreliable. Thus a significant success for climate modeling \n     was presented as a complete failure--a willful distortion \n     that Crichton adopts uncritically.\n       The well-known and exhaustively studied ``urban heat island \n     effect''--the tendency for cities to be warmer than the \n     surrounding countryside due to the built-up surroundings and \n     intensive energy use--is also raised several times in the \n     book. Most recently, a study by David Parker published last \n     year in the journal Nature found no residual effect in the \n     surface temperature record once corrections were made for \n     this undisputed phenomenon. Though Crichton makes much of it, \n     there's no there there.\n\n\n                         Authorial Inattention\n\n       At the end of the book, Crichton offers a somber author's \n     note. In it, he reiterates the main points of his thesis: \n     that there are some who push claims beyond what is \n     scientifically supported in order to drum up support (and I \n     have some sympathy with this), and that because we don't know \n     everything, we actually know nothing (here, I beg to differ).\n       He gives us his back-of-a-napkin estimate for the global \n     warming that will occur over the next century--an increase of \n     approximately 0.8 degrees Celsius--and claims that his guess \n     is as good as any model's. He suggests that most of the \n     warming will be due to land-use changes--extremely unlikely, \n     as globally speaking, land-use change has a cooling effect. \n     As his faulty assumptions painfully demonstrate, simulations \n     based on physics are better than just guessing.\n       Finally, in an appendix, Crichton uses a rather curious \n     train of logic to compare global warming to the 19th century \n     eugenics movement. Eugenics, he notes, was studied in \n     prestigious universities and supported by charitable \n     foundations. Today, global warming is studied in prestigious \n     universities and supported by charitable foundations. Aha!\n       Presumably Crichton doesn't actually believe that \n     foundation-supported academic research is ipso facto \n     misguided, even evil, but that is certainly the impression \n     left by this peculiar linkage.\n       In summary, I am disappointed, not least because while \n     researching his book, Crichton visited our lab at the NASA \n     Goddard Institute and discussed some of these issues with me \n     and a few of my colleagues. I suppose we didn't do a very \n     good job of explaining matters. Judging from his \n     bibliography, the rather dry prose of reports by the \n     Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change did not stir his \n     senses quite like some of the racier contrarian texts. \n     Unsurprisingly, perhaps, Crichton picked fiction over fact.\n       Scientifically curious readers can find a more detailed \n     version of this review on RealClimate.org.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

A bill to provide for qualified withdrawals from the Capital \nConstruction Fund for fishermen leaving the industry and for the \nrollover of Capital Construction Funds to individual retirement plans, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce the Capital \nConstruction Fund Qualified Withdrawal Act of 2005. My friend and \ncolleague, Senator Smith, joins me in introducing this important bill.\n  In January of 2000, a fishery disaster was declared by the Secretary \nof Commerce for the West Coast groundfish fishery. Due to major \ndeclines in fish population, the Pacific Fisheries Management Council \ndecreased groundfish catch quotas by 90 percent. Today, the groundfish \nfishery in Oregon and adjoining States in the Pacific Northwest\n\n[[Page S1272]]\n\ncontinues to face daunting challenges as a result of this disaster. \nFishery income has dropped 55 percent and over a thousand fishers face \nbankruptcy. This legislation helps by reforming the Capital \nConstruction Fund in a way that will ease the transition by \ngroundfishers and other fishers in economic peril away from fishing.\n  The Capital Construction Fund, CCF, Merchant Marine Act of 1936, \namended 1969, 46 U.S.C. 1177, has been a way for fishers to accumulate \nfunds, free from taxes, solely for the purpose of buying or refitting \nfishing vessels. It was conceived at a time when the Federal Government \nwanted to help capitalize and expand American fishing fleets. The \nprogram was a success: it led to a larger U.S. fishing fleet. However, \nfish populations declined and the U.S. commercial fishing fleet is now \nover-capitalized. The CCF's restrictions have not kept up with the \ntimes, and now it exacerbates some problems facing U.S. fisheries.\n  Now is the time to help those fishers who wish to do so to leave the \nfleet.\n  In Oregon, the amounts in CCF accounts range from $10,000 to over \n$200,000. This legislation changes current law to allow fishers to \nremove money from their CCF for purposes other than buying new vessels \nor upgrading current vessels, without losing up to 70 percent of their \nCCF funds in taxes and penalties. This legislation changes the CCF so \nfishers who want to opt out of fishing are not penalized for doing so.\n  This bill takes a significant step towards making the commercial \nfishing industry sustainable by amending the CCF to allow non-fishing \nuses of investments. This bill amends the Merchant Marine Act of 1936 \nand the Internal Revenue Code to allow funds currently in the CCF to be \nrolled over into an IRA or other type of retirement account, or to be \nused for the payment of an industry fee authorized by the fishery \ncapacity reduction program, without adverse tax consequences to the \naccount holders. This bill will also encourage innovation and \nconservation by allowing fishers to use funds deposited in a CCF to \ndevelop or purchase new gear that reduces bycatch.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN:\n  S. 345. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \ndeliver a meaningful benefit and lower prescription drug prices under \nthe medicare program; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would speak for a moment, if I could, on \nan issue which is near and dear to not just seniors but their families.\n  Last night, CMS Administrator Mark McClellan acknowledged the \ncumulative cost of the Medicare prescription drug program between 2006 \nand 2015 will reach $1.2 trillion. Although Mr. McClellan said the \nnumber would be reduced to $724 billion after seniors pay their \npremiums and the Federal Government is reimbursed by States for \ncoverage of their Medicaid populations, it is still much higher than \noriginally thought. As recently as September, Mr. McClellan said this \nprogram would only cost $534 billion.\n  Remember this program? This was President Bush's Medicare \nprescription drug program.\n  Now, we all understand that Medicare did not cover prescription \ndrugs. Seniors need that coverage because drugs are so expensive, and \ndrugs are essential for them to maintain their health and stay \nindependent and strong for a long period of time. But when we got into \nthis debate on the floor of the Senate about creating this program, the \npharmaceutical companies lined the hallways around the Senate with men \nin expensive three-piece suits and Gucci loafers and said: Whatever you \ndo, don't touch the profits of the pharmaceutical companies.\n  Too many Senators on both sides of the aisle decided that the profits \nof the pharmaceutical companies were more important than the cost of \nthe drugs for seniors. So, in the bill we included a provision that \nprohibits Medicare from negotiating with the pharmaceutical companies \nto get lower prices for drugs for seniors.\n  What does it mean? It means every single year the cost of \nprescription drugs under this Medicare program will inflate like the \ncost of prescription drugs for people across the United States.\n  Take a look at the drug price comparisons, just for the years 2005 \nand 2016, on some common drugs listed on this chart--what we \nanticipate, using the Bush Administration's calculations for the rate \nof increase for prescription drugs, will happen to their costs.\n  Look at Norvasc. It will go from $170 to $525 in 2016; Plavix, $230 \nto $710; Prevacid, $120 to $374; and Zocor, $124 to $383.\n  So in this period of time, if you want to know why the prescription \ndrug program's costs are going through the roof, it is because the cost \nof the drugs is going through the roof. Unless and until Medicare can \nnegotiate the price of these drugs, and keep them reasonable for \nseniors, there is no way in the world this program is going to be cost-\neffective. It is interesting to me that when this estimate of cost came \nout, Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, the Republican chairman of \nthe Budget Committee, said $400 billion was the original cost of this \nprogram, and we have to cut the benefits back to hit that cost, instead \nof saying, why don't we find a way to reduce the pharmaceutical company \nprofits so we can keep the drugs seniors across America are buying at \nreasonable prices.\n  Drug prices are going to continue to rise. The price of 26 drugs most \ncommonly used by seniors increased 21.6 percent, on average, over the \nlast 3 years, and they will continue to increase in the future.\n  I have gone through some basic drugs on this chart, but I want to \ntell my friends who are following this debate, this is no surprise. \nThose of us who voted against the bill said exactly this would happen: \nIf you do not contain the cost of drugs, you cannot afford this \nprogram. It will explode in the outyears, and future Members of \nCongress and Presidents will decide to cut back on the benefits under \nthe program rather than face the reality of what we did in passing this \nlegislation.\n  Medicare actuaries estimate the prescription drug benefit premium \nwill increase from $35 a month under the President's plan in 2006 to \n$68 a month in 2015. Deductibles will increase. I think we are at a \npoint where we have to acknowledge the obvious.\n\n  Let me say a word about pharmaceutical companies. We want the \npharmaceutical industry to be strong and profitable because in their \nprofits is the money for research for new drugs. That is essential for \nAmerica's health and the world's health. But what we find now is that \npharmaceutical companies in America are spending more money on \nadvertising than they are on research. You cannot turn on the \ntelevision without finding another ad for another drug. Why? Because \nthey want the consuming public to walk into their doctor's office and \nsay: Doctor, I beg you, give me the little purple pill. And doctors do. \nIt is an expensive pill. It may not be the necessary and required pill, \nbut doctors do it. And if you sell more of those little purple pills, \nthe pharmaceutical companies do quite well.\n  Take a look at the profitability of the Fortune 500 drug companies \nversus the profits of all Fortune 500 companies in the year 2002. When \nyou take a look at the drug companies on these red bars, and the other \ncompanies on the yellow bars, you can see exactly the difference. \nProfits as revenues: 17 percent for drug companies, 3.1 percent for \nother companies. Profits as a percentage of equity: 27.6 percent for \npharmaceutical companies, 10.2 percent for the rest of the Fortune 500 \ncompanies.\n  They are extremely profitable companies. We want them to make \nprofits, but not at the expense of seniors who cannot afford to pay.\n  Mr. President, I want to give my colleague an opportunity to speak \nhere. I would say the most important thing I can tell you today is \nthere is an answer. I am reintroducing a bill today that I believe will \ngo a long way to reducing the cost of prescription drugs. The Medicare \nPrescription Drugs Savings and Choice Act instructs the Secretary of \nHHS to offer a nationwide Medicare-delivered prescription drug benefit \nin addition to the current PDP and PPO plans available in the 10 \nregions. It instructs the Secretary of HHS to set a uniform national \npremium of $35 for the first year, and it instructs the Secretary of \nHHS to negotiate group purchasing agreements on behalf of Medicare \nbeneficiaries.\n\n[[Page S1273]]\n\n  This is the way to lower the costs of drugs. I am honored that my \nproposal, the legislation which I am introducing, has been endorsed by \nthe AFL-CIO, AFSCME, the Alliance for Retired Americans, the American \nFederation of Teachers, the American Public Health Association, the \nAmerican Nurses Association, Campaign for America's Future, Center for \nMedicare Advocacy, Consumers Union, Families USA, and a host of other \ngroups. It is an indication to me that they know, for their membership \nand seniors and Americans in general, this legislation is going to be \nan important step forward.\n  I invite my colleagues to join me in sponsoring this legislation so \nwe can bring the cost of drugs within the reach of senior citizens and \nkeep a prescription drug program that is affordable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I commend my colleague for his leadership \non this issue. As I travel around my State, as he does his, too, the \nNo. 1 issue I hear about from people is the cost of health care today.\n  We had an opportunity when we passed the Medicare prescription drug \nbill to deal with that issue. We did not. He has introduced legislation \ntoday that will focus on that incredibly important issue for our \ncountry. I thank him for his leadership.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 345\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Solid Waste Disposal Act to prohibit the \nimportation of Canadian municipal solid waste without State consent; to \nthe Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce the Canadian \nWaste Import Ban Act of 2005, to address the rapidly growing problem of \nCanadian waste shipments to Michigan. Michigan has been known for its \nbeautiful waters, lush forests, and now unfortunately as a top importer \nof international trash.\n  My colleagues may be surprised to learn that the biggest source of \nwaste to Michigan is not from another State, but from our neighbor to \nthe north, Canada. The rapid increase in waste shipments is stunning. \nIn 2003, 180 trash trucks crossed the Ambassador and Blue Water bridges \ninto Michigan. Today, that number has more than doubled to 415 trucks \nper day. You can see these trucks lined up for miles waiting to cross \ninto Michigan, polluting the air and creating traffic congestions. The \ncity of Toronto alone sends over 1 million tons of trash annually to \nMichigan.\n  This waste dramatically decreases Michigan's own landfill capacity, \nand has an incredible negative impact on Michigan's environment and the \npublic health of its citizens. The waste also poses a tremendous \nhomeland security threat, as trucks loaded with garbage are harder for \nCustoms agents to inspect than traditional cargo.\n  I fought and was successful in the installation of radiation \nequipment at these crossings. As a result of this equipment, the Blue \nWater Bridge port director reports that three to four Canadian trash \ntrucks per week are being turned back at the border for containing \ndangerous radioactive materials such as medical waste. But we need the \ntrash shipments to stop completely.\n  Michigan already has protections contained in an international \nagreement between the United States and Canada, but are being ignored. \nUnder the Agreement Concerning the Transboundary Movement of Hazardous \nWaste, which was entered into in 1986, shipments of waste across the \nCanadian-U.S. border require government-to-government notification. The\n\n[[Page S1274]]\n\nEnvironmental Protection Agency, EPA, as the designate authority for \nthe United States would receive the notification and then would have 30 \ndays to consent or object to the shipment. Not only have these \nnotification provisions not been enforced, but the EPA has indicated \nthat they would not object to the municipal waste shipments.\n  Michigan citizens have spoken loud and clear on this issue. More than \n165,000 people signed my on-line petition urging the EPA to use their \npower to stop the Canadian trash shipments. Residents from all 83 \nMichigan counties have signed the petition--an unprecedented response. \nI've presented these signatures to both former EPA Administrator Mike \nLeavitt and Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge. But despite these \nefforts, EPA has not stopped these trash shipments.\n  That is why I'm reintroducing my bill today. The Canadian Waste \nImport Ban of 2005 would stop the Canadian trash shipments by placing \nan immediate Federal ban on the importation of Canadian municipal solid \nwaste. Any State that wishes to receive Canadian trash can opt out of \nthe ban by giving notice to the EPA. The ban will be in place until the \nEPA enforces the notice and consent provision contained in the \nbinational agreement.\n  This legislation would also give Michigan residents the protection \nthey deserve from these shipments. In enforcing the agreement, the EPA \nwould have to obtain the consent of the receiving State before \nconsenting to a Canadian municipal solid waste shipment. So if the \nState of Michigan says no, the EPA must object to the trash shipment.\n  The EPA would also have to consider the impact of the shipment on \nhomeland security, environment, and public health. These waste \nshipments should no longer be accepted without an examination of how it \nwill affect the health and safety of Michigan families.\n  Michigan residents deserve the protections provided by this \ninternational agreement and should be provided the ability to stop \nthese dangerous and unhealthy trash shipments.

A bill to amend titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security \nAct and title III of the Public Health Service Act to improve access to \ninformation about individuals' health care operations and legal rights \nfor care near the end of life, to promote advance care planning and \ndecisionmaking so that individuals' wishes are known should they become \nunable to speak for themselves, to engage health care providers in \ndisseminating information about and assisting in the preparation of \nadvance directives, which include living wills and durable powers of \nattorney for health care, and for other\n\n[[Page S1275]]\n\npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by my \ncolleagues and cosponsors Senators Jay Rockefeller and Richard Lugar as \nwe introduce the Advance Directives Improvement and Education Act of \n2005. Senators Rockefeller and Collins, along with Senator Wyden, \nsponsored legislation with similar goals in the past and have provided \ninvaluable support and counsel in drafting the bill we introduce today.\n  The Advance Directives Improvement and Education Act of 2005 has a \nsimple purpose: to encourage all adults in America, especially those 65 \nand older, to think about, talk about and write down their wishes for \nmedical care near the end of life should they become unable to make \ndecisions for themselves. Advance directives, which include a living \nwill stating the individual's preferences for care, and a power of \nattorney for health care, are critical documents that each of us should \nhave. The goal is clear, but reaching it requires that we educate the \npublic about the importance of advance directives, offer opportunities \nfor discussion of the issues, and reinforce the requirement that health \ncare providers honor patients' wishes. This bill is designed to do just \nthat.\n  Americans are afraid of death. We don't like to think about it, talk \nabout it, or plan for it. And yet, we will all face it. Not only our \nown deaths, but our parents, siblings, friends, and sometimes, \ntragically, children. Today, most Americans face death unprepared. \nFamily members frequently end up making critical medical decisions for \nincapacitated patients, yet they, too, are unprepared. Only 15-20 \npercent of adults have advance directives. Among this group, many have \nnot discussed the contents of these important documents with their \nfamilies or even the person named as the health care proxy.\n  It is time to bring this discussion into the mainstream. Too much is \nat stake to continue to deny our mortality. You all know about the \ntragic situation going on in Florida with Terri Schiavo. Here is a \nyoung woman in a persistent vegetative state who is the subject of a \ndebate about her treatment between her husband and her parents, a \ndebate that has been a court case and a legislative quagmire. Why? \nBecause she didn't write down what type of care she would want in the \nevent an accident, illness or other medical condition caused her to be \nin an incapacitated state. She is young and didn't think about death or \ndying. If she had an advance directive that made her wishes clear and \nnamed a health care proxy to make decisions for her should she be \nunable to do so for herself, the treatment debate might continue, but \nthere would be no question as to who could decide. The Supreme Court \nhas clearly affirmed that competent adults have the right to refuse \nunwanted medical treatment, Washington v. Glucksburg and Vacco v. \nQuill, 1997, but it also stressed that advance directives are a means \nof safeguarding that right should adults become incapable of deciding \nfor themselves.\n  Fortunately, situations like Ms. Schiavo's are rare. Of the 2.5 \nmillion people who die each year 83 percent are Medicare beneficiaries. \nIn fact, 27 percent of Medicare expenditures cover care in the last \nyear of life. Remember, everyone who enrolls in Medicare will die on \nMedicare. The Advance Directives Improvement and Education Act \nencourages all Medicare beneficiaries to prepare advance directives by \nproviding a free physician office visit for the purpose of discussing \nend-of-life care choices and other issues around medical decision-\nmaking in a time of incapacitation. Physicians will be reimbursed for \nspending time with their patients to help them understand situations in \nwhich an advance directive would be useful, medical options, the \nMedicare hospice benefit and other concerns. The conversation will also \nenable physicians to learn about their patients' wishes, fears, \nreligious beliefs, and life experiences that might influence their \nmedical care wishes. These are important aspects of a physician-patient \nrelationship that are too often unaddressed.\n  Another part of our bill will provide funds for the Department of \nHealth and Human Services to conduct a public education campaign to \nraise awareness of the importance of planning for care near the end of \nlife. This campaign would explain what advance directives are, where \nthey are available, what questions need to be asked and answered, and \nwhat to do with the executed documents. HHS, directly or through \ngrants, would also establish an information clearinghouse where \nconsumers could receive state-specific information and consumer-\nfriendly documents and publications.\n  State-specific information is needed because in addition to the \nfederal Patients Self Determination Act passed in 1990, most states \nalso have enacted advance directive laws. Because the state laws \ndiffer, some states may be reluctant to honor advance directives that \nwere executed in another state. The bill we introduce today contains \nlanguage that would make all advance directives ``portable,'' that is, \nuseful from one state to another. As long as the documents were \nlawfully executed in the state of origin, they must be accepted and \nhonored in the state in which they are presented, unless to do so would \nviolate state law.\n  All of the provisions in the Advance Directives Improvement and \nEducation Act of 2005 are there for one reason: to increase the number \nof people in the United States who have advance directives, who have \ndiscussed their wishes with their physicians and families, and who have \ngiven copies of the directives to their loved ones, health care \nproviders, and legal representatives.\n  This new Medicare benefit and education campaign will also lead to a \nreduction in litigation costs. By encouraging advance directives, cases \nlike Ms. Schiavo's would be less frequent; therefore the long and \ncostly litigation surrounding these unfortunate situations would be \nreduced.\n  Senators Rockefeller, Lugar and I all believe that as our Medicare \npopulation grows and life expectancy lengthens, improving care near the \nend of life must be a priority. Helping people complete these critical \ndocuments is an essential part of making the final journey as \nmeaningful and peaceful as possible. In addition, there are growing \nnumbers of health care providers, nonprofit organizations and consumer \nadvocates who recognize the need for change. New palliative care \nprograms, pain protocols and hospice services are being instituted in \nfacilities around the country.\n  This body is a legislative institution not a medical one--with the \nexceptions of the distinguished Majority Leader and Senator Coburn, of \ncourse. We cannot legislate good medical care or compassion. What we \ncan do, what I hope we will do, is to enact this bill so that the \nAmerican public can participate in improving end-of-life care--first, \nby filling out their own advance directives and talking to their \nfamilies about them; and by raising their voices to demand that our \nhealth care systems honor their wishes and improve the way they care \nfor people who are near the end of life. If we can do that, we will \nhave done a great deal.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Advance \n     Directives Improvement and Education Act of 2005''.\n       (b) Table of Contents.--The table of contents of this Act \n     is as follows:\n\nSec. 1. Short title; table of contents.\nSec. 2. Findings and purposes.\nSec. 3. Medicare coverage of end-of-life planning consultations.\nSec. 4. Improvement of policies related to the use and portability of \n              advance directives.\nSec. 5. Increasing awareness of the importance of end-of-life planning.\nSec. 6. GAO studies and reports on end-of-life planning issues.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Every year 2,500,000 people die in the United States. \n     Eighty percent of those people die in institutions such as \n     hospitals, nursing homes, and other facilities. Chronic \n     illnesses, such as cancer and heart disease, account for 2 \n     out of every 3 deaths.\n       (2) In January 2004, a study published in the Journal of \n     the American Medical Association concluded that many people \n     dying in institutions have unmet medical, psychological, and \n     spiritual needs. Moreover, family members of decedents who \n     received care\n\n[[Page S1276]]\n\n     at home with hospice services were more likely to report a \n     favorable dying experience.\n       (3) In 1997, the Supreme Court of the United States, in its \n     decisions in Washington v. Glucksberg and Vacco v. Quill, \n     reaffirmed the constitutional right of competent adults to \n     refuse unwanted medical treatment. In those cases, the Court \n     stressed the use of advance directives as a means of \n     safeguarding that right should those adults become incapable \n     of deciding for themselves.\n       (4) A study published in 2002 estimated that the overall \n     prevalence of advance directives is between 15 and 20 percent \n     of the general population, despite the passage of the Patient \n     Self-Determination Act in 1990, which requires that health \n     care providers tell patients about advance directives.\n       (5) Competent adults should complete advance care plans \n     stipulating their health care decisions in the event that \n     they become unable to speak for themselves. Through the \n     execution of advance directives, including living wills and \n     durable powers of attorney for health care according to the \n     laws of the State in which they reside, individuals can \n     protect their right to express their wishes and have them \n     respected.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to improve \n     access to information about individuals' health care options \n     and legal rights for care near the end of life, to promote \n     advance care planning and decisionmaking so that individuals' \n     wishes are known should they become unable to speak for \n     themselves, to engage health care providers in disseminating \n     information about and assisting in the preparation of advance \n     directives, which include living wills and durable powers of \n     attorney for health care, and for other purposes.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to designate Poland as a program country under the \nvisa waiver program established under section 217 of the Immigration \nand Nationality Act, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, along with \nSenator Mikulski, a bill that would designate Poland as a program \ncountry under the Visa Waiver Program under section 217 of the \nImmigration Nationality Act.\n  As we celebrate an historic period with the first Iraqi elections in \nover fifty years, it is important to appreciate the sacrifices our \nallies have made to make such an event possible. America must continue \nto solidify the bond with its allies by assisting their governments and \ncitizens when possible. This legislation brings us closer to a country \nthat has been by our side through a time of war and continues to be a \npartner in the global freedom.\n  Since the founding of the United States, Poland has proven its \nsteadfast dedication to the causes of freedom and friendship with the \nUnited States. This has been exemplified by the brave actions of Polish \npatriots such as Casimir Pulaski and Tadeusz Kosciuszco during the \nAmerican Revolution. Polish history provides pioneering examples of \ndemocracy and religious tolerance, and this is reflected in their \nconstitution that states, ``Freedom of faith and religion shall be \nensured to everyone.''\n  Poland's revolt from the Soviet Union's communist stranglehold is a \nmore recent example of their dedication to freedom. They are a prime \nexample of Ronald Reagan's vision to end the Cold War. Last year, when \nI met Lech Walesa, the tenacious leader of Poland's Solidarity movement \nand former President of Poland, I was reminded of the profound struggle \nthe country endured to bring democracy to their people.\n  And their commitment to preserving freedom and global security \ncontinues today. On March 12, 1999, Poland became a member of the North \nAtlantic Treaty Organization. This was followed by admission into the \nEuropean Union on May 1, 2004. Poland was a staunch ally to the United \nStates in Operation Iraqi Freedom and has committed 2,300 troops to \nhelp with the ongoing peace efforts in Iraq.\n  In addition to Poland's efforts as a global ally, its people have \ncontributed greatly within our borders. Nearly nine million people of \nPolish ancestry live in the United States. Polish immigrants have \nplayed an integral role in the success of industry and agriculture in \nPennsylvania and throughout the United States.\n  Currently, the United States administers the Visa Waiver Program to \ncitizens of twenty-seven countries. The program allows citizens from \nVisa Waiver Program countries to visit the United States as tourists, \nand Poland has earned the right to participate. I believe Poland \ndeserves to be the twenty-eighth country to participate in the program. \nThe 100,000 Polish citizens who visit the United States annually must \ncurrently pay a $100 fee to apply for a visa. Many of these applicants \nare visiting family, often for wedding celebrations or funerals. In an \nexpression of good faith, in 1991 the Polish government unilaterally \nrepealed the visa requirement for U.S. citizens traveling to Poland for \nless than 90 days.\n  I am aware of past concerns about Polish visa refusal rates, but a \ncloser look shows that refusal rates can be an inaccurate measure \nbecause they are based on decisions made by a very short interview \nprocess rather than the actual behavior of non-immigrants. Often, \nrefusal rates do not reflect the propensity of nationals from that \ncountry to overstay their visas. More importantly, Poland's refusal \nrate does not reflect a high propensity for terrorism. The State \nDepartment has given no indication that the potential for terrorism in \nPoland significantly exceeds that of the 27 countries currently \nparticipating in the Visa Waiver\n\n[[Page S1278]]\n\nProgram. Please be assured that I am sensitive to arguments that have \nconcerns about our national security at the core. However, our past \nhistory with Polish citizens visiting the United States does not favor \nthis argument.\n  For all Polish citizens and Polish Americans, I ask through this \nlegislation that Poland be deemed a designated program country for the \npurposes of the Visa Waiver Program. I ask my colleagues for their \nsupport.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to continue the fight to \nright a wrong in America's visa program. I believe it's time for \nAmerica to extend the Visa Waiver program to Poland. I'm pleased to \nhave formed a bipartisan partnership with Senator Santorum to \nreintroduce our bill to get it done.\n  Last fall, Senator Santorum and I met with a hero of the Cold War, \nLech Walesa. When he jumped over the wall of the Gdansk shipyard, he \ntook Poland and the whole world with him. He told us that the visa \nissue is a question of honor for Poland. That day, we introduced a bill \nto once again stand in solidarity with the father of Solidarity by \nextending the Visa Waiver program to Poland.\n  This morning, I had the honor of hosting Poland's Foreign Minister, \nProfessor Adam Rotfeld. We reaffirmed and cemented the close ties \nbetween the Polish and American peoples. Senator Santorum and I heard \nloud and clear that the visa waiver program remains a high priority for \nPoland.\n  My friends, Poland is not some Communist holdover or third-world \ncountry begging for a handout. The Cold War is over. Poland is a free \nand democratic nation. Poland is a NATO ally and a member of the \nEuropean Union. But America's visa policy still treats Poland as a \nsecond-class citizen. That is just wrong.\n  Poland is a reliable ally, not just by treaty but in deeds. Warsaw \nhosted an international Conference on Combating Terrorism less than two \nmonths after the September 11 attacks. Poland continues to modernize \nits Armed Forces so they can operate with the Armed Forces of the U.S. \nand other NATO allies, buying American F-16s and Shadow UAVs and \nhumvees.\n  More importantly, Polish troops have stood side by side with \nAmerica's Armed Forces. Polish ships participated in Desert Shield and \nDesert Storm during the 1990-91 Gulf War. Poland sent troops to Bosnia \nas part of UNPROFOR and IFOR. Poland sent troops as part of the \ninternational coalition in Afghanistan.\n  Polish troops fought alongside American and British and Australian \ntroops from day one of the Iraq war. They are there because they want \nto be reliable allies. Because they are ready to stand with us even \nwhen the mission is risky and unpopular. Today, Poland still commands \nmultinational forces in the South Central region of Iraq. Nearly 2,500 \nPolish troops are still on the ground in Iraq, sharing the burden and \nthe risk and the casualties.\n  So why are Singapore and San Marino among the 27 countries in the \nVisa Waiver program, but Poland is not?\n  President Kwasniewski raised this issue with President Bush last year \nand again this week. The President has said this is a matter for \nCongress. It's time for us to act.\n  The bill Senator Santorum and I are introducing today will add Poland \nto the list of designated countries in the Visa Waiver program. That \nwill allow Polish citizens to travel to the U.S. for tourism or \nbusiness for up to sixty days without needing to stand in line to get a \nvisa. That means it will be easier for Poles to visit family and \nfriends or do business in America. Shouldn't we make it easier for the \nPulaskis and Kosciuszkos and Marie Curies of today to visit our \ncountry?\n  We know that our borders will be no less secure because of these \nPolish visitors to our country. But we know that our alliance will be \nmore secure because of this legislation.\n  I urge our colleagues to join us in support of this important bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI:\n  S. 349. A bill to provide for the appointment of additional judges \nfor the district of New Mexico; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I introduce legislation that continues \nmy efforts to address a significant problem in the state of New Mexico, \na problem that the Judicial Conference of the United States has \npreviously described as a ``crisis.'' According to the latest survey by \nthe Judicial Conference, the weighted caseload for the District of New \nMexico is now the fourth highest in the Nation. This is in spite of the \nfact that in 2002 Congress approved a temporary judgeship for New \nMexico which the President has filled.\n  Based on this heavy workload, the Judicial Conference recently \nrecommended 2 additional permanent judgeships, as well as an additional \ntemporary judgeship for New Mexico; Only 2 districts in California, one \nin Florida, and one in New York were recommended to get more judgeships \nthan New Mexico. The legislation I have introduced today reflects this \nrecommendation.\n  In the 12-month period ending on June 30, 2002, the number of \ncriminal filings per judgeship increased from 222 to 320. This is \ncompared to the national average of 81. You don't have to be a \nmathematical genius to figure out that this is just short of four times \nthe national average. During this same time period, the number of \nweighted filings increased from 673 per judgeship to 739. The national \naverage is 504 and the Judicial Conference has set the benchmark at 430 \nweighted cases per judgeship. The District of New Mexico is clearly in \nneed of relief from this crisis.\n  The Sixth Amendment of the Constitution guarantees the right to a \nspeedy trial in all criminal cases. The United States Supreme Court has \ncalled this guarantee ``one of the most basic rights preserved by our \nConstitution,'' 386 U.S. 213. We must ensure that our States have the \nproper judicial resources to guarantee the basic right promised to \nAmericans more than 200 years ago. The bill that I am introducing \nprovides such necessary resources to New Mexico.\n  Without additional judges, this problem will only continue to grow as \nthe country focuses more intently on the security of our borders. I \nhope that my colleagues will act quickly to authorize these necessary \nadditional judgeships for New Mexico.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 349\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to provide \nassistance for orphans and other vulnerable children in developing \ncountries, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Assistance for \nOrphans and Other Vulnerable Children in Developing Countries Act of \n2005.\n  On October 7, 2004, I introduced S. 2939, a bill to improve our \nability to provide assistance to orphans and vulnerable children in \ndeveloping countries. Because of the gravity and urgency of the growing \nAIDS orphans crisis, I am reintroducing my bill.\n  The unprecedented AIDS orphan crisis in sub-Saharan Africa has \nprofound\n\n[[Page S1279]]\n\nimplications for political stability, development, and human welfare \nthat extend far beyond the region. Sub-Saharan African nations stand to \nlose generations of educated and trained professionals who can \ncontribute meaningfully to their countries' development. Orphaned \nchildren, many of whom are homeless, are more likely to resort to \nprostitution and other criminal behavior to survive. Most \nfrighteningly, these uneducated, poorly socialized, and stigmatized \nyoung adults are extremely vulnerable to being recruited into criminal \ngangs, rebel groups, or extremist organizations that offer shelter and \nfood and act as ``surrogate'' families. It is imperative that the \ninternational community respond to this crisis.\n  An estimated 110 million orphans live in sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, \nLatin America, and the Caribbean. The HIV/AIDS pandemic is rapidly \nexpanding the orphan population. Currently an estimated 14 million \nchildren have been orphaned by AIDS, most of whom live in sub-Saharan \nAfrica. This number is projected to soar to more than 25 million by \n2010. The pandemic is orphaning generations of African children and is \ncompromising the overall development prospects of their countries.\n  Most orphans in the developing world live in extremely disadvantaged \ncircumstances. Poor communities in the developing world struggle to \nmeet the basic food, clothing, health care, and educational needs of \norphans. Experts recommend supporting community-based organizations to \nassist these children. Such an approach enables the children to remain \nconnected to their communities, traditions, rituals, and extended \nfamilies.\n  My bill seeks to improve assistance to orphans and other vulnerable \nchildren in developing countries. It would require the United States \nGovernment to develop a comprehensive strategy for providing such \nassistance and would authorize the President to support community-based \norganizations that provide basic care for orphans and vulnerable \nchildren.\n  Orphans are less likely to be in school, and more likely to be \nworking full time. Yet only education can help children acquire the \nknowledge and develop the skills they need to build a better future.\n\n  For many children, the primary barrier to an education is the expense \nof school fees, uniforms, supplies, and other costs. My bill aims to \nimprove enrollment and access to primary school education by supporting \nprograms that reduce the negative impact of school fees and other \nexpenses. It also would reaffirm our commitment to international school \nlunch programs. Studies have shown that school food programs provide an \nincentive for children to stay in school. School meals provide basic \nnutrition to children who otherwise do not have access to reliable \nfood.\n  Many children who lose one or both parents often face difficulty in \nasserting their inheritance rights. Even when the inheritance rights of \nwomen and children are spelled out in law, such rights are difficult to \nclaim and are seldom enforced. In many countries it is difficult or \nimpossible for a widow--even if she has small children--to claim \nproperty after the death of her husband. This often leaves the most \nvulnerable children impoverished and homeless. My bill seeks to support \nprograms that protect the inheritance rights of orphans and widows with \nchildren.\n  The AIDS orphan crisis in sub-Saharan Africa has implications for \npolitical stability, development, and human welfare that extend far \nbeyond the region, affecting governments and people worldwide. Every 14 \nseconds another child is orphaned by AIDS. Turning the tide on this \ncrisis will require a coordinated, comprehensive, and swift response. I \nam hopeful that Senators will join me in backing this legislation.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my chairman of the \nSenate Foreign Relations I Committee, Senator Lugar, in reintroducing \nthe Assistance for Orphans and Other Vulnerable Children in Developing \nCountries Act. Today, we are reintroducing a bill that we worked on \ntogether in the 108th Congress--a bill that will help those most \nvulnerable to the HIV/AIDS pandemic throughout the world.\n  An estimated 14 million children have lost either one or both parents \nto HIV/AIDS. By the year 2010, It is estimated that this number will \ngrow to 25 million. The pandemic has created an orphans crisis, \nespecially in sub-Sahara Africa where this crisis is most severe.\n  The struggle of those orphaned by this pandemic is heartbreaking. \nThese children face the trauma of watching their parents die. They are \nforced at a very young age to care for their younger siblings while \nsuffering from deep poverty, hunger, and sicknesses.\n  A girl from Uganda who lost her parents to HIV/AIDS at age 11 told \nthe BBC:\n\n       When my mother died we suffered so much. There was no food, \n     and there was no one to look after us. We didn't even have \n     money to buy soap and salt. We wanted to run away to our \n     other grandparents, but we didn't have transport to go there. \n     I tried to be positive, but it was difficult. I missed my \n     mother because I loved her so much.\n\n  Picture this story repeated 14 million times throughout the world. We \ncannot stand by and allow this suffering to continue.\n  The Lugar-Boxer legislation that is being introduced today is \ndesigned to help these orphans and other vulnerable children who have \nbeen affected by the HIV/AIDS pandemic.\n  First, our bill would authorize the President to provide assistance \nto orphans and other vulnerable children in developing countries. \nSpecific authorization is provided in the areas of basic care, HIV/AIDS \ntreatment, school food programs, protection of inheritance rights, and \neducation and employment training assistance.\n  Second, this legislation calls on the President to use U.S. foreign \nassistance to support programs that eliminate school fees. Throughout \nthe world, many orphans are prevented from attending school because \nthey cannot afford to pay school fees or are forced to financially \nsupport their families or care for sick relatives.\n  And, third, our bill would require the President to develop and \nsubmit to Congress a strategy for coordinating, implementing, and \nmonitoring assistance programs for orphans and vulnerable children.\n  This strategy must include measurable performance indicators to \nensure that our policies are effective in helping orphans and \nvulnerable children.\n  Once again, Mr. President, I thank Chairman Lugar for working with me \non this bipartisan legislation. I also thank Congresswoman Lee for her \nleadership on this issue in the House of Representatives.\n  I hope my colleagues will join us in supporting this important bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Akaka, Mrs. Boxer, \n        Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Inouye, \n        Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Levin, Mr. Lieberman, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. \n        Sarbanes, and Mr. Reed):\n  S. 351. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for patient protection by limiting the number of mandatory \novertime hours a nurse may be required to work in certain providers of \nservices to which payments are made under the Medicare Program; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join my colleagues, \nSenators Kerry, Clinton, Sarbanes, Corzine, Mikulski, Dodd, Levin, \nReed, Lieberman, Feingold, Inouye, and Akaka in introducing the Safe \nNursing and Patient Care Act.\n  Current Federal safety standards limit work hours for pilots, flight \nattendants, truck drivers, railroad engineers and other professionals, \nin order to protect the public safety. However, no similar limitation \ncurrently exists for the nation's nurses, who care for so many of our \nmost vulnerable citizens.\n  The Safe Nursing and Patient Care Act will limit mandatory overtime \nfor nurses in order to protect patient safety and improve working \nconditions for nurses. Across the country, the widespread practice of \nmandatory overtime means that over-worked nurses are often providing \ncare in unacceptable circumstances. A recent study from the University \nof Pennsylvania School of Nursing found that nurses who work shifts of \ntwelve and a half hours or more are three times more likely to commit \nan error than nurses who work a standard shift of eight and a half\n\n[[Page S1280]]\n\nhours or less. Restrictions for mandatory overtime will help ensure \nthat nurses are able to provide the highest quality of care to their \npatients.\n  Some hospitals have already taken action to deal with this serious \nproblem. Over the last few years in Massachusetts, Brockton Hospital \nand St. Vincent Hospital agreed to limit mandatory overtime as part of \nnegotiations following successful strikes by nurses. These limits will \nprotect patients and improve working conditions for the nurses, and \nwill help in the recruitment and retention of nurses in the future.\n  Job dissatisfaction and harsh overtime hours are major factors in the \ncurrent shortage of nurses. Nationally, the shortfall is expected to \nrise to 20 percent in coming years. A major goal of the Safe Nursing \nand Patient Care Act is to improve the quality of life for nurses, so \nthat more persons will enter the nursing profession and remain in it.\n  Improving conditions for nurses is an essential part of our ongoing \neffort to reduce medical errors, improve patient outcomes, and \nencourage more Americans to become and remain nurses. The Safe Nursing \nand Patient Care Act is a significant step that Congress can take to \nsupport better quality care for all Americans, and improve working \nconditions for our nation's nurses, and I urge my colleagues to support \nit.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MIKULSKI (for herself, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Warner, \n        Mr. Chafee, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Levin, Mr. Salazar, Mr. Allen, Mr. \n        Kennedy, Mr. Jeffords, Ms. Collins, Mr. Sarbanes, Ms. Snowe, \n        Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Reed, Mr. Dayton, and Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 352. A bill to revise certain requirements for H-2B employers and \nrequire submission of information regarding H-2B non-immigrants, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation \nthat is desperately needed by small and seasonal businesses all over \nthe Nation. These businesses are in crisis. They need seasonal workers \nbefore the summer so that they can survive. For many years they have \nrelied on the H2B Visa program to meet these needs, but this year they \ncan't get the temporary labor they need because they have been shut out \nof the H-2B visa program. That program lets them hire temporary foreign \nworkers when no American workers are available.\n  So today, I join with my colleague Senator Gregg to introduce \nlegislation that provides a quick fix to the H-2B problem. The ``Save \nour Small and Seasonal Businesses Act'' will help these employers by \ndoing three things--temporarily exempting good actor workers from the \nH-2B cap, protecting against fraud in the H-2B program and providing a \nfair and balanced allocation system for H-2B visas. I urge my \ncolleagues to work with us to pass this legislation quickly to save \nthese businesses and the thousands of American jobs they provide.\n  Many in this body know about the H-2B crisis. All this week we have \nbeen talking about the litigation crisis--but a real crisis to \nthousands of small and seasonal businesses is the worker shortage they \nface as they approach the summer season. These small businesses count \non the H-2B Visa Program to keep their businesses afloat. And this \nyear, because the cap of 66,000 was reached so early in the year, many \nof these businesses will be unable to get the seasonal workers that \nthey need to survive.\n  Hitting the cap so early has had a great impact on Maryland. We have \na lot of summer seasonal businesses in Maryland, on the Eastern Shore, \nin Ocean City or working the Chesapeake Bay. Many of our businesses use \nthe program year after year. They hire all the American workers they \ncan find, but they need additional help to meet seasonal demands. \nBecause the cap was reached so early this year, for the second year in \na row, summer employers face a disadvantage. They can't use the \nprogram, so they can't meet their seasonal needs and many will be \nforced to limit services, lay-off permanent U.S. workers or, worse yet, \nclose their doors.\n  These are family businesses and small businesses in small communities \nin Maryland. If the business suffers the whole community suffers. For \nseafood companies like J.M. Clayton, what they do is more than a \nbusiness, it's a way of life. Started over a century ago and run by the \ngreat grandsons of the founder, J.M. Clayton works the waters of the \nChesapeake Bay, supplying crabs, crabmeat and other seafood, including \nMaryland's famous oysters, to restaurants, markets, and wholesalers \nallover the Nation. It is the oldest working crab processing plant in \nthe world and by employing 65 H-2B workers the company can retain over \n30 full-time American workers.\n  But its not just seafood companies that have a long history on the \nEastern Shore. It's companies like S.E.W. Friel Cannery, which began \nits business over 100 years ago when there were 300 canneries on the \nEastern Shore. But now those others are gone and Friel's is the last \ncorn cannery left. Ten years ago, when the cannery could not find local \nworkers, it turned to the new H-2B Visa Program. It has used the \nprogram every year since, and many workers are repeat users who come \neach year and then go home after the season. What's important is that \nhaving this help each year has not only allowed the company to maintain \nits American workforce, but it has paved the way for local workers to \nreturn to the cannery. They now employ 75 full time and 190 seasonal \nworkers, along with 70 farmers and additional suppliers.\n\n  Now these employers can't just turn to the H-2B program whenever they \nwant seasonal workers. First, employers must try to vigorously recruit \nU.S. workers. They must demonstrate to the Department of Labor that \nthere are no U.S. workers available. Only after that are they allowed \nto fill seasonal vacancies with H-2B visa workers. The workers that \nthey bring in often participate in the H-2B program year after year. \nThey often work for the same companies. But they cannot and do not stay \nin the U.S. They return to their home countries, to their families and \ntheir U.S. employer must go through the whole visa process again the \nfollowing year to get them back. That means an employer must prove \nagain to the Department of Labor that they cannot get U.S. workers.\n  This legislative fix keeps that visa process in place. It's a short-\nterm legislative fix to solve the immediate H-2B visa shortage. It does \nnot take the place of comprehensive immigration reform.\n  This legislation is a temporary two year fix. And it does four \nthings:\n  One, it exempts returning seasonal workers from the cap. These are \nworkers who have already successfully participated in the H-2B Visa \nProgram. They received a visa in one of the past three years and have \nreturned home to their families after their seasonal employment with a \nU.S. company.\n  Everyone must still play by the rules. Employers must go through the \nwhole visa process, prove they need the seasonal help and only after \nthat are returning employees exempt from the cap. Employees must be \nthose who have left the U.S. and are requesting a new H-2B visa to come \nback for another season. This new system rewards those who have played \nby the rules, worked hard and successfully participated in the program. \nAnd the bill gives a helping hand to businesses by allowing them to \nretain workers who they have already trained to do their seasonal jobs.\n  Next, this bill creates new anti-fraud provisions. To make sure that \neveryone is playing by the rules and that no one is misusing the \nprogram. And it gives government some teeth to prevent fraud and \nenforce our nation's immigration laws. A $150 anti-fraud fee ensures \nthat government agencies processing the H-2B visas will get added \nresources to detect and prevent fraud. New sanction provisions for \nthose who misrepresent facts on a petition further strengthens DHS's \nenforcement power. This section also sends a strong message to \nemployers--don't play games with U.S. jobs. Our bill reserves the \nhighest penalties for employer actions which harm U.S. workers.\n  And, this bill creates a fair allocation of visas. Now, summer \nemployers lose out because winter employers get all the visas. This \nbill makes the system fair for all employers. We reserve half of the \nvisas for the winter and half for the summer. Allocating visas ensures \nthat, until a long-term solution is reached, all employers will have an\n\n[[Page S1281]]\n\nequal chance of getting the workers that they need.\n  Finally, the bill adds some simple reporting requirements. So that \nDHS gives Congress the information it needs to make informed decisions \nabout the H-2B visa program in the future.\n  This is a quick and simple fix. It lasts just 2 years--the rest of \nthis year and next. And it does not get in the way of comprehensive \nimmigration reform.\n  I worked with my colleagues to get a bill with strong bipartisan \nsupport, a bill that would work.\n  This bill is realistic. It provides a temporary solution because \nimmediate action is needed to help these small and seasonal businesses \nstay in business. Yes, we need to help them now. Their seasons start \nsoon. And if they don't get seasonal workers this year, there may not \nbe any businesses around next year to help.\n  Every Member of the Senate who has heard from their constituents--\nwhether they are seafood processors, landscapers, resorts, timber \ncompanies, fisheries, pool companies or carnivals--knows the urgency in \ntheir voices, knows the immediacy of the problem and knows that the \nCongress must act now to save these businesses. I urge my colleagues to \njoin this effort, support the Save our Small and Seasonal Businesses \nAct, and push this Congress to fix the problem today.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 352\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 352, the \nSave Our Small and Seasonal Businesses Act. This legislation, which I'm \nproud to cosponsor, would provide emergency relief to thousands of \nsmall and seasonal businesses across the country, many of which are \nsignificant employers in the Commonwealth of Virginia.\n  I am pleased to be joined in this effort by my colleague from \nVirginia, Senator George Allen. I particularly would like to thank \nSenator Barbara Mikulski and Senator Judd Gregg, the sponsors of this \nbipartisan bill, for their leadership in this area.\n\n[[Page S1282]]\n\n  Our legislation is simple. It makes common-sense reforms to our H-2B \nvisa program that will allow our small and seasonal companies an \nopportunity to remain open for business. Without these modifications, \nthese employers will continue to struggle in their efforts to find the \nnecessary employees to keep their businesses running.\n  The H-2B visa program is designed to allow nonagricultural businesses \nto supplement their workforce with non-immigrant workers when American \nworkers cannot be found. The cap is set at 66,000 per fiscal year, \nwhich begins on October 1 of each year. Employers can only apply for a \nvisa 120 days before the work is needed.\n  For each of the last two years, this statutory cap was reached soon \nafter the fiscal year began. In 2004, the cap was reached on March 20. \nAs a result, many businesses, mostly summer employers, were unable to \nobtain the temporary workers they needed because the cap was filled \nprior to the day they could even apply for the visas.\n  Consequently, these businesses sustained significant economic losses.\n  This year the H-2B visa cap was reached on January 3, 2005. Now, even \nmore businesses, especially in the seafood industry which has a long \nhistory in Virginia and the Chesapeake Bay, are susceptible to \nsignificant losses.\n  The hardships in these and other businesses are very real. Many in \nthe seafood industry in Virginia have come to my office, looked me \nstraight in the eye, and told me that their businesses aren't going to \nmake it another year if something isn't done. Only through passage of \nthis legislation can this detrimental cycle be interrupted and these \nbusiness can be saved.\n  There are three main criticisms of this program which I am certain \nsome will raise: these H-2B workers are taking jobs away from \nAmericans; automation of these jobs makes H-2B workers unnecessary; and \nfinally, these workers come into the U.S. under the guise of returning \nhome after they've finished, but they never do. In my view, these \ncriticisms of the H-2B program simply do not reflect the reality.\n  Believe me, I am a strong supporter of efforts to help those \nAmericans who want to work get the skills they need to be successful in \nthe workforce. But these H-2B workers are not taking jobs from \nAmericans, they are filling in the gaps left vacant by Americans that \ndon't want them. The jobs we are talking about here are seasonal, labor \nintensive, and require a certain amount of skill, mainly in the areas \nof oyster and crab harvesting, seafood processing, landscaping, \nreforestation, and seasonal resorts and other hospitality services.\n  Furthermore, most of these jobs cannot be automated. What kind of \nmachine will you use to fully landscape a yard, to arrange and plant \nflowers? Some in the seafood industry already tried to automate parts \nof crab harvesting, but it was a complete failure. The machines failed \nto remove most of the bits of crab shells from the meat, and the \nconsumers flat out rejected it.\n  As for the criticism that these temporary workers won't leave, a long \nreview of the management of this program reveals otherwise. The \nemployers have successfully ensured that the workers return to their \nhome country. If they don't, employers aren't able to participate in \nthe program next year, and neither are the workers. Most consulates in \ntheir home countries require the workers to present themselves \npersonally to prove that they have returned home.\n  The future success of the H-2B visa program rests on the ability of \nbusinesses to participate in it, but right now, many will be denied \naccess to the program for the second year in a row. The bill introduced \ntoday helps fix this problem by focusing on three main objectives to \nhelp make the H-2B program more effective and more fair.\n  First, the bill will reward good workers and employers by exempting \nfrom the cap H-2B workers who have participated in the program \nsuccessfully in one of the past three years. These are companies and \nemployees that have faithfully abided by the law, and they have a \nsuccessful track record of working together.\n  Second, the bill will make sure that the government agencies \nprocessing the H-2B visas have the resources they need to detect and \nprevent fraud. Starting on October 1, 2005, employers participating in \nthe program will pay an additional fee that will be placed in a Fraud \nPrevention and Detection account. The Departments of State, Homeland \nSecurity, and Labor can use these funds to educate and train their \nemployees to prevent and detect fraudulent visas.\n  Finally, the bill implements a visa allocation system that is fair \nfor all employers. Half of the 66,000 visas will be reserved for \nemployers needing workers in the winter and the other half will be \nreserved for companies needing workers for the summer. This provision \nallows both winter employers and summer employers an equal chance to \nobtain the workers they desperately need.\n  These seasonal businesses just can't find enough American workers to \nmeet their business needs. And ultimately, that is why this program is \nso important. Without Americans to fill these jobs, these businesses \nneed to be able to participate in the H-2B program. The current system \nisn't treating small and seasonal businesses fairly and must be \nreformed if we want these employers to stay in business.\n  In closing, I strongly support this legislation, and I hope my \ncolleagues in the Senate will join with me to help these small and \nseasonal businesses by passing this legislation as quickly as possible.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am proud to be a strong supporter and \noriginal cosponsor of the Save Our Small and Seasonal Businesses Act, \nwhich is being introduced today. This legislation will ensure that the \nseasonal businesses in our country have the workers they need to \nsupport our economy and enable the economy to flourish.\n  I would first like to thank Senators Mikulski and Gregg for bringing \nsuch a large, bipartisan group of Senators together to create this \nlegislative solution. Last year, the United States Citizenship and \nImmigration Services announced in March that they had received enough \npetitions to meet the cap on H-2B visas. As a result, they stopped \naccepting petitions for these temporary work visas halfway through the \nFederal fiscal year. This announcement was a shock to many businesses \naround the country that depend on foreign workers to fill their \ntemporary and seasonal positions.\n  Tourism is the largest sector of Vermont's economy and as a result, \nmany Vermont businesses hire seasonal staff during their winter, summer \nor fall foliage seasons. Last year, I heard from many Vermont \nbusinesses that they were unable to employ foreign workers for their \nsummer and fall seasons because the cap had been reached. Not only was \nthis unexpected, but many of the employees were people who had been \nreturning to the same employer year after year. These employers lost \nessential staff and, in many cases, well trained, experienced staff.\n  Many employers told me it is extremely difficult to find Americans to \nfill these seasonal positions, especially in areas of Vermont where the \nunemployment rate is less than 2 percent. One Vermont resort only \nsurvived Vermont's fall foliage season because of the dedication of \ntheir permanent employees. Instead of 35 housekeeping staff, they made \ndo with 8. Staff was asked to work 12 to 14 hours per day, 6 or 7 days \nper week. At this particular resort, the vice president, general \nmanager, administrative and technology managers, and marketing manager \nall cleaned rooms. While they are proud of the work of their staff, \nthey believe their business and their personnel will suffer if they are \nnot able to employ seasonal foreign workers again this year. They \nforesee a devastating effect on the family business they have owned and \noperated for the past 40 years if they are not able to bring in foreign \nworkers soon.\n  I have also heard from Vermont businesses that had to lay off or not \nhire American workers because they could not find enough employees to \nfill their crews. Without the workers to complete projects, they could \nnot hire or maintain their year-round staff. They also could not bid on \nprojects and many had to scale back their operations. In these \ninstances, the lack of seasonal workers had a direct effect on our \neconomy and the employment of American workers.\n  As many may know, I believe strongly that American workers must be\n\n[[Page S1283]]\n\ngiven the opportunity to fill jobs and strengthen our nation's \nworkforce. However, the companies I have referred to today, and all of \nthe others that have contacted me, did their utmost to find Americans \nfor the positions available. Efforts to find workers included: working \nclosely with the State of Vermont's Employment and Training office; \nincreasing wages and benefits; and implementing aggressive year-round \nrecruiting.\n  While many Vermont businesses were able to survive last year, thanks \nto that old Yankee ingenuity, I am not optimistic about this year. The \ncap on H-2B visas was reached in early January, barely a quarter of the \nway through the fiscal year. It is imperative we immediately address \nthis problem in order to prevent further harm to this Nation's small \nbusinesses and the economy.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the recent shortage of H-2B nonimmigrant \nvisas for ernporary or seasonal non-agricultural foreign workers is a \nmatter of great concern to many small businesses in my home state of \nMaine, particularly those in the hospitality sector that rely on these \nseasonal workers to supplement their local employees during the height \nof the tourism season.\n  On January 4, a mere three months into fiscal year 2005, the U.S. \nCitizenship and Immigration Services, CIS, announced that it would \nimmediately stop accepting applications for H-2B visas because the \nannual statutory cap of 66,000 visas had been met. In other words, many \nemployers who require temporary workers in the spring, summer, or fall \nwill be unable to hire such workers because all 66,000 H-2B visas \nalready will have been issued within the first few months of the fiscal \nyear. Once again, Maine's employers will be left out in the cold, \ndisadvantaged by the simple fact of their later tourism season.\n  Without these visas, employers will be unable to hire enough workers \nto keep their businesses running at normal levels. Last year, unable to \nlocate enough American workers willing and able to take these jobs, and \nwithout temporary foreign workers to fill the gap, many business owners \nwere forced to initiate stop-gap measures that were neither ideal nor \nsustainable in the long term. Many of these businesses fear that, this \nyear, they will have to decrease their hours of operation during what \nis their busiest time of year. This would translate into lost jobs for \nAmerican workers, lost income for American businesses, and lost tax \nrevenue from those businesses. These losses will be significant, and \nthey can be avoided.\n  Today, I am pleased to join Senators Mikulski and Gregg, along with \nseveral other of my distinguished colleagues, in introducing the Save \nOur Small and Seasonal Businesses Act of 2005. Similar to legislation \nthat I cosponsored last year, as well as legislation that I have \nintroduced in the current Congress, this bill would exclude from the \ncap returning workers who were counted against the cap within the past \n3 years. This legislation also seeks to address the inequities in the \ncurrent system by limiting the number of H-2B visas that can be issued \nin the first 6 months of the fiscal year to no more than 33,000 visas, \nor one half of the total number of visas available under the cap. By \nallocating visas equally between each half of the year, employers \nacross the country, operating both in the winter and summer seasons, \nwill have a fair and equal Opportunity to hire these much-needed \nworkers.\n  In addition, this legislation includes important new anti-fraud \nprovisions that will strengthen our ability to detect, prevent, and \ndeter, fraud by those who would seek to abuse the H-2B program. These \ninclude sanctions for employers who are found to have misrepresented II \nIf facts on an H-2B petition, and the creation of a Fraud Prevention \nand Detection Fee of $150 for each H-2B petition. Similar to anti-fraud \nfees charged in other visa categories, funds raised from this fee will \nbe placed in an account with the U.S. Treasury and made available to \nthe agencies involved in processing H-2B visas--CIS, the Department of \nLabor, and the Department of State--to educate and train employees to \nrecognize and protect against fraud in the visa applicant process.\n\n  I believe that this anti-fraud fee serves a worthy goal, and that the \ngovernment agencies should have the resources they need to ensure the \nintegrity of the H-2B visa application process. However, I am concerned \nabout the impact that a fee of this size, in addition to the filing \nfees that employers already pay, may have on many smaller businesses. I \nintend to examine this issue further in order to ensure that smaller \nbusinesses are not unfairly impacted by this provision.\n  We must act quickly on this legislation, or we will be too late to \nhelp thousands of American businesses that need our help now. We cannot \nbe content to say: ``It's too late for this year; maybe next year.'' It \nis true that comprehensive, long-term solutions may be necessary, but \nwe have immediate needs as well. This problem demands immediate \nsolutions.\n  In my home state of Maine, the economic impact of this visa shortage \nwill be harmful and widespread. When people think of Maine, what often \ncomes to mind is its rugged coastline, picturesque towns and villages, \nand its abundant lakes and forests. Not surprisingly, tourism is the \nstate's largest industry. Temporary and seasonal workers play an \nimportant role in this very important industry.\n  Unfortunately, there are not enough American workers willing and able \nto fill the thousands of jobs necessary to provide the level of service \nthat Maine's visitors have come to expect. Over the years, seasonal \nworkers have filled this gap, becoming an integral part of Maine's \ntourism and hospitality industry. In Fiscal Year 2003, the last time \nMaine's employers were able to fully utilize the H-2B program, Maine \nemployed more than 3,000 seasonal workers. The majority of these \nindividuals worked in the State's resorts, inns, hotels, and \nrestaurants. Many are people who have returned to the same employer \nsummer after summer.\n  Let me emphasize that employers are not permitted to hire these \nforeign workers unless they can prove that they have tried, and failed, \nto locate available and qualified American workers through advertising \nand other means. As a safeguard, current regulations require the U.S. \nDepartment of Labor to certify that such efforts have occurred before \nCIS will process the visa applications. In Maine, as in other States, \nour state Department of Labor takes the lead in ensuring that employers \nhave taken sufficient steps to try to find local workers to fill the \npositions. Unless and until more H-2B visas are made available, many \nseasonal jobs will remain unfilled and American businesses will suffer.\n  A similar situation faces Maine's forest products industry, which \ncontributes approximately $5.6 billion annually to Maine's economy. In \n2003, more than 600 temporary workers--mostly from Canada--were \nemployed as forestry workers in Maine. Many work in remote areas of the \nstate where there are not enough Americans able to take these jobs. By \nsome estimates, these foreign workers account for as much as 30-40 \npercent of the wood fiber that supplies paper and saw mills throughout \nMaine and the Northeast. This number represents roughly 4.8 million \ntons of wood annually. With an already significant shortage in the wood \nsupply, the loss of these temporary workers poses a serious threat to \nthe industry and to Maine's economy. With fewer workers available to \nbring wood out of the forest and into mills, supplies will dwindle, \nprices will continue to rise, and mills may be forced to curtail \nproduction, or even temporarily discontinue operations. If this \nhappens, it is American workers that may lose their jobs.\n  The effects of the H-2B visa shortage are not limited to the tourism \nand forest products industries, however. It will also be felt by \nfisheries and lobstermen, junior league hockey and minor league \nbaseball teams. It win affect small businesses and large, visitors and \nlocals, young and old, from Maine to Maryland, to Wyoming and Alaska.\n  Mr. President, the shortage of nonimmigrant temporary or seasonal \nworker visas is a problem that must be addressed, and soon. I believe \nthat this legislation offers a workable short-term solution, and I urge \nus to move forward. We must resist the tendency to let this problem, \nand the people who are affected by it, become entangled in the larger \ndebate about our Nation's\n\n[[Page S1284]]\n\nimmigration policies. This is not about the number of immigrants we \nshould allow to come to the United States each year, or what to do with \nthose who violate our immigration laws. It is about temporary workers \nwho, for the most part, respect our laws, go home at the end of their \nauthorized stay, and in many cases, return again next year to provide \nservices that benefit our Nation's economy. It is about American \nbusinesses that rely on these workers to take jobs that many Americans \ndo not want. It is about the economic impact that will be felt across \nthe Nation if these businesses are unable to hire temporary workers. We \nneed to solve this problem now, before it is too late and our economy \nis harmed and jobs lost.\n   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Save Our Small \nand Seasonal Businesses Act being introduced by Senator Mikulski today. \nThis legislation offers a measured approach to provide needed relief to \nthe many small businesses that have been struggling to find enough \nemployees to operate during seasonal spikes in workload. Small \nbusinesses that are seasonal often need a large number of employees for \na short portion of the year, but cannot afford to retain the same \nnumber of people as full-time, year-round employees. They instead must \nrely on temporary workers to fill the gap in their high season. In my \nhome State of Maryland, for example, our seafood processors are busy in \nthe summer and early fall, but have very little work in the winter. To \naccommodate this changing need, they hire college students and local \nresidents as extra workers in the summer. But even with those workers \nthey often find themselves short-staffed. So they turn to temporary \nemployees who are willing to leave their home countries for a few \nmonths to come to the U.S. and work.\n  Specifically, the bill being introduced today will allow anyone who \nhas had an H-2B visa for one of the last 3 years to return this summer \nor next if an employer petitions for them to do so. Importantly, \nemployers still must demonstrate that they have tried and failed to \nfind available, qualified U.S. citizens to fill these jobs before they \nfile an H-2B visa application. In addition, the bill would ensure that \nour summer employers are not disadvantaged by allowing no more than \nhalf of the 66,000 visas to be allocated in the first half of the year. \nFinally, the bill imposes antifraud fees on employers who willfully \nmisrepresent any statement on their H-2B petition and requires the \nDepartment of Homeland Security to file reports on the demographics of \nthose utilizing the H-2B program.\n  Any changes to our immigration laws must balance the interests of \nU.S. citizens and our economy while providing a fair, legal framework \nfor those seeking to come to our Nation from other countries. For \nexample, our current immigration laws already contain several general \nreasons an alien seeking admission into the United States may be denied \nentry: security and terrorist concerns, health-related grounds, \ncriminal history, public charge, i.e., indigence, seeking to work \nwithout proper labor certification, illegal entry and/or immigration \nlaw violations, lack of proper documents, ineligibility for \ncitizenship, and previous removal. Ensuring the safety of our country \nrequires preserving these categories.\n  This legislation would leave this existing framework intact. It \nsimply provides a fair and equitable means of distributing a very \nscarce number of visas so that all employers who require extra \nassistance during one season of the year may obtain that assistance. We \nmust resist the temptation to let the H-2B situation and the small \nbusinesses affected by it become entangled in the larger debate over \nimmigration reform. Workers who use H-2B visas come to the U.S. for a \ntemporary period of time and are required to leave when that time \nperiod has run. These workers respect our laws, work hard, provide \nservices that benefit our economy, and then return to their families at \nthe end of the season. For their sake and that of the small, seasonal \nbusinesses that rely on them, we need to resolve this H-2B crisis soon.\n  Without this fix, our seafood processors cannot operate at full \ncapacity. That becomes a problem for the rest of the seafood industry, \nincluding our watermen, who will be forced to curtail their fishing \nbecause of an insufficient number of locations to process their \ncatches. In the end, the people who suffer are not the seafood \nprocessors or the temporary workers but the watermen who cannot feed \ntheir families. This bill provides the assistance necessary to keep our \nwatermen, seafood processors, and a number of other industries such as \nlandscapers, pool operators, and summer camps working at full capacity \nthis summer. I urge my colleagues to support its passage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CONRAD (for himself and Mr. Dorgan):\n  S. 353. A bill to amend the Water Resources Development Act of 1999 \nto direct the Secretary of the Army to provide assistance to design and \nconstruct a project to provide a continued safe and reliable municipal \nwater supply system for Devils Lake, to the Committee on Environment \nand Public Works.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nauthorize the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to construct a new municipal \nwater supply system for the city of Devils Lake, ND. This project is \nvery important to the reliability of the water supply for the residents \nof Devils Lake and is needed to mitigate long-term consequences from \nthe rising flood waters of Devils Lake.\n  As many of my colleagues know, the Devils Lake region has been \nplagued by a flooding disaster since 1993. During that time, Devils \nLake, a closed basin lake, has risen 25 feet, consuming land, \ndestroying homes, and impacting vital infrastructure. As a result of \nthis disaster, the city of Devils Lake faces a significant risk of \nlosing its water supply. Currently, six miles or approximately one-\nthird of the city's 40-year-old water transmission line is covered by \nthe rising waters of Devils Lake. The submerged section of the water \nline includes numerous gate valves, air relief valves, and blow-off \ndischarges.\n  All of the water for the city's residents and businesses must flow \nthrough this single transmission line. It is also the only link between \nthe water source and the city's water distribution system. Since the \ntransmission line is operated under relatively low pressures and is \nunder considerable depths of water, a minor leak could cause \nsignificant problems. If a failure in the line were to occur, it would \nbe almost impossible to identify the leak and make necessary repairs, \nand the city would be left without a water supply.\n  The city is in the process of accessing a new water source due both \nto the threat of a transmission line failure and the fact that its \ncurrent water source exceeds the new arsenic standard that will take \naffect in 2006. The city has worked closely with the North Dakota State \nWater Commission in identifying a new water source that will not be \naffected by the rising flood waters and will provide the city with \nadequate water to meet its current and future needs.\n  The bill I am introducing today will authorize the Corps to construct \na new water supply system for the city. I believe the Federal \nGovernment has a responsibility to assist communities mitigate the \nadverse consequences resulting from this ongoing flooding disaster. In \nmy view, the Corps should be responsible for addressing the unintended \nconsequences of this flood and mitigate its long-term consequences. \nThis bill will help the Federal Government live up to its \nresponsibility and ensure that the residents of Devils Lake have a safe \nand reliable water supply. I urge my colleagues to review this \nlegislation quickly so we can pass it this year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DORGAN (for himself and Mrs. Clinton):\n  S. 355. A bill to require Congress to impose limits on United States \nforeign debt, to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, there are many issues we confront these \ndays that are significant and serious. I wanted to bring one to the \nattention of the Chamber as I introduce legislation.\n  I send a bill to the desk and ask for its appropriate referral on \nbehalf of myself and Senator Clinton.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill will be received and appropriately \nreferred.\n\n[[Page S1285]]\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this legislation deals with trade. Let me \ndescribe what was announced this morning by the administration.\n  Last year's trade deficit was $618 billion. You can see from this \nchart what has happened in the last 8 or 9 years. Our trade deficit has \ngone in the red by a dramatic amount, ending up at $618 billion for \n2004.\n  What does that mean? That means we purchased from other countries \n$618 billion worth of goods more than we sold to other countries. In \nother words, every single day, 7 days a week, $1.8 billion leaves this \ncountry and goes into foreign hands to pay for goods that we purchased \nfrom abroad.\n  As a result, foreign entities have $2.5 trillion worth of claims \nagainst our assets, our property, our stocks, and our assets. We are, \nwith our trade policies, selling America.\n  With China alone, we have a $161 billion trade deficit. This is \nunbelievably out of balance. We purchase China's trinkets, trousers, \nshirts, and shoes. Now they're making plans to ship Chinese automobiles \nto this country.\n  By the way, as I told my colleagues before, in the last trade \nagreement with China we agreed they could charge a tariff on imported \nU.S. cars which is 10 times higher than the tariff we can charge on \nChinese cars sold in the United States.\n  Who did that? I don't know; some trade negotiator.\n  It is the same old story with cars from China, cars from Korea, wheat \nto China, beef to Japan. It is the same old story.\n  I mentioned to my colleagues many times what Will Rogers said in the \n1930s: ``The United States of America has never lost a war and never \nwon a conference.'' He said we can't send negotiators to Costa Rica and \ncome back with our shirts on. He surely must have been thinking about \nthe people who had been negotiating trade agreements that resulted in \nthese kinds of deficits.\n  Now our trade deficit on a yearly basis is over 5 percent of our \ngross domestic product. Who holds this debt? Japan holds $715 billion \nof asset claims against our country, and China, $191 billion.\n  Does anybody think this is healthy for our country? This kind of \ntrade deficit and combined trade debt is going to injure America's \nfuture economic growth and continue to accelerate the movement of U.S. \njobs overseas. That is what is behind all of these numbers.\n  American corporations in recent decades have discovered that you can \nmove technology and capital at the speed of light. And they have \ndiscovered there are a billion people in other parts of the world who \nare willing to work for 30 cents an hour. When you can ship technology \nand capital to someone overseas willing to work for 30 cents an hour, \nyou begin to hollow out the manufacturing sector in this country.\n  The news this morning of the largest trade deficit in the history of \nthis country is sober news. This town will sleep through it once again. \nThe White House will sleep through it, and so will the Congress. It \ndoesn't matter much to most people.\n  We have a debt limit in this country that says once the government \nborrows a certain amount, we have to have a debate, and vote on it. \nOtherwise, you can't go any further.\n  But there is no trade debt limit. Whatever the trade debt is, it is. \nKaty bar the door, no matter how high it is. There is no requirement to \ndo anything about it.\n\n  The legislation I introduced, along with my colleague Senator \nClinton, will establish a trade debt limit and a trade deficit limit. \nWhen the trade deficit exceeds 5 percent of our gross domestic product, \nthen it requires certain things. It is an alarm clock that requires the \nadministration's trade review group to have an emergency meeting, and \nwithin 45 days the administration and the trade ambassador have to \nsubmit to Congress a plan to reduce the trade deficit.\n  Somebody someplace, someday, some way has to decide the current \nsituation can't continue. This is all about jobs and future economic \nopportunity. This is real, and it is immediate. And we have to do \nsomething about it.\n  That is why we have introduced this legislation. This country has \nbeen in a deep sleep about an abiding trade problem in which we link \nwith other countries in bilateral agreements. In almost every case \nthese are not mutually beneficial. Instead, the agreements are \nbeneficial to them and detrimental to us. Yet, we have people on street \ncorners chanting ``free trade.''\n  I think trade is fine, I think fair trade is important, and I think \nexpanding trade is valuable. But I believe free trade, if it means a \ntrade agreement which undercuts this country's ability to compete, free \ntrade which pulls the rug out from under our workers, and establishes \nconditions under which we cannot compete, is wrong for this country.\n  I will not go through again the list of issues of potato flakes going \nto Korea, beef to Japan, wheat to China. I could go through dozens of \nthem. I will not do that again today. My point is that at some point \nsomebody has to have the backbone and the will and the nerve to stand \nup for this country's economic interests. That has not been done for a \nlong while. It needs to be done now because this trade deficit has \nreached crisis proportions.\n  One final chart: Some said that last month the trade deficit was \nactually a little better than the month before. This is a town of \nwarped reality on a lot of issues. Let me describe what has happened to \nour trade deficit month by month since 1998. It does not take a sharp \neye to see what is happening.\n  This trade deficit is growing. It is dangerous. It is harmful to the \nlong-term economic interests of this country. We have to do something \nabout it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Nelson of \n        Florida, Mrs. Clinton, and Mr. Martinez):\n  S. 357. A bill to expand and enhance post baccalaureate opportunities \nat Hispanic-serving institutions, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the next \ngeneration of Hispanic Serving Institutions legislation. This \nlegislation is critical if we, as a Nation, are going to continue to \ncompete in a global economy. Education is the key to building a strong \nand dynamic economy, and therefore, it is our obligation to ensure \nquality educational opportunities for all Americans. That is why I am \nintroducing, along with my colleague Senator Hutchison, the Next \nGeneration Hispanic Serving Institutions Act of 2005. This legislation \nis supported by the Hispanic Education Coalition, an ad hoc coalition \nof national organizations dedicated to improving educational \nopportunities for more than 40 million Hispanics living in the United \nStates, including groups like National Council of La Raza, HACU, and \nMALDEF. Senators Bill Nelson and Clinton have joined in this effort as \ncosponsors.\n  According to Census Bureau data, Hispanic population in the United \nStates grew by 25.7 million between 1970 and 2000 and continues to grow \nat a very brisk pace. The most recent census data puts the Hispanic \npopulation at over 40 million, representing approximately 14 percent of \nthe U.S. population and making it the Nation's largest minority group. \nEstimates project that the Hispanic population will grow by 25 million \nbetween 2000 and 2020. By the year 2050, 1 in 4 Americans will be of \nHispanic origin.\n  Currently, Hispanics make up about 13 percent of the U.S. labor \nforce. While the overall labor force is projected to slow down over the \nnext decades as an increasing number of workers reach retirement age, \nthe Hispanic labor force is expected to continue growing at a fast \npace. It will expand by nearly 10 million workers between now and 2020, \nthrough a combination of immigration and native-born youth reaching \nworking age.\n  Our Nation's economic and social success rests, in large part, on the \nlevel of skills and knowledge attained by our Hispanic population.\n  I was one of the authors and lead supporters of the original Hispanic \nServing Institutions proposal when it was enacted as part of the Higher \nEducation Act in 1992 in order to increase educational opportunities \nfor Hispanic students. Since then, Hispanic-Serving Institutions, HSIs, \nhave made significant strides in increasing the number of Hispanic \nstudents enrolling in and graduating from college. Although Hispanic-\nserving institutions account for only 5 percent of all institutions of \nhigher education in the United States,\n\n[[Page S1286]]\n\nHSIs enroll over half, 51 percent, of all Hispanics pursuing higher \neducation degrees in the 50 States, the District of Columbia and Puerto \nRico.\n  While Hispanic high school graduates go on to college at higher rates \nthan they did even ten years ago, Hispanics still lag behind their non-\nHispanic peers in postsecondary school enrollment. In 2000, only 21.7 \npercent of all Hispanics ages 18 through 24 were enrolled in \npostsecondary degree-granting institutions in the United States.\n  We must take HSIs to the next level. While the percentage of \nHispanics attending college has increased significantly over the past \nfew years, Hispanic students are disproportionately enrolled in 2-year \ncolleges, and are much less likely to finish college than their non-\nHispanic peers. In 2001, only slightly more than 1 in 10 Hispanics ages \n25 years and over had received a bachelor's degree or higher.\n  According to the Department of Education, in 2000, Hispanics only \nearned 6 percent of all bachelor's degrees awarded, 4 percent of all \nmaster's degrees, and only 3 percent of all doctorates. But the pace of \nbachelor's degrees or higher earned by Hispanics is accelerating \nrapidly, according to the Department of Education. Therefore, we must \nkeep pace. We must increase the capacity of our institutions of higher \neducation to serve the increasing number of Hispanic students.\n  The Next Generation HSI bill does just that. Simply, this legislation \nwill improve educational opportunities for Hispanic students by \nestablishing a competitive grant program to expand post-baccalaureate \ndegree opportunities at HSIs, and by eliminating unnecessary and \nburdensome administrative requirements HSIs must contend with.\n  Current law only provides support for 2-year and 4-year Hispanic \nServing Institutions. This legislation will support graduate \nfellowships and support services for graduate students, facilities \nimprovement, faculty development, technology and distance education, \nand collaborative arrangements with other institutions. This \nlegislation will build capacity and establish a long overdue graduate \nprogram for HSIs.\n  In addition, current law places a number of unnecessary, burdensome \nadministrative and regulatory barriers at the gates of our HSIs. If our \ngoal is to increase educational opportunities for all students, and \nparticularly Hispanic students, then we must eliminate bureaucratic \nbarriers that impede access.\n  Accordingly, this legislation removes a 2-year period in which HSIs \nmust wait before becoming eligible to apply for another grant under \ntitle V of the Higher Education Act. This 2-year wait out period \nobstructs the efforts of many HSIs to implement continuing programs and \nconduct long range planning. As a result, many HSIs cannot maintain \ncontinuity in educational programming. We should be creating \nopportunities to improve the quality of education, and eliminating this \nwait-out period is a step in the right direction.\n  In addition, this bill eliminates another onerous requirement on HSIs \nthat other minority-serving institutions are not required to follow. \nCurrently, in order to be eligible as an HSI, the institution must \nserve ``needy students''--meaning at least 50 percent of the degree \nstudents are receiving Federal need-based assistance or the \ninstitution's percentage of Pell Grant recipients exceeds the median \npercentage for similar institutions receiving Pell Grants. Also, to be \neligible, 25 percent of the full time, undergraduate population must be \nHispanic. However, unlike other grant programs in the Higher Education \nAct, HSIs must also show that 50 percent of the Hispanic population is \nlow income.\n  This last requirement is particularly burdensome, as it is \nduplicative and unfair, and, in many cases, prevents HSIs from \nproviding vital educational services to Hispanic students. This \nprovision requires the institutions to collect information and data \nthat is not readily available or easily acquirable. It requires the \nschools to come up with data beyond what is required for financial aid \npurposes. Further, there is no other requirement in Federal law for \ninstitutions to collect this type of data. As a result, many \ninstitutions with large Hispanic student populations must divert \ncritical resources and staff to acquire this information, or they \nsimply do not qualify as an HSI.\n  To ensure that the institution continues to serve low-income \nstudents, the Next Generation HSI Act maintains the requirement that \nthe institution serve needy students, but eliminates the additional \nrequirement that the school demonstrate that 50 percent of its Hispanic \nstudents are low-income. The elimination of this requirement will ease \nthe administrative burdens placed on our schools, and further our goals \nof increasing access and improving quality.\n  Finally, this bill facilitates the transition of Hispanic students \nfrom 2-year colleges to 4-year colleges. As I noted earlier, Hispanics \nare disproportionately enrolled in 2-year colleges as compared to their \nnon-Hispanic peers. To encourage and support these students' continued \neducation, this legislation adds as an authorized activity programs \nthat assist a student's transfer from a 2-year institution to a 4-year \ninstitution.\n  Hispanic students now account for nearly 17 percent of the total \nkindergarten through grade 12 student population. Estimates project \nthat this student population will grow from 11 million in 2005 to 16 \nmillion in 2020. We must provide our institutions of higher education \nwith the resources and flexibility they need to build capacity and \nserve the increasing Hispanic student population. We must be ready for \nthe next generation of students to meet the demands of a competitive \nworkforce and to fully participate in the global economy. I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 357\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that \nwill amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to revise provisions for \nHispanic-serving institutions, HSIs, under Title V, Developing \nInstitutions. The changes will expand opportunities in postgraduate \neducation, an essential part of our economy that enables our workforce \nto maintain the knowledge that keeps our nation at the forefront of \nscience and technology.\n  The bill will establish a program of competitive grants for HSIs that \noffer post-baccalaureate certifications or degrees. Grants will support \ngraduate fellowships, services for students, facilities improvement and \nfaculty development, among other things. It authorizes $125 million in \ngrants for fiscal year 2006, and will reduce red tape by eliminating \nthe requirement that an HSI certify half of its students are low-\nincome, thus making it easier for students to transfer from two to four \nyear colleges.\n  According to the 2000 Census, Hispanics represent the nation's \nlargest minority population. Unfortunately, too few graduate from high \nschool or college, despite being the fastest-growing ethnicity in that \nage group. We need more resources to support Hispanic educational \nopportunities. Hispanic-Serving Institutions are currently educating 51 \npercent of the 457,000 Hispanic higher education students in the United \nStates. Although HSIs account for 5 percent of all institutions of \nhigher education, almost one-half of the 1.5 million Hispanic students \ncurrently in college programs attend them.\n  Between 1991 and 2000, the number of Hispanics earning master's \ndegrees grew 136 percent and the number of doctor's degrees grew 85 \npercent. Our Nation's economic strength and prosperity will depend on \nthe knowledge, skills, and leadership of a population that already \nmakes up one of three new workers joining the U.S. labor force today.\n  As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I have been \ncommitted to increasing federal support of HSIs. Since 1995, Title V \nfunding has increased from $12 million to $95 million in fiscal year \n2005. I believe this is an important investment to ensure our nation's \nyoungest and largest ethnic population has access to the educational \nopportunities needed to excel.\n  Because I believe the success of Hispanic students will play a \ncritical role in determining this country's future, I am proud to offer \nthis bill that will improve options for graduate and postgraduate \nstudy, and I urge my colleagues to support it. Mr. President, I ask \nunanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the Record.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Specter, Mr. Byrd, Mr. \n        Rockefeller, Mr. Cochran, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Bayh, and Mr. \n        Sarbanes):\n  S. 358.

A bill to provide for the adjustment of status of certain \nforeign agricultural workers, to amend the Immigration and Nationality \nAct to reform the H-2A worker program under that Act, to provide a \nstable, legal agricultural workforce, to extend basic legal protections \nand better working conditions to more workers, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I have introduced what I believe to be a \nvery important piece of legislation that the Senate will consider this \nyear, dealing with an issue that is certainly on the minds of many \nAmericans and No. 1 on the minds of some Americans. It is on the \nquestion of immigration reform and dealing with it in an appropriate \nfashion, to create a transparency in the process, and to begin to end \nand identify the 8 million to 12 million undocumented foreign nationals \ncurrently in our country.\n  Over the last 5 years, I have worked in a bipartisan way with many of \nmy colleagues, and literally hundreds of organizations around the \ncountry, in focusing on a specific area of immigration, and that is the \nH-2A area, or those who work in agricultural employment.\n  What we have discovered over the course of time is a broken system, \nwhich in large part now allows the possibility of well over a million \nforeign nationals working illegally in this country, but working in an \neconomy where they are desperately needed to bring the food products \nfrom our fields, to process those products and put them on the shelves \nof the American consuming public. As a result of that great concern, I, \nworking with my colleague Senator Ted Kennedy in the Senate, with \nCongressman Howard Berman and Congressman Chris Cannon over in the \nHouse for some time, have produced legislation that brings all sides of \nthis very diverse and oftentimes very contentious issue together, to \ntherefore be able to offer tonight a piece of legislation that has at \nthis moment nearly 40 Members of the Senate, Democrats and Republicans, \nsupporting it; whereas last year, identical legislation had over 63 \nSenators, and we believe we will have that same support again this \nyear.\n  Americans, after 9/11, cried out to the Congress and to our \nGovernment, saying: What is wrong? Why were people allowed to come to \nour country who then turned on us to kill our citizens? Why did we let \nthat happen?\n  Well, we learned that the immigration policies of our country were \nlargely broken and that the Congress, over years and years, had turned \nits back on the issue, either not funding immigration appropriately or \nnot enforcing the laws already on the books regarding immigration.\n  As a result of that, it is now estimated that there are between 8 \nmillion to 12 million foreign nationals living in this country, the \nvast majority of them working and living in law-abiding, peaceful ways, \nbut working here to better themselves and their families for their own \nhuman well-being. We did find out there were a few who were here to do \nevil things to Americans.\n  In the legislation I bring to the floor tonight, in legislation we \ncall the Agricultural Job Opportunity Benefit and Security Act, I focus \nrather narrowly on what is believed to be about 1.6 million of the \ntotal number, to recognize that clearly the vast majority of them are \nhere for peaceful purposes, to better themselves and their families, \nand, in the meantime, cause American agriculture to work as effectively \nand efficiently as it does.\n  Oftentimes, these men and women do work that American citizens do not \nwant to do or will not do--toiling in the hot fields of American \nagriculture day in and day out, dirty, tough work, but seeing it as an \nopportunity for themselves and an opportunity for their children to \nhave a better life.\n  In so failing to recognize that need, we have oftentimes caused them \nto live in the back alleys and the shadows of America in an illegal \nstatus, but we still rely heavily on them for the services they \nprovide.\n  Americans need and expect a stable, predictable, legal workforce in \nAmerican agriculture, and consumers in our country deserve a safe, \nstable, domestic food supply. Willing American workers deserve a system \nthat puts them first in line for the jobs that are available with a \nfair market wage, and our legislation does that. All workers deserve \ndecent treatment and protection of basic rights under the law, and our \nlegislation does that. American citizens and taxpayers deserve secure \nborders, a safe homeland, and a government that works, and our \nlegislation helps accomplish those three very important goals.\n  Yet we are threatened on all fronts because of a growing shortage now \nof legal workers in American agriculture. Last year, in 2 of the 12 \nmonths, we were net importers of agricultural food products. For the \nfirst time in the history of our country that happened. I grew up being \ntold--and most of us did--that because of our great American \nagriculture always being able to feed us, we were a secure, safe \nnation, and our food supply was such that we would never be dependent \nupon foreign interests to feed the American consumer.\n  Last year it happened 2 out of 12 months that we grew dependent. This \nyear, USDA tells us that we will break even at about 50-50. There will \nbe no surplus agriculture trade. We will be importing as much as we are \nexporting, and that will be a historic first for our Nation.\n  What it tells me, as someone who grew up in American agriculture, is \nthat agriculture as an economy is becoming increasingly fragile. It no \nlonger has the strength or the dynamics it once had. It grows \nincreasingly dependent on the high cost of inputs--energy, equipment, \nother supplies necessary to produce the bounty of the American farm \nfield. But one of those key inputs is labor--labor that is stable, \nlabor that you know will be there, and, most importantly, labor that \ncan get the job done at the right time,\n\n[[Page S1289]]\n\nwhen the crop in the field is ripe and ready to harvest.\n\n  That labor pool is largely undocumented today. It is estimated that \nanywhere from 72 to 75 percent of those who work in American \nagriculture today are undocumented foreign nationals; in other words, \nillegal. And yet they toil in the fields, they pick our food, they help \nprepare it through the processing plants to get it to the consumer's \nshelf.\n  If in our effort to protect our borders and to create a law \nenforcement community that can apprehend a person who has entered this \ncountry illegally, if all of that happens and we do not create a system \nthat stabilizes and provides a legal foreign national workforce, we \ncould literally collapse American agriculture.\n  We are working at trying to protect our borders. We have invested \nheavily in it for the last good number of years. We just passed an \nintelligence reform bill in the latter part of the last session of the \n108th Congress dealing closely with our borders. Members on the House \nside are ready to introduce new forms of legislation to tighten up and \nallow the driver's license to become a more secure legal \ndocumentation--an American citizen versus one who would not be.\n  I support nearly all of those things because they are the right thing \nto do for America to reclaim herself and to control her borders. But at \nthe same time, there is a legitimate and responsible need to recognize \nthe importance--the critical importance--of foreign nationals in our \nworkforce helping to provide for our economy.\n  In the late nineties, we were near 100-percent employment in our \ncountry. Anyone who wanted to work could work and was working. Those \nwho were not probably either did not want to or could not. Yet during \nthat time, we were still employing an estimated 8 million foreign \nnationals in our country. That is not a negative, that is the character \nof a great country. That is the character of a great economy and a \nstrong economy.\n  It is also that diversity that has produced the great American way, \nthe idea of the American dream, the phenomenal hybrid vigor of a \ndiverse character that is this country and has always been. And \nAmerican agriculture has been a part of that. Those who toil in \nAmerican agriculture have been a big part of that.\n  What we do today by this legislation is reach out and attempt to \nrecognize those who are here in an undocumented way and cause them to \ncome forward to be recognized, to have a background check done, to make \nsure they are not law violators or felons who are here for some other \npurpose. If they have been here and worked a period of 100 days since \nJanuary 1, 2005, we will provide for them a temporary green card and \nthen allow them to work and earn the right for permanent work status in \nour country.\n  To me, that seems fair and responsible. All of the parties involved \nin American agriculture today from the workforce to the producer \nthemselves, they, too, agree that is a fair and responsible fashion. It \nis not giving anything away. It is attempting to correct a problem. It \nis doing the background checks. It is making sure we have a legal and \nlegitimate workforce so that as we plug all of these holes and change \nthe character of a broken immigration law, we do so without collapsing \nthe very economy that feeds our country, recognizing that they became \ntoo dependent as agricultural producers on a workforce that was not \nlegal.\n  So we do not just wipe the workforce away. We attempt to identify it, \nshape it, and cause it to be legal and do so in a responsible fashion. \nThat is clearly what our legislation does. That is why 63 Senators \nsupported it last year, and well over 100 in the House were cosponsors \nof it. We are working hard at this very moment to pass this \nlegislation, to get it to the President's desk, and recognize that it \nmay be a template, it may be a pilot for others to look at for a more \ncomprehensive approach toward immigration reform.\n  There is no question in my mind that our immigration laws are broken, \nand I am not going to stand here tonight and suggest I have the wisdom \nto fix it all. But I and others and hundreds of organizations and \ninterest groups from around this country have spent the last 5 years \ntrying to solve this problem.\n  When we started, many of us were 180 degrees apart. Slowly but surely \nwe came together out of need, the clear recognition of the necessity of \nproviding a legal, recognizable, and stable workforce for American \nagriculture.\n  I do not think any citizen in our country would sleep well if they \nknew that a majority of our foodstuffs were imported, if they knew that \nwe were dependent upon foreign nations and their producers for our food \nsupply.\n  I think they would grow frustrated over the risk that would be at \nhand there, the stability, the availability, the safety issue. Many \nhave suggested that if we are going to have a terrorist attack again \nsome day, one of the approaches terrorists might use would be to attack \nour food supply.\n  If we control our workforce, if we produce it here, the possibility \nof that happening is considerably lessened. That goes right back to the \nold historic belief that a nation that can feed itself and its people \nis a nation that is inherently stable, and without question the produce \nof the American farm has allowed us to be that generation after \ngeneration, war after war.\n  We are now at a very fine point and balance in our Nation's history \nwhere this year we will zero out that old historic belief of stability. \nWe will be importing as much as we are exporting. So American \nagriculture deserves our attention.\n  The people who labor there deserve our attention and respect. They \ndeserve to be treated fairly as we would expect all people in our \ncountry to be, to have proper conditions and proper wages and to be \nrecognized for the quality of work they do, instead of simply shoving \nthem into the shadows in the back streets of America and denying they \nare there but knowing that we need them. That is an interesting \ncontradiction in the current immigration laws in our country and \nAmerica knows it and has reacted accordingly.\n  It is why our President says immigration reform is critical and \nnecessary and has proposed ways to accomplish it. It is why it is in \nthe top list of issues and concerns that most Americans hold about what \nGovernment ought to be doing to create a safer, stronger America, from \ncontrolling our borders to an effective law enforcement system, to \nassuring that we know those who are within our borders and why they are \nhere and what their intent is. That is all part of the agricultural \njobs bill we introduce tonight, the Agricultural Job Opportunity \nBenefit and Security Act of 2005.\n  I am proud that 40 Senators, nearly 50-50 in partisan split, have \nalready endorsed this legislation. We will strive for that number of \n60-plus again. In doing so, I will ask my colleagues to help us bring \nthis bill to the floor very early in this session, to debate it, to \npass it out, to work with our House colleagues and to put it on the \nPresident's desk. I believe it is a positive and necessary start in \nmarching down the road toward comprehensive immigration reform.\n  To do anything less than we are proposing is once again to do the \nvery thing we have done for well over a decade, and that is to turn our \nback on the problem and the issue, to know it is there but to deny it \nexists, and then to have a broken system produce the crisis that \noccurred on 9/11.\n  We are a better country than that, and this Senate is a more \nresponsible legislative body than that.\n  So tonight I bring to my colleagues what I think is a major first \nstep in immigration reform necessary and important to protecting our \nborders, to making sure we are secure at home, to stabilizing a food \nsupply, to assuring that American agriculture has a predictable, stable \nworkforce, and to say to all at hand that those who come here to toil, \nin the benefit of the American economy, will be treated in a fair, \njust, and responsible way.\n  I yield the floor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 360. A bill to amend the Coastal Zone Management Act; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Coastal Zone \nEnhancement Reauthorization Act of 2005. I am pleased to have worked \nwith my cosponsor, Senator Kerry, in developing this bill, which will \nenable our\n\n[[Page S1290]]\n\nNation to improve the way we manage our valuable, yet vulnerable, \ncoastal resources.\n  More than three decades ago, Congress enacted the Coastal Zone \nManagement Act of 1972, or CZMA, in response to concerns over growing \nthreats to our Nation's coastal environments and resources. While this \nact has been instrumental in facilitating better coastal planning and \nmanagement, the September 2004 Final Report of the U.S. Commission on \nOcean Policy reminded us that the pressures facing our coastal regions \nhave greatly increased since the CZMA was enacted.\n  America's coastal zone comprises only 17 percent of the contiguous \nU.S. land area, yet nearly 53 percent of all Americans live in these \ncoastal areas. Attracted by economic opportunity as well as beaches and \nother recreational amenities, more than 3,600 people are moving to this \narea each year. This relatively small portion of our country supports \napproximately 361 sea ports, including most of our largest cities. At \nthe same time, it provides critical habitat for a variety of plants and \nanimals, ranging from rare microscopic organisms to commercially \nvaluable fish stocks.\n  The CZMA established a unique State-Federal framework for \nfacilitating sound coastal planning, and any amendments to this act \nmust uphold and strengthen this arrangement. Under the authorities in \nthe CZMA, coastal States can elect to participate in a voluntary \nFederal Coastal Zone Management Program. The 34 participating States \nand territories create individualized coastal zone management plans, \ntaking their State's specific needs and problems into account, and then \nreceive Federal matching funds to help implement their plans. This \nsystems respects states' rights while empowering them to better \nidentify and meet their environmental, social, and economic goals for \ntheir coastal areas. As a result of this program's success, more than \n99.9 percent of the United States 95,376 shoreline miles are managed \nunder this system.\n  Even though our coastal States and territories have benefitted from \nthis vital CZMA program, our coastal areas continue to face increasing \ndemands to expand working waterfronts as well as increasing rates of \nnonpoint source water pollution. These persistent threats have outpaced \nthe ability of many States to keep up with coastal zone conservation. \nAlthough the States are currently taking action to address this problem \nunder existing authorities, the Coastal Zone Enhancement \nReauthorization of 2005 would encourage them to take additional \nvoluntary steps to combat these problems through the Coastal Community \nProgram.\n  The coastal community initiative would provide participating States \nwith the funding and flexibility necessary to deal with a broad array \nof specific nonpoint source pollution problems.\n  The State of Maine, like many coastal States, is working to reduce \nnonpoint source pollution programs, and its efforts have led to the \nreopening of hundreds of acres of shellfish beds and the restoration of \nfish nursery areas. Even with these successes, Maine needs to do more \nand is looking forward to this new opportunity.\n  The Coastal Community Program authorized in this bill would also aide \nStates in developing and implementing creative, community-based \ninitiatives to deal with problems other than nonpoint source pollution. \nIt would increase Federal and State support of local grassroots \nprograms that target coastal environmental issues, such as the impact \nof development and sprawl on coastal resources and activities.\n  The bill I offer today would reauthorize the CZMA and make a number \nof improvements to strengthen our Nation's coastal management system. \nThe Coastal Zone Enhancement Reauthorization of 2005 significantly \nincreases the authorization levels for the Coastal Zone Management \nProgram, enabling States to better achieve their coastal management \ngoals. The bill authorizes $137.5 million for fiscal year 2006 and \nincreases the authorization levels up to $160,000,000 for fiscal year \n2010. This increase in funding would enable the States' coastal \nprograms to achieve their full potential.\n  Within these authorized funding levels, this bill would increase \nauthorization for the National Estuarine Research Reserve System to $18 \nmillion in fiscal year 2006 with an additional $1 million increase each \nyear through fiscal year 2010. This system is a network of reserves \naround the country that support coastal science, research, education \nand conservation, and they are operated as a cooperative Federal-State \npartnership. Additional authorizations, including funds to support \nconstruction at designated reserve sites, will help strengthen this \nnationwide program which has not received increased funding \ncommensurate with the addition of new reserves.\n  In this bill, we have tried to rectify a very serious problem facing \nthe Coastal Zone Management Program. The funding for this program is \nbased on administrative grants, under section 306 of the CZMA, in which \nthe amount of funding for each State is determined by a formula that \ntakes into account both the length of the coastline and population of \neach State. However, since 1992, the Appropriations Committee has \nimposed a million a $2 million cap per State on administrative grants \nin an attempt to treat all participating States equally.\n  Even while overall program funding has increased in recent years, \nthis arbitrary cap has remained in place, and by fiscal year 2000, 13 \nStates had reached it. These 13 States account for 83 percent of our \nNation's coastline and 76 percent of our coastal population. Despite \nappropriators' desire for equal treatment, it is simply not equitable \nto have the 13 States with the largest coastlines and populations stuck \nat a $2 million cap, despite overall program funding increases. While \nsmaller States have enjoyed additional programmatic success due to an \ninflux of funding, progress in some of the larger States--with some of \nthe most pressing coastal management problems--has stagnated.\n  This bill contains new language that would direct the Secretary of \nCommerce to ensure equitable increases or decreases in annual \nadministrative grant funding for each State. It further 2 requires that \nStates should not experience a decrease in base program funds in any \nyear when the overall appropriations increase. I must thank my former \ncolleague, Senator Hollings, for his many years of effort and \ncooperation in helping us develop this new grant funding allocation \nlanguage. His leadership and commitment to all ocean and coastal \nconservation matters continues to guide our efforts today.\n  The State-Federal Coastal Zone Management Program has a long record \nof helping States achieve their coastal area management goals, and \nhaving clean, safe, and productive coastlines ultimately serves the \nbest interest of our Nation. This program enjoys widespread support \namong coastal States, as demonstrated by the many Commerce Committee \nmembers who have worked with me to strengthen this program over the \npast several years.\n  I am pleased to introduce this legislation to provide our coastal \nStates with the funding and management frameworks necessary to meet the \never-increasing conservation and development challenges facing our \ncoastal communities, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Coastal Zone \nEnhancement Reauthorization of 2005 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 360\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to develop and maintain an integrated system of ocean \nand coastal observations for the Nation's coasts, oceans and Great \nLakes, improve warnings of tsunamis and other natural hazards, enhance \nhomeland security, support maritime operations, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Ocean and \nCoastal Observation Systems Act of 2005, a bill that would forever \nchange our understanding of the marine environment.\n  As our Nation saw with the devastating Indian Ocean tsunami only \nweeks ago, the oceans are alive and ever-changing. While our Nation's \ncoast escaped the direct reach of this recent tragedy, it reminds us \nthat those who live near or along our Nation's 95,000-plus miles of \nshoreline need to be able to monitor a range of ocean conditions and \nquickly assess ocean-based threats, including tsunamis, hurricanes, \nharmful algal blooms, and pollution. The purpose of this bill is to \nfulfil these needs for ocean and coastal observation and warning \nsystems surrounding the United States.\n  This bi-partisan, science-based bill would authorize the National \nOceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, to establish and \nmaintain an integrated network of ocean observing and communication \nsystems around our Nation's coastlines. This system would collect \ninstantaneous data and information on ocean conditions--such as \ntemperature, wave height, wind speed, currents, dissolved oxygen, \nsalinity, contaminants, and other variables--that are essential to \nmarine science and resource management as well as maritime \ntransportation, safety, and commerce.\n  As Chair of the Fisheries and Coast Guard Subcommittee of the \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, and as a \nrepresentative of a state with more than 5,000 miles of shoreline, I \nwant to ensure that the citizens of Maine, and all coastal states, have \nthe tools they need to monitor and assess what is happening off their \nshores. The State of Maine has a strong and proud history rooted in our \nconnection to the sea, as do other coastal states, and our coastal \ncommunities are highly dependent on the fisheries resources, coastal \nhabitats, tourist destinations, safe harbors, and other essential \nservices connected to the sea. The people of this country's livelihoods \nare directly linked to how well we understand and adapt to changing \nocean conditions.\n  Our ability to understand ocean dynamics took a great leap forward in \n2001, when marine scientists and educators launched an innovative \npartnership known as the Gulf of Maine Ocean Observing System, or \nGoMOOS, to start gathering a range of ocean data on a large regional \nscale. This prototype system, which started with ten observation buoys, \nhas transformed how we observe and track ocean conditions over time. \nThe GoMOOS system takes ocean and surface condition measurements on an \nhourly basis through a network of linked buoys, and these real-time \nmeasurements can be monitored and accessed by the public via the GoMOOS \nWeb site. The unprecedented geographical range and frequency of \nmeasurements revolutionized our knowledge about the Gulf of Maine, and \nGoMOOS continues to provide a tremendous public service for New \nEngland.\n\n  Of course, the need to access this type of ocean information is not \nlimited to the Gulf of Maine. Similar observing systems are planned or \ndeveloped in other coastal regions, many in conjunction with NOAA, \nuniversities, and State agencies. Data from these independent regional \nsystems, however, are often incompatible with data from other regions, \nmaking it difficult to compile, manage, process, and communicate data \nacross networks. As a result, there is a possibility that these systems \nwould be unable to link their data and develop a comprehensive picture \nof coastal and ocean conditions around the Nation.\n  The Ocean and Coastal Observation Systems Act of 2005 seeks to \nrectify this situation by integrating ocean and coastal observation \nefforts in cooperation with NOAA. This Act would encourage further \ndevelopment of the regional systems, enable their data to be linked \nthrough a national network, provide information that anyone could \naccess, and facilitate timely public warnings of hazardous ocean \nconditions. It would authorize the National Ocean Research Leadership \nCouncil to have general oversight for research and\n\n[[Page S1294]]\n\ndevelopment of this national undertaking. This Council would establish \nan interagency program office that would plan and coordinate \noperational activities and budgets, and NOAA would be the lead Federal \nagency charged with ensuring that this national network of regional \nobservation associations, such as GoMOOS and others under development, \neffectively integrates and utilizes ocean data for the benefit of the \nAmerican public.\n  As the U.S. Ocean Commission made clear in its final report issued in \nSeptember 2004, ocean and coastal observations are a cornerstone of \nsound marine science, management, and commerce, and the potential uses \nof this system are nearly unlimited. For example, fisheries scientists \nand managers can use ocean data to better predict ocean productivity \nand use this information to facilitate ecosystem management. Fishermen, \nsailors, shippers, Coast Guard search-and-rescue units, and other \nseafarers can better monitor sea conditions to more safely navigate \nrough seas. Ocean scientists and regulators can better predict and \nrespond to marine pollution, harmful algal bloom outbreaks, or other \nhazardous conditions and issue prompt alerts to potentially vulnerable \ncommunities. Clearly, anyone who uses and depends upon the ocean stands \nto benefit from this integrated system.\n  I am very proud to introduce this bill, and I would like to thank my \ncosponsors, Senators Kerry, Stevens, and Inouye, for contributing to \nthis legislation and supporting this national initiative. Of course, \nour current and expanding ocean observation and communication system \nwould not be possible without the work of dedicated professionals in \nthe ocean and coastal science, management, and research communities--\nthey have taken the initiative to develop the grassroots regional \nobservation systems as well as contribute to this legislation. Thanks \nto their ongoing efforts, ocean observations will continue to provide a \ntremendous service to the American ocean-dependent public.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 361\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Ocean and Coastal \n     Observation System Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Ocean and coastal observations provide vital \n     information for protecting human lives and property from \n     marine hazards, enhancing national and homeland security, \n     predicting weather and global climate change, improving ocean \n     health and providing for the protection, sustainable use, and \n     enjoyment of the resources of the Nation's coasts, oceans, \n     and Great Lakes.\n       (2) The continuing and potentially devastating threat posed \n     by tsunamis, hurricanes, storm surges, and other marine \n     hazards requires immediate implementation of strengthened \n     observation and communications systems to provide timely \n     detection, assessment, and warnings to the millions of people \n     living in coastal regions of the United States and throughout \n     the world.\n       (3) The 95,000-mile coastline of the United States, \n     including the Great Lakes, is vital to the Nation's \n     prosperity, contributing over $117 billion to the national \n     economy in 2000, supporting jobs for more than 200 million \n     Americans, handling $700 billion in waterborne commerce, and \n     supporting commercial and sport fisheries valued at more than \n     $50 billion annually.\n       (4) Safeguarding homeland security, conducting search and \n     rescue operations, responding to natural and man-made coastal \n     hazards such as oil spills and harmful algal blooms, and \n     managing fisheries and other coastal activities require \n     improved monitoring of the Nation's waters and coastline, \n     including the ability to track vessels and to provide rapid \n     response teams with real-time environmental conditions \n     necessary for their work.\n       (5) While knowledge of the ocean and coastal environment \n     and processes is far from complete, advances in sensing \n     technologies and scientific understanding have made possible \n     long-term and continuous observation from shore, from space, \n     and in situ of ocean and coastal characteristics and \n     conditions.\n       (6) Many elements of a ocean and coastal observing system \n     are in place, but require national investment, consolidation, \n     completion, and integration at Federal, regional, State, and \n     local levels.\n       (7) The Commission on Ocean Policy recommends a national \n     commitment to a sustained and integrated ocean and coastal \n     observing system and to coordinated research programs in \n     order to assist the Nation and the world in understanding the \n     oceans and the global climate system, enhancing homeland \n     security, improving weather and climate forecasts, \n     strengthening management of ocean and coastal resources, \n     improving the safety and efficiency of maritime operations, \n     and mitigating marine hazards.\n       (8) In 2003, the United States led more than 50 nations in \n     affirming the vital importance of timely, quality, long-term \n     global observations as a basis for sound decision-making, \n     recognizing the contribution of observation systems to meet \n     national, regional, and global needs, and calling for \n     strengthened cooperation and coordination in establishing a \n     Global Earth Observation System of Systems, of which an \n     integrated ocean and coastal observing system is an essential \n     part.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to provide \n     for--\n       (1) the development and maintenance of an integrated ocean \n     and coastal observing system that provides the data and \n     information to ensure national security and public safety, \n     support economic development, sustain and restore healthy \n     marine ecosystems and the resources they support, enable \n     advances in scientific understanding of the oceans, and \n     strengthen science education and communication;\n       (2) implementation of research and development and \n     education programs to improve understanding of the oceans and \n     Great Lakes and achieve the full national benefits of an \n     integrated ocean and coastal observing system;\n       (3) implementation of a data and information management \n     system required by all components of an integrated ocean and \n     coastal observing system and related research to develop \n     early warning systems; and\n       (4) establishment of a system of regional ocean and coastal \n     observing systems to address local needs for ocean \n     information.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to establish a program within the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration and the United States Coast Guard to help \nidentify, determine sources of, assess, reduce, and prevent marine \ndebris and its adverse impacts on the marine environment and navigation \nsafety, in coordination with non-Federal entities, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n[[Page S1296]]\n\n                       RESEARCH AND REDUCTION ACT\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Marine Debris \nResearch and Reduction Act. From the shore, our oceans seem vast and \nlimitless, but I fear that we often overlook the impacts our actions \nhave on the sea and its resources. The Act that I am introducing today \nwith my friends and colleagues, Senators Stevens, Cantwell, Snowe, \nKerry, and Lautenberg, focuses on one particular impact that goes \nunnoticed by many: marine debris. I am proud to say that the Senate \nunanimously passed this bill in the 108th Congress, and we look for \nswift action on this legislation again this year.\n  In a high-tech era of radiation, carcinogenic chemicals, and human-\ninduced climate change, the problem of the trash produced by ocean-\ngoing vessels or litter swept out to sea must seem old-fashioned by \ncomparison. Sea garbage would seem to be a simple issue that surely \ncannot rise to the priority level of the stresses our 21st century \ncivilization places on the natural environment.\n  Regrettably, that perception is wrong. While marine debris includes \nconventional ``trash,'' it also includes a vast array of additional \nmaterials. It is discarded or lost fishing gear. It is cargo washed \noverboard. It is abandoned equipment from our commercial fleets. Nor \ndoes the ``low-tech'' nature of solid refuse diminish its deadly impact \non the creatures of the sea. Whether an animal dies from a immune \nsystem weakened by toxic chemicals, or drowns entangled in a discarded \nfishing net, the result is the same--and in many cases, preventable.\n  Global warming, disease, and toxic contamination of our seas has \nalready stressed these fragile ecosystems. These threats have been \ndescribed in last year's Final Report of the U.S. Commission on Ocean \nPolicy, which also dedicated an entire chapter to the threats posed by \nmarine debris. The bill we introduce today adopts the measures \nrecommended by the Commission to help remove man-made marine debris \nfrom the list of ocean threats. It also follows the recommendations of \nthe International Marine Debris Conference held in my home State of \nHawaii in 2000.\n  The bill establishes a Marine Debris Prevention and Removal Program \nwithin the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA, \ndirects the U.S. Coast Guard to improve enforcement of laws designed to \nprevent ship-based pollution from plastics and other garbage, \nreinvigorates an interagency committee on marine debris, and improves \nour research and information on marine debris sources, threats, and \nprevention.\n  In Hawaii, we are able to see the impacts of marine debris more \nclearly than most because of the convergence caused by the North \nPacific Tropical High. Atmospheric forces cause ocean surface currents \nto converge on Hawaii, bringing with them the vast amount of debris \nfloating throughout the Pacific. Since 1996, a total of 484 tons of \ndebris have been removed from coral reefs in the Northwestern Hawaiian \nIslands, which is also home to many endangered marine species. But the \njob is not done, because more arrives daily. In 2004 alone, the program \nremoved over 125 tons of debris.\n  I am pleased that the coordinated approach taken to address the \nthreats posed by marine debris in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands has \nprovided a model for the nation. NOAA's Pacific Islands Region \nFisheries Science Center is leading this interagency partnership, which \nalso includes the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Hawaii's business and \nuniversity communities, and conservation groups. Not only have we \nremoved debris that poses harm to endangered species, but with the help \nof donated services, we have recycled the abandoned nets into energy to \npower residential homes.\n  We have learned that our best path to success lies in partnering with \none another to share resources, and it is my hope that others may adapt \nour project to their own shores through the partnership and funding \nopportunities set forth in this bill. This is why the bill strengthens \nand reestablishes an Interagency Committee on Marine Debris to \ncoordinate marine debris prevention and removal efforts among federal \nagencies state governments, universities, and nongovernmental \norganizations.\n  We must also bear in mind that no matter how zealously we reform our \npractices, the ultimate solution lies in international cooperation. The \noceans connect the coastal nations of the world, and we must work \ntogether to reduce this increasing threat to our seas and shores. The \nMarine Debris Research and Reduction Act will provide he United States \nwith the tools to develop effective marine debris prevention and \nremoval programs on a worldwide basis, including reporting and \ninformation requirements that will assist in the creation of an \ninternational marine debris database.\n  Mr. President, I hope you will join me in supporting enactment of the \nMarine Debris Research and Reduction Act. This bill will provide the \nUnited States with the programs and resources necessary to protect our \nmost valuable resources, our oceans. I ask unanimous consent that the \nfull text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 362\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Marine Debris Research \n     Prevention and Reduction Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The oceans, which comprise nearly three quarters of the \n     Earth's surface, are an important source of food and provide \n     a wealth of other natural products that are important to the \n     economy of the United States and the world.\n       (2) Ocean and coastal areas are regions of remarkably high \n     biological productivity, are of considerable importance for a \n     variety of recreational and commercial activities, and \n     provide a vital means of transportation.\n       (3) Ocean and coastal resources are limited and susceptible \n     to change as a direct and indirect result of human \n     activities, and such changes can impact the ability of the \n     ocean to provide the benefits upon which the Nation depends.\n       (4) Marine debris, including plastics, derelict fishing \n     gear, and a wide variety of other objects, has a harmful and \n     persistent effect on marine flora and fauna and can have \n     adverse impacts on human health.\n       (5) Marine debris is also a hazard to navigation, putting \n     mariners and rescuers, their vessels, and consequently the \n     marine environment at risk, and can cause economic loss due \n     to entanglement of vessel systems.\n       (6) Modern plastic materials persist for decades in the \n     marine environment and therefore pose the greatest potential \n     for long-term damage to the marine environment.\n       (7) Insufficient knowledge and data on the source, \n     movement, and effects of plastics and other marine debris in \n     marine ecosystems has hampered efforts to develop effective \n     approaches for addressing marine debris.\n       (8) Lack of resources, inadequate attention to this issue, \n     and poor coordination at the Federal level has undermined the \n     development and implementation of a Federal program to \n     address marine debris, both domestically and internationally.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to establish programs within the National Oceanic and \n     Atmospheric Administration and the United States Coast Guard \n     to help identify, determine sources of, assess, reduce, and \n     prevent marine debris and its adverse impacts on the marine \n     environment and navigation safety, in coordination with other \n     Federal and non-Federal entities;\n       (2) to re-establish the Inter-agency Marine Debris \n     Coordinating Committee to ensure a coordinated government \n     response across Federal agencies;\n       (3) to develop a Federal information clearinghouse to \n     enable researchers to study the sources, scale and impact of \n     marine debris more efficiently; and\n       (4) to take appropriate action in the international \n     community to prevent marine debris and reduce concentrations \n     of existing debris on a global scale.\n\n     SEC. 3. NOAA MARINE DEBRIS PREVENTION AND REMOVAL PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Establishment of Program.--There is established, within \n     the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, a Marine \n     Debris Prevention and Removal Program to reduce and prevent \n     the occurrence and adverse impacts of marine debris on the \n     marine environment and navigation safety.\n       (b) Program Components.--Through the Marine Debris \n     Prevention and Removal Program, the Administrator shall carry \n     out the following activities:\n       (1) Mapping, identification, impact assessment, removal, \n     and prevention.--The Administrator shall, in consultation \n     with relevant Federal agencies, undertake marine debris \n     mapping, identification, impact assessment, prevention, \n     and removal efforts, with a focus on marine debris posing \n     a threat to living marine resources (particularly \n     endangered or protected species) and navigation safety, \n     including--\n\n[[Page S1297]]\n\n       (A) the establishment of a process, building on existing \n     information sources maintained by Federal agencies such as \n     the Environmental Protection Agency and the Coast Guard, for \n     cataloguing and maintaining an inventory of marine debris and \n     its impacts found in the United States navigable waters and \n     the United States exclusive economic zone, including \n     location, material, size, age, and origin, and impacts on \n     habitat, living marine resources, human health, and \n     navigation safety;\n       (B) measures to identify the origin, location, and \n     projected movement of marine debris within the United States \n     navigable waters, the United States exclusive economic zone, \n     and the high seas, including the use of oceanographic, \n     atmospheric, satellite, and remote sensing data; and\n       (C) development and implementation of strategies, methods, \n     priorities, and a plan for preventing and removing marine \n     debris from United States navigable waters and within the \n     United States exclusive economic zone, including development \n     of local or regional protocols for removal of derelict \n     fishing gear.\n       (2) Reducing and preventing loss of gear.--The \n     Administrator shall improve efforts and actively seek to \n     prevent and reduce fishing gear losses, as well as to reduce \n     adverse impacts of such gear on living marine resources and \n     navigation safety, including--\n       (A) research and development of alternatives to gear posing \n     threats to the marine environment, and methods for marking \n     gear used in specific fisheries to enhance the tracking, \n     recovery, and identification of lost and discarded gear; and\n       (B) development of voluntary or mandatory measures to \n     reduce the loss and discard of fishing gear, and to aid its \n     recovery, such as incentive programs, reporting loss and \n     recovery of gear, observer programs, toll-free reporting \n     hotlines, computer-based notification forms, and providing \n     adequate and free disposal recepticals at ports.\n       (3) Outreach.--The Administrator shall undertake outreach \n     and education of the public and other stakeholders, such as \n     the fishing industry, fishing gear manufacturers, and other \n     marine-dependent industries, on sources of marine debris, \n     threats associated with marine debris and approaches to \n     identify, determine sources of, assess, reduce, and prevent \n     marine debris and its adverse impacts on the marine \n     environment and navigational safety. Including outreach and \n     education activities through public-private initiatives. The \n     Administrator shall coordinate outreach and education \n     activities under this paragraph with any outreach programs \n     conducted under section 2204 of the Marine Plastic Pollution \n     Research and Control Act of 1987 (33 U.S.C. 1915).\n       (c) Grants.--\n       (1) In general.--The Administrator shall provide financial \n     assistance, in the form of grants, through the Marine Debris \n     Prevention and Removal Program for projects to accomplish the \n     purposes of this Act.\n       (2) 50 percent matching requirement.--\n       (A) In general.--Except as provided in subparagraph (B), \n     Federal funds for any project under this section may not \n     exceed 50 percent of the total cost of such project.

A bill to amend the Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention \nand Control Act of 1990 to establish vessel ballast water management \nrequirements, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President. I rise today to introduce the Ballast \nWater Management Act of 2005. I am joined by my friend and colleague, \nSenator Ted Stevens. For some time we have recognized the impacts of \nland-based invasive species. In Hawaii, the impacts of such alien \nspecies on native species have been among the most significant in the \ncountry.\n  While not as visible, invasive species pose an equally great threat. \nOne of the major ways that aquatic invasives make their way around the \nglobe is through the ballast water used by vessels.\n  Modern maritime commerce depends on ships stabilized by the uptake \nand discharge of huge volumes of ocean water for ballast. Regrettably, \nships do not transport such water alone--but also the plants and \nanimals, as well as human diseases such as cholera, that it contains. \nAn estimated 10,000 aquatic organisms travel around the globe each day \nin the ballast water of cargo vessels. Over 2 billion gallons of \nballast water are discharged into waters of the United States each \nyear.\n  From the zebra mussel fouling the facilities and shores of the Great \nLakes, to the noxious algae that choke the coral reefs of Hawaii, \naquatic invasive species pose a serious threat to delicate marine \necosystems and human health. The economic costs are also staggering--\nthe direct and indirect costs of\n\n[[Page S1299]]\n\naquatic invasive species to the economy of the United States amount to \nbillions of dollars each year.\n  We must find an effective solution to this problem, while at the same \ntime ensuring that our maritime industry can continue to operate in a \ncost-effective manner. We will need to rely on the steady collaborative \nefforts of industry, science, government, and coastal communities as we \nmove forward.\n  The bill I introduce today lays the foundation for such progress. It \nestablishes standards for ballast water treatment that will be \neffective but on a schedule that our maritime fleet can realistically \nachieve. It recognizes safety as a paramount concern, and allows \nflexibility in ballast exchange practices to safeguard vessels and \ntheir passengers and crew. Looking to the future, my bill will also \nencourage the development and adoption of new ballast water treatment \ntechnologies, as well as innovative technologies to address other \nvessel sources of invasives such as hull fouling, through a grant \nprogram.\n  The bill closely tracks and is consistent with an agreement recently \nnegotiated in the International Maritime Organization. It would phase-\nin ballast water treatment requirements on the same schedule as that \nadopted by the IMO agreement, and require ballast water exchange to be \nused until treatment systems are in place. Importantly, the \ninternational agreement includes a provision assuring that parties can \nadopt more stringent measures than those included in the agreement. \nThis provision was sought by the United States and is important to \nassure the sovereignty of nations in addressing their needs while \nstriving for international cooperation. In light of this provision, the \nbill includes a standard for treatment that is more effective than that \nadopted by the international community to ensure that the impacts in \nthe United States are adequately prevented.\n  Finally, the bill would require a report on other vessel pathways of \ninvasive species, including hull fouling, and the development of \nstandards to reduce the introduction of invasive species through such \npathways. This issue is particularly important for Hawaii.\n  I hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting this bill. I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 363\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Ballast Water Management Act \n     of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The introduction of aquatic invasive species into the \n     Nation's waters is one of the most urgent issues facing the \n     marine environment in the United States.\n       (2) The direct and indirect costs of aquatic invasive \n     species to the economy of the United States amount to \n     billions of dollars per year.\n       (3) Invasive species are thought to have been involved in \n     70 percent of the last century's extinctions of native \n     aquatic species.\n       (4) Invasive aquatic species are a significant problem in \n     all regions of the United States, including Hawaii, Alaska, \n     San Francisco Bay, the Great Lakes, the Southeast, and the \n     Chesapeake Bay.\n       (5) Ballast water from ships is one of the largest pathways \n     for the introduction and spread of aquatic invasive species.\n       (6) It has been estimated that some 10,000 non-indigenous \n     aquatic organisms travel around the globe each day in the \n     ballast water of cargo ships.\n       (7) Over 2 billion gallons of ballast water are discharged \n     in United States waters each year. Ballast water may be the \n     source of the largest volume of foreign organisms released on \n     a daily basis into American ecosystems.\n       (8) Ballast water has been found to transport not only \n     invasive plants and animals but human diseases as well, such \n     as cholera.\n       (9) Invasive species may also be introduced by other vessel \n     conduits, including the hulls of ships.\n       (10) Invasive aquatic species may originate in other \n     countries, or from distinct regions in the United States.\n       (11) An average of 72 percent of all fish species \n     introduced in the Southeast have become established, many of \n     which are native to the United States but transplanted \n     outside their native ranges.\n       (12) The introduction of non-indigenous species has been \n     closely correlated with the disappearance of indigenous \n     species in Hawaii and other islands.\n       (13) Despite the efforts of more than 20 State, Federal, \n     and private agencies, unwanted alien pests are entering \n     Hawaii at an alarming rate----about 2 million times more \n     rapid than the natural rate.\n       (14) Current Federal programs are insufficient to \n     effectively address this growing problem.\n       (15) Preventing aquatic invasive species from being \n     introduced is the most cost-effective approach for addressing \n     this issue, because once established, they are costly and \n     sometimes impossible to control.\n\n     SEC. 3. BALLAST WATER MANAGEMENT.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 1101 of the Nonindigenous Aquatic \n     Nuisance Prevention and Control Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 4711) \n     is amended to read as follows:\n\n     ``SEC. 1101.

A bill to establish a program within the National Oceanic \nAtmospheric Administration to integrate Federal coastal and ocean \nmapping activities; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Ocean and \nCoastal Mapping Integration Act, and I am pleased to be joined by my \nCommerce Committee Chairman, Senator Stevens, and fellow Committee \nmembers Senators Lott, Cantwell, Snowe, Kerry, and Lautenberg, who are \nall original cosponsors of the bill. I am pleased to report that the \nSenate passed this bill unanimously in the 108th Congress, and we look \nforward to moving this legislation quickly this year, particularly \nbecause of its importance to coastal planning for natural hazards such \nas tsunami.\n  The jurisdiction of the United States extends 200 miles beyond its \ncoastline and includes the U.S. Territorial Sea and Exclusive Economic \nZone, or ``EEZ.'' Regrettably, nearly 90 percent of this expanse \nremains unmapped by modern technologies, meaning that we have almost no \ninformation about a swath of ocean as large as the terra firma of the \nentire United States.\n  There was a time in the history of our Nation when our best efforts \nto map the seas meant lowering weights tied to piano wire over the side \nof a vessel, and measuring how deep they went. These efforts led to the \ndevelopment of rudimentary nautical charts designed to help mariners \nnavigate safely. The rapidly increasing uses of our coastal and ocean \nwaters, however, call for development of a new generation of ecosystem-\noriented mapping and assessment products and services.\n  The technologies of today create richly layered mapping products that \nexpand far beyond just charting for safe navigation. Now, by combining \nsuch information as mineral surveys of the U.S. Geological Service, \nhabitat characterizations of the National Oceanic Atmospheric \nAdministration NOAA, and watershed assessments of the Environmental \nProtection Agency into a single product, map users are able to consider \nthe impacts of their actions on multiple facets of the marine \nenvironment.\n  Last year, the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy issued a report \nhighlighting the urgent need to modernize, improve, expand, and \nintegrate federal mapping efforts to improve navigation, safety and \nresource management decisionmaking. By employing integrated mapping \napproaches, urban and residential growth can be directed away from \nareas of high risk from ocean-based threats such as tsunami and tidal \nsurge. The risks of maritime activities can be minimized by identifying \nhazards that could impact on sensitive ecosystems, and devising \nappropriate mitigation plans. Living marine resource managers can also \ngauge where and how best to focus their efforts to restore essential \nmarine habitats.\n  The bill we are introducing today will lay the foundation for \nproducing the ocean maps of the 21st century. It mandates coordination \namong the many federal agencies with mapping missions with NOAA as the \nlead in developing national mapping priorities and strategies. The bill \nwould also establish national hydrographic centers to manage \ncomprehensively the mapping data produced by the federal government, \nencourage innovation in technologies, and authorize the funding \nnecessary to implement this comprehensive effort.\n  Perhaps the most important lesson that comprehensive, integrated \nmapping can afford is an awareness of a web of human marine communities \nas rich and varied as the ocean itself. From awareness grows \nunderstanding, respect, and cooperation.\n  I hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting this measure \nthat will, in turn, support the development of healthy coastal \ncommunities across the nation. I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthis bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 364\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S1304]]\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Torture Victims Relief Act of 1998 to \nauthorize appropriations to provide assistance for domestic and foreign \ncenters and programs for the treatment of victims of torture, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, torture is a fundamental violation of \nhuman rights. It is an act that aims not only to destroy the body but \nto destroy a person's spirit, leaving a psychologically crippled victim \nas a warning to others in their community.\n  Approximately 500,000 survivors of torture have found refuge in the \nUnited States, with many more around the world. The survivors of this \nterrible experience require treatment to recover from the effects of \ntorture and to rebuild their shattered lives.\n  Fortunately, we have the ability to provide such treatment. There are \n30 torture treatment centers in the United States located in 16 states, \nall helping former victims to recover from the trauma they experienced. \nWe in Minnesota are tremendously proud of the work of Minnesota's \nCenter for Victims of Torture, a world leader in administering this \nkind of treatment.\n  The Torture Victims Relief Reauthorization Act will authorize $92 \nmillion in funding for both domestic and foreign treatment centers for \nvictims of torture. $50 million of the funding goes directly to \ndomestic programs. The remaining funds assist foreign treatment centers \nthrough the U.S. Agency for International Development and the U.N. \nVoluntary Fund for Victims of Torture.\n  This reauthorization comes at a critical time. With the liberation of \nthe people of Iraq and Afghanistan and other events around the world, \neven more survivors of torture around the world are seeking treatment. \nI look forward to the prompt consideration of this legislation and urge \nmy colleagues to support this and other effort to assist victims of \ntorture.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 365\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide assistance to reduce teen pregnancy, HIV/\nAIDS, and other sexually transmitted diseases and to support healthy \nadolescent development; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Responsible \nEducation About Life or ``REAL'' Act along with my cosponsors Senators \nKennedy, and Mrs. Murray.\n  The REAL Act aims to reduce adolescent pregnancy, HIV rates, and \nother sexually transmitted diseases, by providing federal funds for \ncomprehensive sex education in schools. Comprehensive sex education is \nmedically accurate, age appropriate, education that includes \ninformation about both contraception and abstinence. It is an approach \nthat doesn't hide important information from our kids.\n  For years, taxpayer dollars have been flooded into unproven \n``abstinence-only'' programs--while no federal program is dedicated to \ncomprehensive sex education. Under the Bush Administration, federal \nsupport for ``abstinence-only'' education has expanded rapidly.\n  The proof is in the numbers. In fiscal year 2004 the federal \ngovernment spent $138 million dollars on ``abstinence only'' programs. \nIn fiscal year 2005 the federal government increased funding for these \nprograms by $30 million dollars. This year President Bush is asking for \n$206 million dollars for ``abstinence only'' education--a 50 percent \nincrease over the 2004 funding level. Would you like to know how much \nmoney has the government devoted to comprehensive sex education \nprograms over this same time? Zero dollars.\n  Much of the taxpayer funds going to ``abstinence-only'' programs are \nessentially being wasted. Teens need information, not censorship. \n``Abstinence-only'' education only tells young people half the story, \nand they need the full picture. These programs are not getting the job \ndone.\n\n[[Page S1306]]\n\n  After years of ``abstinence only'' programs, the United States still \nhas the--highest rates of teen pregnancy in the industrialized world. \nThe American public knows what works. Parents do not want sexual \neducation programs limited to abstinence in schools. Even the Heritage \nFoundation had to admit this when their own poll showed that ``75 \npercent of parents want teens to be taught about both abstinence and \ncontraception.'' Other polls show numbers as high as 93 percent in \nsupport of high school programs that include information about \ncontraception.\n  The REAL Act also has the support of the National Education \nAssociation (NEA), the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the \nAmerican Nurses Association (ANA), the Child Welfare League of America \nand more than 130 other medical and professional organizations. It is a \nfact that teenagers who receive sex education that includes discussion \nof contraception are more likely to delay sexual activity than those \nwho receive abstinence-only education. Comprehensive sex education \nsimply works better.\n  The stakes are high: of the 19 million cases of sexually transmitted \ndiseases every year in the United States, almost half of them strike \nyoung people between the ages of 15 and 24. And each year in the United \nStates, about 20,000 young people are newly infected with HIV.\n  These aren't just numbers. These are our sons and daughters whose \nhealth and well-being are jeopardized when ideology comes before sound \npublic policy. That is why we are introducing this legislation today. \nIt's time for a more balanced approach; it's time to protect out kids, \nand it's time to get REAL. Our bill authorizes $206 million per year in \nfederal funds to states for comprehensive sexual education programs.\n  The REAL Act is step in a more effective direction. It brings sex \neducation up-to-date in a way that will reflect the serious issues and \nreal life situations millions of young people find themselves in every \nyear. Young people have a right to accurate and complete information \nthat could protect their health and even save their lives. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the REAL Act and make it possible to give young \npeople the tools to make safe and responsible decisions. Mr. President, \nI ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 368\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Responsible Education About \n     Life Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) The American Medical Association (``AMA''), the \n     American Nurses Association (``ANA''), the American Academy \n     of Pediatrics (``AAP''), the American College of \n     Obstetricians and Gynecologists (``ACOG''), the American \n     Public Health Association (``APHA''), and the Society of \n     Adolescent Medicine (``SAM''), support responsible sexuality \n     education that includes information about both abstinence and \n     contraception.\n       (2) Recent scientific reports by the Institute of Medicine, \n     the American Medical Association and the Office on National \n     AIDS Policy stress the need for sexuality education that \n     includes messages about abstinence and provides young people \n     with information about contraception for the prevention of \n     teen pregnancy, HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted \n     diseases (``STDs'').\n       (3) Research shows that teenagers who receive sexuality \n     education that includes discussion of contraception are more \n     likely than those who receive abstinence-only messages to \n     delay sexual activity and to use contraceptives when they do \n     become sexually active.\n       (4) Comprehensive sexuality education programs respect the \n     diversity of values and beliefs represented in the community \n     and will complement and augment the sexuality education \n     children receive from their families.\n       (5) The median age of puberty is 13 years and the average \n     age of marriage is over 26 years old. American teens need \n     access to full, complete, and medically and factually \n     accurate information regarding sexuality, including \n     contraception, STD/HIV prevention, and abstinence.\n       (6) Although teen pregnancy rates are decreasing, there are \n     still between 750,000 and 850,000 teen pregnancies each year. \n     Between 75 and 90 percent of teen pregnancies among 15- to \n     19-year olds are unintended.\n       (7) Studies estimate that 50 to 75 percent of the reduction \n     in adolescent pregnancy rates is attributable to improved \n     contraceptive use; the remainder to increased abstinence.\n       (8) More than eight out of ten Americans believe that young \n     people should have information about abstinence and \n     protecting themselves from unplanned pregnancies and sexually \n     transmitted diseases.\n       (9) United States teens and young adults acquire an \n     estimated 4,000,000 sexually transmitted infections each \n     year. By age 25, at least 1 of every 2 sexually active people \n     will have contracted a sexually transmitted disease.\n       (10) More than 2 young people in the United States are \n     infected with HIV every hour of every day. African American \n     and Hispanic youth have been disproportionately affected by \n     the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Although about 15 percent of the \n     adolescent population (ages 13 to 19) in the United States is \n     African American, nearly 60 percent of AIDS cases through \n     2002 among 13- to 19-year olds were among African Americans. \n     Hispanics comprise nearly 16 percent of the adolescent \n     population (ages 13 to 19) in the United States and 22 \n     percent of reported adolescent AIDS cases through June 2002.\n\n     SEC. 3. ASSISTANCE TO REDUCE TEEN PREGNANCY, HIV/AIDS, AND \n                   OTHER SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES AND TO \n                   SUPPORT HEALTHY ADOLESCENT DEVELOPMENT.\n\n       (a) In General.--Each eligible State shall be entitled to \n     receive from the Secretary of Health and Human Services, for \n     each of the fiscal years 2006 through 2010, a grant to \n     conduct programs of family life education, including \n     education on both abstinence and contraception for the \n     prevention of teenage pregnancy and sexually transmitted \n     diseases, including HIV/AIDS.\n       (b) Requirements for Family Life Programs.--For purposes of \n     this Act, a program of family life education is a program \n     that--\n       (1) is age-appropriate and medically accurate;\n       (2) does not teach or promote religion;\n       (3) teaches that abstinence is the only sure way to avoid \n     pregnancy or sexually transmitted diseases;\n       (4) stresses the value of abstinence while not ignoring \n     those young people who have had or are having sexual \n     intercourse;\n       (5) provides information about the health benefits and side \n     effects of all contraceptives and barrier methods as a means \n     to prevent pregnancy;\n       (6) provides information about the health benefits and side \n     effects of all contraceptives and barrier methods as a means \n     to reduce the risk of contracting sexually transmitted \n     diseases, including HIV/AIDS;\n       (7) encourages family communication about sexuality between \n     parent and child;\n       (8) teaches young people the skills to make responsible \n     decisions about sexuality, including how to avoid unwanted \n     verbal, physical, and sexual advances and how not to make \n     unwanted verbal, physical, and sexual advances; and\n       (9) teaches young people how alcohol and drug use can \n     affect responsible decisionmaking.\n       (c) Additional Activities.--In carrying out a program of \n     family life education, a State may expend a grant under \n     subsection (a) to carry out educational and motivational \n     activities that help young people--\n       (1) gain knowledge about the physical, emotional, \n     biological, and hormonal changes of adolescence and \n     subsequent stages of human maturation;\n       (2) develop the knowledge and skills necessary to ensure \n     and protect their sexual and reproductive health from \n     unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted disease, \n     including HIV/AIDS throughout their lifespan;\n       (3) gain knowledge about the specific involvement of and \n     male responsibility in sexual decisionmaking;\n       (4) develop healthy attitudes and values about adolescent \n     growth and development, body image, gender roles, racial and \n     ethnic diversity, sexual orientation, and other subjects;\n       (5) develop and practice healthy life skills including \n     goal-setting, decisionmaking, negotiation, communication, and \n     stress management;\n       (6) promote self-esteem and positive interpersonal skills \n     focusing on relationship dynamics, including, but not limited \n     to, friendships, dating, romantic involvement, marriage and \n     family interactions; and\n       (7) prepare for the adult world by focusing on educational \n     and career success, including developing skills for \n     employment preparation, job seeking, independent living, \n     financial self-sufficiency, and workplace productivity.\n\n     SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that while States are not \n     required to provide matching funds, they are encouraged to do \n     so.\n\n     SEC. 5.

Res. 47\n\n       Whereas, over 450,000 members of the reserve components of \n     the Armed Force have been called to active duty between \n     September 11, 2001, and February of 2005, and have had to \n     leave their families and employers to serve and protect their \n     country;\n       Whereas, the reservists called to active duty provide \n     critical support of United States military operations abroad \n     by serving as engineers, medics, military police, and civil \n     affairs specialists, and in other military specialities;\n       Whereas, more than half of all reservists are married, and \n     about half of them have children or other dependents;\n       Whereas, extended active-duty service in the performance of \n     critical national security missions abroad has required \n     reservists to make significant sacrifices, in time spent away \n     from their family and, in some cases, loss of income;\n       Whereas, the business community in the United States has \n     played a crucial role in supporting our reservists by \n     providing significant financial assistance for reservists \n     ordinarily in their workforce who experience a reduction in \n     income due to extended active-duty service;\n       Whereas, this financial support by civilian employers makes \n     it possible, in many cases, for the families of reservists to \n     meet daily expenses associated with raising children and \n     attaining the American dream;\n       Whereas the business community continues to provide this \n     critical assistance so that the Nation's reservists may serve \n     their country without worrying about the financial condition \n     of their family; and\n       Whereas the following Indiana employers, among others, \n     provide assistance to their employees when, as reservists, \n     they are called to active duty, and the employers deserve \n     public recognition for their role in supporting our troops: \n     Eli Lilly and Company, Cummins, Inc., Guidant Corporation, \n     Alcoa, Inc., ConAgra Foods, Inc., CSX Corporation, Daimler \n     Chrysler, Delphi Technologies, Inc., The Dow Chemical \n     Company, FedEx Corporation, General Dynamics Corporation, \n     Raytheon Company, General Electric Company, American \n     International Group, Inc., Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, \n     Pfizer, Inc., United Parcel Service of America, Inc., Smiths \n     Group plc, Honeywell International, Inc., and Am General, \n     LLC: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the members of the reserve components of the Armed \n     Forces and the businesses that ordinarily employ them are a \n     cornerstone of the United States' successful prosecution of \n     the war on terror, and the Federal Government should take \n     steps to assist businesses that are providing this critical \n     support to the citizen-soldiers among their employees who are \n     away in the military service of the United States;\n       (2) the business community deserves the Nation's gratitude \n     for the role it continues to perform in supporting the \n     members of the reserve components of the Armed Forces, their \n     families, and this Nation; and\n       (3) the appropriate officials of the Federal Government \n     should carefully review the adverse effects of mobilizations \n     and demobilizations of the reserve components on the \n     community of employers within the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/10/senate-section/article/S1307-2", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1307-S1308]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 48--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING \n                         TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS\n\n  Mr. LUGAR submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                               S. Res. 48\n\n       Whereas an estimated 600,000 to 800,000 people are \n     trafficked annually;\n       Whereas approximately 70 percent of trafficked persons are \n     female and 50 percent are children;\n       Whereas approximately 250,000 people are trafficked in, \n     out, and through the South East Asia region each year;\n       Whereas the tsunami that struck South East Asia, South \n     Asia, and East Africa on December 26, 2004, killed more than \n     160,000 people, affected 5,000,000 people, and left an \n     estimated 35,000 children orphaned;\n       Whereas these orphaned children are particularly vulnerable \n     to being trafficked for sexual exploitation, forced labor, or \n     to be child soldiers;\n       Whereas governments of countries affected by the earthquake \n     and tsunami in the Indian Ocean have taken measures to \n     prevent the trafficking of children and other vulnerable \n     persons;\n       Whereas President Susilo Bambang Yudhyono of Indonesia has \n     ordered that immigration and police officers not allow \n     children from Aceh to be removed from the country;\n       Whereas Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi of Malaysia \n     undertook measures to prevent child trafficking by directing \n     immigration enforcement officials at entry points in Malaysia \n     to be on the alert for child trafficking and by imposing a \n     temporary ban on the adoption of foreign children;\n       Whereas, in India, the State Government of Tamil Nadu \n     opened shelters to protect orphaned or separated children and \n     pledged that it would provide orphans of the tsunami support \n     and education;\n       Whereas the Royal Thai Government has placed all tsunami \n     orphans in that country in the protective custody of extended \n     family members and has awarded boarding school scholarships \n     to children affected by the tsunami;\n       Whereas, in Sri Lanka, the National Child Protection \n     Authority (NCPA), UNICEF, and nongovernmental organizations \n     have mobilized teams to identify and register all children \n     who have been separated from their immediate families;\n       Whereas the United Nations Convention Against Transnational \n     Organized Crime (hereafter in this resolution referred to as \n     the ``Organized Crime Convention'') and the Protocol to \n     Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, \n     Especially Women and Children, a protocol to the Organized \n     Crime Convention (hereafter in this resolution referred to as \n     the ``Trafficking Protocol''), require countries to enact \n     laws to criminalize trafficking in persons, punish \n     traffickers, and assist victims;\n       Whereas the United States, on December 13, 2000, signed, \n     but has not yet ratified, the\n\n[[Page S1308]]\n\n     Organized Crime Convention and the Trafficking Protocol;\n       Whereas ratification by the United States of the Organized \n     Crime Convention and the Trafficking Protocol would enhance \n     the ability of the United States Government to render and \n     receive assistance on a global basis in the common struggle \n     to prevent, investigate, and prosecute trafficking in \n     persons; and\n       Whereas, like the United States, most countries affected by \n     the tsunami disaster have signed, but not yet ratified, the \n     Organized Crime Convention and the Trafficking Protocol: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) combating trafficking in persons should continue to be \n     a priority of United States foreign policy;\n       (2) the United States should ratify the United Nations \n     Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime and the \n     Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in \n     Persons, Especially Women and Children;\n       (3) the President should commend the efforts of the \n     governments of those countries affected by the December 26, \n     2004, tsunami to protect their children from the dangers of \n     trafficking; and\n       (4) the President should urge all countries to ratify the \n     United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organized \n     Crime and the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish \n     Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, \n     particularly those countries that have been most affected by \n     the tsunami and in which children face the resulting \n     increased risk of being abducted and trafficked.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise to submit a resolution expressing \nthe Sense of the Senate regarding the trafficking in children following \nthe Asian tsunami.\n  The recent tsunami in the Indian Ocean region was a natural disaster \nunlike anything in recent human history. It is estimated that the \ntsunami claimed the lives of more than 160,000 people throughout the \nregion and displaced more than 1 million.\n  This disaster has taken an incredible toll on children. The United \nNations Children Fund, UNICEF, estimates that children comprise more \nthan one-third of all deaths. Tens of thousands of children have lost \nfamily members and friends and are coping with unspeakable trauma. \nNearly 35,000 children have been orphaned, and many more have been \nseparated from their families. These children are in need of food, \nwater, and shelter. They face the imminent threats of hunger, disease, \nand diarrhea.\n  In addition to these dangers, these children are also vulnerable to \nbeing trafficked for sexual exploitation, forced labor, or to be child \nsoldiers. According to the Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in \nPersons at the Department of State, an estimated 600,000 to 800,000 \npeople are trafficked every year, some 50 percent of whom are children. \nIn South East Asia alone, nearly 250,000 people are trafficked in, out, \nand through the region. Without their families, the children orphaned \nby the tsunami lack protection from predators who would profit from \ntheir tragedy.\n  My resolution acknowledges this uniquely vulnerable group and urges \nthe United States and other countries to ratify the Protocol to \nPrevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women \nand Children and the underlying U.N. Convention Against Transnational \nOrganized Crime. The Protocol requires countries to enact laws to \ncriminalize trafficking in persons, punish traffickers and assist \nvictims. In addition, the Protocol would enhance our ability to give \nand receive assistance on a global basis in the common struggle to \nprevent, investigate and prosecute trafficking.\n  On December 13, 2000, the United States signed these international \nagreements. Last June, the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations held a \nhearing on these very important law enforcement treaties. At the \nearliest opportunity, I intend to schedule a vote on the Convention \nAgainst Transnational Organized Crime and the Protocol to Prevent, \nSuppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons at a business meeting of the \nCommittee. By ratifying the Trafficking Protocol, and urging other \ncountries to do the same, we would send a strong message to the world \nthat this modern-day form of slavery must be stopped and that the \nUnited States is committed to ensuring that perpetrators are punished \nand that victims are helped.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/10/senate-section/article/S1308-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1308]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n                      committee on armed services\n\n  Mr. HATCH.
