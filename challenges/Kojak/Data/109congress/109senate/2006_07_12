Mr. President, I rise this morning to address \nAmerica's ongoing efforts in Iraq and the larger war on terrorism.\n  Our Nation continues its steadfast resolve to bring security and \nprosperity to the Iraqi people, and President Bush is leading that \neffort with the help of this Congress and the American people.\n  Amidst press reports, which are generally not reflective of the most \nimportant things going on in Iraq, I want to review some recent \nsuccesses that highlight the progress we are making.\n  BG Kurt Cichowski, Deputy Chief of Staff for Strategy, Plans and \nAssessment of the Multi-National Force-Iraq, recently announced that \nthe Iraqi security forces will assume full control of the southern \nMuthanna. According to General Cichowski:\n\n       The transfer of security responsibility from U.S. forces to \n     the Iraqi security forces clearly demonstrates an Iraqi \n     success and signifies a tangible beginning to a new phase in \n     the history of this nation.\n\n  Muthanna is the first of Iraq's 18 provinces to be fully transferred \nfrom coalition to Iraqi security forces control. This latest move is a \nresult of\n\n[[Page S7362]]\n\njoint evaluation and collaboration between the provincial governor and \nthe coalition ground commander and clearly represents another turning \npoint in our efforts in Iraq.\n  Further, recent successes in joint raid operations dramatically \ndemonstrate the real progress we are making on the ground against the \ninsurgents. This past Friday, joint raids were conducted on a building \nwhich had been used as a base of operation by Abu Deraa, a top \ncommander of the Shiite militia. The Department of Defense reported the \nkilling or wounding of between 30 and 40 militia gunmen and the capture \nof a high-level militia commander. That same day, Iraqi police officers \ncaptured yet another top insurgent commander who is believed to have \nbeen involved in smuggling weapons, bankrolling terrorists, and \nlaunching attacks against American troops. This is the kind of progress \nwe are making on which, for whatever reason, the media chooses not to \nfocus.\n  Only yesterday, Iraqi Ambassador Khalilzad, addressing the Center for \nStrategic and International Relations here in Washington, spoke with \njustifiable pride and confidence concerning Iraq's future and its \nability to meet the challenges of governing a previously divided \nnation.\n  Let me quote liberally from some of what the Ambassador said:\n\n       Today, Sunni Arabs are full participants in the political \n     process, with their representation in the national assembly \n     now proportional to their share of the population . . . they \n     have largely come to see the United States as an honest \n     broker in helping Iraq's communities come together around a \n     process and a plan to stabilize the country.\n\n  He also noted that:\n\n       al Qaeda in Iraq has been significantly weakened during the \n     past year . . . which has coincided with the inauguration of \n     Iraq's first ever government of national unity . . . and the \n     recent announcement by Prime Minister Maliki of his \n     government's National Reconciliation and Dialogue Project.\n\n  The Ambassador also reported that:\n\n       [A] chasm has been developing between al Qaeda and those \n     Sunni Arabs in Iraq who have been part of the armed \n     opposition. Previously, many Sunni Arab insurgents saw al \n     Qaeda's operations as beneficial for their own cause. Now, \n     the Sunni Arabs increasingly understand that the terrorists \n     are not interested in the future of Iraq and that al Qaeda's \n     leaders see Iraqis as cannon fodder in an effort to instigate \n     a war of civilizations. More and more, Iraqi Sunni Arab \n     insurgents reject the cynical game. Osama bin Laden's \n     specific denunciation of Sunni Arab political leaders, such \n     as Vice President Tareg Hashami, and recently captured \n     documents indicate that al Qaeda's leadership knows that they \n     are losing ground as a result of Iraq's reconciliation \n     process. They know that if reconciliation goes further and \n     begins to hollow out the Sunni Arab armed opposition, it is a \n     mortal threat to their terrorist movement.\n\n  Let me say about Ambassador Khalilzad, having been to Iraq on four \noccasions myself, having met with the Ambassador each time I was there, \nplus having met with him previously when he was in Afghanistan, and on \nother occasions when he was here, this man is extremely well respected \nby the Iraqis. He is the right man in the right place to help improve \nAmerica's image and to continue the dialogue with the Iraqis to make \nsure that we move that country forward in a democratic process.\n  Some would have us ignore these successes or simply never hear of \nthem. Some would have us abandon these noble efforts and those of well \nover 100,000 service members working every day to bring about a \npeaceful Iraq. But the cost of doing so is too high, the consequences \ntoo horrible. We simply cannot permit the villainous hand of terrorism \nto strangle America's resolve and snuff out the coalition and Iraqi \nsuccesses which are bringing hope to the hopeless and victory to the \npreviously subjugated people of Iraq.\n  Iraq remains absolutely central to the war on terror. On June 7, \n2006, American and coalition forces dealt a powerful blow to the \nterrorists when they killed the leader of al-Qaida in Iraq, Abu Musab \nal-Zarqawi. The elimination of al-Zarqawi, who had claimed \nresponsibility for attacks on U.S. citizens since 2002, is a major \nvictory in our global war on terrorism as our counterterrorism forces, \ntogether with our intelligence community, demonstrated our tenacity, \nour capabilities, and our intent to winning this war on terror.\n  While we continue to identify, capture, and kill terrorists and \nprevent them from turning Iraq's fragile democracy into a lawless \ntraining ground from which they can launch attacks against our homeland \nand against their own peaceful citizens, we must not forget that this \nis, indeed, a global war on terrorism. Only yesterday did the world \nwitness a tragic terrorist event in the world's largest democracy, \nIndia, where seven nearly simultaneous bombings killed more than 100 \ninnocent people and injured hundreds more on the Mumbai commuter rail. \nThis heinous act of terrorism is sadly too familiar. It was just 1 year \nago that al-Qaida perpetrated the synchronized bombings in London, \nkilling over 50 people and wounding hundreds more.\n  Terrorists are still seeking to kill Americans with similar attacks \non our own soil. Just last week, we learned that the FBI, working \ntogether with their counterparts in Lebanon, arrested an individual in \na plot to detonate explosives in the Holland Tunnel in New York City. \nEarlier this month, the FBI arrested seven suspects of an al-Qaida-\ninspired group in Miami for their efforts to wage jihad against \nAmericans and for plotting to destroy the Sears Tower in Chicago, IL. \nEven in my home State of Georgia, alleged terrorists, again inspired by \nal-Qaida's violent ideology, in collaboration with their counterparts \nin Canada, Europe, and South Asia, were planning attacks in the United \nStates.\n  Despite these and other activities to attack our homeland, there has \nnot been a single terrorist attack on U.S. soil since September 11. \nThis is due to this administration's policy of taking the fight to the \nterrorists, denying them sanctuary in Afghanistan, Iraq, and elsewhere, \nworking closely with our foreign partners, and strengthening our \nNation's counterterrorism capabilities.\n  The world changed on September 11, 2001, demonstrating that it is \nvitally important that the President of the United States has the power \nand authority to protect the American people from future acts of \nterrorism. Programs such as the Terrorist Surveillance Program or the \nTerrorist Finance Tracking Program which, based on intelligence leads, \ncarefully targets terrorist communications or financial transactions, \nare essential tools in the war on terror. If there are people talking \nor communicating with terrorists, plotting against Americans, or \nsending money to help al-Qaida, then we need to know about it.\n\n  We know too well that terrorists are able to sneak into a country and \nhide among law-abiding citizens. Too often, we have witnessed the \nhorror they cause in places such as Iraq, Tel Aviv, Madrid, London, and \nunfortunately, in the United States. It is abundantly clear that these \ntypes of important programs are necessary to address the previous flaws \nin our early warning system that allowed at least two of the September \n11 murderers to live among us.\n  These vital programs make it more likely that terrorists will be \nidentified and located in time to prevent another disaster.\n  These efforts and capabilities are winning the war on terrorism and \nkeeping Americans safe. Unfortunately, unauthorized disclosures of some \nof these most sensitive investigations and programs are undermining our \nabilities and providing vital information to those killers who \ncontinuously seek to do us harm. The disclosure of our intelligence \noperations places our personnel, sources, and methods at risk. These \noperations are our first line of national security defense. The \nGovernment classifies information regarding our intelligence activities \nfor a reason. When terrorists know how we are tracking them, they \nchange the way they operate, making it harder to catch them. That makes \nthis Nation less safe.\n  Osama bin Laden was clear in his intent to continue to wage Jihad \nagainst America and peace-loving people worldwide when he said in his \nrecent videotaped message released on June 30, 2006:\n\n       We will continue to fight you and your allies everywhere, \n     in Iraq, Afghanistan, Somalia, and Sudan to run down your \n     resources and kill your men until you return defeated to your \n     Nation.\n\n  As bin Laden makes clear, al-Qaida is still seeking to kill Americans \nand innocent people worldwide, and they are spreading their message of \nhate and\n\n[[Page S7363]]\n\nmurder through the media and Internet. But America will not be \ndefeated. This is a war we cannot and will not lose. We must put an end \nto the unauthorized leaks of sensitive information that aids our \nenemies in their plans to kill Americans and avoid capture. We must \nalso continue to improve our counterterrorism efforts, finding new ways \nto disrupt enemy planning, eliminate terrorists from the battlefield, \nand strengthen collaboration within our intelligence, defense, and \nhomeland security organizations.\n  Our intelligence community, the Department of Defense, and law \nenforcement organizations across this Nation remain vigilant, and we \nowe our support and a debt of gratitude to these dedicated men and \nwomen who are on the front line of the global war on terror. We are \nindeed winning, but as it has been pointed out, this is a long war. The \nPresident is leading that effort with the help of this Congress, and \ntogether we are keeping Americans safe.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT Pro Tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/12/senate-section/article/S7363-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7363]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, yesterday a series of eight explosions \nstruck the heart of Mumbai, India, during the evening rush-hour \ncommute. At least 180 innocent civilians were killed and more than 700 \nwere injured in the blast.\n  On behalf of this Senate and the American people, I express my \nheartfelt condolences to the victims, to their families, and to the \nIndian people. We share in your grief and in your determination to hunt \ndown the criminals who carried out this despicable act. We will stand \nshoulder-to-shoulder with the Indian people and the Indian Government \nin order to bring the perpetrators of these attacks to justice.\n  Yesterday's bombings came less than a week after the 1-year \nanniversary of the London bombing attacks and less than a month after a \nthwarted terrorist plot against the New York City subway system was \nrevealed. These cowardly acts remind us again and again of our \nresponsibility to protect and secure the American homeland.\n  As we learned on 9/11, terrorists need to get it right just once. \nThey exploit whatever weaknesses they can find, deliberately targeting \nhard-working men and women on their way to work or back from work, \nschoolchildren on the way to their daily school activities, vacationers \non the way to the beach. In the face of such threats, we must be ever \nvigilant. Our pursuit must be determined. It must be tireless--breaking \nup terrorist cells, destroying their financing, chasing down the money \ntrail, and bringing each and every collaborator to justice. We have to \nstrengthen our weaknesses and we have to root out whatever \nvulnerabilities we have.\n  That is why the bill that is on the floor today, the Homeland \nSecurity bill, is so important. The Homeland Security spending bill \nprovides over $32 billion to strengthen our ports, America's ports, our \nborders, our transit systems. It provides financial support for 100 new \nrail inspectors and canine teams, enhancing our Nation's railway \nsecurity and ensuring that bombings such as those that happened in \nMumbai and London aren't repeated here.\n  It adds 1,000 more Border Patrol agents, investigators, and those \ndetention officers whom we know are so important in carrying out those \nresponsibilities of securing our borders. Coupled with the spring \nsupplemental, we will have added over 2,000 new agents in 1 year. That \nbrings the total to over 14,300 Border Patrol agents.\n  The bill also expands much needed detention space--places to put \npeople who illegally cross the border while justice is being \nadministered--with 1,000 new beds so that we can be sure people caught \nentering this country illegally are not released before their cases are \nproperly prosecuted. Taken with the spring supplemental, we will have \nadded over 5,000 beds along the border in 1 year, bringing the total \nnumber to over 25,300 beds.\n  The bill provides nearly $8.2 billion to the Coast Guard to protect \nthe 95,000 miles of shoreline border and to inspect both foreign and \ndomestic ports. It funds grants so that high-threat, high-density urban \nareas can strengthen their infrastructures against threat \nvulnerabilities. It supports our first responders so that our \nfirefighters, police officers, and paramedics have the training they \nneed should disaster strike. It provides more than $818 million to \ncombat weapons of mass destruction through appropriate research for \nbiological and chemical countermeasures as well as for the Domestic \nNuclear Detection Office to expand nuclear research and radiological \ndetection.\n\n  We have to use every single tool available to prevent further attacks \non American soil. That is why this bill is so important, the Homeland \nSecurity spending bill. It ensures that vital programs critical to our \nnational security have the funding they need to be an effective \ndefense.\n  Yesterday's bombings in Mumbai were part of a well-coordinated \nattack. We must pass the Homeland Security spending bill swiftly to \nensure that similar attacks are not repeated and especially are not \nrepeated on American soil.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, yesterday was a day where we did not \naccomplish much on the Senate floor. But we haven't accomplished much \nthe entire congressional session. We have 22 days left to do business \nuntil the adjournment date announced by the distinguished majority \nleader--22 days. We have so much to do and we have done so little.\n  It is not me, the Democratic leader, who is saying this is a do-\nnothing Congress. This is what all the pundits have written about. We \nhave wasted time on a political agenda.\n  What is a political agenda? We have spent days and days on an estate \ntax repeal that has no bearing on 99.8 percent of all the American \npeople. It affects less than two-tenths of 1 percent of all the people \nin America, but we have spent days of our time here on the Senate floor \ndealing with this issue.\n  Flag burning--it doesn't matter how you feel about flag burning. Is \nit the right thing to do, to take up precious days of the Senate time \non flag burning? In the little town where I was born and I still have \nmy home they are patriotic people. On the Fourth of July, I was there. \nThe flags were flying in that little town. But flag burning doesn't \nhave direct bearing to their lives.\n  The marriage amendment--I believe in the sanctity of marriage, but is \nit something we should spend time on with a constitutional amendment? \nDuring the time we have been a country, there have been more than \n11,000 attempts to amend the Constitution. In the last 12 years, we had \n1,000 amendments to the Constitution filed. One we have spent a lot of \ntime on, unnecessarily, is the marriage amendment. We have spent days \nof our time here in the Senate on this issue. The people in \nSearchlight, NV, would rather that we dealt with things that are \nimportant, not flag burning, not gay marriage, not the estate tax. With \nthe limited amount of time we have left, we, the minority, the \nDemocrats, believe we have to do some things and do them before the \nAugust recess--things that affect people in my little town, \nSearchlight, NV.\n  Stem cell legislation--it is difficult to watch, before your eyes, \nsomeone who deteriorates with Parkinson's disease. You can see it \nhappen. No matter\n\n[[Page S7364]]\n\nhow often they go to the physician, the ravages of that disease go \nforward. How many times does a little child have to be pricked with a \nneedle before the majority over here understands that we have to do \nsomething about Parkinson's disease, juvenile diabetes, adult-onset \ndiabetes? We have to do something about Lou Gehrig's disease, \nAlzheimer's, multiple sclerosis. These diseases have some bearing on \nwhat people are hoping for--that we will do here in the Senate.\n  I had the opportunity when I was home this past recess to visit \nDanielle DeLee, from Searchlight, NV. She is graduating from high \nschool this year. The reason I wanted to see this young lady is she is \ngoing to go to Yale next year--a girl from Searchlight. It is the first \ntime in the history of that little town that someone can go to Yale. \nThat is because she is a brilliant young lady. They saw when she was a \nlittle girl that she had academic talent which that little town \ncouldn't handle. This young lady, because she is so smart--do you know \nwhat she is going to study at Yale? Math. Math. From Searchlight, NV, \nshe is going to go to Yale and study math.\n  Because of her brilliance, she will be fine. There are scholarships \nthat will take care of her. But that is not the way it is with most \npeople. Most people are not as smart as Danielle DeLee, and they need \nhelp. But not with this Republican-dominated Congress. They have taken \naway, not added to, the ability to go to school. Tuition deductibility \nfrom parents' income tax is not available. A child's ability to go to \ncollege should not be dependent on the fact that they are a brilliant \nperson like Danielle or on how rich his or her parents are. The rest of \nus, people like me, who are average, should be able to go to college if \nwe get some student loans and work a little bit. But that is not the \nway it is. This Republican-dominated Congress, this do-nothing \nCongress, is preventing people from going to college.\n  In Searchlight, because Las Vegas is 60 miles away and Boulder City \nis 43 miles away, the one thing everybody in that town is concerned \nabout is gas prices. Frankly, if you listed in Searchlight what was \nimportant to them, where would flag burning be? Where would gay \nmarriage be? Where would estate tax repeal be? It is not in their \nvocabulary. But how much they pay for a gallon of gas--which, by the \nway, in Nevada is over $3 now. Gas prices in the last week have gone up \n11 cents a gallon. In Reno, they are even higher than in Las Vegas. \nPeople there care about gas prices.\n  They care about what is going on in Iraq. Today on the morning news I \nheard that the Comptroller General of the United States now says the \nwar is costing $3 billion a week. People care about that war. On the \nway back to Searchlight one night last week, I stopped in a \nrestaurant--Evans Grille in Boulder City--and a young man came up to me \nand said: It is nice to see you. I went to his son's funeral. He was a \nNavy SEAL. He was killed--21 years old, killed. He cares about the war \nand how long it is taking and what we are accomplishing there.\n  Maybe the fifth thing we want to deal with here before the August \nrecess is the Voting Rights Act renewal. Maybe people in Searchlight \ndon't care about that as much as they do about stem cell research, \ncollege affordability, gas prices, the war in Iraq, but if they really \nthought about it, the Voting Act's renewal would be important.\n  What people went through to have that law passed.\n  I just finished reading a wonderful book when I was home entitled \n``Water's Edge.'' To have the Voting Rights Act passed, of course, you \nhad the leadership of Dr. Martin Luther King, which was as strong a \nleadership as you will ever see. But we see his leadership. But what we \ntend to forget are the deaths--plural--such as Ms. Liuzzio from \nDetroit, a white woman who came down. She was so concerned that she \ntold her husband she wanted to come and her children. She came and \nparticipated in the Selma march. When it was all over, she was giving \nsome people a ride back to Selma from Montgomery. A Klu Klux person \nshoots her in the head and kills her. Pastor Reeb, who came from \nCalifornia to participate, walked away from the crowd and they bashed \nhim in the head. Another Klansman killed him.\n  These are just two examples of death and destruction--not hundreds of \npeople being beaten, dogs sicced on them, but thousands had been \nbeaten.\n  We want to renew this. We are having it held up here and held up in \nthe other body. The Democrats want these issues to go forward, and we \nwant it done before the August recess.\n  The distinguished assistant minority leader, Senator Durbin, and I, \nalong with Senator Schumer and Senator Stabenow, signed a letter to \nSenator Frist, saying after we finish homeland appropriations, let us \ndo the stem cell research. That is the least we can do.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, would the minority leader yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. REID. I would be happy to.\n  Mr. DURBIN. This is the Senate calendar which is published every day \nthat we are in session. This one is from Wednesday, July 12. Turn to \npage 22, H.R. 810, an act to amend the Public Health Service Act to \nprovide for human embryonic stem cell research. If I am not mistaken, I \nwould like to ask the minority leader--the stem cell research bill has \nbeen sitting on the Senate calendar, as passed by the House in a \nbipartisan way, for more than 1 year, as we meet today.\n  Mr. REID. For 13\\1/2\\ months.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the minority leader: Have the Democrats come \nforward and asked that this bill be scheduled for floor consideration \nand debate repeatedly during that 13-month period?\n  Mr. REID. I am sorry to reflect on what we have done. We have begged. \nI don't beg people for much of anything, but we have begged. I have \nbeen part of the begging in this body for the majority leader to move \nthis matter forward because people at home are crying for hope. That is \nall they have left when they are sick.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the minority leader: Does this stem cell research \nbill, H.R. 810, which passed the House in a bipartisan fashion, enjoy \nbipartisan support in the Senate? Does it have cosponsorship on both \nsides of the aisle? Is this strictly a Democratic issue?\n  Mr. REID. It is not a Democratic issue. We have had people of good \nwill work together on this. We have had Democrats with a lot of \nseniority, Republicans with a lot of seniority, and clear down to those \nwith little seniority, Democrats and Republicans, wanting to get this \ndone.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the minority leader, in the month of June, when we \nwasted 2 weeks on the floor of the Senate on a Constitutional amendment \nrelative to flag burning, gay marriage, and an effort to provide tax \nrelief for the wealthiest people in America relative to the estate tax, \ncould we have called up this bill, H.R. 810, if the Republican \nleadership of the Senate had wanted it? Could it have been brought to \nthe floor, debated, passed, and sent to the President in that period of \ntime?\n  Mr. REID. Absolutely. We have done everything we could, as I have \nmentioned, including begging to get this matter before the Senate.\n  I mentioned this yesterday, and I will repeat.\n  I went to church last Sunday. A man tapped me on the shoulder. I \nlooked behind me. He was in a wheelchair. I couldn't understand him at \nfirst because he doesn't speak well. He has advanced Parkinson's \ndisease. As we listened closely--H.R. 810, could we do something to get \nit passed?\n  Mr. DURBIN. When the minority leader was in Searchlight, NV, during \nthe Fourth of July recess, I was in the State of Illinois and traveled \nthousands of miles--from the city of Chicago, Rockford, southern \nIllinois, my roots down State, and town after town, not at one place \nnor at any one time did any single person come up to me and say: Let me \ntell you what I think about the flag burning amendment; or let me tell \nyou what I think about the gay marriage amendment; or can you do \nsomething to reduce the estate tax for wealthiest people in America?\n  Did the Senator from Nevada have a similar experience? Did he go to a \ntown meeting, as I have, and mention stem cell research without someone \ncoming up to him--if they didn't volunteer during a meeting, maybe \nthere is a little shyness--after the meeting and say: My daughter has \njuvenile diabetes? One lady told me she wakes her up twice\n\n[[Page S7365]]\n\nduring the night to test her blood. Another person comes to me and \nsays: My mother is in a nursing home with Alzheimer's. It has been \ngoing on for years. It is a burden on our family. Or into the \ncongressional district now represented by Congressman Lane Evans, my \nclosest friend in our delegation and a personal hero to me, a man \nsuffering from Parkinson's disease who now has to withdraw from public \nlife to fight this battle--aren't these the real-life stories of real-\nlife people who are not reflected in the agenda nor in the priorities \nof the Republican-led Senate?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the people whom we visit in Nevada and \nIllinois and other places who have these problems are not Democrats \nonly. They are Republicans. They are Independents. They want this \nSenate to do something to help us.\n\n  That is why I am so disappointed that we have been literally wasting \nour time on issues that have no relevance.\n  Remember the months and months we spent on that fictitious issue that \nwe should not have dealt with about uprooting the foundation of our \ncountry, to change the quality of the Senate, to make it a unicameral \nlegislature--so-called nuclear option--because they didn't get all the \njudges they wanted. They were willing to throw this Senate into \nsomething it had never been before. We spent all of that time, when we \ncould have been doing stem cell research legislation; we could have \nbeen doing something about gas prices and the other things we have \nspoken about.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me ask the minority leader one last \nquestion about stem cell research. Before we adjourned, Senator Frist, \nthe Republican leader, came to the floor and propounded a unanimous \nconsent request to bring up this bill, H.R. 810, and two other bills \nrelated to the issues. We agreed on a bipartisan basis.\n  I ask my friend and colleague from the State of Nevada, has the \nRepublican leader set this matter--this unanimous consent request for \nthe stem cell research--to come before the Senate? Has he set it for \nthe Senate calendar? Do we know if or when this is going to be called?\n  Mr. REID. Let me recount, briefly, the ups and downs--mostly downs--\nof this legislation. I can remember months ago when my friend, Dr. Bill \nFrist, majority header of the Senate, stood right there and stunned me \nand most of America by saying: I support H.R. 810, stem cell research. \nThat made me feel so good. I thought that we were going to see the end, \nwe are going to see the light at the end of the tunnel. But I am sorry \nto say nothing has happened since then.\n  We finally got a unanimous consent request before we had the Fourth \nof July recess. As the leader said, he would bring it up. And I \nunderstand he told the press on Monday he would be willing to do it \nsometime this work period. I hope that is the case.\n  But no, the answer is we do not have a time yet to debate this \nlegislation. It is not going to take a lot of time. It isn't a bill \nthat is going to take days and days. We have 12 hours of debate. We \ncould do it all in 1 day. I am willing to do it all in 1 day.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask another question of the minority \nleader. I would like to do something that is maybe unprecedented in the \nmodern history of the Senate. We might even meet on Monday. How about a \nFriday? How about giving 12 hours of our life on a Friday for the \nmillions of Americans who are desperate for this medical research to \nbring hope to their families and their children. It would be \nunprecedented, would it not--I ask the minority leader from Nevada--for \nus to actually say: All right. This is so important that we will take \n12 hours on a Friday or 12 hours on a Saturday. How about that? The \nSenate would actually meet for 12 hours straight on Saturday and send \nthis bill to the President, if we could muster the 60 votes on a \nbipartisan basis. I can't speak for our caucus, but I am prepared to \nstay. Pick the day. Let us take the 12 hours, let us meet at 9 o'clock \nin the morning and stay until 9 o'clock at night and get it finished.\n  Would the leader from Nevada believe that to be a radical suggestion?\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Illinois and I came to Washington \ntogether. We were so proud. In 1982, we finally made it to Washington, \nDC.\n  The Senator mentioned Lane Evans. He was with us. It was a big class. \nIn the House of Representatives in those days, with Tip O'Neill and Jim \nWright, we worked nights, Fridays, Mondays, Saturdays in the House of \nRepresentatives. Now basically they have a 2-day workweek. In the \nSenate, we work 3 days. I realize we have just a few days left before \nthe August recess. The House, in fact, is adjourning about a week \nbefore we do. They have 2 more weeks. We have 3 more weeks after this \nweek. But it so good for the country if we could do something about \nstem cell research and finish that. If we could get the Voting Rights \nAct before us and have a real debate on what is going on in Iraq, we \nmight be able to get that done with the Defense appropriations bill. We \nknow the law of the land now. The law, as we speak, is that the year of \n2006 will be a year of significant transition in Iraq. Everyone in \nAmerica knows about that, except the President. He is staying the \ncourse. We are spending $3 billion a week now.\n  I hope we can take a look at gas prices.\n  The Senator is absolutely right. We need to roll up our sleeves and \nget this work done. I don't want to be a part of a do-nothing Congress. \nBut I have to say to my friend that at this stage this is a do-nothing \nCongress. Harry Truman, who invented the term, as far as I know, is \nlooking down from someplace and saying: Look, you got me beat.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the purpose of the two of us coming to the \nfloor today is to make it clear that we want this month of August to be \na month of significant transition in the Senate; to move us from a do-\nnothing Senate to actually take up issues that people across America \ncare about.\n  We wrote a letter to Senator Frist which said schedule stem cell \nresearch and give us a date certain to let us move forward. As the \nSenator said, let us move forward on this debate on Iraq. Let us move \nforward on help paying college tuition costs, particularly for working \nfamilies. Let's do something about energy costs and gasoline prices. \nAll of these things I think fit into an agenda that is timely and \nimportant for the American people.\n  I ask the Senator from Nevada the following question: Did he notice \nthis morning on the front page of the Washington Post that the chief of \npolice in the District of Columbia noted that since July 1 there have \nbeen 13 murders in our capital city? And in that period of time, 12 \ndays, 13 murders have created such a stir and concern that he has \ndeclared it is a time of criminal emergency in the Nation's capital \nbecause of the murder rate.\n  I ask the Senator from Nevada if he is aware of the fact that in the \nlast 3 days in the capital of Iraq, in Baghdad, 100 people have been \nmurdered in 3 days? Is he aware of the fact that just a few months ago, \nformer Iraq Prime Minister Ayad Allawi said: If this is not civil war, \nthen God knows what is.\n\n  I ask the Senator from Nevada, are we going to see the end of the \nSenate debate on Iraq come down to cut-and-run versus stay-the-course? \nIs that as good as it gets in the Senate, the most deliberative body in \nour Government? Is that the end of the conversation on Iraq for this \nyear as far as our agenda is concerned?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I certainly hope not. This is an intractable \nwar. We have seen the valor of our fighting forces. We have the finest \nmilitary in the history of the world. They have shown that in Iraq, \nfighting in situations that have never been fought in before, not in \nthe deserts of Iraq but in the cities, the slums, where snipers exist, \nwhere bombs are.\n  We need to have the President do what we tried to do when we offered \nan amendment on the Defense authorization bill to say that the year \n2006 is a year of significant transition, that is the law of the land. \nLet's start redeploying our troops by the end of the year. We need to \ndo that.\n  I say to my friend, changing the subject a little bit because we all \nneed good news, here is some good news: I indicated that Dr. Bill Frist \nstepped forward when he said he would support stem cell research. It \nwas a big day for our country, to have a prominent transplant surgeon, \nsomeone who is imminently qualified in the medical field. Now his \nlegislative valor on this issue, even though it is not as quick as I \nwould like, has come to the forefront.\n\n[[Page S7366]]\n\n  I just received a press release from the leader's office, majority \nleader Bill Frist's office. This is something we need to celebrate. \nThis is from Senator Bill Frist:\n\n       The Senate will take up the three stem cell bills on \n     Monday, July 17, and will complete all action by Tuesday, \n     July 18. There's tremendous promise in stem cell research . . \n     .\n\n  That is really good news. I compliment and applaud the majority \nleader for allowing next week to go to stem cell research. To those \npeople watching in America, it is good news. These people who have been \nhopeful--like the man who tapped me on the shoulder in church--we are \ngoing to do everything we can to get the 60 votes necessary to get this \nsent to the President's desk.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator from Nevada will yield, I address the \ncomment and question to him.\n  Despite the fact we have been pushing for a year, even speaking to \nthis issue in the Senate today, sending a letter to Senator Frist \ntomorrow, I thank him and congratulate Senator Frist. This is a \nbipartisan bill. It is critically important to our Nation to move \nforward on stem cell medical research.\n  When President Bush closed down this promising area of medical \nresearch almost 5 years ago, we left a void in terms of opportunity for \nfinding cures for critical diseases.\n  It has never been a partisan issue. Former First Lady Nancy Reagan \nhas pushed for stem cell research. Senator Orrin Hatch, Senator Arlen \nSpecter--there have been so many who have stepped forward asking for \nstem cell research. In the spirit of this announcement from Senator \nFrist, I hope we can move forward in a bipartisan fashion, pass the key \nbill, H.R. 810, by July 18, and send it to President Bush. I hope he \nwill reconsider his promised veto of this bill.\n  I ask, if I might, of the Senator from Nevada, when it comes to the \nVoting Rights Act, another issue which the Senator raised, the Senator \nand I are from a common generation that recalls the civil rights \nstruggle we lived through as we went through school and watched it \nunfold in America. The Voting Rights Act was passed to protect the \nrights of minorities to vote across the United States.\n  I ask the Senator from Nevada whether he is aware of a comment made \nby Jack Kemp, the former Republican Vice Presidential nominee, a former \nRepublican Member of Congress, when speaking of the House Republicans' \nefforts to stop reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act--this has been \noccurring over the last few weeks--that former Vice Presidential \nnominee Jack Kemp said that his Republican Party had better get this \nthing passed; we need to get back on the right side of history.\n  I ask the Senator from Nevada, has this not been a bipartisan issue, \nthe Voting Rights Act, where both parties tried to be on the right side \nof history in moving toward more opportunity and striking down \ndiscrimination when it came to voting in elections in America?\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Illinois and I served in the House with \nJack Kemp. Jack Kemp was an all-star: a great quarterback in college, a \ngreat quarterback in the professional ranks, and a very good Member of \nCongress. He speaks the truth.\n  The Republicans need to get on the right side of history. Holding \nthis up is not good for them. It is not good for our country.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator from Nevada in closing, there are \nMembers in the Senate, and we are moving to the Homeland Security bill. \nThat is a timely bill. I am glad we are considering it.\n  At another time, we will address the issue of increased cost of \ncollege education for working families and the failure of the \nRepublican leadership to schedule opportunities for tax deductions and \nreductions in student loan costs for these students.\n  Of course, the energy issue is the issue I ran into all across \nIllinois. We have seen a doubling of gasoline prices under the Bush \nadministration, there is a severe hardship on families and businesses, \nand still we have no energy policy to address this issue from this \nRepublican-dominated Congress.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/12/senate-section/article/S7366-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7366]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  STEM CELLS AND THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I make a couple of points based on what we \njust heard.\n  The first has to do with stem cells. As the Presiding Officer knows, \nI am a practicing physician. I am still delivering babies on weekends \nand our breaks. I am concerned in our country because we are letting \nemotional issues far override what the science today says on stem \ncells.\n  We have a lot of people who have significant diseases who have been \nconvinced that the only way those diseases will ever be solved is to \nuse embryonic stem cells. The dishonesty in the debate is concerning to \nme as a physician because the real breakthroughs have not been with \nembryonic stem cells.\n  There are now 70 treatments being utilized every day in this country \nfrom stem cells derived from core blood and adult blood stem cells. \nThere also is wonderful new research in the last year that says you can \ngain exactly the same pluripotent--a cell that will do anything--from \ngerm cells, from altered nuclear transfer, from three different \nmechanisms to get the exact same ability to cure diseases and never \ndestroy the first embryo.\n  We do not hear that in the debate. We do not hear the truth of what \nthe science is showing us, and we do not recognize that even though the \nFederal Government is funding, in a limited amount, embryonic stem cell \nresearch, the fact is, where the private money is going--it is not \ngoing to embryonic stem cell research, it is going to other pluripotent \nstem cell research that doesn't have anything to do with embryos.\n  This debate, as a physician and as a scientist, concerns me because \nit is not based on facts or on truth. For us to continue to belie the \nfact of what the science is showing us today creates a false impression \nbased on politics and false hope. There is great hope for people with \ndiabetes, there is great hope for people who have neurologic injury, \nbut it is not coming from embryonic stem cell research; it is coming \nfrom pluripotent stem cell research outside of that. During the debate \nnext week, I plan on making that point. I am going to counter every \npoint that belies science and does not recognize the true facts out \nthere today.\n  The final comment I will make is that the Voting Rights Act does not \nexpire for a year and a half. We ought to get it right. We ought to \nmake sure everyone is protected in this country in terms of the right \nto access. To say we have to do that right now, even though we are \nprobably going to do it, to claim that we do not want to do it is a \nfalse claim. No. 2, we have plenty of time to do it even if we do not \nget it done this year. Those are important things for the American \npublic to know and be aware of. No one in this Senate thinks we should \nnot reauthorize the Voting Rights Act. But we ought to do it in a way \nthat represents the principles on which this country is founded and not \nthe politics of the next election.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/12/senate-section/article/S7366-2", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7366]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide financial aid to local law enforcement officials \n          along the Nation's borders, and for other purposes)\n\n       On page 127, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following:\n\n              TITLE VI--BORDER LAW ENFORCEMENT RELIEF ACT\n\n     SEC. 601. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Border Law Enforcement \n     Relief Act of 2006''\n\n     SEC. 602. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) It is the obligation of the Federal Government of the \n     United States to adequately secure the Nation's borders and \n     prevent the flow of undocumented persons and illegal drugs \n     into the United States.\n       (2) Despite the fact that the United States Border Patrol \n     apprehends over 1,000,000 people each year trying to \n     illegally enter the United States, according to the \n     Congressional Research Service, the net growth in the number \n     of unauthorized aliens has increased by approximately 500,000 \n     each year. The Southwest border accounts for approximately 94 \n     percent of all migrant apprehensions each year. Currently, \n     there are an estimated 11,000,000 unauthorized aliens in the \n     United States.\n       (3) The border region is also a major corridor for the \n     shipment of drugs. According to the El Paso Intelligence \n     Center, 65 percent of the narcotics that are sold in the \n     markets of the United States enter the country through the \n     Southwest Border.\n       (4) Border communities continue to incur significant costs \n     due to the lack of adequate border security. A 2001 study by \n     the United States-Mexico Border Counties Coalition found that \n     law enforcement and criminal justice expenses associated with \n     illegal immigration exceed $89,000,000 annually for the \n     Southwest border counties.\n       (5) In August 2005, the States of New Mexico and Arizona \n     declared states of emergency in order to provide local law \n     enforcement immediate assistance in addressing criminal \n     activity along the Southwest border.\n       (6) While the Federal Government provides States and \n     localities assistance in covering costs related to the \n     detention of certain criminal aliens and the prosecution of \n     Federal drug cases, local law enforcement along the border \n     are provided no assistance in covering such expenses and must \n     use their limited resources to combat drug trafficking, human \n     smuggling, kidnappings, the destruction of private property, \n     and other border-related crimes.\n       (7) The United States shares 5,525 miles of border with \n     Canada and 1,989 miles with Mexico. Many of the local law \n     enforcement agencies located along the border are small, \n     rural departments charged with patrolling large areas of \n     land. Counties along the Southwest United States-Mexico \n     border are some of the poorest in the country and lack the \n     financial resources to cover the additional costs associated \n     with illegal immigration, drug trafficking, and other border-\n     related crimes.\n       (8) Federal assistance is required to help local law \n     enforcement operating along the border address the unique \n     challenges that arise as a result of their proximity to an \n     international border and the lack of overall border security \n     in the region\n\n     SEC. 603.

ENFORCEMENT OF FEDERAL IMMIGRATION LAW.\n\n       Nothing in this title shall be construed to authorize State \n     or local law enforcement agencies or their officers to \n     exercise Federal immigration law enforcement authority.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this amendment is the Border Law \nEnforcement Relief Act which I have introduced before, along with \nSenators Domenici, Cornyn, and Hutchison. I offer this amendment on \nbehalf of all of us again. It provides local law enforcement agencies \nin border communities with much-needed assistance in combatting border-\nrelated criminal activity.\n  During the debate on the immigration bill, this same legislation was \nproposed and agreed to by the Senate with a vote of 84 in favor and 6 \nagainst.\n  For far too long, law enforcement agencies that operate along the \nborder have had to incur significant costs due\n\n[[Page S7368]]\n\nto the inability of the Federal Government to secure our Nation's \nborders. It is time the Federal Government recognize that border \ncommunities should not have to bear that burden alone.\n  Specifically, the amendment establishes a competitive grant program \nwithin the Department of Homeland Security to help local law \nenforcement agencies that are situated along the borders cover some of \nthe costs they incur as a result of dealing with illegal immigration, \ndrug trafficking, stolen vehicles, and other border-related crimes.\n  The amendment authorizes $50 million a year and enables law \nenforcement within 100 miles of the border to hire additional \npersonnel, to obtain necessary equipment, and to cover the cost of \novertime and transportation costs. Law enforcement outside of this \ngeographic limit, this 100-mile limit, would be eligible if the \nSecretary of Homeland Security certified they were located in what we \ndesignate as a ``high impact area.''\n  The United States shares 5,525 miles of border with Canada and 1,989 \nmiles of border with Mexico. Many of the local law enforcement agencies \nthat are located along the border are small. They are rural departments \ncharged with patrolling large areas of land with few officers and with \nvery limited resources. According to a 2001 study of the U.S.-Mexico \nBorder Counties Coalition, criminal justice costs associated with \nillegal immigration exceed $89 million every year. Counties along the \nsouthwest border are some of the poorest in the country and are not in \na good position to cover these additional costs.\n\n  The States of Arizona and New Mexico have declared states of \nemergency in order to provide local law enforcement with immediate \nassistance in addressing criminal activity along the border. It is \ntime, in my view, that the Federal Government step up and share some of \nthat burden. So I urge my colleagues to support this important measure \nand to give law enforcement the resources they need to meet these \nchallenges.\n  Mr. President, I met last week with sheriffs and local police chiefs \nin communities along the southern New Mexico border with Mexico and \ntalked to them about the challenges they face and the need for \nadditional personnel, the need for modern equipment. Clearly, they are \nfaced with a very significant challenge because of the increased \nillegal activity going on along our U.S.-Mexico border. The assistance \nprovided in this amendment is assistance that would be very important \nto them in carrying out their responsibilities to the citizens of those \ncommunities.\n  So I urge my colleagues again to support this amendment. I am \ninformed this is an amendment the chairman has indicated might be \nacceptable. I am hoping we can have a vote, but I will at this point \nyield the floor until my colleague who is managing the bill can respond \nto the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I object for just a minute. My \nunderstanding is we were going to dispose of my amendment before we--\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I withdraw my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I apologize.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator's amendment \nbe agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4591) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4562\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, if there is a pending amendment, I ask \nunanimous consent it be set aside, and I call up amendment No. 4562.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4562.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To require that any limitation, directive, or earmarking \n   contained in either the House of Representatives or Senate report \n accompanying this bill be included in the conference report or joint \n  statement accompanying the bill in order to be considered as having \n               been approved by both Houses of Congress)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. Any limitation, directive, or earmarking contained \n     in either the House of Representatives or Senate report \n     accompanying H.R. 5441 shall also be included in the \n     conference report or joint statement accompanying H.R. 5441 \n     in order to be considered as having been approved by both \n     Houses of Congress.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, this is an amendment we have had several \ntimes on appropriations bills. It is about sunshine, pure and simple. \nWhat most Americans do not realize is that when conference reports come \non appropriations bills, there are things that are added in the House \nthat we in the Senate do not have any idea of what they are. They are \nnot printed except in the report language. When we vote on the bill, we \nhave no awareness whatsoever of what those things are.\n  This is a fairly simple amendment that just ensures that every \nearmark or directive must be included in the final Homeland Security \nappropriations bill that is approved by both Chambers. The American \npeople ought to get to see that, and we ought to be able to know, as \nSenators, what is in the bill.\n  This amendment is for transparency. It adds to the debate, and it \nprovides the American taxpayers an additional safeguard that their \nmoney is not wasted on unnecessary projects that might jeopardize the \nNation's fiscal health or lessen the impact of the Homeland Security \nbill.\n  The first time I offered this amendment, it was defeated. The second \ntime I offered it, last year, we won it, and the third time we won it \non separate appropriations bills. Thereafter, it was agreed to. That is \nall good and fine. But after it was done on every appropriations bill, \nit was dropped in conference, saying: We don't need to know what we are \nvoting on. We don't need to have the information that we are having. \nThe American people shouldn't know what we are voting on, and we \nshouldn't know what we are voting on.\n  I believe this is something that we ought to put into every \nappropriations bill. We ought to know what we are voting on. We ought \nto know who is responsible for what is in there. And we ought to be \nable to go home and defend it or object to it here on the floor. But \nnobody can make a case for us not knowing what is in the bill.\n  So my hope would be that the secrecy of the appropriations process or \nthe sleight of hand in how things are written, so nobody can know where \nit is going or who put it there, would be eliminated. All this is is a \nsunshine amendment saying: We ought to know. My hope is we will accept \nthis amendment, one, and then we will keep it in in conference so that \nwhen a conference bill comes back out, we can know what the House did \non earmarks and directives, as well as knowing what we did.\n  I think it is a commonsense amendment. My hope would be the chairman \nand ranking member of this committee would accept this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I appreciate the efforts of the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma in the area of making sure the taxpayers know where their \nmoney is being spent. I think it has been constructive, and I will be \nhappy to accept the amendment. But I do believe that at least relative \nto this appropriations bill there ought to be some recognition of the \nfact that this is probably the cleanest bill brought to the Senate in \nthe history of the Senate relative to what would be deemed earmarks in \nthe pejorative sense.\n  I am not one of these people who subscribes to the view that the \nCongress should not earmark. I happen to believe there are a lot of \ninstances where the congressional prerogative of spending the money \nrequires that we do earmark in order to make the case against the \nexecutive branch, which can earmark unilaterally, and basically in\n\n[[Page S7369]]\n\ntrue secrecy, by simply spending the money however they want to spend \nit once we give it to them. Often their direction is incorrect, and the \npurpose of the Congress should be to redirect it.\n  Now, there are other earmarks, particularly like the famous ``bridge \nto nowhere,'' and other things, that may and do have serious issues. I \nwould take the entire highway bill that passed the Senate--of which I \nwas one of four people who voted against it, which had $24 billion of \nearmarks--as the most egregious example of when Congress got carried \naway with directing money inappropriately.\n  But there is a purpose for earmarks. And this bill is a classic \nexample of that, quite honestly. The amendment, for example, that was \noffered yesterday by the Senator from West Virginia could be deemed an \nearmark amendment, I suppose, because he said specifically: Coast \nGuard, you shall purchase this plane; Customs, you shall refurbish this \nplane. You shall buy armament for these Coast Guard helicopters--all of \nwhich benefited some district in this country. And some Member of the \nSenate benefited from that by putting out a press release, I suspect, \nthat we just bought an airplane for the Coast Guard, and it is going to \nbe produced in someplace or other.\n  But the reason we had to do that was because the administration had \nnot sent up the necessary capital improvements to make sure the Coast \nGuard had the aircraft, to make sure they had the armament on their \nhelicopters, to make sure the helicopters were replaced, to make sure \nthe vehicles were replaced because, for whatever reason, the Department \nof Homeland Security had not determined that those were priorities. We \nthink they are priorities.\n  In this bill there are no, what you would call, district earmarks to \nspeak of. There are a few probably in there somewhere, but nothing of \nany significance compared to what the average bill that comes through \nthis place has. I do believe when we do our job right--which is the way \nI think this bill was done--when we do not use earmarks for the \npurposes of basically addressing an individual need that is maybe not \nwithin the context of the basic goal of the agency--although many \nthings are that are deemed earmarks, that we rather use the earmark \nstructure as a way of getting agencies to do what has to be done in \norder to complete their missions appropriately--that we should get \ncredit for that.\n  This bill should be acknowledged as a bill that is a pretty good \nexample of how this should be done right. So I appreciate the vigilance \nof the Senator from Oklahoma. He has become the watchdog of earmarks. \nAnd he is doing the Lord's work in many ways. I am perfectly happy to \nhave sunshine on this bill because I think this bill is a classic \nexample of the way it should be done.\n  So has the amendment been reported, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent it be agreed to.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object for one \nmoment, I want to make a point. The example used of the Senator from \nWest Virginia is exactly the way it ought to be done. It is out in the \nopen. There is direction. His name is tied to an amendment. And \neverybody in America who is watching this place knows who is doing what \nthey are doing.\n  This amendment is to make sure that happens. The point is not what we \nare doing. This amendment is as to what the House is doing. And I would \nconfirm with the Senator, the chairman, that this is a great bill in \nterms of earmarks. There are very few in it. We study every bill to see \nwhere it is and what the direction is. My hope is that an example will \nbe set. There are a couple of earmarks, directives in this bill we will \nbe talking about in amendments, but I will tell the Senator that I \nagree and I appreciate the fact that we are seeing a little bit of a \nchange in culture in that regard.\n  My hope would be, also--I might ask the Senator--if he would agree to \nhold this in conference so we can see what the House does when we come \nto the conference report.\n  With that, I withdraw my objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I renew my unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4562) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GREGG. In response to the Senator's request that I hold this in \nconference, I have no problem in trying to hold this in conference. As \nthe Senator knows, the House has a different approach to some of these \nissues. But I think this is a very reasonable request. People should \ntie their names to what they are willing to spend taxpayer dollars on. \nIt should be public, as the Senator said. That is the way we should do \nit. I am perfectly happy to support that aggressively.\n  Mr. COBURN. I appreciate that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4561\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside and that amendment No. 4561 be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4561.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To require that reports required in the bill to be submitted \n  to the Committees on Appropriations and the Department of Homeland \n  Security's annual justifications of the President's budget request \nshall be posted on the Department of Homeland Security's public website \nnot later than 48 hours after such submission unless information in the \n                 report compromises national security)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. Any reports required in this Act and accompanying \n     reports to be submitted to the Committees on Appropriations \n     and the Department of Homeland Security's annual \n     justifications of the President's budget request shall be \n     posted on the Department of Homeland Security's public \n     website not later than 48 hours after such submission unless \n     information in the report compromises national security.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, this requires public disclosure of all \nreports delivered to the Appropriations Committee, including the \nPresident's justification on his budget, with the exception of national \nsecurity issues by the Department of Homeland Security, so that \neverybody can see what the request is, what the justification for the \nrequest is, and what the reports are.\n  Unfortunately, in this bill, there is a section that requires the \nopposite. There is a directive that says they are not to release it to \nthe American public, that they are only to release it to the \nAppropriations Committee. A little bit of experience: This year, when \nthe President's budget request came up, and the justifications for it, \nas a U.S. Senator it was unavailable to me. It was unavailable to my \nstaff. It was unavailable to any staff except Appropriations staff. \nThey do a good job. But as to the justifications for the request, just \nlike the Senator from New Hampshire said--we have the right of the \npurse strings. The House and the Senate have the right to say where the \nmoney goes. If we cannot have the justifications for why the \nPresident's budget is so numbered and divided, then we will not have \nthe ability to defend that--and that is those people outside of the \nAppropriations Committee.\n  In the committee report is this sentence:\n\n       The committee is deeply disappointed in the actions taken \n     by the Department to combine the reporting requirements of \n     this committee with other reports and then releasing the \n     results of those reports publicly prior to submission to the \n     committee. Reports to the committee are not expected to be \n     turned into publicity events again in the future.\n\n  Well, whose business is this? It is the American people's business; \nit is not just the Appropriations Committee's business. And it is the \nother Senators' business. And it is the other Congressmen's business. \nIt is not just one committee's business. They have the authority and \nthe obligation to bring it to the floor, but the knowledge of what the \nPresident requests and the knowledge of the reports required by bills \nthat we all vote on coming back to the Congress should be shared with \nthe American people.\n\n[[Page S7370]]\n\n  All this amendment says is that 48 hours after they report it to the \ncommittee--and they should get it first; I adamantly agree they should \nsee those reports first, since they are the ones who asked for them--it \nbecomes on line and available to the rest of the Senators, the rest of \nthe Congressmen, and, beyond that, the rest of the American people.\n  Why should they not see the President's budgetary request?\n  As a matter of fact, Josh Bolton, before becoming Chief of Staff for \nthe President, was head of the OMB, and he agreed last year that this \nyear they would put that all on line at the time they give it to the \nAppropriations Committee. This is simply another sunshine amendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. COBURN. I am happy to.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to ask the Senator, in the spirit of full \ndisclosure, when we considered the asbestos bill, which the Senator \nsupported, there was one corporation that would have benefited to the \ntune of more than $1 billion by that asbestos bill. In the interest of \nfull disclosure of special interest groups and who is pushing \nlegislation, would the Senator from Oklahoma also demand that kind of \ndisclosure so we know if there is a change of a word or two, and one \ncorporation, one lobbyist, or one special interest group is a big \nwinner in a bill that is not an appropriations bill? Is the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma going to demand the same disclosure?\n  Mr. COBURN. Certainly, in answer to the Senator's question. On the \ntrust fund, we never got to know who was going to give the money. It \nwas same thing. So there are big problems everywhere. I believe in \nsunshine everywhere. You won't see me fighting sunshine. The people of \nthis country deserve to know what is in the bills, what is in the \nreports, and what is in the requests and the justifications.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. COBURN. I only have 45 minutes to get through three other \namendments. I don't want to put this into a political game. What I want \nto do is talk about what the American people ought to be getting from \nus. This language ought to be changed so that we accept the \nAppropriations Committee getting the reports early, but then the \nDepartment of Homeland Security making it available to the rest of the \nAmerican public, provided it doesn't have a security implication within \nit. It is a very straightforward amendment. I hope the committee will \naccept it and keep it in in conference.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham). The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, we have no problem with this proposal. The \nDepartment will have a problem with it simply because if the Senator \nhas followed the activities of this Department, their ability to \nproduce the reports requested is limited or at least their efforts have \nnot been stellar. In any event, it is a reasonable request. I ask \nunanimous consent that the amendment be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4561) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4585\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside and amendment No. 4585 be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4585.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds available to the Coast Guard for \n  operating expenses for the continuation of operations of Long Range \n                Aids to Navigation stations nationwide)\n\n       After section 539, insert the following:\n       Sec. 540. None of the amounts available or otherwise \n     available to the Coast Guard under title II of this Act under \n     the heading ``United States Coast Guard'' under the heading \n     ``operating expenses'' may be obligated or expended for the \n     continuation of operations at Long Range Aids to Navigation \n     (LORAN) stations nationwide.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I know there is going to be a radical \ndifference of opinion on this amendment. Let me explain. This is about \nthe LORAN stations nationwide. This is an old-time aid to navigation \nthat this bill has requested another study of. This has been studied. \nThere are volumes of reports from every agency of the Federal \nGovernment that has anything to do with this. All of them say we don't \nneed this system anymore.\n  LORAN stands for long-range aids to navigation. The original LORAN-A \nsystem was developed during World War II. LORAN-C, where we are today, \nwas developed during the 1950s and 1960s. There are 24 LORAN stations \nacross the United States. One of them is actually in my State.\n  These stations send out radio signals and LORAN receivers on board \nvessels and aircraft measure the differences in the time that it takes \nfor a signal to come back and determine both the longitudinal and \nlatitudinal positions. It is used rarely for some civilian navigation, \nbut it is no longer a primary source for civilian navigation needs \nbecause it has been replaced with a far superior system called global \npositioning or a satellite-based system. That has been totally \nfunctioning since 1994.\n  The plan was released February 10, 2006. It was prepared by the \nDepartment of Defense, the Department of Transportation, and the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. The Coast Guard requested to terminate \nthis program. There is no longer a need for the Coast Guard for either \nprimary or secondary. If GPS fails, there are other systems that back \nit up besides LORAN. And it is not needed for the Department of \nTransportation. The Department of Defense said they don't need it. The \nDepartment of Homeland Security, the Coast Guard, and the FAA said they \ndo not need it. In this bill, it calls for DHS and DOT to submit a \nreport to the Senate Appropriations Committee that requires them to \ncome up with excuses to continue the LORAN operation. Here is the \nreport.\n  I would like to submit for the Record the report and also the \nstatement of administration policy on this.\n  The administration objects to this provision because it is going to \npostpone the inevitable. This is a program that we don't need. Every \nagency of the Federal Government that uses this program or has been \ninvolved with it says they don't need it anymore. There are special \ninterests that might want it, but the country doesn't need it. The \nGovernment doesn't need it. You don't need it for navigational \npurposes.\n  I am quoting now:\n\n       The Department of Transportation has conducted numerous \n     studies that make clear that the benefits of terminating the \n     LORAN system far outweigh the costs. Furthermore, as \n     discussed in the Subcommittee Report, the Global Positioning \n     System is a far superior navigational aid, with sufficient \n     backup capabilities in place to meet the Coast Guard's needs \n     for the Maritime Transportation System [and to meet the FAA's \n     need for air travel, and the Department of Homeland Security, \n     as well as the Department of Transportation].\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to print that in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           Statement of Administration Policy, July 12, 2006\n\n\nH.R. 5441--department of homeland security appropriations bill, fy 2007\n\n       The Administration supports Senate passage of the FY 2007 \n     Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Bill, as \n     reported by the Senate Appropriations Committee.\n       The President's FY 2007 Budget holds total discretionary \n     spending to $872.8 billion and cuts non-security \n     discretionary spending below last year's level. The Budget \n     funds priorities and meets these limits by proposing to \n     reform, reduce, or terminate 141 lower-priority programs. The \n     Administration urges Congress to fund priority needs while \n     holding spending to these limits, and objects to the use of \n     gimmicks to meet those limits. The Administration looks \n     forward to working with Congress to adopt the President's \n     proposals to cut wasteful spending in order to maintain \n     fiscal discipline to protect the American taxpayer and \n     sustain a strong economy.\n       Although the bill is largely supportive of the President's \n     request, the Administration would like to take this \n     opportunity to share additional views regarding the \n     Committee's version of the bill.\n     Border and Transportation Security\n       The Administration appreciates the funding provided by the \n     Committee for border\n\n[[Page S7371]]\n\n     and immigration enforcement and strongly urges the Senate to \n     fully fund 1,500 new Border Patrol agents and 6,700 \n     additional detention beds and associated costs, as requested. \n     On May 15th, the President outlined his five-part plan for \n     comprehensive immigration reform. The Administration is \n     committed to securing the resources necessary to gain control \n     of the border through deployment of additional Border Patrol \n     agents, as well as adding infrastructure and technology, such \n     as access roads, fences, vehicle barriers, tactical \n     communications, and aerial surveillance. These resources, \n     coupled with additional legal authority from Congress, will \n     end the practice of ``catch and release'' along the southern \n     border by increasing detention and removal capabilities. The \n     Administration is committed to working with Congress to \n     implement an immigration enforcement strategy that will give \n     our law enforcement authorities operational control of our \n     Nation's borders as a part of the Administration's \n     comprehensive immigration reform initiative.\n       The Administration is concerned that the Committee did not \n     include the requested increase for aviation security \n     passenger fees. The Senate is urged to include this provision \n     to ensure that the direct beneficiaries of aviation security \n     measures bear a greater share of the cost of implementing and \n     maintaining a secure screening system.\n       The Administration strongly supports the provision to \n     provide the Department with the flexibility to employ a risk-\n     based strategy for focusing aviation screening resources \n     on significant and emerging threats to aviation security. \n     The Administration supports section 524 of the Committee's \n     proposed bill that will provide additional direction to \n     the Department and information to Congress on protection \n     of Sensitive Security Information without compromising \n     security.\n     State and Local Programs\n       While the Administration appreciates the Committee's \n     commitment to State and local grant and training programs, \n     the funding provided does not effectively target Department \n     of Homeland Security (DHS) resources. Overall funding for \n     programs administered by the Office of Grants and Training is \n     $504 million above the President's request, providing \n     resources to lower priority programs that support individual \n     infrastructure sectors or organizations and emphasize basic \n     response equipment for local agencies. Resources should be \n     shifted to fully fund programs that target high-risk targets \n     and combine security efforts across the Nation's \n     infrastructure sectors such as the Urban Areas Security \n     Initiative and the proposed Targeted Infrastructure \n     Protection Program. The Administration also urges the Senate \n     to fully fund the Citizens Corps initiative, which helps to \n     encourage greater citizen participation in local preparedness \n     efforts.\n     Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)\n       The Administration appreciates the Committee's support of \n     FEMA's core operating expenses, flood map modernization, and \n     the pre-disaster mitigation grant program. The funding \n     provided for the pre-disaster mitigation grant program will \n     protect people and buildings from flood damage, earthquakes, \n     and wind damage from hurricanes and tornados. The \n     Administration also strongly supports the transfer of the \n     National Disaster Medical System to the Department of Health \n     and Human Services, consistent with the recommendations of \n     the White House Katrina `Lessons Learned' report.\n       The Administration strongly urges the Senate to provide the \n     full request level for FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund (DRF). The \n     amount provided for the DRF is $316 million below the \n     President's request. The requested funding is based on the \n     five-year average of total disaster costs, excluding large \n     one-time events such as Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Full \n     funding of the DRF is important to ensure that DHS is able to \n     respond appropriately to the Nation's unforeseen events and \n     natural disasters.\n     Management\n       The Administration strongly opposes any effort to reduce or \n     eliminate funding for the DHS MAX HR initiative. This human \n     resource management system is designed to meet the diverse \n     personnel pay and benefit requirements of DHS.\n       The Administration is concerned that funding for the design \n     and buildout of a new Coast Guard Headquarters at the St. \n     Elizabeth's campus was not included in the bill and urges \n     that it be restored. This facility has been identified by the \n     General Services Administration as the only Federally-owned \n     secure campus readily available in Washington, D.C. It is \n     critical that the Coast Guard headquarters be constructed in \n     a timely manner and these funds are needed to ensure the \n     facility is constructed on schedule, address serious \n     spatial needs of the agency, and support infrastructure \n     development for eventual tenancy by other DHS components.\n     Coast Guard\n       The Administration strongly objects to the provision that \n     would postpone decommissioning of the LORAN system and would \n     require additional cost-benefit analysis. The Department of \n     Transportation has conducted numerous studies that make clear \n     that the benefits of terminating the LORAN system far \n     outweigh the costs. Furthermore, as discussed in the \n     Subcommittee Report, the Global Positioning System is a far \n     superior navigational aid, with sufficient backup \n     capabilities in place to meet the Coast Guard's needs for the \n     Maritime Transportation System.\n     Secret Service\n       The Administration urges the Senate to include the \n     establishment of a Special Event Fund to meet the unique \n     security needs of the Secret Service to be prepared for \n     special events. These funds have been requested in a separate \n     account to ensure that resources are dedicated to meet \n     special events overtime and travel needs.\n     Citizenship and Immigration Services\n       The Administration appreciates the funding provided for \n     expansion and improvements to immigration verification \n     systems to more effectively verify employment eligibility and \n     benefit records. These resources support the Administration's \n     comprehensive immigration reform initiative, and the \n     Administration urges the Senate to fully fund efforts to \n     automate U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services' business \n     processes and systems, which will improve its ability to \n     collect, process, and provide immigration-related benefits.\n     Science and Technology\n       The Administration appreciates the funding provided by the \n     Senate supporting the Department's research, development, \n     test and evaluation (RDTE) requirements. However, the \n     Administration strongly urges the Senate to restore the \n     Management and Administration appropriation funding needed to \n     ensure the necessary resources for the proper planning, \n     prioritization, management, execution, and oversight of the \n     RDTE programs.\n       The Administration is opposed to the transfer of the \n     Transportation Security Laboratory (TSL) and explosives \n     threat funding from Science and Technology (S) to the \n     Transportation Security Administration. S is best \n     positioned to prioritize, develop, and execute the innovative \n     research programs necessary to achieve significant results \n     against explosive threats. S is also best suited to foster \n     the research and development capabilities of the TSL and \n     leverage these capabilities to support the entire Department.\n     Preparedness\n       The reduction in funding for the National Preparedness \n     Integration Plan will limit the ability of the Preparedness \n     Directorate to implement initiatives based on Katrina \n     `Lessons Learned' recommendations. At the funding level \n     proposed by the Senate, the program will not be able to \n     support needed improvements in telecommunications \n     capabilities. DHS will work with Congress to better define \n     the role of the proposed Federal Preparedness \n     Coordinators, and avoid duplication of other DHS \n     functions.\n       The Administration is also concerned about the aggregate \n     reduction of $24 million from the request for funding of \n     Infrastructure Protection and Information Security \n     activities. The $20 million reduction in the National \n     Security/Emergency Preparedness Telecommunications program \n     will diminish the ability to provide priority wireless \n     connectivity in disaster-affected areas and implement \n     recommended improvements from the Administration and Congress \n     to emergency communications infrastructure.\n     Domestic Nuclear Detection Office\n       The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for \n     the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO), but strongly \n     recommends that the full funding requested be provided. This \n     initiative is a priority of the Administration and failure to \n     fully fund DNDO research and development programs will \n     appreciably delay the availability of new technologies for \n     detecting radiological and nuclear materials in cargo, at our \n     borders, and elsewhere. Specific reductions in funding will \n     delay the deployment of next-generation equipment for \n     detecting nuclear devices; hinder efforts to leverage the \n     research capabilities of our Nation's universities; and delay \n     efforts to track the source of radioactive materials.\n     Competitive Sourcing\n       The Administration strongly opposes provisions that limit \n     competitive sourcing. Section 516 imposes a legislative \n     restriction on the use of competitive sourcing for work \n     performed by the Immigration Information Officers at the U.S. \n     Citizenship and Immigration Services, and section 537 \n     overrides Executive Branch discretion to consider public-\n     private competition by dictating that commercial classroom \n     training performed at the Federal Law Enforcement Training \n     Center is an inherently governmental activity. Precluding \n     public-private competition for performance of these \n     activities deprives the Department of the operational \n     efficiencies to be gained by competition, and limits its \n     ability to direct Federal resources to other priorities.\n       Management decisions about public-private competition, and \n     accountability for results, should be vested with the \n     Department. On a Government-wide basis, the improvements set \n     in motion by competitions completed between FY 2003 and FY \n     2005 will generate an estimated savings that will grow to \n     over $5 billion over the next 10 years. The Senate is urged \n     to strike these restrictions.\n     Reports and Penalties\n       While the Administration understands the need for prompt \n     delivery of reports to Congress and makes every effort to do \n     so, the Committee's requirement to deliver reports on \n     complicated matters before receiving funding could inhibit \n     the Department's efforts to carry out its mission.\n\n[[Page S7372]]\n\n     Constitutional Concerns\n       Several provisions of the bill purport to require approval \n     of the Committees prior to Executive Branch action. These \n     provisions are found under the following headings: ``United \n     States Visitor and Immigrant Status Indicator Technology''; \n     ``Automation Modernization,'' ``Technology Modernization,'' \n     and ``Air and Marine Interdiction, Operations, Maintenance, \n     and Procurement,'' within Customs and Border Protection; \n     ``Automation Modernization'' Immigration and Customs \n     Enforcement; ``Protection, Administration, and Training,'' \n     United States Secret Service; ``Management and \n     Administration,'' Preparedness and Recovery Preparedness; \n     ``Management and Administration,'' Science and Technology; \n     and section 509. Since these provisions would contradict the \n     Supreme Court's ruling in INS v. Chadha, they should be \n     changed to require only notification of Congress.\n       Section 521 of the bill, relating to privacy officer \n     reports, should be stricken as inconsistent with the \n     President's constitutional authority to supervise the unitary \n     executive branch.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I draw the attention of my colleagues to the formal \nreport on the LORAN system as put forward by the three agencies.\n  We are going to hear debate that there is not sufficient backup. Let \nme answer that first. The 2005 Federal Radio Navigational Plan reported \nthat the U.S. Coast Guard has determined that there are backups. LORAN \nis not needed for it. In case there is a GPS failure, conventional \nnavigation is used, using all available equipment which includes GPS, \nDGPS, radar, lights, buoys, celestial navigation, daymarks, and dead \nreckoning. There are seven backups besides this.\n  Coast Guard Congressional Affairs has indicated that LORAN is one of \nmany backups. It is not needed for aviation backup. They have very \nhigh-frequency omnidirectional beacons that give the same backup. \nDistance measuring equipment, the ILS systems, a backup to GPS, it is \nnot going to be long when we won't even have ILS systems at airports. \nWe will probably have somebody who wants to keep those in. The fact is, \nwe need to recognize the technology. These dollars would be better \nspent somewhere else.\n  The Coast Guard is going to spend $35 million in 2007 on operations \nand the maintenance of the LORAN system. The Federal Aviation \nAdministration will spend between $15 and $25 million on \nrecapitalization. The Coast Guard tried to start getting rid of this in \n2000. The FAA at that time said they still needed it. They now no \nlonger need it. It will take another 6 to 10 years and another $300 \nmillion to complete the recapitalization that was mandated since 2000 \nfor a program this isn't needed.\n  Here are the savings: $500 million over the next 7 years if we go on \nand terminate a program that we don't need and nobody needs as a \nbackup.\n  The Senate report on this bill and the proponents of LORAN will claim \nthat GPS used along with LORAN provides the most accurate positioning. \nThat is one of the claims. They aren't even used in tandem anymore. If \nyou are looking at GPS, you don't use the LORAN system. And GPS is far \nsuperior to anything that LORAN could give us. One of the claims will \nbe that shutting down will adversely affect other Federal agencies that \nuse LORAN. The navigational plan asked for by this Congress indicated \nthat it is no longer a mission-essential device. It is not needed for \neither a primary or secondary source for positioning, navigation, or \ntiming for the Department of Defense, the Department of Transportation, \nor the Department of Homeland Security. Who is that? That is the FAA, \nthe Maritime Commission, the Coast Guard, all of them saying: We don't \nneed this. Yet we are going to spend another $500 million over the next \n7 years if we don't get rid of it.\n  So it is simple. Somebody wants it, yes. Why? There are special \ninterests that will want this to continue. But the fact is, a half a \nbillion dollars is a lot of money that we don't have. We ought to \neliminate this program. I know there are others who disagree with that. \nI look forward to the debate.\n  I yield the floor at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the amendment. \nCertainly, I understand the intent of the amendment, which is to \nterminate the LORAN program. This is a program that affects a lot of \nour small airplanes, maritime safety, their ability to communicate in \nthe Pacific Northwest waters. I know Senator Stevens from Alaska has a \ndeep concern about this as well.\n  We know that at some point the LORAN system is going to be changed. \nThe problem is that the Coast Guard alone, which I have tremendous \nrespect for, made a decision to terminate the LORAN system without \ntalking to the FAA, without talking to DOD, and without talking to many \nof the other users of the LORAN system. This bill makes sure that as we \nmove toward a new structure within the waters in the area of the \nPacific Northwest and up into Alaska and other places along the coast, \nwe do it in a way that makes sure that all of the users of the system \nare not impacted in a way that makes them unsafe or their travels \nunsafe.\n  It is unwise for us to terminate this program without the consent and \nthe understanding of these other organizations. We had a debate about \nthis in the Appropriations Committee. The committee agreed with us that \nas we move forward on the termination of the LORAN program, we need to \nmake sure that the Department of Defense, the FAA, small maritime \nusers, and everybody who relies on this for safety in the waters along \ncoastal regions is on board and we move forward in a way that doesn't \ncause any harm to any of the users of the system.\n  I respect the Senator in trying to eliminate funding and trying to \nmake sure that we are making the best use of public resources. But it \nhas to be done in a way that doesn't impact the safety of our many \nmaritime and airline users.\n  I will oppose the amendment. I know Senator Stevens from Alaska has \nbeen very involved in the debate. I believe he is on his way to the \nfloor as well. I urge our colleagues to listen carefully to the safety \nand the use of many people in our coastal waters as we move forward on \nthe matter of closure of the LORAN system.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, this language was added to the bill in \ncommittee. It did not arise out of the original mark. I opposed the \naddition of this language because I agree with the Senator from \nOklahoma. I have a lot of confidence in the Coast Guard. In fact, \nwithin this agency, the Coast Guard is clearly one of the best run, \nmost efficient and most professional groups in our entire Government. \nThe Coast Guard has come to the conclusion they don't need the system, \nthat it is ancillary to the basic needs of navigation.\n  It is a lot like maintaining a black-and-white television when \neverybody has gone to color--or high definition now. Hand-held GPSs are \nlike little telephones. You can carry them anywhere. The accuracy and \ninstantaneous locating of those devices is extraordinary, especially \ncompared to LORAN.\n  There is no need to keep this black-and-white technology. We should \nphase it out. The Coast Guard has come up with a plan for doing that. \nWe can save some money, and with that money we can put it into other \nthings the Coast Guard does need. I support the amendment.\n  There are other Members who wish to speak. I don't think we should go \nto a vote until we have given people the time to come and put their 2 \ncents in. I support the amendment.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I have a couple of comments to the Senator \nfrom Washington State. LORAN won't go away if this instruction for this \nstudy is taken out. There are still 4 years that LORAN will be there \nunder the Coast Guard's plan. I also remind the Senator that the FAA \nhas already said they don't need it. The Maritime Commission has said \nthey don't need it. The Coast Guard has said they don't need it. Who \nneeds it when we have other backups? It is true that in 2000 the FAA \nsaid we don't have sufficient backup to eliminate LORAN. They have \nsince, in the report--the study that has already been made--said they \ndon't need it. So this is a report to extend the life of LORAN, \nsomething that we don't need.\n  I know the Senator from Alaska will oppose this. I look forward to a \nvigorous debate with him.\n  I will soon ask unanimous consent again to submit the 2005 Federal \nradio navigational plan into the Record so everybody can see all the \nclaims that\n\n[[Page S7373]]\n\nhave been made by the groups that supposedly don't need it. The plan \nhas already been done. It is not required as a navigational backup.\n  Now, will some people somewhere want to get a better navigational \nsystem? Yes. You can buy a GPS system for a boat now for about $300 and \nyou can have something far superior than LORAN ever was or you can use \nthe VOR system or one of the myriad--seven other backups for maritime \nwithout using LORAN.\n  With that, I ask unanimous consent that this amendment be set aside, \nand I will call up another amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4589\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask that amendment No. 4589 be called \nup.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4589.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To reduce appropriations available for certain training, \n          exercises, technical assistance, and other programs)\n\n       At the appropriate place, add the following:\n       Nothwithstanding any other provision of this Act, the \n     amount made available in title III of this Act under the \n     heading ``Office for Domestic Preparedness, State and Local \n     Programs'' is reduced by $25,000,000 and the amount made \n     available under such heading for ``training, exercises, \n     technical assistance, and other programs'' is reduced by \n     $25,000,000\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, this is a very simple amendment. The \nImproper Payment Information Act was enacted in 2002. It was very \nspecific, and Congress was very wise to do it. What it said is that the \nagencies have to make an assessment of improper payments.\n  Now, what the American people don't know is that at least $65 billion \nin improper payments--payments made by the Federal Government to people \nwho don't deserve to get them--are made every year. Think about that: \n$1.6 billion in food stamps; $20-some billion at the Pentagon; $42 \nbillion in Medicare improper payments; $30 billion in Medicaid improper \npayments. So the $60 billion number I quote is a very conservative \nestimate.\n  What we saw with Katrina is that tons of improper payments were made. \nBut we had the Department of Homeland Security say they didn't have any \nimproper payments. That is what they asserted to this Congress in 2005. \nThe fact is that they didn't do the studies which were necessary to \nassess whether they were at risk. The $65 billion that I quote \nrepresents only 18 of 70 entities of the Federal Government, and it is \nonly 18 out of 70 that are reporting.\n  The Department of Homeland Security, in its fiscal year 2004 \nperformance and accountability report, said none of its programs or \nactivities were deemed to be at significant risk for making improper \npayments. The OMB put some special definitions on what that is. It is \n$10 million or 2.5 percent. We know of at least a billion dollars that \nhas been wasted in Katrina that we can document right now. The \nDepartment has since admitted they are finding and reporting improper \npayments for 2005 that were not in full compliance with the law.\n  We are seeing that everywhere in my Subcommittee on Federal Financial \nManagement, where we look at these agencies. They actually ignore the \nlaw and don't make a concerted effort. Senator Obama and I asked in \nSeptember that a chief financial officer be set up in terms of the \nresponse in September of last year to Katrina. We never got that \nthrough, but had we gotten that through, we would be a billion dollars \nahead of where we are today, just in terms of the funds for Katrina.\n  The price tag is going to be over $200 billion in Federal money by \nthe time we finish. If you take the rate of improper payments within \nDHS just in terms of Katrina, we are probably going to have $2 billion \nor $3 billion in improper payments.\n  For the record, I believe it is important that the American public \nknow why we ought to be having an assessment of how we spend our money. \nSixteen percent of the dollars and assistance initially spent after \nKatrina and Rita was spent on divorce, sex changes--bogus things--and \n$1.5 million went to credit card waste, a 1-week Caribbean vacation, \nfive season tickets to the New Orleans Saints, and Dom Perignon in San \nAntonio. A thousand credit cards were given to people with Social \nSecurity numbers belonging to State and Federal prisoners, and $14,000 \nwas given to an inmate in a Louisiana jail. Subcontracting--we were to \npay, on average, $32 per cubic yard for debris removal, but the actual \ncost was $68. We had the rest taken up in layers of subcontractors. I \ncould go on and on, but I will not.\n  This amendment gives a million dollars to the Chief Financial Officer \nof the Department of Homeland Security and says: Do improper payments \nreporting. I ask that this be accepted by the committee because it \nmakes common sense and we have a real problem in Homeland Security with \nwaste, fraud, and abuse. To start fixing that, we must know what the \nproblem is.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I could not agree more. As far as the \nmillion dollars, I am happy to reallocate it toward this activity. This \nis a huge amount, but I don't think it should be understated how much \neffort is being made to try to figure out how much in the way of funds \nhas been either mishandled, fraudulently handled, wasted, and the first \ncut just on the individual side is $1.8 billion. As a result of \nKatrina, the number is going to be much higher when they get into the \npublic area of rebuilding roads, schools, and hospitals. However, the \nDepartment is trying, and certainly the inspector general of the \nDepartment is trying very hard. He has a very highly structured task \nforce--a series of them--to try to manage these dollars. The results \nare not too complete. We are starting to get hard information, but \ndollars have been wasted, and it is inexcusable. If this technical \naccounting process is something that should be followed, I have no \nproblem with proceeding in this way.\n  I don't want to imply that this is going to resolve the problem. The \nproblem is much bigger than this. The issue is whether the inspector \ngeneral can get his arms around everything that has happened down \nthere. You are not only dealing necessarily with the Federal folks who \nare giving us the issues; there are a lot of local and State issues \nabout how Federal money is being spent here that is very questionable. \nUnfortunately, people took advantage of the American taxpayers' \ncompassion for folks who have been devastated in that part of the \ncountry. Some people saw that as an opportunity to take advantage of \nthe American taxpayers. We are very creative people sometimes in that \narea, and unfortunately it happened.\n  There is a genuine effort to try to make sure the money is spent \neffectively, and there is an equally genuine effort by the inspector \ngeneral to follow up on money that has not been spent correctly. So I \nwelcome this effort as part of the fight to make sure tax dollars are \nspent effectively.\n  I ask that the amendment be agreed to.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I made an error in the number of the \namendment I called up. I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be \nset aside and the true number be 4590 instead of 4589 and that the \ndebate be considered with regard to No. 4590 rather than 4589.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I wish to respond to the chairman for a \nminute. I know this isn't going to solve the problem. This takes away \nthe excuse for not doing proper payment analysis at the Department of \nHomeland Security. I know they are working hard in that regard.\n  Mr. President, I note that the Senator from Alaska is here. I wonder \nif we might recall amendment No. 4585.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator wish to report 4590 first?\n\n[[Page S7374]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 4590\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask that amendment No. 4590 be reported.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4590.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To make appropriations available for the Chief Financial \n  Officer of the Department of Homeland Security to ensure compliance \n  with the Improper Payments Information Act of 2002 (31 U.S.C. 3321 \n                                 note)\n\n       On page 127, between lines 2 and 3 insert the following:\n       Sec. __. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, \n     $1,000,000 shall be made available from appropriations for \n     training, exercises, technical assistance, and other programs \n     under paragraph (4) under the subheading ``state and local \n     programs'' under the heading ``Office for Domestic \n     Preparedness'' under title III, for the Chief Financial \n     Officer of the Department of Homeland Security to ensure \n     compliance with the Improper Payments Information Act of 2002 \n     (31 U.S.C. 3321 note).\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Reserving the right to object, is that the pending \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That was the amendment that was just brought \nup. That was the amendment that was the subject of the previous \ndiscussion.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, can I clarify? It is very confusing. The \nSenator from Oklahoma called up the wrong amendment. Would the Chair \nexplain exactly what is the pending amendment?\n  Mr. COBURN. The pending amendment is exactly as I described. It is an \namendment that moves $1 million to the chief financial officer of \nHomeland Security so they will do the improper payments report.\n  Mr. GREGG. I believe that amendment has been agreed to and disposed \nof.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I think the problem is the Senator mentioned \nthe wrong number. It is not 4589; it is 4590, and the Senate agreed to \n4590.\n  Mr. COBURN. That is correct.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be agreed \nto.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Has that amendment been agreed to or set aside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator sent up amendment No. 4589. It was \nhis intent to send up amendment No. 4590. He asked that amendment No. \n4589 be set aside, and we now reported amendment No. 4590.\n  Mr. GREGG. Has it been reported yet?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It has been reported as the pending amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent that it be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Reserving the right to object, what is this amendment?\n  Mr. GREGG. This deals with the transfer of $1 million to the finance \nofficer.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, simply to \nclarify, so we are all on the same page, the chairman of the committee \nis asking that we agree to the amendment that was just debated, that \nwas called up, that the Senator had the wrong number; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Right.\n  Mr. GREGG. And this is the amendment dealing with the transfer of $1 \nmillion to the finance officer.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator is asking us to agree to that amendment that \nwas debated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the Chair's understanding.\n  Mr. GREGG. Now the pending amendment is the amendment on LORAN.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to amendment No. 4590 being \nagreed to, the $1 million amendment? Without objection, the amendment \nis agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4590) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4585\n\n  Mr. GREGG. And the pending business is the LORAN amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Now the pending question is amendment No. \n4589.\n  Mr. GREGG. That is not the LORAN amendment. We set that one aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Apparently amendment No. 4589 and amendment \nNo. 4585 are both pending.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that amendment No. \n4585 be called up at this time, which is, as I understand, the LORAN \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The clerk will report.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, may I clarify then that amendment No. \n4585 is pending? From what I understand from the Chair, both amendments \nare pending. I ask unanimous consent that amendment No. 4589 be laid \naside and that the pending amendment be amendment No. 4585.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Just for the clarification of the Senate, we are now back \non the LORAN amendment; is that correct, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. As far as I can tell.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, is there a time limit on the amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time limit.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the amendment of the Senator from \nOklahoma will delete an amendment I offered in committee. This is what \nit says:\n\n       The committee denies the request to terminate operations at \n     LORAN stations nationwide and directs the Secretary to \n     refrain from taking any steps to reduce operations at such \n     stations. The committee further directs the Secretary, in \n     consultation with the Secretary of Transportation, to submit \n     a report to the Appropriations Committee and the Commerce \n     Committee regarding the future of the LORAN system. The \n     report shall include the cost benefits, the merits of \n     maintaining the LORAN system as a backup navigational aid, \n     and the benefits of using the LORAN system in conjunction \n     with the global positions system. The report shall be \n     submitted to the committee within 180 days of enactment of \n     this act.\n\n  I did hear my good friend from Oklahoma indicate he would like to \nhave some vigorous debate. I don't know how vigorous it is going to be. \nI do want to tell the Senate that this amendment means a great deal to \nmy State, obviously, with half the coastline of the United States, with \na number of areas that are affected by this LORAN system.\n  The LORAN system has not been modernized in my State, although it has \nbeen in all the rest of the country. In recent years, we have \nappropriated approximately $160 million to the Federal Aviation \nAdministration and the Coast Guard to modernize the LORAN structure \nthrough an existing interagency memorandum of agreement that existed \nbetween the two agencies. The recapitalization primarily came through \nthe FAA budget, while the Coast Guard has provided resources to operate \nand maintain this system.\n  The proposal to terminate LORAN was not coordinated with the \nDepartment of Transportation or the FAA and certainly was not \ncoordinated with my State. The decision to terminate this system should \nnot unilaterally be controlled by the Coast Guard.\n\n  I am constrained to tell the Senate, this is just another example of \nthe problems of representing the largest State in the Union with \nagencies that are not properly represented in our State.\n  The LORAN system was originally developed as a radio navigational \nservice for coastal waters and was later expanded to include complete \ncoverage of the Continental U.S., as well as all of Alaska. Originally, \nit really was designed for an area like the coastal waters off our \nState.\n  LORAN-C provides coverage for maritime navigation in the U.S. coastal \nareas, particularly in Alaska, and provides navigation, location, and \ntiming services for civil and military air, land, and marine users.\n  We welcome the advent of the global positioning system. It is an \ninvaluable navigational aid. The LORAN system uses a very strong \nwavelength and signal strength which enables it to penetrate areas \nwhere GPS has difficulty and will not work because of line-of-sight \nblockage.\n  The LORAN system is an independent system. It can serve as a backup \nfor GPS. Until the people who have equipment to use LORAN are able\n\n[[Page S7375]]\n\nto switch to GPS and have it be shown that GPS will work in every area \nwhere it is necessary to navigate--I remind the Senate, 70 percent of \nthe cities in my State can be reached only by air. We have the largest \narea and the largest involvement in fishing in the Nation. Over half of \nthe fish consumed in the United States comes from Alaska.\n  This is an independent system and really it ought to be maintained as \na backup to the GPS, in our opinion, at least until the complete \nmodernization of the older vessels and the older airplanes that were \ndesigned to use LORAN.\n  The modernization of LORAN is almost complete. As I said, we spent \n$160 million in the past few years to do that. It can be used as a \nbackup to GPS to better produce an estimate of location than either \nsystem acting alone.\n  The LORAN system is a national asset. Again I say, it was not \ncoordinated with the Department of Transportation, particularly the \nFAA, in terms of making this recommendation.\n  It just so happens that the first weekend of the last recess, just 10 \ndays ago, I had occasion to travel with my son down one river and up \nanother in Alaska in a vessel that had GPS. He is a qualified pilot for \nany vessel in the United States. At one point, at around 11 o'clock at \nnight, we were traveling through a fog. We were talking about the \nnavigational systems. The difficulty people have is they don't \nunderstand what it means to live in an area where it can be dark for \nseveral months and operating in a fog at night--all day long, as a \nmatter of fact, in darkness in some instances.\n  The fisheries vessels and the systems off our State depend on LORAN \nfor accurate positioning. It is true that GPS is a better system where \nit works better, but it has not had the findings and analysis that this \ncommittee amendment asks be prepared. That is, the Secretary of \nCommerce is asked to make a study, along with the Secretary of \nTransportation, and report to us the analysis of the cost-benefits of \nthis LORAN system, the merits of maintaining it as a backup \nnavigational aid, and give us that within 180 days.\n  In other words, for 180 days, we have a hiatus to determine whether \nwe should follow the report made by the Coast Guard or whether we \nshould listen to those involved in the fishing systems and in the \naviation systems in a State such as mine.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, will the Senator from Alaska yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the Senator from Alaska just made a point \nthat I think is critical that we understand. During the debate prior to \nthe Senator coming to the floor, the point was made by the Senator from \nOklahoma that there are a number of other backup systems that are \navailable to users of the system in the coastal waters off Alaska and \nother States.\n  From what I just heard from the Senator from Alaska--and I want to \nclarify this--because of the mountainous regions, because of the \ninaccessibility and a lot of the difficult geographic locations that \nexist within his State, we are not positive that many of those backup \nsystems work; is that correct?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, it is my understanding that there are \nareas in our State where GPS does not provide the accuracy it does in \nother places because of the line-of-sight problem, whereas because of \nthe very strong wavelength and signal strength LORAN puts out, \nparticularly the modernized LORAN-C, it is an absolute necessity right \nnow.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask the Senator then, what he is saying \nto us is it could, indeed, put many people at risk because we do not \nknow yet whether those systems are working in many of the geographic \nlocations within his State?\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator is absolutely right. We just cannot \nterminate this system all at once. It is true it can be phased out in \nmany places in the country without any harm to anybody. But the people \nwho rely on the system right now as the sole source of their navigation \nshould not be abandoned.\n  As a matter of fact, I have prepared a second-degree amendment which \nI will be glad to offer if the Senator from Oklahoma does not \nunderstand our situation. It is a second-degree amendment which would \ndelete the amendment, as the Senator wishes, but substitute for it a \ncomplete indemnity by the United States of any harm that comes to any \nperson who presently is relying on LORAN because they cannot have \nnavigation capability.\n  We believe there is going to be substantial harm to a lot of people \nif this is not done right. The current system just says ``terminate.'' \nIf they did so by cost-benefit analysis on a nationwide basis, they did \nnot do it on a cost-benefit analysis in the area where it is needed. \n``Where it is needed'' is what makes a difference.\n  We do not say this program should exist forever. We believe in the \nfinal analysis that it probably will be terminated. But when it is \nterminated, it should be phased out on a geographical basis so it stays \nin effect in the areas where it is absolutely needed until it can be \nreplaced by a system which would have to upgrade GPS, and that is not \nin the plan of the Department of Commerce at all.\n  I think this is wrong to take out our amendment. I believe the \namendment is a reasonable one. All it says is we postpone the \ntermination operations. We refrain from taking steps to reduce \noperations at these stations where they are needed. If that is not \nacceptable to the Senate, then I say, all right. If the Senate, in its \nwisdom, is going to take a total cost and benefit analysis on a \nnationwide basis and leave people who depend on this system now \ncompletely without a navigation system they can rely on, then they \nshould be indemnified for any harm that comes to them as a result of \nthe premature termination of this system.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his words. I want \nto clarify something which is just my understanding, and please correct \nme if I am wrong.\n  The GPS is never limited by line of sight. It is a satellite. It is \nthe LORAN system that is limited by line of sight. The mountainous \nstructures in Alaska limit the LORAN system. GPS is far superior to the \nLORAN system. That is accurate. Both as a pilot I know that and from \nwhat we have said.\n  The other point that I would make--\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, if I could just answer that.\n  Mr. COBURN. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator is right, but at the same time, he is wrong. \nSatellites don't work everywhere in Alaska because of problems in \nupdating their signal. The same is true for GPS. You must have a \nsatellite signal that can reach for GPS.\n  Mr. COBURN. I would concede that.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Many places in our State did not have access to GPS \nbecause the satellite is not ubiquitous for the world. It does not come \ndown in some places of our State.\n  Mr. COBURN. I would concede to the Senator that there are occasional \ntimes that the GPS cannot be utilized. I would concede that.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I want to make certain, Mr. President, that the Senator \nunderstands what I am saying. There are places where GPS cannot be \naccessed in Alaska.\n  Mr. COBURN. There are also places where LORAN cannot be accessed in \nAlaska today.\n  Mr. STEVENS. That is true, in some places. But where it has been \noperating, LORAN is relied upon in places where GPS cannot reach.\n  Mr. COBURN. I would concede to the Senator that LORAN can be used in \nplaces where GPS cannot be utilized. But I would also concede that the \nstudy that asked for this has already been done. Everything that this \nstudy asked for has already been put forward. The 2005 Federal \nRadionavigation Plan answers every question you have asked in this \namendment.\n  What the Department of Transportation says, what the FAA says, what \nthe Maritime Commission says, what the U.S. Coast Guard says is LORAN \nis not needed for a backup for a navigational system anywhere in this \ncountry. That is what they say, and that is what you are asking for. \nThey have also done a cost-benefit analysis, and they have said, \nwithout question, the cost-benefit is on the side of eliminating LORAN.\n  Let's talk about what it will cost. The Government estimates it will \ncost $300 million to upgrade the LORAN\n\n[[Page S7376]]\n\nsystem in Alaska over the next 6 to 7 years. And what they are \ncertifying--and I understand the concern of the Senator from Alaska \nbecause some people might not have a system they are used to today. But \nwhen these agencies certified that LORAN is not needed as a secondary \nbackup, that is what you are asking them for in the study, and they \nhave already said it is not needed.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield? That is not what I am asking \nfor.\n  Mr. COBURN. I will finish my point, and then I will turn the time \nover to the Senator.\n  Mr. President, the Federal Radionavigation Plan is a 120-page report. \nLet me just go through it real quickly.\n  FAA has said: Sufficient alternative navigational aids exist in the \nevent of a loss of GPS-based services. They have VOR, which they have \nin Alaska.\n  The Maritime Administration determined that there would not be \nsignificant disruption in the movement of vessels in and out of U.S. \nports or affect commercial enterprises as traditional aids to \nnavigation are still in use and capable.\n  The Department of Homeland Security has determined that LORAN-C is \nnot needed as a backup for timing users, as adequate alternatives are \nalready in place.\n  The Federal Railroad Administration said they have no need for LORAN.\n  The bottom line: The accuracy of LORAN in these areas can be equally \ndegraded and compromised, and therefore, there would be no material \ndegradation in navigational safety should GPS be the only RNAV source \nfor Alaska. Traditional backups for maritime navigation would still be \nin place: VTSs, buoys, ranges, radar, lighthouses, and fathometers. \nSince 1997, $160 million has been appropriated to recapitalize LORAN. \n$117.5 million of that has been transferred to the Coast Guard. It is \nestimated that it will take another 6 to 10 years and $300-plus million \nto recapitalize that.\n\n  The point is, even without the amendment of the Senator from Alaska, \nhis addition in committee, it is 4 years before this is decommissioned. \nSo it gives 4 years for anybody who has any problem with it a chance to \nadjust to that problem.\n  I would offer to the Senator from Alaska that there might be a \ncompromise that we could discuss in keeping LORAN working just for \nAlaska where there is a problem, rather than keeping LORAN working \neverywhere else there is not a problem. I would suggest there may be a \ncompromise to address the issues of concern that the Senator from \nAlaska has, that would also save us a considerable amount of money and \nsolve his problems with those who feel at risk without elimination of \nLORAN. I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the Senator is quite generous in his \nsuggestion, but I have to say that we heard on April 18 of this year \nfrom the Department of Transportation the following:\n\n       The Department of Transportation has not formulated a \n     position regarding the future of LORAN. It is our hope, \n     however, that it will be possible, consistent with the \n     Federal Radionavigation Plan, for the administration to \n     announce a final, fully considered decision before the end of \n     the calendar year. That decision should be made \n     collaboratively with due regard for the mandates in NSPD 39 \n     relating the identification of a backup for GPS.\n\n  In terms of where we live on the Pacific, the problem is we \nappropriated the money for modernization of LORAN but, unfortunately, \nit was improved in areas where it wasn't needed anymore, and in the \narea where it is still needed, it was not.\n  We are in a situation now where our people still rely upon LORAN. We \nwere told that the Department of Transportation did not participate in \nthis study. We now know that the Department of Transportation says that \nfrom a cost-benefit analysis, the whole system is not justified. That \nmay well be. That may well be. All we are asking for is this analysis \nnow to be made of the system, and the merits of maintaining LORAN as a \nbackup navigational aid and the benefits of using it in conjunction \nwith the Global Positioning System.\n  We believe that in areas where it doesn't work continually, GPS ought \nto be backed up by LORAN and vice versa. But particularly in terms of \nthe long coastline of the Pacific coast--and we are part of the Pacific \ncoast--we were not included in the study. This benefit-to-cost ratio is \na national conclusion and not a conclusion based upon the areas where \nLORAN is currently used. In many areas of the country, it has been \ntotally abandoned, and it ought to be abandoned. We don't have any \nproblem with that. But steps to reduce operation at stations where this \nLORAN is still in use and is relied upon today is wrong. If there is to \nbe some decision along that line, we will be happy to try and work that \nout in conference with the Senator. But maybe we should say the \nSecretary should refrain from taking any steps to reduce LORAN at \ncertain stations but nationwide.\n  I will be happy to change that, so he should not be prevented from \ntaking steps to reduce operations at any station where it is not \ncurrently relied upon for navigation, either directly or as a backup to \nGPS.\n  Now, that means the Pacific coast. I am led to believe the same thing \nexists off California, off Oregon, and Washington to a lesser extent \nthan it does off my State. You have to remember that half of the \ncoastline is off our State, as I said, and in the areas where small \nboats, small planes currently rely upon LORAN as a backup, or in some \ninstances as the total system, it should not be eliminated without a \nstudy of that area.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, let me just add that I support the \nrecommendation that Senator Stevens has just made, and if we are able \nto work that agreement out, I think that would be good.\n  I do want to amplify something quickly that I stated earlier in the \ndebate, and it was repeated by my colleague from Alaska, and that is \nthat DHS came to this decision without adequate consultation with other \nimpacted Federal agencies. If there is any confusion over that \nquestion, I would like to put in the Record and ask unanimous consent \nto insert a letter from the Honorable Jeff Shane, Under Secretary of \nTransportation, to the Honorable Stewart Baker, the Assistant Secretary \nof Policy at DHS.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 Department of Transportation,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 12, 2006.\n     Hon. Stewart Baker,\n     Assistant Secretary for Policy, Department of Homeland \n         Security, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Stewart: The future of the Long Range Navigation \n     (LORAN) system has been the subject of debate for many years. \n     In 1994, the Clinton Administration announced plans to \n     terminate the LORAN system based on its expectation that \n     emerging Global Positioning System (GPS) technology would \n     fully respond to the needs of LORAN users. In response to \n     strong support from industry and the public as well as \n     analyses showing key GPS vulnerabilities, however, Congress \n     has continued to fund LORAN. That funding has gone to the \n     United States Coast Guard for LORAN operations and to the \n     Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for LORAN \n     modernization.\n       According to the 2005 Federal Radionavigation Plan, signed \n     by the Secretaries of Homeland Security, Defense, and \n     Transportation, ``DOT, in coordination with DHS, will make a \n     decision regarding the future of LORAN by the end of 2006.'' \n     Related mandates are set forth in National Security \n     Presidential Directive 39, establishing a U.S. space-based \n     positioning, navigation, and timing policy. According to the \n     unclassified fact sheet accompanying NSPD 39, the Secretary \n     of Homeland Security shall, ``[i]n coordination with the \n     Secretaries of Defense, Transportation, and Commerce, develop \n     and maintain capabilities, procedures, and techniques, and \n     routinely exercise civil contingency responses to ensure \n     continuity of operations in the event that access to the \n     Global Positioning System is disrupted or denied. . . .'' \n     Elsewhere, the fact-sheet says that the Secretary of \n     Transportation shall, ``[i]n coordination with the Secretary \n     of Homeland Security, develop, acquire, operate, and maintain \n     backup position, navigation, and timing capabilities that can \n     support critical transportation, homeland security, and other \n     critical civil and commercial infrastructure applications \n     within the United States, in the event of a disruption of the \n     Global Positioning System. . . .'' (Emphasis added.)\n       For some time now, the Coast Guard has indicated its desire \n     to decommission the LORAN system. The FAA is similarly \n     interested in being divested of LORAN responsibilities. \n     Neither agency believes that LORAN is necessary today to \n     support its respective mission. From the perspective of the \n     two agencies, those assessments are undoubtedly correct. But \n     the future of LORAN\n\n[[Page S7377]]\n\n     should be determined by reference to the broader national \n     interest. Might LORAN serve as the backup to GPS contemplated \n     by the mandates of NSPD 39? Apart from its potential as a \n     backup to GPS, does its robust, low-frequency, penetrating \n     signal offer potential value in our effort to secure the \n     international supply chain? Are there other possible \n     backups to GPS that offer clear advantages over LORAN? If \n     we decide that LORAN should be maintained, which agency \n     should shoulder responsibility for maintaining it? If we \n     decide that LORAN should not be maintained, what should we \n     do to persuade Congress that continued funding of the \n     system is no longer in the national interest?\n       DOT has not formulated a position regarding the future of \n     LORAN. It is our hope, however, that it will be possible, \n     consistent with the Federal Radionavigation Plan. for the \n     Administration to announce a final, fully considered decision \n     before the end of this calendar year. That decision should be \n     made collaborativeIy with due regard for the mandates in NSPD \n     39 relating to the identification of a backup for GPS.\n       DOT looks forward to working together with DHS and with \n     other interested agencies in the interest of bringing this \n     issue to closure. I will be in further touch to discuss the \n     best process for pursuing this important objective.\n       With best regards.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Jeffrey N. Shane,\n                                       Under Secretary for Policy.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, what this letter simply does is make it \nclear that DOT is willing and ready to discuss this matter, but it also \nmakes clear that there are other issues, especially in aviation, as the \nSenator from Alaska has said, that really have to be worked through as \nwe move toward this, and I ask that we have those considerations.\n  Again, I hope the language that Senator Stevens has proposed is \nsomething that can be worked out because I think that would be amenable \nto all of us.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I would just make a couple of points.\n  Norm Mineta of the Department of Transportation signed this report on \nOctober 21, 2005--the Secretary of the Department of Transportation--\nthe Federal Radionavigation Plan. So for the Department of \nTransportation to claim now that they didn't agree with this report, \nwhen their Secretary and his staff signed off on the report, there is \nsomething amiss. There is some miscommunication.\n  What I would like to do is note the absence of a quorum in the hopes \nthat I could work with the Senators from Alaska and Washington to come \nto a compromise on this amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, if the Senator will withhold, I would \nlike to make one point with a letter I am quoting from, dated April 18, \n2006. It was addressed to Assistant Secretary of Policy at Homeland \nSecurity, and it says:\n\n       The future of LORAN should be determined by reference to \n     the broader national interest. Might LORAN serve as the \n     backup to GPS contemplated by the mandates of NSPD 39? Apart \n     from its potential as a backup to GPS, does its robust, low-\n     frequency, penetrating signal offer potential value in our \n     effort to secure the international supply chain? Are there \n     other possible backups to GPS that offer clear advantages \n     over LORAN?\n\n  None of that has been answered.\n  Now, certainly, this is after the Secretary signed off on that plan, \nbut the idea of abandoning LORAN prematurely was not signed off on by \nthe Department, to my knowledge.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I would note that in the report, the \nconsiderations for backups are very well and very explicitly listed, \nincluding Alaska's backup system. So I agree that there is some \nconfusion and there certainly is some difference in what was signed off \non the report and what we are hearing now.\n  I would ask to note the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, if the Senator will withhold, I would \nsuggest that we move on to another amendment. Senator Biden is here, he \ncould proceed with his amendment, and during that time Senators could \nperhaps work something out.\n  Mr. COBURN. I have no objection.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4553\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 4553.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Biden] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4553.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To increase amounts for the rail and transit security grant \n                   programs, and for other purposes)\n\n       On page 91, line 6, strike ``$2,393,500,000'' and insert \n     ``$3,493,500,000''.\n       On page 91, line 22, strike ``$1,172,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$2,272,000,000''.\n       On page 92, line 13, strike ``$150,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$1,250,000,000''.\n       On page 92, line 16, before the semicolon, insert the \n     following: ``, of which--\n       (i) $670,000,000 shall be for tunnel upgrades along the \n     Northeast corridor;\n       (ii) $250,000,000 shall be for passenger and freight rail \n     security grants;\n       (iii) $100,000,000 shall be for research and development of \n     bomb detection technology; and\n       (iv) $65,000,000 shall be for intercity passenger rail \n     security upgrades, of which $25,000,000 shall be used--\n\n       (I) to provide a 25 percent salary increase for existing \n     Amtrak Police personnel; and\n       (II) to expand the Amtrak police force by 200 officers\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I realize that particularly the Presiding \nOfficer and my friends from New Hampshire and Washington State are \nprobably tired of hearing me stand up year after year since 9/11 and \ntalk about rail security or the lack thereof in the United States of \nAmerica. This amendment is about rail security.\n  The funding made available in this amendment is, unfortunately, \nsomething that I have, with others, fought for without success since 9/\n11. In fact, immediately after 9/11, I introduced legislation that is \nvery similar to the amendment I am offering today that would provide \ncritical resources to enhance rail security and rail infrastructure. \nAlmost 5 years later, after introducing the legislation in the 108th \nCongress and the 109th Congress, we have done virtually nothing.\n  In March of 2004, our allies in Spain suffered an attack on their \nrail system that killed 191 people. We did nothing. We did nothing at \nhome. Just over 1 year ago, terrorists in London killed 52 people and \ninjured over 700, mostly on rail. We did virtually nothing. The attack \nin London occurred just 1 week before we had a debate on the 2006 \nHomeland Security budget. Unbelievably, we approved only $150 million \nfor rail and transit, with only $7 million going to Amtrak, which \ncarries, by the way, 64,000 passengers per day--hardly, I would say, a \nserious effort.\n  Just yesterday, in Mumbai, India, there was another attack on rail. \nSo far there are 190 confirmed dead, 714 people injured. To state the \nobvious, I am sure every one of my colleagues feels as I do, but our \nthoughts and prayers are with those who were harmed in yesterday's \nattack. As they described in today's New York Times and I am sure every \nother paper in the Nation, there was baggage and body parts strewn for \nhundreds and hundreds of yards around the site of the explosion. \nCoincidentally, here at home we are debating again the appropriations \nbill for Homeland Security.\n  I wonder how long we can dodge the bullet. I wonder how long it will \nbe that we can avoid accountability for what we are not doing to \nprotect our rail and transit system. I don't know what it is going to \ntake for us to wake up and take this threat seriously. Certainly \neveryone understands here at home that the threat is real and it is at \nhome. The FBI has warned us of the threat to our rails. In fact, the \nCentral Intelligence Agency has found photos of rail stations and rail \ncrossings in safe houses in Afghanistan. I am sure they weren't doing \nthat for a geography project for their kids. It was about looking at \ntargets in America.\n  Remember when we saw that they had taken photos of American \nbuildings, what we did? We immediately mobilized our security forces \naround those buildings here in the United States, because we knew if \nthey had photos of those buildings tacked up on the walls they must be \nthinking of them as targets. What do we need? Do we need someone from \nal-Qaida to write us a note and say: ``By the way, folks, we are \nplanning on attacking your rail system''? ``We are not going to tell \nyou when, but we are going to attack your\n\n[[Page S7378]]\n\nrail system.'' What do we need? What do we need to be able to jog the--\nnot ``conscience,'' that may be the wrong word--jog this body into a \nsense of reality?\n  We have still done virtually nothing. Since 9/11 the administration \ninvested over $25 billion in aviation security, primarily to screen \npassengers. I voted for that, I agree with that--$25 billion. During \nthe same period, less than $600 million has been allocated for rail and \ntransit systems that carry a whole heck of a lot more passengers. This \nyear's budget includes an additional $6 billion for aviation security, \nwhich I support. Only $150 million has been allocated for rail and \ntransit security. Out of the $150 million allocated for rail and \ntransit funding this year, $7 million went to Amtrak. I don't think \nthat is a serious effort--again, 64,000 people a day.\n  I understand you can't protect every single inch of our vast rail \nstructure but we can do some pretty commonsense things, some block-and-\ntackle things that we know will make us a lot safer. I can't stop \nanyone, nor are we likely to be able to stop anyone, from putting an \nIED that is fashioned in America on a track somewhere between here and \nWilmington, DE, when I take the train every day. I am not asking for \nthat. But I will tell you what we can do. What we can do is go to those \nareas we know are prime targets, where hundreds if not thousands of \npeople could die if al-Qaida or any of their copycat organizations \ndecided to move on rail and were successful.\n  Take a walk over to Union Station. Union Station is just down the \nstreet in that direction. I walk to it or drive to it every single \nnight the Senate is in session. I come from it every day. It is the \nsingle most visited place in Washington. Do you hear me? The single \nmost visited place in Washington, DC. More people are in and out of \nthat station than are at any museum, than visit the Congress, the White \nHouse, the FBI. It is the single most visited place in Washington, DC.\n  Take a look. As I say to security people, get with me on an Amfleet \ntrain. Not an Acela, because they don't have the old kind of caboose on \nit. Stand in the last car and look out the window as you pull out of \nthe train station. Tell me how many cameras you observe. Tell me how \nmany cops you see. Tell me how many bits of protection--whether it is \nfencing or alarm systems--that are on the switching devices that are in \nthat yard. Tell me how many folks you see wandering the yard where you \nsee trains stacked up, where people can cross around just a plain old \nchain-link fence and put some C2 up underneath an existing train.\n  Or travel from Washington south. You go underneath the Supreme Court. \nYou go underneath one of the House office buildings. Tell me what you \nsee. Are there any guards patrolling that area? I am not going to say, \nbecause people will say to me, You are just giving terrorists \ninformation. I promise you, they already know it. You would be stunned \nhow few law enforcement officers are on duty at any one time in that \nentire infrastructure.\n\n  My amendment simply makes the investment that the experts who have \ntestified have repeatedly told us is needed. It would provide an \nadditional $1.1 billion for rail security upgrades. Out of this amount \nwe would provide $670 million to upgrade the tunnels along the \nNortheast corridor to add ventilation, lighting, escape routes, in some \ncases cameras, and the ability to be able to patrol those tunnels.\n  I will not take the time because my colleagues have heard me do it \n1,000 times. The tunnel that goes from here heading to Boston--in fact, \nit goes through the State of Maryland, through Baltimore--it was built, \nI think, in 1869. Next time you ride through it, look and see if you \nsee any ventilation. Tell me what you see in terms of lighting. Tell me \nwhat you see about any prospect of someone being able to escape from \nthat tunnel. Tell me if you see any security going in and out of that \ntunnel.\n  It seems like a long time ago, I have been doing it so long, there \nwas a fire in a tunnel. It was just a plain old fire, not a rail \ntunnel, another tunnel going into Baltimore. The fire shut down all the \nharbor, and it shut down all of south Baltimore.\n  If you go up into New York, you have six tunnels sitting under New \nYork City without any appreciable work being done on any of them since, \nroughly, 1918. Ask any expert about ventilation. Why am I talking about \nventilation? Drop sarin gas in that tunnel, drop another chemical in \nthat tunnel, and tell me what happens without any ventilation to suck \nit out. Tell me what you see in those tunnels. Ask those experts what \nchance there is of escape. I will go back to that in a minute.\n  There is $250 million to be allocated to general security upgrades \nfor freight rail operations, including transport of hazardous material. \nI had an amendment here on another bill not long ago because I asked \nthe Naval Research Institute, NRI, to answer a question for me. Again, \nI apologize to my colleagues from Washington and New Hampshire for \ncontinuing to repeat this, but I asked the question: What would happen \nif a chlorine gas tanker exploded in a metropolitan area?\n  Remember, I guess it was a year or year and a half ago, one exploded \nup in the Dakotas--not near any big city. They had to evacuate several \ntowns in the region. I said, What would happen?\n  The standard chlorine gas tanker on rails is about 90 tons. What \nhappens if one of those were exploded? They said it would kill or \ninjure up to 100,000 people.\n  I had an amendment. Why don't we allow the cities to be able to \ndivert these hazardous cars around the cities. It got voted down--I \nactually did get a vote on it--because it would somehow increase the \ncost of doing business. It would increase the cost of doing business.\n  Maybe I am missing something here. The only thing I can believe is \nthat most of my colleagues also think that this is not likely to \nhappen, that these guys aren't going to go after transit, they are not \ngoing to go after freight rail, they are not going to go after \npassenger rail. They really don't mean it so we don't really have to \nworry.\n  It reminds me of that Calypso song that was popular about a decade \ngo, ``Don't worry, be happy.''\n  Yet if we look around the world, bombings and attacks on rail systems \nare becoming increasingly sophisticated. They are carried out by \nterrorist groups. Before 9/11 when we saw these terrorist activities \nhappening in Europe and other parts of the world, we just seemed \nimpervious to it. ``It can't happen here. It won't happen here.''\n  I made a speech on September 10. I ask unanimous consent that a copy \nof it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n U.S. Foreign Policy in the 21st Century: Defining Our Interests in a \n                             Changing World\n\n       My mother wanted me to be a priest or a politician, and for \n     the longest time I didn't think you could do both. But you \n     can. Any rate, obviously not a lot of Irish-Catholics in this \n     room.\n       Well, what I want to know before we begin is--Chestnut Hill \n     Academy is here, I'm told, from Philadelphia. And what I want \n     to know is, when I went to a Catholic boys' school in \n     Claymont, Delaware, called Archmere, Chestnut Hill Academy \n     used to occasionally beat us--more occasionally than was \n     necessary. And I want to know, are you guys here in support \n     or opposition? What's the deal?\n       Welcome, fellas. I don't know why you're here, but it's \n     nice to see you all here. Thank you for being here.\n       It is true, I am now the chairman of the Foreign Relations \n     Committee--through no fault of my own. My dad has an \n     expression: It's better to be lucky than good. I am chairman \n     because one man in Vermont decided he was going to leave one \n     political party and giving my party the ability to organize \n     the Senate. For that, I am grateful, but I want you to know I \n     understand that this could change any day.\n       By the way, the president and I agree on a lot of things, \n     and we sincerely do. I thought the president's first trip to \n     Europe quelled a lot of concerns and nerves on the part of \n     our European friends, who are always upset and always nervous \n     with any transition in power in the United States. I think \n     the president did an extremely good job in the incident \n     relating to our, quote, ``spy plane'' being down. I think the \n     president has done some very, very good things.\n       I do have a profound disagreement with the president's view \n     of national missile defense and whether or not, at the end of \n     the day, it would make us more or less secure.\n       At the end of the Cold War, when the wall came down, we \n     found ourselves on the brink of extraordinary changes. All of \n     us were wondering what it would mean and where this would \n     lead. Was it the beginning of something or the end of \n     something? And if it was\n\n[[Page S7379]]\n\n     the beginning, were we, the United States, the only remaining \n     superpower, going to get it right?\n       On that night, we were all idealists, but a new day dawned \n     and a harsh reality came into focus. It became clear that \n     long-standing ethnic, religious, tribunal and nationalistic \n     divisions had not changed, while America's place in the world \n     had changed profoundly.\n       From that day on, we inherited a profound obligation of \n     leadership, and an even more profound obligation to get it \n     right in the Middle East, in the Balkans, in Europe and Asia, \n     in our hemisphere, in our commitments, our treaties and in \n     our defense policy--missile or otherwise.\n       Now, the spotlight remains on us and is brighter than ever. \n     We're at a pivotal moment when American values and principles \n     have taken center stage like no other time in our history in \n     the global theater. How we perform on that stage is as much \n     about our honor, our decency, our pride, as it is about our \n     strategic policy.\n       So before we go raising the starting gun that will begin a \n     new arm's race in the world, before we dip into the Social \n     Security trust fund to satisfy the administration's almost \n     theological allegiance to missile defense at the expense of \n     more earth-bound military and international treaties, before \n     we watch China build up its nuclear arsenal and see an arm's \n     race in Asia and in the sub-continent, before we squander the \n     best opportunity we've had in a generation to modernize our \n     conventional nuclear forces, let's look at the real threats \n     we face home and abroad. Let's re-engage and rethink and meet \n     our obligations with a strength and resolve that befits our \n     place in this new world.\n       American foreign policy should not be based primarily on \n     the principle of national self-interest that defines strength \n     as rigid adherence to inflexible theory, or positive results \n     as emotionally satisfying unilateral action.\n       I don't believe our national interests can be furthered, \n     let alone achieved, in splendid indifference to the rest of \n     the world's views of our policies. Our interests are \n     furthered when we meet our international obligations and when \n     we keep our treaties. They're furthered when we maintain \n     an unequal military, able to deter any threat at any place \n     at any time and anywhere, when we keep our economy strong, \n     when we make wise choices that solves real problems, when \n     we stand bound together as democracies--multi-racial, \n     multi-ethnic, multi-religious beacons of hope--not some \n     dark house next door.\n       President Reagan's image of a ``shining city on a hill'' \n     held out America as an ideal to millions and millions of \n     people around the world, a nation that reaches out to its \n     allies and adversaries alike, with undiluted, unequivocal \n     message that democracy works, freedom is worth the fight, and \n     that America will always be a reliable friend of those who \n     take the risk of achieving the goals of democracy.\n       We can't forget or simply disregard the responsibilities \n     that flow from our ideals. We can't lose sight of the fact \n     that leadership requires engagement, and partnership demands \n     inclusivity. Let there be no mistake, America must remain at \n     the table because walking away comes at a price. Our European \n     allies should never think that America ignores international \n     opinion or that we're ready to go it alone when we feel like \n     it. They should never think that our commitment to a vital \n     multi-national institutions, or projects, which are built \n     upon common values and common concerns--and that includes \n     NATO--has diminished.\n       We became a European power in the 20th century, and out of \n     our self-interest, we must remain a European power in the \n     21st century. We've got to get it right in Europe. We have to \n     stay engaged in the Balkans--as this administration appears \n     to be doing--and bring them, the Balkans, into the European \n     community. It's in our naked self-interest.\n       But let's understand that our foreign policy is as much \n     about American values as it is about complex multinational \n     treaties or arcane intricacies of strategic policy.\n       When I think of the moral imperative of American \n     leadership, I think of an America founded upon the \n     unshakable, bedrock democratic principles, but willing to \n     accept the principal ideals and cultural dynamics and genuine \n     concerns of our allies; a nation that has a powerful sense of \n     place in the geopolitical scheme of things--one that is \n     tough-minded when it comes to our own security, yet has broad \n     enough vision and a strong enough will to contribute to \n     peaceful solutions where age-old strains of nationalism and \n     religious-based divisions wreak havoc; a government that \n     doesn't abandon arms control treaties with the excuse that \n     they are relics of the Cold War.\n       I might note parenthetically, I think many of those \n     uttering that phrase are in fact themselves the relics of the \n     Cold War. They have not come to understand the wall is down \n     and the last time they were in power it was up. Half this \n     city doesn't realize that.\n       And not abandon these agreements as relics of the Cold War \n     because it's (inaudible) to honor them because we've \n     negotiated them in good faith, we signed and ratified them, \n     and because they have stood the test of time in serving our \n     national interest and other nation's expect us to keep our \n     promises; a unique and strong nation that isn't confused \n     about its role and responsibilities and doesn't walk away \n     from the table, but sits down, rolls up its sleeves and \n     convinces the world of our position; a nation that thinks big \n     and sees freedom in global economic growth as consensus \n     ideals.\n       I think of America vastly different--so unburdened of the \n     old Cold War fears and feelings that it's willing to do a \n     little soul-searching. Are we a nation of our word or not? Do \n     we keep our treaties or don't we? Are we willing to lead the \n     hard way, because leadership isn't easy and requires us \n     convincing others? Diplomacy isn't easy. Multilateral policy \n     initiatives aren't easy.\n       Or are we willing to end four decades of arms control \n     agreements to go it alone--a kind of bully nation sometimes a \n     little wrong-headed, but ready to make unilateral decisions \n     in what we perceive to be our self-interest, and to hell with \n     our treaties, our commitments and the world?\n       Are we really prepared to raise the starting gun in the new \n     arms race in a potentially more dangerous world? Because, \n     make no mistakes about it, folks, if we deploy a missile \n     defense system that's being contemplated, we could do just \n     that.\n       Step back from the ABM Treaty, go full steam ahead and \n     deploy a missile defense system, and we'll be raising the \n     starting gun. If the president continues to go headlong, \n     headstrong on this theological mission to develop his missile \n     defense system, if he does what he says and drops \n     objections to China's missile buildup, not only will we \n     have raised the starting gun, we'll have pulled back the \n     hammer.\n       Let's stop this nonsense before we end up pulling the \n     trigger.\n       China now has about 20 intercontinental ballistic missiles, \n     but according to press reports, the National Intelligence \n     Council thinks that China might deploy up to 200 warheads, \n     develop sophisticated decoys and perhaps move to multiple \n     warheads in response to a missile defense system.\n       It seems to me it's absolute lunacy for us to invite China \n     to expand its arsenal and resume nuclear testing, not to \n     mention that moving forward with missile defense could \n     jeopardize Chinese cooperation on the Korean Peninsula.\n       Let me remind you all that there are two types of \n     modernization they talk about. And there's no doubt the \n     Chinese are going to modernize. But up to recently, what most \n     people thought the modernization meant and our community \n     thought it meant was moving, for example, from liquid fuel \n     rockets to solid fuel rockets. Moving from systems that were \n     not mobile at all to more mobile systems.\n       Not increasing, as the press has reported, 10-fold more \n     than they would have if we build a national missile defense. \n     Not MIRVing their missiles, meaning put more than one atom \n     bomb or hydrogen bomb on top of an ICBM. The most \n     destabilizing weapon that exists.\n       I found it interesting, on MacNeil-Lehrer, Secretary \n     Rumsfeld saying that it wasn't the question of MIRVing that \n     was important, it was a question of the total number of \n     missiles.\n       Well, George--President Bush, the first President Bush--\n     understood that it was more than that. We fought for years \n     and years to do away with the big SS-18 Soviet missiles. Why? \n     Because they're what we saw, I say to the gentleman from \n     Chestnut Hill Academy, they're what we call a use-or-lose \n     weapon.\n       Because they have such an incredible concentration of \n     power, you assume that they will be struck first. Therefore, \n     if there is a warning that you're under attack, which \n     sometimes they're mistaken, they're on a hair trigger and you \n     must launch them or lose them.\n       That's why we're so fearful that the Russians will keep \n     their MIRVed systems, because they have such a porous defense \n     system. They have such a porous early warning system. And as \n     a nun I used to have would say, in a slightly different \n     context, ``the only nuclear war that's worse than one that is \n     intended is one that wasn't intended.''\n       In Seoul, I spoke with President Kim Dae-jung of South \n     Korea about ways to bring North Korea, which is the new \n     bogeyman that we're all looking at now, which is the \n     justification for this pell-mell race to produce the \n     international missile defense, how to bring them into the \n     family of nations.\n       He urged me to encourage the administration to engage North \n     Korea in senior-level dialogue and not allow a theological \n     commitment to missile defense to blind us to the prospects of \n     signing a verifiable agreement to end North Korea's \n     development, deployment and export of long-range missiles.\n       Yesterday, Dr. Rice, on Meet the Press--she and I were on \n     Meet the Press--she talked about how ubiquitous these long-\n     range missile systems were. I don't know what she's talking \n     about. We're getting briefed by two different groups of CIA \n     people, I guess, because none of these rogue nations have \n     that capacity yet. They may get it. It is maybe within their \n     reach, but it does not exist now.\n       If we spur on an aggressive Chinese buildup, including the \n     need to test--and you know why they will have to test. When \n     you put more than one--I know most of you know this, but it's \n     worth repeating--you put more than one atom or hydrogen \n     weapon on top of a rocket, it requires more throw weight in \n     that rocket. It has to be more powerful.\n       So practically what you have to do is you have to make \n     smaller, more compact missile warheads. And in order to be \n     able to be sure they work, you've got to test them. So if, in \n     fact, the Chinese are going to move to a modernized system \n     that requires--that's going to contemplate MIRVed ICBMs, \n     they're going to have to test.\n\n[[Page S7380]]\n\n       That's why I got so upset by the statement read by the \n     press account that we appeared to be willing to trade off, in \n     return for them not objecting to our building the national \n     missile defense system, the possibility that we would look \n     the other way when China tested and that we understood they \n     were going to have a considerable buildup.\n       That's what I call a self-fulfilling prophesy.\n       And let me ask you the question: Consider what India is \n     likely to do if China tests. Those of you who know the \n     subcontinent know that there's been an incredible political \n     tug to have another test of their, quote, ``hydrogen \n     weapon,'' because they believe the world does not believe \n     that they successfully tested one, and they want the world to \n     believe they have one.\n       And what do you think happens when India tests, if China \n     tests?\n       What do you think happens in Pakistan? Pakistan, I believe, \n     would ratchet up its production. And consider that Taiwan, \n     the two Koreas or Japan or all of them could build their own \n     nuclear weapons. Japan has the capacity within one year to \n     become a nuclear power.\n       That greatest generation that Tom Brokaw speaks of, my \n     mother and father's generation, did two incredibly good \n     things, and I mean this as not an insult, to particularly my \n     German friend. Germany is a non-nuclear power and Japan is a \n     non-nuclear power. That's good for the world. I want to be no \n     party to setting in motion a series of events that will cause \n     the Japanese Diet to reconsider whether they should rely upon \n     the nuclear umbrella of the United States.\n       And as the former chancellor of Germany, Helmut Schmidt, \n     once said to me, sitting in his office 15 years ago, he said, \n     ``You don't understand, Joe, my son's generation does not \n     feel the same sense of obligation or guilt that mine does.''\n       Are we so dead set positive that a missile defense system \n     furthers our national interest that we're willing to risk an \n     arms race? So sure of the science that we're willing to \n     weaponize space and nuclearize Asia?\n       Are we so sure of the feasibility that we'll divert \n     potentially hundreds of billions of dollars from the real \n     needs of our military?\n       Look, the fact is we could weaponize space or we could buy \n     339 F-22s to replace our aging F-15 fleet for $62 billion. We \n     could replace aging F-16s, A-10s, A-14s with a Joint Strike \n     Fighter for the cost of $223 billion. We could replace the \n     Cobra and Kiowa warrior helicopters for $39 billion. I could \n     go on and on.\n       But in short, we could provide our Army, our Navy, Air \n     Force and Marines virtually everything they need in the \n     immediate future for a more stealth, more significant lift \n     capacity military to deal with the real threats we face and \n     still spend less on all of that than we will spend on the \n     national missile defense system.\n       We're facing a difficult budget fight with a consequence of \n     the turndown in the economy, the business cycle, the $1.3 \n     trillion tax cut, or all of the above, and we can't have our \n     cake and eat it too. The administration would like us to \n     think it's all possible, but it's not all possible.\n       According to the Congressional Budget Office, we may have \n     already dipped into the Social Security trust fund, which we \n     used to do regularly in years past, but which we all promised \n     we wouldn't do anymore, we would have a lock box. And that \n     $21 billion or more will be consumed from that lock box in \n     the next three years. This is a very different economic \n     picture than projections of just a few months ago.\n       Missile defense has to be weighed carefully against all \n     other spending and all other military priorities, which we're \n     not debating or doing right now. And in truth, our real \n     security needs are much more earthbound and far less costly \n     than national missile defense.\n       If you combine the $1.3 trillion tax cut with what we've \n     spent on a full-blown missile defense shield, we could start \n     to modernize our conventional forces, build a stealthier, \n     more mobile, more self-sufficient military that I believe is \n     needed in the 21st century, and make significant impact on \n     rectifying what is going to be a gigantic problem in 10 \n     years in Social Security.\n       Let's be clear: When it comes to defense, it's not the \n     president's missile defense or nothing, as the way it's being \n     posed. We should improve military personnel retention and \n     overall readiness; bring on the next generation of fighter \n     aircraft, the next generation of helicopters, the next \n     generation of destroyers; and be fully prepared for the next \n     generation of engagement.\n       And while we're at it, we may fix the plumbing in the \n     barracks at Taipei, which I just visited, which the night \n     before I came, because they are so aged and we don't have the \n     money to fix them, they had to bring in water hoses from \n     outside to allow the women and men in there to be able to \n     shave, to be able to use the bathrooms, let alone drink any \n     water. Visit the conditions in which our active military are \n     living now--two and three in a room. You think when you drop \n     your kid off at a college dormitory and you're paying 30 \n     grand to send him to a prestigious school is hard to take, \n     take a look at the conditions they live in. And why are we \n     not responding to it? We don't have the money, we are told.\n       My dad used to say, and still says, ``Son, if everything is \n     equally important to you, nothing is important to you.'' Our \n     priorities, I think, are a little out of whack. I've said, \n     and I'll say it again, we should be fully funding the \n     military and defending ourselves at home and abroad against \n     the more likely threats of short-range cruise missiles or \n     biological terrorism.\n       Last week, the Foreign Relations Committee began hearings \n     on how to build a so-called ``homeland'' defense and to \n     protect our military from bioterrorism pathogens and chemical \n     attacks; on how we can deploy a missile defense system that \n     doesn't trade off conventional modernization of our military \n     for a fantasy of some system that remains more flawed than \n     feasible; on how we can jump-start the destruction of \n     Russia's massive chemical weapons stockpile and secure all \n     our nuclear materials.\n       The very day they send up a budget that tells they are \n     going to increase by 8-point-some billion our missile defense \n     initiative, they cut the program that exists between us and \n     Russia to help them destroy their chemical weapons, keep \n     their scientists from being for sale and destroy their \n     nuclear weapons.\n       I've said, and I'll say it again, we should work with \n     Russia and China and all of our allies to stem proliferation \n     of weapons of mass destruction; we should try to rely on some \n     mutual deterrence, rather than thinking we can replace it, \n     because, in fact, deterrence works.\n       We should support research and development in boost phase \n     interceptors that would avoid the countermeasures and would \n     be more acceptable to Russia and China, limiting the \n     possibility of ending Russia's adherence to START II and \n     lessening the prospects of a new arms race in Asia than what \n     we are now proposing.\n       We should strive through hard-nosed diplomacy to delay and \n     eliminate the long-range ballistic threat by ending North \n     Korea's program and its sale of long-range missile \n     technology. We should build a combined offensive and \n     defensive system that we know works before we deploy it. And \n     we should amend the ABM Treaty and not walk away from it.\n       Having said that, let's put the cost and the effectiveness \n     of this missile defense system being discussed today in some \n     context so that everyone understands exactly what we're \n     talking about. The cheapest realistic system suggested, \n     national missile defense system, limited national missile \n     defense system suggested by this administration, which relies \n     on the same midcourse interceptors the Clinton administration \n     proposed, would cost at a minimum $60 billion over 20 years \n     and most suggest it would be closer to $100 billion.\n       And remember, this is only for a system that's incapable of \n     shooting down a missile carrying biological weapons, \n     incapable of shooting down a missile carrying chemical \n     weapons, at least for now incapable of shooting down a \n     missile with an unsophisticated tumbling warhead that will \n     look just like a tumbling trajectory.\n       In order to combat what are known as countermeasures, such \n     as those decoys or the submunitions that carry biological \n     weapons, the administration proposes a layered defense. That \n     means, a missile defense that begins with a boost phase \n     interceptor, that is, catching the rocket as it takes off \n     from behind, at its slowest point and nearest point; \n     continues with a midcourse interceptor, that is, getting \n     it out there in the atmosphere and a bullet hitting a \n     bullet; and finishes with a terminal defense as it's \n     coming down.\n       Now, you think the midcourse system we're working on is \n     expensive. Help me calculate the cost of a layered missile \n     defense, where we haven't even begun some of the research.\n       One recent estimate for that system is a quarter trillion \n     dollars, and I think that, too, is a conservative figure, \n     because the truth is that the administration has yet to \n     comprehend the full complexities and the technological \n     challenges of a layered defense. If you doubt me, ask folks \n     like General Welch and others who used to run the show.\n       In my view, that full-blown layered missile defense system, \n     which doesn't address a single real issue on the ground, is \n     more likely to cost a half a trillion dollars. And what will \n     it get us? For half a trillion dollars we may get a layered \n     defense system that's not been defined yet. If it includes \n     space-based lasers, you've now weaponized outer space, which \n     invites other countermeasures to attack the satellites on \n     which we depend for information and communications.\n       But it still won't be 100 percent effective. Secretary \n     Rumsfeld, speaking about our national missile defense system \n     on the Lehrer NewsHour earlier this year, said that a system \n     would not have to be 90 or even 80 percent effective, but \n     only 70 percent effective. Secretary Rumsfeld, in referring \n     to a, quote, ``0.7 success rate,'' said, and I quote, \n     ``That's plenty.''\n       Folks, 30 percent failure for any national defense system \n     could be called plenty of things, but plenty successful is \n     not one of them. Think about it.\n       (Applause)\n       Let's say President Richard Ryan becomes president of the \n     United States. And the head of a rogue state tells him, which \n     is how the scenario goes, ``I'm invading my neighborhood \n     today. And if you try to stop me, I'll fire my ICBMs at \n     you.'' Never mind that he won't do that because he knows he'd \n     be annihilated within a matter of 30 minutes. But President \n     Ryan turns to his national security adviser, as I always do, \n     Carl Wiser, and says, ``Carl, what do I do?''\n       And Carl says, ``Don't worry, we have a missile defense \n     system. And unlike Rumsfeld's 0.7, ours is 0.9 effective.''\n\n[[Page S7381]]\n\n       President Ryan says, ``Oh. There's a 10 percent chance then \n     of losing Detroit?''\n       And Carl says, ``Well that depends. If they fire seven \n     missiles, the odds of losing at least one city will be 50-50. \n     Because guess what: 0.9 means that not 90 percent fired will \n     get through, 0.9 means that for every missile fired, that \n     single missile has a nine out of 10 chance of getting \n     through. You get to seven, it's about a 50-50 chance that one \n     gets through. If you do the 0.7, you fire two missiles, \n     there's an equal chance one is going to get through.''\n       So now President Ryan says, ``You know, these guys that \n     designed this system are right. This enables me to not be \n     blackmailed. I'm supposed to feel like I have freedom of \n     action thanks to this defense.''\n       And Carl says, ``Hey look, Rumsfeld told Jim Lehrer that 70 \n     percent effectiveness would be enough, at least initially. \n     And with that system there's a 50-50 chance of losing at \n     least one city if that rogue state fires two missiles. We're \n     better off than we were.''\n       And I assume that this scenario which they lay out means, \n     where Ryan is president, he's going to say, ``You know, I \n     really have some flexibility now. I'm only going to lose \n     Detroit or San Francisco or Cleveland or Dallas, so I can \n     really move here with dispatch. I've got flexibility. I don't \n     have upon deterrence.''\n       Now, I know you think I'm being a wise guy here, but \n     sometimes it's useful to reduce this complex nuclear \n     theological discussion to reality. If I'm president, does \n     that give me more flexibility?\n       Does that allow me to say, ``I'm only going to lose one or \n     two population centers, therefore I have more flexibility to \n     do anything other than say, `If you do, we will annihilate \n     you'?''\n       I also find it fascinating, this whole premise is based \n     upon the notion that defense no longer works. Deterrence no \n     longer works.\n       Now, I say this, and there's a television audience \n     listening: Help educate me. Name me a time in the last 500 \n     years when the leader of a nation-state has said, ``I know I \n     face virtual annihilation if I take the following action, but \n     I'm go ahead, and I'm going to do it anyway.''\n       Saddam Hussein, the certifiable maniac--when George I said \n     to him, ``If you do we will take you out,'' what did he do \n     with 500,000 forces marching on Baghdad? He had those Scud \n     missiles everybody talks about as a justification for \n     building the system. He had chemical weapons. He had \n     biological weapons. Why did he not use them if deterrence \n     does not work?\n       I just find the basic premise upon which this whole \n     argument rests and the sense of urgency a little wanting. \n     Think about it. We will have spent potentially up to a half a \n     trillion dollars for a system that might work nine out of 10 \n     times, assuming the administration knows how to build it, \n     that, one, won't give the president the freedom of action.\n       One, that won't give the Pentagon what it really needs, \n     won't modernize our conventional forces, and without being \n     able to say, ``Yes, we've saved Social Security for even one \n     more day.'' That's the system we're going to build.\n       Remember now, folks, they don't know what it looks like, \n     they don't even have it on paper, they have tested a system \n     in one mode that, God bless our incredible technology, it \n     worked, and I vote to pay for them to continue to do that \n     research. But they're willing to pull out of an ABM Treaty \n     that sends the signal to the rest of the world the end of \n     arms control has arrived. And what protection do we have in \n     the near term, let alone down the road?\n       Sure, we'll do all we can to defend ourselves against any \n     threat, nobody denies that, but even the Joint Chiefs says \n     that a strategic nuclear attack is less likely than a \n     regional conflict, a major theater war, terrorist attacks at \n     home or abroad, or any number of other real issues. We'll \n     have diverted all that money to address the least likely \n     threat, while the real threat comes to this country in the \n     hold of a ship, the belly of a plane, or smuggled into a city \n     in the middle of the night in a vial in a backpack.\n       And I ask you, you want to do us damage, are you more \n     likely to send a missile you're not sure can reach us with a \n     biological or chemical weapon because you don't have the \n     throw weight to put a nuclear weapon on it and no one's \n     anticipating that in the near term, with a return address \n     saying, ``It came from us, here's where we are?'' Or are you \n     more likely to put somebody with a backpack crossing the \n     border from Vancouver down to Seattle, or coming up the New \n     York Harbor with a rusty old ship with an atom bomb sitting \n     in the hull? Which are you more likely to do? And what \n     defense do we have against those other things?\n       Watch these hearings we're about to have. We don't have, as \n     the testimony showed, a public health infrastructure to deal \n     with the existing pathogens that are around now. We don't \n     have the investment, the capability to identify or deal with \n     an anthrax attack. We do not have, as Ambassador to Japan \n     now, Howard Baker, and his committee said, the ability to \n     curtail the availability of chemical weapons lying around the \n     Soviet Union, the former Soviet Union and Russia, because \n     they don't know what to do with it.\n       They showed us a report where they showed us photographs of \n     things that look like large outhouses, clapboard buildings, \n     with no windows and padlocks on the door, that have as many \n     chemical weapons in that building to destroy the bulk of the \n     East Coast--and we're not spending the money to help them \n     corral and destroy that in the name of this search? The cost \n     estimate was $30 billion over 10 years in this bipartisan \n     commission, and it was listed as the most urgent threat to \n     the United States of America.\n       The truth is, technology will keep outpacing our capacity \n     to build an effective system, which may well be obsolete or \n     penetrable by the time it's done. And that means we'll \n     continually increase our capability, and in turn, so will \n     those who are trying to penetrate it. And so the new arms \n     race begins.\n       Forty-nine Nobel Prize-winning scientists sent a letter to \n     President Clinton last year opposing the deployment of the \n     limited antiballistic missile system the president was \n     contemplating, and I'll quote from the letter. Quote: ``The \n     system would offer little protection, would do grave harm to \n     this nation's core security interest,'' end of quote.\n       They went on to say, and I quote--these are now, we're \n     talking about 49 Nobel laureates--``We and other independent \n     scientists have long argued that antiballistic missile \n     systems, particularly those attempting to intercept reentry \n     vehicles in space, will inevitably lose in an arms race of \n     improvements in offensive capability.''\n       That night in 1989 when the wall came down and we wondered \n     where it would lead, another arms race was the furthest thing \n     from any of our minds. The idea that our allies would \n     question our commitment and our resolve, even our motives, \n     was unthinkable.\n       Our place in the world seemed secure. The world was looking \n     to us to demonstrate leadership, and it still is.\n       Let's think about how we felt that night. The feeling that \n     something good was happening and something even better was on \n     the horizon. It was as if the world had awoken from a long, \n     bad dream into a new era in which old values and old \n     prejudices would no longer prevail, and new values and new \n     ideals, wherever they were to be found, would be found and \n     make us all more secure.\n       Folks, let's not now raise the starting gun on a new arm's \n     race that is sure, I promise you, to make my children and my \n     grandchildren and these students assembled here feel less \n     secure than we feel today.\n       Thank you very much for listening.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. On September 10, the day before the attacks on the towers, \nI made a speech to the National Press Club where I warned about a \nmassive attack on the United States of America from terrorists; why I \nthought it would happen and why I thought our priorities were \nmisplaced--the day before 9/11. I had no knowledge of 9/11, but I have \nbeen working in this field, like my colleagues on the floor, for 30 \nyears. There was an inevitability to it. But we did nothing.\n  I feel like we are in that same ``Alice in Wonderland'' suspension \nwhen it comes to rail. It is either it is so big you can't protect \neverything so don't protect anything--like it was before. Our country \nis so big and so open there is nothing much we can do about terror. And \nthe second subparagraph before 9/11 was: By the way, it is not likely \nto happen here.\n  Why? Why is it not likely to happen here?\n  There is $250 million to be allocated to general security upgrades \nfor freight rail operations. That includes things like putting cameras \nin freight yards so you have somebody watching who is wandering around \nthose yards and maybe sticking something up underneath 90-ton chlorine \ngas tanker cars or putting in a boxcar a dirty bomb, a home-made \nweapon.\n  It also provides $65 million to go specifically to Amtrak security \nupgrades for hiring officers. We had an interesting thing. We have a \nrelatively small number of officers on Amtrak. If you go from here to \nfly out of Reagan Airport, if you go out of Dulles or Reagan Airport or \nthe Philadelphia airport or LaGuardia or Newark or L.A. or O'Hare or \nAtlanta, you are going to go through, en route to your gate, probably \nas many security officers, including the folks inspecting your bags, as \nexist in all of Amtrak.\n\n  Did you hear me? Let me say that again.\n  I guarantee you that going through the screening area you are going \nto run into not just the people looking at you in the area you go \nthrough, but you are likely to run into more TSA screeners than exist \nin any one station in the United States of America.\n  I received a note indicating that I am needed urgently. If I could \nsuspend for a minute and come back and pick up where I left off, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  (Ms. Murkowski assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, rather than suggesting a quorum, I will \nprotect the Senator's position.\n  Does the Senator have a modification to his amendment?\n\n[[Page S7382]]\n\n                    Amendment No. 4585, as Modified\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I do. I have a modification of amendment No. 4585.\n  The amendment will remain intact with the following added at the \nbottom which says ``except in Alaska, far Northwest, and far Northeast \nContinental United States of America.''\n  I want to be clear that the Record show what that means; that is, \nthey can dismantle LORAN everywhere except there. And that would \nprotect specifically Nantucket, Caribou, George, and all six in Alaska. \nThe study would still go forward for those areas only, not for the rest \nof the country. The dismantling of these areas that are not used would \nbe able to continue as the administration and the Federal Radio \nNavigational Plan suggests.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be accepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is so \nmodified.\n  The amendment (No. 4585), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       After section 539, insert the following:\n       Sec. 540. None of the amounts available or otherwise \n     available to the Coast Guard under title II of this Act under \n     the heading ``United States Coast Guard'' under the heading \n     ``operating expenses'' may be obligated or expended for the \n     continuation of operations at Long Range Aids to Navigation \n     (LORAN) stations nationwide, except in Alaska, far northwest, \n     and far northeast continental United States of America.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I say to my friend, I do support his \namendment now as amended to preserve the rights of people who currently \nrely on the LORAN-C--the LORAN system, not just the LORAN-C.\n  Thank you very much.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, is that amendment pending?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is not pending.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment offered by the Senator from Delaware be set aside and the \namendment which has just been modified be pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Unless there is objection, I ask unanimous consent that \namendment be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4585), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam American, I thank the chairman and ranking member \nfor the acceptance of the amendments today and the cordial way in which \nthey have worked with us. I appreciate it very much.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4553\n\n  Madam President, is the regular order the admendment proposed by the \nSenator from Delaware?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Biden amendment.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I thank my colleagues. I apologize. It \nwas an unusual request--an urgent message which turned out not to be \nurgent. I apologize.\n  The point I was making is $65 million goes specifically to Amtrak \nsecurity upgrades. Specifically, things such as hiring officers, \nincreasing K9 patrols, increasing fencing, lighting, and cameras in \nareas where the security experts indicate they are badly needed.\n  There is $100 million for R I will not take the time of the Senate \nto go into any of the ways in which to deal with tunnels and innovative \nways to deal with detection of chemicals, et cetera, and biological \nagents.\n  Before I close, I would like to point out a very troubling problem \nrelating to rail police which this amendment addresses. We are all \naware of the problems that this agency faces due to budget shortfalls. \nIn particular, the police force is woefully inadequate for the job it \nis assigned to do. The amendment would add 200 Amtrak police officers \nand will provide a 25-percent salary increase for existing officers.\n  You ask: Why is that the case? This funding is critical because the \nAmtrak police department cannot pay anything remotely approaching the \ncompetitive wage rate of other police officers. This contributes to an \nincredibly high turnover.\n  An entry-level Amtrak police officer makes only $31,000 with a \nmaximum, no matter how long he or she stays on the force and no matter \nwhat responsibility, of $51,000. By contrast, a Boston police \ndepartment entry-level officer makes $49,000, and a U.S. Capitol Police \nofficer entry level makes $46,746.\n  This presents a problem with recruiting and turnover.\n  Between 1997 and 2003, Amtrak lost 190 of its officers, with only 20 \npercent to retirement, and hired only 184. As a result, Amtrak has only \n300 officers in the entire system nationwide, 20 percent below its \ninadequate authorized level.\n  I have been working with the Amtrak police department and the \nFraternal Order of Police for some time to address the disparity.\n  This amendment sets aside $25 million to add 200 police officers and \ngives existing officers a 25-percent pay raise. And still they will not \nbe competitive enough relative to other agencies.\n  This funding is critical. We have neglected rail security since 9/11, \nand we have had wake-up call after wake-up call.\n  This year, just as last year, our strong ally has experienced a \ndeadly attack at the same time we are addressing homeland security \nappropriations at home. I pray to God that next year, as we address \nthis, we are not responding to what might happen to our rail system.\n  When are we going to wake up?\n  I would like to draw attention to the 9/11 Commission's report card \nissued this past December.\n  I think it was December 5. Don't hold me to that exactly, but it was \nin December. It found, in respect to our Nation's critical \ninfrastructure, the following:\n\n       No risk and vulnerability assessments have actually been \n     made, no national priorities established, no recommendations \n     made on the allocation of scarce resources, and all key \n     decisions are at least 1 year away.\n\n  It is time that we stop talking about priorities and actually set \nthem.\n  With this amendment, we establish rail security as a priority.\n  I urge my colleagues to finally, for Lord's sake, deal with this. At \nany one moment today in New York City, there will be, in an aluminum \ntube in a tunnel underneath that city or standing on a platform, over \n20,000 people. How many people are on a 747--500, 600? I don't know the \nnumber, but 20,000 people in a relatively confined space at any one \ntime sitting in aluminum tubes in tunnels where there is virtually no \nprotection--and standing on platforms. We all go to New York. Go on up \nthere and look at Penn Station. Get off the train. Walk around and tell \nme how many police officers you identify. You will find more in your \nhometown.\n  We have to do something.\n  I thank my colleagues for listening to me once again. I hope I will \nnot make this speech again next year as a consequence of another \nserious rail attack. I pray to God it is not at home.\n  I yield the floor. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, the Senator from Delaware makes a strong \nand effective case for the need of stronger rail security. He puts it \nin the context of what is happening in other nations, what has happened \nin England or what happened yesterday in India. There is no question--\nand the most recent instance that was potentially here in the United \nStates involving New York. There can be no question but that rail is a \nthreatened infrastructure and a target of opportunity.\n  The problem with his amendment is, as he knows, we are constricted by \ncertain rules that we have in allocation. We funded rail security at \nmore than we funded last year--not a lot more and certainly nowhere \nnear what the Senator from Delaware has asked for.\n  But we have used up all the allocation to take care of what we \nconsider to be appropriate needs that have to be addressed--threat \nissues, mass destruction, border security, and things we have already \ndiscussed.\n  His amendment, as it is structured, would add $1 billion on top of \nwhat we have received as an annual allocation, which means that it \nwould break other allocations, exceed the agreed-to number, and that is \nsomething we can't do.\n  As much as I recognize the legitimacy of many of the points he makes, \nI think it is, however, important to put in context what is happening \nin rail.\n  The number in this bill--and we have about $187 million for rail \nsecurity--is not the only commitment to rail. In fact, if you look at \nthe amendment that the Senator from Delaware has\n\n[[Page S7383]]\n\nput forward, a big chunk of the money, I think, goes to tunnel security \nor other construction. We talked about it quite a bit. Amtrak and the \nnortheast corridor, which is Amtrak, gets its funding through another \nsubcommittee. That subcommittee has, in its appropriation, a lot of \nmoney for Amtrak. In fact, it has $770 million for capital improvement \nwhich can be used for tunnel security.\n  It has $440 million, I believe, for operating costs which can be used \nfor security. That comes through a different committee. And it is \navailable for many of the things which these dollars would be used for.\n  In addition, I think it is important to note how our priorities are \nset by States and communities which have a large amount of rail and get \nthe funds which we give them with great flexibility to be used to \naddress threat. We distribute billions of dollars under this bill and \nthe prior homeland security bills to major urban areas, especially \nalong the northeast corridor. Those funds go out on the basis of \nthreat. And communities such as New York, Washington, Baltimore, \nBoston, and Philadelphia have the opportunity to use those funds for \nrail security, if they wish to. But what we have seen from these \ncommunities is that they don't prioritize rail security at that level. \nThey use it for other things.\n  For example, in 2005, of the grants that went to States and to \ncommunities, they spent only 2 percent of their discretionary pool on \nrail security; in New York, a little more, 12 percent. But on average, \nit was 2 percent.\n  The State of Washington actually was the most aggressive. They spent \n29 percent of theirs on transportation security. In the largest urban \nareas, the average has been around 8 percent. Communities which have \nthe opportunity to make the choice, do we put it into our subway \nsystems and bus systems or do we put it into some other area where we \nsee threat, we have decided that their commitment will be at this \nfairly small level of the overall dollars that are available. But the \ndollars are there in rather large sums--literally billions of dollars--\nand $5 billion approximately is still in the pipeline which could be \nused in these areas. There are other resources that can go toward rail.\n\n  Those that are specific, such as the Amtrak funding that will come \nthrough for capital improvement, $770 million out of the Transportation \nbill or the operating account, which is $440 million, or those which \nare more general but could be reallocated toward rail, which are the \ncity and State discretionary funds. So there is money and a lot of it \nthat is available to move in this direction and address these needs.\n  Assume for the moment there is not enough, which is the argument of \nthe Senator from Delaware. I am willing to accept that more money could \ncertainly be used in this area. What is the way we should approach \nthis? It is not to break the cap. It is, rather, to tie it to a fee \nsystem, much as we have done with the airlines.\n  The Senator from Delaware mentioned the airlines. We have a \ntransportation fee in the airline system, which essentially funds the \nTSA activities which involve a lot of capital activities in the area of \nairport security and obviously all the personnel. There are 22 million \npeople who ride Amtrak. If you put a $5 transportation fee on their \ntickets, which is about the same as the airline fee, that would \ngenerate almost exactly the amount of money the Senator from Delaware \nis requesting.\n  If the Senator wanted to bring his amendment back with that type of a \nfee system which would allow for the extra money and then allocate it \nthe way he is suggesting it be allocated, rather than these other \nsources of revenue, I could agree to that, potentially. But in its \npresent form as a cap buster, as a budget buster--because it takes the \ntop off the appropriations bill--we cannot agree to this.\n  It is not that we do not feel there aren't needs there. There are \nneeds there, but we feel there are other sources to fund those needs. \nWe feel we make a strong commitment, relative to rail in this bill in \nthe context of what has been done historically, and to the extent the \nSenator from Delaware feels an even stronger commitment has to be made \nbeyond what Amtrak and cities and towns have as discretionary funds and \nbeyond the $187 million in this bill, should do it the same way we are \ndoing it with TSA, which is to use a fee system. Those are our \nthoughts.\n  It is subject to a point of order because it is $1 billion over the \nbudget and would essentially blow the 302(b) cap. At the proper time, I \nwill make that point of order, unless it is amended.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator permit me to respond, briefly?\n  Mr. GREGG. The floor is the Senator's.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I ask unanimous consent Senator Clinton be added as a \ncosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, let me deal with a piece at a time, to \nthe cogent arguments my friend from New Hampshire has made and thank \nhim for the acknowledgment that there may be a need to do more on rail.\n  First of all, I find the whole debate about homeland security, which \nis beyond the purview of this debate, somewhat fascinating. The 9/11 \nCommission tells us we should be spending over $42 billion over the \nnext 5 years to deal with what they believe and identify as serious \nthreats which are woefully inadequate, where they give the mark to the \nCongress and the Senate of a D or an F, in terms of how they grade the \narea of concern. We are $42 billion behind the curve to begin with.\n  I find the argument, by the way, a little akin to the argument my \nfriend from New Hampshire just made, a little akin to the false \nargument about whether, of $740 million allocated in the last round, \nthere should be a 40-percent cut in money for New York and Washington \nto be sent to St. Louis and Omaha. The question isn't whether it should \nhave been cut to be sent to Omaha, the money is needed in New York and \nOmaha and in St. Louis.\n  The debate should be, why are we only spending, in that allocation, \n$740 million? The single most primary and primitive function of \nGovernment is to protect its citizens, to physically protect them. In \nmy view, it comes before civil rights, civil liberties. It comes before \neducation. It comes before health care. If you are not safe in your \nhome, safe in your street, safe in your Nation, the rest of it does not \nmatter a whole lot.\n  So we get into a false debate. Take Amtrak, all the money in Amtrak, \n$740 million for capital expenditures. That $740 million for capital \nexpenditures still leaves Amtrak about $4.5 billion behind on capital \nneeds. What are we talking about? Rail maintenance, rail improvement, \nthe catenary wire above it, the actual cars, the actual engines that \nhave to be upgraded. We have forced Amtrak, by underfunding so badly \nfor so long, to cannibalize its own system in order to be able to pay \nsalaries to keep the trains operating. There is no money.\n  It is a little bit similar to my saying, in the education budget, \nthere is a whole lot of money there in order to be able to provide for \neliminating the additional cost of the loans to college students \nbecause the education budget has X number of dollars. That means you \nhave to go cut something out of education that is already underfunded.\n  I find it to be a false argument.\n  The point about the basis of the threat, I know of no other area \nwhere there has been as many consistent, specific threat assessments \nmade by the FBI, by the CIA, by our intelligence agencies than rail. I \nmay be mistaken, but I am happy to stand corrected if I am wrong. The \nthreat is there.\n  Lastly, TSA does not pay for the doors on the aircraft. We still \nspend billions and billions of direct dollars in taxpayers' money. \nAgain, it sounds good but irrelevant.\n  The arguments are very well made and very irrelevant. We are still \nonly spending about $150 million.\n  You say: Well, the States have this money. What have they chosen to \ndo? Guess what. How much money have the States had to spend on airport \nsecurity when they choose that? The Federal Government has come in and \ntaken on th lion's share of that responsibility. I am confused. Why \ndoes Reagan Airport, which has fewer people visiting every day, have a \nhigher priority than Union Station? I don't get that. I don't \nunderstand that.\n\n[[Page S7384]]\n\n  The bottom line is, we do not have the commitment to deal with this. \nI acknowledge, as the chairman of the subcommittee, my friend gets an \nallocation. But, again, that is a false argument. It is true he gets an \nallocation. Why is the allocation not bigger? The allocation is not \nbigger because our priorities in this country are backward.\n  Let me give one example, and I realize it is just one. About a month \nago, we had the six major oil companies before the Judiciary Committee. \nDuring that time, the chairman, Republican Chairman Senator Specter--\nand the issue was price gouging--swore all six CEOs in under oath. \nEveryone asked about price gouging.\n  It got my turn in the order of asking questions, and I said I would \nlike to not ask about price gouging, I would like to ask you about tax \nbreaks. You have an Energy bill last year that I voted against, that, \nat a minimum, there are $2.5 billion worth of tax breaks to encourage \nyou to explore. I looked at the chairman of the board of ExxonMobil. I \nam paraphrasing, and I will later in the day come back with the actual \nrecord of that exchange and ask it be printed in the Record at that \ntime. I said: You made $35 billion in profits. My mother would say: God \nlove you, that is wonderful. I am not arguing about your profit. That \nis great. Do you need any of the $2.5 billion per year you are going to \nget? He put his head down, if you take a look at the film. I said: Sir, \nyou are under oath. And he looked up and he said: No, we don't need it. \nI said: Good. And I went down the list of the other five oil \nexecutives. Do you need it? No, no, no, no, no.\n  Then I asked another question. I'm going to propose to eliminate that \ntax cut, and I am going to use it for homeland security. Do you object \nto that? Would you support it? I said: You are under oath. The CEO of \nExxonMobil said: I would support it. They all supported it.\n  So $2.5 billion we are wasting--wasting--in giving energy breaks to \noil companies.\n  I say to my colleagues, parenthetically, you do not hear me stand up \nhere and demagog. I am happy they are making all that money. But they \nacknowledge they do not need it. For $2.5 billion, we could restore my \nentire COPS Program, which we have eliminated. We could add 1,000 more \nFBI agents to deal with homegrown terrorism. We could fund every penny \nof this.\n  I realize, as the joke goes, that is above my friend's pay grade. It \nis not his responsibility. But we get put in these positions where guys \nsuch as me vote against budget priorities that are set, allocations are \nlimited, and, understandably, under the rule, we are then put in a \nposition of points of order.\n  I respectfully suggest that if anyone said: What should be the \npriorities of this Nation and how much money should we be spending to \nprotect the American people, my guess is a whole lot of things, \nincluding some social programs, would come after a basic fundamental \nrequirement to protect the American people from what we are told is a \nreasonable probability that it will happen.\n  I accept everything my friend said in terms of the caps, et cetera. I \nacknowledge this, in fact, would be subject to a point of order. I find \nit frustrating I am consistently left in the position of having to \nargue. It is a little bit similar to what we used to do in local \noffice. You cut the budget, and we would make the hearing impaired \ncompete with the physically impaired, who compete with the blind, for \nthe limited amount of money we gave them. We would say: We cannot use \nmore money for the hearing impaired because within this allocation we \ndo not have enough money. We will have to cut it from someone else or \ngo find it somewhere else. That is how I feel.\n  I apologize for my frustration. The record will show, although when I \nspeak in the Senate someone suggests I am mildly energized about what I \nspeak about, I don't often rise in the Senate to speak.\n  Folks, we are going to regret this. We are going to regret this.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent at 2 p.m. today \nthe Senate proceed to a vote on the motion to waive the budget with \nrespect to the Biden amendment No. 4553, with no amendments in order to \nthe amendment prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

If there are other people who wish to bring amendments over \nprior to the 2 o'clock vote, we would be happy to hear from them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, maybe this has already been done, but I \nask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, the amendment I offer is something I feel \nvery strongly about. A threat to America's energy security is a threat \nto our national security. Our dependence upon OPEC and foreign oil \nentangles us in the Middle East and makes us dependent on countries \nthat are hostile to America and to American interests. The greater \nAmerica's dependence upon foreign energy, the greater the threat to \nAmerican national security.\n  Two decades ago, America alone drove the world's economy. We had \nWestern Europe as competitors, but our economy was clearly on top and \nunchallenged. But things have changed. Right now, China is growing at \nabout 10 percent a year in GDP. That is almost three times the rate of \ngrowth here in America. They do not have 300 million citizens; they \nhave over a billion. People in that growth rate create an incredibly \nstrong economy with serious economic demands; and one of those demands \nis oil.\n  China is not alone. India is also growing at a double-digit rate. \nThey, too, are a huge economy. And both countries are expanding their \nmanufacturing, expanding their technology, and, therefore, expanding \ntheir demand for oil.\n  The challenge for American consumers and, frankly, for American \nindustry is that the supply of oil has not kept up with the demand for \noil. When you have an essential economic commodity, and you are not \nproducing a sufficient supply, then prices tend to go up, which is what \nwe see happening across the country today. We are all fighting for the \nsame gallon of oil. Until that changes, either we will need to increase \nsupply or we are going to face higher prices.\n  In my view, the long-term strategy and solution is to power our \nautomobiles with something other than gasoline. Technology is the way \nto help change America for the better. Years of investment in fuels \nsuch as ethanol have put us on the threshold of major breakthroughs. \nThose breakthroughs are becoming a reality for consumers here in this \ncountry.\n  In my home State, the community of Aberdeen, SD, is, right now, \nselling E85 fuel for under $2 a gallon when other fuel prices are going \nfor $3 a gallon and sometimes higher because they have an abundant \nsupply of ethanol. It is produced locally, and the fuel retailers have \nmade the investment to install the tanks. That is the very thing we \nwant to see happen in other places across this country because American \nconsumers and Congress realize we have to do more to reduce our \ndependence upon foreign sources of energy.\n  The amendment I am offering would significantly help in providing \nalternatives for the American consumer while lessening our dependence \nupon foreign oil. This amendment, very simply, would allow station \nowners around this country to be reimbursed for 30 percent--not \nexceeding $30,000--of the expenses related to the purchase and \ninstallation of alternative refueling systems.\n  This amendment provides partial reimbursement for eligible \nalternative refueling systems, such as E85--which, I mentioned, is \nsomething we are starting to see more of in my State--biodiesel, \nnatural gas, compressed natural gas, liquefied natural gas, liquefied \npetroleum gas, hydrogen, and other alternative fuels as defined by the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency. This amendment utilized penalties that \nare primarily paid by foreign automakers who violate CAFE standards. \nLast year, these penalties generated about $20 million. It will \ncomplement the growing number of alternative fueled vehicles across our \ncountry, protect the environment, and allow our country to reduce its \ndependence upon foreign sources of oil.\n  The car companies in this country have announced recently they are \ngoing to double the number of flex-fuel vehicles they are going to put \non the roads here in the future. If you look at already what we have on \nthe roads today, there are more than 5 million flexible-fuel vehicles \non the road that can run on either E85 or regular gasoline. However, \nthe problem is that we have 180,000 gas stations across this country \nand only 800 currently offer E85 ethanol. In short, this means that \nless than 1 percent of all stations in America today offer E85 as an \nalternative.\n  The average cost of purchasing and installing an E85 refueling system \nis approximately $40,000 to $200,000, depending on the geographic area \nand the size of the tank. Ethanol production is at an all-time high of \n4.5 billion gallons per year. Nationwide, there are currently 103 \nplants producing ethanol, with 35 more under construction. Those 35 \nadditional plants will add an additional 2.3 billion gallons of ethanol \nproduction by next year. The Energy Policy Act, passed last year, \nrequires the annual use of 7.5 billion gallons of alternative fuel by \nthe year 2012.\n  The amendment is very straightforward. It acknowledges the fact we \nhave auto manufacturers who are producing more and more automobiles \nthat are capable of using alternative sources of fuel such as E85. It \nacknowledges the fact that we have production in this country going, \nwith 2.3 billion additional gallons becoming available this year of \nethanol. And it also acknowledges there is a consumer out there in the \ncountry today who is looking not only to get the very best possible \nprice per gallon for the fuel they put in their vehicle, but also to do \nsomething about the long-term problem that faces this country; that is, \nthis enormous appetite for oil that furthers our dependence upon \nforeign sources of energy.\n  What we need in this country is American energy and American \nindependence so we do not have to worry about getting all that fuel, \nall that oil, from places outside the United States that are hostile to \nthis country and to American interests.\n  This is about energy independence. It is about closing that \ndistribution gap, so that now that we have the supply, we have the \ndemand for ethanol, that we have the fuel retailers in this country \nmoving in a way, putting policies in place, that would make it possible \nfor them economically to install the very pumps that would provide the \nfuel that is being increasingly demanded by American consumers and \nwhich those in the ethanol industry in this country are continually \ngearing up, in terms of production, to meet.\n\n  So this is a very straightforward amendment. It applies to this \nparticular piece of legislation, I believe, for a lot of reasons, one \nof which is, as\n\n[[Page S7386]]\n\nI said earlier, it is a very, very clear and established connection \nthat a threat to America's energy security is a threat to our national \nsecurity.\n  We talk about protecting our homeland and making sure America is safe \nand secure going forward for future generations. A key component in \nthat debate ought to be: What steps are we taking as a nation, what \npolicies are we putting in place that will enable our country to become \nenergy independent, to have American energy meet the needs and the \ndemands that our economy has to grow in this country?\n  So, Madam President, I offer this amendment to this legislation. \nThere are others who I believe are interested in this issue. I \nintroduced a bill that is very similar to this amendment. I have made \nsome slight modifications to it, which was cosponsored by Members on \nboth sides of the aisle, Republicans and Democrats. A similar bill is \ncalendared for action in the House of Representatives.\n  I believe it is high time as a nation, as a U.S. Senate, that we put \nas a priority getting away from that dependence upon foreign sources of \nenergy, having an abundant supply of an American energy, so we can \nprovide the supply that is necessary to fuel our economy, keep it \ngrowing, keep it strong, and make sure that it is affordable for \nAmerican consumers.\n  Madam President, at this point I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be laid aside, and I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Vitter] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4615.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit the confiscation of a firearm during an emergency \n or major disaster if the possession of such firearm is not prohibited \n                      under Federal or State law)\n\n       On page 127, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 540. PROHIBITION ON CONFISCATION OF FIREARMS.\n\n       None of the funds appropriated by this Act may be used to \n     temporarily or permanently seize any firearm during an \n     emergency or major disaster (as those terms are defined in \n     section 102 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and \n     Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5122)) if the possession \n     of such firearm is not prohibited under Federal or State law, \n     other than for forfeiture in compliance with Federal or State \n     law or as evidence in a criminal investigation.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, this involves gun confiscation during \nmajor disasters or emergencies. My amendment is very simple and \nstraightforward. It would prevent any sort of confiscation of legally \nheld guns protected by the second amendment during major disasters or \nemergencies.\n  In the wake of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, local and Federal law \nenforcement officials were overwhelmed in many ways by the tragedy that \nunfolded. That is understandable. During the chaos, a criminal element \ntook advantage of the tragedy and started to commit serious crimes \nagainst persons and property. In many cases, law-abiding citizens took \naction and defended their property and themselves through the \nconstitutionally guaranteed second amendment right to bear arms.\n  There is probably no more important or significant moment in normal, \neveryday American life where that second amendment right meant \nsomething. In some cases, it was literally the difference between a \nlaw-abiding citizen's life or death and between that citizen's ability \nto protect his property or have it completely taken away. Yet in the \nmidst of that situation, where that constitutionally guaranteed right \nwas so important, even far more important than in an everyday \nsituation--although it is certainly crucial then--certain law \nenforcement authorities confiscated legally held firearms by law-\nabiding citizens. Not a few, not a dozen, not two dozen, but literally \nthousands were confiscated by law enforcement officials.\n  In fact, even well after the hurricanes, the Federal court ordered \nthe city of New Orleans to return all guns unlawfully seized during \nHurricane Katrina. Even after all that, the New Orleans police \nsuperintendent, Warren Riley, stated in a June 6 radio interview that \nhis officers would confiscate guns again if another similar disaster \nshould strike New Orleans.\n  This is ridiculous and should not be tolerated. We are talking about \na constitutionally protected second amendment right. And even more so, \nwe are talking about a situation where those rights are vitally \nimportant for the law-abiding citizen when the police are not there and \nare unavailable, when there is no phone service, and literally that \ncitizen's second amendment right is the key to protecting his own life, \nhis family, and their property.\n  I am proud to say that in Louisiana, our State legislature acted on \nthis issue, as I am attempting to do today. In June of this year, in \ntime for the new hurricane season, a law was passed to clarify that the \nemergency powers granted to the Governor and to local officials ``do \nnot authorize the seizure or confiscation of a firearm, weapon or \nammunition from any individual if the firearm, weapon or ammunition is \nbeing possessed or used lawfully.''\n  I am supportive of that action by the State legislature. It was \nsigned into law by the Governor. Unfortunately, there is still room for \nFederal authorities to act inconsistent with that. That is the problem \nand the issue and challenge I want to solve. My amendment is very \nsimple and straightforward. It is a limitation of funds saying that no \nFederal funds in this act can be used to temporarily or permanently \nseize any firearm during an emergency or major disaster, if the \npossession of such firearm is not prohibited under Federal or State \nlaw. The amendment also allows for the forfeiture of firearms in \ncompliance with Federal or State law or as evidence in a criminal \ninvestigation.\n  I hope this will be noncontroversial, that all Senators will accept \nthe amendment as an important, commonsense clarification of the law and \nwhat the law certainly should be.\n  I understand our law enforcement officers are under intense pressure \nin these extreme situations following a major disaster or a major \nemergency. But particularly in those situations, when their services, \nquite frankly, are unavailable to the populace as under normal times, \nwhen all communication is shut down, officers should not be \nconfiscating legal firearms from law-abiding citizens protected under \nthe second amendment.\n  That is the nature of my amendment. I ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing Senators be added as cosponsors of the amendment: Senators \nInhofe, Enzi, Thune, Burns, Brownback, Martinez, Domenici, and Gregg.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thune). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. VITTER. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n[[Page S7388]]\n\n  Mr. BYRD. I ask unanimous consent my name be added as a cosponsor to \nSenator Vitter's amendment No. 4615.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4620\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I shall offer an amendment to strengthen \nchemical facility security.\n  As Yogi Berra once said, ``this is like deja vu all over again.'' \nThis is the fourth appropriations bill for the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, and every summer, I have offered an amendment to provide \nincentives to the chemical sector to secure their facilities by \nestablishing a chemical security grant program.\n  Unfortunately, at every turn, the administration opposed my \namendments and those amendments were defeated. The administration \nclaimed that it was partnering with the chemical sector and that they \nwere doing enough to secure their facilities.\n  In my State of West Virginia, there are 73 chemical manufacturing \nplants and 100 chemical distribution plants. If there were an attack on \none or more of those facilities, the potential loss of human life and \ndamage to the local and national economy would be devastating. The same \ncan be said for facilities in New Jersey, New York, Texas, Michigan, \nCalifornia, Pennsylvania, and many other States.\n  The Department of Homeland Security's National Strategy for Securing \nthe Chemical Sector states that ``the value of the sector to the \nNation, as well as the potentially high consequences associated with \nsome chemical facilities, make the Chemical Sector a potentially \nattractive target for terrorists.''\n  Despite the multitude of warnings that the chemical sector is \nvulnerable to attack, including its own warnings, the administration \nhas shown a great reluctance to make security at chemical facilities a \npriority.\n  Last year, the Government Accountability Office concluded that for 93 \npercent of the chemical industry, it is uncertain whether facilities \nare improving security at all. Only 1,100 of the 15,000 chemical \nfacilities identified by the Department of Homeland Security are known \nto adhere to voluntary industry security procedures.\n  The Environmental Protection Agency reports that 123 chemical plants \nlocated throughout the Nation could each potentially expose more than a \nmillion people if a chemical release were to occur.\n  I was encouraged last summer when the DHS Assistant Secretary for \nInfrastructure Protection and Information Security testified before \nCongress that a system to enforce and audit security standards must be \nput in place for the chemical sector. Unfortunately, no action has been \ntaken since his testimony.\n  This year, in its National Strategy to Secure the Chemical Sector, \nDHS says, ``legislation that would provide the Department of Homeland \nSecurity with overarching regulatory authority for the Chemical Sector \nsecurity should be enacted.'' If the administration were serious about \nchemical security, it would have submitted legislation to back up this \ntough talk. Yet, the administration has not submitted such legislation. \nNor has it played an active role in encouraging the congressional \nleadership to work with the various committees with an interest in this \nmatter to resolve their differences and bring a bill to the floor. This \nmorning, the administration submitted its statement of administration \npolicy on the bill that is before the Senate, and once again the \nadministration is silent on this matter. For the life of me, I do not \nunderstand why this administration does not take securing our chemical \nfacilities seriously.\n  I applaud the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee \nfor reporting legislation on this matter, and I thank Senator Joe \nLieberman for cosponsoring this amendment.\n  My amendment requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to issue \ninterim final regulations for chemical facilities that he determines \npresent the greatest security risk. The substance of the regulations \nwould be established by the Secretary.\n  I believe this is a strong first step. Any regulations issued by the \nSecretary under this authority would only be applicable until final \nregulations issued under other laws are established.\n  We have waited too long. The potential devastation--the terrible loss \nof life, the huge hit to the Nation's economy, the irreparable harm to \nour air and water--the potential devastation demands that we take steps \nnow to secure these chemical facilities. There has been enough talk; it \nis time to act. I urge all colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending amendments are set aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd], for himself, Mr. \n     Lieberman, Mr. Rockefeller, and Mrs. Clinton, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4620.\n\n  Mr. BYRD.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To require the Secretary of Homeland Security to conduct \n  tests of unmanned aerial vehicles for border surveillance along the \n              border between Canada and the United States)\n\n       On page 127, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following:\n       Sec. 540. Not later than 1 year after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Homeland Security \n     shall establish and conduct a pilot program at the Northern \n     Border Air Wing bases of the Office of CBP Air and Marine, \n     United States Customs and Border Protection, to test unmanned \n     aerial vehicles for border surveillance along the \n     international marine and land border between Canada and the \n     United States.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment to the \nHomeland Security appropriations bill to address an area that needs \nmore attention, the northern border. We have 5,526 miles of border \nbetween the United States and Canada. That is about double the length \nof our southern border with Mexico. Along that border, about 560 miles \nof it is in the State of Montana. The terrain is remote in many cases. \nIt is mountainous. Passage is somewhat difficult in some areas. In \nothers it is easy; it is wide open.\n  This amendment will help our Border Patrol cover this vast area by \nrequiring the Department of Homeland Security to conduct a pilot \nprogram using unmanned aerial vehicles along that border.\n  In addition to personnel training, we must also employ the latest \ntechnologies. The border patrol has already\n\n[[Page S7389]]\n\nconducted successful tests using UAVs along the southwestern border in \nArizona for aliens and detection of those attempting to enter our \ncountry illegally. It requires some of the UAVs already provided for in \nthis bill be used to run a pilot program on the northern border similar \nto that conducted on the southern border.\n  We do not want to compete with our friends in the Southern States, \nbut we want to make it clear that the northern border also needs \nincreased attention. As you can imagine, as the southern border of the \nUnited States is tightened, our northern border, which used to be \nAmerica's back door, is quickly becoming a front door.\n  Customs and Border Patrol report that their No. 1 concern on the \nsouthern border is illegal immigration. What is the No. 1 concern on \nthe northern border? Terrorism. Border gangs are going international \nand admit having ties to al-Qaida and smuggling al-Qaida members into \nthe United States.\n  In Montana, markings from these gangs have been found in the \ncorrectional systems, within the walls of our jails, in our detention \nfacilities.\n  Surveillance of our ports is happening daily by nefarious people. It \nappears that our procedures for checking out vehicles both leaving and \nentering our country are being looked at by criminals, and it has been \nreported that these ``dry runs'' are being conducted near Glacier \nNational Park. All of these activities are made easy due to the wide \nopen space and insufficient numbers of law enforcement personnel along \nour northern border.\n  The ability of our Border Patrol to successfully carry out their \ndaily duties is of critical importance, obviously, to the safety of all \nAmericans. This amendment will give us the tools we need to protect our \nborders. UAVs are a safe alternative to placing civilians in harm's \nway, and by introducing a pilot program that helps us patrol our \nnorthern border, we are getting on the right track to fighting the war \non terrorism and keeping our home front safe.\n  For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senators Cantwell and \nMurray as cosponsors to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of this \namendment offered by my colleague from a northern border State, and \nwant to emphasize that homeland security along our northern border is \nof the utmost importance.\n  I think the amendment offered by the Senator from Montana is a very \nimportant amendment for us to add to this legislation because of both \nits efficiency and effectiveness in helping us secure our northern \nborder. For us, with great transportation crossings as we have in \nWashington State, including ferry transportation crossings, there was \nthe instance in the Northwest where a terrorist was caught coming \nacross from Canada into Port Angeles who was detained.\n  But we are here today to talk about the vastness of the northern \nborder that sometimes is penetrated by people who are not checking in \nat various checkpoints but try to sneak into the country along the \nvast, rugged areas of our Northwest terrain.\n  So it is very important we get tough on border security by passing \nthis amendment, which has cutting-edge technology that will actually \nhelp save this country dollars and provide greater border security.\n  The unmanned aerial vehicles, as Senator Baucus has talked about, are \nalready being deployed on dangerous patrols in the Middle East and in \nsome places along our borders here at home. But the UAVs, I believe, \nare already in limited use on the southern border, and they have proven \ntheir effectiveness. To me, it is something we ought to expand on for \nour overall capability to help respond to incidents.\n  With their extended range, these UAVs can conduct prolonged \nsurveillance, sweep over remote border areas, relaying information to \nborder agents on the ground. As has been described by some of the \npeople I have met with on this issue, they literally create a \ncommunications network from the air to the ground that can get vital \ninformation to those who are involved in border security who can more \neffectively, then, do their job.\n  This process provides critical intelligence about the areas that have \npreviously gone unsecured for so long, and it allows our agents to \nbetter prepare and respond to incidents involving both illegal \nimmigrants and drug smugglers.\n  Now, I know there has been the Insitu Group from our State that has \nprovided this technology in our Operation Iraqi Freedom and the global \nwar on terror. They have flown many hours and been very effective with \nthat technology. So I believe it is important for us to now get \naggressive about using this same technology--that has been proven so \nsuccessful--on our northern border and to have the continuation of its \nuse on our southern border so we can modernize the patrol capabilities \nand reach hundreds of miles that have previously been unguarded.\n  As I said, we do this at a much more effective rate than could \npossibly be done with any other tools and technology or manned efforts. \nSo we will be giving our agents the best technology possible for them \nto guard our southern and northern borders, using improved \nintelligence. That is why I am so happy to work with Senator Baucus to \ndirect the Department of Homeland Security to do a pilot on this UAV \nsurveillance along the northern border.\n  I will continue to work with him and many of my other colleagues to \nencourage Homeland Security to run this pilot program in affected areas \nthroughout the Northwest and making sure that the investment here is \nrealized so we can continue the expansion of this operation.\n  As I said, the technology will help law enforcement at every level do \ntheir job, and it will help us in fighting this influx of drug problems \nwe are also facing in the Northwest as well. And it will certainly give \nour citizens at home more security.\n  We cannot turn our backs on the needs of the northern border while we \nare looking at some of the issues on the southern border. So let's make \nsure we are effective in covering both areas of our country and giving \nlaw enforcement the broadest tools possible to do their job.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I advise Members and their staff who are \nlistening that we have put out a request for anybody who wishes to \naddress the amendment from Senator Byrd to get in touch with us, and if \nthey have an objection to get in touch with us. Otherwise, at 3 \no'clock, I intend to move to accept that amendment--just so people are \naware of that, unless we hear an objection.\n  The Senators from Montana are working on making sure the language of \nthis pending amendment--I understand Senators Burns and Baucus from \nMontana are working to make sure the amendment is correctly drafted. \nOnce they work out the correct drafting of the amendment, then I would \nexpect we would accept that amendment also.\n  Pending that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4614\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I call up Senator Byrd's amendment No. \n4614.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Gregg], for Mr. Byrd, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 4614.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows\n\n   (Purpose: To establish procedures for grants for State and local \n                               programs)\n\n       On page 93, line 4, before the period insert the following: \n     ``: Provided further, That for\n\n[[Page S7390]]\n\n     grants under subparagraphs (B) through (F), the applications \n     for such grants shall be made available to eligible \n     applicants not later than 75 days after the date of enactment \n     of this Act, eligible applicants shall submit applications \n     not later than 45 days after the date of the grant \n     announcement, and the Office for Domestic Preparedness shall \n     act on such applications not later than 45 days after the \n     date on which such an application is received''.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, \nSenator Byrd, in offering an amendment to the Homeland Security \nappropriations bill for fiscal year 2007 that would require the \nDepartment of Homeland Security to issue interim regulations to help \nsecure the most dangerous chemical facilities around the country.\n  Since 9/11 opened our eyes to the threats we face on U.S. soil from \nIslamist terrorist groups, we have moved to improve security for many \nof the critical elements of our society and economy. But somehow we \nhave not yet protected one of our greatest vulnerabilities--the \nchemical sector.\n  Chemicals are vital to many of the processes that feed us, heal us, \nand power our economy. Yet the very pervasiveness of the chemical \nsector makes it vulnerable to terrorism. Thousands of facilities \nthroughout the country use or store potentially lethal materials, often \nnear large population centers.\n  We know that terrorists are interested in targeting these facilities. \nThe Congressional Research Service reports that during the 1990s both \ninternational and domestic terrorists attempted to use explosives to \nrelease chemicals from manufacturing and storage facilities close to \npopulation centers. The Justice Department in 2002 described the threat \nposed by terrorists to chemical facilities as ``both real and \ncredible,'' for the foreseeable future.\n  When homeland security expert Richard Falkenrath testified before our \ncommittee last year, he said that one asset above all others stands out \nas being acutely vulnerable and uniquely dangerous: toxic-by-inhalation \nchemicals. He said the Federal Government had done virtually nothing to \nsecure the facilities manufacturing and storing these chemicals and \ncalled on the 109th Congress to give the executive branch the authority \nto mandate and enforce security enhancements for these facilities.\n  I think Congress has the responsibility to enact a strong and \ncomprehensive chemical security program, and I believe we have started \ndown the right road to do so. Last month, the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee unanimously approved the Chemical \nFacility Anti-Terrorism Act of 2006, which Senator Collins and I \nintroduced last December. I think this legislation--which was crafted \nand approved on a bipartisan basis after four hearings and extensive \ninput--is the best way to address the vulnerability posed by chemical \nsites. The bill would authorize DHS to issue final regulations to help \nsecure the Nation's most at-risk chemical facilities.\n  I urge the administration--which has said it wants legislative \nauthority to regulate chemical security--to actively support this \nstrong, bipartisan legislation and the majority leader to give it with \nimmediate consideration on the Senate floor.\n  But we cannot afford to take chances where chemical security is \nconcerned and every day of additional delay on chemical site security \nplaces the American people at unacceptable risk. So while it is my \ngreat hope that we will enact the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Act \nof 2006 soon to establish a permanent chemical security program, this \namendment is critical to ending the long drought of inaction on \nchemical security by the Federal Government and ensuring we will move \nswiftly to begin to close this critical homeland security gap.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4614) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the regular order is the Baucus amendment; \nis that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Baucus amendment is now pending.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4620\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Baucus \namendment be set aside and that the Byrd amendment be returned as the \nregular order. It is amendment No. 4620.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, amendment No. 4620 will be \nmade the regular order.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4620) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GREGG. I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. GREGG. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in favor of an \nextremely important provision in the pending bill. That funding \nprovision is the $40 million to support the Counter-MANPAD program. \nThis is a program initiated by Congress to develop technology to \nprotect commercial aircraft from man-portable air defense systems or \nMANPADS, known to many as shoulder-fired missiles or portable anti-\naircraft weapons. Congress originally included $110 million in funding \nfor this program in the fiscal year 2006 budget and there is currently \n$40 million in the pending fiscal year 2007 Homeland Security \nAppropriations bill. This funding will allow for the completion of \nPhase III of this important program. This phase includes testing of the \ntechnology in real-world operations, a final report on the findings to \nCongress and the termination of the program.\n  Unfortunately, the Department of Homeland Security has decided to \ncomplete the program and report its findings based on Phase III flight \ntesting on cargo aircraft only. This is a decision that I question \nbecause it runs counter to the program's original objective of \ndeveloping a system that would protect primarily passenger aircraft, \nbut also protect cargo aircraft.\n  Operations in the cargo and commercial aviation industries are very \ndifferent and I believe that any final reporting or evaluation must \ninclude an assessment of the potential deployment of a Counter-MANPAD \nsystem on passenger aircraft as well as cargo aircraft. Without the \nactual flight testing of the Counter-MANPAD system on passenger \naircraft, it is impossible to accurately evaluate the system.\n  Moreover, future policy decisions on aircraft protection would be \nbased on findings that many could argue are incomplete. Prior funding \nhas already gone a long way towards approving this important \ntechnology, and adding a passenger aircraft study would validate the \noriginal objective set forth by DHS and Congress, and in no way delay \nany final reports from the program office.\n  I commend the work of the subcommittee for including this funding as \nwell as those who participated in the program through the Department of \nHomeland Security, phases 1, 2, and 3. I also commend the many \nparticipants in the private sector: from the scientists, engineers, to \nthose who test the equipment to ensure that it is the strongest, most \ncompetitive, most viable system.\n  I thank the committee for its work and yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. What is the regular order, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's amendment is the pending \nquestion.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 4621, as Modified\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I send a modification to the desk.\n\n[[Page S7391]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has a right to modify the \namendment. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 4621), as modified, is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To require the Secretary of Homeland Security to conduct \n  tests of unmanned aerial vehicles for border surveillance along the \n              border between Canada and the United States)\n\n       On page 127, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following:\n       Sec. 540. Not later than 1 year after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Homeland Security \n     shall establish and conduct a pilot program at the Northern \n     Border Air Wing bases of the Office of CBP Air and Marine, \n     United States Customs and Border Protection, working \n     expeditiously with the Administrator of the Federal Aviation \n     Administration to test unmanned aerial vehicles for border \n     surveillance along the international marine and land border \n     between Canada and the United States.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the modification to the amendment I \noffered is including the phrase, ``working expeditiously with the \nAdministrator of the Federal Aviation Administration.''\n  The purpose is to make sure that the Department of Homeland \nSecurity's efforts in operating the pilot program along the northern \nborder is one that can work with the FAA because the FAA will probably \nhave to give clearance for air traffic taking off. In addition, the FAA \nwill need to, it is my understanding, offer a waiver for these types of \naircraft as they have at the southern border. It is my hope, in working \nwith Senator Burns, that this will clear up potential problems that may \narise. I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  I have already spoken about this and why I think it is important. The \nefforts on the southern border are to combat illegal immigration, and \non the northern border they are more to combat terrorism. There are \nmany more reports of potential terrorist casing and transporting of \npeople into the United States from the northern border. It is becoming \nquite alarming.\n  It is our hope that this will help control the northern border and \nhelp with the additional personnel really needed on the northern \nborder. We don't have that personnel. I think this will help make our \ncountry more secure. I thank my colleague from Montana, Senator Burns, \nfor making this suggestion. This is a good suggestion. It will \nstrengthen this amendment. I hope it will be agreed to.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nMontana. The reason we filed that amendment on Monday was for this \nparticular reason: The FAA controls all air space. Just like we found \nout a little while ago, they only have one area where a waiver has been \ngranted, and this instructs that the Secretary of Homeland Security \nwill work with the FAA, and the FAA will work with the other agency in \norder to allow this pilot program to move forward. It has already been \nestablished in Great Falls. That northern border security that we \nalready have there and this pilot program can move forward with the \nUAV.\n  So I thank my colleague for including that language. That is the \nreason we filed the amendment in the first place. He already put \nlanguage in the immigration bill, but we needed that language that \nstill recognizes the FAA as controller of our air space and is probably \nkey in this pilot program moving forward.\n  I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask uanimous consent that Senators Craig and Coleman \nalso be cosponsors of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection. Is there further debate?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the unmanned aerial vehicle program is \nsomething the subcommittee is supportive of. This concept of having one \non the northern border is something we also support. The Senators have \na good amendment. I think the addition of language on the FAA makes it \nan operable amendment. If FAA were not engaged, it would not be an \noperable amendment. It merges well with the initiative in the bill \nwhich is to stand up the northern airway, which initiative Senators \nBurns, Dorgan, Conrad, and Baucus asked be started. This bill funds two \naircraft out of North Dakota to make sure that we have manned aircraft \non the border.\n  So this is an attempt to tool up the northern border. It is something \nthat is going to take a lot more work. Certainly in the long run there \nis going to have to be more than one unmanned vehicle on the northern \nborder. There will have to be quite a few.\n  As was mentioned by Senator Baucus, the northern border appears to \nhave a high risk of terrorists coming across it. We know numerous \ninstances now of the northern border being used for potential terrorist \ncrossings. Therefore, we cannot ignore that border; we are not ignoring \nthe border. But the issues there are a lot different than the southern \nborder because of the length of the border. In fact, it is heavily \nwooded wilderness and difficult terrain to surveil. So I believe these \nunmanned vehicles will be critical in the long run.\n  I congratulate the Senators for bringing this amendment forward. I \nask unanimous consent that the amendment be accepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment, as modified, \nis agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4621), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, we await further amendments. The Senator \nfrom Illinois wishes to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

I ask \nunanimous consent that the time between now and 5 o'clock be divided as \nfollows: The Senator from New York have 40 minutes and that I have 15 \nminutes in opposition. I think that adds up to the right time--\nactually, now, it doesn't--that I have 20 minutes in opposition. \nWhatever is left after 40 minutes, that is what I have in opposition, \nand at 5 o'clock we proceed to a vote on the amendment of the Senator.\n  There will be 40 minutes for the Senator from New York, 20 minutes \nwill be reserved to myself, and at the conclusion of that time we will \nproceed to a vote, or earlier should the time be yielded back on the \ntime of the Senator from New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators \nObama and Akaka be added as original cosponsors to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, nearly 5 years ago, as we all remember, \non September 11, 2001, terrorists murdered 2,819 Americans, including \n2,752 in New York; 343 firefighters and paramedics and 608 police \nofficers lost their lives. It was the single deadliest attack on \nAmerican soil in our history.\n  We are here debating how much money our country is ready, willing, \nand able to spend to protect our homeland. What is clear, what has been \nclear, is that the threat posed by terrorism requires a great \nmobilization of American might, muscle, resources, and ingenuity. I do \nnot believe that mobilization has yet occurred.\n  Just in last December, the 9/11 Commission, a bipartisan commission, \nreported that we should get failing grades for how we are responding to \nthe challenges of homeland security. Governor Tim Kaine said when it \ncomes to protecting America, it is not a priority for the Government \nright now. The urgency may have faded, but the threat has not. We only \nneed to look at the news and see what happened in Mumbai, India, \nyesterday to be reminded that terrorists strike anywhere, at any time, \nat innocent people.\n  There are many problems with the strategy, or lack thereof, that we \nhave been pursuing on behalf of homeland security. I regret that we \nhave not done more, we have not had a comprehensive strategy, we have \nnot put the money to work in smart, effective ways, and we have \nwitnessed dangerous incompetence with respect to the failed response to \nHurricanes Katrina and Rita. We have gotten a lot of tough talk, but I \nwould take tough action anytime. We got a lot of rhetoric, but I would \ntake resources. We have had campaign slogans, but I would rather have \nreal security.\n  What has been the No. 1 recommendation by every independent group, \nevery expert who has analyzed the threats we face and the challenges we \nconfront when it comes to homeland security? Threat-based funding, that \nwas one of the key recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. Sadly, all \ntoo often funding decisions have been based on politics as usual.\n  I have been championing threat-based funding ever since 9/11. I \nintroduced the Homeland Security block grant bill as well as the \nDomestic Defense Fund Act, both of which provided direct and threat-\nbased homeland security funding to our communities and our first \nresponders. I have personally made the case for threat-based funding to \nSecretary Chertoff and Secretary Ridge before him. Even funds \nsupposedly distributed based on risk have been administered \nincompetently. We just saw an inspector general's report from the \nDepartment of Homeland Security listing all of the alleged threats \naround the country. With all due respect, you can read that list and it \njust causes your head to shake in bewilderment.\n  In May, the Department of Homeland Security announced its 2006 \nHomeland Security grants. Cities and States facing high terrorist \nthreats suffered considerable funding cuts, a decision that can be \nlargely attributed to a series of highly questionable risk assessments. \nNew York City and Washington, DC, remain at the top of any intelligence \nthat we get with respect to threats. Yet they were given drastic \nreductions. Funding under the Urban Area Security Initiative alone was \nslashed in New York City by more than 40 percent, and in Washington, \nDC, by 43 percent. New York State has been struggling since 9/11 to \ncome up with a comprehensive State plan and has been trying to scrape \ntogether funds for what are shortfalls from the Federal Government.\n  Today, I am joining my colleague, Senator Mikulski, and my partner, \nSenator Schumer, in introducing an amendment to the fiscal year 2007 \nHomeland Security appropriations bill to restore the Homeland Security \nGrant Program funding. This amendment provides an additional $790 \nmillion in Homeland Security funds so that next year's levels of \nfunding will match those of 2005. That is all this asks for--bring back \nthe funding to what it was 2 years ago.\n  We have already heard eloquent statements on the floor about port \nsecurity. We have already heard about how difficult it is to get the \nkind of inspections and screenings we need at our ports. That is why I \ncosponsored Senator Byrd's port security amendment, and I am delighted \nthat it actually passed by unanimous consent. I only hope that we will \nfight for that when this goes to conference and that the administration \nwill listen and support this extra funding for port security.\n  We are still fighting for border security. We know that we have not \ndone enough. We have had weeks of debates about immigration that are \nreally about border security. What are we going to do to keep our \nborders secure? Not enough. Under this administration, despite the 9/11 \nattacks, our borders have become less secure.\n  According to a May 2006 report by the nonpartisan Congressional \nResearch Service, the U.S. Border Patrol grew at a faster rate and \napprehended more undocumented immigrants each year under President \nClinton than it has under President Bush. We have the technology and \nthe tools. Americans are certainly telling us they want us to make our \nborders secure. So let's get serious. Let's employ new surveillance \nequipment, like detection centers, unmanned ground and infrared \ncameras. Let's enlist and deploy the manpower we need.\n  We just voted on, unfortunately unsuccessfully, putting more money \ninto securing our mass transit systems: our roads, our rails, our \ntunnels. We know how important that is. I cosponsored Senator Biden's \nrail security amendment which would have provided an additional $1.1 \nbillion to enhance rail security, upgrade tunnels, provide for more \nAmtrak police. But it failed.\n  Today I am joining Senator Schumer to submit an amendment to provide \nan additional $300 million for transit security nationwide. I hope it \nsucceeds. Anybody who rides mass transit should know we are doing \neverything we possibly can to take care of and eliminate the \nvulnerabilities that our mass transit systems have.\n  Beyond our financial investments, we also need new strategies and \ncreative ideas. We have been talking about an interoperable \ncommunications system since 9/11. The 9/11 Commission recognized the \nessential critical nature of such a system. But year after year we \ndon't do it. We bring amendments to the floor, we make speeches, it \ndoesn't happen.\n  In May of this year, I introduced legislation to set up a Federal \ninteroperable communications and safety system to create a national \nemergency communications strategy, to make sure that when police and \nfire departments respond they can talk to each other; when the Federal \nGovernment sends help through the Coast Guard or the military or FEMA, \nthey can talk to each other, and they can talk to State and local \nofficials as well.\n  I have also been fighting for several years to make sure that we have \na nationwide emergency 9-1-1 system so that when you call from a cell \nphone people will know where you are.\n  Can you imagine being caught in a terrorist attack or a natural \ndisaster and calling for help and people can't hear you, can't know \nwhere you are, can't send help to you? It happens all the time.\n  I was at an event this morning where an emergency response director \nmade two horrifying calls that went unanswered in one case and a late \nanswer in another because the cell phone couldn't be tracked.\n\n[[Page S7393]]\n\n  We have a lot to do. We can just stand here and list the problems. It \nis not just all about terrorism. Are we truly ready for a pandemic flu? \nDo we have adequate security at our chemical and nuclear facilities? \nAre we prepared for the potential of a dirty bomb attack in a major \npopulation center?\n  I was encouraged that legislation I authored to create a national \nsystem to track radiological materials that could be used to make a \ndirty bomb was finally passed. I thought: OK. Great. I can check that \noff my worry list, which is a pretty long list being a Senator from New \nYork.\n  Then I find out that the administration announced a national plan, \nwhich was the whole idea behind tracking radiological materials. They \nwanted to have a State-by-State approach. In a nutshell, that is what \nis wrong. It is a national problem. The attacks of 9/11 may have \nhappened in Washington, in New York, and in a field in Pennsylvania, \nbut they were attacks on every single American, on our way of life, on \nour values, on our freedom. I don't think we want State-by-State \nresponses. Do you think terrorists are going to stop at a State border \nor a county border? I don't.\n  We have to restore confidence and competence as we approach this \nproblem of homeland security. We have made some progress but not nearly \nenough. Sadly, I think we have put different priorities ahead of \nsecuring our country. I regret that. I hope we make amends. I hope we \nget back on the right track with a comprehensive plan, with the right \nstrategies, with the appropriations we need, and with the distribution \nof those taxpayer dollars in a smart and effective manner, not politics \nas usual.\n  I see on the Senate floor my colleague and friend, one of the great \nleaders on homeland security, the Senator from Maryland. I yield to her \nwhatever time she needs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. President, once again I rise with great pride to support the \namendment offered by the Senator from New York, Mrs. Clinton, as she \nhas so often in the past stood for the fact that funding to fight \nterrorists and to be ready for any kind of major disaster should be \nbased on risk. In other words, money should go to where there is the \ngreatest risk. The Senator from New York has been a longstanding \nadvocate of this from September 12 to standing here today.\n  I support this amendment, as I, too, have done in the past. I am so \nfrustrated with the Department of Homeland Security. It can't get its \nact together. It can't get the job done. It makes poor decisions on \nallocation, and it is saturated with waste and fraud.\n  The last straw was when I opened the paper and saw that the \nDepartment of Homeland Security was slashing funds for high-threat \nurban areas. The money was leaving the Capital region and New York to \ngo to States such as Nebraska. I respect the people of Nebraska. If \nthey are in danger, I want them protected. I don't know about the \nthreats of Montana and Minnesota, but I sure do know about the threats \nin Maryland. We are part of the Capital region, the home of the \nPresident of the United States, the home of the Congress of the United \nStates, the home of the Cabinet that runs Government, the home of the \nSupreme Court, and the FBI.\n  In the Capital region we have the Pentagon, we have the Central \nIntelligence Agency. In Maryland, we have three intelligence agencies \ngathering technical information--and they say we are not a high threat?\n  On September 11, we lost 60 Marylanders at the Pentagon, mostly \nAfrican American, mostly who worked in the clerical positions. And we \nsaid a grateful nation would never forget. Just like the other \nMarylanders who died at the World Trade Center, we said a grateful \nnation would never forget. And the way that we are never going to \nforget is to make sure it doesn't happen again--to protect against \nattacks and, second, that we were going to do whatever we could to be \nable to be ready and respond to any of these attacks.\n\n  When we saw that smoke here at the Capitol that day, it just wasn't \non television. I was so proud of the fact that it was Maryland first \nresponders who were first on the scene because they work together in \nthe Capital region. Rescue One out of Chevy Chase, MD, dashed across \nthe Potomac to be first on site at the Pentagon. They were worried in \nnorthern Virginia because they didn't know what else would happen.\n  I visited that site. Again, on a bipartisan basis, I and Olympia \nSnowe toured the site together. We saw the rubble of the Pentagon. We \nsaw them working to save lives. We saw how they had worked together in \nthe Capital region. Obviously, Homeland Security, its agencies, and its \ndatabase doesn't get it. They don't get it. They do not get the fact \nthat the 9/11 Commission recognized the threats facing our urban areas \nand said target the resources at the areas of greatest need.\n  The Senate recognized the threat facing the Capital region when they \nworked with Senators Warner, Allen, Sarbanes, and myself to establish \nan Office of the National Capital Region so we could coordinate in the \nmost effective way. It enabled the Capital region and also New York and \nother major areas to receive extra resources. However, the Department \nof Homeland Security that gave us the Katrina aftermath ignored \nCongress and ignored the Commission, and they slashed the resources for \nNew York and the Capital region by 40 percent. They said we had gotten \nmoney. Oh. Right.\n  They said: Our database shows you don't deserve it. Thank God for the \nDepartment of Homeland Security's IG. There they go again over there at \nHomeland Security. They can't get it right. Their own inspector general \nsaid the Department's ability to assess risk is seriously flawed.\n  Guess what. They count an insect zoo and a bourbon festival as \ncritical infrastructure.\n  When you listen to the fact that an insect zoo ranks up there with \nthe Supreme Court, doesn't that bug you?\n  Earlier this year, the Department of Homeland Security failed to list \nthe Statue of Liberty and the Empire State Building.\n  They do not know the difference between a bourbon festival and the \nStatue of Liberty. They don't seem to know the difference.\n  This is the data that the Department of Homeland Security used to \nallocate the funding for Homeland Security grants.\n  There were in the State of Indiana over 8,000 assets listed, and in \nNew York over 5,000. Just come with me down the Baltimore-Washington \ncorridor as you pass these agencies that are helping people. There are \nthe threats. We have high-threat targets because of what they do in \nnational security, such as the National Security Agency.\n  We have threats of the heart, like the National Institutes of Health. \nCan you imagine the blow to research if something happened to NIH? Then \ncome with me over there to Calvert Cliffs where we have a nuclear power \nplant, and then come up along the bay and see the U.S. Naval Academy.\n  How does that rank? That is Maryland. Then, of course, there is New \nYork. We all know that New York showed up on every single list.\n  I commend the Senator from New York for offering this amendment. I \nbelieve that as we have organizational reform for Homeland Security, as \nthe Collins' amendment did, and the Clinton amendment made such a \nstrong point, we should have resource funding reform, and the heart and \nsoul of that is the resource funding should follow risk.\n  The Department of Homeland Security along with FEMA should be \noperating on a risk-based strategy with confident professional people \nwho have to learn the difference between an insect zoo, the Supreme \nCourt, and the White House. If they can't get that straight and they \ndidn't know how to build lessons, and they say: Don't worry \n``Brownie,'' you are doing a good job, there they go again. I am fed up \nwith it.\n  If I could vote one more time to dissolve the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, I would. I can't quite do that. But what I can do is make \nsure that the right resources go to the areas with the greatest risk. \nBaltimore would benefit. The Capital region would benefit. New York \nwould benefit. But it is not about money. It is about saving lives and \nsaving people.\n\n[[Page S7394]]\n\n  I want to enthusiastically support the Clinton amendment and know \nthat we are here to try to do this, to save lives, to save communities, \nand to protect the United States of America. If they do not know how to \nbe the Department of Homeland Security, let us in Congress be the ones \nwho understand it and properly fund it.\n  In conclusion, I thank the Senator from New Hampshire because under \nhis leadership the Commerce-Justice Subcommittee was the first \ncommittee to hold comprehensive hearings on terrorism. He remembers the \nquestions and who was in charge. Obviously, you can see that the \nDepartment of Homeland Security is not.\n  I support the Clinton amendment and am happy to be a cosponsor.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 18 minutes and 38 seconds.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I yield 6 minutes to the Senator from New Jersey, to be \nfollowed by the Senator from New York, Mr. Schumer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized for \n6 minutes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New York for \nyielding time.\n  What the Senator is attempting to do is make sure we react \nappropriately to the threats we face. We talk about making sure our \ncitizens are safe. We want to make sure they are safe from terrorist \nattacks around the world, but it has to be focused on protecting our \nhomeland from yet another terrorist attack. Unfortunately, the amounts \ndedicated to State and local Homeland Security grants in this bill fall \nfar short of that goal.\n  Senator Clinton's amendment is crucial because it restores $790 \nmillion that has been slashed from Homeland Security grant programs \nover the past 2 years. This amendment will help ensure our high-risk \nStates and cities get what they need to protect their citizens and to \ndefend our country.\n  How can we justify cutting Federal Homeland Security funds at this \ntime? The administration has been warning us about terrorist plots \ntargeting the passenger rail tunnels between New York and New Jersey. \nThey have broken up another plot that targeted the Sears Tower in \nChicago, areas that are under considerable risk. How do we justify \ncutting funds?\n  We are going to spend some $500 billion on the war in Iraq and \nAfghanistan before this year is out. We should be making sure we \nprotect ourselves from an attack from abroad. But how about attacks \nwithin our boundaries? Almost 3,000 people lost their lives on \nSeptember 11. Nothing could have been worse than to see the \nconsequences of that, as we did from the State of New Jersey. We could \nsee the smoke from the towers. We could see the disappearing World \nTrade Center facilities.\n  The Clinton amendment restores funding for the State Homeland \nSecurity Grant Program, the Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention \nProgram, and the urban area security initiative to the fiscal year 2005 \nlevels.\n  New York and New Jersey bore the brunt of the attacks on September 11 \nand continue to be the most at risk. Just recently, a Lebanese citizen \nwas taken into custody with two other individuals for plotting to bomb \nthe PATH railway tunnels under the Hudson River that connect New Jersey \nand New York.\n  We have seen terror strikes all over the world. Just yesterday, bombs \nwent off on 7 different trains during rush hour in India, killing 160 \npeople and wounding over 460. We do not yet know who is responsible for \nthat atrocity, but coming on the heels of the London and Madrid transit \nsystem bombings and the two attacks on the World Trade Center, it is \nclear that terrorists strike in places that are vulnerable, where they \ncan maximize the number of innocent civilians who will be killed or \nwounded.\n  The FBI has identified the 2-mile strip between the Port of Newark \nand the Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey as the most \nat risk area in the entire Nation for a terrorist attack. Yet my \nState's Homeland Security funding was cut by $4.6 million when the \nfiscal year 2006 grants were allocated. And New Jersey got off \nrelatively well, with an 8 percent cut, compared to New York, which \nlost 37 percent of its funds, or Texas, which lost 31 percent of its \nfunds.\n  Are we truly protecting our citizens if we keep cutting homeland \nsecurity funding? No, we are not. Have we already won the war on \nterror? Has the mission been accomplished?\n  We are fighting terrorists in Afghanistan and Iraq. We want to make \nsure our troops on the front lines there have everything they need to \ndo the job. But the other front line is the home front line. We have to \nmake sure our States and our cities and particularly those places most \nat risk have everything they need to do the job.\n  What are our priorities in the Senate? Reducing inheritance tax for \nmultimillionaires or providing our communities with Homeland Security \nfunds? This is the choice we face on this amendment.\n  We may disagree on whether it is appropriate to have nonrisk-based \nformulas apply to Homeland Security grants, but we can all agree that \ncutting overall funding year after year is not making anyone safer.\n  I urge my colleagues to support Senator Clinton's amendment. I \nproudly support it. We desperately need this restoration of funding for \nhomeland security. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to speak on behalf of this \namendment to strengthen our homeland security efforts--specifically the \nability of first responders to prevent, prepare for, respond to, and \nrecover from terrorist attacks or catastrophic natural disasters. I \ncommend my colleagues, Senators Clinton, Schumer and Mikulski, for \nauthoring this critical amendment and am proud to join them as a \ncosponsor.\n  September 11, 2001, changed our lives forever. We face new and \ndangerous threats from our enemies that we must be prepared to deal \nwith. Furthermore, the Federal response to Hurricane Katrina proved \nbeyond a shadow of a doubt that we are still a nation unprepared for \ncatastrophe. We know our first responders lack the training, equipment, \nand frequently the manpower they need to do their jobs. Most don't even \nhave the basic capability to communicate with one another across \njurisdictional and service lines, and Hurricane Katrina demonstrated \nthat sometimes during a major catastrophe they can't communicate at \nall.\n  Yet the Bush administration seems to have turned its back on the \nlessons of September 11, 2001, and of August 29, 2005, the day \nHurricane Katrina made landfall. The President's budget proposal did \nnothing to indicate otherwise. That proposal eliminates a number of \nfirst responder programs and cuts others, leaving those on the \nfrontlines of the war against terror or on the frontlines of a \nhurricane, struggling to make do with less. It was the latest chapter \nin an ongoing assault on these vital programs: this is the third \nstraight year the administration has sought dramatic cuts in first \nresponder funding, down from $3.95 billion in fiscal year 2004 to just \n$1.97 billion in this year's request.\n  The appropriators have done what they could to restore the worst of \nthe proposed administration cuts, but their bill still leaves some \nprograms below current levels. We simply cannot continue to shrink \nthese accounts that form the backbone of our homeland defense. This \namendment calls a halt to this dangerous slide. It would provide $790 \nmillion to restore the key first responder accounts to fiscal year 2005 \nlevels. Specifically, the amendment would: Add $600 million for the \nState Homeland Security Grant Program, SHSGP, the fundamental building \nblock of States' homeland security efforts, to bring it to $1.1 \nbillion; add $50 million for the Law Enforcement Terrorist Prevention \nProgram, LETPP, to restore it to $400 million. This program helps \nempower our first responders to prevent terrorist attacks, not simply \nrespond after the fact. Add $140 million for the urban areas security \ninitiative, UASI, to restore the program to the FY 2005 total of $885 \nmillion. This program targets additional resources to urban centers \nthat bear particular risk of terror attacks.\n  Frankly, we can and should do more. Interoperability--the ability for \nour first responders to talk to each other--is an urgent need and one \nthat will cost\n\n[[Page S7395]]\n\nfar more than even this amendment will provide. In 1993, an expert task \nforce chaired by our former colleague Senator Warren Rudman concluded \nthat the Nation needed to invest nearly $100 billion more in equipping \nand training our first responders. Instead of heeding that call, this \nadministration has instead led us down a path of shrinking resources \nfor first responder programs. This amendment would be an important step \nto reverse the erosion of these critical accounts.\n  Our enemies are ruthless and choose their own battlefields in the \ncommunities where we live and work. Nature, too, can be ruthless and \nwill strike in unpredictable ways year after year. We must have first \nresponders who are trained and equipped not just to prepare for and \nrespond to catastrophes but to work to prevent them, as well.\n  We worked with a real sense of urgency after September 11, 2001, to \nsecure our nation. We must summon that same sense of urgency now to \nclose the security gaps that remain. I wish there was a cheap way to do \nthat. But there isn't. It takes money--more money than the \nadministration's budget offers and more money than this appropriations \nbill currently provides. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment \nso that we can make additional headway toward our goal of being better \nable to prevent, prepare for, respond to, and recover from the \nterrorist attacks and natural disasters that are sure to come.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 12 minutes and 53 seconds.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4587\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent the pending amendment be set \naside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I call up my amendment No. 4587.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York [Mr. Schumer], for himself, Mr. \n     Menendez, Mrs. Clinton, and Mrs. Boxer, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4587.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To increase the amount appropriated for transit security \n                        grants by $300,000,000)\n\n       On page 91, line 6, strike ``$2,393,500,000'' and insert \n     ``$2,693,500,000''.\n       On page 91, line 22, strike ``$1,172,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$1,472,000,000''.\n       On page 92, line 13, strike ``$150,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$450,000,000''.\n       On page 92, line 16, insert ``: Provided, That not less \n     than $50,000,000 shall be made available for grants for \n     transit and intercity passenger rail security research and \n     development: Provided further, That not less than $50,000,000 \n     shall be made available for grants for overtime compensation \n     in high threat areas'' after ``transit security grants: \n     Provided further, That the amount provided under this \n     subparagraph is designated as an emergency requirement \n     pursuant to section 402 of S.

Mr. President, I am proud to join with my colleagues \nfrom New York and New Jersey. We are doing three amendments together. \nOne, Senator Clinton's amendment, increases the threat money. The \nsecond, the amendment of Senator Menendez, which I believe will be \noffered within the hour or shortly thereafter, will change the wording \nin the formula. My amendment increases money for transit homeland \nSecurity by $300 million. All of these amendments are important to our \nNew York-New Jersey area.\n  We have seen, in the last few months, two things. First, the New \nYork-New Jersey area, of course, continues to be, unfortunately, a \ntarget of choice. When terrorists talk about creating devastation to \nour homeland, unfortunately, New York comes first to their minds. It \nmeans that our city has to be extra vigilant. Our State has to be extra \nvigilant. Our friends across the river have to be extra vigilant.\n  Frankly, while there are threats everywhere, New York has to be more \nvigilant than anywhere else. Yet in a deep disappointment that still \nwounds us, the Homeland Security Department dramatically cut back on \nour funding.\n  The amendment Senator Clinton is offering with which I am proud to be \nher partner, along with Senator Menendez and Senator Mikulski, \nbasically increases the overall pot because we have two problems. The \npie is not large enough, and the way the pie is distributed, \nmaldistributes the money. Senator Menendez' amendment deals with how \nthe money is distributed.\n  It is an outrage that the Secretary of Homeland Security, who \npromised Congress before he was nominated that he would be fair to New \nYork, has cut back so dramatically. He has used the most foolish of \nformulas. He had a peer review process. I have great respect for the \nsheriff of a small town in the Rocky Mountain States, but in all due \nrespect to that sheriff, he should not be the judge of how New York \nneeds money.\n  Today we saw the list of terrorist sites. It reaches the point of \nabsurdity. The Old McDonald Petting Zoo is a target for terrorists. I \nhave been to petting zoos when I was a kid. I took my children to \npetting zoos, but I never saw a terrorist hiding behind one of the \nsheep in Little Bo' Peep's flock. Then they have the Amish Popcorn \nFactory as a terrorist site.\n  Why did this happen? It is because of the careless and sloppy \nattitude at Homeland Security that reflected itself in the formula by \nwhich our city and our State were dramatically cut.\n  The amendments we are talking about would both increase the size of \nthe pie desperately needed when we know the war on terror is real and \nthe threat to our homeland is not subsiding. It is desperately needed \nbecause we are one Nation. Just as the mayor of New York City is not on \nsome peer review panel to determine whether New York City should get \ncorn subsidies, the small town officials, who are very good people in \ndefending their city, are not the folks to determine how much New York \nneeds and where it needs it. We will be having other amendments later \nthat deal with some of the specific issues.\n  My amendment is the third leg of this stool. New York has been \ntargeted repeatedly, whether it is releasing cyanide on a New York City \nsubway car or trying to blow up the PATH that Senator Lautenberg talked \nabout that brings millions of commuters during the course of each year \nacross the river from New Jersey to New York.\n  The terrorists know what we are doing. The Internet allows them to \nknow it. They look for our weakest pressure point.\n  We have done virtually nothing on rail security. Nothing. We spend a \ncouple of pennies for each mass transit rider while we spend $7 or $8 \non each person who flies. And I am glad we spend the $7 or $8 on the \npeople who fly. But mark my words, the terrorists know if air travel is \npretty well protected they will look somewhere else.\n  The most logical place they look, unfortunately, is to the rails, \nwhere millions of people are in unguarded entrances, coming together. \nWe saw it in Madrid. We saw it in London. Unfortunately, once again, we \nsaw it in Mumbai yesterday. We will see it again. I wish that were not \ntrue. God forbid, but it will happen.\n  This is a modest amendment. My colleague, Senator Biden, asked for a \nlarge amount of money. This is just $300 million, but it will go a long \nway. Right now we only spend $150 million. What we would do in our \namendment is double, add $200 million, grants on rail security, the \npersonnel, the dogs. Talk to terrorist experts. They say dogs that can \nsmell explosives or biological or chemical weapons are the best \nanecdote. This would pay for things like that.\n  We also put aside $50 million to develop detection devices. \nTechnology allowed terrorism to occur. Technology can protect us. But \nwe are not availing ourselves of that technology. One of the things I \nhave been pushing for for years is the money to develop a detection \ndevice, much like a smoke detector, that could sit on the ceiling of a \nsubway car or in the entrance of a railroad station. When someone came \nby with a great deal of explosives or biological or chemical or nuclear \nmaterial on their bodies, it would go ``beep,\n\n[[Page S7396]]\n\nbeep, beep,'' and the police would be able to make an arrest before \ndamage was done.\n  This amendment sets aside a modest $50 million to begin that \nresearch.\n  Finally, the amendment provides $50 million for overtime \nreimbursement. Every time we hear of a threat in a different part of \nthe world, the New York City police department must put men and women \non overtime to guard the subways and the dog squads and everyone else. \nThis is a Federal responsibility.\n  The bottom line is, the soft underbelly of subways, buses, and \ntunnels are highly vulnerable to the kinds of terrorist attacks we have \nseen in London and Madrid and Mumbai. Unless we take real steps to beef \nup mass transit security immediately, the bottom line is, we spend more \nthan $7 per airline passenger on air security but little more than a \npenny per mass transit rider.\n  In the wake of these most recent threats and yesterday's tragic \nattacks in India, we need to be doing a lot more to even the score. \nThis week, we have increased funding for border security and port \nsecurity. I ask my colleagues to do the same for rail systems. I will \nask for the yeas and nays on this amendment at an appropriate time.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time to my friend and colleague from \nNew York.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \namendment offered by my friend and colleague from New York. Sadly, \ntoday is an all too appropriate day to be offering an amendment to \nincrease transit funding. Yesterday, the savage bombing of eight \ncommuter trains in Mumbai--densely packed during the evening rush hour \nby people just trying to make their way home--showed once again that \nterrorists find public transportation to be an extremely attractive \ntarget. Currently, the Indian government reports that over 200 people \ndied in the blasts, and the death toll is rising. And so our thoughts \nand prayers are with the people of Mumbai, and our minds should be \nriveted back here in the United States.\n  Two years ago, we saw tragic bombings in Madrid; last year, in \nLondon; yesterday, Mumbai. Each of these should have served as a wake-\nup call to this country, a call to action for Congress to act to secure \nthe over 14 million Americans who use public transportation to get to \nwork each day. The recently disclosed plot against the tunnels under \nthe Hudson River highlights the need for action. One of the targets was \nthe PATH subway tunnel that carries over two hundred thousand people a \nday back and forth between New York and New Jersey. And yet, we \ncontinue to spend a virtual pittance on transit security. The Federal \nGovernment spends about $9 on security for each airline passenger, but \nonly about 1 cent for each bus or train rider. While we need to secure \nour airways, we also need to secure our streets, our rails, and our \nsubways.\n  According to the American Public Transportation Association, our \nNation's transit systems need over $5 billion in capital equipment and \n$800 million per year in annual operating expenses in order to \nadequately meet security needs. One hundred and fifty million dollars a \nyear is not going to get us there. The Schumer/Menendez amendment \nprovides $300 million--not the entire amount we need but a crucial \nincrease over what we are currently providing. In addition to adding \n$200 million for additional transit security grants, the amendment also \nprovides money for research into new security technologies for transit \nand intercity rail. We all know that airport-style screening of \neveryone boarding a train isn't going to work. But that doesn't mean we \ncan simply give up. New technologies offer the promise of being able to \ndetect explosives and chemical weapons far quicker and less obtrusively \nthan we do now, but we need to put the money into researching those \ntechnologies. This amendment will do that. This amendment also provides \nmoney to help local law enforcement authorities out with overtime when \ntheir region is declared to be a high threat area, which is sorely \nneeded in high-risk areas such as the New York and New Jersey \nmetropolitan region.\n  I never want to be standing here and discussing an attack that \nhappened a day earlier on an American subway system, on American \ntrains, or on American buses. It is bad enough that I have to stand \nhere today and discuss yesterday's tragic events in India. But this is \none more wake-up call to a Congress that has continued to hit the \nsnooze button when it comes to transit security. I want my colleagues \nto ask themselves what they would be willing to do, what commitment \nthey would be willing to make, if yesterday's news had been about \ntrains in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Atlanta, Denver, Houston, \nBuffalo, or any other American city. Well, we don't need to wait for an \nattack on American soil. We can make that commitment now, we can \nprovide the resources now so we don't look back some day and ask \nourselves, ``Why didn't we do then what we need to do today?'' And we \nshould ask ourselves now, ``How much more would we be willing to spend \nafter the fact?'' It is far more expensive to respond to an attack than \nto try to prevent one. The Schumer/Menendez amendment is not the final \nstep, but it is a necessary step, and I urge my colleagues to support \nit.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4576\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three minutes 12 seconds.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nBoxer be added as a cosponsor of my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I think this debate must be very \nconfusing to people around our country who might be tuning in or \nsitting in the galleries because we should be spending an appropriate \namount of money, not wasting it. We should have it focused. We should \nnot be thinking of funding places and institutions like those referred \nto by both Senators Schumer and Mikulski. And I think it is bewildering \nfor us even on the floor.\n  It has been so difficult to get a straight story out of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, to get any kind of clear sense of what \nthe strategy is. What is it we have to do to make a case based on \nthreats and risks? And why is money being cut from the places that are \nat the top of the terrorists' hit list?\n  I do not have an explanation. The closest I can come is that we have \nother priorities in this Congress and on the other end of Pennsylvania \nAvenue. We would rather spend money on tax cuts for the wealthiest \namong us. I just do not get it.\n  But we have a chance to send a very clear message with this \namendment, to say: Look, there is not anything more important. Let's do \nit right. Let's require the highest level of competence from this \nadministration and particularly the Department of Homeland Security. \nLet's not spend money wastefully, but let's spend money where we know \nit will give us the best results to protect our country.\n  I make a special plea on behalf of New York. We have spent billions \nof dollars in New York City and New York State. It is not like we have \nbeen waiting around. We have created a 1,000-person intelligence unit \nwith the NYPD, with detectives all over the country. We have spent a \nlot of money beefing up the personnel and putting in equipment. But we \nneed help. We cannot take a 40-percent cut and protect everything that \nneeds to be protected in New York City--from the mass transit system, \nto the Statute of liberty, to the United Nations, to the ports, to \nbridges, to the tunnels; you name it.\n  So I hope we will have a bipartisan vote in favor of going back to \nthe amount of money we spent in 2005, and making sure we spend it in \naccordance with threat and risk.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on amendment No. 4576, and \nyield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator yields back her time.\n  Is there a sufficient second for the yeas and nays?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  Mr. GREGG. This is on the Clinton amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On the Clinton amendment.\n\n[[Page S7397]]\n\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire controls 20 \nminutes.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, let me begin by saying that when I read the \narticle that was in the paper about the decision to basically transfer \na significant amount of dollars from New York and Washington, I was \nsurprised and quite shocked. I said to myself: That doesn't make a \nwhole lot of sense. Because I think most of us understand that New \nYork, Washington, Los Angeles, Chicago, and a couple of other spots \nwhich are probably better not to mention, are truly the No. 1 targets. \nCertainly, New York is at the top of every list, as is the city of \nWashington. So I thought: Why are we doing that? Or why was the \nDepartment doing that? They did not advise us, obviously.\n  I looked into it, and they have a peer-review process for the \napplication of these funds. All these funds go out under a threat-based \nconcept. This has been the insistence of this committee. There are \nfunds that do go out under the formula. I do not happen to be a big fan \nof the formula. It is not a lot of funds compared to the entire block \nof funds. But the vast majority of the funds flow out on the basis of \nthreat-based decisions.\n  Now, what happened was, of the 46 cities that were in competition for \nthese funds, New York came in 44th and the District of Columbia came in \n42nd in evaluation of their proposals. And their proposals, in fact, \nwere just plain poorly written; not only poorly written, they were \npoorly structured, and they did not have behind them the backup that \nwas necessary to make them viable proposals.\n  In that context, the decision was made to take these funds and move \nthem over to other applicants who had put in better proposals. I guess \nif I had been managing the Department, what I would have said is: \nListen, we know that Washington and New York are the primary targets. \nWe also know these proposals, as they came forward, were just not very \ngood proposals and really did not accomplish the goals we are seeking \nin the issue of addressing threat and effectiveness. And effectiveness \nshould be part of this. We should not take effectiveness out because \nthere is no point sending money out if we are not going to get results \nfor it.\n  Probably, if I had been in charge, had the magic wand, I would have \nsaid, escrow this money until we can work with these two cities, and \nregions in the case of New York and Washington, and get the plans in \norder. But that is not the decision that was made. The decision was \nmade to move the dollars to other locales. So there are equities, in my \nopinion, in the arguments made by the Senators from New York and the \nSenators from Maryland and New Jersey. And the equities are strong \nenough that we actually put language in our report that requests that \nthe Department place a higher priority on risk and that they focus on \ndealing with this type of a situation. And I am certainly expecting it \nwill not happen again the way it happened this year.\n  But that is not the essence of this amendment. The essence of this \namendment offered by the Senator from New York is to increase funding \nabove our allocation--I guess it claims it as an emergency--and to \nbasically put additional dollars on the table for the purposes of these \ntypes of threat-based grants.\n  Now, I think it is important to understand that since we started this \nprogram we have put $14.6 billion into the pipeline to try to assist \nthe cities and areas of highest risk, and that in this bill we have \n$2.4 billion to accomplish that. That is a lot of money. And of that \nmoney, only $6.1 billion has actually been taken down. In other words, \nthere is still literally close to $9 billion when you consider this \nyear of money available to address these issues. And to put another big \nchunk of money on top of that, really, I do not think is going to \nimprove the situation from the standpoint of what New York and \nWashington are concerned about, because I think there is enough money \nin the pipeline to accomplish much of what they desire.\n  The right way to correct this problem relative to New York and \nWashington is to have the Department understand these are the priority \nsites, and that if the proposals coming in from these two regions are \nnot of a quality that give the Department confidence that the money is \ngoing to go out and be used effectively, then they should sit down with \nthese two regions and work out the process so we do it right--escrow \nthe money, sit down, work out the problem, figure out how the money can \nbe used so everybody knows it is being use effectively. So that would \nbe the way I would resolve this issue.\n\n  To simply put more money in the pipeline, when we have this much \nmoney in the pipeline, I do not think is going to resolve it. For all \nwe know, they might still not get the money if they went through this \nsame approval process they had this year. Hopefully, they won't. I did \nnote comments by the mayor of New York--and I respect him for this--\nwhere he said he recognized the proposal they sent down here was not up \nto snuff. That is my characterization, but that is the way I read it. \nAnd he is right. It was not. But that did not mean they should not have \ngotten the money. It should have meant the Department should have sat \ndown with them and figured out how to get it right. However, that is, \nas they say, history.\n  As we have moved forward, I believe we have put in adequate language \nto make it clear. And certainly this floor discussion, I hope, \nilluminates the issue further, that we expect these two regions to \nreceive the resources which are in the pipeline, and to receive them in \na robust way, but under the condition that the various programs which \nthey send down here have been worked through so both sides have \nconfidence the money is going to be used effectively.\n  I will, however, have to make a point of order against this amendment \nfrom the Senator from New York because I do not believe the best \napproach at this time is to simply bust the budget, put more money in \nthe pipeline, declaring an emergency, in order to address what was \nreally a programmatic issue and a failure of communication, to be quite \nhonest--a massive failure--between the city of New York and the city of \nWashington and the Department of Homeland Security as to how they \nshould have handled the funds which were in the pipeline.\n  So when the proper time comes, I will make a point of order that this \namendment busts the budget and is not an appropriate use of the \nemergency designation.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4587\n\n  As to Senator Schumer's amendment, which is a follow-on to Senator \nBiden's amendment, I would just renew the comments I made under Senator \nBiden's amendment. We have again increased the funding for rail. It is \nnot anywhere near where I would like to be able to put it, but it is an \nincrease. But, more importantly, there is a large amount of money again \nin the pipeline coming through the funding for Amtrak--$770 million, \nwhich is available for capital improvement.\n  On top of that, it is very interesting, if this is such a high \npriority, why has the discretionary money which we are sending to these \nmajor metropolitan communities been used in such a minor way to address \nrail security?\n  The average, I believe I said earlier, was like 2 percent, and in New \nYork's case they are using 8 percent of their discretionary money for \nrail security. They get a huge amount of money. In fact, New York--and \nI think this should be mentioned for part of the Record--gets \ndramatically more money; even when they lost the funds in this \ncompetitive grant process, they still get, I think, about twice what \nany other community gets, twice what any other community in the country \ngets. And they deserve it, quite honestly. They are where the basic \nthreat is. So I do not begrudge them that.\n  But the fact is, they get a large amount of resources, and they could \ntake much more than 8 percent of\n\n[[Page S7398]]\n\nthose resources and put them toward rail, if they wanted to. But they \ndo not. And to simply put more money on top of this, and, thus, once \nagain go well beyond our allocation, is a mistake and not the fiscally \nprudent thing to do, nor is it the best way to approach the threat in \nthe context of the dollars which are coming from other areas and can be \nused to address the threat--such as the underlying Amtrak funding, such \nas the grants program, which is billions of dollars, and the basic \nfunding in this bill for rail security.\n  So I will also make a point of order against that amendment.\n  I have suggested--and I suggested it to Senator Biden and to Senator \nSchumer--if rail really feels it needs a significant increase in \nresources, they could do it the same way the airlines have done it, by \nassessing a fee on passengers. That is how we pay for the airlines. \nThat is how we are paying, basically, for TSA. A $5 fee would generate, \nessentially, the number that Senator Biden wanted. About a third of \nthat would generate the number that Senator Schumer feels is necessary. \nAnd that is one way they could redress their issue and still stay \nwithin the budget, if they felt it was that important a question.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4576\n\n  So at this point, Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my \ntime, unless the Senator from New York--she used up all her time. I \ndidn't know if the Senator wanted to respond to anything I said.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York has yielded back her \ntime.\n  Mr. GREGG. Does the Senator want any of my time to respond or is the \nSenator all set?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Two minutes if I could.\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield the Senator 2 minutes of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized for 2 \nminutes.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. It is my understanding that a point of order has been \nmade against my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order has not yet been made \nagainst the amendment. The Senator from New Hampshire suggested he \nwould make a point of order but has not made such a point of order. The \nChair has not heard a point of order formally put to the Chair against \nthe amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. I inform the Chair that pursuant to the deeming language \nof Public Law 109-234, I raise a point of order against the emergency \ndesignation of the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the Senator, a point of \norder is made appropriately at the end of the debate. The Senator from \nNew York was asking a question whether a point of order had yet been \nmade.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I hear a point of order that I will then \nrespond to.\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield back the balance of my time, unless the Senator \nfrom New York wants 2 minutes. I renew the point of order.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, pursuant to section 402 of House \nConcurrent Resolution 95, the concurrent resolution on the budget for \nfiscal year 2006, I move to waive section 402 of that concurrent \nresolution for purposes of the pending amendment and ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 47, nays 53, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 195 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--47\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Clinton\n     Collins\n     Dayton\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Menendez\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Obama\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Talent\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--53\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Burr\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Conrad\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Thomas\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The emergency designation is removed.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I raise a point of order against the \npending amendment because it would cause the bill to violate section \n302(f) of the Budget Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order is sustained. The amendment \nfalls.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4587\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, we now move to the Schumer amendment. At \nthe conclusion of the debate, I reserve the right to make a point of \norder against the Schumer amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that there be 2 minutes equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New York is recognized for 1 minute.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, this amendment is simple. It adds $300 \nmillion to probably the most woefully neglected area of homeland \nsecurity, and that is security on the rails, whether it be mass \ntransit, whether it be long-term passenger rail, or freight.\n  We have seen in the last year that transit rails are a target of \nchoice for terrorists. We saw it in London, we saw it in Madrid, and we \nsaw it just yesterday, unfortunately, once again in Mumbai. Our rails \nare very vulnerable. We spend over $7 per air traveler for homeland \nsecurity; we spend about a penny for mass transit. And the terrorists \nalways look for our vulnerability. Transit is vulnerable. Passenger \nrail is vulnerable. Freight rail is vulnerable. There are miles and \nmiles of unguarded track and thousands of people entering unguarded \nentrances. If there were ever a place we needed help, this is it.\n  There are, obviously, things we are doing on port security. The \namendment of the Senator from West Virginia increased that funding. It \nmakes no sense, given that the rails have been the target of the last \nthree major terrorist attacks around the world, to have a paltry $150 \nmillion for rail security.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator from New York yield? I believe we had a \n1-minute agreement.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thought it was 2. How much time do I have remaining, \nMr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 34 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Thirty-four seconds. In the interest of moving things \nalong, I yield back the remainder of my time and urge an ``aye'' vote \non this important amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, also in the interest of moving things \nalong, the debate in opposition to this amendment has been made \nrelative to the Biden amendment. It is basically a ``little Biden,'' \nand it is in excess of the ability of this committee to fund it at the \nlevels being suggested.\n  Pursuant to the deeming language in Public Law 109-234, I raise a \npoint of order against the emergency designation in the pending \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, pursuant to section 402 of H. Con. Res. \n95, the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2006, I \nmove to waive section 402 of that concurrent resolution for purposes of \nthe pending amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the game plan now is to recognize the \nSenator from New Jersey to speak on his amendment. Then we will go to \nthe Senator from Alabama to speak on amendments which he is going to \noffer. There will not be any more votes tonight. Those will be the only \namendments offered this evening. I will formally ask unanimous consent \nto that point. Then tomorrow morning we hope to structure it so we \nbegin voting around 10 or 10:30, initially on the amendment of the \nSenator from New Jersey and potentially, or hopefully, on the amendment \nof the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from Pennsylvania, which \nthey will have a chance to debate in the morning prior to the \namendments. Then, around 12 o'clock, we know we are going to have an \namendment offered by the Senator from Ohio and we will go to that \namendment. In the interim, there will also be an issue of the \namendments of the Senator from Alabama and other amendments which \npeople may wish to bring forward.\n  At this time I ask unanimous consent the Senator from New Jersey be \nrecognized, followed by the Senator from Alabama, to offer their \namendments, and that those be the only amendments offered this evening, \nand at the conclusion of the debate on their amendments we go to a \nperiod of morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 4634, As Modified\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 4634, as \nmodified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Menendez) proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4634, as modified.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide that appropriations under this Act may not be used \n  for the purpose of providing certain grants, unless all such grants \n                meet certain conditions for allocation)\n\n       On page 127, between lines 2 and 3 insert the following:\n       Sec. __. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, \n     appropriations under this Act may not be used for the purpose \n     of providing--\n       (1) formula-based grants or law enforcement terrorism \n     prevention grants, unless all such grants are allocated based \n     on an assessment of threat, vulnerability, and consequence, \n     to the maximum extent praticable, with no State receiving \n     less than 0.25 percent of the funds available for each such \n     grant program, and American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the \n     Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, and the Virgin Islands, each \n     receiving 0.08 of the funds available for each such grant \n     program;\n       (2) discretionary grants for use in high-threat, high-\n     density urban areas, unless all such grants are allocated \n     based on an assessment of threat, vulnerability, and \n     consequence, to the maximum extent practicable.\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, on July 7, just last Friday, media \noutlets across the Nation reported the news that the FBI had apparently \nfoiled a plot to bomb the transit systems that connect New York and New \nJersey.\n  The revelation of this latest plot paints a clear picture of where \nthe terrorists intend to target their actions. Clearly, they want to \nstrike where they can create the greatest loss of life and economic \ndamage. Time and time again, we see that areas like New York, New \nJersey, Washington State, California, Chicago, and others are high on \nthe target lists of terrorists.\n  These most recent threats against New York and New Jersey are only \none example of this in one key area.\n  Why had the terrorists chosen to attack the tunnels and rail system \nthat connect the city of New York with the citizens of New Jersey?\n  Because they wanted to inflict great damage, not only to the tunnels \nand the trains and the people on them, not only to the city of New York \nand the citizens of New Jersey, not only to the metropolitan area that \nencompasses New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut--no, the terrorists \nchose to plan their attack on the New York-New Jersey transit system \nbecause they wanted to inflict great damage on the entire country.\n  More than 100,000 people use the Holland Tunnel everyday. More than \n200,000 people ride the PATH trains every day.\n  Mr. President, 18.7 million people live in the New York/New Jersey \nmetropolitan area, nearly 6.5 million of whom come from New Jersey. New \nYork is home to the financial heart of our country, with key financial \ninstitutions housed right across the river in New Jersey. Imagine what \nwould happen to the Nation, not just New York or New Jersey, if these \nfinancial institutions were shut down.\n  The port in New Jersey, the largest container seaport on the east \ncoast, the third largest in the Nation, handled more than $132 billion \nin goods in 2005 and creates over 200,000 jobs. Imagine what would \nhappen to the Nation, not just New York or New Jersey, if commerce were \nshut down in this port.\n  The greatest ``zone of vulnerability'' in the U.S. is in South \nKearney, NJ, where 12 million people live in proximity to a chlorine \nchemical plant. An explosion at the facility would endanger the life \nand health of people caught in the path of the prevailing winds to that \ngreat extent.\n\n[[Page S7400]]\n\n  The FBI has placed more than a dozen New Jersey sites on the \n``National Critical Infrastructure List'' and has called the area \nbetween Port Elizabeth and Newark International Airport the ``most \ndangerous two miles in the United States when it comes to terrorism.'' \nAn article in the New York Times pointed out that this 2-mile area \nprovides ``a convenient way to cripple the economy by disrupting major \nportions of the country's rail lines, oil storage tanks and refineries, \npipelines, air traffic, communications networks and highway system.'' \nImagine what would happen to the Nation, not just New York and New \nJersey, if the most dangerous 2 miles in America was attacked.\n  Clearly, as we saw last Friday, the terrorists can imagine exactly \nwhat would happen if they attacked New York and New Jersey.\n  If the terrorists understand that New York and New Jersey are \ntargets, why can't the Department of Homeland Security?\n  The recent inspector general report on Homeland Security's National \nDatabase shows that we have it wrong. Certainly the Department of \nHomeland Security has it wrong, once again.\n  According to a recent article by the New York Times, the report \n``reads like a tally of terrorist targets that a child might have \nwritten: Old MacDonald's Petting Zoo, the Amish Country Popcorn \nfactory, the Mule Day Parade.''\n  The inspector general found that the list included items ``whose \ncriticality is not readily apparent'' but are still included in the \nFederal antiterrorism database and that ``the presence of large numbers \nof out-of-place assets taints the credibility of the data.''\n  The fact that this database is being used to help determine risk-\nbased funding simply makes no sense.\n  The bottom-line is that States and municipalities across the country \nthat actually are under the greatest risk should receive the greatest \nnumber of homeland security dollars based on that risk. I cannot \nunderstand why the Department of Homeland Security would not use a \ntruly risk-based formula when awarding their grants.\n  That is why I am offering the Menendez-Lautenberg amendment today. \nThe amendment states that no funds in this bill should go to homeland \nsecurity grants unless they are based on an ``assessment of threat, \nvulnerability, and consequence, to the maximum extent practicable.'' \nNot exclusively, but ``to the maximum extent possible.''\n  The amendment also allows, in specific cases, for each State to \nreceive a minimum of .25 percent of the grants. Let me be clear; while \nI would prefer to give all funds based on risk, I believe that this \ncompromise which makes this amendment different than previous \namendments based on risk, will allow more support for this amendment.\n  It also moves in the direction of where the White House has said they \nwant to see us go on the question of homeland security funds. This is \nalso the same minimum percentage included in the House legislation \nrecently endorsed by the former Chairman and former Vice Chairman of \nthe 9/11 Commission.\n  I certainly hope with this minimum percentage guarantee that our \nSenate delegation will be able to support this amendment.\n  Since we only have a finite amount of money, this is not a place \nwhere revenue sharing should be the policy. Just as Senators from \nagricultural areas of the country call on those of us who may not have \nmuch agriculture for our support, just as the Senators from ravaged \nflood areas call on us for our support, just as Senators from areas hit \nby hurricanes call on us for our support, those of us who come from \nhigh-target areas across the country call on the rest of the Senate for \nequal treatment when it comes to risk-based funding.\n  Many of us in the Senate have been fighting for risk-based funding \nfor years. I know Senators Lautenberg, Clinton, Schumer, and others \nhave led the fight in the Senate. I know our senior Senator from New \nJersey has been a leader over and over again. We are thankful to him \nfor his leadership. I fought for risk-based funding as a former Member \nof the House of Representatives. I included risk-based funding in the \nMenendez substitute to the intelligence reform bill in 2004 which was, \nunfortunately, voted down by my Republican colleagues. I fought for \nrisk-based funding in the conference report on that legislation. I \ncontinued to fight for risk-based funding when I introduced the risk-\nbased Homeland Security Funding Act in the House, which Senator \nLautenberg also introduced in the Senate. Most recently here in the \nSenate, we have introduced legislation to make sure we fully and \nfinally implement the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission, which \nincludes risk-based funding. But today we are here to fight the next \nround of this battle.\n  I am proud to have Senators Lautenberg, Clinton, and Schumer as \ncosponsors of this amendment.\n  It is important when we talk about homeland security. We have seen \nthe votes on a host of these funding issues. You can't have the \nadministration talking tough on homeland security and then acting weak. \nCutting funds to homeland security grants simply makes no sense.\n  For those from New York and New Jersey and from other parts of the \ncountry--Pennsylvania or Washington, DC--for those from those areas \nwhere loved ones were killed on September 11 of 2001, this is not an \nabstract policy discussion. This is not an abstract policy discussion \nfor us. This is personal. Over 700 people from the State of New Jersey \nwere killed. My former congressional district looks directly at the \nsite where the Twin Towers once stood. In New York and New Jersey, we \nstill live with the aftermath of these attacks on a daily basis. Just \ntoday, we learned in a Quinnipiac poll that 77 percent of New Jerseyans \nexpect a terrorist attack in the United States in the next 6 months.\n  The No. 1 role of our Government is to keep us safe. That is what \nAmericans expect. That is what the people of New Jersey have been \nsaying to me all along. They believe--and we can see from the nature of \nthese revelations of the plots--they are going to be attacked, and they \nneed the Government to meet its No. 1 responsibility to them; that is, \nto keep them safe.\n  How can we keep them safe if we allow the funding for homeland \nsecurity grants to be underfunded? How can we keep them safe if we \naren't making sure that the places at greatest risk of attack get the \nmost money to protect against those attacks? And how can we come to a \nconclusion that we don't assign--even with this compromise amendment \nwhich still provides 2.5 to all of the States but still takes the \nmajority of that money to where the greatest risks are, how do we not \nhold the view that this is one country and these attacks, in fact, \nwould affect the entire Nation?\n  The Senate has both an obligation and a moral responsibility to \nprotect the people of the United States. The only way to do that is to \ntake all possible steps to prevent terrorist attacks.\n  One of the critical ways is to follow the 9/11 Commission's report, a \nunanimous and bipartisan conclusion that homeland security funding \nshould be based strictly on risk. We have taken that as a foundation, \namended it somewhat to create, hopefully, a greater groundswell of \nsupport but still with the fundamental principle that ultimately the \nmajority of our homeland security funding should go to where the \ngreatest risks in our country are and the greatest risk that ultimately \nwould affect the Nation in its commerce, in its security, and in its \nability to sustain itself.\n  That is why I urge my colleagues to support the Menendez amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I would be happy to yield to the distinguished \nchairman.\n  Mr. GREGG. I am intrigued by the amendment. We have worked very hard \non the committee to have a threat-based funding formula, so that is my \ngoal. I have no problem with the reduction to 2.5 even though it would \nprejudice my own State. But my view is that the target should be where \nthe funding goes.\n  I just wanted to be sure that when the Senator uses those terms of \nart here, that it is not his intention to undermine the capacity of \npeer review groups to look at the issue. The Senator used the term \n``unless all such grants are allocated based on threat, vulnerability, \nand consequence to the maximum extent practical,'' which seem to be \npretty good words of art.\n\n[[Page S7401]]\n\n  For the record, I would like to make it clear that the Senator is not \ntrying to adjust the peer review process which looks at threat and \neffectiveness of the plan. Is that correct?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. That is correct. We are silent on effectiveness because \nwe think effectiveness is very important as part of that equation.\n  Mr. GREGG. In light of that, I probably will support the amendment, \nalthough I suspect there are others who will oppose the reduction of \n2.5. In any event, I think the amendment is a good amendment.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I thank the distinguished chairman.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, first I commend my colleague, Senator \nMenendez, for his persistence on this issue. We both come from the \nnorthern part of the State of New Jersey, which is the most dense \nportion of the most densely populated State in the country.\n  Seven hundred of our fellow New Jerseyans lost their lives on \nSeptember 11, 2001. It would be hard to find people whose lives were \nnot touched by the events of that day--whether immediate neighbors, \nfriends, family, all of us knew someone who was killed or injured on \nthat fateful day. From our part of New Jersey, you could see the smoke \nrising from the World Trade Center where many of our friends, \nneighbors, and loved ones worked.\n  The New York-New Jersey region bore the brunt of the attack on 9/11, \nand to this day it remains the area of our country that is most at risk \nof another attack. We were reminded of this just last week when \nauthorities disrupted a plot by eight terrorists to blow up commuter \ntrain tunnels connecting New Jersey and New York. Each day, nearly \n200,000 people travel through these tunnels.\n  Since we don't have unlimited resources for homeland security, \nhomeland security must be targeted to those parts of the country most \nat risk of another terrorist attack. But that isn't currently the case. \nWhy? Because this Congress is treating homeland security funding as \njust another pork project rather than sending the resources based \nsolely on risk, as has been recommended by the 9/11 Commission. And in \nsection 25:\n\n       Homeland security assistance should be based strictly on \n     assessments of risks and vulnerabilities.\n       [F]ederal homeland security assistance should not remain a \n     program for general revenue sharing.\n\n  This is by the authors of this Commission report which was adopted \nwholeheartedly in this place.\n  Because each State gets a minimum guarantee of funding regardless of \nrisk or population density, we take resources from States known as \nmajor terrorist targets and give them to low-risk areas.\n  Politics rears its ugly head.\n  I saw the prevailing view on the Homeland Security Committee on which \nI sit--the committee of jurisdiction. I called the attention of the \ncommittee to the report of the 9/11 Commission very specifically and \nasked the committee to endorse fully the risk-based distribution \nmechanisms for funding. Perhaps my argument wasn't persuasive, but the \nvote was 15 to 1 against it, solely basing this distribution of grants \non risk. It was painful for me to see that.\n  I want to give you an example. In fiscal year 2006, New Jersey \nreceived $1.92 per capita spending for State homeland security and law \nenforcement terrorism prevention grants. Wyoming received $14.73. New \nJersey, the most densely populated State in the country, received $1.92 \nin per capita spending; and Wyoming--a beautiful State, though I think \nit is fair to say that their risk of a terrorist attack is \nsubstantially different or not even this in terms of what terrorist \nplanning is typically doing--Wyoming, $14.73. Are the people of Wyoming \nseven times more likely to be the victims of a terrorist attack than \nthe people of New Jersey? I don't think so.\n  The FBI has identified the 2-mile strip between the Port of New York \nand Newark-Liberty International Airport in New Jersey as the most \ninviting target in the entire Nation for a terrorist attack because of \nthe huge amount of damage that could be inflicted. It is believed--this \nisn't secret, it has been published many times in many places--it is \nbelieved that a terrorist attack in this area could kill or injure more \nthan 10 million people because of the density of population there and \nthe presence of so many chemical facilities.\n  The way we fund homeland security flies in the face of the 9/11 \nCommission recommendations. We see it on this placard. It is a stark \nreminder of what we ought to be doing and how much it differs from what \nwe are arguing.\n  Today, nearly 5 years after 9/11, nearly 40 percent of the State \nHomeland Security Grant Program is given out as ``general revenue \nsharing'' to each and every State and territory regardless of the \ndanger they face from terrorism. The system is broken. We have to fix \nit. I have been trying to reform this grant program for several years.\n  In February 2005, I introduced a bill called the Risk-Based Homeland \nSecurity Funding Act, which would require that all homeland security \ngrants be based strictly on risk, threat, and vulnerability. My \ncolleague, Senator Menendez, did similarly when he was a Member of the \nHouse of Representatives. The amendment offered by my colleague today \nmoves us in that direction. That is why I so strongly support it.\n\n  Under the Menendez-Lautenberg amendment, the Senate minimums will be \nreduced from .75 percent of Homeland Security funding to .25 percent. \nThat lower amount, .25 percent, is the same as the allocation President \nBush recommends. Even the Bush administration confirms the .75 minimum \nis inappropriate and puts our security at risk. Secretary Chertoff has \nconsistently advocated Homeland Security funding be risk-based.\n  By reducing these State minimums, we can better protect the Nation by \ngetting more funding to areas that are actually under threat and risk. \nIf Congress will not eliminate State minimums, the best way to proceed \nis to reduce the State minimums so that as much money as possible is \ndirected toward the highest risk areas.\n  If we review past terrorist attacks, it is clear terrorists want to \nattack densely populated areas, areas where they can inflict the most \ndamage. We heard my colleague, Senator Menendez, talk about the damage \nit could do to our national economy if we have a major attack in this \nvery sensitive area. They want to kill as many people as they can, \ndisrupt economic life as it exists.\n  I urge our colleagues to support the Menendez-Lautenberg amendment. A \nvote for this amendment is a vote in support of the administration's \nposition, the 9/11 Commission position, and plain common sense.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I will be offering some amendments to \nthe Homeland Security bill that I think are important. I thank Senator \nGregg for his leadership and his interest and his hard work in meeting \nsome of the demands of this Nation with regard to homeland security. \nUnfortunately, we have not been able to meet all of those demands.\n  America, we have a problem, a very real problem.\n  This Senate and its action concerning immigration with relation to \nthe bill that just passed this Senate is beginning to create a \ncircumstance that in every respect looks like 1986, the year we passed \nthe last immigration bill. We must not allow a repeat of 1986. This \nSenator will do all that he can to see that does not happen.\n  It goes to the very heart of our service in this Senate. It goes to \nthe integrity of the Senate. It goes to the respect with which we want \nto be held by our constituents around this country. We must not repeat \nwhat happened in 1986. We must not allow a repeat of the 1986 \nimmigration bill.\n  Back when the immigration bill started moving through the Judiciary \nCommittee, I raised this very point. It came about in an interesting \nway. I offered an amendment in the committee\n\n[[Page S7402]]\n\nto expand bed space. It was accepted. I offered another amendment, and \nit was accepted. I began to think: It is easy to authorize, isn't it? \nIt is very easy to pass a bill that authorizes more bed space. It is \nvery easy to pass a bill that authorizes a fence to be built along the \nborder to improve our security. It is easy to authorize more Federal \nagents to be hired, more workplace enforcement to be put in place. It \nis easy to authorize the expansion of the US-VISIT Program, which is \ncentral to an entry-and-exit system. It is easy to authorize interior \nenforcement agents around the country.\n  But an authorization is merely an authorization. Those agents do not \nget hired, they will not be paid, the VISIT system will not be in \nplace, the fences will not be built until money is appropriated. This \nis the bill we would expect that appropriation to take place.\n  That is the problem we have. The bill does provide some additional \nexpenditures for Homeland Security and for border enforcement and for \nother things. For that we are grateful. But the big matters that go to \nthe heart of whether we are going to have a lawful system have not been \nfunded adequately. It is something we have to confront and deal with in \nan effective way.\n  In 1986, we promised we would just have amnesty one time. It was the \namnesty to end all amnesties, unlike today, when we deny we are \noffering amnesty. In fact, the proposal we passed in the Senate does \njust that. It is very similar to 1986.\n  What was the promise? The promise is we will have enforcement in the \nfuture and we will not need another amnesty. They said in 1986 it was \nan amnesty to end all amnesties. That was the argument. That is what we \ntried to do. That is what they tried to do at the time.\n  What happened? The promises that were made about enhanced enforcement \ndid not occur. I point out, 2 million people were expected to claim \namnesty; 1.5 million people were expected to claim amnesty. When it \nconcluded, 3 million people had claims. Almost double the number of \npeople came forward to claim the amnesty, many of them with fraudulent \ndocuments and inadequate proof. But they got it because it could not be \ndisproved, and the numbers were so large.\n\n  That system did not work well, but the amnesty was part of the \nimmigration bill. It became law. Everyone entitled to that amnesty got \nit. It openly was called amnesty. I note for the record that Black's \nLaw Dictionary, in its definition of the word ``amnesty,'' lists the \n1986 immigration bill as one of its definitions.\n  These people got their legal status, their citizenship track, the \nbenefits of welfare, earned-income tax credit, and all the other \nbenefits that accrue for people in the United States, but the \nenforcement never came.\n  Remember, we said it was not going to happen again not too long ago, \njust 20 years ago. Where are we today? We now have an estimated 11 \nmillion people in our country illegally. We say we have to do something \nabout this, but we cannot call it amnesty. But we will create this \nlittle system where they pay $1,000 or $2,000 and they are on a track \nto full citizenship--but it is not amnesty. Mind you, there is hardly \nany difference between what we did in 1986, but this year it is not \npopular to talk about amnesty because people have been around the \ncountry listening to their constituents, and the people of America are \nnot happy with amnesty. They do not like it.\n  Many Members of this Senate have promised not to vote for amnesty. So \nall they do when they vote for this bill is redefine the meaning of \nwords and say it is not amnesty. They just say it is not amnesty. They \nvote for it and say: I didn't vote for amnesty.\n  They have to wait a while before they get citizenship. They have to \npay $1,000. And if they held back taxes for 5 years, if they pay taxes \nfor 3 of those years--and they pick the 3--then they have paid the \nprice. They have paid the penalty. They earned their amnesty by paying \nback taxes. Yet American citizens pay their taxes all 5 years. How are \nyou going to prove the back taxes anyway?\n  This is nothing more than amnesty. I drive this point home. What is \nthe point? The point is, that has been put into law by the bill we \npassed in this Senate. Now they say: We will have enforcement this \ntime; we are going to do the things that are necessary to have \nenforcement.\n  A lot of people say we really do not like a fence, but after they \ntalk to their constituents back home--and I offered the amendment to \nhave 350 miles of fences and 500 miles of barriers, and we had a vote. \nIt passed 83 to 13--we passed an amendment to build the 350 miles of \nfences, 500 miles of barriers. We have authorized it, colleagues. That \nis all we did was authorize it.\n  I have heard the comments: I voted for the Sessions amendment. I \nvoted to build a fence. I am for enforcing immigration laws. When do we \nbuild this fence? Where do we get the money to build this fence? What \nbill is it that the money has to come out of? It is a Homeland Security \nbill. That is the one in the Senate. We have been looking through the \nbill, reading the fine print, and it is not in there. The money to \nbuild the fence is not included.\n  We should be ashamed. We trumpeted this. The majority leader said he \nwas supportive of this. Everyone was supportive of building a fence. \nWhen it comes time to pay up and actually buy the bricks or buy the \nwire and pay the people to do it, where are we?\n  I raised this in the Judiciary Committee. I offered an amendment sort \nof like the Isakson amendment at that time. Senator Isakson offered his \namendment in the Senate that said: We see this problem coming, \ncolleagues. This has been the pattern. We authorize things, we make \npromises, but we do not follow through, so let's do the Isakson \namendment which says none of this amnesty takes place until the \nenforcement takes place at the border and we follow through on the \nthings we promised to do.\n  That is a pretty clever little amendment. Why would anybody object to \nthat? Why would anybody who voted and promised to build fences, to add \ndetention beds, to add agents--why in the world would you vote for \nthose kinds of things and then not want to follow through on them?\n  I think it was troubling to me--troubling to a lot of Americans; I \nknow troubling to Senator Coburn, the Presiding Officer--when Senator \nIsakson's amendment did not pass. Why? Why did Senator Isakson's \namendment not pass? Well, the American people are pretty cynical now \nabout our commitment and our integrity when it comes to matters \ninvolving immigration. And I suggested at the time and worried at the \ntime that the reason the Isakson amendment did not pass was there was \nnever any intention to fund the fence, to fund increased bed space, and \nfund the increased agents, make the US-VISIT program work--never any \nintention.\n  Now, wouldn't that be a bad thing? Wouldn't that reflect badly on the \nintegrity of the U.S. Senate, when the whole Nation is looking at us? \nThey are frustrated with us. They have not forgotten 1986. People \nremember that. They remember that. And they are looking at us: Are we \ngoing to do this again? And the first bill that comes up, we don't have \nmoney in it to fund the fence that we voted 83 to 16 to build. That is \njust breathtaking when you think about it.\n  It was a highly debated issue. It was probably one of the more \nnoteworthy amendments in the entire debate. People thought it might be \na close vote. As it turned out, it was an overwhelming vote. But it is \neasy to vote to authorize, isn't it, if you never intend to fund. That \nis an easy vote. I see the young people and the pages and those around \nhere. Learn something about the U.S. Senate. It erodes public \nconfidence in the integrity of the Government when you brag and speak \nglowingly about taking aggressive action to improve enforcement of \nimmigration laws in America and then do not do it.\n  That is not good. That is just not good. The matter is not a little \none. This is not a little matter. The American people know that \nimmigration is important to our country. They know it is deeply \nimportant to our country. They care about it. They have been watching \nit. They watch it nightly on television. They write letters to their \neditor. They call my office. They call other people's offices. They \ncomplain about what is going on and how we have done our business.\n  They have every right to complain. They have every right to complain.\n\n[[Page S7403]]\n\nWhy in the world would we ever suggest that somehow the American people \nare not generous and fair and decent when it comes to immigration? They \nreally are. We are a nation that believes in immigrants. We are a \nnation of immigrants. We believe in immigration.\n  But people are frustrated. Some people say things that are harsh \nmaybe about immigrants, but when you listen to most people, the anger \nthat they are expressing is not at the immigrants, it is at those of us \nin Washington. It is at a string of Presidents, it is at a series of \nCongresses that have failed, refused to do what they asked them to do.\n  And what have the American people asked? They have asked that we \ncreate a lawful system of immigration and we create a policy of \nimmigration that is in the national interest of the United States of \nAmerica, that we allow a number of people to come in every year, that \nwe make a rational judgment about how many that should be. People \nshould not come in illegally. They should come in in accordance with \nlaw. And if they come in illegally, they expect the Government to stop \nthem or apprehend them and deport them.\n  What is wrong with that? Is that harsh? Is it mean-spirited to say \nthat we need to have a legitimate legal system involving immigration in \nthis country? I suggest not. I have been looking at the numbers. I \nthink it is adversely impacting the wages of working Americans. And I \nam prepared to debate it. But regardless, this is a matter we need to \ndeal with. We are going to maintain a flow of legal immigrants into our \ncountry, and we should. We should set up a system that identifies \npeople who are most worthy of coming into our country and approve them \nin a meritorious way, in an effective system.\n  We do not have that today. The bill we have passed pretends to be a \ncomprehensive bill for immigration reform, and it is an utter failure. \nIt should never, ever, ever become law. It is a total disaster. They \nsay: Well, we will just send it over to the House. The same people who \nmay well vote against funding this amendment say: We will just send \nthis bill now over to the House, the House of Representatives, who they \nmade fun of a few months ago for passing a border enforcement bill \nfirst. We will send it over there, and maybe we will fix all this.\n\n  How does it work in conference? The majority leader of the Senate \nappoints a group of conferees, the Speaker of the House does, the \nDemocratic leaders in the House and the Senate appoint conferees, and \nthis group of hand-picked Senators and Congressmen meet. They go meet \nsomeplace, and they work it all out, basically in secret, without any \nreal input from the American people.\n  We have a bill from the Senate that has comprehensive review and \nreform, so-called, of the entire immigration policy of the United \nStates of America and the House of Representatives has a law \nenforcement security bill only. And these are going to be just written \nout of thin air by these hand-picked people in secret? I don't think \nthat is healthy, not on a matter this important.\n  Let me ask you, do the American people have a right to expect that \nthis Senate and the House of Representatives are going to protect their \ninterests and do what they have been asking them to do for 30 years. Or \ndo they have a right to be cynical and expect that they will meet, plot \nout some sort of immigration bill, trumpet it as solving all our \nproblems, bring it on the floor of this Senate, not subject to \namendment, and drive it through and pass it? And it will not work again \njust like 1986.\n  How can you test what we do here? How can the American people have a \ntest of this Senate? I submit to you, one way is to watch the vote on \nthe funding of the enforcement issues that are dealt with in the \namendments I have offered.\n  So let's see. Are we going to pass a fence amendment or not? If we \npass it, maybe we are beginning to get serious over here. But even that \ncan be fixed in conference. That is not the final passage of the bill. \nThey can still go into conference and take it out. But it would be a \nstep.\n  I say this to my colleagues: If we vote down funding the agents, the \nfencing, the detention beds that we have authorized in this bill, why \nshouldn't the American people really look at us askance? Why shouldn't \nthey say: they just authorized it, and they are not even going to fund \nthis fence? They are not even going to add the agents? They are not \ngoing to even add the bed spaces? I think that is what the American \npeople are going to ask. And the truth is, they are correct.\n  Now, some will say: Well, we don't have the money. We don't have the \nmoney? We spend over $2 trillion a year in this country. What do you \nmean we don't have the money? We could do a ``Cadillac'' program for $2 \nbillion or $3 billion. That is a lot of money. We are spending $100 \nbillion on hurricane relief, $85 billion, in the supplemental, on the \nwar.\n  Let me tell you some other things we spend money on in this country, \nwhen people say we don't have the money to do what the American people \nare demanding that we do: According to the Congressional Budget \nOffice--this is from March 2006--spending for Social Security, \nMedicare, and Medicaid alone is expected to increase by $106 billion \nfrom 2006 to 2007, a 9.5-percent increase. It is a 9.5-percent increase \nin Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid alone, with the increase \ntotaling $106 billion. And we can't find $1 billion or $2 billion to \nmake the border secure? Give me a break.\n  Defense spending: We spent $76.8 billion in 2005 on that. How about \n$32 billion to fund this Department, the whole Department of Homeland \nSecurity? The bill budget for the Department of Homeland Security is \n$32 billion. We cannot find another $1 billion or $2 billion to follow \nthrough on the commitments we made to make the immigration system in \nthis country lawful? And within that Department of Homeland Security \nmoney is all the funding they will get. It is all the money we are \ngoing to get to increase immigration enforcement efforts. It is just \nnot there. In this appropriations, the money has not been funded to \nmeet the authorizations we passed and made a commitment to.\n  I am not here to break the budget. I am tired of that. I know the \nPresiding Officer is. He has fought harder than anybody I know in this \nSenate to bring integrity to spending, and I have been pleased to \nsupport him. But I will tell you, he has been a breath of fresh air and \na great addition to the Senate. He has called our attention to the \nwasteful spending we carry on in this body on a regular basis. We \ncannot afford everything. We are paid to set priorities.\n  Has anybody ever listened to the people in their States about what \nthey want us to do? I am telling you, they want us to make the \nimmigration system a legal one, not a lawless one. They want us to \nspend the money that is necessary--no more but they want to spend \nwhatever it takes. That is a priority with the American people. It \nshould be a priority of those of us who are here because they are \nright. In the scheme of things, the money we spend is not that great, \nbut it is important for us to do it correctly.\n  I will be offering amendments that will deal with five different \nareas. Those amendments will be offset, will not add additional \nspending to the budget or increase the debt in any way. We will set \nsome priorities. We will set some choices. That is what the people pay \nus to do.\n  What do we need? We need strategic fencing and vehicle barriers at \nthe border. We need an interior investigative agent increase--that is \nfor the ICE agents, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents--to \nincrease worksite enforcement. We need to increase the detention bed \nspaces.\n  Detention beds are critical. The reason is, we still are carrying out \na catch-and-release policy. What do you mean ``catch-and-release''? \nThis is what happens: Someone comes into the country from a country, \nsay, other than Mexico. They are referred to as OTMs, other than \nMexicans--Brazil, Central America, South America, Asia--and they are \napprehended here illegally.\n  What happens then? Well, you say: They try them and deport them. \nWrong. Not really. What has been happening is, these particular people \nwho are apprehended in this country illegally are not from Mexico, so \nthey cannot be readily taken back across the border. They are then \ndetained and then given a trial date. Since there are\n\n[[Page S7404]]\n\nno bed spaces, they do not have a place to keep them. What do they do? \nThey release them on bail. They catch them and they release them on \nbail. They sign their name because they do not have any money to put up \nfor the bail. They just allow them a signature bond, and they are asked \nto come back at a certain date to have their trial on whether or not \nthey are going to be deported.\n  How many do you think come back? They have already entered the \ncountry illegally. They are apprehended and released. They do not come \nback for trial. One reporter did an interesting article that showed \nthat 95 percent did not show up. What a joke that is. The only way to \nend the catch-and-release problem is to have enough detention beds so \nthey could be detained until they could be deported from the country.\n  Secretary Chertoff is making some progress in this regard but not \nenough. We will never get there without some more beds. So if we are \nserious about making a legal system here work, then we need more bed \nspaces.\n  Everybody says we need worksite enforcement. We have a pilot program \nthat has been played with for a number of years that is supposed to \nwork. It really has the potential to work, but it is not working today. \nWe need some more money for that to make that system work. If you don't \nwant the workplace enforcement system to work and you are President of \nthe United States, you don't ask for funding for a program that will \nwork, and if you are a Member of Congress, you don't vote for the money \nto make the program work. If you are part of Homeland Security, you \ndon't come and demand money so you can make it work. Everybody's hands \nare dirty on workplace enforcement. We know that. Let's be frank about \nit.\n  We need agents. You have to have law enforcement agents. Those law \nenforcement agents can have a tremendous impact on the worksite. It \ndoes not take that many prosecutions, frankly, to have a complete \nchange in behavior. I strongly say we need that.\n  We need to protect the funds that were already appropriated for \nsection 287(g). The 287(g) program is the cooperative immigration \nenforcement effort with State and local law enforcement. The Department \nof Homeland Security has this program. They train local law \nenforcement. They set up abilities to work together. If they apprehend \nsomeone for speeding and find out they are here illegally, then they \ncall the agents and they can transfer them for processing and \ndeportation. Wouldn't we want to see that happen? Wouldn't we want to \ntake the help of State and local law enforcement agencies? Well, we \ndon't have the money for that. We put the money in. It was in there for \na while. Now they have spent it on something else. It is a bargain, a \nreal bargain to do that.\n  Finally, we need to fully implement the exit portion of the US-VISIT \nsystem to track visitors who leave the country as well as when they \ncome in. That is what the system was set up to do. We have been working \non it for 10 years. It has not been completed, they say, because of \nvarious problems.\n  Let's be frank. It hasn't been completed because Congress and the \nPresident over the last 10 or 15 years have not wanted it completed. \nThere has been plenty of time to complete it. Agencies hadn't come \nforward and demanded the money necessary. They haven't told us what \nthey needed. The President hasn't put it in his budget, and Congress \nhasn't spent the money. So it hasn't been completed. That is just it. I \ndon't know any other way to say it.\n  We now can track people when they come in the country, and we need a \ngood biometric card so people can enter really easily. If they have a \nlegal right to come, they present their card. It clears immediately. \nThey come right on through. If they work in the United States a week, \nthey can go home and see their family, come back on Sunday or Monday, \ntravel back and forth. They can do all those things.\n  We would like to see this system work. It can work. We are close to \nit, but we don't have the exit system working. Unless the exit system \nworks, you have no idea of who is in the country and who has stayed, \nwho did not go home when they were supposed to.\n  That is where we are. We will have some of those votes tomorrow. I \ndon't mean to be unfair in my comments or unduly harsh, but the truth \nis the American people are watching us this time. They saw what \nhappened in 1986. They don't want that to happen again. We should not \nwant that to happen again. We should do what we promised to do. We \nshould follow through and fund the projects that we have authorized. \nWhen we authorized these projects, we knew they were necessary to make \nthis system move from a lawless system, a system that makes a mockery \nof law, to a lawful, decent system. It can be done. It actually can be \ndone. It will not take an excessive amount of money, but it will take a \nsignificant amount of money.\n  Then there will be a tipping point. When people find out that the way \nto come in and work in the United States is to have a biometric card to \ncome lawfully, that will be successful. If they wait in line, they can \nwork. When they find out they can't get a job and it is very hard to \nget across the border, maybe impossible almost to come illegally across \nthe border, they will quit coming illegally. When they can't get a job \nand it is too hard to get across the border, they will decide then to \nwait in line and get their card and come and work in due course \nlawfully. Right now the system is a mockery of the law. It is not \nworking. Let's fix that.\n  When we vote tomorrow, we will send a signal to all those people back \nhome that we are committed now to creating a lawful system of \nimmigration. We are going to follow through and put up the money, a \nsignificant amount of money, but in the scheme of the size of the \nUnited States budget, it is a very small amount to make this system \nwork.\n  If you went back home and asked the American people, do you want to \nsee us follow through, do you want to spend a few more billion dollars, \n$2 to $3 billion--that would be super; maybe we could do it for less \nthan that--a couple billion dollars more than what we are spending \ntoday to make us move from a lawless system to a lawful system, they \nwould say: Do it--in a heartbeat.\n  That is where we are headed. I thank the Presiding Officer for his \nleadership and commitment to creating a lawful system of immigration \nfor the United States.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I supported Senator Clinton's amendment \nto restore FEMA to Cabinet-level rank and establish it once again as an \nindependent agency. In the early 1990s, as the chair of the \nAppropriations Subcommittee on VA-HUD, we funded FEMA. Senator Garn, my \nwonderful colleague, was my ranking member. We found that FEMA was a \nCold War relic, and we went to work on a bipartisan basis, transforming \nit from a relic of the Cold War into a professional, prepared, all-\nhazards agency.\n  Hurricane Katrina was the storm we all feared. In the hours and days \nafter Hurricane Katrina, like all of you I watched in disbelief and \nabsolute frustration. Why? At the Federal Government's befuddled and \nboondoggled response blowing it. The people in our Gulf Coast States \nwere doubly victimized first by the hurricane, second by the slow and \nsluggish response of our Government. And I thought: How like Hugo. How \nlike Andrew. I didn't know about Betsy.\n  So this, of course, has prompted reform. Well, back in 1989 when we \ntook a look at this, what did I see? What I found out as I took over \nthe chairmanship of that subcommittee was that FEMA was a Cold War \nagency. It focused only on worrying about if we were hit with a nuclear \nattack. It was out of date, out of touch, and riddled with political \nhacks. If you had to give someone a favor job, whether it was at the \nFederal level or the State level, put them in civil defense. It was \ncalled civil defense. And many of us in my generation remember where we \nused to practice by hiding under those desks if war came. Well that is \nthe way the bureaucrats were. Any time there was a question, they hid \nunder their desk. So we set about reform. They were focused on \nsomething called continuity of Government. It was incompetent \nleadership. They had ridiculous ideas. In the event of a nuclear war--\nstop first at the post office and leave your forwarding address to \nthese three shelters. So you get a sense of what it was like.\n  But Senator Garn and I looked at it. And then what happened was \nHurricane Hugo hit the Carolinas, particularly\n\n[[Page S7405]]\n\nSouth Carolina. FEMA's response was very poor. The military had to come \nin to get power back up in Charleston. The people went for over a week \nwithout basic functions. Sound familiar? Our former colleague Senator \nHollings had to call the President's Chief of Staff, John Sununu, to \nget help and call the head of the Joint Chiefs, then General Colin \nPowell, just to get generators from the Army. It was like cats and \ncharmer cops. Are you in charge? No, I am not in charge. They had the \ngenerators but didn't ask. It was all of that. In the meantime, there \nwas no water, no utilities in Charleston. We began then to begin to \nexamine what steps to take in reform.\n  Then along the way we were hit with Andrew. Andrew, again, was the \nworst disaster. Yet FEMA's response was so bad and they were so inept \nthat President Bush I sent Andy Card, then Secretary of Transportation, \nto take over. I remember seeing a woman named Katie Hale saying, \n``Where the hell is the cavalry on this one? We need food. We need \nwater. We need people.''\n  Having said all that, it was very clear to Senator Garn and me. Our \njob was to protect lives, protect people, and now of course protect the \nhomeland. Working with Garn, and then Senator Bond, we worked to change \nit. We commissioned three studies, and I ask you to go take a look at \nthem. One was a GAO study, the other was a National Academy of Public \nAdministration, and then FEMA's own inspector general.\n  We looked at all of this, and we wanted to be able to prevent, do all \nwe could for prevention, and do what we could to respond. Our goals \nthen were: First of all, FEMA has to be professionalized. They need a \nprofessional director and a professional staff. Whoever runs FEMA has \nto have a background in crisis management, either to come from \nemergency response at the State level, the way James Lee Witt or Joe \nAllbaugh did, or from the military or private sector where they have \ndone crisis management and know how to organize large numbers of \npeople. But not only professionalized Washington but insist there be \nprofessionals at each State level. And I would emphasize reform must \nalso be directed at the States. No matter how good James Lee Witt was, \nno matter how dedicated Joe Allbaugh was, if they didn't have the State \nfunctioning well, it wouldn't work. As we know, the genius of our \nsystem is that each State will have a different type of threat. The \nterrain is different, the threat is different. And they need to be \nready. So the professionalization and the way was that each State \nsubmit a plan. If you don't do the right plan and do tabletops, you are \nnot going to get the money. I think you have to have a muscular way to \nhave State plans in place with professional people and where there are \nbenchmarks for measurement and then use the ultimate withholding. That \nis tough, but let me tell you, it works. So that is why we go for the \nprofessionalization of FEMA.\n  We focused on it being a risk-based agency--that means prepared for \nany risk that affects the risk base--because we thought then that the \nthreat of the Cold War was coming to an end. The wall was coming down \nin Berlin, but the wall wasn't coming down in the Federal bureaucracy. \nSo we said, what are the risks? The threat is natural disasters. And \nour States--we are coastal Senators, I share a coast with my colleague \nfrom Delaware--we are threatened by hurricanes. Soon as June comes, we \nare on our hurricanes readiness again--regardless of what the threat \nis. And now it is even more important because it could be an earthquake \nin California, a tornado in the Midwest, or, of course, a terrorist \nattack.\n  Next, be ready for all hazards. And again, it is the States that get \nready with Washington offering the command and control and the ultimate \nbackup of sending in the calvary should the States collapse. All \nhazards need to be prepared like when we had a fire in the Baltimore \ntunnel--we didn't know if it was predatory or not. A hazardous chemical \nspill, a hurricane, a tornado or even a dirty bomb.\n  If we practice the three R's, of readiness, meaning if we are ready, \nand we are ready at the State level, then we can respond where the \nthreat occurs and then you have the infrastructure ready for recovery. \nWe were able to put the State plans, professionalize the agency, in \nplace.\n  What was never really ultimately addressed, though, is the Federal \nbackup if there is a complete collapse. That is something I believe \nneeds to be very carefully examined because of two things: No. 1, I \nrecall Governor Giles of Florida when Andrew hit. He said: We need NASA \nsatellites to tell me what my coast line looks like. We can't even call \nthe first responders. The firehouses are underwater. And you know all \nof the great tragedies that you have heard. There does come a time when \nthere is only the Federal Government that can bring in, under some kind \nof doctrine of mutual aid, really come in and provide the resources \nnecessary. We lost cities--we have never lost an entire city, except \nback to Betsy.\n\n  That has to be dealt with. The other is the role of the Vice \nPresident in our earlier recommendation. The Vice President always \nbacks the President up, but in a big disaster, like when the big ones \nhit, the Vice President should move to the Situation Room and really \ntake charge, to make sure the Governors can handle the job, that the \nGovernors next to the States affected can provide mutual aid, and so \non, because it is also an appropriate role for the Vice President \nshould the President be out of the country. The Vice President would be \nprepared and also, should the Vice President ever have to take over for \nany reason, would know the complete working of the FEMA disaster plans \nand how it should work. There are those other questions, too, of legal \nauthority when the Government takes over. Our three R's have to be \nreadiness, response, recovery. To do that we have to have \nprofessionalization, risk-based, all hazards.\n  You know, hurricanes are predictable. Terrorist attacks are not. And \nwe have to be ready. Colleagues, I am concerned that whether it is \navian flu or another hurricane getting ready for the season or \nsomething else, we don't know the answer, Who is in charge? That \nquestion has never been answered. Who manages the disaster? And most of \nall, who manages the panic around that? And who speaks? Your health \ncommittee members have just done a tabletop on bioterrorism. It is the \nsame.\n  So I believe, No. 1, FEMA ought to be an independent agency. No. 2, \nmaybe we need a disaster response agency, which handles this. But I \nalso think we need to take a look at what would be our response and how \nwe would handle these others, like avian flu. Are we going to call FEMA \nin? Is FEMA going to be avian flu? I don't know if we have to respond, \nbut I don't think so. I would hope not. But should we have a new \nframework for that? What are the legal authorities? Can a President \nsupersede a Governor if necessary? These are the big questions. But I \nbelieve we can create the right infrastructure. We can be ready for the \nnatural disasters, and so on.\n  I am going to conclude by saying that when we work together, and I \ndon't mean just us, but really work--we know how we have worked with \nDelaware. Just a couple of months ago, there was a terrible accident in \na factory in West Virginia. The closest search and rescue team with \nhelicopters was in Maryland with our State police. But because they had \nworked together, because they had trained together, because they knew \neach other, could talk to each other, trusted each other, my wonderful \nMaryland State troopers were able to go fly that 90 miles. The Coast \nGuard was too far away, this up near our Appalachian region. In the \npitch blackness, with power lines around them when they couldn't see, \nthey went down and were able to rescue two, and for the third they \nweren't sure whether he was going to get in the little basket that they \nhave, but they stayed to make sure they were going to leave no one \nbehind. Our State troopers did it, but they did it because they were \nprofessional, they were trained, they had worked together, they had \ntrusted.\n  That is what they did that terrible night in West Virginia. It should \nbe a model of what we need. Let's work together, train together, and \ntrust each other. And that is why I supported this amendment to restore \nFEMA to Cabinet-level rank and establish it again as an independent \nagency\n\n\n                  northern border air wing initiative\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to enter into a colloquy with \nmy\n\n[[Page S7406]]\n\nfriend from West Virginia, Senator Byrd, regarding funds that have been \nincluded in Senator Byrd's amendment for Customs and Border Protection, \nCBP, air and marine interdiction, operations, maintenance, and \nprocurement.\n  The northern border air wing, NBAW, initiative was launched by the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, DHS, 2004 to provide air and marine \ninterdiction and enforcement capabilities along the northern border. \nOriginal plans called for DHS to open five NBAW sites in New York, \nWashington, North Dakota, Montana, and Michigan.\n  The New York and Washington NBAW sites have been operational since \n2004. Unfortunately, not all of the sites have yet been established, \nleaving large portions of our northern border unpatrolled from the air \nand, in the case of my home State, the water. In the conference report \naccompanying the fiscal year 2006 DHS appropriations bill, the \nconferees noted that these remaining gaps in our air patrol coverage of \nthe northern border should be closed as quickly as possible.\n  Given that the threat from terrorists, drug traffickers, and others \nwho seek to enter our country illegally has not diminished, I believe \napproximately $12 million of the funds included in Senator Byrd's \namendment for air and marine interdiction, operations, maintenance, and \nprocurement should be used by Customs and Border Protection to complete \nthe remaining activities necessary to prepare, equip, and establish the \nMichigan NBAW site as Secretary Chertoff has indicated he would like to \nbe able to do.\n  In an April 11, 2006, letter to me, Secretary Chertoff indicated that \nit was his Department's plan to open the Michigan site during the 2007 \nfiscal year, and the Byrd amendment will enable the Department to stick \nto its schedule. Mr. President, I will ask that Secretary Chertoff's \nletter and enclosures, my letter to the Secretary, and a colloquy from \nearlier this year be printed in the Record.\n  Mr. BYRD. I agree with my friend from Michigan. I understand that \nSecretary Chertoff has said that the establishment of the final \nnorthern border air wings will be completed in fiscal year 2007. These \nfunds will help the Secretary meet his goal. My amendment, which was \ncosponsored by the chairman of our subcommittee and adopted unanimously \nby the Senate yesterday, provides $105 million for air and marine \ninterdiction, operations, maintenance, and procurement. Certainly, $12 \nmillion of those funds could go to Michigan for the establishment of \nthis important and final northern border air wing. I will work with the \nchairman in conference to ensure that the border security funds are \nretained in conference.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the aforementioned \nmaterials be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              Department of Homeland Security,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 11, 2006.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Levin: Thank you for your letter from March \n     10, 2006 in which you requested clarification on the \n     Department of Homeland Security's plan for the opening of \n     additional Northern Border Air Wing sites in Fiscal Years \n     2006 and 2007. The Department is committed to enhancing our \n     Northern Border security through the establishment of the \n     needed air wings just as soon as the ground infrastructure, \n     air assets, and experienced personnel can be made available. \n     Consistent with my earlier testimony, the activation of the \n     Montana air wing at Great Falls is well underway and should \n     be completed by the end of this fiscal year. In Fiscal Year \n     2007, our objective remains the activation of the Michigan \n     site and the initiation of activity on the site in North \n     Dakota. This will give us a limited presence at all five of \n     the primary Northern Border Air Wing sites by the year's end.\n       Based on the operational experience gained on the Northern \n     Border and our continuing evaluation of available \n     intelligence, we will add or relocate air assets and \n     personnel among the five sites to provide the most \n     comprehensive patrol coverage and to support ground \n     interdiction operations. We may also establish a series of \n     secondary air sites and/or deploy unmanned aerial vehicles \n     along our border to enhance air coverage.\n       We have developed a fully integrated aviation plan that is \n     undergoing review within the Department. The plan details our \n     long-range objectives for enhancing border security through \n     the use of our air force and how we intend to achieve the \n     objectives over time. We look forward to sharing the plan \n     with Congress as soon as the review is complete. I believe \n     that the plan will underscore both the extensive work \n     accomplished to date and the challenges that face us. For \n     now, please find enclosed our responses to your specific \n     questions.\n       Thank you for your continuing support of our efforts to \n     secure our borders. If we may be of further assistance, \n     please contact the Department's Office of Legislative and \n     Intergovernmental Affairs at (202) 205-4412.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Michael Chertoff,\n     Secretary.\n                                  ____\n\n       Questions to Secretary Michael Chertoff from the Honorable \n     Carl Levin, United States Senate, dated March 10, 2006:\n       1. Will new Northern Border Air Wing Sites be established \n     in Michigan and North Dakota during FY07?\n       a. When will specific sites in Michigan and North Dakota be \n     selected?\n       b. When do you predict step sisters will be operational?\n       Response: Yes, the Department will begin the activation \n     process for new air sites in both Detroit, Michigan and the \n     Grand Forks area of North Dakota in FY 2007. The site survey \n     for Detroit has been completed and preliminary work to assess \n     hangar, maintenance, and support facility requirements is \n     ongoing. Air assets are being identified for transfer to the \n     site and staffing plans are being compiled. The FY 2006 \n     appropriation provided $2 million for the North Dakota site \n     assessment, which is in progress and should be completed in \n     late May 2006. The relocation of air assets and experienced \n     personnel for both sites remains a challenge, and the \n     Department will have to close smaller, less valuable, \n     interior sites to su port the Northern Border site \n     activations. This should enable the Department to establish \n     initial presence at both sites by the end of FY 2007.\n       2. Does the President's FY07 budget request for DHS include \n     funding for the opening of Northern Border Air Wing sites in \n     Michigan and North Dakota?\n       a. If so, how much money has been budgeted for the opening \n     of the sites?\n       Response: The current cost to fully activate a single air \n     wing site is approximately $17 million ($12 million for \n     infrastructure, operations, and maintenance; $5 million for \n     staffing salaries and relocations), depending on specific \n     site requirements and other factors. The Department is \n     currently developing funding options to support the site \n     activations.\n       3. What criteria were used to determine the order of \n     Northern Border Air Wing sites to be opened?\n       Response: The order in which the border sites are activated \n     was based on the known level of aviation, marine, and ground \n     activity in each geographical area, combined with available \n     intelligence on the threat. This resulted in Bellingham, WA \n     and Plattsburgh, NY being activated first, with Great Falls, \n     MT and Detroit, MI to be activated second. Grand Forks, ND \n     was identified as the last of the primary sites to be \n     established.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington DC, March 10, 2006.\n     Hon. Michael Chertoff,\n     Secretary, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Mr. Secretary: I am writing to request clarification \n     of the Department of Homeland Security's plans for opening \n     additional Northern Border Air Wing sites to complement the \n     current sites in Bellingham, Washington and Plattsburg, New \n     York. You have testified before the Senate Homeland Security \n     and Governmental Affairs Committee on several occasions that \n     the Department plans to open sites in Michigan, Montana, and \n     North Dakota in Fiscal Years (FY) 2006 and 2007. I strongly \n     support the Northern Border Air Wing initiative and look \n     forward to all five Northern Border Air Wing sites becoming \n     operational in the coming years.\n       During your testimony before the Senate Homeland Security \n     and Governmental Affairs Committee on March 1, 2006, you \n     indicated to the Committee that the Northern Border Air Wing \n     site in Montana would open in FY06, followed by the North \n     Dakota and Michigan sites in FY07. However, an analysis of \n     the President's FY07 budget request for DHS does not seem to \n     support your testimony since there are no funds designated \n     for the establishment of Northern Border Air Wing sites in \n     either North Dakota or Michigan.\n       In light of these discrepancies, I would appreciate your \n     response to the following questions:\n       (1.) Will new Northern Border Air Wing sites be established \n     in Michigan and North Dakota during FY07?\n       a. When will specific sites in Michigan and North Dakota be \n     selected?\n       b. When do you predict these sites will be operational?\n       (2.) Does the President's FY07 budget request for DHS \n     include funding for the opening of Northern Border Air Wing \n     sites in Michigan and North Dakota?\n       a. If so, how much money has been budgeted for the opening \n     of these sites?\n       (3.) What criteria were used to determine the order of \n     Northern Border Air Wing sites to be opened?\n       A Northern Border Air Wing site in Michigan will provide an \n     additional layer of air and marine border security along a \n     critical section of our Northern Border. The region for which \n     the Michigan site will be responsible encompasses at least \n     three of our Great\n\n[[Page S7407]]\n\n     Lakes and several major ports along the St. Lawrence Seaway \n     including Detroit, Cleveland, Chicago, Milwaukee, and Green \n     Bay. In addition, Southeast Michigan is home to three of our \n     nation's busiest border crossings and an unparalleled \n     industrial base vital to our economy and national security. I \n     hope you agree that the establishment of a Northern Border \n     Air Wing site in Michigan is a national priority and I would \n     appreciate your timely response to the above questions.\n       Should your staff have any questions, please feel free to \n     have them contact Michael Noblet of my staff at (202) 224-\n     3999.\n           Sincerely,\n     Carl Levin.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                     customs and border protection\n\n       Mr. LEVIN. I would like to enter into a colloquy with my \n     friend from New Hampshire, Senator Gregg, and my friend from \n     North Dakota, Senator Conrad, regarding funds that have been \n     included in this bill for customs and border protection, CBP, \n     air and marine interdiction, operations, maintenance, and \n     procurement.\n       The Northern Border Air Wing, NBAW, initiative was launched \n     by the Department of Homeland Security, DHS, in 2004 to \n     provide air and marine interdiction and enforcement \n     capabilities along the Northern Border. Original plans called \n     for DHS to open five NBAW sites in New York, Washington, \n     North Dakota, Montana, and Michigan.\n       The New York and Washington NBAW sites have been \n     operational since 2004. Unfortunately, none of the other \n     three sites have yet been stood up, leaving large portions of \n     our Northern Border unpatrolled from the air. In the \n     conference report accompanying the fiscal year 2006 DHS \n     appropriations bill, the conferees noted that these remaining \n     gaps in our air patrol coverage of the northern border should \n     be closed as quickly as possible.\n       Given that the threat from terrorists, drug traffickers, \n     and others who seek to enter our country illegally has not \n     diminished, I believe an adequate portion of the funds \n     included in this bill for air and marine interdiction, \n     operations, maintenance, and procurement should be used by \n     customs and border protection to complete the remaining \n     assessments, evaluations, and other activities necessary to \n     prepare and equip the Michigan, North Dakota, and Montana \n     NBAW sites with appropriate CBP air and marine assets.\n       This bill requires that DHS submit an expenditure plan to \n     the appropriations committee before any of the funds may be \n     obligated. I urge DHS to include in their plan the funds \n     necessary to stand up, equip, and begin operations at the \n     three remaining northern border air wing sites in Michigan, \n     North Dakota, and Montana.\n       Mr. CONRAD. I agree with my friend from Michigan. The \n     fiscal year 2006 DHS appropriations bill included a small \n     amount of funds to begin initial preparations for a NBAW site \n     in my home state of North Dakota, but more funds are needed \n     for the site to become operational. Secretary Chertoff has \n     told us that the establishment of the three additional \n     northern border air wings will be complete in fiscal year \n     2007.\n       A small portion of the air and marine interdiction funds in \n     this bill would go a long way toward meeting this deadline \n     and the goal of securing our long and currently porous \n     northern border. I join Senator Levin in encouraging the DHS \n     to include funds sufficient to stand up and equip the North \n     Dakota, Michigan, and Montana sites.\n       Mr. GREGG. My friends from Michigan and North Dakota raise \n     important points. I agree the establishment and equipping of \n     the three remaining northern border air wings is a priority. \n     The northern border has long been neglected compared to the \n     southern border. As my colleagues are aware, funds were \n     appropriated in the fiscal year 2006 Department of Homeland \n     Security Appropriations Act to initiate funding of the third \n     northern border air wing in North Dakota. I am committed to \n     seeing that the establishment of the remaining northern \n     border air wings is accomplished as expeditiously as possible\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeMint). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/12/senate-section/article/S7407-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7407]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, this morning in the Washington Post there \nwas an article announcing a decision by the Defense Department that \nrelates to something I have held a good many hearings on through the \nDemocratic Policy Committee in the past several years. We have been \nholding hearings on waste, fraud, and abuse with respect to the very \nlarge sole-source contracts that have been given to certain companies \nto do business in Iraq and provide food and fuel and logistics support \nfor our troops. What we have discovered is very substantial waste, \nfraud and abuse.\n  This morning, finally, the Washington Post says: ``The Army to End \nExpansive, Exclusive Halliburton Deal. Logistics Contract to be Open \nfor Bidding.'' One of the side bars of the story talks about: \n``Whistle-blowers told how the company charged $45 per case of soda, \ndouble-billed on meals, and allowed troops to bathe in contaminated \nwater.'' All of these were issues given us to us by whistle-blowers who \ncame to our Committee to testify because there was virtually no \noversight on these issues by the other Committees.\n  The decision to terminate these sole-source contracts is long \noverdue. Sole-source contracts are contracts that are, in my judgment, \ninvitations for abuse. The bill that I introduced some months ago, \nalong with 30 other Senators, called S. 2361, the Honest Leadership and \nAccountability in Contracting Act of 2006, is a piece of legislation \nthat insists on this exact provision, but goes much, much further--the \nprovision that says we ought to break up these contracts and have them \ncompeted for so that the competition for contracts will give the \ntaxpayers some feeling they are not being cheated.\n  A fellow named Henry Bunting testified at a hearing we held. He was a \nwhistle-blower. He actually worked for Halliburton in Kuwait. His job \nin Kuwait was to purchase hand towels for American soldiers. So he got \na requisition to buy hand towels for American soldiers, and he would \norder the hand towels. But then he was told: No, we don't want you to \norder those hand towels; we want you to order new hand towels. He \nbrought a sample of the hand towels with him. The reason they wanted \nhim to order different hand towels is they wanted the company name to \nbe embroidered on the hand towels, which tripled the cost of the towels \nfor the taxpayers.\n  No one would have believed that soldiers need to have hand towels \nwith the embroidered name of the contractor providing the hand towels. \nThat is exactly what happened. And it is exactly what the whistle-\nblowers told us was happening with respect to procurement.\n  This whistle-blower, who worked with the company, said: This is \nsomething my supervisor said we are going to do, and we did it. He \nsaid: We saw $8,500-a-month SUV rentals. We saw $40, $45 a case for \nCoca-Cola\n  It is pretty unbelievable when you hear all of the stories. Those \nstories come from giving billions of dollars of contracts to one \ncompany. That is what has happened on contracts called LOGCAP and RIO, \nand finally the Pentagon suggests maybe it is going to shut these down \nand require competition.\n  Looking forward, I am going to ask the Pentagon to consider all of \nthe information that we have uncovered in these hearings, because \nprovisions in defense contracting require that you hold companies \naccountable for actions they have taken in the past, when you consider \nnew bids for the future.\n  It is interesting that this also relates to something that is now \nhappening in the Pentagon. The woman who testified before the \ncommittee--there has been a great deal of discussion about her--was \nBunny Greenhouse, the top civilian contracting official in the Corps of \nEngineers at the Pentagon. She rose to the top. Every performance \nevaluation said she was the best. People outside the Government who had \ndealt with her said she was the best, professional, knew what she was \ndoing. She said:\n\n       I can unequivocally state that the abuse related to \n     contracts awarded to KBR--\n\n  That is Halliburton--\n\n     represents the most blatant and improper contract abuse I \n     have witnessed during the course of my professional career.\n\n  This woman was honest and public about what she saw. She was demoted. \nShe lost her job. That job has now been filled by someone else, someone \nwho has 40 years experience with the Government but has no contracting \nexperience. A person with 20 years contracting experience, the highest \ncivilian official in the Corps of Engineers\n\n[[Page S7408]]\n\nloses her job to be replaced by someone who is now being sent to school \nbecause she doesn't know contracting.\n  This is happening at a time when we hear these stories of $85,000 \ntrucks left by the side of the road to be burned because of a flat \ntire--the taxpayer is paying for it; it doesn't matter--25 tons of \nnails, 50,000 pounds of nails ordered, wrong size, throw them in the \nsand. Want to find 25 tons of nails? They are in the sand in Iraq, paid \nfor by the American taxpayer.\n  Where is the accountability? It is unbelievable the amount of waste \nthat has existed. And the one person who had the courage to talk about \nit publicly lost her job. That is still the subject of a great deal of \nangst in the Pentagon.\n  So yesterday the Pentagon announces that they are finally going to \nend sole-source contracts and require competitive bidding, and finally \nthe taxpayers appear to get a break. But this was several overdue.\n  There is more that needs to be done. One of the things the Pentagon \nhas apparently also decided to do is to outsource oversight. You can't \noutsource oversight. It has been tried before. They had companies that \nwere partners in contracts in other countries come into Iraq to provide \noversight over each other. You can't do that. You can't delegate \noversight, especially not to companies with conflicts of interest. The \noversight responsibility for spending the taxpayers' money is with the \nGovernment, not someone you hire that will have a patently obvious \nconflict of interest.\n  While the Pentagon is taking a step forward today in their \nannouncement about the ending of these sole-source contracts, they are \ntaking another step backward on this issue of deciding they are going \nto hire other companies to provide oversight to make sure the \ntaxpayers' money is being spent in the way anticipated. That makes no \nsense.\n  Here is another whistleblower account. Rory Mayberry worked in Iraq \nfor Halliburton. He worked in food service. He was the manager of a \nfood service that provided food to the troops. He came to us and said: \nWe had food that was date stamped expired. The Halliburton supervisors \nsaid: It doesn't matter, just feed to it the troops. And they said: By \nthe way, don't you dare talk to a Government auditor. If a Government \nauditor comes around and you talk to that person, either you will be \nfired or you will be sent to an area where there is hostile action. He \ntalked to a Government auditor. He was sent to Fallujah during the \nheight of the action there.\n  The stories are unbelievable. And finally, the Pentagon is taking a \nstep in the right direction in one area, stepping backward in another. \nBut I hope the Pentagon understands, when they open these contracts \ncalled the LOGCAP contract and the RIO contract, when they open these \ncontracts and finally insist that there be competition between \ncompanies in order to provide some safety for the American taxpayer and \nto be sure that we are getting what we are paying for, I hope they will \nunderstand that there has to be adequate oversight.\n  We have introduced legislation, myself and many of my colleagues, \ncalled the Honest Leadership and Accountability in Contracting. What \nthe Pentagon is doing today appears to be in line with one piece of it, \nand it is a step in the right direction. But much more needs to be \ndone.\n  I ask those in the Pentagon to take a look at what we will send to \nthem as a result of a number of hearings in which whistleblowers who \nhave worked for these contracts, particularly Halliburton that has \nreceived very large sole-source contracts worth billions of dollars \nwithout bidding, I would hope they would take a look at this and \nevaluate whether the performance is performance that is worthy of \nreceiving other contracts. The list is endless. I will not go over it \nagain.\n  This morning's announcement by the Pentagon is finally a recognition \nthat there needs to be competition. It is one step in the piece of \nlegislation I and many of my colleagues offered some months ago. My \nhope is they will finish the job and do what is necessary to give the \ntaxpayers full value and full measure for the money that is being spent \non these contracts.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/12/senate-section/article/S7408-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7408-S7409]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MIDSESSION BUDGET REVIEW\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, when the administration released its \nmidsession review of the fiscal year 2007 budget yesterday, it made a \nnumber of claims about how its policies have been successful at \npromoting economic growth and bringing down the budget deficit. In this \ncase, however, as in so many others, the administration is looking \nthrough rose-colored glasses, exaggerating the successes of its \npolicies and ignoring the true costs.\n  Let's begin by putting the improvement in the fiscal year 2006 budget \ndeficit in perspective. It is true that tax revenues have grown this \nyear--as they always do in a business cycle expansion--and that \nrevenues have been coming in stronger than expected. But the current \nprojected 2006 deficit of $296 billion is just a little lower than the \nfiscal year 2005 budget deficit of $318 billion. It is still the fourth \nlargest budget deficit on record in nominal terms.\n  The Bush administration wants us to compare the current estimate of \nthe fiscal year 2006 budget deficit with the exaggerated estimate of \n$423 billion they made in their February budget projection. As the \nnoted budget expert Stan Collender wrote at the time:\n\n       This President has a well-established history of \n     overstating the deficit early in the year and then taking \n     credit when it turns out to be lower than projected, even if \n     it has done nothing to make that happen.\n\n  And, of course, that is exactly what we are seeing right now.\n  The real story is the sharp deterioration of the budget in this \nadministration. When President Bush took office, the Congressional \nBudget Office projected large and growing Federal budget surpluses \nunder existing laws and policies--the so-called baseline projection--\nincluding a budget surplus of over $500 billion in fiscal year 2006. \nHowever, the President has presided over an incredible reversal of \nfortune. A $128 billion Federal budget surplus in fiscal year 2001 \nturned into a $318 billion deficit by fiscal year 2005 and a projected \ndeficit almost as large in fiscal year 2006. This is not news to crow \nabout. Frankly, it reveals, as I suggested, a tremendous reversal in \nthe budget fortunes of this country.\n  A $5.6 trillion, 10-year projected surplus from 2002 to 2011 has \nturned into a deficit of $2.7 trillion. So from the time the President \ntook office until today, what we thought was going to be a $5.6 \ntrillion surplus is now a $2.7 trillion deficit, an extraordinary \nchange in the fiscal year health of the United States.\n  Realistically, this 10-year deficit is probably much higher because \nit does not include big-ticket items such as the war costs which are \nbeing funded on supplemental appropriations and not properly projected \ninto the budget base; and the need to make tax adjustments like fixing \nthe alternative minimum tax.\n  Instead of sound budget policies aimed at preparing for the imminent \nretirement of the baby boom generation, the Bush administration and the \nmajority in Congress have refused to adopt the kinds of budget \nenforcement rules that helped achieve fiscal discipline in the 1990s. \nThey have pursued an open-ended commitment to stabilizing Iraq that \nrelies on supplemental appropriations rather than the normal budget \nprocess, and they have remained committed to extending irresponsible \ntax cuts that will add further to the budget deficit. All of this comes \nat the cost of inhibiting greater economic opportunities for most \nAmerican families.\n  That, of course, is not what we are hearing from the administration \nand its supporters who keep telling us that the economy is doing well, \nand that their tax cuts are an important reason why, and that everyone \nis benefiting. It should not be surprising that this is not a message \nwhich is resonating with the American people because, in fact, the \ncurrent economic recovery has been weaker than the typical business \ncycle recovery since the end of World War II, and large numbers of \nAmericans are still waiting to benefit from the economic growth that we \nare purportedly seeing.\n  Job growth has been very slow by the standards of past recoveries, \nreal wages are stagnating, and disparities in income and earnings are \ngrowing wider. Last Friday we learned that employers added only 121,000 \njobs to their payrolls\n\n[[Page S7409]]\n\nin June, and that employment growth over the past 3 months has averaged \njust 108,000 jobs per month. Those are not the kinds of figures you \nexpect to see in a healthy job market. They are not even enough to keep \nup with normal growth in the labor force.\n  You also don't expect to see the earnings of the typical worker \nfallin behind inflation year after year in a growing economy, but that \nis what has happened since 2003. Average hourly earnings have fallen in \neach of the past 2 years, and real median household income has declined \nby about $1,700 under President Bush.\n\n  The benefits of economic growth over the last several years are \nsimply not being shared fairly. Those at the upper income levels are \nseeing gains but, frankly, not the same robust gains of the 1990s, when \nwe saw the proverbial picket fence, where there were positive gains at \nevery level of income in the United States from the poorest to the \nrichest. Now, we are seeing a distribution of income that is skewed to \nthe very richest. At the bottom income and middle income level, there \nis a loss in real earnings since the President took office. They are \nnot even keeping up.\n  While wages have stagnated and incomes are falling for most workers, \nprofits have grown to record levels. Corporate profits have grown at an \nannual rate of over 16 percent, more than twice the average growth rate \nin past recoveries. Strong productivity growth has shown up on the \nbottom lines of shareholders, but not in the paychecks of workers.\n  It seems clear that investors are benefiting greatly from Bush \nadministration policies, but hard work goes unrewarded. Most Americans \ndepend on their salary, not their investments, to pay their bills. Too \nmany Americans are being squeezed by stagnant incomes and rising costs \nfor gasoline, health care, and education. Somehow, the Bush tax cuts \nare supposed to make up for this.\n  However, the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center estimates that the tax \ncuts passed this year will only save the typical American family about \n$47--about what it now costs to fill up the gas tank of their minivan. \nBut taxpayers making over $1 million will receive a tax cut of more \nthan $42,000--enough to buy a new Mercedes.\n  Ironically, the sources of the revenue surprises that have led to the \nimprovement in the fiscal year 2006 budget prospectus mirror the \ngrowing disparity between incomes at the top of the distribution and \nincomes for typical American families. Corporate tax receipts are \nsubstantially higher than originally projected, and much of the \nunexpected increase in individual income taxes appears to come from \nincome gains by high-income taxpayers.\n  In particular, tax receipts for income not automatically subject to \nwithholding, known as nonwithheld receipts, were 20 percent greater \nduring the first 9 months of 2006 compared to 2005. Nonwithheld income \nis not ordinary wages; it is income such as capital gains, executive \nbonuses, noncorporate business income, and interest on dividends.\n  Unfortunately, middle- and lower-income families are paying the price \nfor the President's tax cuts for the wealthiest, as investments in \nprograms that promote greater economic prosperity for ordinary \nAmericans have become candidates for budget cutting.\n  The President's budget includes cuts to elementary and secondary \neducation, student financial aid for higher education, job training for \ndisplaced workers, child care assistance so that parents can go to \nwork, and community development grants aimed at expanding small \nbusinesses.\n  Getting our fiscal house in order is the first step toward keeping \nour economy strong. But we also can't shortchange investments in \nresearch and technologies that will create the high-wage jobs of the \nfuture. Our policies should be refocused toward promoting lifelong \neducation and training for our citizens in order to allow Americans to \nincrease their earnings, their personal savings, and their ability to \nown a home.\n  Today, we are at war and yet there is no sense of the shared \nsacrifice that has united this country in past conflicts. Our military \nfamilies are making tremendous sacrifices, and too many of them have \nmade the ultimate sacrifice in service to our country.\n  With $320 billion appropriated or pending for Iraq operations to date \nand more than 2,500 service men and women killed, the human and \nfinancial tolls are both more staggering than imagined.\n  With mounting war costs, the impending retirement of the baby boom \ngeneration, and deficits as far as the eye can see, it is \nunconscionable to think that we are being asked to make the President's \nirresponsible tax cuts permanent. Those tax cuts were poorly designed \nto stimulate job creation and broadly shared prosperity when they were \nfirst passed, and they have produced a legacy of large budget deficits \nthat leave us increasingly hampered in our ability to deal with a host \nof challenges that we face as a Nation.\n  Large and persistent budget deficits have contributed to an ever-\nwidening trade deficit that forces us to borrow vast amounts from \nabroad and puts us at risk of a major financial collapse if foreign \nlenders suddenly stop accepting our IOUs. We had a current account \ndeficit of nearly $800 billion last year and our international \nfinancial debt continues to mount.\n  Raising our future standard of living and preparing adequately for \nthe retirement of the baby boom generation require that we have a high \nlevel of national investment and that a high fraction of that \ninvestment be financed by our own national saving--not by foreign \nborrowers. We followed such prosperity-enhancing policies under \nPresident Clinton, but that legacy of fiscal discipline has been \nsquandered under President Bush.\n  No matter how rosy a picture the administration tries to paint, \nneither the present nor the future fiscal outlook seems terribly \nbright. Instead of more tax cuts for the wealthiest among us, we need \nto invest more in hard-working families and create greater \nopportunities for every American. We cannot afford the costs of failing \nto meet that challenge\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/12/senate-section/article/S7409-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7409-S7411]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          CHILD MARRIAGE PREVENTION AND PROTECTION ACT OF 2006\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to announce that tomorrow I \nwill introduce the Child Marriage Protection Act of 2006 which is \ncosponsored by Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska. I have believed for a \nlong period of time that one of the best predictors of how a nation \nwill develop economically can be found in the answer to one question: \nHow does that nation treat its women? If women are treated as property \nor slaves without rights or opportunities, the country's prospect for \neconomic advancement will be low. But if women have the opportunity to \nadvance and prosper, so will their nation.\n  The untapped economic and educational potential of girls and women in \nmany developing nations represents an enormous loss to those societies. \nIf women play such a key role in economic development, then we have to \nstart with an even more basic question: How does a country treat its \ndaughters? Girls' educational opportunities and access to health care \nare key variables in this equation.\n  The issue of child marriage is another important, but often \nunrecognized, element that significantly affects access to education \nand dramatically shapes the lives of girls and women in many developing \ncountries. That is why Senator Hagel and I will be introducing this \nbill.\n  Child marriage is dangerous to the health of girls and young women \nand their children, detrimental to economic progress, illegal in most \ncountries, and yet common in many parts of the world. In some \ncountries, girls as young as 7 or 8 years old are often married.\n  This last week's New York Times Sunday magazine had a pictorial \ndisplay of some of these child marriages around the world. It was \nheartbreaking to see girls who would be in the second and third grade \nin the United States of America being claimed as wives by these older \nmen.\n  Early marriage also carries with it serious health risks. In \ndeveloping countries, girls aged 10 to 14 who become pregnant are five \ntimes more likely to die in pregnancy or childbirth than women who are \n20 years to 24 years of age. Their children suffer from high mortality \nrates as well.\n  In countries with high rates of HIV/AIDS, child marriage is itself a \nrisk\n\n[[Page S7410]]\n\nfactor: Girls who are married are at a greater risk of HIV/AIDS than \nunmarried girls. This is one of the many sad ironies of this practice. \nParents may believe that earlier marriage will protect their daughters; \ninstead, it places them in greater danger.\n  Adolescent mothers in developing countries are also at high risk for \na condition known as obstetric fistula. This is a medical condition \nwhich has virtually disappeared in developed countries around the \nworld. It occurs most often when a woman is trapped in prolonged, \nobstructed labor without medical care. In nearly every case, the baby \nin such circumstances is stillborn. Women and girls who survive the \nordeal of prolonged labor may be virtually ripped apart physically in \nthe process.\n  A fistula is an open hole that is created during labor that does not \nheal. This condition may leave its sufferers unable to control their \nbowels or bladder. It can be as debilitating socially as it is \nphysically. These girls and women are often abandoned by the husbands \nwho married them at such an early age and impregnated them, and they \nare shunned by their communities and their families because of this \nterrible physical condition.\n  Last December, I went to the Democratic Republic of Congo with \nSenator Sam Brownback of Kansas. We went to the town of Goma, and in \nthis town of Goma, we visited a hospital known as the Docs Hospital.\n  The Docs Hospital is kept open by the charity and giving of many \nchurches around the world and in the United States. They have a \nsurgical room which is one of the most professional you can imagine in \nthat part of Africa, funded by the United Nations. Almost all of their \nwork is on this condition of obstetric fistula. Young girls pregnant \ntoo soon, subjected to prolonged labor as a result, have this condition \nwhich haunts them. Girls who are the victims of sexual assault face the \nsame possibility. Then, after they have been shunned by the families \nand their tribes, they sometimes walk for hundreds of miles to get to \nthis tiny hospital in Goma.\n  As Senator Brownback and I approached this hospital, we saw these \nwomen lined up sitting in the dirt. They stood as soon as they saw our \nWhite faces and broke into songs of greeting, as one often finds in \nAfrica. We looked at the long line of women waiting for their chance \nfor surgery. When we talked to the surgeon, he said some of them will \nwait for months, and if they are lucky enough to have the surgery, they \nconvalesce two to a bed in this crowded hospital ward. But the surgeon \nwent on to tell us that even one surgery is not enough for many of \nthese women. There are some women who have waited years, with repeated \nsurgeries to try to correct this problem, a problem that would have \nbeen avoided for many of these women had they not been exploited at an \nearly age and if they had not experienced pregnancies which they were \nnot physically prepared to deal with or devastating sexual assaults.\n  We need to do more to help women and girls who are suffering from \nthis condition, but we also need to do everything we can to prevent \nit--through access to family planning and medical care and encouraging \ncommunities to recognize the true social costs of child marriage. That \nis one of the goals of our legislation.\n  We are not trying to dictate to other countries what their laws will \nbe. Child marriage, as I said earlier, is already illegal in most \nnations, and we are not trying to force our will on unwilling \ncountries. But we are trying to promote change through community-based \norganizations that help local leaders and parents recognize the costs \nand horrors of child marriage.\n\n  In addition to the often devastating health consequences of early \nmarriage, girls who are married are often denied opportunities to go to \nschool. Girls' education is increasingly recognized as the critical \nelement in economic growth and development. That is why it has been \nadded as one of the criteria for countries to qualify for assistance \nthrough the multibillion-dollar program, the Millennium Challenge \nAccount.\n  U.N. Secretary Kofi Annan has said that ``educating girls is not an \noption, it is a necessity.'' He is right. Girls' education is a \nrecognized cornerstone of development, but 60 million girls in the \nworld are denied access even to the most basic education. Others may \nstart school but are far less likely to complete school than their \nbrothers because of economic realities and the possibility of child \nmarriage. Early marriage, as I said, is one of the reasons. Engagements \nand weddings frequently signal the end of school for the 10- or 11-\nyear-old bride.\n  Lack of education has an enormous impact on the health, economic \nopportunity, and security of a nation. In Sub-Saharan Africa, children \nwhose mothers have 7 years of education are twice as likely to see \ntheir fifth birthday as children of uneducated mothers. The children of \nmothers who attended school are also far more likely to attend school \nthemselves. Just as early marriage helps to sustain cycles of poverty, \neducation can break those cycles.\n  Our foreign assistance programs need to address the ways in which \nthese issues are linked. The Child Marriage Prevention and Protection \nAct will, No. 1, require the State Department and USAID to create a \ncomprehensive strategy to address child marriage as part of the U.S. \ndevelopment agenda; No. 2, require incorporation of this important \nissue within the annual State Department Country Reports on Human \nRights Practices; No. 3, help countries enforce their existing child \nmarriage laws; and No. 4, authorize $60 million over 3 years, starting \nwith $15 million in the first year, as part of an integrated community-\nbased approach to promote and support girls' education, health care, \nand opportunities.\n  Child marriage is part of a complex matrix of issues and attitudes. \nLast Sunday's New York Times, as I mentioned, described the situation \nin Afghanistan, and here is what they wrote:\n\n       Rather than a willing union between a man and a woman, \n     marriage is frequently a transaction among families, and the \n     younger the bride, the higher the price she may fetch.\n\n  The Times article stated:\n\n       Afghanistan is not alone in this predilection toward early \n     wedlock. Globally, the number of child brides is hard to \n     tabulate; they live mostly in places where births, deaths and \n     human milestones go unrecorded. But there are estimates. \n     About 1 in 7 girls in the developing world (excluding China) \n     gets married before her 15th birthday--\n\n  One in seven--\n\n     according to analyses done by the Population Council, an \n     international research group . . . Tens of millions of girls \n     are having babies before their bodies are mature enough, \n     increasing the likelihood of death from hemorrhaging, \n     obstructed labor and other complications.\n\n  This article described one such wedding: a 13-year-old whose marriage \nwas arranged to pay off a gambling debt.\n  The story also described the engagement of an 11-year-old girl to a \n40-year-old man. They showed the photo. It was horrifying to think \nabout that little girl, who was quoted in the story as saying she \nreally didn't know this man. The girl in question said she had hoped to \nbecome a teacher. Instead, she will become an 11-year-old bride--one \nmore girl in a faraway place in the world who has lost her chance for \nthe future.\n  Child marriage is most common in the rural areas in the poorest \ncountries. This practice perpetuates poverty.\n  Charlotte Ponticelli, who was then the senior coordinator for \ninternational women's issues for the State Department, laid out the \ncase clearly. Ms. Ponticelli stated:\n\n       It is unconscionable that in the 21st century girls as \n     young as 7 or 8 can be sold as brides. There is no denying \n     extreme poverty is the driving factor that has enabled the \n     practice to continue, even in countries where it has been \n     outlawed . . . We need to be shining the spotlight on early \n     marriage and its underlying causes . . . We must continue to \n     do everything we can to ensure that girls have every \n     opportunity to become agents of change and to expand the \n     ``realm of what is possible'' for their societies and the \n     world at large.\n\n  The legislation Senator Hagel and I will introduce is designed to \nsupport community-based efforts to support girls' education, discourage \nearly marriage, and assist young girls and women already in marriage.\n  We invite our colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join this \nbipartisan bill. Parents should never feel that marriage of their 11-\nyear-old daughter is the best option for themselves or their children. \nWith a little help from America and other countries around the world, \nperhaps we can make this a better choice for the daughters, the \nfamilies, their nation, and the world.\n\n[[Page S7411]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/12/senate-section/article/S7409-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7409-S7411]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          CHILD MARRIAGE PREVENTION AND PROTECTION ACT OF 2006\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Durgin\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today to pay special tribute to U.S. \nArmy SGT Russell M. Durgin, a courageous young American from Henniker, \nNH, who on June 13, 2006, gave his last full measure in service to our \nNation.\n  Russell, or Russ or Durgs to family and friends, was a 2001 graduate \nof John Stark Regional High School, Weare, NH, where he played \nlacrosse. Friends say his sense of humor, adventurous spirit, love of \nlife, and wide smile made every moment spent with him a good one. \nDaniel Webster, speaking of early American leaders said, ``While others \ndoubted, they were resolved; where others hesitated they pressed \nforward.'' In this spirit, at the age of 17 while still in High School, \nRuss enlisted in the U.S. Army. He completed basic infantry training at \nFt. Benning, GA, in July 2002. Next came a 1-year tour of duty in South \nKorea with the 1st Battalion, 506th Infantry Regiment, followed by \nassignment to the 1st Battalion, 32nd Infantry Regiment, 10th Mountain \nDivision, Fort Drum, NY, and a 1-year tour of duty to Iraq from \nSeptember 2003 to September 2004. Back in the United States during \n2005, he successfully completed the U.S. Army's warrior leadership \ncourse, combat lifesaver course, and sniper school. In March 2006, he \ndeployed with his unit to Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring \nFreedom.\n  Tragically, in June 2006 during combat operations in the mountains of \nKorengel, Afghanistan, this brave soldier died of injuries sustained \nwhen his unit came under small arms fire. Sergeant Durgin's awards and \ndecorations include two Bronze Star Medals, one with the combat \ndistinguishing ``V'' device, two Army Commendation Medals, one with the \ncombat distinguishing ``V'' device, two Army Achievement Medals, the \nPurple Heart Medal, Army Good Conduct Medal, National Defense Service \nMedal, Afghanistan Campaign Medal, Iraq Campaign Medal, Global War on \nTerrorism Service Medal, Korean Defense Service Medal, Noncommissioned \nOfficers Professional Development Ribbon, Army Service Ribbon, Overseas \nService Ribbon 2, Combat Infantryman Badge, and Expert Weapons \nQualification Badge.\n  Patriots from the State of New Hampshire have served our Nation with \nhonor and distinction from Bunker Hill to Kabul--and U.S. Army SGT \nRussell Durgin served in that fine tradition. Friends and family said \nhe loved his work and was fiercely committed to the Army and to the \npeople with whom he served. During these chaotic and violent times, \nRuss dedicated himself to serving his Nation because in his heart, he \nsensed a call to duty.\n  My sympathy, condolences, and prayers go out to Russell's parents, \nJean and Lester, and to his other family members and many friends who \nhave suffered this most grievous loss. The death of Russ, only 23 years \nold, on an Afghan battlefield far from New Hampshire is also a great \nloss for our State, our benevolent Nation, and the world. He will be \nsorely missed by all; however, his family and friends may draw some \ncomfort in knowing that because of his devotion, sense of duty, and \nselfless dedication, the safety and liberty of each and every American \nis more secure. In the words of Daniel Webster--may his remembrance be \nas long lasting as the land he honored. God bless Russell M. Durgin.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/12/senate-section/article/S7411-2", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7411]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO MARY A. RYAN\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, all of us who know Mary Ryan were \nsaddened by her death on April 25. She was a truly outstanding American \ndiplomat and public servant, and shall be greatly missed.\n  Mary Ryan dedicated her life to public service and to helping others. \nShe joined the Foreign Service in 1966 and went on to serve the \nAmerican people as a skilled diplomat for 36 years, including service \nas Ambassador to Swaziland and Assistant Secretary of State for \nConsular Affairs. She retired as one of the few Americans to achieve \nthe rank of Career Ambassador, and one of the very first women to do \nso, a major distinction in her profession, but above all, she touched \nmany lives in the State Department. She served as a mentor to \ngenerations in the Foreign Service, and many considered her to be the \nmatriarch of America's diplomats.\n  As Assistant Secretary of State for Consular Affairs, from 1993 to \nher retirement in 2002, she frequently testified before Congress, and \nprovided us with valuable guidance and impressive expertise. Thanks to \nher leadership, Congress made necessary changes to enable the Bureau of \nConsular Affairs to improve technology, efficiency and information-\nsharing. She worked aggressively to develop the TIPOFF terrorist \nlookout system, which became the basis of our current terrorism data \nsystem. She was recognized as a leader on consular issues around the \nworld.\n  Mary Ryan exemplified the best in public service. In a commencement \naddress she delivered some years ago at her alma mater, Saint John's \nUniversity, she said, ``I ask you what JFK asked the youth of my day to \ndo, to return something to the community which has protected and \neducated you.''\n  She encouraged young men and women to ``reject the murderous din of \nmaterialism,'' emphasizing, ``There is more to life than the amount of \nmoney on your W-2 at the end of the year.''\n  Mary Ryan lived by those words, and they defined her own career and \nlife.\n  In the immediate aftermath of the bombings of the American embassies \nin Kenya and Tanzania in August 1998, Mary put on a hardhat and climbed \nthrough the bombed rubble of the embassy in Nairobi, wanting to know \nthe name and background of each of the victims, both American and \nKenyan alike. She dedicated much of her subsequent work to improving \nthe security of our embassies around the world, and offering a more \ncompassionate outreach to the State Department's most valuable assets, \nits men and women.\n  At a service in honor of one of the Foreign Service Officers who died \nin the Kenya bombing, Mary Ryan spoke these words:\n  ``She was a beautiful, beautiful person. We are greatly diminished by \nher loss.''\n  That was true of Mary as well. She too was a beautiful, beautiful, \nperson, and we will miss her very much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/12/senate-section/article/S7411-3", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7411]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate \ncrimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable \nin our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to \nhighlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  On May 26, 2003, in Lawrence, KY, Josh Graves, a 15-year-old boy who \nsuffers from cerebral palsy, was attacked at a local park by four \nteenage boys. The four boys approached Graves, taunting him and asking \nhim if he was retarded. They attacked Graves, knocking him to the \nground before punching and kicking him. After the attack, Graves was \nleft on the ground suffering multiple seizures. According to reports, \nthe sole motivation for this attack was Grave's disability.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/12/senate-section/article/S7411-4", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7411-S7412]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n          RECOGNITION OF NEW NATIONAL BOARD CERTIFIED TEACHERS\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I congratulate a special group \nof Hawaii teachers, those who have successfully earned the designation \nNational Board Certified Teacher. During 2005, a new cadre of 30 \nconsummate professionals demonstrated that their teaching practice is \nconsistent with the rigorous requirements for the profession as set by \nthe National Board for Professional Teaching Standards. Their \nachievement brings the number of teachers working in Hawaii who have \nattained National Board Certification to 111.\n  These dedicated teachers are distributed throughout Hawaii's \neducation\n\n[[Page S7412]]\n\nsystem. Some teach at the elementary level, some in middle schools, \nwhile others teach in high school classrooms. Some teach on Oahu, some \nare on the Big Island, and others on Kauai and Maui. Some teach \nlanguage arts, math, or social studies, while others teach a variety of \nother disciplines. Some teach special needs students, a number are \ngeneralists, others are specialists, and a few are librarians. \nNevertheless, all of them have one thing in common, their dedication to \nenabling the schoolchildren of Hawaii to achieve all that they can. I \nam proud to enter their names into the Record of this august body.\n  During the 2005 school year the following teachers received National \nBoard Certification: Leslie Agena, Kailua High School; Amy Boehning, \nWaialua High and Intermediate School; Genevieve ``Noe'' Bunnell, Pearl \nRidge Elementary School; Lisa Chang, Niu Valley Middle School; Susan \nErikson, Washington Middle School; Marta Finley, Kealakehe Elementary \nSchool; Cathy Lynne K.L. Fong, Liholiho Elementary School; Candace \nFoster, Aina Haina Elementary School; Kimberly Fradale, Mid-Pacific \nInstitute; Raejean Gamiao, Mililani Uka Elementary School; Douglas \nGarriss, Kamiloiki Elementary School; Lisa Hockenberger, Kalihi-Kai \nElementary School; Janet Itano, Aina Haina Elementary School; Inga \nKelly, Moanalua High School; Cristy Kessler, Education Lab School; Jill \nLaboy, Kailua High School; Sallie Lee, Lanakila Elementary School; \nDavid Mecham, Waimea High School; Melinda O'Herron, Konawaena Middle \nSchool; Carolyn Okunaga, Mililani High School; Dianne Pang, Aliiolani \nElementary School; Margaret Prevenas, Kalama Intermediate School; Helie \nRock, Keaau High School; Julie Shirai, Pearl Ridge Elementary School; \nAmber Strong, Kailua High School; Marla Thompson, Waianae High School; \nPatricia Uehara, Kealakehe Elementary School; Mark Watanabe, Keaau High \nSchool; Jennifer Williams, Roosevelt High School; and Ms Zami-Perez, \nWaialua Elementary School.\n  I offer my heartfelt congratulations to them all. They have worked \nvery hard to earn the designation, National Board Certified Teacher.\n  The National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, the \norganization that confers this designation, is a teacher-led \nassociation, which grants national certification to a teacher only \nafter a very rigorous and comprehensive process. It requires the \npreparation of a portfolio featuring actual videotaped classroom \nlessons, including a written analysis of the lesson, lesson plans and \nstudent work samples. The teacher must also submit written discussion, \nanalysis, and reflective commentaries concerning curriculum and \npractices used in the classroom. A third component of the portfolio \nincludes records of activities benefiting the larger school community, \nincluding families and activities that help to improve the teaching \nprofession. Also required for this certification is successful \ncompletion of a rigorous set of examinations assessing the content \nknowledge of the teacher. This is a very arduous process requiring a \ncommitment of up to 400 hours. However, in Hawaii help is available. \nThe Hawaii Teacher Standards Board, along with the Hawaii State \nTeachers Association, provides support groups for teachers undertaking \nthis process. These sessions are held on the islands of Oahu, Maui, \nKauai and the Big Island, and they provide a support network for \ncandidates as they go through the certification process. Most often \nsupport is offered through a qualified facilitator, a teacher who has \nalready earned the designation of National Board Certified Teacher. \nThese support networks are also places to meet with and support other \nteachers undergoing the same process. This assistance goes a long way \nin making this very difficult process possible.\n  National Board Certification does not replace the teacher licensure \nrequirements as maintained by the Hawaii Teacher Standards Board, but \ninstead identifies the recipient as an exemplary practitioner, someone \nat the top of his or her profession. It signifies the teacher as \nsomeone who is a recognized leader in the art and science of teaching. \nResearch has shown time and again that students in classrooms with \nNational Board Certified Teachers do better on assessments than do \nstudents in classrooms not staffed with nationally certified teachers. \nIt is the only nationally based teacher evaluation and certification \nprogram to successfully undergo a scientifically based set of \nevaluations and to have shown improved results for students. I am very \nproud to honor these newly recognized teachers.\n  At a time when the country is working to improve education, when the \nNo Child Left Behind Act is demanding a highly qualified teacher in \nevery classroom, where schools, districts and states are required to \nmake adequate yearly progress, where students are increasingly required \nto demonstrate achievement as measured by high stakes testing in order \nto graduate from high school, where districts and states are working to \nfind, hire and retain professionals in this very difficult field, and \nwhere research has shown the knowledge and ability of the classroom \nteacher is the most important factor affecting the learning of the \nstudents, I am proud to say to these newly certified teachers ``Well \nDone'' and ``Mahalo Nui Loa.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/12/senate-section/article/S7412-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7412]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECOGNIZING COMMANDER ROBERT H.

In 1974, Packard graduated with a bachelors of science degree \nfrom the McIntire School of Commerce at the University of Virginia \nwhile serving in the Naval Reserve. After serving various tours, \nPackard became commanding officer of the Mobile Mine Assembly Group \nfrom 1988 to 1992 in Yorktown, VA, where his unit received the REDCOM \nSIX award for the Best Small Unit, the Most Improved Unit and the Best \nSmall Unit with over 50 percent enlisted. He served in Desert Storm \nfrom 1992 to 1994 and then from 1994 to 1997 Packard served as \ncommanding officer of a medical logistics unit in Newport News, VA. \nPackard concluded his service with the Navy at the Pentagon as a \ncommander assigned to the OPNAV N86 staff.\n  Commander Packard's leadership and dedication to preserving the \nfreedoms and liberties that make this country so great is truly \nadmirable. I am grateful for Commander Packard's service and \ncontributions to the United States and to the Commonwealth of \nVirginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/12/senate-section/article/S7412-2", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7412]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           CONGRATULATING CHAMPIONS FOR HEALTHY KIDS WINNERS\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

Mr. President, I ask the Senate to join me today \nin honoring the 50 years of public contribution by an innovative \ntechnology company started in Rochester, MN, in 1956. International \nBusiness Machines, more commonly known internationally as IBM, has made \neconomic growth possible in a competitive and continually changing \nmarketplace.\n  In 1956, when IBM President Thomas Watson, Jr., met with 40 Rochester \nbusiness and civic leaders at the Kahler Hotel to establish a new IBM \nfacility, they probably never envisioned that\n\n[[Page S7413]]\n\nRochester would become home to the world's fastest computer named \n``Blue Gene'' that would be able to perform 18.2 trillion operations \nper second. They probably could not have dreamed that 50 years later \nIBM would become Minnesota's largest information firm, with 5,600 \nemployees in the Rochester and Twin Cities areas. And they probably \ncould not have imagined that the plant they were planning would account \nfor 15 percent of Minnesota's high-tech manufactured exports, in a \nState that continues to lead the field in technology.\n  IBM has spent 50 years growing into a world wide corporation which \ncontributes to our economy at an astounding level. In 2005, IBM earned \nmore U.S. patents than any other company for the 13th consecutive year, \nwith 2,941 in 2005. IBM ensures that our Nation stays competitive in \nthe global economy. Rochester has helped lead that wave of innovation.\n  IBM and its employees and retirees have also been generous supporters \nof education and nonprofit organizations. Through cash and technology \ngrants of $3.4 million and more than 185,000 hours of volunteerism in \n2005 alone, they have been a great benefit to Minnesota's communities \nand schools.\n  With the people of Minnesota, I ask this Chamber to join in \ncelebrating IBM's 50th year of operation in Rochester, MN.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/12/senate-section/article/S7413-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7413]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CONGRATULATIONS TO SISTER CITIES\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to congratulate the cities of Saginaw, MI, and Tokushima, \nJapan, on the 45th anniversary of their sister city partnership. This \nis a significant milestone, and I am delighted to recognize these two \ncities for their many years of dialog and exchange.\n  In 1961, Saginaw and Tokushima established a relationship that sought \nto promote cultural awareness between the cities. Since that time, \nthere has been significant interaction between the two cities, \nincluding student groups and other delegations traveling between the \ncities for cultural, educational and other purposes, as well as the \nexchange of gifts.\n  In 1971, the Tokushima-Saginaw Friendship Garden was built in \nSaginaw, and the land adjacent to the garden was subsequently deeded to \nthe city of Tokushima. In 1985, a tea house was also built in Saginaw. \nContractors and laborers from both cities were instrumental in its \nconstruction of the tea house and the labor costs were equally borne by \nboth Saginaw and Tokushima. Upon its completion, the tea house became \none of only 11 in the United States, and the only authentic tea house \nin the Midwest.\n  Promoting dialog and interaction between cities in the United States \nand other countries is a great way for communities to learn, understand \nand relate to other cultures. Through their Sister City Partnership, \nresidents and officials of the cities of Saginaw and Tokushima now have \na deeper and more personal appreciation for the traditions of both the \nUnited States and Japan. I know my colleagues join me in congratulating \nSaginaw and Tokushima on the 45 years of cultural exchange, and I wish \nthem the best as this relationship continues to develop \nfurther.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/12/senate-section/article/S7413-2", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7413]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/12/senate-section/article/S7413-3", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7413]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/12/senate-section/article/S7413-4", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7413]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 4:14 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill and joint resolution, in which it requests \nthe concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.R. 4411.

A bill to amend the Reclamation Wastewater and Groundwater \nStudy and Facilities Act to provide standards and procedures for the \nreview of water reclamation and reuse projects; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I join my colleague, from the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources, Senator Dianne Feinstein of \nCalifornia, in introducing the Reclaiming the Nation's Water Act--\nReNew.\n  We introduce this bill after months of review of the Nation's \nprogram, now over a decade old, that attempts to encourage the \nreclamation and use of water. The Bureau's title XVI program originated \nin 1992 in response to the Southwestern drought of the late 1980s and \nearly 1990s. At that time, Congress authorized the program in an \nattempt to alleviate pressure on the Colorado River system by \naugmenting existing supplies and developing new water sources.\n  Since then, Congress has authorized some 31 projects and appropriated \nabout $325 million for the program. During a February 28, 2006, hearing \nof the Senate Water and Power Subcommittee, the Congressional Research \nService reported that only three of these projects have received full \nFederal funding and that 9 are listed as ``inactive,'' meaning they \nhave received little or no Federal moneys.\n  This massive backlog, which the Bureau of Reclamation has estimated \nwill take at least 15 years to resolve, has not stopped local \ncommunities from seeking additional aid under the program. There are \nbills pending in Congress that would authorize an additional 19 \nprojects--projects that will likely overwhelm the Bureau of \nReclamation's budget, if they were all to be funded fully under the \nexisting program.\n  In an effort to clarify the Federal role in developing new sources of \nwater and in an effort to help local Government receive a dependable \nand timely supply of Federal assistance for truly worthy water reuse \nprojects, we introduce this legislation to clarify and make permanent \ntitle XVI water reuse/reclamation/recycling grant assistance.\n  Briefly, the bill:\n  Amends the Reclamation and Wastewater and Groundwater Study and \nFacilities Act to provide standards and\n\n[[Page S7418]]\n\nprocedures for the review of water reclamation and reuse projects. \nUnder existing law, the title XVI program has operated without defined \nterms or specific purpose. This has led to confusion in recent years \nwhether the title XVI program is primarily a demonstration program or \nwas intended to finance permanent reclamation and reuse facilities. \nThis legislation clarifies that the purpose of the title XVI program \nwill be: (1) to assist in the development of permanent local and \nregional water reclamation and reuse projects; and (2) to further \nimprove water reclamation and reuse technologies through research and \ndemonstration activities.\n  The legislation also authorizes the Secretary of Interior to \nparticipate in opportunities for water reclamation and reuse, including \nwater recycling and desalination activities in reclamation States. The \nlegislation provides new authority for the Secretary of the Interior to \nreview non-Federal water reclamation and reuse project proposals, \npursuant to new standards and procedures for such review. New standards \nwould include providing sufficient evidence to the Secretary of \nInterior that the project: (1) is technically viable and (2) has a \nfinancially capable project sponsor. The Secretary would have 180 days \nto submit to Congress: (1) a statement and explanation of the project's \ntechnical and financial viability, and (2) a recommendation on whether \nthe project should be authorized for construction based on several \nspecific factors. Factors to be considered would range from items \nrelated to project costs and benefits, to whether the project would \nhelp serve an identified Federal interest. The bill also includes \ntransition procedures.\n  The bill as currently proposed also: (1) Strikes existing provisions \nproviding for appraisal investigations and replaces them in part with a \nnew planning and assistance program--$4.4 million authorized annually--\nfor non-Federal project sponsors electing to seek help in developing \nproject proposals.\n  (2) Strikes existing provisions providing for feasibility \ninvestigations and replaces them with a new technical and financial \nreview process for evaluating non-Federal sponsor project proposals. \nDeadlines are included for the technical and financial viability \nreviews, and a process is established for reporting and making \nrecommendations to Congress on project proposals for funding.\n  (3) Clarifies that projects must be authorized for construction by \nthe Congress before funds may be expended by the Secretary of the \nInterior for project construction.\n  (4) Limits the Federal cost-share for projects to the lesser of 20 \npercent or $20 million of total project costs--the current limit is 25 \npercent or $20 million--excluding operations and maintenance costs.\n  (5) And makes numerous technical and conforming amendments.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to working with my colleagues, Members \nof the House, and the administration to perfect and move this bill \nthrough the process this year. I believe this bill will provide \nvaluable assistance to local areas to increase the available supplies \nof potable water through the economic reuse and reclamation of water \nsupplies, while providing an affordable and orderly process that will \nprove fairer to local communities and help them to receive federal \nassistance in a timely manner.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the legislation be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3639\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

I rise today to join my distinguished \ncolleague, Senator Murkowski, chair of the Subcommittee on Water and \nPower, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, in introducing \nlegislation to provide new authority and streamlined review criteria \nfor the Bureau of Reclamation's title XVI Water Recycling Program.\n  I first want to thank Senator Murkowski for her leadership in this \narea. I deeply appreciate her willingness to work with me on this \nissue.\n  I also want to thank my California colleague and friend, \nRepresentative Grace Napolitano, ranking member on the Water and Power \nSubcommittee, who is introducing identical companion legislation in the \nHouse of Representatives today.\n  This legislation is an outgrowth of subcommittee oversight hearings \nlast February and is the product of more than 2 years of discussion, \nevaluation, and consultation with the Bureau of Reclamation as well as \nnumerous water agencies and communities.\n  Today, the West faces two daunting challenges simultaneously. The \nfirst is drought and the impacts of continued climate gyration--wild \nswings in previously established weather patterns. The second is the \nunprecedented growth throughout California and the Western States. \nPopulation continues to not just grow but surge throughout this region.\n  The title XVI, Water Recycling Program enables water users in the \nWest to stretch existing supplies through the application of \nreclamation, reuse, recycling and desalination technologies.\n  Title XVI was initially authorized in 1992, following a severe \nmultiyear drought in California and other Western States. A drought of \nequal severity reduced the mighty Colorado River to record lows only a \nfew years ago. We must find ways to expand our water supplies, and do \nso without generating regional or environmental conflict. Reusing our \nexisting supplies and stretching those supplies is a significant part \nof the solution. The title XVI program provides the authority and \nframework to accomplish these water resource development objectives to \nmeet the needs of our cities and urban areas, our farms and ranches and \nour diverse environment.\n  This legislation clarifies and makes permanent the U.S. Department of \nthe Interior and Bureau of Reclamation's title XVI water reuse/\nreclamation/recycling grant authority for the development of new \nsources of water. In so doing, this proposed legislation will help \nState and local governments and water departments and agencies develop \nnew water and reliable water supplies.\n  The bill amends the Reclamation and Wastewater and Groundwater Study \nand Facilities Act, 1992, to provide new standards and procedures for \nthe review of water reclamation and reuse projects by the Interior \nDepartment's Bureau of Reclamation. Additionally, the legislation sets \nforth specific criteria to assist Congress in the evaluation and \nselection of projects for Federal funding.\n  In the recent past, the Bureau of Reclamation was not able to review \nand report on proposed projects in a timely fashion. This legislation \nestablishes firm deadlines, a clear process, and very specific criteria \nby which project reviews are to be conducted.\n  This program, unlike traditional Bureau of Reclamation project \nfunding, provides a grant, not to exceed 20 percent of the capital \ncosts or $20 million making this the most leveraged and most cost-\nshared Federal water resources program. In setting the 20 percent cap, \nthis legislation reduces the overall percentage Federal participation \nto 20 percent from the 1992 standard of 25 percent to enable more \nprojects to receive Federal cost-share support.\n  Reclaiming the Nation's Water Act is designed to accomplish one major \nobjective--development of new water supplies responsibly--and in a \ntimely manner. From a California perspective, this legislation \ncompliments and is fully consistent with the recently published \nCalifornia Water Plan Update 2005--published in 2006--by California \nDepartment of Water Resources and the 2002 State of California's Water \nRecycling Task Force, Water Recycling 2030. Both reports conclude that \na significant portion of new water to be developed in California will \ncome from water recycling.\n  Throughout the Nation's more than 200-year history, water conflicts \nin the West have ``erupted'' periodically. This program is designed to \nreduce conflict through sound planning, improved management, expanding \nexisting supplies, leveraged financing and meaningful partnerships.\n  The Subcommittee on Water and Power will hold a hearing on this \nproposed legislation later this month. At that time, the subcommittee \nwill also hear testimony on three proposed projects, one each in \nRiverside, Orange and San Bernardino Counties. I have carefully \nreviewed these projects. They are designed to produce approximately \n300,000 acre-feet of new water annually. These projects simultaneously \nreduce pressure on the Bay Delta--and other Federal and State water \nusers dependent on the water from the delta--as well as the Colorado \nRiver. They will help drought-proof their water service areas.\n  Not too long ago, in a speech delivered at a WateReuse Association \nconference, John Keys, the recently retired Commissioner, Bureau of \nReclamation, called recycled water The Last River to Tap. Commissioner \nKeys was right.\n  I would like to provide some additional detail on the legislation. \nThe legislation provides new authority for the Secretary of the \nInterior to review non-Federal water reclamation and reuse project \nproposals, pursuant to new standards and procedures for such review.\n  New standards would include providing sufficient evidence to the \nSecretary of Interior that the project: (1) is technically viable and \n(2) has a financially capable project sponsor. The Secretary would have \n180 days to submit to Congress: (1) a statement and explanation of the \nproject's technical and financial viability, and (2) a recommendation \non whether the project should be authorized for construction based on \nseveral specific factors. Factors to be considered would range from \nitems related to project costs and benefits, to whether the project \nwould help serve an identified Federal interest. The bill also includes \ntransition procedures.\n  This program is vital to the West's future. I look forward to working \nwith Senator Murkowski and my colleagues on the Energy Committee. I \nwant to also thank Energy Committee Chairman Pete Domenici and the \ncommittee's ranking member, Senator Jeff Bingaman for their support and \nassistance in the preparation of this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 3646. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to create \na bureau of Reclamation partnership with the North Bay Water Reuse \nAuthority and other regional partners to achieve objectives relating to \nwater supply, water quality, and environmental restoration; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the North \nBay Water Reuse Program Act of 2006. The act would authorize an \ninnovative program to protect the environment while meeting the future \nwater needs of urban and agricultural water users in the North Bay \nregion of California for years to come.\n  As regulations continue to tighten restrictions on wastewater \ndischarges into the San Francisco Bay, communities are faced with major \nfinancial challenges as they determine the best way to discharge their \ntreated wastewater. At the same time, agricultural producers in the \nNorth Bay region are facing serious water shortages resulting from a \nserious overdraft of groundwater. The North Bay Water Reuse Program \nwill solve both problems together.\n  When completed, the North Bay Water Reuse Program will provide for\n\n[[Page S7421]]\n\nthe collection and conveyance of treated urban wastewater to \nagricultural growers, promising a permanent and dedicated supply of \nabout 30,000 acre-feet of water per year. The use of reclaimed water \nfor irrigation will reduce the demand on both surface and groundwater \nsupplies, and thus improve instream flows for riparian habitat and \nfisheries recovery.\n  In the off-season when irrigation demand is diminished, the reclaimed \nwater will be used to increase surface water flows for restoration of \nwetland habitat in the former Cargill Salt Ponds.\n  This reclaimed water that would be applied productively to vineyards, \nfields and wetlands is now being discharged as treated wastewater into \nthe San Francisco Bay-Delta Estuary. The North Bay Water Reuse Program \nwill benefit the ecosystem of the bay by providing a cost-effective, \nenvironmentally sound alternative for the disposal of urban wastewater.\n  The legislation I am introducing today allows for the Federal \nparticipation of the first phase of this long-term regional project. \nThis cost-shared water reclamation and reuse program is the first of \nits kind in Northern California, and the first to provide water \nprimarily for agricultural and environmental uses. It is supported by \nthe local governments in three counties--Napa, Sonoma and Marin--that \nhave joined together to undertake the project. Agricultural \norganizations, such as the Napa and Sonoma County Farm Bureaus, the \nCarneros Quality Alliance, the Winegrape Growers of Napa County, the \nNapa Vintners Association, and the North Bay Agriculture Alliance, \nsupport the program. And environmental organizations, such as The Bay \nInstitute, likewise endorse the program.\n  The North Bay Water Reuse Program brings together stakeholders that \nare usually at odds with one another and provides an ideal solution to \nguarantee water to the environment and agricultural producers, and \nsimultaneously providing regulatory relief to wastewater agencies.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3646\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nwaive the monthly beneficiary premium under a prescription drug plan or \nan MA-PD plan during months in which an individual enrolled in such a \nplan has a gap in prescription drug coverage; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, nearly one-third of Medicare beneficiaries \nare going to become all too familiar with what is called the ``doughnut \nhole'' over the next several months. The doughnut hole is a gap in \ncoverage that exists in most Medicare prescription drug plans.\n  Here is how the doughnut hole works: Under most plans, Medicare will \npay for 75 percent of drug costs up to $2,250 after an initial $250 \ndeductible. But then Medicare pays nothing until drug expenses exceed \n$5,100. During this gap in coverage, beneficiaries continue to pay \nmonthly premiums but get no drug coverage at all. I think this is \nunfair.\n  That is why I am introducing the Prescription for Fairness Act. This \nlegislation is simple. It says seniors should not have to pay monthly \npremiums during the time when they have\n\n[[Page S7422]]\n\nno drug coverage. The legislation would waive the monthly premium for \nany month that a senior is trapped in the doughnut hole.\n  The legislation will help people like Mrs. McLain, an 88-year-old \nwoman who lives in a long-term care facility in Bottineau, ND. She \nenrolled in the Medicare prescription drug benefit earlier this year. \nHer brother, who helps pay her health care bills, was recently \ncontacted by their local pharmacist. The pharmacist explained that Mrs. \nMcLain no longer has Medicare drug coverage and must pay about $500 \nevery month for her diabetes medications. This is not an expense that \nthey had planned for, nor one they can afford. They did not realize \nthat this coverage gap existed when they enrolled in the plan. This is \none of countless stories that we will hear over the next several months \nas seniors fall into this coverage gap.\n  Some will say that beneficiaries trapped in the doughnut hole should \nhave selected plans that provide better coverage. I think it is unfair \nto blame beneficiaries for selecting the wrong plan. A new report by \nthe Government Accountability Office found that the call centers \noperated by the Medicare prescription drug plan sponsors only gave \naccurate and complete information to callers about one-third of the \ntime. More than one in five callers received completely inaccurate \ninformation.\n  It is worth noting that the Prescription for Fairness Act will have \nno affect on the bottom lines of the participating Medicare \nprescription drug plans. Under the legislation, the Secretary of the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services will simply pay the monthly \npremium on behalf of the beneficiary. It is offset by reducing the \nMedicare stabilization fund. This fund is completely unnecessary. It is \na $10 billion pot of money that was added to the Medicare Modernization \nAct to provide bonus payments and incentives to managed care companies \nto enter the Medicare market. It is time that Congress provides a \nsafety net for seniors, not health plans.\n  This legislation merely provides seniors some relief in the short \nterm. The legislation would expire after fiscal year 2008. This \nCongress still needs to close the doughnut hole. In October, I joined \nSenator Bill Nelson to introduce the Medicare Prescription Drug Gap \nReduction Act, which would allow the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices to negotiate fair drug prices and the savings would be used to \neliminate the doughnut hole. Believe it or not, the Medicare \nModernization Act contained a provision that explicitly prohibits the \ngovernment from using its market clout to negotiate for fair drug \nprices for our seniors.\n  I am hopeful that the Senate will take up the Medicare Prescription \nDrug Gap Reduction Act. In the meantime, let's make sure seniors are \nnot charged for a benefit that they are not receiving. The Prescription \nfor Fairness Act does just that.\n  I am pleased to be joined by Senators Bingaman, Stabenow, Lautenberg, \nJohnson, Mikulski, Clinton, Menendez and Akaka in introducing this \nimportant legislation. I am also pleased that Families USA has endorsed \nthis legislation.\n  I ask for unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3647\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to compromise and settle all claims in the case of \nPueblo of Isleta v. United States, to restore, improve, and develop the \nvaluable on-reservation land and natural resources of the Pueblo, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today with my good friend and \ncolleague, Senator Bingaman, to introduce the Pueblo of Isleta \nSettlement and Natural Resources Restoration Act of 2006, an important \npiece of legislation for some of our constituents, the people of the \nPueblo of Isleta.\n  The Pueblo filed suit against the United States under Public Law 104-\n198, which conferred jurisdiction on the U.S. Court of Federal Claims \nwith respect to land claims of the Pueblo of Isleta Indian Tribe, \nalleging loss and injury to the Pueblo's lands and property interests \nbecause of mismanagement by the Federal Government. The parties to the \nsuit have spent several years reviewing and discussing these \nallegations, and this year the Pueblo of Isleta, the U.S. Department of \nJustice, and the U.S. Department of Interior have come to an agreement \non how to resolve those claims. The legislation I am introducing today \nwith Senator Bingaman will codify the parties' agreement.\n  Under the terms of the settlement agreement, the parties have agreed \non how to use the funds paid to the Pueblo of Isleta. Some of the funds \nwill be used for drainage and remediation of the Pueblo's agricultural \nlands that have been waterlogged. Some of the funds will be spent to \nrehabilitate and remediate the Pueblo's forest lands. Other funds will \nbe used for the acquisition, restoration, improvement, development, and \nprotection of land, natural resources and cultural resources of the \nPueblo and for the payment and reimbursement of expenses incurred in \nconnection with this lawsuit.\n  The Pueblo of Isleta, the Department of Interior, and the Department \nof Justice have worked long and hard to resolve this matter. I believe \nCongress should act expeditiously to ratify the agreement they have \nreached.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord\n\n[[Page S7423]]\n\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3648\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I'm pleased today to join my colleague \nSenator Domenici in sponsoring the Pueblo of Isleta Settlement and \nNatural Resources Restoration Act. This bill would settle a \nlongstanding dispute over federal mismanagement of lands that resulted \nin lands within the Pueblo being rendered unusable due to water \nintrusion. The money provided under the settlement would be designated \ntowards remedying these losses.\n  Like any settlement, I imagine neither side is completely happy with \nthe result but it is a significant step and will begin the process of \nrestoring inundated lands and acquiring substitute lands. I am happy \nboth sides were able to work out their differences and come up with a \nsolution we can support in Congress. I hope that, in addition to the \nfinancial commitment in the bill, the Department of Interior will \ncontinue to be a partner with the Pueblo in achieving the restoration \nof their lands.\n  I hope my colleagues will join us to quickly move this legislation \nalong so we can begin to restore these lands for the people of the \nPueblo of Isleta.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Menendez, Mr. \n        Dorgan, Mr. Kennedy, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Dayton, Mr. Johnson, \n        Mrs. Clinton, and Mr. Akaka):\n  S. 3650. A bill to include costs incurred by the Indian Health \nService, a Federally qualified health center, an AIDS drug assistance \nprogram, certain hospitals, or a pharmaceutical manufacturer patient \nassistance program in providing prescription drugs toward the annual \nout of pocket threshold under part D of title XVIII of the Social \nSecurity Act and to provide a safe harbor for assistance provided under \na pharmaceutical manufacturer patient assistance program; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nwith Senators Lautenberg, Menendez, Dorgan, Kennedy, Stabenow, Dayton, \nJohnson, Clinton, and Akaka entitled the ``Helping to Fill the Medicare \nRx Gap Act of 2006.'' This legislation and companion legislation to be \nintroduced by Congressman Dingell fixes an important problem for \nMedicare beneficiaries and safety net providers by allowing costs \nincurred by AIDS Drug Assistance Programs, ADAPs, the Indian Health \nService, IHS, federally qualified health centers, certain safety net \nhospitals, and pharmaceutical manufacturer-sponsored Patient Assistance \nPrograms, PAPs--entities that provide prescription drugs or drug \nassistance for populations under their care--to count toward a \nbeneficiary's annual out-of-pocket threshold as established under the \nMedicare Modernization Act, MMA.\n  With the Medicare drug benefit now in effect for more than six \nmonths, approximately 3.4 million seniors are reaching the point at \nwhich coverage is eliminated until they reach the catastrophic limit. \nUnder the MMA, Medicare pays 75 percent of drug costs until a \nbeneficiary's expenses reach $2,250 in a year. Then it stops paying \nuntil costs exceed $5,100, leaving a so-called ``doughnut hole'' of \n$2,850 that seniors are expected to manage on their own. According to \nthe Kaiser Family Foundation, about 6.9 million Medicare beneficiaries \nwill have to deal with a gap in their drug coverage at some point this \nyear.\n  An important part of the MMA's prescription drug benefit requires the \ntracking of beneficiaries' ``true out-of-pocket'' costs, TrOOP, to \ndetermine the point at which a beneficiary becomes eligible for \ncatastrophic coverage. In an additional effort to constrain the cost of \nthe prescription drug benefit, the MMA limited the types of \nexpenditures that could count toward a beneficiary's TrOOP, including \nonly:\n  Cost-sharing related to the annual deductible; costs borne by the \nPart D enrollee (or contributions by friends or family members on the \nbeneficiary's behalf); contributions from qualifying State Pharmacy \nAssistance Programs, SPAPs; contributions from eligible charitable \norganizations; and waivers or reductions by commercial pharmacies of \ncost-sharing requirements of Medicare prescription drug plans.\n  Under current law, costs incurred by AIDS Drug Assistance Programs, \nIndian Health Service, IHS, pharmacies, community health centers, and \ncertain safety net hospital pharmacies on behalf of Part D enrollees \nduring their coverage gap--i.e. while the enrollee is in the so-called \n``doughnut hole''--are not permitted to count for TrOOP purposes. In \nturn, many individuals with HIV/AIDS, Native Americans, and other low-\nincome individuals receiving assistance through community health \ncenters or other qualified safety net hospital pharmacies are never \nable to reach the catastrophic limit--the point at which Medicare would \npay 95 percent of the beneficiary's drug costs. As a result, these \nbeneficiaries are forced to pay premiums to their Medicare drug plan \nand to absorb the monthly drug costs for a benefit they are not able to \naccess.\n  A study that was recently published in the New England Journal of \nMedicine found that prescription drug plans that include doughnut hole-\nlike coverage gaps may lower beneficiary drug costs but any savings are \noffset by increases in the costs of hospitalizations and emergency room \nuse. Specifically, the study found that patients with such capped \nbenefits had higher rates of nonelective hospitalizations, visits to \nthe emergency department, and even death. It certainly is not \nsurprising that the coverage gap will result in many Americans going \nwithout needed medications but it is important to note that overall \nmedical costs are not reduced and that providers will be \ndisproportionately affected when the doughnut hole is reached.\n  And just when charity pharmaceutical assistance programs are needed \nmost, the current policy is making it difficult for pharmaceutical \ncompanies to continue to provide free pharmaceuticals to our nation's \npoor elderly. The HHS OIG has issued guidance that prohibits costs \nincurred on behalf of Part D beneficiaries by pharmaceutical \nmanufacturer-sponsored Pharmaceutical Assistance Programs, PAPs--\nprograms run by the pharmaceutical industry that provide free or low-\ncost drugs to eligible poor and low-income individuals to count toward \na patient's TrOOP due to concerns that providing drugs through these \nprograms might violate the federal anti-kickback statute. The anti-\nkickback statute prohibits offering or receiving payment to increase \nthe use of products or services--in this case, to steer prescription \ndrug use--at the cost of Federal health care programs. In turn, several \npharmaceutical manufacturers are considering terminating their PAPs to \navoid running afoul of the law. According to a January article in the \nWashington Post, 37 pharmaceutical companies donated 22 million \nprescriptions worth $4.1 billion through PAPs. Across the Nation \nseniors who benefit from these programs are fearful that they will be \nforced to go off needed medications or to go into bankruptcy if these \nprograms are not available to help them.\n\n[[Page S7425]]\n\n  While HHS is working with the pharmaceutical industry to develop \nguidelines that would allow PAPs to continue to operate in compliance \nwith current law, the HHS OIG maintains that PAP costs will not be \npermitted to count toward a patient's TrOOP in any circumstance. As a \nresult, similar to the ADAPs, IHS pharmacies, community health centers \nand safety net hospital pharmacies, PAPs that provide prescription \ndrugs for patients during the coverage gap are forced to become the \n``payer of last resort'' because the costs they incur are not permitted \nto count toward TrOOP expenses and thus, the patient is unable to reach \nthe catastrophic limit.\n  Pharmacy Assistance Programs, AIDS Drug Assistance Programs, \ncommunity health centers, and safety net hospital pharmacies will \nmaintain their commitment to provide assistance to low-income senior \ncitizens and people with disabilities in the coverage gap but the \ncurrent policy imposes a significant financial burden on our nation's \nhealth care safety net. While we all recognize the importance of \ncontrolling costs, this policy stands to harm vulnerable beneficiaries \nand safety net providers by permitting the Medicare program to shift \nthe cost burden on to a variety of other federal programs, including \ndiscretionary safety net programs, and PAPs. It does not make sense \nthat the Federal Government pays private drug plans a capitated rate to \nprovide services and beneficiaries pay monthly premiums to Medicare \nwhile ADAPs, IHS pharmacies, community health centers and certain \nsafety net hospital pharmacies and pharmaceutical manufacturer PAPs are \nleft to shoulder the cost of providing prescription medications to \ntheir population of enrollees who will never reach the catastrophic \nlimit. Just as current policy allows SPAP spending to count toward the \ncatastrophic limit so should the costs incurred by these entities.\n  In addition, this legislation would correct the inequity in the \ncurrent policy which unfairly discriminates between beneficiaries who \nreceive their prescription drugs from commercial pharmacies and those \nwho receive their medications through PAPs or from safety net \npharmacies run by the IHS, community health centers, and certain public \nhospitals. Currently, only commercial pharmacies' waivers or reductions \nin Medicare Part D cost-sharing requirements are allowed to count \ntowards TrOOP. This legislation would prevent lower-income Medicare \nbeneficiaries from getting trapped in the doughnut hole by leveling the \nplaying field so that beneficiaries who get their drugs through PAPs or \npharmacies run by the IHS, community health centers, or public \nhospitals pharmacies can move just as quickly toward the catastrophic \ncoverage benefit.\n  Mr. President, I urge your support for this important legislation to \nallow Part D-related costs incurred by ADAPs, IHS, federally qualified \nhealth centers, and certain safety net hospitals as well as \npharmaceutical manufacturer PAPs to count toward a beneficiary's TrOOP \nexpenses. This bill would ensure that all Part D enrollees are \npermitted appropriate access to the catastrophic coverage that was \npromised under the MMA.\n  Mr. President, I commend to my colleagues the New England Journal of \nMedicine study entitled ``Unintended Consequences of Caps on Medicare \nDrug Benefits,'' and I ask unanimous consent that the Washington Post \narticle and the text of the bill to be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3650\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Cornyn, Mrs. \nHutchison) proposed an amendment to the bill H.R. 5441, making \nappropriations for the Department of Homeland Security for the fiscal \nyear ending September 30, 2007, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       On page 127, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following:\n\n[[Page S7430]]\n\n              TITLE VI--BORDER LAW ENFORCEMENT RELIEF ACT\n\n     SEC. 601. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Border Law Enforcement \n     Relief Act of 2006''\n\n     SEC. 602. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) It is the obligation of the Federal Government of the \n     United States to adequately secure the Nation's borders and \n     prevent the flow of undocumented persons and illegal drugs \n     into the United States.\n       (2) Despite the fact that the United States Border Patrol \n     apprehends over 1,000,000 people each year trying to \n     illegally enter the United States, according to the \n     Congressional Research Service, the net growth in the number \n     of unauthorized aliens has increased by approximately 500,000 \n     each year. The Southwest border accounts for approximately 94 \n     percent of all migrant apprehensions each year. Currently, \n     there are an estimated 11,000,000 unauthorized aliens in the \n     United States.\n       (3) The border region is also a major corridor for the \n     shipment of drugs. According to the El Paso Intelligence \n     Center, 65 percent of the narcotics that are sold in the \n     markets of the United States enter the country through the \n     Southwest Border.\n       (4) Border communities continue to incur significant costs \n     due to the lack of adequate border security. A 2001 study by \n     the United States-Mexico Border Counties Coalition found that \n     law enforcement and criminal justice expenses associated with \n     illegal immigration exceed $89,000,000 annually for the \n     Southwest border counties.\n       (5) In August 2005, the States of New Mexico and Arizona \n     declared states of emergency in order to provide local law \n     enforcement immediate assistance in addressing criminal \n     activity along the Southwest border.\n       (6) While the Federal Government provides States and \n     localities assistance in covering costs related to the \n     detention of certain criminal aliens and the prosecution of \n     Federal drug cases, local law enforcement along the border \n     are provided no assistance in covering such expenses and must \n     use their limited resources to combat drug trafficking, human \n     smuggling, kidnappings, the destruction of private property, \n     and other border-related crimes.\n       (7) The United States shares 5,525 miles of border with \n     Canada and 1,989 miles with Mexico. Many of the local law \n     enforcement agencies located along the border are small, \n     rural departments charged with patrolling large areas of \n     land. Counties along the Southwest United States-Mexico \n     border are some of the poorest in the country and lack the \n     financial resources to cover the additional costs associated \n     with illegal immigration, drug trafficking, and other border-\n     related crimes.\n       (8) Federal assistance is required to help local law \n     enforcement operating along the border address the unique \n     challenges that arise as a result of their proximity to an \n     international border and the lack of overall border security \n     in the region\n\n     SEC. 603.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nJudiciary Committee be discharged from further consideration, and the \nSenate now proceed to S. Res. 499.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 499) designating September 9, 2006, \n     as ``National Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders Awareness \n     Day.''\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, in June of this year, parents of \nchildren afflicted with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders and their \nadvocates traveled to our Nation's Capital for the annual FASD Hill \nDay. FASD Hill Day is sponsored by the National Organization on Fetal \nAlcohol Syndrome and organizations that support those who care for FASD \nchildren in our States and communities.\n  Nobody knows better than a parent of a child afflicted with FASD how \nchallenging it is to raise a child who was exposed to alcohol before \nbirth. Nobody knows better the physical, mental, behavioral and \nlearning disabilities that can have lifelong implications. I hope that \nmy colleagues had the opportunity to meet with the parents and \nadvocates who participated in FASD Hill Day because they had a very \nimportant story to tell. I am sure their stories moved you, as they did \nme.\n  At the conclusion of FASD Hill Day, the National Organization on \nFetal Alcohol Syndrome hosted its annual Leadership Awards Benefit \nReception, which was attended by the parents and advocates, as well as \nthe children. I am pleased to inform my colleagues that the \ndistinguished Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Dorgan, received the 2006 \nLeadership Award at the benefit reception. As a Senator who represents \na State with one of the highest incidence rates of fetal alcohol \nspectrum disorders, I appreciate the leadership of Mr. Dorgan and the \nsupport of all our colleagues, in the crusade to eradicate FASD.\n  The term ``fetal alcohol spectrum disorders'' was coined by experts \nas an umbrella term to describe the range of effects that can occur in \nan individual whose mother drank alcohol during pregnancy. It refers to \nconditions such as fetal alcohol syndrome, fetal alcohol effects, \nalcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder and alcohol-related birth \ndefects.\n  The only cause of FASD is alcohol use during pregancy. When a \npregnant woman drinks, the alcohol crosses the placenta into the fetal \nblood system, reaching the fetus, its developing tissues, and organs. \nThis is how brain damage occurs, which in turn can lead to mental \nretardation, social and emotional problems, learning disabilities and \nother problems. It will shock my\n\n[[Page S7443]]\n\ncolleagues to know that FASD is the leading cause of mental retardation \nin all of Western civilization, including the United States.\n  By abstaining from the consumption of alcohol during pregnancy a \nwoman can be 100 percent certain that her baby will not be born with \nany of the conditions regarded as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. \nEvery day of the year we must remind women that no amount of alcohol \nconsumed during pregnancy is safe for their baby. No alcohol during \npregnancy is safe. None at all.\n  To dramatize this point, a group of parents raising children \nafflicted with FASD came together on the Internet and wondered in \ncyberspace, ``What if a world full of FASD parents came together on the \n9th hour of the 9th day of the 9th month of the year and asked the \nworld to remember that during the 9 months of pregnancy a woman should \nnot consume alcohol?'' If this were to occur, they wondered, ``Would \nthe world listen?''\n  These pioneering activists, many of whom were adoptive and foster \nparents, organized the first International Fetal Alcohol Syndrome \nAwareness Day, which was observed on September 9, 1999. On the 9th hour \nof the 9th day of the 9th month every year they call upon all the \npeoples of this Nation, and all the peoples of this world, to observe a \nmoment of silence to remind women of childbearing age that no amount of \nalcohol is safe during pregnancy. Their group continues to grow, \nincluding more than 70 volunteer coordinators in eight countries. \nThrough this grassroots awareness effort, many women of childbearing \nage are learning that no amount of alcohol during pregnancy is safe.\n  On September 9, 2004, for the first time, the moment of silence was \nobserved on the Senate floor. It is my hope that the Senate honor this \nmoment every year until fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are \neradicated.\n  The resolution that I have introduced, S. Res. 499, designates \nSeptember 9, 2006, as National Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Awareness Day. I \nthank my colleagues for their consideration and support of this \nresolution, which is so very important to the millions of Americans who \nare touched by FASD.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 499) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 499\n\n       Whereas the term ``fetal alcohol spectrum disorders'' \n     includes a broader range of conditions and therefore has \n     replaced the term ``fetal alcohol syndrome'' as the umbrella \n     term describing the range of effects that can occur in an \n     individual whose mother drank alcohol during pregnancy;\n       Whereas fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are the leading \n     cause of mental retardation in western civilization, \n     including the United States, and are 100 percent preventable;\n       Whereas fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are a major cause \n     of numerous social disorders, including learning \n     disabilities, school failure, juvenile delinquency, \n     homelessness, unemployment, mental illness, and crime;\n       Whereas the incidence rate of fetal alcohol syndrome is \n     estimated at 1 out of 500 live births and the incidence rate \n     of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders is estimated at 1 out of \n     every 100 live births;\n       Whereas the economic cost of fetal alcohol syndrome alone \n     to the Nation was $5,400,000,000 in 2003 and it is estimated \n     that each individual with fetal alcohol syndrome will cost \n     taxpayers of the United States between $1,500,000 and \n     $3,000,000 in his or her lifetime;\n       Whereas, in February 1999, a small group of parents of \n     children who suffer from fetal alcohol spectrum disorders \n     came together with the hope that in 1 magic moment the world \n     could be made aware of the devastating consequences of \n     alcohol consumption during pregnancy;\n       Whereas the first International Fetal Alcohol Syndrome \n     Awareness Day was observed on September 9, 1999;\n       Whereas Bonnie Buxton of Toronto, Canada, the co-founder of \n     the first International Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Awareness Day, \n     asked ``What if . . . a world full of FAS/E [Fetal Alcohol \n     Syndrome/Effect] parents all got together on the ninth hour \n     of the ninth day of the ninth month of the year and asked the \n     world to remember that during the 9 months of pregnancy a \n     woman should not consume alcohol . . . would the rest of the \n     world listen?''; and\n       Whereas on the ninth day of the ninth month of each year \n     since 1999, communities around the world have observed \n     International Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Awareness Day: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates September 9, 2006, as ``National Fetal \n     Alcohol Spectrum Disorders Awareness Day''; and\n       (2) calls upon the people of the United States--\n       (A) to observe National Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders \n     Awareness Day with appropriate ceremonies--\n       (i) to promote awareness of the effects of prenatal \n     exposure to alcohol;\n       (ii) to increase compassion for individuals affected by \n     prenatal exposure to alcohol;\n       (iii) to minimize further effects of prenatal exposure to \n     alcohol; and\n       (iv) to ensure healthier communities across the United \n     States; and\n       (B) to observe a moment of reflection on the ninth hour of \n     September 9, 2006, to remember that during the 9 months of \n     pregnancy a woman should not consume alcohol.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/12/senate-section/article/S7443-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7443-S7444]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  NATIONAL MOTTO OF THE UNITED STATES\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Res. 96\n\n       Whereas the phrase ``In God We Trust'' is the national \n     motto of the United States;\n       Whereas, from the colonial beginnings of the United States, \n     citizens of the Nation have officially acknowledged their \n     dependence on God;\n       Whereas, in 1694, the phrase ``God Preserve Our Carolina \n     and the Lords Proprietors'' was engraved on the Carolina cent \n     and the phrase ``God Preserve Our New England'' was inscribed \n     on coins that were minted in New England during that year;\n       Whereas, while declaring the independence of the United \n     States from Great Britain, the Founding Fathers of the Nation \n     asserted: ``We hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all \n     Men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator \n     with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, \n     Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.'';\n       Whereas those signers of the Declaration of Independence \n     further declared: ``And for the support of this Declaration, \n     with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, \n     we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and \n     our sacred Honor.'';\n       Whereas, in 1782, one of the great leaders of the United \n     States, Thomas Jefferson, wrote: ``[C]an the liberties of a \n     nation be thought secure when we have removed their only firm \n     basis, a conviction in the minds of the people that these \n     liberties are the gift of God? That they are not to be \n     violated but with His wrath?'';\n       Whereas the distinguished founding statesman, Benjamin \n     Franklin, when speaking in 1787 at the Constitutional \n     Convention, declared: ``Our prayers, Sir, were heard, and \n     they were graciously answered. All of us who were engaged in \n     the struggle must have observed frequent instances of a \n     Superintending providence in our favor. To that kind \n     providence we owe this happy opportunity of consulting in \n     peace on the means of establishing our future national \n     felicity. And have we now forgotten that powerful friend? or \n     do we imagine that we no longer need His assistance. I have \n     lived, Sir, a long time and the longer I live, the more \n     convincing proofs I see of this truth -- that God governs in \n     the affairs of men. And if a sparrow cannot fall to the \n     ground without his notice, is it probable that an empire can \n     rise without his aid? We have been assured, Sir, in the \n     sacred writings that `except the Lord build they labor in \n     vain that build it.' I firmly believe this; and I also \n     believe that without his concurring aid we shall succeed in \n     this political building no better than the Builders of Babel. \n     . . .'';\n       Whereas the national hero and first President, George \n     Washington, proclaimed in his first inaugural address in \n     1789: ``[I]t would be peculiarly improper to omit in this \n     first official act my fervent supplications to that Almighty \n     Being who rules over the universe, who presides in the \n     councils of nations, and\n\n[[Page S7444]]\n\n     whose providential aids can supply every human defect, that \n     His benediction may consecrate to the liberties and the \n     happiness of the people of the United States a government \n     instituted by themselves for these essential purposes, and \n     may enable every instrument employed in its administration to \n     execute with success the functions allotted to his charge.'';\n       Whereas one stanza of the ``Star Spangled Banner'', which \n     was written by Francis Scott Key in 1814 and adopted as the \n     national anthem of the United States in 1931, states: ``O \n     thus be it ever when free-men shall stand, Between their \n     lov'd home and the war's desolation; Blest with vict'ry and \n     peace, may the heav'n-rescued land Praise the Pow'r that hath \n     made and preserv'd us as a nation! Then conquer we must, when \n     our cause it is just, And this be our motto: `In God is our \n     trust!' And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave \n     O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave!'';\n       Whereas, in 1861, the Secretary of the Treasury, Salmon P. \n     Chase, while instructing James Pollock, Director of the Mint \n     at Philadelphia, to prepare a motto, stated: ``No nation can \n     be strong except in the strength of God, or safe except in \n     His defense. The trust of our people in God should be \n     declared on our national coins. You will cause a device to be \n     prepared without unnecessary delay with a motto expressing in \n     the fewest and tersest words possible this national \n     recognition.'';\n       Whereas the phrase ``In God We Trust'' first appeared on a \n     coin of the United States in 1864;\n       Whereas, in 1955, the phrase ``In God We Trust'' was \n     designated as a mandatory phrase to be inscribed on all \n     currency and coins of the United States;\n       Whereas, on March 28, 1956, the Judiciary Committee of the \n     House of Representatives, in its report accompanying H. J. \n     Res. 396 (84th Congress), stated: ``It will be of great \n     spiritual and psychological value to our country to have a \n     clearly designated national motto of inspirational quality in \n     plain, popularly accepted English.'';\n       Whereas, on July 30, 1956, President Dwight D. Eisenhower \n     signed H. J. Res. 396 (84th Congress), making the phrase ``In \n     God We Trust'' the official motto of the United States; and\n       Whereas the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the formal \n     adoption of the national motto of the United States, ``In God \n     We Trust'', presents an opportunity for the citizens of the \n     United States to reaffirm the concept embodied in that motto \n     that--\n       (1) the proper role of civil government is derived from the \n     consent of the governed, who are endowed by their Creator \n     with certain unalienable Rights; and\n       (2) the success of civil government relies firmly on the \n     protection of divine Providence: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) commemorates the 50th anniversary of the national motto \n     of the United States, ``In God We Trust'';\n       (2) celebrates the national motto as--\n       (A) a fundamental aspect of the national life of the \n     citizens of the United States; and\n       (B) a phrase that is central to the hopes and vision of the \n     Founding Fathers for the perpetuity of the United States;\n       (3) reaffirms today that the substance of the national \n     motto is no less vital to the future success of the Nation; \n     and\n       (4) encourages the citizens of the United States to reflect \n     on--\n       (A) the national motto of the United States; and\n       (B) the integral part that the national motto of the United \n     States has played in the life of the Nation, before and after \n     its official adoption.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/12/senate-section/article/S7444-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7444]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  LOUIS BRAILLE BICENTENNIAL--BRAILLE LITERACY COMMEMORATIVE COIN ACT\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.
