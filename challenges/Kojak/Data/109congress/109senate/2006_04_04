Mr. President, on Sunday evening, severe storms and \ntornadoes struck the western part of Tennessee, leaving a damage trail \n25 miles long and a quarter to a half mile wide throughout Dyer County. \nIt really struck two counties, Dyer and Gibson. The assessment is \nunderway. About 2,000 homes and businesses have been destroyed or \nsuffered substantial damage, a devastating blow to these small rural \ncommunities which have suffered the greatest impact from the storm. \nThere have been reported 23 fatalities that have been confirmed as a \nresult of the tragedy. A number of other Tennesseans--right now, the \ncount is roughly 82--have been injured, 17 critically. This morning, I \noffer my deepest sympathy to the loved ones, the families that have \nbeen affected. My thoughts go out to those recovering from these \nunforeseen events.\n  Governor Bredesen has requested a major disaster declaration for the \nState, and yesterday I asked the President for expeditious review and \napproval of Tennessee's request for assistance. I spoke yesterday with \nthe Acting Director of FEMA, David Paulison, as well to express my \nstrong support for the State's request. I will continue working with \nthe administration and my colleagues in the Tennessee delegation to \nensure State and local officials have the resources they need to assist \nour communities.\n  Again, our thoughts and prayers go out to all of the families \naffected.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/04/senate-section/article/S2759-8", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2759-S2760]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           IMMIGRATION REFORM\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I wish to comment on the immigration reform \ndebate. Our borders are dangerously porous, and our immigration system \nis flatout broken. That is why it is so important for us to debate and \nfocus on the issue of immigration reform and to bring that debate to \nclosure over the course of this week. It is my hope that by Friday we \nwill have a bill that is fair and equitable, that gives priority to our \nsecurity concerns and at the same time respects America's strong and \nproud immigrant tradition. We are a nation of the rule of law and a \nstrong nation of immigrant heritage.\n\n[[Page S2760]]\n\n  Last October, I met with a number of Senators, including Senators \nCornyn and McCain, to discuss my intention to bring the immigration \nissue to the floor this spring. Why? Because the system is broken. \nThere are millions of people coming across our borders, 25 percent \ngrowth last year in illegal immigrants coming across our borders. It is \nbroken. It is broken at the borders, in the interior. And our temporary \nworker program is broken.\n  I laid out at that time a specific plan for border security where we \nhad broad agreement and then build on the consensus of border security \nwith a comprehensive approach that included what happens on the \ninterior; that is, the worksite, workplace enforcement, as well as, in \nthe third dimension, fixing the temporary worker program.\n  Over last week and the first part of this week, we have followed the \nplan laid out last October. We started with strong border control and \nexpanded to interior and worksite enforcement, as well as what I hope \nwill be a fair, equitable, commonsense temporary worker program. All \nthree elements are necessary.\n  I am optimistic that by staying focused and by working together--\nagain, this is not a partisan issue, as the Democratic leader knows in \ntalking to his caucus and as I know in talking to my caucus, this is \nnot a Republican or Democratic issue; it is a challenge for all of us \nto put together a workable, realistic immigration reform bill--we can \nforge a plan that deals effectively with our national security, that \nprotects the rule of law, and that recognizes that our economic \ninterests can be reflected in strong legal immigration programs.\n  What we cannot support, however, is amnesty. To me, amnesty is when \nyou give someone who has clearly broken the law a leg up on the pathway \nto citizenship. Giving illegal immigrants a special path to citizenship \nessentially rewards people who have broken the law. It simply doesn't \nmake sense when you have other law-abiding people around the world who \nare being disadvantaged. You are punishing people who follow the law. \nTo give amnesty, as we did in the 1980s and as some propose to do \ntoday, simply sends a strong signal to the world or to anybody who \nwould like to come to America that they don't need to obey the law; if \nyou sneak into this country, eventually there is going to be another \nround of amnesty. That aggravates the problem. It creates a magnet to \nattract people to this country illegally.\n  Twelve million illegal immigrants now reside in the United States. We \nhear the figures--11 million, 12 million, or is it 21 million? We don't \nreally know because they are illegal immigrants. We don't know what \ntheir names are. We don't know where they are. We don't know exactly \nwhat they are doing. One of the goals has to be to bring them out of \nthe shadows.\n  What has become increasingly clear from our discussion in the Senate \nis that this is not a monolithic group, these 12 million people. Forty \npercent have been here longer than 10 years. In all likelihood, they \nare much better assimilated, maybe fully assimilated into our society \ntoday. Forty percent have been here less than 5 years. It may be that \nwe will need to break down this group and look at it. Maybe the 40 \npercent who have been here for greater than 5 years should have some \naccess to a green card, and the 40 percent who have only been here a \nfew months or maybe even a couple years could be dealt with \ndifferently. It is not a monolithic group. A successful, realistic \nimmigration program has to acknowledge the different groups and treat \nthem accordingly. Only then do I believe that we can succeed in getting \nthe 12 million people out of the shadows, encouraging them to identify \nthemselves and then function within the system.\n  In addition, I support a strong and fair temporary worker program \nthat allows people to fill what employment needs we have, to learn a \nskill, to send money home, to return to their hometowns to help build \nand develop their communities. As I said last October, we need this \nthree-pronged approach which begins with border security, strengthens \nworkplace enforcement, and offers a fair and realistic temporary worker \nprogram for the hard-working men and women who come to this country to \nearn for their families back home. All three elements are vital. All \nthree require action. Only a comprehensive approach will fix this \nbroken system.\n  I look forward to continuing our debate this week. I am optimistic \nthat by working together and applying a little common sense, we will \ncome up with a plan that gets the job done and makes America safer and \nmore secure.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to respond briefly to the \nmajority leader.\n  Pending before the Senate is a historic piece of legislation, maybe \none of the most important bills we have considered in years. We are \ntrying to fix a broken immigration system. It is entirely broken. \nEveryone concedes that our borders are out of control. At this point, \nwe cannot control the flow of people across our borders, and we have no \nidea who is coming and going and staying in America. We couldn't afford \nthat in normal circumstances. We can't afford it, certainly, when we \nare facing a war on terrorism where security is paramount.\n  The bill we have before us says: Let's fix the borders. Let's make \nsure we have the appropriate number of officers on the borders, the \ntechnology so that people are not coming across illegally. Let's do it \nright.\n  After 5 years of failure under this administration, we need to have \nborders that are better and stronger, and we need to know who is \ncoming.\n  Secondly, we have to acknowledge that there are 11 or 12 million \npeople in America who are not legally recognized. They are here. They \nare working every day. They are an important part of our economy, but \nthey are not legally recognized. The question before us is, How do we \nbring them out of the shadows to the point where we know who they are, \nwhere they live, and where they work? The only way to do that is to \ncreate an opportunity for them to reach legal status. But it is \nsomething they have to earn, not just automatically, not amnesty, no \nfree ride. Don't put them in the front of the line but say to them: If \nyou are willing to struggle hard for 10 or 11 years and meet those \nrequirements, we will give you a chance for the legal pathway to \ncitizenship. That is what this bill is all about.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/04/senate-section/article/S2760-1", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2760]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will proceed to executive session.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Michael A. Chagares, of \nNew Jersey, to be United States Circuit Judge for the Third Circuit.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the time \nuntil 10 a.m. shall be equally divided for debate.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for the \nconfirmation of Michael Chagares to a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals \nfor the Third Circuit.\n  A Federal judge must be fair, impartial, and well-qualified. I \nstrongly believe that if you look at Mr. Chagares' record and his \nappearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee, it is obvious that he \nis the right person for this assignment.\n  Mr. Chagares is currently in private practice, but he served in the \nU.S. Attorney's office in New Jersey for 14 years.\n  Through hard work and diligence, he rose to become the head of the \ncivil division, where he supervised and managed all civil cases on \nbehalf of the United States Government, its agencies and officials. He \noversaw litigation, directed legal positions to be taken in court, and \napproved settlements.\n  Before he became head of the civil division, Mr. Chagares directed \nthe Affirmative Civil Enforcement Unit of the U.S. Attorney's Office \nfor several years. During his tenure in the U.S. Attorney's office, Mr. \nChagares received a\n\n[[Page S2761]]\n\nnumber of awards and commendations, including two director's awards for \nsuperior performance as an assistant U.S. Attorney.\n  Mr. Chagares is a graduate of Seton Hall Law School in Newark, where \nhe has also taught as an adjunct professor since 1991.\n  His familiarity with the Third Circuit goes back to the late 1980s, \nwhen he worked as a law clerk for the honorable Morton Greenberg.\n  The Third Circuit is based in Philadelphia, and it considers appeals \nfrom Federal district courts in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware. \nIt is a vitally important court, and his is an important seat, as he \nwill replace Michael Chertoff, who left the court to serve as Secretary \nof the Department of Homeland Security.\n  I hope my colleagues agree with me that Mr. Chagares is more than \nqualified for this position, and I hope they will join me in voting for \nhis confirmation.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this morning, the Senate will confirm \nMichael Chagares to a lifetime appointment to the U.S. Court of Appeals \nfor the Third Circuit. This confirmation will bring the total number of \njudicial appointments since January 2001 to 235, including the \nconfirmations of 2 Supreme Court Justices and 44 circuit court judges. \nOf course, 100 judges were confirmed during the 17 months when there \nwas a Democratic majority in the Senate. In the other 45 months, under \nRepublican control, only 135 judges have been confirmed. Ironically, \nthe Senate was almost twice as productive under Democratic leadership \nas under Republican leadership.\n  Recently, President Bush withdrew the nominations of Judge Henry Saad \nto the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals and Judge Daniel P. Ryan to the \nEastern District of Michigan. These withdrawals are long overdue and \nbring to a close a sad chapter in history of judicial confirmations \nwhen the President and the chairman of the Judiciary Committee ignored \nopposition to nominations by the home State Senators.\n  Even with negative blue slips opposing the nominations in 2003 from \nthe home State Senators, the former Judiciary Committee chairman took \nthe position to ignore them and proceed with hearing and to force the \nSaad nomination through the committee on a party-line vote. That was \nthe first time the committee voted on a nominee with two negative blue \nslips and it may have been the first time any chairman and any Senate \nJudiciary Committee proceeded with a hearing on a judicial nominee over \nthe objection of both home State Senators. It is certainly the first \ntime in the last 50 years, and I know it was the first time during my \n32 years in the Senate.\n  When Chairman Hatch chaired this committee and we were considering \nthe nominations of a Democratic President, one negative blue slip from \none home State Senator was enough to doom a nomination and prevent a \nhearing on that nomination. Indeed, among the more than 60 Clinton \njudicial nominees who this committee did not consider there were \nseveral who were blocked in spite of the positive blue slips from both \nhome State Senators. So long as one Republican Senator had an \nobjection, it appeared to be honored, whether that was Senator Helms \nobjecting to an African-American nominee from Virginia or Senator \nGorton objecting to nominees from California.\n  The blue-slip policy in effect, and enforced strictly, by the \nRepublican chairman during the Clinton administration operated as an \nabsolute bar to the consideration of any nominee to any court unless \nboth home State Senators had returned positive blue slips. No time \nlimit was set, and no reason had to be articulated. Remember, before I \nbecame chairman in June of 2001, all of these decisions were being made \nin secret. Blue slips were not public, and they were allowed to operate \nas an anonymous hold on otherwise qualified nominees. In the 106th \nCongress alone, more than half of President Clinton's circuit court \nnominees were defeated through the operation of the blue slip or other \nsuch partisan obstruction.\n\n  Perhaps the best documented abuses occurred in the Sixth Circuit, \nwhen the nominations of Judge Helene White, Kathleen McCree Lewis, and \nProfessor Kent Markus to that court were blocked. Judge White and Ms. \nLewis were themselves Michigan nominees. Republicans in the Senate \nprevented consideration of any of President Clinton's nominees to the \nSixth Circuit for years. When I became chairman in 2001, I ended that \nimpasse. Under Democratic leadership, in spite of the abuses by \nRepublicans, we proceeded to consider and confirm 2 nominees to the \nSixth Circuit among the 17 circuit judges we were able to confirm in \nour 17 months. We have continued to confirm judges, and the vacancies \nthat once plagued the Sixth Circuit have been cut dramatically. Where \nRepublican obstruction led to 8 vacancies on that 16-judge court, \nDemocratic cooperation has allowed these vacancies to be filled and \nonly 2 remain. The Sixth Circuit currently has more judges and fewer \nvacancies than it has had in years.\n  Ignoring the opposition of Michigan's Senators, President Bush \nrenominated Judges Saad and Ryan in 2005 rather than nominate consensus \nnominees for those vacancies that could be easily confirmed. In fact, \nJudge Ryan's nomination was not withdrawn until last week even though \nhe received a majority ``not qualified'' rating from the American Bar \nAssociation in March 2005. I look forward to the White House \nreconsidering its confrontational posture and working with the Senate \nto send to the Senate well-qualified nominees who can be confirmed with \nthe support of Michigan's Senators.\n  These are not the only nominations the President has withdrawn \nrecently. Last month, the President also withdrew the nomination of \nJames Payne to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals after information \nbecame public about that nominee's rulings in a number of cases in \nwhich he appears to have had a conflict of interest. Those conflicts \nwere pointed out not by the administration's screening process or by \nthe ABA but by online journalists.\n  As I discussed last month, at a minimum that case and the other \nwithdrawals reinforce concerns about this White House's poor vetting \nprocess for important nominations which became apparent with the \nwithdrawals of Bernard Kerik to head Homeland Security, Harriet Miers \nto the Supreme Court, and Claude Allen to be a Fourth Circuit judge. It \nwas not the administration's vetting but reporting in a national \nmagazine that doomed the Kerik nomination. It was opposition within the \nPresident's own party that doomed the Miers nomination. Democratic \nSenators resisted the nomination of Allen, a Virginian, because the \nPresident was seeking to appoint someone from another State to a \nMaryland seat on the Fourth Circuit. Unfortunately, rather than being \nthorough in selecting lifetime appointments of judicial officers who \nare entrusted with protecting the rights of Americans, all too often \nthis White House seems more interested in rewarding cronies and picking \npolitical fights.\n  As today's confirmation demonstrates, Democrats in the Senate \ncooperate with this White House when it focuses on sending the Senate \nqualified consensus nominees. Unfortunately, as the recent withdrawals \ndemonstrate, this White House too often does not want to cooperate with \nus.\n  I congratulate the nominee and his family on his confirmation today.\n  Is all time yielded back on the nomination?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield back all time on the minority side and ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Michael A. Chagares, of New Jersey, to be United States Circuit \nJudge for the Third Circuit?\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, we have a number of people who want to \nspeak on both sides, and the distinguished chairman is here. I was \ngoing to ask unanimous consent--let me discuss one thing first before I \ndo--to first allow the two distinguished Senators from Florida to speak \nbriefly on a matter not involving immigration but involving----\n  Mr. CRAIG. Does that have to do with basketball?\n  Mr. LEAHY. A group by the name of the Gators.\n  But before they do that--I hope to maybe go back and forth--I would \nlike to ask to be able to lock in on this side, realizing that we will \nprobably go the traditional way, back and forth on the bill on both \nsides, that it would be Senators Nelson, Menendez, Lieberman, Salazar, \nDurbin, and Kennedy.\n  What I was going to recommend is we ask people to be able to speak in \n15-minute blocks, each one of them speaking for 15 minutes, realizing \nthat if we work it this way, I would imagine the distinguished chairman \nwould want 15 minutes on his side, and go back and forth.\n  So I would propound that following discussion by Senators Nelson and \nMartinez, recognizing the significant accomplishment for Florida, we \nhave 15 minutes a side for discussion and that the Senators on our side \nin the slotted times be Senator Nelson of Florida, Senator Menendez, \nSenator Lieberman, Senator Salazar, Senator Durbin, and Senator \nKennedy.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I may \nwell object, the question that comes to my mind is, When are we going \nto proceed to consider amendments and try to move the bill? When the \ndistinguished ranking member says to give the chairman a chance to \nspeak--I have spoken enough. We went on this bill on Wednesday \nafternoon and we spoke all day Thursday, and there weren't too many \nspeakers around on Friday, but there was an opportunity to speak. And \nwe were here yesterday afternoon, and not too many speakers pursued an \nopportunity to speak.\n  So the question that I have--and perhaps I can better talk to Senator \nLeahy about it privately--when are we going to move to amendments? We \nneed to finish this bill this week, and I would like to move to \namendments.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Wait a minute. I don't know who has the floor, but I \nwill yield to you.\n  Mr. LEAHY. No, no. Finish what you were saying.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, Senator Kyl is ready to offer an \namendment. Senator Allard is ready to offer an amendment. I see Senator \nKennedy with his portfolio; maybe he has an amendment. I would like to \nmove to amendments to try to move the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I know there are amendments on both sides. \nI have already stated my admiration for the way the Senator from \nPennsylvania moved this bill through the committee and on to the floor. \nI would like to have finished the bill last week, and I share his sense \nof urgency to finish. I suspect there will be discussions about this in \nboth the caucuses this noon. I wonder if possibly the Senator from \nPennsylvania and I, and whomever else he would like, could try to sit \ndown and work out an order for amendments so that we can move forward. \nBut that probably will not happen until after the caucuses, and I \nthought we could at least have others speak. I have spoken, and I will \ninclude another statement for the legislative record this morning. But \nI think if we get Senators down here to talk about it, we can also work \nout the time for amendments.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, would the Senator from Vermont yield for a \nquestion from me regarding this unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Of course.\n  Mr. KYL. That would not preclude the offering of an amendment by \nunanimous consent?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, for offering an amendment, it would \nrequire, of course, unanimous consent. I have not included, just \nbecause it gets too complicated--that is why I wanted to work out with \nthe distinguished chairman when such amendments might be offered. It \nwould allow Senators to speak, but any Senator speaking, if they wanted \nto offer an amendment, would still require unanimous consent then. \nRather than trying to micromanage this all the way down the line, I \nwill let each Senator make that request.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Senator. I just wanted to get an amendment \npending but not to speak on it.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, we are only going to move ahead if we \ncome to an understanding; I recognize that. If the Senator from Vermont \nwants to have a speaking sequence, I will not object, and we can \nretreat from here into his cloakroom to try to figure out when we are \ngoing to move the bill. We are giving up almost 2 hours; perhaps we can \nwork this evening to make up that time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I have an amendment I am ready to offer, \nand I would like to speak to that amendment. So the way the agreement \nis being put together now, I will be expected not to offer that \namendment until after we have had more discussion between both sides; \nis that correct?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I think Senator Allard accurately states \nit. When he has his 15 minutes, nothing will stop him from talking \nabout the amendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. That is right.\n  Mr. SPECTER. And he can lay the groundwork so that when he does offer \nthe amendment later, he will not have to speak quite as long.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senator from Pennsylvania states it \naccurately. A number of Senators, I suspect, on both sides are going to \ntalk about amendments they intend to offer. Unanimous consent will not \nbe given for anybody to offer an amendment on either side during this \ntime, but I would encourage Senators to talk about the amendments they \nintend to offer.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I object to the request.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, any Senator can object. I have been told \nthat there are those on the Republican side who would object to a \nDemocrat offering an amendment, so I suspect there would be similar \nobjections here. But any Senator can speak about his or her amendment. \nAny Senator can offer an amendment. Any Senator can make an objection. \nBut insofar as there are going to be objections on the Republican side \nto some Democratic amendments, and vice versa--there is a\n\n[[Page S2763]]\n\nDemocratic amendment pending, of course, that of Senator Mikulski--I \nthought, until we get to the caucus, at least we could accomplish \nsomething by talking about the amendments we want to offer.\n\n  I will again make a unanimous consent request that after the two \ndistinguished Senators from Florida speak about the Gators, there be 15 \nminutes a side to talk on the bill or amendments Members wish to offer. \nAnd if we do that, again, I realize we would alternate. On the \nDemocratic side it would be Senator Nelson of Florida, Senator \nMenendez, Senator Lieberman, Senator Salazar, Senator Durbin, and \nSenator Kennedy.\n  I renew that request.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, might I direct an inquiry to the Senator from \nVermont?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Certainly, Mr. President.\n  Mr. KYL. If the Senator from Vermont would agree to have the two \nSenators from Florida speak to their State's accomplishment, as you \nnoted it, perhaps we could then work out the rest of it. I simply have \nan amendment I want to lay down and not to speak to it, but I hope \nnobody would object to that. That is what I wish to discuss with the \nSenator. Can we amend the unanimous consent request to get the \nconversation started and we can go back and see what we can work out to \naccommodate Senators?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the two Senators \nfrom Florida be allowed to speak at this point about the Gators as in \nmorning business, but I will then again request at least on our side we \nhave an order of speakers as I have noted.\n  I ask unanimous consent now simply that the two distinguished \nSenators from Florida be allowed to speak as in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/04/senate-section/article/S2763-1", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2763]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CONGRATULATING THE FLORIDA GATORS\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, for anyone who watched on \nnational TV or was privileged to be there in Indianapolis to see the \ngame, there is a profound respect that is now accorded to the \nUniversity of Florida Gators basketball achievement of being the \nnational champions.\n  What teamwork. What individual accomplishment. But in that individual \naccomplishment, what teamwork. For all of that, certainly, a great deal \nof credit has to be given to the coach.\n  Florida has long been known as a football powerhouse. But the \nbasketball coach of the University of Florida has now made it, in \nathletic history, a basketball powerhouse.\n  Floridians are celebrating this morning, as they have celebrated \nthroughout the night, and with just occasion. The Florida Gators, \ncoming in, were not at the top seed. Indeed, at the beginning of the \nseason the Florida Gators were not even ranked. Yet this incredible \ntalent, all melded together in extraordinary teamwork, has produced a \nnational champion.\n  This Senator joins with my colleague from Florida and we offer our \nheartiest congratulations. Later in the day we will be jointly offering \na resolution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I join my colleague from Florida in \ncongratulating the University of Florida, the Florida Gators, Jeremy \nFoley, the athletic director, Billy Donovan, the brilliant head coach, \nand all the members of that very distinguished team in their first \nhistoric national championship in basketball for a Florida school.\n  As a dyed-in-the-wool Florida State Seminole, I must say I take my \nhat off to the Gators. Today is a day for all Floridians to rejoice in \nthis accomplishment and this victory.\n  In this accomplishment we have seen not only the magnificent \nleadership of the coach--and I think he ought to be recognized \nnationally for that--but also this team that worked and performed in \nsuch an unselfish way. We hear the phrase, ``they were an unselfish \nteam.'' In this day and time, when it is the ``me'' culture--so much of \nit is about me, me, me--these guys played as a team. They passed the \nball to each other, they contributed as a team, and all were able to \nmake a contribution. The average margin of victory in the tournament \nwas 16 points, which speaks volumes for this very tremendously \ncompetitive tournament.\n  But focusing on Billy Donovan, he is only 40 years old and is now \ncompeting in his second National Championship game--the unusual feat of \ndoing it as a player with Providence and now doing it as a coach for \nthe University of Florida. John Wooten, the much heralded and historic \ncoach at UCLA who actually led the Bruins to victory against Florida \nState in 1972 in the final game, was at UCLA for 15 years before he won \nhis first national title. Billy Donovan is way ahead of that mark.\n  Today is a terrific day to rejoice, for all Floridians to rejoice for \nthis great accomplishment of teamwork, of a job well done. I will be \nvery happy to join with the senior Senator from Florida in a joint \nresolution that we will make part of the record.\n  I want to make sure all in Gainesville and throughout the State know \nhow proud we are here in the Nation's Capitol of the accomplishment of \nthose young men who played so well and displayed such good \nsportsmanship and unselfishness.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/04/senate-section/article/S2763-2", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2763-S2772]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                SECURING AMERICA'S BORDERS ACT--Resumed\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, now that we are back on the immigration \nbill, I thought I might for a few moments discuss in general some of \nthe provisions in it that I think are extremely important and that are \nbeing discussed by a good number of my colleagues. I understand the \nSenator from Colorado wishes to discuss in general an amendment he will \noffer later. I hope no one would object to that because it does not \nactually offer the amendments but allows the debate to move forward \nwhile the chairman and the ranking member are determining the schedule \nof events here.\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, may it be in order to ask consent that when \nthe distinguished Senator has finished speaking, the senior Senator \nfrom Florida be then recognized to speak, all sides retaining their \nrights, of course, on the offering of amendments?\n  Mr. CRAIG. With the understanding following that the Senator from \nColorado will be recognized? Does that fit his schedule?\n  Mr. ALLARD. That will work out fine for me.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask further consent that following the distinguished \nSenator from Colorado the distinguished Senator from New Jersey, Mr. \nMenendez, be then recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S2764]]\n\n  The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, for at least a few moments this morning, we \nhave an order to continue discussion on this critically important \nlegislation. Let me say in general that S. 2454, attempting to be a \ncomprehensive reform of national immigration law, setting forth very \nstrict border control efforts, authorizing tremendous expenditures for \nthe purpose of controlling our borders, is a bill that finally is \nawakening the Senate. Some of us have been engaged in the debate on \nimmigration for a good number of years, but many of my colleagues have, \nfor whatever reason, chosen not to be. They are busy. But there is no \nquestion in my mind and I think the minds of almost every Senator today \nthat the American people have said immigration reform is a priority, \nborder control is a priority: Congress, get with it. We no longer can, \nnor should we, tolerate within our boundaries whatever that number is--\n7 million, 8 million, 9 million? If you want to listen to Lou Dobbs on \ntelevision, he will say it is 20 million. Lou Dobbs doesn't know, nor \ndo we know, exactly how many undocumented foreign nationals are here.\n  We do know some fundamental basics. If we do not control our borders, \nif we do not control in-migration, in time we can lose our character as \na country. We are a nation of immigrants and we are proud of it. We \nare, as has been said by many, over a historic period of time, a \nmelting pot of the world. It has proved us as a nation to be unique. It \nhas given us our strength. It makes us something no other nation is. \nHow many people can become Japanese? How many people can become an \nItalian? How many people can become a German? Any one of those \nnationalities can become an American. Why? It is the uniqueness of our \ncountry.\n  But in becoming an American, we have always put parameters around it. \nWe have always said you had to study, you had to learn, you had to move \nyourself into the American culture and the American dream. You had to \nhave, and we allowed, an assimilation. What we have lost in the last \ntwo decades by not controlling our borders is that very assimilation in \nthe style with which it operated in the past.\n  Many of us, and most Americans, wish to regain that. It isn't that we \ndeny our heritage; we are tremendously proud we are a nation of \nimmigrants. We want to continue that tradition. It is our strength. But \nin doing so, you control your borders, you control the in-migration, \nand you do so in an orderly fashion.\n  If we control our borders, if we are successful in shutting them down \nand only allowing to move through that which is legal, in an orderly \nfashion, what do we do then? With the unknown number of some 8 or 10 \nmillion foreign nationals who are here illegally, what do we do with \nthem? Mr. President, 99 percent of them are hard workers. Many have \nbeen here for years. They are a part of our economy. They are a part of \nour lifestyle. Most of them are contributors. Very few of them are \ndetractors.\n  A few are. A few are criminals, and they ought to be arrested, if we \ncan find them, and they ought to be thrown out of the country. But what \ndo we do if we take all the rest and toss them out? Who fills those \njobs? Who meets those demands? Who does the kind of work about which \nthe average American citizen today says, ``I won't do that,'' yet it is \ncritically important--for the food on the supermarket shelves of \nAmerica, for the beds in the resorts and the hotels, for the landscape, \nfor construction, for the oil patch. You name it. Illegal foreign \nnationals are everywhere in our economy today whether we like it, \nwhether we are willing to admit it. They are here in part because of \nour negligence, but they are also here because they have been needed, \nbecause our economy asked them to come and there were no restrictions \nfor them to gain entry other than to walk across a border that was \nunguarded and uncontrolled.\n  In that act they broke the law, our law. This bill tries to fix it. I \ncan't tell you on face value it does. What I do know is it will take \nbillions of dollars and a lot of trained personnel to go job site by \njob site to secure those who are illegal and to move them through a \nprocess toward legality or out of the country. I am not sure we are \nprepared to do that yet.\n  I am convinced of one thing: We can control the borders and we \nshould.\n  Starting nearly 5 years ago, I recognized this in American \nagriculture because American agriculture came to me. I have worked with \nthem closely on a variety of issues. And they said: Senator, nearly 70 \npercent of our workforce is illegal and we know it, and it is wrong and \nwe want to fix it because we don't want to be operating on a shaky \nbase. We need these people to pick the crops, to harvest the crops, and \nto process the crops. We need them on a timely basis. They need to be \nreliable. The current system is broken and it doesn't allow it. It only \nidentifies 40-some thousand legal agricultural workers a year, and \nthere are 1.2 million that are necessary. The system is broken.\n  I began to work with them. We worked collectively and came up with a \nbill. We worked with Democrats and Republicans, House and Senate. We \nworked with Hispanic groups, we worked with labor unions, we worked \nwith the farm organizations, and we produced a bill known as AgJOBS. We \nlooked at all of the compromises that had to be made. We tried to \nrecognize those who had been here illegally but had been here for a \nlong while, and those who were just coming and going--the day laborers \non the Mexican-Arizona-California border who come across to work for \nthe day and go back across at night to their homes.\n  This is a phenomenally complicated issue. S. 2454 is the bill that I \nand others crafted known as AgJOBS.\n  For just a few more minutes, I will walk you through one portion of \nit. It is a two-part bill.\n  It deals with those who are currently here working in agriculture, \nand then it goes over and reforms the H-2A guest worker program, to \nstreamline it, to take out the bureaucracy, to make it function in a \nway that is the kind of program that many are talking about today, a \nseasonal worker, guest worker program, to come to work, to go home but \nto recognize the need to treat those folks humanely, to offer to them \nthe jobs that Americans won't do, to assist where we can, to recognize \nthat our economy needs them and they ought to be dealt with \nappropriately.\n  How do we then deal with this 8 million? Let me talk to you this \nmorning not about 8 million but about 1.2 million, just a small window \nbut I believe an opportunity while looking through that window to see \nwhat the rest of America is like and in part what those 8 million \nillegals might be like. It is to recognize them, it is to identify \nthem, it is to have them come forward if they have been here 3 years--\nsince 2003--working and can demonstrate that they worked for 150 days \nin agriculture and then to allow them to earn the right to stay by \ncontinuing to work in agriculture for another 150 days up to 5 years.\n  It is a pilot program. It allows only 1.2 million during that 5-year \nperiod. It allows them to adjust and to gain a blue card--legal working \nstatus.\n  Is it amnesty? Well, somebody will call it that. Others have already \ncalled it that. I call it earning a status. They have to pay a fine. \nThey have to pay a $500 fine. They have to have a background check. If \nthey have a legal record of misconduct and criminal conduct, they don't \nqualify. They will have to be deported.\n  So there is a true tightening of the relationship with these workers, \nbut it is a clear understanding that those workers are needed and \nnecessary in the workforce. Agriculture, like no other business, is \nwhat it is at the time it is. By that I mean when the fruit is ripe, \nyou pick it. If it isn't picked, it rots on the vine.\n  Much of what we do in agriculture is hand labor. It is intensive, \nhard work, backbreaking in the hot Sun kind of labor. The average \nAmerican citizen says: I don't do that kind of work anymore but, oh, do \nwe love the abundance of the supermarket shelf.\n  There are people who will do that work. Many of them are here as \nmigrant workers, illegal foreign nationals doing just that work. They \nsee it as an opportunity because any job in America is better than an \nentry job in Mexico. They come here, earn money, and 90 percent of them \nwant to go home after they have earned their money. They go back to \ntheir nation, Mexico. They can live better than they have\n\n[[Page S2765]]\n\never lived because of the money they earned in America--in the United \nStates. But 90 percent of them say: We don't want to become American \ncitizens. We want to come and work. We are Mexicans. We like being \nMexicans. We are proud of that.\n  The story goes on and on. I will spend more time on the details of \nthis issue.\n  There are those offering amendments to change the AgJOBS provision. \nSome may pass, I don't know. I believe we have a quality product that \nhas been years in the making, not only before the Judiciary Committee \nbut Democrats and Republicans alike. Farm workers and farm \norganizations and American agriculture have been meeting for 5 years to \ntry to identify the problem and to correct it. That work effort is here \nin this bill. It is a quality work effort. It is one that ought to be \ndefended. It is one that clearly recognizes all of the differences in \nthe American economy today and the uniqueness of agriculture.\n  Let me close with this thought. The average illegal in our country \ntoday will say when asked--and they have been asked by people they \ntrust--how long do you stay in an agricultural job? It has been said by \nsome--and I believe it is true because it has been said by those who \nare here in those jobs--they say: We see agriculture as the door to \nentry. We stay there a couple of years. We learn the ropes. We get to \nknow your country a little better, and then we go out to other jobs--\nconstruction, home building, the service industry and oil patch, and a \nvariety of other areas across the country where day laborers, \nbackbreaking labor, hard labor is required as the uniqueness of that \nparticular place of employment.\n  So agriculture is kind of the window, the door of entry that many \ncome and work in before they go elsewhere. That is why it is important, \nno matter what we do, that we try to get this right, to control our \nborders, to begin to identify where the borders are controlled, where \npeople go, and what our needs are and what their needs are and to treat \nthem appropriately and humanely.\n  That is the essence of a part of the bill. Other amendments will come \nas we work through this bill in the coming hours and in the coming \ndays.\n  To all of my fellow citizens who are listening and watching, the \nSenate is now focused. You have asked us to deal with immigration in \none form or another. There are 100 different ideas on how we get it \ndone, some very Draconian and some very forward-looking. I think AgJOBS \nkind of fits in the middle. I think it kind of sorts out the problem. \nIt is a realistic, practical approach to identify how the fruit of \nAmerica literally gets picked in a reasonable, responsible fashion \nwhile at the same time treating those who do that work in a humane and \nappropriate way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, is it my understanding that I \nwill not offer the amendment but will speak on it?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senator from Florida is correct. I am \ntold that amendments will be offered on the side. It would be either \nthe Democrat side or the Republican side. There would be objection but \nSenators agree to speak about amendments and are encouraged to speak \nabout amendments they intend to offer.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. At some \npoint I will be offering amendment No. 3220 and amendment No. 3221. I \nwant to take this opportunity to explain those amendments as we are \ncoming down to the moment of truth and what we are going to do on an \nimmigration bill.\n  It has been the position of this Senator that we have two goals to \nachieve. It is essential in immigration reform that we achieve both of \nthese goals. One is the protection of our borders, not only for the \npurpose of immigration but also for the purpose of protection from \nterrorists infiltrating the country. The other goal is the protection \nof our economy.\n  Where we have in effect American amnesty, as my colleague from \nFlorida has already described, under the existing situation with 11 \nmillion illegal aliens or undocumented workers in this country and \nnothing has been done about it--in effect, amnesty is the de facto \nsituation.\n  How do you accommodate the economic needs of major industries in this \ncountry with the workforce that they need and have 11 million \nundocumented workers come out of the shadows so that they can have a \nlegal status? That is the balance that we are trying to achieve.\n  On the one hand, border security, on the other hand, the provision of \nan economic workforce that will keep the economic engine of this \ncountry humming.\n  I might say that three of the major industries that employ \nundocumented workers are three big industries in the Presiding \nOfficer's State and in my State of Florida; that is, agriculture, the \nconstruction industry, and the service industry, particularly the \ntravel and tourism industry which is very apparent in our States.\n  Finding that right balance is what this is all about. What I want to \ndo is offer a couple of amendments that will help us enhance our border \nsecurity provisions more so than the existing committee bill that has \ncome out of the judiciary. Specifically, what I would like to see based \non the GAO report and also the inspector general's report, which both \nrecommended that with the enhanced electronic surveillance and new \nkinds of technological devices such as unmanned aerial vehicles, that \nwe integrate all of this in more of a comprehensive system that can \ntalk to each other.\n  For example, if we are talking about electronic sensors on a fence, \nthe electronic signal goes off. Instead of that just coming, as the \ncommittee bill would provide, to a Department of Homeland Security \nemployee who then would have to notify someone, that electronic signal \nwould automatically be integrated to activate cameras in that \nparticular area. And you would have this integrated technological \nsystem. That is one of the amendments I will be offering to \nautomatically activate, in this particular example, a camera to focus \nitself on the direction of the triggered sensor rather than relying on \na DHS employee wasting time trying to find the right spot and focus the \ncamera.\n\n  Another example would be to require the sensing equipment on an \nunmanned aerial vehicle be fully integrated with the systems used by \nDHS personnel on the ground so the images and the data are sent \nautomatically to multiple ground stations. We have seen in the past \nwhere DHS has unsuccessfully exercised its discretion to implement and \nintegrate an automated program as evidenced by the report from GAO and \nalso the inspector general's report. That is why this amendment is \ngoing to be necessary to enhance what the Judiciary Committee has \nalready done.\n  Later on I will offer amendment 3221. This amendment is going to \naddress the problem we have now, which is absolutely inexplicable and \ninexcusable at what our border people are forced to do. They arrest \nsomeone who has illegally come into this country. They arrest them and \nthen release them. Not back in their country of origin; they release \nthem in America. And then guess who doesn't show up when their \nimmigration hearing is called. It defies common sense. This catch-and-\nrelease program we have now is not effective or efficient. It is \nbewildering. In some areas of the border, up to 90 percent of the \ncaptured aliens are released after being caught by DHS. Of course, of \nthose 90 percent who are released, only 10 percent appear for their \nsubsequent immigration court hearings. That is simply not acceptable.\n  How are we going to remedy this? The Judiciary Committee bill started \nthe process. What they are offering is to build some new facilities or \ndetention facilities. The committee does not build enough. What I am \nsuggesting is we build facilities with an additional 20,000 detention \nbeds over and above what the committee is recommending so we can begin \nto get control, get our arms around this immigration system. If it is \nnot possible for DHS to secure\n\n[[Page S2766]]\n\nfurther detention space quickly enough, this amendment, which I will \noffer, will require DHS to examine other secure alternatives to \ndetention.\n  This amendment will also ensure that there are no questions on \nwhether detention facilities are safe, if they are clean, if they are \nsecure, and if they are consistent with DHS policies and consistent \nwith America's tradition of providing secure, safe, clean facilities to \npeople fleeing persecution from other countries.\n  I will offer two commonsense amendments that my colleagues will \naccept. Clearly, it is intended as an enhancement to improve the \ncommittee bill. Hopefully then we can come out with a good work product \nand address this immigration chaos we have in this country at this \nmoment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, in this debate on immigration reform, \nthere are three basic goals I have in mind. No. 1, and foremost, I want \nus to seal our borders. I wish to see us identify the illegal aliens we \nhave in this country. We don't know for sure how many are in this \ncountry. We hear a lot of numbers thrown out. Originally it was 8 to 10 \nmillion and now it seems the common number being thrown around is 11 \nmillion. But when you get right down to it, nobody knows how many \nillegal immigrants we have in this country. We need to identify those \nindividuals to help reach some reasonable conclusions.\n  The third goal is to do it in a manner that does not disrupt our \neconomy.\n  And, finally, I don't believe we should have amnesty.\n  I have a couple of amendments I am going to be presenting to the \nSenate. The first amendment is an attempt to put together a plan. We \ndirect the agencies to come together with a plan on how they are going \nto manage immigration, both from a diplomatic point of view as well as \nfrom a border immigration point of view. That particular amendment I \nhope will be accepted as a managers' amendment. I don't expect it to be \ncontroversial.\n  The other amendment I will talk about this morning I hope to call up \nlater today for a vote. That is amendment numbered 3216. I will not \ncall it up this morning, but I will debate it in the Senate and \ndescribe the amendment as to what it does.\n  I rise today to share with my colleagues six words I believe will be \nas surprising to others as to me. Those words are ``advocacy of \nterrorism not always exclusionary.''\n  Am I reading these from a terrorist handbook? No. Am I reading them \nfrom the United States law passed by the Congress and signed by the \nPresident? Most certainly not. Am I reading it from a how-to book on \nexploiting loopholes in the United States visa system? I may as well \nbe.\n  Colleagues, believe it or not, I am reading from our very own \nDepartment of State Foreign Affairs Manual. The same Foreign Affairs \nManual issued to the Department's 25,000 employees located in more than \n250 posts worldwide. Even more alarming, this is from the chapter that \ninstructs our consular officers to whom visas should be issued.\n  Visas are, of course, the ticket foreigners, including terrorists, \nneed to enter the United States. This instruction says to the consular \nofficer deciding whether to issue a visa that they need not deny a visa \nto an individual who advocates terrorism. I, for one, cannot imagine a \nmore pertinent ground for denial. If advocacy of terrorism is not \ngrounds for exclusion, then I don't know what is.\n  Not only am I concerned about the message this sends to our dedicated \nconsular officers, I am just as concerned about the message this sends \nto terrorists. It says to them, feel free to lay the groundwork for an \nattack at home, apply for a visa, and come to America to finish the \njob. This is not the message the United States should be conveying to \nterrorists. This Congress has already passed important legislation \ndenying visas to terrorists, including in the PATRIOT and REAL ID Acts. \nThe REAL ID Act, signed into law on May 11, 2005, specifically states \none who endorses or espouses terrorist activity is inadmissible. The \nREAL ID Act became public law on May 11 of last year, 8 days after \npublication of this manual. Yet today, more than 10 months later, the \nState Department is still instructing its consular offices that \nadvocacy of terrorism may not be a ground for exclusion.\n\n  Certainly, the State Department needs to send a message that we in \nCongress are serious about securing our borders and particularly \nserious about preventing known advocates of terrorism, people who are \nmost likely to wish harm to our country, from entering into the United \nStates. Admittance to the United States is a privilege; it is not a \nright. My amendment says if you advocate terrorism, you lose the \nprivilege of coming to the United States, recognizing, of course, that \nspecial circumstances under which someone who meets these criteria may \nnonetheless need to be admitted. My amendment does nothing to change \nthe authority of the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security in \nconsultation with the Attorney General to waive an individual's \ninadmissibility when they deem it in the interest of the United States.\n  I will urge my colleagues to join me in voting for this amendment \nthat slams the door shut on the face of advocates of terrorism who seek \nto cross the borders into our country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, from the district I had the honor of \nrepresenting over 13 years in the House of Representatives, one can see \nthe Statue of Liberty. Ellis Island is a place that has been the \ngateway to opportunity for millions of new Americans. For me, it is a \nshining example of the power of the American dream, a place that \nlaunched millions down their own road to success.\n  Like millions of Americans, my own parents came to this country \nfleeing tyranny in Cuba and searching for freedom. Because of this \ndebate we continue today, this has a special and personal interest to \nme.\n  America has a proud tradition as a nation of immigrants and a nation \nof laws. Unfortunately, our current immigration law and systems are \nbroken and have failed us. We need tough, smart, and comprehensive \nimmigration reform that reflects current economic and social realities, \nthat respects the core values of family unity and fundamental fairness, \nand that upholds our tradition as a nation of immigrants.\n  We need to aggressively curtail crossings at the border. We need \ntough border security and enforcement measures that prevent \nundocumented immigration so our immigration system is safe, legal, \norderly, and fair to all.\n  Our goal should be neither open borders nor closed borders but smart \nborders. In a post-September 11 world, our efforts must be tough and \nswift to ensure the borders of the United States are controlled. \nUnfortunately, that is not the case right now. We have all heard about \nand seen what is happening along our borders. Crimes are up in our \nborder communities and overpowering local law enforcement's ability to \naddress these challenges.\n  So-called ``coyotes'' or human smugglers charge thousands to bring \npeople into this country illegally. Because of this, organized criminal \norganizations have entered the business of trafficking humans into the \nUnited States. In fact, there are reports there is more money in \nsmuggling undocumented aliens into our Nation than smuggling drugs. \nThat is why the first step of any immigration reform proposal must be \nto secure our lax and broken immigration system.\n  Our porous and dangerous border and uneven enforcement of our \nNation's current laws are significant security risks. Immigration \nreform is needed to protect America and restore the rule of law.\n  It is unbelievable, however, under the nature of that reality that \nwhen we look at the Clinton administration in 1999, 417 businesses were \ncited for undocumented immigration violations. If we look at the Bush \nadministration in 2004, only three employers were issued notices by the \nBush administration. That is why I support stronger immigration \nenforcement, not only at our borders but at our workplaces as well.\n  We must take full command of both human capital and technology to \ntruly secure the borders. This can be done by stronger screening at our \nconsulates and ports of entry, better use of technology, such as \nunmanned aerial vehicles along our borders, and ensuring that our \nborder agencies have both the\n\n[[Page S2767]]\n\nnecessary staff and the resources to do their jobs.\n  Time and time again, we in Congress have passed many of these \nprovisions into law. The question is not whether we will pass them \nagain but whether we will actually provide the funding to make these \nsecurity improvements a reality.\n  Over a year and 3 months ago, President Bush signed into law the \nIntelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act.\n  I was one of the conferees on that bill. I would remind our \ncolleagues that it contained over 40 sections and 100 pages of \nimmigration-related provisions. These tough but smart, new measures \nincluded, among others, adding thousands of additional Border Patrol \nagents, Immigration and Customs investigators, detention beds, and \ncriminalizing the smuggling of immigrants, just as the 9/11 Commission \nrecommended.\n  Now, I am sure the American people assume that their Government not \nonly implemented but also fully funded these tough measures to secure \nour borders and ensure our Nation's safety. Unfortunately, the \nPresident and this Congress have chosen not to do so. In fact, as part \nof the fiscal year 2006 appropriations process, Congress has only \nfunded 1,500 of the 2,000 new Border Patrol agents called for this year \nby that law, less than half of the 800 immigration enforcement \ninvestigators, less than half of the 8,000 additional detention beds \nrequired. So much for being tough and for fully funding what has \nalready been passed and called for.\n  While the Senate must be tough and smart in the legislation it \npasses, I do not want it to be mean-spirited. I was still a Member of \nthe House of Representatives last December when that body considered \nthe Sensenbrenner bill, H.R. 4437. Beyond the heated rhetoric that \nexisted during the debate on that legislation, the bill itself was \nshortsighted and even mean-spirited.\n  Since it makes a felon out of anyone who is here in an undocumented \nstatus, it would require the most massive roundup and deportation of \npeople in the history of the world. I believe that is both highly \nunlikely and impractical on many levels, including due to both the \nbudgetary and economic impact on our Nation and its economy.\n  That bill would also criminalize citizens of the United States. Under \nthe guise of a much broader definition of smuggling, that bill could \nallow the Government to prosecute almost any American who has regular \ncontact with undocumented immigrants.\n  Under the Sensenbrenner bill, an American citizen who helps an \nundocumented alien under any of these circumstances would be found \nguilty:\n  A rape crisis counselor who is assisting a woman who has been raped \nwould be guilty of a crime for ``assisting''; the church group that \nprovides food aid, shelter, or other assistance to members of its \ncommunity would be guilty of a crime for ``assisting or encouraging''; \nan aid worker who finds an illegal entrant suffering from dehydration \nin the desert and drives that person to a hospital would be guilty of a \ncrime for ``transporting''; a counselor who assists a victim of \ndomestic violence and her children would be guilty of a crime for \n``assisting or encouraging''; Catholic Charities or other faith-based \ngroups or lawyers who give advice on immigration procedures would be \nguilty of a crime.\n  I don't believe any of those provisions are the Christian values we \nso often hear talked about on the Senate floor. Because of those very \ntroubling provisions, I certainly could not vote for that legislation. \nIn doing so, I hoped that the Senate would work not as Democrats or \nRepublicans but as Americans to bring our policies in line with our \nNation's ideals and values.\n  History is replete with examples of the United States of America \nbeing a welcoming nation. But, unfortunately, the public dialog through \nthe years has been less than welcoming. Over the decades, the influx of \nimmigrants of various ethnicities has caused concerns and in many cases \nheated comments against such immigrants to our Nation. In some cases, \nthere were even laws enacted to limit or ban certain ethnicities from \nbeing able to come to the land of opportunity.\n  Before the American revolution, Founding Father Benjamin Franklin \nwrote of the influx of German immigrants to Philadelphia. He said:\n\n       Those who come hither are generally the most stupid of \n     their own nation.\n\n  Henry Gardner, the Governor of Massachusetts, in the middle of the \n19th century, saw the Irish as a ``horde of foreign barbarians.''\n  Finally, a 1925 report of the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce stated \nthat Mexicans are suitable for agricultural work ``due to their \ncrouching and bending habits . . . , while the white is physically \nunable to adapt himself to them.''\n  We should not stand for rhetoric that focuses solely on the weak and \nsays nothing about those who benefit the most from immigrants' \ncontributions--the corporations and, ultimately, all of us, the \nconsumers of these goods and services. Let's face it, we are all a part \nof the equation that contributes to this unfortunate situation in which \nwe currently find ourselves--the fortunate among us in our country who \nhave nannies to care for our children, maids to clean our hotels, \nmotels, and even our homes, landscapers who maintain our lawns, and so \nmany others who make a difference in our daily lives. Yet they seem to \nbe invisible to us. Yet they, too, those who employ them, are part of \nthe problem as well.\n  It does not end with the rhetoric. There has been a concerted effort \nover the past few years, through piecemeal proposals, to make our civil \nservants do things they do not even have the proper training to do. \nThese efforts have included anything from trying to make our caregivers \nand doctors into police officers and our school teachers into INS and \nborder security agents.\n  Changes to our immigration system cannot be done in a patchwork \napproach. They need to be undertaken in a comprehensive manner that can \nprovide us with a safe and orderly immigration system that preserves \nfamily values, rewards hard work and sacrifice, and is in the national \ninterest and benefits all Americans.\n  Now, let me be clear. I am first and foremost for hiring any American \nwho is willing to do any job that is available in this country, any \nAmerican who wants to do the backbreaking work that is so needed in our \nagricultural sector, to clean the bathrooms in our hotels on their \nhands and knees, and to do the work in our meat-packing plants across \nour Nation. These are done largely by immigrants. They should be \navailable to any American who wants to do it first.\n  But many of us know all too well this is not the case. Like my \nparents--and I am sure many others here--immigrants have not come to \nthis country to be taken care of. They have come to work hard--very \nhard--to provide for their families, and all they want is a better life \nfor their children.\n  It is in the national interest to have all those here seeking the \nAmerican dream to be able to fully participate and contribute to \nAmerican society. Those who bend their back every day picking the \nfruits and vegetables that end up on our kitchen tables are part of \nAmerica. Those who, through the sweat of their labor, dig the ditches \nthat lay the infrastructure for the future are part of America. Those \nwho are on their knees cleaning the hotel and motel rooms for our \ntravelers are part of America. Those who plucked the chicken or deboned \nthe meat we had for dinner last night are part of America. And those \nwhose steady hands and warm hearts help the aged, the sick, and \ndisabled meet their daily needs are part of America.\n  These men and women who, through hard work and sacrifice, are seeking \nthe American dream need to be brought out of the darkness and into the \nlight of America's promise. It is in the national security interest of \nthe United States to know who is here to seek the American dream versus \nwho is here to destroy it.\n  That is why I support the comprehensive immigration reform proposal \nthat was reported out of the Senate Judiciary Committee in a bipartisan \nmanner. It is perfect? No. But it is tough, smart, and balanced, unlike \neither the Sensenbrenner bill or the bill offered by the majority \nleader.\n  The Judiciary-reported bill will enforce our laws, protect our \nnational and homeland security, while also reflecting current economic \nrealities and respecting the core values of family\n\n[[Page S2768]]\n\nunity and fundamental fairness. It secures our borders through the \nincreased use of aerial vehicles and sensors, while increasing the \nnumber of Border Patrol agents and immigration enforcement \ninvestigators. The Judiciary Committee bill has very strong border \nsecurity and enforcement provisions that go even beyond the bill \noffered by the majority leader. For example, it makes tunneling under \nour borders a Federal crime, adds new criminal penalties for evading \nimmigration officers, makes manslaughter an aggravated felony, and adds \n12,000 new Border Patrol agents over the next 5 years. This bill \nprovides a way for future workers to safely migrate to the United \nStates in a legal process, works with labor and worker protections, and \naddresses the family backlog so that families can be reunited.\n  The Judiciary Committee legislation would also allow the possibility \nfor temporary guest worker permits. Those who try to portray the bill \nas amnesty are, I believe, moving us in a direction to seek to, in \nessence, express the sense of fear. In fact, the Judiciary Committee \nlegislation would punish those who are here in an undocumented status \nby requiring them to meet all of the following requirements before they \ncan even join the path toward earned legalization. They would have to \npay a couple thousand dollars in fines and fees. They would have to \npass a criminal background check. They would have to go to the back of \nthe line behind all applicants waiting for green cards. They would have \nto pay any and all back taxes. They would have to remain continuously \nemployed going forward. They would have to pass a medical exam, and, \nyes, they would have to learn English and learn U.S. history and \ngovernment.\n  So as Senator Graham stated, this is an 11-year path--an 11-year \npath--to earned citizenship, not amnesty.\n  There is a broad and diverse coalition supporting the comprehensive \nimmigration reform in the Judiciary bill. This unusual coalition \nincludes individuals and organizations from our business, civic, civil \nrights, faith, immigrant, and labor communities.\n  So in closing, let me commend Senators Specter, Leahy, Kennedy, \nGraham, and all the Senators on the Judiciary Committee for the work \nthey did in producing a bill that moves us much closer to once again \ncontrolling our borders, while upholding our tradition as a nation of \nimmigrants and laws.\n  However we got here, from wherever we came, we know that we are now \nin the same boat together as Americans. And together, hopefully, this \nSenate will act to make this journey a safe, orderly, and legal process \nthat preserves and fulfills that American dream for all.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the crucial \nissue we are addressing as a nation and as a U.S. Senate, this \nimmigration question.\n  I continue to have grave concerns about many of the provisions that \nare now before us. I am going to talk about some of those general \nconcerns, and then I am going to outline two specific amendments I will \nbe offering on the floor of the Senate that help meet them.\n  It is often said that Americans have a very poor sense of history; we \ndo not read history much; we do not remember past mistakes and past \nlessons; we don't learn from history. I am afraid much of the debate \nand activity on this question on the floor of the Senate is another \nexample of that because we went through very much the same sort of \ndebate in 1986, the last time the Congress addressed illegal \nimmigration in a major way and passed a more limited amnesty program.\n  It is instructive to look back and read those debates. It is \nenormously instructive to understand the arguments pro and con, during \nthat debate in this very Chamber. And if one does that, one gets an \neerie sense of history repeating itself. Unfortunately, it is a history \nof mistakes and missed opportunities which only made the problem worse. \nI encourage all of my Senate colleagues to go back to those debates, to \nread those words and statements and the arguments pro or con to get a \nsense of that history.\n  In terms of supporters' arguments for the legislation in 1986, many \nof exactly the same arguments were made. If we deal with this problem \none time, if we create this program and deal with then 3 million \nillegal workers and immigrants in this country, we can solve it once \nand for all, and then we will have a true enforcement mechanism that \nwill never let the problem recur or grow again--an interesting set of \narguments, the same arguments we are hearing now.\n  What has happened since 1986? On that, the history and the record \nshould be crystal clear. We didn't solve the problem back then. We \npassed major legislation which included an amnesty program, and the \nproblem grew by 400 or 500 percent, a problem that was maybe 3 million \nillegal workers in our country back then. Even after so many of them \nwere granted amnesty and given legal status, what do we face now? We \nface 12 million, perhaps more, illegal immigrants in this country.\n  What is the simple lesson of that bit of history? The simple lesson \nis that we never got real with border security. We never got real with \nenforcement. And perhaps the most important lesson--that anything akin \nto an amnesty program is going to encourage a lot more of that illegal \nactivity which we are still not fully prepared to deal with on our \nborders.\n  The simple but basic conclusion I reached from that important history \nis that we need to address border security and enforcement first. We \nneed to get real and prove ourselves on that side of the equation first \nbecause we have never effectively addressed that in the past, including \n1986.\n  My plea to all of my colleagues is that we address this major issue \nin a simple two-step approach. First, let's do what there is wide \nconsensus on, let's pass important border security provisions. Let's \npass important and vital enforcement provisions, including those which \ngo directly at employers who break our law by hiring illegals. And \nlet's prove to ourselves and our constituents that this can and will be \ndone.\n  Talk is cheap. And if it is cheap anywhere, perhaps it is cheapest, \nquite frankly, in the Congress. We talk a good game about this issue. \nWe talk about enforcement in the context of this debate. But the simple \nfact is that we have never proven ourselves on the issues of \nenforcement and border security.\n  Talk is cheap. When we talk about authorization language, we all know \nauthorization language is one thing, but appropriating the money to \nhave true border security and true enforcement is quite a different and \nmore challenging step. So let's not just talk. Let's act and let's \nprove ourselves. Let's do that before we run headlong into other \nprovisions that are being debated, such as provisions that would be \ntantamount to amnesty.\n  I will offer two amendments--one a broad global amendment and one a \nmuch more focused amendment--that are both consistent with this general \nphilosophy that talk is cheap and that we need to act and prove \nourselves with regard to border security and enforcement before we run \nheadlong into these other issues.\n  My first amendment is No. 3264. It does several essential things with \nregard to the Specter substitute No. 3192 currently before the Senate. \nIt would strike what is often called the temporary worker program in \nthe Specter substitute. It would also strike the title VI amnesty \nprogram in the Specter substitute. It would direct different elements \nof our Government to study important issues that have come up in the \ndebate so we have a fuller sense of the implications of what some would \nrush headlong into.\n  Specifically, it would direct three studies to be done within 1 year \nof enactment of this bill. First, the Department of Labor would study \nthe need for guest workers on a sector-by-sector basis and the impact \nof any proposed temporary worker program on wages and employment \nopportunities available to American workers. Clearly, in\n\n[[Page S2769]]\n\nthis country there are needs in our economy that are not adequately \nbeing met by American citizen workers. But just as clearly, opening \nourselves full throttle with a very broad amnesty program or a very \nbroad temporary worker program that would grow automatically over time \nhas the risk of bringing down wages and opportunities for American \nworkers. We need a much more careful and precise examination by some \nentity such as the Department of Labor on a sector-by-sector basis as \nto what the consequences of this would likely be.\n  Secondly, my amendment would propose a GAO study establishing minimum \ncriteria for effectively implementing a temporary worker program and \ndetermining whether the Department of Homeland Security has the \ncapability to enforce such a program. If GAO determines that Homeland \nSecurity does not effectively have that capability right now, then they \nshould determine what additional manpower and resources would be \nrequired to ensure effective implementation.\n\n  Again, some on this floor are proposing a mammoth change to our \nimmigration policy--a new temporary worker program--without our having \na precise idea of what manpower and other authorities Homeland Security \nneeds to implement and enforce such a program. We need to know that on \nthe front end. We need to have that in place on the front end before we \nrush headlong into any temporary worker program.\n  The third study my amendment would mandate is a Department of \nHomeland Security study to determine whether border security and \ninterior enforcement measures enacted as part of this act are being \nproperly implemented and whether they are effective in securing U.S. \nborders and curbing illegal immigration. We often talk a good game in \nterms of border security. We often talk a good game in terms of \nenforcing the laws presently on the books in the interior of the \ncountry. But we need a much more precise sense of what it will really \ntake to bring enforcement to all of those provisions--proper, full \nimplementation. We need to hear from DHS in a lot more detail about \nwhat they will need--manpower, authority--to actually implement and \nmake this work before we rush headlong into temporary worker, amnesty, \nand other provisions.\n  I will offer a second amendment on the floor. That will be No. 3265. \nThat is a much more focused micro-amendment. The first amendment I \ndescribed is a broad amendment to meet the major objections I have with \nthe Specter substitute. The second amendment is much more narrow. It \nspecifically addresses the following issue: Right now, the Specter bill \nrequires that illegal aliens prove they have been employed since \nJanuary 7, 2004, in order to take the next steps toward citizenship.\n  How does one prove that? Well, they can show IRS records. That is one \npossibility. They can show Social Security records--that is another--or \nother records maintained by Federal, State, or local governments. Their \nemployer can attest that they have been working. That is yet another \npossibility, although one has to wonder how often that is going to \nhappen since we are talking for the most part about illegal workers. \nTheir labor union, daycare center, and other organizations can attest \nthat they have been dealing with these people inside the country since \nat least January 7, 2004. But that is not the only thing they can \nproduce.\n  If all else fails, they can do the following: They can have a \nnonrelative sign an affidavit, an attestation, that they have been in \nthis country since January 7, 2004. Anyone who is not blood-related to \nthem may do so. Clearly, this is an open-ended invitation to fraud and \nabuse. Clearly, having such an affidavit as a possibility with no \nsupporting documentation, with no testimony from any Federal Government \nagency or State government or local government agency is a wide-open \ninvitation for abuse. So my second amendment will simply close this \ndoor to fraud and strike the sworn affidavit or attestation provision \nin the language currently on the floor.\n  I urge all of our colleagues to look carefully at these two \namendments. More broadly speaking, I urge my colleagues to think long \nand hard about the lessons of history with regard to this particular \nissue. We have history to study. Let's not ignore it. Let's not ignore \nthose lessons and plunge headlong into repeating the mistakes of \nhistory, particularly those of Congress's action in 1986, because the \nonly difference in so many of the provisions now before us from those \nin 1986 is that this would be on a far broader and grander scale, the \nproblem having at least quadrupled since those mistakes of 1986.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to support the Judiciary \nCommittee's superb product, the immigration reform, border security \nbill. I also wish to speak on an amendment Senator Brownback and I \nintend to offer. I gather we are not offering amendments now, but this \nis an opportunity to speak on this amendment. This would address \nAmerica's treatment of people who come here seeking asylum.\n  I am pleased to be working with Senator Brownback. Over the years, my \ncolleague from Kansas has done so much good work to protect the rights \nof refugees overseas and those who seek asylum on our shores for a host \nof reasons--that they might escape persecution for reasons of faith or \npolitics. Senator Brownback is a partner I am truly proud to be working \nwith on this matter.\n  This amendment rises out of a report that was issued in February of \nlast year by the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom. It \nis a Commission established by law, by act of Congress. One of its \nduties is to issue annual and often more frequent reports. This report \nlast February raised very serious concerns, objections about \ninsufficient protections for asylum seekers arriving in this country. \nThe Commission reported an unacceptable risk that genuine asylum \nseekers were being turned away because their fears and the real dangers \nof being returned to their home countries were not fully considered. \nThe Commission also found that while asylum seekers are having their \napplications considered, they are often detained for months in maximum-\nsecurity prisons without ever having had a chance before an immigration \njudge to request release on bond.\n  The Commission described conditions of detention that are completely \nunacceptable for a just nation to impose on people who are trying to \nescape war, oppression, religious persecution, even torture.\n  The amendment I am honored to be offering with Senator Brownback will \nimplement the Commission's most important recommendations. It calls for \nsensible reforms that will safeguard the Nation's security, improve the \nefficiency of our immigration detention system, and ensure that people \nfleeing persecution are treated in accordance with this Nation's most \nbasic values. Remember, our purpose was stated in the original American \ndocument, the Declaration of Independence, which said that the \nGovernment was being formed to secure the rights to life, liberty, and \nthe pursuit of happiness which were the endowment of our Creator, not \njust to every American but to every child of God. this Nation has been, \nover the decades, a land of refuge where people seek freedom and \nsanctuary from the deprivations they endured in the countries they were \nin. It is our attempt in this amendment to revitalize and make more \ncredible and honest and true the asylum process that our country has to \nimplement those ideals.\n\n  The amendment we are introducing would implement quality assurance \nprocedures to ensure that Government employees carefully and accurately \nrecord the statements of people who say they have a fear of returning \nto their countries. Aliens not subject to mandatory detention would be \nentitled to a hearing--basic American due process--to determine whether \nthey could be released. Providing bond hearings for low-risk aliens \nwill also free up space for the cases that really ought to be \nincarcerated.\n  The amendment also promotes secure alternatives to detention of the \ntype that the Department of Homeland Security, I am pleased to say, has \nalready begun to implement. These new programs and procedures would \nalso make our use of detention space more effective and efficient at an \naverage cost of $90 per person per day. But, of course,\n\n[[Page S2770]]\n\nthat is the average. Often it is much higher. Detention beds have \nalways been scarce.\n  Provisions in the legislation before us--the Judiciary Committee \nproposal--would vastly increase the number of aliens being held in \ndetention. The underlying bill, which I strongly support, is a tough \nbill. It is so tough that it will inevitably increase the number of \npeople who are not in legal status who will be held in detention. Our \nimmigration system will need to prioritize available space because it \nis limited for aliens who pose a risk of flight, a threat to public \nsafety, or are otherwise subject by law to mandatory detention.\n  For those who may remain detained, we are obliged as a just society \nto provide humane conditions at immigration facilities and jails used \nby the Department of Homeland Security.\n  The amendment we are introducing includes modest requirements to \nensure decent conditions, consistent with our best American values, \nespecially for asylum seekers, families with children, and other \nvulnerable populations. It requires improvements in areas such as \naccess to medical care and limitations on the use of solitary \nconfinement. It creates a more effective system within the Department \nof Homeland Security for seeing and inspecting these facilities.\n  The United States has been, is, and hopefully always will be a land \nof refuge for those seeking liberty. Many of our Nation's Founders, of \ncourse, fled here themselves to escape persecution for their political \nopinions, their religious beliefs, or even their ethnicity. Since that \ntime, the United States has honored its history and its founding values \nby standing against persecution around the world, offering refuge to \nthose who flee from oppression and welcoming them as contributors to \nAmerican society.\n  That brings me now briefly to the larger immigration debate before us \nthis week. I want to start with a bit of history. It was in March of \n1790 that the first Congress of the United States began debating an \nimmigration and naturalization act that would spell out how new \narrivals could become citizens of our new Nation. The main requirement \nof the law finally approved was that an immigrant needed to live in the \nUnited States for 2 years and in the State in which he settled for 1 \nyear to attain legal status. The Senator from Pennsylvania at the time, \nMr. William Maclay, thought immigration would be such a benefit to the \nnew Nation that he wanted those residency requirements removed. Senator \nOliver Ellsworth of Connecticut, who I believe occupied the seat in the \nSenate that I am honored to occupy now in the succession, wanted the \nresidency requirement kept in. Senator Maclay of Pennsylvania lost the \ndebate and, frustrated, wrote in his diary afterward:\n\n       We Pennsylvanians act as if we believe that God made of one \n     blood all families of the earth. But the Eastern people----\n\n  Parenthetically, he must have been referring to us nutmakers from \nConnecticut----\n\n     seem to think that he made none but New England folks.\n\n  I am sure Senator Ellsworth would have objected to that diary entry \non behalf of himself and the people of Connecticut.\n  Today, this Senator from Connecticut is proud to stand with one of \nthe two Senators from Pennsylvania today, the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, Senator Specter, and my fellow New Englander, ranking member \nof the Judiciary Committee, Senator Leahy, in supporting the balanced, \nstrong, practical, progressive immigration reforms that they have \nreported out of the Judiciary Committee.\n  I thank them and congratulate them on this balanced and bipartisan \nbill. I also give special tribute to Senators Kennedy and McCain for \nall of the work they did in introducing their initial legislation, \nwhich I was proud to be an original cosponsor of, much of which has now \nbeen embraced in the Judiciary Committee bill.\n  The proposed legislation before us, the underlying bill, would \nenhance our national security, promote our economic well-being, and \ncreate a fair and just path to citizenship for those who come here to \nwork hard, pay their taxes, respect the law, and learn the English \nlanguage.\n  We all agree we have to do more to secure our borders and control \nillegal immigration. What we are doing now simply doesn't work. This \ndebate has to be about practical solutions, about fixing that problem. \nThat means we will never fix our broken borders without fixing our \nbroken immigration system, in my opinion.\n  People talk about this as a choice between better border security and \nimmigration reform. That is a false choice. Not only do we need both, \nunless we have both we will not achieve either better border security \nor the practical immigration reform we need.\n  The bill reported out of the Judiciary Committee contains all of the \nessential security and enforcement provisions in the bill introduced by \nthe majority leader. Both bills substantially increase Border Patrol \nand immigration enforcement personnel, detention beds, border fences, \nresources for border security systems and technologies. Both bills \ncreate new criminal penalties or make existing penalties more severe. \nBoth bills establish new mandates and authorities for detaining and \ndeporting aliens.\n  However, the Judiciary Committee bill omits a couple of parts of the \nmajority leader's bill which ought to be omitted--those that \ncriminalize the so-called Good Samaritan behavior toward undocumented \nimmigrants and those who would criminalize the undocumented immigrants \nthat we have. To me, that is foolish; it will not work. In fact, it \nwill push the undocumented immigrants further into the shadows because \nnow their status is not only a violation of immigration law but it \nwould be a crime. It would subject them to much greater exploitation by \nemployers in this country and, in that sense, constitute increasingly \ndifficult competition for Americans who want to work. But overall, this \nbill on border security contains all of the provisions, except those \ntwo, in the majority leader's proposal to toughen border security.\n\n  I think history should have told us something--that as important as \ntough border security measures are, they are not going to solve the \nproblem of illegal immigration because people want so desperately to \ncome here. I have said before, and I will say it again: With very few \nexceptions, the 11 million undocumented immigrants that we have in the \ncountry today came to America for the same reasons my grandparents did. \nBut my grandparents arrived at Ellis Island and they were let in. Why \ndid the undocumented come then and today? For freedom, for opportunity, \nfor a better life for their children--to be Americans. Think about it: \nfreedom, opportunity, and a better life for our children, which are \nAmerican values and the American dream.\n  I think history has shown us that border security ought to be \ntoughened, but it is not going to stop this flow. Let me cite this \nstatistic for you to prove it. In recent times, from 1993 to 2004, the \nnumber of Border Patrol agents was tripled because of concerns about \nillegal immigration. Spending on border enforcement quadrupled. We have \n10,835 Border Patrol agents and almost $4 billion a year is spent--\nquadrupled on border enforcement. What happened to the number of \nundocumented immigrants in that time? It has doubled, from 4.5 million \nto 9.3 million. The reason, obviously, is that as long as we fail to \nprovide legal channels to these people who desperately want to come to \nthis country, they are going to find some way to come here illegally. \nThey are going to come here to work.\n  You have all seen the Pew Charitable Trust studies that show that 95 \npercent of the working-age men who are undocumented immigrants have \nfull-time, year-round jobs. In fact, they make up 5 percent of the \nAmerican workforce overall.\n  So the reforms this bill adopts, creating a path to earn citizenship, \nnot only is the right thing to do for our economy, but it is consistent \nwith our values. It is also the most practical thing to do to deal with \nthe problem of illegal immigration and border security and, as others \nhave said, would free up resources at the border to stop the few coming \nover who come in for bad reasons. Particularly, I focus on potential \nterrorists and those who want to deal in controlled substances, drugs, \nin this country.\n  I will wrap up now because I see my friend and colleague and \nsupporter of\n\n[[Page S2771]]\n\nthis legislation, the Senator from Colorado, on the floor. I support it \nstrongly. I think we have an extraordinary opportunity in this Senate \nto do something right this week, and to do something practical to fix \nthe immigration crisis in our country. The immigration system is not \nworking now and this bill gives you an opportunity to make it work. I \nknow there has been discussion of possible compromises. I think the \nJudiciary Committee bill itself is a compromise, and a good strong one. \nAlthough the particular compromises that have been floated in the last \n24 hours I don't accept, I am encouraged by them because they speak to \nmomentum in favor of coming together across party lines, regional \nlines--every line you could imagine--as Americans, to do what is right \nand practical, and to assist our security and our economy.\n  I close with a wonderful quote I found from Thomas Jefferson going \nback to the initial days of immigration when he said:\n\n       Born in other countries, yet believing you could be happy \n     in this, our laws acknowledge, as they should, your right to \n     join us in society.\n\n  It is that spirit Jefferson articulated right at the beginning of the \nAmerican experience that I think challenges us, informs, and elevates \nthe proposal before us. We have a real opportunity to act on that ideal \nthis week. I can't help but go back to what that wise Senator from \nPennsylvania once said: God, in fact, made all the families of Earth of \none blood.\n  I yield the floor and thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, at the outset, I recognize my friend from \nConnecticut and agree with his comments and applaud his voice of \nmoderation and centrist views. Those are the kinds of views that are \nbringing together the coalition that ultimately will allow us to \nsucceed in passing comprehensive immigration reform in the Senate.\n  I want to speak about two issues today. One is about the law and \norder aspects of this bill, and the second is to refer to the nature of \nthis debate we are seeing around the country on immigration.\n  The first point I want to make is that the Judiciary Committee bill \nwhich was produced with great work on the part of both Democrats and \nRepublicans is, in fact, a law and order bill. For those people who \nhave said it is not, they are wrong. This is a law and order bill \nbecause what it does is it takes the immigration issues we are facing \nin this country and addresses the strengthening of our borders. It also \naddresses the enforcement of our immigration laws within the interior \nof the United States. And finally, it applies penalties and \nregistration to those who are here illegally in our country. So I \nbelieve the appropriate characterization we should be giving this \nlegislation is that it is a law and order bill.\n  I want to review some of the aspects of border security which are \nvery important. All of us know that today we are involved in this \ndebate because we have broken borders, both to the South and to the \nNorth. It is not just the border between the United States and Mexico \nwe are addressing today, but it also is the border with Canada. It is a \nsystem of broken borders we have in this country today.\n  What this legislation does is toughen border security in ways we have \nnot done for the last 20 years. In this post- 9/11 world, it seems to \nme there can be no higher imperative for our Nation's calling than to \nmake sure we are doing everything we can to protect the Nation and \nprotect our homeland. How can we do that if we have porous borders? \nThat is what this legislation, the Judiciary Committee bill, before the \nSenate does. It addresses that issue of border security.\n  It adds 12,000 new Border Patrol agents. These officers will help \ndouble the number of law enforcement officials we have working on the \nborders to make sure we have secure borders.\n  It creates additional border fences in places that are vulnerable, \nwhere we see significant crossings in some of the major cities between \nthe North and the South, but we know with these additional fences in \nvulnerable areas that we can increase border security.\n  It provides new criminal penalties for a whole range of activities, \nincluding the construction of tunnels which have been found in \nCalifornia and other places so that those who are involved in the \nconstruction of the tunnels will be subject to some very heavy criminal \npenalties.\n  It adds new checkpoints and points of entry so we can make sure the \nflow of people from one country to another is, in fact, being checked \nand that we can, in fact, make sure they are legal entrants into our \ncountry.\n  It expands the security system at all land borders as well as our \nairports.\n  One of the law and order legs of this stool is the fact that we will \nhave much more strengthened border security if we are able to get this \nimmigration reform package through the Senate.\n  The second aspect of this legislation, which I think stands tall for \nlaw and order, is the enforcement of our immigration laws. For far too \nlong we have turned and looked the other way when our immigration laws \nhave been broken.\n  This immigration bill produced by the Judiciary Committee will have \nus look in the right direction. It will have us stand tall and say: We \nare going to enforce our immigration laws.\n  It adds 5,000 new investigators within the interior of this country \nto make sure we are enforcing those immigration laws. That more than \ndoubles the capacity of our interior enforcement with respect to \nimmigration.\n  It establishes 20 new detention facilities so we can process those \nwho are caught here illegally for violation of our immigration laws.\n  It reimburses the States that now have the responsibility, in many \ncases, of apprehending and detaining aliens. This legislation will \nprovide assistance to the States for that detention.\n  It requires a faster deportation process so that once there is \nsomeone who is caught illegally, they are subject to deportation in a \nprompt process.\n  It creates additional criminal penalties for gang members, for money \nlaundering, and for those who are involved in human trafficking. We go \nafter that lawlessness which has been created by the broken borders we \nhave today.\n  It increases document fraud detention and, as the President said, for \npeople who are here under the guest worker program, they will have a \ntamperproof card so we can make sure the fraudulent business that has \nbeen created is something we stop.\n  It expands authority to remove suspected terrorists from the United \nStates.\n  And it is strong in pushing for the employer sanctions which are now \npart of the law and adds some additional employer sanctions.\n  It is a tough immigration law enforcement bill that addresses the \nissues within our interior.\n  The third point I want to make with respect to this bill, which is a \nlaw and order bill, has to do with the fact that we penalize those who \nhave broken the law. Some people have decided they want to call this \nlegislation amnesty legislation. There is nothing that could be further \nfrom the truth. It is a falsehood to say this legislation provides \namnesty.\n  For those who have broken the law, we require them to pay a penalty. \nIt is a substantial monetary fine. We in America who have worked in law \nenforcement know that many Americans, when they break the law, have to \npay some kind of civil penalty. Here the penalty that is proposed for \nthose illegally here today is $1,000. In addition to paying the \npenalty, we require these people to register with the Government. As \nAmerican citizens, none of us are required to register with the \nGovernment. We, in this bill, however, require the undocumented people \nwho are in this country to register with the U.S. Government. So we \nhave penalties and we have registration.\n  There is a whole host of other items included in this part of the \nlegislation that address the 11 million undocumented workers in this \ncountry, including the requirement that they obtain a temporary work \nvisa, that they provide an additional $1,000 penalty, that they pass a \nbackground check and remain crime free while in the United States, that \nthey pay all back taxes, that they learn English, that they learn \nAmerican history and Government, that they pass a medical exam, and \nthat they prove they are continuously employed with a temporary guest \nvisa.\n\n[[Page S2772]]\n\n  When we look at all these requirements, what we are doing is creating \na system where for an 11-year-period these people are going to be \npunished and they are going to go through what I call a purgatory of \ntime. It is an 11-year waiting period before they are eligible to \nobtain citizenship.\n  So this legislation ought to be correctly characterized as \nlegislation that stands up for law and order, that addresses our broken \nborders and the lawlessness that comes from those broken borders.\n  I wish to briefly also address the tenor of the debate in the United \nStates of America with respect to this issue of immigration reform, \nwhich we are debating in Washington, DC, and across our great Nation.\n  I think President Bush had it right when he talked about this issue a \nfew days ago. He said:\n\n       When we conduct this debate, it must be done in a civil \n     way. It must be done in a way that brings dignity to the \n     process. It must be done in a way that doesn't pit one group \n     of people against another. It must be done in a way that \n     recognizes our history.\n\n  That is what President Bush said about the kind of debate we ought to \nbe having in America today on immigration.\n  Yet the reality is that the kind of debate that is going on in some \nplaces in America is a debate that is very vitriolic and is very \npoisonous. It serves to divide our country as opposed to uniting our \ncountry.\n  I myself have been the subject of many of these attacks by telephone \nand e-mails as well, I am sure, as many of my colleagues who are \nworking in the Senate today. Some of those attacks that have been \nlaunched against me have said I should simply go back to Mexico because \nI am a ``spic.'' I resent that because my family founded a great part \nof this country, including the city of Santa Fe, NM, some 400 years \nago. My family has supported this country through war and depression \nand a whole host of different ways.\n  Like all Americans, I believe we are equal and that we should be \ncelebrating the diversity that makes us a strong country. So the kind \nof comments and the kind of poison that sometimes comes from these \ncomments we are getting from around the country, including my own State \nof Colorado, is not helpful for us as we move forward to create \ncomprehensive immigration reform.\n  I have received other kinds of comments such as from someone calling \nfrom my State:\n\n       I am not a racist against Mexicans. I want all minorities \n     kicked out.\n\n  Another one:\n\n       Put all the illegal aliens on trains and deport them out of \n     the country. They come in vans. Railcars would be a step up.\n\n  Those are just a few samples of the thousands of negative messages I \nhave received in my office as we have engaged in this debate.\n  I go back to the President's statement that as we move forward in \nthis debate on this Senate floor and in this country, we should appeal \nto the better angels of people to ensure we can have a civil debate \nabout a very important issue, that goes to the heart of America's \nnational security, that addresses the economic realities that are \naddressed in the package that came out of the Judiciary Committee, and \nthat also addresses the humanity involved in the immigration chaos in \nwhich we find ourselves.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have been advised that amendments are \nnot being accepted at the moment, so I will withhold it until the \nappropriate time. I ask unanimous consent to speak to the amendment so \nthat my colleagues will be apprised of its contents.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, last December, Senator Brownback of Kansas \nand I went to Africa and went to a part of Africa I had never visited \nbefore. It is a part most Americans are not familiar with. It is called \nthe Democratic Republic of Congo. We have known of it throughout \nhistory as the Congo. It is a huge expanse of country, with its capital \nof Kinshasa in the western part of the Democratic Republic of Congo, \nand then in the far eastern regions is a section of the world that has \nbeen hit hard time and again by devastating loss.\n  In the area around Goma, in the eastern part of Congo, a few years \nago they were hit by a volcano that left 2\\1/2\\ feet of lava in this \npoor town, destroying most of the buildings that were there. They have \nbeen victims of disease, of all of the trappings of poverty, which we \nare aware of in the continent of Africa, while at the same time there \nhas been an ongoing war, which has killed so many innocent people. It \nis amazing, the resilience and the courage of the people in east Congo.\n  Senator Brownback and I went there because we had heard that, with \nlittle fanfare in the West, 1,000 people a day were dying in this part \nof the world from all of the different events I have just noted. We \nwent to a hospital in Goma, which is known as the Docs' Hospital, run \nby a Protestant church, in an effort to provide some basic health care \nin the Congo. We met with some amazing doctors who work for the \nGovernment of the Congo.\n  Some of you who are fans of the ``Oprah'' show from Chicago may know \nshe has focused on a problem they are addressing which is known as \nobstetric fistula. This is a terrible injury a woman sustains when she \nis either sexually assaulted or at too young an age goes through a \nprolonged labor before delivering a baby and has problems that can be \nvery devastating to her personally. So many of the women in this region \nof the world come to this hospital in Goma in the hopes of a surgery. \nThere is a very modern surgical suite there financed by the United \nNations but very few doctors. They have one surgeon.\n  I asked the doctor who was there: How many doctors do you have in \nthis region of the world for the people who live here?\n  He said: We have 1 doctor for each 165,000 people. One doctor.\n  I said: How many surgeons?\n  He said: Oh, that is hard.\n  He did a quick calculation, and he said: I believe we have 1 surgeon \nfor every 3 million people who live here. There is 1 surgeon for every \n3 million people.\n  Imagine if we only had one surgeon for the city of Chicago. That is \ncomparable in terms of numbers.\n  I talked to him for a while about this challenge and the fact that \nthere are not nurses and doctors and surgeons necessary to treat these \npoor people. He talked to me about some of the challenges they face, \nnot just the matter of being paid by the Government, if you are lucky--\nno more than $600 a month--but also the lure of the West on these \ndoctors.\n  We need doctors desperately in the United States. I represent a State \nwith rural communities that are anxious to bring in doctors. We are not \nreally that picky when it comes to their national origin. If they are \ncompetent, well-trained doctors, they will take them from anywhere in \nmany of the small towns I represent. My State is not unlike many other \nStates. But what we find here is this situation where our immigration \nlaws are written in a way to attract doctors from those parts of the \nworld most in need of doctors at the present time. So as Africa and \nAsia and other parts of the world deal with the global AIDS epidemic \nand terrible medical problems such as tuberculosis and malaria, the \ndoctors who could successfully treat the people living there are lured \nfrom those low-paying jobs in desperate circumstances, with limited \nmedical facilities, to the very best opportunities in the United \nStates.\n  I thought about that as I flew back from Africa: What is the fair \nthing to\n\n[[Page S2773]]\n\ndo? We need doctors in the United States, that is for sure, but they \ndesperately need them in the developing parts of the world, and we are \nluring these doctors away. We are draining away this medical talent \nfrom a part of the world that needs it the most.\n  I am going to be offering an amendment later on to this immigration \nbill, and the purpose of this amendment is twofold.\n  First, it would require health care professionals and medical and \nnursing students who are applying for legal permanent residency or a \ntemporary visa to attest whether they have committed to return to their \nhome country. I believe that is important because if someone, for \nexample, in Congo has their surgical residency--it costs about \n$50,000--paid for by the Government of the Congo with the understanding \nthat they will stay and serve for a certain number of years, we should \nhonor that contract. I think that Government has gone out of its way to \nprovide the most basic need of every person on Earth--medical care--and \nfor the United States to step in and say: We will ignore that \ncommitment you made to the Government that paid for your education \nbecause we want you to come to the United States I believe is wrong. So \nthis amendment would say that we have to honor those commitments made \nby those who said: For the cost of my education, I will work for a year \nor 2 years or 3 years in the country that paid for it. That is No. 1.\n\n  No. 2, with this amendment, we would allow doctors and nurses who are \nlegal permanent residents to return temporarily to help countries of \ncitizenship or to reside in certain developing countries to work as \nhealth care professionals. What that means, of course, is if you are \nhere in the United States as a legal permanent resident, you can return \nto a country that is desperately in need of doctors without \njeopardizing your right to come back to the United States. So those who \nfeel a special bond with their home country can go in a medical crisis, \nhelp the people, and then come back to the United States without \npenalty.\n  These are two changes which are not massive but are important because \nthey address, first, keeping your word. If you say: I will help the \npeople of this country if you pay for my medical education, you should \nkeep your word, and the United States should not ignore the fact that \nyou have made that promise.\n  Secondly, if you are here in the United States and want to return to \nhelp people in some of the poorest parts of our world, we should say we \nwant you to do that. It is a compassionate decision on your part that \nwe will honor and not penalize you for in terms of your legal residency \nhere in the United States.\n  I believe this amendment addresses two aspects of the problem that \nare important, but as I reflected on it, there is much more to this.\n  Why is it that we bring in so many medical professionals from other \ncountries around the world? The obvious answer is we are not graduating \nenough doctors, we are not graduating enough surgeons, specialists, \nnurses, health care practitioners, to meet the need in the United \nStates. So in addition to keeping an eye on the needs of the world, we \nneed to focus our attention as well on the needs of the United States. \nThat means in the bills that we are considering relating to education \nand scholarships, assistance and encouragement, we need to put in place \nprograms which will help these health care professionals complete their \neducation in the United States.\n  Now, what does that mean? Let me give you one illustration. I was \nborn in East St. Louis, IL. I am very proud of my hometown. It was a \nblue-collar town. It has gone through some extremely tough times. Just \n2 weeks ago, I returned to East St. Louis Senior High School, which is \nsix blocks from where I grew up. We met with students to talk about a \nnumber of things.\n  A group came up to me afterward. These were six male students at East \nSt. Louis Senior High School, and they said: Senator, we want to talk \nto you about our school.\n  I said: Sure. What do you want to talk about?\n  They said: Why is it that at our school in East St. Louis, the \nstudents don't have personal computers, and yet, just up the hill in \nBelleview, they do? Why is it that in our school we don't have the \nequipment in our chemistry lab or our physics lab that we need to \nreally learn these subjects, while in schools just a few miles away \nthey do?\n  The answer is obvious: It is the way we finance education in America. \nThere are school districts that have and school districts that have not \nand, sadly, in many respects, East St. Louis is one of those school \ndistricts that do not have the basics when it comes to some of the \nequipment they need so their students can be well trained.\n  If we are serious about having enough doctors and nurses and health \ncare professionals, we have to be serious about the education we \nprovide for the students across America. I believe we are falling \ndreadfully short.\n  No Child Left Behind tests students across America to find out where \nthey are deficient, where they are falling behind. That is a good \nthing. Kids hate to take tests; I always hated to take a test. But if \nyou can't measure it, you wonder if there is real value. In this \nsituation, a test at least tells you whether a student is progressing. \nEqually important, the tests are divided in schools, so it isn't just \nthe average score you are reading; you will read the score for majority \nstudents, minority students, those who are special education students, \nthose who are taking English as a second language. You may find that \nthe average score is comforting, but when you break out the groups, \nthere are some that need extra attention, extra help.\n  The problem is that the President encouraged us to pass No Child Left \nBehind, which tests for and identifies the problem, but then the \nadministration refuses to send resources to deal with it. So now we \nhave school districts testing kids right and left, coming up with \nresults, some of them being labeled as failing schools, and they turn \nto us and say: Well, will you give us a helping hand? You put mandates \non us, such as treating special education students, and instead of \nproviding 40 percent of the cost of that education as you promised, you \nare only providing 18 percent. And now you identify students within our \nschools who are falling behind in testing, and yet no resources come \nforward--resources for smaller classroom sizes, resources for tutoring \nand mentoring, resources for afterschool programs and summer programs.\n\n  So if we are serious about being competitive in the 21st century, if \nwe are serious about producing the health care professionals and \nengineering specialists and scientists we need to make sure we are \ncompetitive in this world, we must be serious about education at East \nSt. Louis Senior High School and every school across America. We must \nfocus our resources on America. A strong America begins at home, and it \nbegins at home with our schools. It has been the ladder for generation \nafter generation in America.\n  As I stand here, we spend $2 billion a week on the war in Iraq. I \nvoted for every penny for it. Although I voted against the resolution \nto go to war, it was my feeling that if it were my son or daughter in \nuniform, I would give them everything they needed to come home safely \nwith their mission accomplished. But it is an expensive undertaking \nwith no end in sight.\n  We decided--the President decided--that for our national security \npurposes, we would have to shoulder this burden of $400 billion. That \nis what the war has cost us to date, approximately. I will leave here \nin a moment and go to the Senate Appropriations Committee, where we \nhave been asked for another $100 billion for the war in Iraq. I am \nconfident it will pass quickly with bipartisan support. But if we are \ncoming down to the basics in America, we have sacrificed things we need \nin our country in order to strengthen the country of Iraq. We have put \nbillions of dollars on the plate for hospitals and schools and \ninfrastructure to rebuild this country, while America has fallen short \nin many of the same areas.\n  So when we deal with this amendment on the future of health care in \nthe world and in America, we need to focus on fairness when it comes to \nimmigrants, health care professional immigrants from other countries. \nWe need to create opportunities for health care professionals to help \nin other countries, but we need to focus resources in America on making \nus\n\n[[Page S2774]]\n\nstrong as a nation right here at home. That means strengthening our \nschools, demanding of our kids that they not only do well on tests but \nstand by them to help if they are not doing well so they can improve \nand do better on the next test, and make a commitment as a nation for \nthat to happen.\n  According to the World Health Organization, Africa loses 20,000 \nhealth professionals a year. It is part of a brain-drain. The United \nStates is the largest consumer of health care professionals from some \nof the poorest places in the world, followed by France, Germany, and \nGreat Britain. In the United States, we deal with rural and inner-city \nhealth care shortages, which we need to continue to address. But we \nunderstand now that many nursing schools have long waiting lists of \nqualified applicants. We don't have the capacity in many of our \nschools--nursing, medical schools, and the like--so we need to expand \nthat base within our own country to produce those who can teach and \nthose who can learn to serve us in medical professions in the years to \ncome.\n\n  Let me give an example of another country aside from the Congo, which \nI mentioned earlier. Ethiopia has only 3 doctors for every 100,000 \npeople and 20 nurses; 3 for every 100,000 people. In the United States, \nwe have 549 doctors for every 100,000 people and 773 nurses. Yet \naccording to Ambassador Randall Tobias, who has been confirmed as the \nU.S. Director of Foreign Assistance, there are more Ethiopian-trained \ndoctors in Chicago than in the country of Ethiopia.\n  In the Democratic Republic of Congo, which I mentioned earlier, there \nwere severe shortages of doctors and medical professionals at a time \nwhen those areas were desperately fighting the global AIDS epidemic. In \nZambia, nearly a quarter of the adult population is infected with HIV/\nAIDS. But Zambia has lost over 90 percent of its doctors who graduated \nfrom medical school in the 1980s and 1990s and emigrated out of the \ncountry to the West and to Europe.\n  Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice recently said:\n\n       HIV/AIDS is not only a human tragedy of enormous magnitude, \n     it is also a threat to the stability of entire countries and \n     entire regions of the world.\n\n  We must make certain that we have the resources available through the \nGlobal Fund, through our PEPFAR appropriations, as well as \nappropriations to USAID and other agencies. But we also have to make \ncertain that when a country overseas that is battling disease, that is \ntrying to provide the most basic health care for its citizens, is doing \nits best, we should not be luring away their health care professionals \nwho promised they would stay. I think we can extend America's health \ncare capacity. We can do it with a strategy that includes good \neducation for our children, focusing on math, science, and critical \nlanguages but also making certain our professional schools can generate \nthe doctors and nurses we need.\n  Today, with this amendment, we would take two modest steps in the \nright direction by passing the amendment to require would-be immigrants \nto fulfill pledges of service and to offer members of the Diaspora \ncommunity who are working here a chance to share their badly needed \nskills. Imagine living in a country with 3 doctors for every 100,000 \npeople. Then ask yourself what can we do about it. This amendment is a \nstart.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Kennedy be \nrecognized as the next Democratic speaker for up to 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The order is to recognize the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I think the Senate had a rough kind of \norder in terms of speaking. I was told that this was the time to speak \neven in terms of other Senators. I intended to speak now. I ask \nunanimous consent that the Senator be recognized after I finish.\n  Does that help the Senator?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, how long will \nhe speak?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Probably 20 minutes.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Would the Senator mind if I went for maybe 2 or 3 \nminutes?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I have no objection.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, to be fair, realizing that there will be \nobjection to laying down amendments, I would speak maybe 2 or 3 minutes \ntotal.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, at the end of my remarks, I will ask to \nlay the pending business aside. Let me speak for a moment on the issue \nof immigration.\n  We are dealing with one of the most difficult issues that we will \nconsider this year. It is difficult from a political standpoint, and it \nis difficult from a policy standpoint.\n  If we could poll all 100 Senators, we would probably have 100 \ndifferent ways of solving the problem of illegal immigration.\n  However, I think we can all agree that we need to secure our borders. \nThis should be our number one priority, and our national security \ndepends on it. Then, we can begin to consider other reforms.\n  I, personally, believe it is important that we first secure all of \nour borders, including our Southern border, our Northern border, and \nour ports. Once we have secured our borders, as part of a comprehensive \nreform effort, we can then consider a temporary worker program. This \nprogram should require the worker to be continuously employed. It \nshould also ensure that workers are contributing members of society, \nand are working to become proficient in English. In addition, this \nprogram should encourage the worker to have health care coverage.\n  I have drafted several amendments that are different from the current \nunderlying bill. It is important that these amendments and other \nlegislative proposals be considered for debate.\n  It is unfortunate that the other side is blocking the amendment \nprocess on the bill. They don't want to take some tough votes. I \nunderstand that. However, immigration reform is a critical issue facing \nour country. We must have a full debate in the Senate, which includes \nan opportunity to bring up amendments, have votes on them, and then \ndetermine how to proceed. I, and many of my colleagues, have several \namendments that I believe will be very constructive to this process.\n  Many of us want a verifiable database from which employers can search \nfor the legal work status of their employees. It may be several years \nbefore we can actually have that database up and running. The technical \nproblems associated with the database are not addressed in the current \nunderlying bill. I believe some of my colleagues have offered an \namendment to address this important issue, and I believe my colleagues \nshould be heard.\n  We also have to look at Social Security. Two of my amendments address \nserious issues related to Social Security.\n  In order to qualify for full Social Security retirement benefits, a \nworker must work a minimum of 10 years. Under current law, individuals \nwho work in the United States illegally, and later obtain legal \nemployment status, can use their illegal work history to qualify for \nbenefits.\n  The promise of Social Security is for citizens and legal residents of \nthe United States. It was not intended for individuals who enter our \ncountry illegally, purchase fraudulent green cards and documentation on \nthe black market, and use them to get jobs. At a time when the solvency \nof our Social Security system is in question, it is wrong to allow \nthose who have broken our laws to receive credit for their illegal work \nhistory.\n  In addition, I have serious concerns about the proposed Totalization \nAgreement with Mexico and its impact on the Social Security Trust Fund. \nThe effects of the Totalization Agreement depend on the specific terms \nand language included in the agreement. We\n\n[[Page S2775]]\n\ndo not know the terms of the agreement and will not know the exact \nterms until the President submits the agreement to Congress. We also \ndon't know the exact cost of a Totalization Agreement with Mexico. I am \nconcerned that if this agreement were to go into effect, it could \nseverely impact the Social Security Trust Fund and threaten the \nretirement benefits of hard-working Americans. This issue needs to be \naddressed in the context of this debate.\n  I believe there are many technical problems with this bill that must \nbe debated on the Senate floor. These issues should be addressed out in \nthe open so that the American people can see what is being discussed. \nUnfortunately, this process is not going forward because the amendment \nprocess is being blocked.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendments be laid aside, \nand that I would be allowed to offer an amendment at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, in closing, I realize that there are many \ndifferences in this chamber. Both Republicans and Democrats have \ndifferent views on various aspects of this legislation. I believe it is \nabsolutely critical that we move this process forward, that we allow \nfor full debate on the Senate floor, and that we allow amendments to be \ndebated and voted on.\n  I encourage my colleagues to think about how we proceed, as this is a \ncritical issue facing our country.\n  I yield the floor, and I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for \nyielding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. From my own personal \nexperience, the Senator has been very much involved and engaged in the \nprovisions of the legislation--and has been during the consideration \nthat we had in the Judiciary Committee.\n  Mr. President, I remind Members about where we are at the present \ntime with the proposal passed out of the Judiciary Committee 12 to 6, \nbipartisan.\n  We had some 6 days of markups. We considered hundreds of different \namendments. I was looking over a number of the amendments that had been \nconsidered and offered. There may be a few that weren't, but just about \nall of those were considered at one time or another before the \nJudiciary Committee. We held 7 days of hearings, listened to all \ndifferent individuals who had a variety of different opinions on a wide \nvariety of different subjects.\n  The basic legislation that we are considering here, in one form or \nanother, has been out there for more than 2\\1/2\\ years prior to the \n2004 election. I introduced legislation that had a number of parts of \nthis legislation. Senator McCain introduced legislation, and Senator \nDaschle and Senator Hagel worked together.\n  After the elections in 2004-2005, Senator McCain and I worked \ntogether in May of 2005 and presented this legislation.\n  This issue has been before both our committee with extensive \nhearings. We had a markup as a result of the action of the chairman of \nour committee. We had the opportunity to take some action on this.\n  I know there are those who would like to discuss this and discuss and \ncontinue to discuss. Sometimes this institution has to take action. I \nam very hopeful we will be able to do that in these next couple of \ndays.\n  Some Senators have tried to frame the debate on immigration between \nthe Judiciary Committee bill and Senator Frist's bill as a debate \nbetween those who would be tough on enforcement and those who would \nnot.\n  We all recognize that our current immigration enforcement system is \nbroken. Enforcement provisions is an area where a good deal of \nconsensus has already emerged in this Chamber.\n  Both bills under consideration would enhance our capacity to monitor \nthe immigration flows and stop illegal entry. They would double the \nnumber of Border Patrol agents over the next 5 years; add significant \nnew technology at the border to create a ``virtual fence''; develop new \nland and water surveillance plans; authorize new highway checkpoints \nnear the border; and expand the exit-entry security system to all land \nborders and airports.\n  Both bills would increase our capacity to crack down on criminal \nsyndicates that smuggle immigrants into the country and place them at \ngreat risk. They would create new criminal penalties for evading or \nrefusing to obey commands of immigration officers and new criminal \npenalties for financial transactions involving money laundering or \nsmuggling. They would create new fraudproof biometric immigration \ndocuments; direct increased resources to antifraud detection; and \nimprove coordination among Federal, State, local, and tribal agencies \nto combat alien smuggling.\n  Both bills would increase cooperation with Mexico to strengthen that \ncountry's southern border to prevent illegal migration from Central \nAmerica through Mexico into the United States. Both bills would \nfacilitate cooperation with other governments in the region to prevent \ninternational gang activity.\n\n  In addition, both bills would reduce the job magnet in America by \ncreating a universal electronic eligibility verification system so that \nemployers can determine whether potential employees are authorized to \nwork in the United States--very important. That does not exist today, \nand it is the basis of a great deal of the abuse that currently exists. \nIt is one of the principal reasons the 1986 act was a failure.\n  They had a provision to adjust the status of amnesty in 1986, but \nthere would also be the requirement for ensuring that we were going to \nhave the vigorous enforcement. It never happened, never existed because \nwe were unable to develop the kind of verification that is so \nimportant. We do that under this legislation.\n  Both bills will substantially increase the penalties on employers \nthat fail to comply with eligibility verification rules. And both bills \nwill add 5,000 new enforcement agents to back up these provisions. We \nhave had virtually no enforcement whatsoever. That has existed under \nRepublican and Democratic administrations. But under this legislation, \nwe will.\n  The Frist bill places greater emphasis on border fencing, a method of \nimmigration control which we believe has proven ineffective over the \nlast 10 years. The Judiciary Committee bill imposes new penalties on \nindividuals who construct, finance, or use unlawful tunnels under the \nborder. We believe this approach is important for enforcement. Senator \nFeinstein has said these tunnels are one of the various methods \nimmigrants now use to circumvent border fencing.\n  The real difference between these two bills involves what we do in \naddition--in addition--to these tough, new enforcement measures. Over \nthe last week, we have heard two very different answers to this \nquestion, reflecting fundamentally different views of immigrants and \nthe steps we should take to reform.\n  The Frist bill follows the lead of the House of Representatives. It \ntreats immigrants as criminals. In fact, the Frist bill declares that \nall undocumented immigrants are criminals. It goes further than that, \nactually making it a felony to provide undocumented immigrants with \nnonemergency humanitarian assistance.\n  In bipartisan votes, two-thirds of the members of the Judiciary \nCommittee rejected these measures because they conflict with our basic \nvalues, and they would do nothing to actually reduce the number of \nundocumented immigrants in this country. This is one reason why at \nleast 184 religious groups support comprehensive reform with a path \ntoward permanent status instead.\n  This is what they call the Cardinal Mahony provision, where Cardinal \nMahony says his challenge is to deal with and help the poor, not to \ncheck their immigration status. When a mother consults and asks the \ncardinal, ``My child is sick. Should I be going outside the country and \nreturning to Mexico?'' and Cardinal Mahony would say, ``Your \nresponsibility is to your child,'' that is aiding and abetting someone \nfrom returning to Mexico, and under the House bill they would be guilty \nof a felony. We are doing that for those who are members of the clergy, \nhumanitarian organizations, nonprofit organizations. It is absolutely \nwrong. As Cardinal Mahony said, it is the most vicious piece of \nlegislation he has ever seen.\n\n[[Page S2776]]\n\n  So our bill is not just tough on immigration enforcement; it also \ntakes the necessary steps to make enforcement effective. We have tried \nenforcement, and what we have seen over the last 10 years is how it has \nfailed.\n  Ten years ago, there were 40,000 illegal immigrants who were coming \ninto the United States. Now there are more than 400,000. We have spent \n$20 billion. We have increased border guards 300 percent over that \nperiod of time. We have created 66 miles of fencing along the border in \nthe South. We have 1,800 miles to go along the Mexican border, 4,200 \nmiles to go along the Canadian border on this.\n  We have to try. This has been a bankrupt policy. And to try to just \ndo enforcement--enforcement only--is not going to work. How many more \nbillions of dollars do we have to spend?\n  Our program is so much more efficient. The reason why is, we give \nfocus and attention to those who are the troublemakers, the criminals, \nand those who are going to be dangerous to Americans.\n  The Border Patrol will be targeted in using its resources on those \nwho are a danger to the United States, not chasing gardeners around the \ndesert in the Southwest, which is happening now. That is a very major \ndifference.\n  People who talk about national security understand this. That is why \nSecretary Chertoff testified we needed a comprehensive approach. That \nis an understanding. We understand this is a national security issue. \nAs well as preserving and protecting our borders, it is a \nnational security issue. We understand that. We have taken the steps in \nour enforcement provisions to make sure that is the case.\n\n  It is also dealing with our whole march toward progress in terms of \nopening up economic opportunity. And most importantly, I think it is a \nvalue issue about how we are going to treat individuals who work hard, \nlove their family, play by the rules, pay their taxes, want to study \nEnglish, want to be good citizens, and in many instances enlist in the \nmilitary forces--70,000 of them over in Iraq and Afghanistan, in the \nservice. Many are serving in Afghanistan.\n  That is the profile. That is generally the profile of what we like \nfor our fellow Americans. Ninety-eight percent of the undocumented male \nworkers are working today in the United States of America. These are \nhard-working people, trying to provide for their families.\n  It is interesting, to divert for a minute, the incidents, for \nexample, of families staying together is much higher among those groups \nthan the native population. There is a greater expenditure in education \nas to their children than among the native population, a much greater \nexpenditure in terms of music and the arts as compared to the native \npopulation, a much greater evidence of attendance to church and \nreligion as compared to the native population.\n  These are hard-working individuals who want to play by the rules. \nUnder our particular legislation, they have to conform to the rules or \nthey are out, and they have to do it for 11 years before they become a \ncitizen--11 years--without running into any trouble, paying their taxes \nand doing what needs to be done. That is what is in our effort.\n  First, we strengthen the enforcement at the border and within the \nUnited States. We all agree with that point.\n  Second, we provide a path to legal status which will bring the 11 \nmillion undocumented immigrants already within the United States out of \nthe shadows, and disrupt the culture of illegality which now corrodes \nour system.\n  Third, we must provide legal channels for future immigration flows so \nthat U.S. employers who are unable to attract native workers are not \ntempted to hire illegal immigrants. And those procedures are outlined.\n  I have heard many speak about the guest worker program, and they have \nnot read the bill. For the most part, they have to advertise in the \nUnited States in their area or region in terms of the worker, and then \nthe individual who is selected has to meet all of the other various \ncriminal background checks, other kinds of security checks.\n  They come to the United States, and rather than being exploited--as \nthe workforce is today--as an undocumented, they are guaranteed the \nworker protections in the legislation in terms of prevailing wage, \nDavis-Bacon, other provisions, service contract provisions.\n  So rather than depressing wages--as exists today, and without this \nlegislation will continue--this elevates them. That is enormously \nimportant.\n  I want to mention a particular provision in our bill that is \nextremely important; that is, the Judiciary Committee took the long \noverdue step of enacting what we call the DREAM Act. Under the DREAM \nAct, undocumented immigrant children would be given an opportunity to \nbecome American citizens if they can prove good moral character, if \nthey have graduated from high school, and if they go on to college or \njoin the military.\n  Many of my constituents in Massachusetts are undocumented children \nwho would benefit from this act. I wish to share three of their \nstories, provided by the Massachusetts Immigrant & Refugee Advocacy \nCoalition:\n  Mario has lived in Chelsea, MA, for the past 7 years. He is a stellar \nstudent, patient caretaker for his 4-year-old brother, and a leader in \nthe community. Mario is currently facing deportation. In Mario's own \nwords:\n\n       I did not make the choice to come to this country; however, \n     over time this country has become my home. My time in the \n     U.S. has consisted of nothing but hard work and positive \n     service to the community and all I want is for that to \n     continue. I see this country as my home, and I have always \n     striven to do the right thing. I know that I have a lot to \n     offer this country if I am only given the chance to do so.\n\n  Jessica was brought to this country when she was 3 years old, \noriginally from the Dominican Republic. She graduated last year with \nhonors from Madison Park High School in Boston but was unable to pursue \nher dream of studying psychology because of her status. Jessica was a \nmember of the National Honor Society and an officer in the Marine \nJROTC. Jessica says going to college is the only way for her to secure \na better future for herself and her family. The United States is the \nonly country she has ever known.\n  Flavio graduated last year from the Burke High School in Dorchester. \nHe made a complete turnaround from 9th grade to his sophomore year--he \nturned Ds and Fs into all As and Bs. When asked about his amazing \nturnaround, he responds that his mother sent him to this country to do \nsomething with his life and that is what he decided to do. He is a \nmember of the National Honor Society, honor roll, captain of the track \nand soccer teams. He was accepted at Roxbury Community College but was \nnot able to attend because of lack of access to financial aid or \nscholarships. Flavio's parents sent him to the U.S. at the young age of \n11, hoping he would have a better life here than in Cape Verde.\n  These kids aspire to U.S. citizenship, and America benefits when they \nhave a chance to earn it.\n  The Judiciary Committee bill includes enhanced enforcement, earned \nlegalization for those who are here, and a realistic guest worker \nprogram for the future. This is a real comprehensive plan for repairing \nour broken immigration system, and it is not a campaign slogan.\n  First, many of those who oppose real comprehensive reform have \nmischaracterized our arguments in recent days, and they have introduced \na number of amendments which would undermine our reform efforts. So let \nme set the record straight.\n  First, let me set the record straight on amnesty. Our bill does not \nprovide undocumented immigrants with amnesty. Amnesty, by definition, \nis an automatic pardon or free pass granted to a group of individuals \nwithout requiring any actions in return.\n  Mr. President, I understand I only have 5 minutes left, 4\\1/2\\ \nminutes. Am I correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The Senator has 13 minutes left.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Thirteen.\n  Well, in any event, let me go through very quickly the earned \nlegalization requirements.\n  First, you must have entered and continuously resided in the U.S. \nbefore January 2004; must remain continuously employed; must pay $2,000 \nin penalties; must pass security background checks; must pass a medical \nexam; must learn English; must learn U.S. history and government; must \npay all back taxes; must get to the back of the line behind all \napplicants waiting for\n\n[[Page S2777]]\n\ngreen cards; and, after obtaining a green card, must wait another 5 \nyears before becoming eligible to apply for naturalization.\n  There it is. Amnesty means pardon and forgiveness. This is what they \nhave to do.\n  They have to continue to earn for 11 years. That is the fastest you \ncan gain it, 11 years. And you have to earn it every day by not only \npaying your penalties but meeting the security checks, learning English \nand history, paying all of the taxes. That is what is included. That is \nwhy many of us who are supporters of it resent, quite frankly, the \ndistortion and misrepresentation that has been made on the floor. I \nhave listened to it. Here in this Chamber people have mischaracterized \nour legislation, and then they differ with it.\n  It is interesting because so many of our Republican friends have been \nable to understand the legislation. George Will understands this. Brit \nHume, who is a commentator on FOX, certainly understands it. He spelled \nit out. Bill Kristol, who is a conservative spokesman, understands it. \nHe actually supports it. The list goes on. They understand what this is \nabout. That is why it is troublesome when we hear some of our \ncolleagues on the other side repeatedly misstate what this is about. I \ncan understand if you state correctly what it is about and you differ \nwith it. I will differ with you, but I can understand and respect it. \nBut what is happening is a complete distortion and misrepresentation as \nto what we have.\n  On law enforcement, this is the language from the legislation: The \nrequirement to eliminate the visa backlog. If the backlog of \napplications for family-based and employer-based immigrant visas is not \neliminated within the 6 years following the date of enactment, as \npredicted under the formula set out in title V, the amendments made by \nthe title, the Secretary shall hold in abeyance an application--that \nmeans you go to the end of the line--submitted by an alien granted \nconditional nonimmigrant work authorization.\n  Those are the two aspects of it: the one that sets out the \nrequirements of what an individual is going to have to do in 11 years \nand this provision in the legislation that says they will go \neffectively to the back of the line. That is how we deal with the 11 \nmillion individuals who are here. I have listened a little bit to the \narguments against this provision, but what we have not heard is what \nthe other side is for.\n  You are against our provision. What are you for? Are you for \ndeportation? Where is your $240 billion--that is the best estimate--to \nmove these individuals out? Who are they? They are the parents of \nAmerican citizens, in many instances, disrupting families, disrupting \nrelationships that have been going on for years. It would take the \nbuses to go from San Diego to Anchorage, AK, bumper to bumper, if we \nwere to deport 11 million people at $240 billion.\n  They are all so eloquent, those who differ with us. But you never \nhear what they are for. They just happen to be against this provision \nwhich is an essential part of this whole effort. That is something \nwhich is important.\n  I see my friend and colleague here who wants to address the issue. I \nhave other comments, but I will come back a little later in the \nafternoon and address them. I hope we can move along. I know there are \na number of amendments that have been examined and are acceptable. I \nhope we move those along. I hope we move to a point where we can have \nsome votes and make a determination on the judgment of this body.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me say about my colleague, the senior \nSenator from Massachusetts, that in the 44 years he has been here, he \nhas been one of the Senate's--the Senate's, probably--leading \nspokespeople for a fair, sensible, value-based approach to immigration. \nI have been here for a couple of the fights on immigration we have had, \nhaving come to the Senate in 1985. But I have never seen somebody as \ncareful and as deliberative and as thoughtful about how to balance the \nequities that are involved in this issue and, most importantly, \nsomebody who never forgets what defines this country. It is not just \nimmigrants who understand what Senator Kennedy has been fighting for. \nIt is those who really understand, such as the people Senator Kennedy \nwas talking about--Bill Kristol, George Will and others, conservatives \nwho understand the values as well as the pragmatic issues which define \nthis question of immigration. So I thank my colleague for his many \nyears of leadership on this and for the experience which he brings to \nthe debate.\n  Obviously, this debate matters enormously to our country. There is no \ndoubt that Americans in every State in the Union and people around the \nworld are watching what we do and how we do it. We have witnessed a \nremarkable demonstration of public protest and of civic participation \nin cities across America. In the Senate, in our communities, we are \nonce again wrestling with difficult issues. These are not easy. Nobody \nis suggesting they are easy. But the question of immigration reform is \nan issue that goes to the heart of who we are as a people and that \ndefines us as a nation. It is an issue that has historically divided \nus, revealing that sometimes humanity and courage are side by side with \nisolationism and fear and sometimes, sadly, even bigotry.\n  We may be divided today, as we try to figure out how we are going to \ngo forward here, but I don't think there is any Senator who disagrees \nabout our past and our heritage as a nation of immigrants, of people \nwho have come to the United States in search of a better life and \nfreedom, of opportunity, and who want to have their voices heard. We \nalso all agree that our current immigration system is broken. We agree \nthat more resources have to be sent to the border in order to \nstrengthen enforcement, to add more Border Patrol agents, and invest in \nnew technologies.\n\n  I spent a number of years as a prosecutor. I didn't have to deal \ndirectly with immigration at the county level, but I certainly saw what \na lack of resources did, in a prosecutor's office, to our ability to \npick the crimes that we were prosecuting, our ability to prioritize \ncertain kinds of crimes to move through the judicial system. The fact \nis, had it not been back in those days for an extraordinary infusion of \nFederal dollars through the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration, \nwe never could have done half the things we did--like priority \nprosecution so you could take any felony from arrest to conviction in \n90 days, Federal money made that difference; where we could have a rape \ncounseling unit, one of the first in the country, Federal money made \nthat difference; where we could have a victim witness assistance \nprogram so people would be helped through the criminal justice system, \nFederal money made that difference.\n  Here we are with less border guards on our 2,000-mile border than we \nhave police officers in the City of New York. They don't have the \nresources. So as we stand here and debate this issue in the Senate, we \nneed to be honest about our own responsibility for the situation we \nfind ourselves in today. This is not something a Republican President \ndid or a Democratic President did or a Republican Congress/Democratic \nCongress. It is something the United States has allowed to take shape \nover the last 30, 40, 50 years. It is not new. And you can't come in \nand sort of bring down a wall and say: OK, we are going to do \nenforcement and forget about the magnet that already exists, the \ninequities that have already been put in place because a whole bunch of \npeople knew the borders were porous, because a whole bunch of people \nknew employers would hire them if they came here illegally which, \nincidentally, is against the law. But where are the prosecutors \nprosecuting that in the past? It hasn't been happening.\n  So our system is broken. What we need to do, consistent with our \nvalues and history as a country that has welcomed and honored \nimmigrants, is to deal with the current situation in a realistic, open, \nfairminded way that tries to find the common ground between us.\n  I believe we can do that, but it is a problem we have to think about \nfrom both sides. I have spent some time in the last months, knowing \nthis debate was going to take place, meeting with members of the \nCongressional Hispanic Caucus and trying to understand how people are \nthinking about this. How does somebody who has come into the country, \nwho has been here for 15 years, 20 years, who has raised their\n\n[[Page S2778]]\n\nkids, whose kids have friends, who has gone to the local school, who is \ngoing to college now, how do they see this? How do we all see this?\n  We have 11 million, approximately, undocumented immigrants living and \nworking in the United States. The Nation's employers want these people, \nevidently, because they are hiring them. It is against the law to hire \nthem, but they are hiring them. How many Americans have gone down to a \nstreet corner and hired somebody or had somebody mow the lawn or \nsomebody come over to the house to clean out the garage or do something \nand paid them cash?\n  The fact is, there are low-skilled, low-wage jobs that a whole bunch \nof Americans don't want to necessarily fill. I know during the 1990s, \nwe reached an unemployment level of about 2 percent plus in \nMassachusetts. I believe it was around 4 percent as a nation, \neffectively full employment in the United States. Still there were a \nwhole bunch of low-wage jobs people didn't want to do. There simply \naren't enough visas for the people who want to come in to do those jobs \nand for the jobs that people want to have done to fill. And with the \nlure of higher paying jobs than in their home countries, workers come \nin to fill them. That is a centuries-old reality, not just here but in \ncountries all around the world.\n  The system that employers are supposed to use to verify the legal \nstatus of employees is fundamentally weak. It is subject to \nexploitation by everybody. The workers can exploit it by getting false \ndocuments, and the employers can exploit it by ignoring documents that \nthey know are false or by avoiding the requirement to comply with the \nlaw.\n  Our challenge here in the Senate is not to demagog this issue. It is \nnot to say: Boy, if we just enforced the border, that is the whole \ndeal.\n  It is not the whole deal. Everybody who has thought about this issue \nin any serious way knows that is not the whole deal. If we are going to \ndeal with 11 million undocumented workers who are currently living in \nthe shadows in America and be fair to our history and our values, we \nhave to create a comprehensive reform program. Some people on the other \nside of the aisle suggest all we have to do is shut down the border and \nthat is it, just shut the border. They believe the approximately 11 \nmillion undocumented immigrants currently living and working in America \nare going to return home. Are they serious? People who have a job, paid \ntheir dues, paid their taxes, didn't get in trouble, kids are in high \nschool about to graduate or in college, they are going to pack up and \ngo home? Back to what?\n  For those who won't leave voluntarily, these people believe we are \ngoing to have all our police officers and everybody go out and find \nthem and round them up and deport them. How would you do that? How do \nyou find 11 million people who are living in the shadows? How are you \ngoing to compel them to leave? What are you going to say to their \nchildren and grandchildren and the businesses and the communities that \ndepend on them? What is the image going to be around the world? You can \nsee the cartoons as the United States is busy rounding up these folks, \nherding them into buses, sending them back.\n  George Will summed this up pretty well in his column last week. He \nwrote:\n\n       Of the nation's illegal immigrants--estimated to be at \n     least 11 million, a cohort larger than the combined \n     populations of 12 States--60 percent have been here at least \n     five years. Most have roots in their communities. Their \n     children born here are U.S. citizens.\n\n  Those children, because they were born in the United States, are U.S. \ncitizens; that is what our Constitution says. So are we going to \nseparate parents and grandparents from American citizen children?\n\n       We are not going to take the draconian police measures \n     necessary to deport 11 million people. They would fill \n     200,000 buses in a caravan stretching bumper-to-bumper from \n     San Diego to Alaska--where, by the way, 26,000 Latinos live. \n     And there are no plausible incentives to get 11 million to \n     board the buses.\n\n  That is what George Will said.\n  Mr. President, offering up border enforcement as a panacea is a great \npolitical talking point. You can go out, and there are places where \npeople will stomp their feet and clap their hands and say: Isn't that \ntrue? But it is not a real strategy, it is not a way to fix our broken \nimmigration system.\n  I am also troubled by the anti-immigrant statements made during this \ndebate, which expose a limited understanding of the role of immigrants \nand immigrant workers and the role that they play in the fabric of our \neconomy and our society and our communities. Most troubling is, I \nthink, that these statements are statements that are made to try to \ndivide people. For example, arguing against the need for immigrant \nlabor, Congressman Dana Rohrabacher said:\n\n       Let the prisoners pick the fruits. We can do it without \n     bringing in millions of foreigners.\n\n  According to Congressman Bob Beauprez:\n\n       If we continue down this path that the Senate has \n     established, . . . we will have created the biggest magnet \n     ever. It would be like a dinner bell, ``come one, come all.''\n\n  Congressman Steve King says that anyone who supports a guest worker \nproposal should be ``branded with a scarlet letter A,'' for \n``amnesty.''\n  Congressman Tom Tancredo wants to turn America into a gated \ncommunity, warning people that among the people crossing our borders \nare ``people coming to kill me and you and your children.'' He laments \nthe ``cult of multiculturalism'' and worries that America is becoming a \n``Tower of Babel.''\n  I would like Tom Tancredo to go over to Iraq, where there are 70,000 \nlegal immigrants serving this country, and ask them how they feel about \na ``Tower of Babel'' and about the values of this country.\n  These statements do not reflect the contribution that immigrants have \nmade to our country over centuries. They don't reflect the \ncontributions that they make today. Most of us in this country--almost \nall of us in this country descend from immigrants. That is who we are. \nI am privileged to be married to an immigrant, who didn't become an \nAmerican citizen until, I think, she was 24 or 25 years old.\n  I know how loyal people can become to a country that welcomes them \nand gives them the ability to fulfill the American dream. The vast \nmajority of the American people understand the value that immigrants \nprovide to our country. They understand that enforcement alone is not \ngoing to work, and they have taken to the streets to make their voices \nheard. Half a million people demonstrated in Los Angeles to protest an \nenforcement-only approach to immigration reform, far surpassing the \nnumber of people who protested the Vietnam war. More than 10,000 people \nparticipated in the ``Day Without Latinos'' rally in Milwaukee, WI, \nleaving their jobs and marching through downtown. Similar walkouts \noccurred in other parts of the country with students and laborers \nprotesting enforcement-only immigration proposals such as the House \nbill. Churches and humanitarian organizations have become actively \ninvolved in the fight for comprehensive immigration reform. In fact, \nyesterday I spoke with Hispanic evangelical leaders from across the \ncountry about their concerns regarding the immigration crisis in our \ncountry. Cardinal Roger Mahoney, the archbishop of Los Angeles, has \nspearheaded an effort by the Roman Catholic Church to defy the House \nbill that criminalizes immigrants and the organizations that help those \nimmigrants.\n  You heard my colleague, Senator Kennedy, talk about what would happen \nif somebody reaches out to the poor, the needy, the sick, which is a \nfundamental tenet of any religion. And this bill in the House wants to \ncriminalize that.\n  The people are making their voices heard. They understand what is at \nstake in this debate. They understand the role that immigrants play in \nthis country, and they are fighting to ensure that we end up with a \nfair humanitarian, realistic solution. Now, while some people look at \nenforcement only--incidentally, let me say that during the election of \n2004, I spoke up as forcefully as I could in New Mexico, Arizona, \nColorado, and lots of places where there are lots of immigrants. I \nconsistently said that you have to have comprehensive reform. I didn't \njust talk about earned legalization or about guest workers; I talked \nabout the need to crack down on businesses that are illegally hiring \npeople. We need to have\n\n[[Page S2779]]\n\na simple and honest way for people to know who is applying for work.\n  This is common sense, particularly in a post-9/11 world, where it is \nimportant for American security to know who is coming into our country. \nSo we need to do that. You cannot look at enforcement-only but rather \nthe comprehensive bill like that which is being considered on the floor \nof the Senate. I am encouraged by what the Judiciary Committee, in a \nbipartisan bill, did, which is now a full substitute to Senator Frist's \nbill, and that is the bill offered by Senator Specter.\n\n  As Senator Kennedy and others have said, the Specter amendment has \nthe four cornerstones of real immigration reform. You cannot do it \nwithout all four. No. 1, you have to have a strengthening of our border \nenforcement. That means using all of the latest technology to build a \nvirtual fence--use the sensors that we have available in the military, \nuse the cameras and technology, and use more human presence to add to \nthe Border Patrol that is currently there; make sure enough vehicles \nare there, which is an amendment I intend to offer if we get into the \nsubstantive part of the debate. It has been much neglected through the \nyears by all in strengthening the border.\n  Second, regulate visas in order to meet the work flow needs. And you \nhave to do it in a more effective way than we have in the past.\n  Third, you have to provide a path for legalization for people who \nhave been here for a long period of time, played by the rules, raised \ntheir families, and have children who are American citizens. We need to \nfind a way to do that so that it is not, as some of our colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle say, opening the door and making a fool of \nthe law. I am not for doing that. The law has to mean something.\n  Indeed, in this bill, from 2004 forward, there is no eligibility for \npeople to have earned legalization. It shuts the door after 2004. It \nbrings down a wall but in a comprehensive way that has a starting point \nthat says: OK, we acknowledge that for a long period of time we didn't \nhave a realistic system, we were not able to stop people from coming \nin. What is the fairest way to deal with this problem, to send notice \nin the future that this is a new get-tough policy in the United States \nand a policy that will be backed up by adequate border security, by a \nrealistic visa program that commands respect of people, and by a \nlegitimate effort to bring people out of the shadows, which also \ncommands the respect of people everywhere.\n  Finally, we need to help employers enforce our laws. You have to have \na way for the employer not to be turned into a police officer but to \neasily, and with certainty, be able to determine whether the documents \nthey are looking at are real and whether the person they are looking \nat, presenting the documents, is the person that it purports to be.\n  Mr. President, the Specter amendment is tough on border security. It \nis important because this debate has gone on as if there is a bill out \nthere that is for border security--the Frist bill and the House bill--\nand this other bill that somehow is not. That is not accurate. The \nSpecter amendment is tough on enforcement and border security. Almost \nevery provision of the other bill--the Frist bill--is in there. And it \nis unfair to assume that it doesn't have strong enforcement provisions.\n  The Specter substitute doubles the size of the Border Patrol by \nadding 12,000 new agents over the next 5 years. It doubles interior \nenforcement by adding 5,000 investigators over the next 5 years. It \nadds new technology at the border to create the virtual fence that I \ntalked about. It expands the exit and the entry system at all land and \nairports. It mandates a new land and water surveillance plan, and it \nincreases the criminal penalties for violating our immigration laws.\n  That is a tough bill with tough enforcement. It also addresses the \nreason that undocumented workers come to this country. They come to \nthis country looking for jobs, and the demand for labor in our country \nis one of the things that pulls them here. So workers cross the border \nbecause we don't have enough visas to be able to permit people to cross \nlegally, so they come illegally. Guess what. They get a job when they \nget here. That is illegal.\n  One of the key elements to stopping the illegal flow of workers \nacross the border is to increase the number of visas for people to come \nlegally and also to have an adequate ability for the employer to have \nno excuse for not knowing the legality of the people who work with \nthem. There should be a no-fault system here, where there is an \nautomatic presumption of the employer's ability to enforce.\n  The temporary worker program that is created by the Specter \nsubstitute, in my judgment, will help to regularize the flow of \nimmigrant workers in and out of this country. I understand some people \nfear allowing temporary workers into the United States. They think it \nwill hurt American workers and depress their wages. Again, that is a \nphony ``bogeyman.'' That is a red herring in this debate. Either people \nhave not read the temporary worker program or they chose to allow \nthemselves to be completely misled by it.\n  The temporary program has labor protections and it has market wage \nrequirements. The worker has to receive at least the same wage as \nsomeone similarly situated or at the prevailing wage level for that \njob, whichever is greater. So there is a wage enforcement mechanism \nthat will not allow that depression.\n  The workers will receive a 3-year visa, reviewable for 3 years, and \nhave the ability to curb employer abuse by switching jobs. And in \naddition, after working 4 years, they can petition for a green card. So \nthe temporary worker program meets the labor needs of employers while \nat the same time remaining flexible enough to accommodate changes in \nthe marketplace.\n  Equally important is reducing the backlog of people who are waiting \nfor visas. Mr. President, 260,000 new family visas and 150,000 new \nemployment visas will be added each year. Thirty percent of the \nemployment visa pool will be reserved for essential workers. And \nperhaps most importantly, those currently waiting for visas will be \nprocessed before any of the current undocumented workers.\n  This is critical. When people talk about this somehow being an \namnesty, they are completely ignoring the 10 steps you have to go \nthrough--the last of which is the most important of all--that you go to \nthe end of the line. You don't somehow get a free pass card that \nautomatically puts you in; you go to the end of the line.\n  So the numbers of documented people are already there ahead of those \nwho are undocumented; and if you are coming in undocumented, you not \nonly have to learn English, have a health exam, and have a security \nbackground check, and you not only have to be legitimately employed and \nall these things, but you also go to the end of the line. That is not \nan amnesty.\n  The Judiciary Committee bill also provides a realistic way to deal \nwith the 11 million undocumented workers who are already here. Senator \nKennedy went through those 10 different steps. I will not repeat them \nnow, except to emphasize the last point I made about the back of the \nline.\n  I think those are pretty onerous burdens. They are tough burdens. \nThey require all back taxes to be paid--tough burdens. It is not \nforgive and forget. It is meet a standard. It is live up to a standard.\n  The final piece of the immigration reform puzzle is how do we create \na workable employer verification system. We don't want to, but we need \nto, unfortunately, rely on employers to be part of the system. We don't \nwant to turn them into immigration bureaucrats. We don't want to turn \nthem into police officers, but it is inevitable if we are going to have \na legitimate comprehensive system that when somebody presents \ncredentials to an employer, the employer can't cheat, the employer \ncan't look for a way around it.\n  The employer has to be part of this system of the values of America \nthat say there are people waiting in line, there are people going \nthrough the visa system. We are spending money on the border. We need \nyou to be part of this system. It is going to take an educational \neffort by chambers of commerce and small business associations and \nother efforts around the country so that there is an ethic in America \nthat is not willing to cheat. And if that ethic was put in place, we \nwould do more to stop illegal immigration than any other single item \nbecause people\n\n[[Page S2780]]\n\nwon't be able to find the work. I personally think it is the single \nmost important part, together with the Border Patrol component itself, \nof having a comprehensive immigration program.\n  Currently, however, employers don't have a reliable system for \nchecking the validity of Social Security numbers, and we know how many \nSocial Security numbers have been stolen. We have a problem for all \nAmericans with the theft of Social Security numbers. So we need to deal \nwith that problem even as we deal with this question of verification of \nemployees.\n  The Specter substitute creates a system that will enable employers to \nquickly and accurately verify a potential employee's legal status. The \nlast immigration reform we passed in 1986 was intended to address the \nroot causes of illegal workers coming across to the United States, but \nit failed to draw all the illegal workers out of the shadows, and that \nreally has helped lay the groundwork to people's cynicism and \nskepticism, which I understand, about today's system.\n  The reason we are in the crisis we are in today is because we have \nnever really been comprehensive. That is the problem. I believe the \nSpecter substitute amendment that the Judiciary Committee worked so \nhard to create and pass in a bipartisan fashion does not make the same \nmistake that was made in 1986.\n  There is one other aspect of the bill I would like to mention before \nyielding the floor. I have supported for many years the DREAM Act. The \nDREAM Act will enable young people who have spent most of their lives \nin the United States, who believe in our country and have stayed out of \ntrouble, to have a chance to get a crack at higher education, which is \nessential. It gives incredibly bright and capable young people a real \nchance at success, and it gives our country well-educated, hard-working \ncitizens. I think including the DREAM Act in comprehensive immigration \nreform makes sense, and I am pleased the Judiciary Committee, led by \nthe efforts of Senator Durbin, included it.\n  There are a number of amendments--I am not going to go into all of \nthem now--but there are a number of amendments on Border Patrol, making \nsure the Border Patrol agents have sufficient tools, GPS, other items. \nAlso, I want to eliminate the ability of the administration to have a \ncompletely unreviewable authority to make the full decision on an \nindividual's life. The Secretary of Homeland Security, the Attorney \nGeneral, and consular officials who currently have the sole and final \nauthority really will have an undue impact on detention, deportation, \ncitizenship determinations, and other issues. We need to somehow not \nhave concentrated power in so few hands.\n  In the end, the Specter bill is a comprehensive bill. It has the \nchance of bipartisan support. I think it is a courageous bill. I \ncongratulate the Chair and the members of the committee who fought so \nhard to come up with something under difficult circumstances, and I \nhope we are going to be able to get a chance to fix that bill and amend \nthat bill appropriately on the floor. I hope that will be the vehicle \nthe Senate proudly embraces as a reflection of the values of our \ncountry and the proper amount of respect for the history we have \ntraveled.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I begin by expressing my appreciation to \nthe Senator from Massachusetts for the kind things he has had to say \nabout the so-called Specter bill, the committee bill. But we can't move \nforward on legislating with that bill until there is an opportunity for \nMembers of the Senate to offer amendments. We do not have a system \nwhere a Senator, even Arlen Specter, offers a bill and it becomes the \nwill of the Senate, it is passed by the Senate without having Senators \nhaving an opportunity to offer amendments.\n  It appears now late on Tuesday afternoon, almost 4 o'clock, that \nthere is a calculated effort by some not to permit this bill to go \nforward.\n  We started on this bill on Wednesday afternoon, but we couldn't vote \non Thursday until we had sort of a bed check vote. That means one which \nwas going to be unanimous but not a meaningful incursion into the tough \nissues to try to start to work the will of the Senate. We had a vote at \n3 o'clock on Thursday afternoon, but all day Thursday, most of the day, \nwas consumed by debate and not very pointed debate, fairly generalized \ndebate which didn't advance the legislative process very much at all.\n  Then on Friday, the Senate was in session, but nobody was around. We \ncouldn't offer amendments because the other side of the aisle, the \nDemocrats, wouldn't permit us to.\n  Then yesterday we structured a couple of amendments on which there \nwas really no objection and voted on them pretty much pro forma.\n  We are searching for a way to bring up amendments to vote on today \nand couldn't do that. Then this morning, as the record will show, the \ndistinguished ranking member of the Judiciary Committee offered a \nunanimous consent request for speeches. When we discussed the matter, \nwe were told that there wouldn't be any opportunity for votes until the \nparty caucuses were finished.\n\n  So we twiddled our thumbs, bided our time until 2:30, and then the \nmajority leader called a meeting of Senate Republican Senators to try \nto find a compromise among disagreements within the Republican caucus. \nHe was waiting for a call back. Finally, we had word that the minority \nleader had a news conference, and this is what happened, in part, at \nthe news conference. I have a transcript.\n\n       Question: Senator Specter was very frustrated this morning \n     at a press conference, saying that work is not really being \n     done because the Democrats are not letting there be votes on \n     amendments, and he can't get agreement on votes on some of \n     the major amendments.\n       Could you tell us why it is that your strategy suggests--\n\n  And then an interruption by Senator Reid.\n\n       Maybe Arlen Specter has been so good at what he did in \n     committee that we shouldn't be worried about a lot of \n     amendments.\n\n  It would be nice if Arlen Specter was so good, we wouldn't have to \nworry about a lot of amendments. But let me confess, admit to the \ntotality of the circumstance, that I am not that good, or perhaps I am \nthat good, but my colleagues don't think I am that good and they want \nto offer amendments. Other Senators want to offer amendments to my \nbill, so that when Senator Reid says maybe he is so good we shouldn't \nbe worried about a lot of amendments, people want to offer amendments. \nTwo are on the floor now, Senator Kyl and Senator Cornyn.\n  Then there was a question by one of the reporters not identified:\n\n       But if the shoe was on the other foot, wouldn't you be \n     asking for your day on the floor?\n\n  Senator Reid:\n\n       The shoe's not on the other foot.\n\n  That is a pretty conclusive answer. A little while later in the press \nconference:\n\n       Senator Reid, Republicans are saying that you're not \n     allowing amendments to be voted on the floor. Is there a \n     reason for that?\n\n  Senator Reid:\n\n       Well, first of all, at my caucus I indicated to those \n     people there who are interested in understanding where the \n     amendments are, want to offer amendments, to talk to Senator \n     Leahy's staff, Senator Kennedy's staff, Senator Durbin's \n     staff. They're putting together all those amendments.\n       And we're happy to take a look at amendments that don't \n     damage the integrity of the bill. But if it's going to be, in \n     the estimation of the unified Democrats, an effort to \n     denigrate this bipartisan bill, then they won't have votes on \n     those amendments.\n\n  I have been around here a while, but I have a hard time understanding \nthat last sentence. I have a hard time understanding:\n\n       And we're happy to take a look at amendments that don't \n     damage the integrity of the bill.\n\n  The integrity of the bill under Senate procedures is established by \nvotes by Members on amendments. That is how you establish the integrity \nof the bill.\n  Then Senator Reid goes on:\n\n       But if it's going to be, in the estimation of the unified \n     Democrats, an effort to denigrate this bipartisan bill, then \n     they won't have votes on those amendments.\n\n  I don't believe there is the power or authority in any Senator or \ngroup of Senators to validate, conclude that what other Senators want \nto offer by way of amendment denigrates the bill and is the basis for \nnot having votes.\n  We have pending 100 amendments. It is an exact number. It just \nhappens to\n\n[[Page S2781]]\n\nbe 100 precisely. There are 6 amendments pending at the present time: \nSenator Frist on the study on border deaths; Senator Kyl on \nnonimmigrant work authorization; Senator Cornyn on a second-degree \namendment to Senator Kyl's amendment on nonimmigrant work \nauthorization; Senator Isakson on no guest worker program without \nborder security; Senator Mikulski on extension of returning worker \nexemption; Senator Dorgan on Canada travel without passport.\n  There had been a suggestion that we would vote on Senator Kyl's \namendment side by side with an amendment by the Democrats. Although I \nbelieve such an amendment has been produced by the Democrats, they are \nunwilling to permit us to vote on it side by side.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for the purpose of a \nunanimous consent request?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I will on the condition that I do not \nlose my right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, to verify what the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee has just said, I ask unanimous consent that we proceed to the \nregular order for a vote on amendment No. 3206, which is the amendment \nI offered last Friday to which Senator Specter just referred. There is \na second-degree amendment that was offered by Senator Cornyn, and there \nis the text of an amendment that I have possession of that was, I \nbelieve, produced by Senator Kennedy that would be the Democrat side-\nby-side amendment, and we could vote on that amendment after the vote \non the second-degree amendment and my amendment No. 3206. So we can \ndetermine right now whether the Democratic leadership is preventing us \nfrom having votes on amendments, such as the amendment that I filed \nlast Friday.\n  I ask unanimous consent that we proceed to the regular order and that \nmy amendment No. 3206 then be pending and proceed to a vote on that \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, will the chairman of the Judiciary Committee \nyield for the purpose of my propounding another unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I so yield on the stipulation I not lose my right to the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, this unanimous consent request is simply to \nsend to the desk amendment No. 3246, an amendment that Senator Cornyn \nand I would like to send to the desk.\n  Mr. REID. What is the question?\n  Mr. KYL. To lay aside the current business and send to the desk \namendment No. 3246.\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  Mr. KYL. There is objection heard to that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I renew the unanimous consent request by \nthe Senator from Arizona, Mr. Kyl, for a vote on his pending amendment \nat 4:30 p.m.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I renew the unanimous consent request by \nthe Senator from Arizona for a vote on his amendment at 5 o'clock.\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I renew the request of the Senator from Arizona for a \nvote on his amendment at midnight.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. We are witnessing here a new procedure in the Senate that I \nam not familiar with, and that is legislating by press conference.\n  What we have before the Senate now is a rare moment of \nbipartisanship. We have a bill that came from the Judiciary Committee \nin a bipartisan fashion. It is strong bipartisan legislation that \nstrengthens our national security. We need to move forward.\n  We have reviewed the list of amendments filed by both sides. There \nare several good-faith amendments that are intended to improve the bill \nwithout damaging the integrity of the committee product or which are \nnot designed to score political points. We are ready to schedule votes \non these amendments at the right time.\n  However, it is important that we take advantage of the bipartisan \nmomentum behind this bill and keep moving forward. We must not allow \nthis strong bipartisan legislation to be torpedoed for reasons that \nprobably are very partisan. We on this side are united behind a \ncomprehensive immigration reform bill, a bill that is bipartisan, and \nwe are ready for prompt action on this bill. So I object to voting at \nmidnight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may \nproceed with a colloquy with the distinguished Democratic leader, \nwithout losing my right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I very much appreciate the high \ncompliment by the Senator from Nevada to this superb bipartisan bill \ncrafted by Senator Leahy and myself, and I wish to see the bill passed. \nI have worked very hard on it, including a marathon markup last Monday.\n  May I ask the Senator from Nevada when is the right time to consider \namendments?\n  Mr. REID. As I said, Mr. President, staffs are looking at it. It is \nmy understanding there are 70 to 100 amendments that have been filed; \nis that right?\n  Mr. SPECTER. One hundred.\n  Mr. REID. We are in the process of looking at those. As you have to \ndo on any bill, you have to decide, when you have a bill that is as \nlarge as this, what amendments are going to be decided to be voted \nupon. It can't be decided on one side; it has to be decided by both \nsides. The only way we are going to get votes on amendments on this \nmost important bill is to have both sides agree on them, and we are in \nthe process of doing that right now.\n  I indicated--as the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania \nindicated--in my caucus today, I said that staff would be working just \nas I outlined. It can't be done in 5 minutes or 10 minutes; it will \ntake a little bit of time. But this is an important bill. It deals with \nour national security, it deals with a guest worker program, and it \ndeals with a path to legalization for 11 million or so people.\n  I will say to my friend, the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, that I think the work the Judiciary Committee did on this \npiece of legislation is extraordinary. It is good. Frankly, I was very \npleasantly surprised at the complexity of the bill and how good it was. \nI like the bill as it is. That is my personal feeling. So I am willing, \nas I have indicated, to work with Senator Leahy and his staff, Senator \nKennedy and his staff, Senator Durbin and his staff, and we will look \nat these amendments and see if we can agree on a bipartisan basis what \namendments should be decided here--or voted upon, I should say.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, will the distinguished chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee yield for a question, please?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I do, on the condition that I don't lose my right to the \nfloor.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I think I misspoke a while ago and talked \nabout the amendment that I introduced last Friday--actually, it was \nlast Thursday--that Senator Cornyn and I, and I believe Senator George \nAllen is a cosponsor--introduced, amendment No. 3206.\n  My question to the chairman is this: In the bill, there is a variety \nof benefits that are provided to illegal immigrants who are in the \nUnited States today in that they are allowed to gain a legal status \nwhich can lead to legal permanent residency, sometimes called a green \ncard, from which one can apply for citizenship. There are some \nconditions attached to that. Is it not correct that the amendment \nSenator Cornyn and I offered simply adds to those requirements, or \nthose benefits, the additional requirement that the individual\n\n[[Page S2782]]\n\nseeking the benefit not have been convicted of a felony or three \nmisdemeanors, or have violated a judge's order of departure from the \nUnited States?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the statement made by the Senator from \nArizona is correct.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, to the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, \nin your view, is that an amendment that is germane and relevant and \nvery specific in that it would add one more requirement to the \nconditions that are allowed--with the benefits--that are allowed under \nthe bill, and would it be your view that in no way would that be a \nnongermane or nonrelevant kind of amendment?\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I would respond in the affirmative. I \nwould add that this isn't an amendment which, in Senator Reid's words, \ndenigrates this bipartisan bill. I would say it enhances the bill.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, if I could ask another question. As you know, \nthere have been some competing bills filed, perhaps the two most \ncomprehensive being the bill that was worked on in the committee and \nthat came out of the committee in an amended form, and a bill Senator \nCornyn and I introduced which, when introduced, was far more \ncomprehensive, but some of the provisions of our bill were added to the \nbill that came out of the Judiciary Committee. Would it be your view it \nwould be entirely appropriate for the Members of the Senate to have an \nopportunity to vote on the bill Senator Cornyn and I introduced and, \ntherefore, that we ought to be given an opportunity to lay down our \nbill, an opportunity which would be denied if we continue this exercise \nof having objections to unanimous consent requests to lay down \namendments?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the Senator from Arizona asks something \nthat is preeminently correct, and that is the way the Senate functions. \nSenators have a right to offer amendments, and the so-called Kyl-Cornyn \nbill is the product of very extensive thinking, analysis, and \npreparation. A good part of it was incorporated into the chairman's \nmark. And certainly Senator Kyl and Senator Cornyn are within their \nrights in asking for a vote on it.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, if I could ask a final question of the \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee. Notwithstanding the fact that \nthrough your good offices a bill was shepherded through the committee, \na bill which you support and are prepared to vote on and vote for, it \nwould be your view that a denial of our opportunity to offer an \namendment as an alternative would be improper and inappropriate and an \nobstructionist tactic to prevent the Senate from working its will in \nhaving an opportunity to consider differing points of view on this \nimportant and complex subject?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, yes.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I would, again, on the condition that I don't lose my \nright to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). Without objection.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask the distinguished chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee if the offering of amendments during the course of \na bill's consideration on the floor is the usual procedure to determine \nwhere consensus lies and in determining what the will of the Senate \nultimately is, and whether the refusal of the Democrats to allow votes \non these amendments is obstructing the work of the Senate?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the answer is decisively, obviously, yes.\n  Mr. CORNYN. And, Mr. President, if the Senator would yield for \nanother question.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I do, on the same condition.\n  Mr. CORNYN. We are running up against a Friday deadline with a 2-week \nrecess of the Senate long standing, and if we are unsuccessful in \nallowing any votes on amendments which are necessary to move this bill \nforward, where do you believe the blame would lie for the Senate's \ninability to successfully finish its work this week on this \ncomprehensive border security and immigration reform bill?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I would respond by saying the blame would \nlie with those who have lodged objections to very reasonable unanimous \nconsent requests, several of which we have heard here this afternoon.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, if the Senator would yield for a final \nquestion.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I do, on the same condition.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Isn't it true that this bill for the first time manifests \na tremendous Federal commitment to live up to the Federal Government's \nresponsibility to provide additional Border Patrol agents and \nadditional technology along the border to enable the United States of \nAmerica to finally secure its borders and potentially prevent the \nincursion of criminals, even terrorists, and that each day that goes \nby, because of our inability to complete our business here on the \nfloor, potentially exposes the country to further jeopardy in that \nregard?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, my answer to that question is in the \naffirmative.\n  Mr. President, proceeding with the discussion with the distinguished \nSenator from Nevada, the Democratic leader, when he says there would be \nvotes at the right time, the Kyl-Cornyn amendment was filed last \nThursday. I agree with him that it takes time to analyze amendments, \nbut hasn't there been sufficient time for the Kyl-Cornyn amendment to \nbe analyzed and to enable the Democrats on the opposition or a side-by-\nside amendment, or whatever course they choose, to come forward and let \nus proceed?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, responding to my friend, it seems quite \nunusual that these crocodile tears are being poured out now because \namendments aren't being considered. We have waited for years to have an \namendment considered on raising the minimum wage. We have waited months \nand months to have a debate on amendments on stem cell research. I have \ntrouble accepting the plaintive cries from the other side of the aisle \nin not having their amendments heard. With this Republican-dominated \nSenate, we have been unable to offer amendments, only two of which I \nhave mentioned. We have tried and tried and tried.\n  This is the Senate, and we have 100 amendments pending. And the mere \nfact that the distinguished junior Senator from Arizona offers an \namendment he believes strongly in does not mean it takes precedence \nover the other 100 amendments that have been offered. This is a \nprocedure that has been followed for many years.\n  I would further say I simply don't accept the explanation of the \namendment the distinguished junior Senator from Arizona has offered on \nthis bill. First, the Kyl amendment, as amended by Senator Cornyn, \nwould make classes--various individuals who would become part of a \nclass of undocumented immigrants--ineligible for conditional \nnonimmigrant status and to earn their legalization; for example, \nimmigrants who came through the visa program who overstayed their \nvisas. Is that what we want to do? I don't want to do it: Make \nimmigrants subject to expedited removal at the point of arrival. And \ndid you know one of the definitions of aggravated felon that is in this \nlegislation is somebody who has twice overstayed their visa?\n  So I like the bill we have before the Senate. I don't accept this \namendment--the Kyl amendment--as one that improves the bill. It hurts \nthe bill. It hurts the very foundation and what I believe is the spirit \nof this legislation.\n  I do not accept the fact that this good legislation which is now \nbefore the Senate will be improved by the Kyl amendment as modified by \nthe amendment of the distinguished Presiding Officer. I believe the \nbill before us is a good bill and we should stick with it. That is what \nI want to do.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the response--or the words spoken; it was \nnot a response--the words spoken by the distinguished Democratic leader \nare interesting, but they do not answer the question. The question was, \nhave you had enough time to take a position on the Kyl amendment? And \nyour analysis--\n  Mr. REID. The answer to the distinguished Senator is yes, I have had \ntime.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Wait a minute. I am speaking here, and I will not \ninterrupt you, Senator Reid.\n\n[[Page S2783]]\n\n  Mr. REID. I apologize very much.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Your analysis states that you had enough time to analyze \nit, review it, and you are opposed to it. When you mention stem cells, \nyou are right. We should have voted on stem cells some time ago. I \nthink I have complained more than you have about that. And you are \nright about the minimum wage. It ought to be raised. And I think you \nvoted for it every time, but no more often than I have.\n  But we are now faced with the immigration bill. When you say that the \nKyl amendment will not improve the immigration bill, my question to you \nis, isn't the way you express that by voting against it, by leading the \ncharge against it, as opposed to preventing a vote on it? Isn't that \nthe way the Senate functions?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, with all due respect to the distinguished \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, he has been in this body a lot \nlonger than I have, but I still understand the rules of the Senate. At \nthis stage, as a Senator from the State of Nevada, I am not ready to \nmove forward on the Kyl amendment. I do not have to explain in any more \ndetail than I have why I do not want to move forward on it. I do not \nagree with the amendment. I don't think it is going to benefit this \nlegislation pending before the Senate. I am going to do what I can to \nprevent a vote on it. I can't be more direct than that to the \ndistinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SPECTER. In a moment I will, to Senator Leahy.\n  When the Senator from Nevada says he doesn't have to explain, he is \nwrong. He thinks he does have to explain because this is a Senate \nproceeding by press conference. The Senator from Nevada accurately \ncharacterized some of the legislative process on this bill as \nlegislation by press conference. Of course that has never happened \nbefore. I mean, it would just be antithetical to the workings of the \nSenate.\n  It is hard to walk down that corridor without holding a press \nconference involuntarily. You either hold a press conference or you are \nrude.\n  I can't do more by way of gesturing without drawing an objection from \nSenator Byrd. I once acknowledged the presence of the Penn State \nnational champions in the gallery, and it was found by the rules that I \nwas out of line.\n  But we do this all the time, and sometimes by design. A microphone is \nset up there frequently, and we go there voluntarily, and we utilize \nthe ink and electronic equipment of the media. This little discussion \nhere--more accurately called a charade--is for the media because we \nwant to put some pressure on the Democrats to let us vote.\n  Senator Reid has come out here to defend his position because he \nthinks he has to, because if he didn't think he had to, he wouldn't be \nhere. He is too parsimonious with his time, which is very valuable. I \ndaresay he has a long list of calls to return and a long list of calls \nto make and a lot of business to transact, and he came out to the floor \nbecause he thought he needed to state his position that there is a \nbattle and that he is defending himself against the charge that the \nDemocrats are stalling and holding up this bill.\n  It is late now. It is 4:20 on Tuesday afternoon. We only have--let's \nsee--we only have Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. We \nonly have 5 days in this week to finish this bill.\n  I yield to the Senator from Vermont with the stipulation that I don't \nlose my right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator from Vermont is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. As the Senator from Pennsylvania knows better than anyone \nhere, we can accomplish a great deal when we are able to work together. \nHe and I and key members of the Republican Party and the Democratic \nParty worked very closely in the Judiciary Committee to report a \nbipartisan piece of legislation to the full Senate.\n  We reported a bipartisan bill, and I would like to vote on that. Here \non the floor, we have voted on several amendments. We voted on the \nFrist amendment, the Bingaman amendment, the Alexander amendment. A \nMikulski amendment is pending, which I believe could pass. We hope the \nother side will consent to take up Senator Nelson's amendment. Senator \nBrownback and Senator Lieberman have an amendment on detention and \nasylum. There is a Collins amendment, a Republican amendment on \nathletes; a Bond amendment; and another Republican amendment on natural \nscience graduate students. Each one could be offered and voted on. \nThere are a number of others we are working on.\n  I made a suggestion this morning to ask unanimous consent that \nSenators be allowed to talk about amendments they planned to offer. A \nDemocratic Senator might speak for 15 minutes and then alternate with \nthe Republican side, and so on, back and forth. The junior Senator from \nArizona objected to that proposal. He has an absolute right, of course, \nto object.\n  I hoped that if Senators could come here and talk about amendments \nthey hoped to offer, we might be able to work out some amendments in \nthe usual way.\n  Up until the last few years, when there has been single-party control \nin Washington, we were always able to share one side's amendments with \nthe other, to see if there were areas of compromise. We would work out \na schedule on complicated bills like this one. Certainly, this is the \npractice followed by the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania in \ncommittee. Because he ran it in such a fair way, and because Senators \non both sides of the aisle were able to discuss their amendments, the \ndistinguished Senator from Pennsylvania and the full committee were \nable to report a bipartisan bill. Unfortunately, we seem to have lost \nthe ability to do that here.\n  If we could go back to the traditional manner of doing things, the \nbetter way of doing things, practices similar to those followed by the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Pennsylvania, we could get somewhere.\n  As I said, we have already adopted a number of amendments. This is \nthe practice I was suggesting when I received an objection this \nmorning. I was hoping to set up a series of votes.\n  I am not suggesting that the Senator from Arizona was not within his \nrights. Of course, he was within his rights to object. But once he did, \nwe lost the ability to set up that procedure which, I believe, in my \nown experience, would have let some amendments go through.\n  The distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania has been more than \ngenerous. The Senator from Pennsylvania has the floor. I yield to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. KYL. Will the Senator from Pennsylvania yield for a question to \nme without giving up his right to the floor?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I do. I will have a comment to make about what Senator \nLeahy has had to say, but first I will yield to the Senator from \nArizona on the condition that I do not lose my right to the floor.\n  Mr. KYL. I appreciate that. Because the Senator from Vermont referred \nto me and referred to my objection earlier today, let me ask the \nSenator, the chairman of the committee, is it not correct that my \nunanimous consent request this morning, in response to his, was that \nthe two Senators from Florida be allowed to address the achievement of \ntheir Gators basketball team while the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, and any other \nmembers of leadership who needed to be a part of it, begin discussing \nexactly what the Senator from Vermont just now was saying needed to be \ndiscussed--namely, the order of speakers and the order of amendments \nthat would be considered? And is it not further true that the \nDemocratic side said that could be done only after the two lunches that \nwould conclude sometime around 2:15 this afternoon? So it was not my \nobjection to the speaking order request of the Senator from Vermont \nthat precluded him or anyone else from discussing with you or anyone \nelse the proper order of speaking or offering of amendments or voting \non amendments; is that not correct?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the Senator from Arizona accurately \nstates the situation.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, may I ask another question of the chairman of \nthe committee?\n\n[[Page S2784]]\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Under the same condition.\n  Mr. KYL. Given the fact that the distinguished minority leader has, I \nam sure unintentionally, but nonetheless mischaracterized my amendment, \nNo. 3246, wouldn't it be a better process to understand the nature of \nthe amendments to discuss them and to debate them under the regular \norder and then have a vote up or down rather than through the process \nwe are undertaking right now, which is at best a very indirect approach \nto discussion and in any event doesn't lead to a vote up or down on the \namendments?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the Senator from Arizona is correct. That \nis the way the Senate functions under our rules.\n  Mr. KYL. Finally, one final question, Mr. President, to the chairman \nof the Judiciary Committee. Is it not true that one of the critical \nelements of the legislation we are considering right now has yet to be \nadded to the bill because the jurisdiction was felt to be in the \nFinance Committee and that the amendment, which would become a separate \ntitle of the bill dealing with employee eligibility verification, has \nyet to be offered as an amendment and clearly will need to be offered \nas an amendment, debated, considered, and hopefully approved before any \nlegislation that purports to be comprehensive immigration reform could \nbe voted on and passed by this body?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, again, the Senator from Arizona \naccurately states the situation.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, will the Senator from Pennsylvania yield \nfor another question?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I do under the same condition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, let's be factual here. The suggestion was \nmade by the Senator from Vermont that we have an order of speakers on \nboth sides. These would be Senators who have amendments that they want \nto offer. They would discuss them on the floor with the idea that \nperhaps a bipartisan group could meet after the caucus meetings and \ntalk about how we might sequence the amendments. I would note, however, \nfor the Senators here, the meeting after the caucus was a closed-door \nmeeting to which only Republicans were invited.\n  It is somewhat difficult to schedule Republican or Democratic \namendments in such a meeting. This one-sided meeting was completely \ndifferent than the business meetings the Senator from Pennsylvania held \nin the Judiciary Committee, which were successful in getting a bill to \nthe floor.\n  I urge the Republican and Democratic leaders to look at the model \nfollowed by the Senator from Pennsylvania in committee, which reported \na bill to the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Vermont is \ncorrect. We did have a closed-door meeting with only Republican \nSenators present. I know they have a superior procedure among the \nDemocrats and never have a closed meeting where only Democratic \nSenators are present. I know there is an operational rule where at \nleast one Republican Senator has to be present whenever the Democrats \nmeet.\n  That is supposed to be a laugh line.\n  Of course we meet with only Republicans. When the distinguished \nSenator from Vermont, the distinguished ranking member, was commenting \nearlier about missing the St. Patrick's Day recess, I seldom disagree \nwith him, but I have to say by way of addendum that he forgot to \nmention that we missed the August recess preparing for the confirmation \nof Chief Justice Roberts. He didn't mention that we missed the December \nrecess preparing for the confirmation hearing of Justice Alito. He \ndidn't mention that we missed the January recess because of the \nJudiciary Committee hearing on Justice Alito. While our colleagues took \na little time off in August to meet with constituents and work with \nperhaps a little play, they had December off, they had January off--not \nthe Judiciary Committee. We were working. So there was not anything \nunusual about the St. Patrick's Day recess to find the Judiciary \nCommittee at work. The staff worked very late hours. Then we scheduled \na markup on the day before the recess ended, when the custom is to come \nback very late on Monday.\n  The Senator from Vermont had to leave his cherished farm to come to \nWashington Sunday night to be here early Monday morning for our \nsession.\n  We were given an impossible job to finish the bill on Monday. We \nsurprised a lot of people. We did it.\n  Then there was a little consternation about what to do next. The \ncommittee bill is on the floor, and it is a good bill, but it is not a \nperfect bill. Even if it were a perfect bill, it would still be subject \nto amendment, and ultimately we will get to it.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield without his losing \nthe floor?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, consistent with not losing the floor, \nwhen are we going to vote on these amendments?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, of course the Senator from Pennsylvania and \nthe Senator from Vermont were both here, missing all those recesses. As \nmuch as I have enjoyed the company of my friend for over a quarter of a \ncentury, I did not enjoy it so much that I wanted to miss those \nrecesses. There are several amendments that we could vote on in the \nnext couple of hours, as far as I am concerned. I would be happy to do \nthat.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Starting at 6:30?\n  Mr. LEAHY. No, starting right now. We have one pending. I mentioned \nthat several Senators, including a majority of Senators from the \nRepublican side of the aisle, have amendments that we could be voting \non.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we proceed \nto a vote on the Kyl amendment at 4:40.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I object.\n  Will the chairman yield for a question without losing the floor?\n  Mr. SPECTER. On the same condition.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Let me commend the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. \nIt is the hardest working committee on Capitol Hill. I am glad I am on \nit. I look at others and they seem to have a lot of time off and we \ndon't. I am a member of that committee. I respect the chairman for all \nwe have done and tried to do in a short period of time.\n\n       Let me say to the chairman that I am troubled by one of his \n     comments during the course of this conversation. That was the \n     comment that what Senator Kyl seeks to do would improve the \n     bill. I would suggest to the chairman that a careful review \n     of the Kyl amendment will find that it defeats the purpose of \n     a major portion of this bill.\n\n  If that is the intent--to strip from this bill a path to \nlegalization--then I think it is a much different bill than the one \nwhich we approved 12 to 6 out of our committee, a bill which the \nchairman supported and which I supported on a bipartisan basis, and \nwhich Senator Kyl of Arizona opposed.\n  Let me be specific. The Kyl-Cornyn amendment which they are seeking \nto bring to the floor eliminates the path to legalization for \npotentially millions of undocumented immigrants who have committed no \ncrime. It eliminates it from this bill. It creates a condition for \nqualification to be eligible for that path that would be, frankly, \nimpossible for many to meet. Let me tell you what I mean.\n  I ask the chairman if he would still believe this improves the bill. \nProponents of the Kyl-Cornyn amendment claim that the Judiciary \nCommittee bill would allow criminals to become permanent residents. I \nthink the chairman knows, as most people do, that the bill expressly \nlays out in specific words those crimes which would disqualify a person \nfrom a path to legalization. I could go through this long list, but I \nwill not, other than to tell you that every crime of moral turpitude, \nand many others, would disqualify one from this legal pathway.\n  What the Kyl-Cornyn amendment really does is undermine the earned \ncitizenship program in the bill. It prevents potentially millions who \nare in the United States from applying for legal status because of \nstatus violations and not crimes. The vast majority of undocumented \nimmigrants who would be affected by the Kyl-Cornyn amendment are not \ncriminals but rather the exact classes of immigrants which we intended \nto help with title VI of the Judiciary Committee bill.\n  Our analysis of the Department of Homeland Security data shows that \nover 95 percent of the people who would be affected by the Kyl-Cornyn \namendment have committed no crime. The\n\n[[Page S2785]]\n\nonly crime they have committed is the fact that they are undocumented \nin America today.\n  I ask the chairman how it would improve the bill to remove the path \nfor legalization for 95 percent of the people who would be affected by \nthe Kyl-Cornyn amendment. If the Kyl-Cornyn amendment passes, the \nUnited States will still have a crisis of illegality, and we will not \nhave what we hoped in the committee, a balanced approach which allows \nthose who are currently here a long, arduous but legal way to reach \ntheir citizenship at some point in their lives.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I feel complimented that the \ndistinguished Senator from Illinois has only disagreed with one thing I \nhave said, because I have said quite a few things. If that implies that \nhe agrees with the other things I have said, then he agrees with quite \na lot of what I have said.\n  With respect to the specific, yes. I don't believe that the Kyl-\nCornyn amendment would destroy the bill as characterized by the Senator \nfrom Illinois.\n  Let me add that the Senator from Illinois is a member of the \ncommittee and has been a very active and contributory member of the \ncommittee, and the committee has accomplished quite a lot because of \nthe cooperation of Senator Durbin, Senator Leahy, and other Democrats \nand Republicans. It has been a very hard-working committee.\n  It is my hope to expedite the process of working on the bill. For \nthat purpose, I am going to again ask unanimous consent that we vote on \nthe Kyl amendment now.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, in order to try to bring the Senators to \nthe floor to move along, I move----\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question before \nhe does that?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I do.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, if I could ask this question of the chairman \nof the committee because the Senator from Illinois just made a comment \nabout what the pending amendment would do. The pending amendment \nspecifies that a person who has committed a felony or three or four \nmisdemeanors would be ineligible to participate in the program. The \nSenator from Illinois knows that under existing law people convicted of \ncrimes of moral turpitude, certain drug offenses, and other multiple \ncrimes are already prohibited from participating in the program.\n  But I ask the chairman of the committee if I may lay this predicate \nfor the question: The INS Attorney Manual provides Department of \nHomeland Security attorneys with random examples of crimes that have \nbeen held not to be crimes of moral turpitude by the Board of \nImmigration Appeals and, therefore, whether this sample list of crimes \nwould be excluded from the bill that came out of the Judiciary \nCommittee and, therefore, people who have committed crimes such as this \nwould still be eligible to participate in the program and be put on the \npath to citizenship.\n  The sample includes burglary, loan sharking, involuntary \nmanslaughter, assault and battery, possession of an unregistered sawed-\noff shotgun, riot, kidnaping, certain types not involving ransom, \nmaking false statements to a U.S. agency, contributing to the \ndelinquency of a minor, abandonment of a minor child, alien smuggling, \nreentry after deportation, draft evasion, desertion from the Armed \nForces, contempt of Congress, and contempt of court.\n  Many of these decisions, according to the manual, involve fines, \ndistinctions of the technical element of state or foreign companies and \nsometimes crimes which are defined as crimes of moral turpitude.\n  That list goes to the specific crimes in the statute. You would have \nto determine whether a crime of moral turpitude was involved in order \nto know whether the individual would be permitted to take advantage of \nthe underlying bill.\n  If an individual has committed a felony or three or four \nmisdemeanors, under the amendment we have filed they would be \nineligible.\n  I ask the chairman of the committee whether it would be wise public \npolicy for someone who has committed a felony and has been convicted of \ncommitting a felony or three or four misdemeanors should participate in \nthe program which would ultimately lead to citizenship.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I respond to the Senator's question by \nsaying I think he has articulated sound public policy, and I support \nhis amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3206\n\n  I now call for the regular order with respect to Kyl amendment No. \n3206.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  The amendment is now pending.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, in moving to table the Kyl amendment, \nwhich I am about to do, I do so only to bring the Senators to the floor \nto try to move the process along. I intend to vote against tabling the \nKyl amendment, but I do so, to repeat, to try to get the process \nmoving. I like what the distinguished ranking member said about his \nwillingness to start the votes soon. I hope we can move to that \nprocedure.\n  I move to table Kyl amendment No. 3206. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, if I may direct a question to the Senator \nfrom Illinois, the assistant minority leader, does he wish to have \nSenator Reid speak before we vote on the amendment?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes, I do.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we await \nSenator Reid's arrival to speak on the amendment and that we then vote \non the motion to table.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, before we do that, I believe the \ndistinguished Senator from Connecticut wishes to speak.\n  Mr. SPECTER. May I amend my unanimous consent request? May we limit \nthe time to 30 minutes equally divided, and at the end of the 30 \nminutes we go to a vote on my motion to table the Kyl amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: Were the yeas and \nnays ordered on this vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, they were.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The minority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I apologize for being late. I was occupied \nwhen Senator Specter started talking about an event that I had out in \nthe hall, and I thought it was important I come back to the floor. I \ncame to spend a few minutes talking about some of his assertions.\n  But now what I want to focus on for a minute--Senator Kyl stood and \ntold the merits of his amendment, with a very brief outline he gave.\n  Senators Kyl and Cornyn claim the Judiciary Committee bill would \nallow criminals to become residents. This simply is not true. The \nJudiciary Committee bill, like the McCain-Kennedy bill upon which it is \nbased, already denies earned legalization to broad categories of aliens \nwho have committed crimes or are a security risk to our country. \nImmigrants denied legalization include--and this is only a partial \nlist--immigrants convicted of ``crimes of moral turpitude: aggravated \nassault, assault with a deadly weapon, fraud, larceny, and forgery; \nimmigrants convicted of controlled substance offenses: sale, \npossession, and distribution of drugs, drug trafficking; immigrants \nconvicted of theft offenses, including shoplifting; immigrants \nconvicted of public nuisance offenses; immigrants with multiple \ncriminal convictions; immigrants convicted of crimes of violence; \nimmigrants convicted of counterfeiting, bribery, or perjury; immigrants \nconvicted of murder, rape, or sexual abuse of a minor; immigrants \nconvicted of espionage or sabotage; immigrants believed to have engaged \nin terrorist activity, which is broadly defined; immigrants with any \nassociation with terrorist activity or representatives of a terrorist \norganization; spouses and children of individuals who\n\n[[Page S2786]]\n\nare inadmissible as a terrorist; immigrants known to have acted in ways \nthat are deemed to have adverse foreign policy consequences.''\n  What the Kyl-Cornyn amendment does is undermine the earned \ncitizenship program in the committee bill, which I strongly believe in. \nIt would prevent millions of Mexicans, Central Americans, Irish, and \nother nationals from applying for legal status because of status \nviolations, not crimes. The vast majority of undocumented immigrants \nwho would be affected by this amendment are not criminal aliens but, \nrather, the exact classes of immigrants intended to be covered by title \nVI of the Judiciary Committee bill.\n  Our analysis shows that over 95 percent of the people potentially \naffected by this amendment are individuals whose only crime--and \n``crime'' is very loosely construed for purposes of this discussion--is \nbeing in the United States out of status--95 percent.\n  If the Kyl-Cornyn amendment passes, the United States will still \nconfront a crisis of illegality and it will deny the will of the \nAmerican people, three out of four of who favor earned legalization for \nimmigrants who work, pay their taxes, learn English, and stay out of \ntrouble.\n  This bill before this body is a very fine piece of legislation. It \nsets a very strict standard to protect our national security. Our \nborders will be protected better than they have ever been protected. It \nwill allow places such as Las Vegas, NV--and Las Vegas is not the only \nplace. They are going to build within the next few years, 4 to 5 years, \n50,000 new hotel rooms. They will need a minimum of 100,000 new \nworkers. This legislation will allow that to happen. There are places \nall over America that are faced not with numbers that are as huge as \nthat but with big numbers.\n  Finally, what this legislation that is now before the Senate does is \nit allows 11 million-plus people not to have to live in the shadows of \nAmerica. It is a path to earned legalization--not like the old amnesty \nthat was done when I served in the House of Representatives--but a path \ntoward legalization. Stay out of trouble. Pay your taxes. Have a job. \nLearn English. Go to the back of the line.\n  We are here trying to protect the integrity of a bill that is \nbipartisan in nature and one of the best things to happen to this \npartisan atmosphere we find ourselves in. It is a bipartisan bill. Last \nweek, we stood on this floor--and I do not think ``boasted'' is the \nright word--and talked about how good it was we were able to pass a \nbipartisan bill that improved the situation dealing with the ethics of \nthis body and this country. Why can't we continue on a bipartisan basis \non this committee-reported bill?\n  So for individuals to come to this floor and think we are doing \nsomething that is anti-Senate, anti-American, because we do not want to \nvote on an amendment that I think guts this bill does not mean there is \nanything wrong with those of us who believe this is what we should not \ndo. And it does not take away from the good faith of my friend from \nArizona. He thinks he is doing the right thing. I disagree with him a \nlot. I think what he is doing is wrong. I think it hurts this bill. And \nI am going to do everything I can to protect this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me yield some time to myself.\n  With all due respect, I disagree with my colleague, who has said the \namendment would deny most of the people whom the bill is intended to \nbenefit the benefits of the bill; namely, legal permanent residency and \ncitizenship.\n  That is only true if most of the people who are supposed to receive \nbenefits under the bill have committed a felony or three misdemeanors \nor have violated a court order to leave the country when they have been \nordered to do so, or have not complied with a prior order of the DHS to \ndepart if they are not eligible to participate in the program.\n  These are not the people we should be seeking to give the benefits of \nthe program to. These are precisely the people who have demonstrated \neither they are criminals or that when you have given them the chance \nto comply with an immigration order, they have refused to do so. I do \nnot think the Senator intended to say these are exactly the people we \nwant to benefit under this program.\n  There are two large classes of people who would be potentially denied \nthe benefits of the program by our amendment. The first is, instead of \nreferring to crimes of moral turpitude or violation of a crime relating \nto a controlled substance--which are the two specific categories in the \nbill--we say any felony or three misdemeanors.\n  And examples of crimes, as I said before, that are not covered by the \ncontrolled substance or moral turpitude sections are: burglary; loan \nsharking; involuntary manslaughter; assault and battery; possession of \nan unregistered sawed-off shotgun; riot; kidnaping; abandonment of a \nminor child; alien smuggling; reentry after deportation, as I said; \ndraft evasion; desertion from the Armed Forces; and others. These are \ncrimes that would not be picked up in the pending bill.\n  So while it is true some crimes are covered and, therefore, some \ncriminals would not get the benefits called for in this pending \nlegislation, it is also true many others who have committed these other \nkinds of crimes would not in any way be restricted from participating \nin the benefits of the law.\n  The second group is those who have committed immigration violations, \nnot just people who are in some status violation. Let me make that \ncrystal clear. It is not simply because you overstayed your visa. There \nare only two categories here. You have not complied with a prior \nDepartment order and, therefore, are not eligible to participate in the \nprogram.\n  In the hearing, by the way, of our subcommittee, we showed that \nbetween 80 and 85 percent of those released on bail failed to appear \nand comply with removal orders. Clearly, this has to demonstrate a \ndisrespect for orders from immigration courts and should not be allowed \nto continue. These are exactly the kind of people you do not want to be \nparticipating in the program because they have already demonstrated a \nwillingness to violate immigration law after being ordered to do so.\n  Secondly, those who have not only failed to depart after being \nordered--they have entered illegally, but that is not what we are \ntalking about here. Entering illegally does not count under this \namendment to deny them benefits. Rather, you have to have done that and \nbeen ordered by the court to depart as a result of some violation and \nfurther refused to comply with the judge's order.\n  So this is not just a status violation. Merely coming here illegally \nwould not be covered by this amendment, period. You would have to \ncommit a felony--been convicted of a felony, three misdemeanors, or \nhave intentionally violated an order of the court to depart after \nhaving been ordered to do so by the court.\n  I think what this amendment does is to make it crystal clear that the \nintention of the Senate is that people participating in the program not \nbe convicted criminals or people who have deliberately violated a court \norder dealing with departure from the United States.\n  It is interesting that most of the language we took came from the \n1986 bill, and for some reason that language was omitted from the bill \nthat is pending before the Senate. So it seems to me if we are going to \nat least get to most of the people we would not want to participate in \nthis program, we would want to deny that right to those who have \ncommitted serious crimes, such as the ones I have articulated here.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I wish to take the time allocated to me to \naddress the larger issue of this bill; although, clearly, the amendment \nbeing offered by our colleagues from Arizona and Texas impacts the \nlarger question: the decision of whether we deal with a part or the \nwhole of the immigration issue.\n  You can make a case, obviously, that by just dealing with border \nsecurity issues, you are dealing with an important and essential \nelement of immigration reform. I would quickly argue that if you just \ndeal with border security\n\n[[Page S2787]]\n\nand do not also deal with the phenomena of 11 million people who are \nhere illegally, you would only be addressing half of the issue--a \nlegitimate half of the issue--without any kind of recourse or plan on \nhow you ultimately deal with the fact that we have 11 to 12 million \npeople who are here under an illegal status.\n  So I appreciate the work of my colleague from Arizona, and I would be \nurging colleagues to vote no on the motion to table because I think we \nought to have a bit more time to analyze and discuss exactly what the \nimplications of this amendment are.\n  Mr. President, I rise to address the issue of comprehensive \nimmigration reform. I want to acknowledge the work of those on the \nJudiciary Committee who have done a fabulous job, in my view, through \nextensive hearings and a very worthwhile markup session. I watched \nalmost every minute of it. I was deeply impressed with our colleagues, \nRepublicans and Democrats, who addressed this issue.\n  Let me be clear from the outset--something we need to say over and \nover and over and over again--immigration reform is first and foremost \nabout protecting America's national security, our economy, and our \ncitizens from the myriad of challenges we are going to face in the 21st \ncentury. We have no higher priority than those: to protect our national \nsecurity, to protect our borders, and to protect our economy.\n  Therefore, any discussion of immigration reform must begin with an \nemphatic declaration of our intentions here: to secure our borders; to \nprotect our citizens from a flood of people arriving here, albeit with \ngood motives. But it is unrealistic to assume that any nation in this \nworld can have open borders--unlimited for people who want to come \nhere. So I believe it is extremely important we state that case at the \noutset.\n  But I also believe that it is an enormously complex and difficult \nissue. It is that very complexity that leads us to the concerns \nexpressed by some of my colleagues. There is a very real temptation to \ndeal only with certain aspects of immigration and to put off the more \ndifficult matters to some future time and date. That is exactly what \nthe other body did back in December when they passed a bill dealing \nonly with the issue of border security and enforcement and neglected \nentirely dealing with the phenomena of 11 million human beings who \nreside in this country today without documentation.\n  Which brings me to the legislation currently before the Senate. One \nversion, introduced by our colleague, Senator Frist, mainly addresses \nborder security and enforcement. Certainly, these are critical \ncomponents of any immigration reform package. No bill should be \nconsidered comprehensive without them at all. But Senator Frist's bill \ndoes not go nearly far enough toward addressing the other monumental \nchallenges we face on immigration, including the presence of more than \n11 million human beings, undocumented, in the United States, who need \nto be brought out of the shadows and into the open.\n  In my view, turning our backs on this reality is the same thing as \nturning our backs on providing border security. If we had a bill before \nus that only dealt with how we handle 11 million people who are here \nillegally and not border security, that would be a flawed piece of \nlegislation. The fact that you are dealing with just border security is \nequally flawed. We need to have both parts here if we are going to \nsucceed.\n  Thankfully, of course, Senator Specter has provided us, along with \nthe Judiciary Committee members, with an approach that does address \nboth pieces of this problem. Is it an imperfect bill? Absolutely. Does \nit need more work? Absolutely. But clearly, it is one that brings the \nbalance of dealing with border security, national security, and \neconomic security, as well as realistically trying to deal with the 11 \nmillion undocumented workers who have come to our country.\n  The Specter amendment toughens our borders. We clearly need to do \nmore to control these borders and to prevent individuals from illegally \nentering our country because, fundamentally, border control is a \nnational security issue. The Specter amendment would provide advanced \nborder security technologies to assist those tasked with protecting \nthese frontiers. The Specter amendment would also improve our ability \nto enforce immigration laws by making structural reforms and increasing \npersonnel and funding levels where they are needed most. I won't go \ninto all the details here, but 12,000 new agents along that border will \nclearly help.\n  My good friend from Texas, Senator Cornyn, and I were privileged to \nattend a meeting in Mexico a few weeks ago, an interparliamentary \nmeeting that I have attended for 26 years--odd years here, even years \nin Mexico. We were both deeply impressed with a document prepared by \nour colleagues in Mexico that has been signed by all five candidates \nfor President of Mexico, which will be holding elections on July 2, as \nwell as the major parties in Mexico. It is a rather short document. I \nwill ask for it to be included in the Record. Senator Cornyn and I \nactually sent this to each of our colleagues to look at. But our \nfriends from Mexico list national security, border security, as one of \nthe guiding principles in what must be a part of any immigration reform \nproposal. It is worth reading because these issues are not only our \nconcern but their concern as well. If Mexico is unwilling or incapable \nof helping us keep our borders secure, then this legislation will not \nwork.\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[The Mexican Congress adopted this document as a Concurrent Resolution]\n\n                  Mexico and the Migration Phenomenon\n\n       In Mexico, as in other countries and regions of the world, \n     migration is a complex and difficult phenomenon to approach. \n     The diverse migration processes of exit, entrance, return and \n     transit of migrants are all present in our country.\n       Given the extent and the characteristics of today's \n     migration phenomenon, which will continue in the immediate \n     future and given the implications that it represents for our \n     country's development, a new vision and a change are \n     necessary in the way Mexican society has approached, thus \n     far, its responsibilities toward the migration phenomenon.\n       Over the last years, the magnitude reached by Mexican \n     migration and its complex effects in the economic and social \n     life of Mexico and the United States, have made the migration \n     phenomenon increasingly important for the national agendas of \n     both countries, and a priority issue in the bilateral agenda.\n       From the outset of the Administration, the government of \n     President Fox put forward a proposal to the Mexican public \n     opinion and to the highest authorities in the United States, \n     regarding a comprehensive plan aimed at dealing with the \n     diverse aspects of migration between the two countries. \n     Mexico based its proposal on the principle of shared \n     responsibility, which acknowledges that both countries must \n     do their share in order to obtain the best results from the \n     bilateral management of the migration phenomenon.\n       In 2001, the governments of both nations intensified the \n     dialogue and set in motion a process of bilateral \n     negotiations with the intent of finding ways to face the \n     multiple challenges and opportunities of the phenomenon; \n     these actions were taken with the objective of establishing a \n     new migration framework between the two countries.\n       However, the terrorist attacks of September 2001 against \n     the United States, criminal acts which were unmistakably \n     deplorable, altered the bilateral agenda on migration. On the \n     one hand, the link between migration and national security--\n     mainly along the shared border--is now an essential issue of \n     that agenda. On the other hand, the participation in the \n     migration debate of varied political actors--especially \n     legislators of both countries--has increased.\n       The debate that is currently taking place in the United \n     States, concerning a possible migration reform, represents an \n     opportunity for Mexico and for the bilateral handling of the \n     phenomenon. It also encourages a deep analysis of the \n     consequences that this process can have for our country and \n     its migration policy.\n       Based on a joint initiative by the Executive Branch and the \n     Senate of Mexico, a group of federal authorities responsible \n     for the management of the migration phenomenon, senators and \n     congressmen, members of the academia, experts in migratory \n     issues, and representatives of civil society organizations, \n     agreed to initiate an effort that seeks to build a national \n     migration policy, founded over shared diagnoses and \n     platforms. Accordingly, the group has held a series of \n     discussions titled Prospects and Design of Platforms for the \n     Construction of a Mexican Migration Policy.\n       The ideas expressed in this document are the result of \n     those discussions. They intend to bring up to date Mexico's \n     migration position and to offer some specific guidance \n     regarding the process of migration reform in the United \n     States.\n\n[[Page S2788]]\n\n                               Principles\n\n       Based on the discussions held, the participants agreed upon \n     the following set of principles that should guide Mexico's \n     migration policy:\n       The migration phenomenon should be fully understood by the \n     Mexican State--society and government--because it demands \n     actions and commitments that respond to the prevailing \n     conditions.\n       The migration phenomenon has international implications \n     that demand from Mexico actions and international \n     commitments--in particular with the neighboring regions and \n     countries--which, in accordance with the spirit of \n     international cooperation, should be guided by the principle \n     of shared responsibility.\n       Mexico's migration policy acknowledges that as long as a \n     large number of Mexicans do not find in their own country an \n     economic and social environment that facilitates their full \n     development and well-being, and that encourages people to \n     stay in the country, conditions for emigrating abroad will \n     exist.\n       Mexico must develop and enforce its migration laws and \n     policy with full respect for the human rights of the migrants \n     and their relatives, notwithstanding their nationality and \n     migration status, as well as respecting the refugee and \n     asylum rights, in accordance with the applicable \n     international instruments.\n       The increased linkage between migration, borders and \n     security on the international level, is a reality present in \n     the relationship with our neighboring countries. Hence, it is \n     necessary to consider those three elements when drawing up \n     migration policies.\n       Mexico is committed to fighting all forms of human \n     smuggling and related criminal activities, to protecting the \n     integrity and safety of persons, and to deepening the \n     appropriate cooperation with the governments of the \n     neighboring countries.\n       The migration processes that prevail in Mexico are \n     regionally articulated--in particular with Central America--, \n     and therefore the Mexican migration policy should deepen its \n     regional approach.\n\n\n Recommendations regarding the commitments that Mexico should agree on\n\n       Main recommendations considered by the group in order to \n     update Mexico's migration policy:\n       Based on the new regional and international realities \n     regarding immigration, transmigration and emigration, it is \n     necessary to evaluate and to update the present migration \n     policy of the Mexican State, as well as its legal and \n     normative framework, with a timeline of fifteen to twenty \n     years.\n       It is necessary to impel the economical and social \n     development that, among other positive effects, will \n     encourage people to stay in Mexico.\n       If a guest country offers a sufficient number of \n     appropriate visas to cover the biggest possible number of \n     workers and their families, which until now cross the border \n     without documents because of the impossibility of obtaining \n     them, Mexico should be responsible for guaranteeing that each \n     person that decides to leave its territory does so following \n     legal channels.\n       Based on international cooperation, Mexico must strengthen \n     the combat against criminal organizations specialized in \n     migrant smuggling and in the use of false documents, as well \n     as the policies and the legal and normative framework for the \n     prevention and prosecution of human smuggling, especially \n     women and children, and the protection of the victims of that \n     crime.\n       It is necessary to promote the return and adequate \n     reincorporation of migrants and their families to national \n     territory.\n       Mexico's migration policy must be adjusted taking into \n     account the characteristics of our neighboring countries, in \n     order to safeguard the border and to facilitate the legal, \n     safe and orderly flow of people, under the principles of \n     shared responsibility and respect for human rights.\n       Order and security in Mexico's north and south borders must \n     be fortified, with an emphasis on the development of the \n     border regions.\n       Reinforce cooperation with the United States and Canada \n     through the Security and Prosperity Partnership for North \n     America, and with the regional bodies and mechanisms for \n     the treatment of the phenomenon, like the Regional \n     Conference on Migration and the Cumbre Iberoamericana.\n       The review and, if necessary, adjustment of the judicial \n     and institutional framework, in order to adequately respond \n     to the present and the foreseeable conditions of the \n     migration phenomenon; this will require the creation of a \n     specialized inter-institutional mechanism of collaboration.\n       The creation of permanent work mechanisms for the Executive \n     and Legislative Branches, with the participation of academic \n     and civil society representatives that allow the development \n     and fulfillment of Mexico's migration agenda.\n\n\n  Elements related to a possible migration reform in the United States\n\n       Mexico does not promote undocumented migration and is eager \n     to participate in finding solutions that will help us face \n     the migration phenomenon. Accordingly, the group decided to \n     express certain thoughts about what is Mexico's position in \n     case a migration reform takes place in the United States.\n       Acknowledging the sovereign right of each country to \n     regulate the entrance of foreigners and the conditions of \n     their stay. It is indispensable to find a so1ution for the \n     undocumented population that lives in the United States and \n     contributes to the development of the country, so that people \n     can be fully incorporated into their actual communities, with \n     the same rights and duties.\n       Support the proposal of a far-reaching guest workers \n     scheme, which should be one of the parts of a larger process \n     that includes the attention of the undocumented Mexicans that \n     live in the United States.\n       In order for a guest workers program to be viable, Mexico \n     should participate in its design, management, supervision and \n     evaluation, under the principle of shared responsibility.\n       A scheme aimed to process the legal temporary flow of \n     persons, will allow Mexico and the United States to better \n     combat criminal organizations specialized in the smuggling of \n     migrants and the use of false documents, and to combat, in \n     general, the violence and the insecurity that prevail in the \n     shared border. Likewise, Mexico would be in a better position \n     to exhort potential migrants to abide by the proper rules and \n     to adopt measures in order to reduce undocumented migration.\n       Mexico should conclude the studies that are being conducted \n     to know which tasks will help with the implementation of a \n     guest workers program, regarding the proper management of the \n     supply of potential participants, the establishment of \n     supporting certification mechanisms, and the supervision and \n     evaluation of its development.\n       Mexico acknowledges that a crucial aspect for the success \n     of a temporary workers program refers to the capacity to \n     guarantee the circular flow of the participants, as well as \n     the development of incentives that encourage migrants to \n     return to our country. Mexico could significantly enhance its \n     tax-preferred housing programs, so that migrants can \n     construct a house in their home communities while they work \n     in the United States.\n       Other mechanisms that should be developed are the \n     establishment of a bilateral medical insurance system to \n     cover migrants and their relatives, as well as the agreement \n     of totalization of pension benefits, which will allow \n     Mexicans working in the United States to collect their \n     pension benefits in Mexico.\n       Mexico could also enhance the programs of its Labor and \n     Social Development Ministries, in order to establish social \n     and working conditions that encourage and ease the return and \n     reincorporation of Mexicans into their home communities.\n       This working group aims to become a permanent body of \n     study, debate and development of public policies for the \n     handling of the migration phenomenon.\n  Mr. DODD. The other provision I wish to address in the brief time I \nhave available goes beyond the border security issue that the Specter \namendment clearly addresses. Individuals have come to our country \nlooking for work, and we know from surveys that 94 percent of \nundocumented males in this country are in fact working. These are not \nunemployed people who are looking for first-time jobs; these are people \nwith jobs who saw a better opportunity in coming across our borders.\n  I know it has been said, but every one of us here can tell family \nstories going back a generation or more, regardless of where we have \ncome from, on why our forebears came here. Mostly it was for economic \nreasons, in the past, or political reasons that made it difficult for \nour forebears to remain in the countries of their birth.\n  I acknowledge that people have come here illegally. That is wrong, \nand we need to put a stop to it. The Specter amendment also \nacknowledges that fact. It doesn't give these people a free ride at \nall. Instead, it would penalize illegal immigrants by requiring \nundocumented workers to pay fines, pay all back taxes, submit \nthemselves to background checks, and learn English. But then it does \nallow them to move out of that status. That is one of the differences.\n  If we add an additional burden, which our friends from Arizona and \nTexas are implying here, that if you came in under a legal visa and you \nhave overstayed that visa, then you can never move out of that status \nagain regardless of whether you have complied with these other \nprovisions, it seems to me we are only compounding our problems.\n  Certainly, this legislation also provides an avenue for undocumented \nworkers to come out in the open, to earn legalization. Earning legal \nstatus wouldn't be an easy process. An individual who takes advantage \nof this program would have to work for 6 years before he or she could \neven receive a green card. At that point, they would be put at the back \nof the line of some 3.5 million people who are legally seeking entry \ninto the United States as I speak. They would come first. These \nundocumented workers would come after those people had been approved.\n\n[[Page S2789]]\n\nIt would take a minimum of 5 additional years of steady employment \nbefore the individual could finally become an American citizen. That is \n11 years. That is certainly not a light process to go through. With a \npathway to citizenship--not amnesty at all but an earned pathway--we \nwill provide incentives to undocumented workers to come out of the \nshadows of society.\n  Why is that important? For many reasons. Because the presence of so \nmany individuals without documentation in our country creates enormous \nchallenges for law enforcement. It undermines worker protections. It is \nbad for security. It is bad for American workers. It is bad for \nundocumented immigrants themselves. Moreover, it is impossible to \nadequately protect U.S. national security if we don't know who is \nliving within our borders. And by bringing undocumented workers into \nthe open, we will help law enforcement professionals and our security \nservices do their jobs: protecting the American people and enforcing \nour laws--there is no higher priority we have than that. And if we have \na process that goes on for 11 years, a pathway, we begin to assist in \nthat effort.\n  As I said, among other provisions, the Specter amendment would double \nthe size of the Border Patrol over 5 years, adding 12,000 new agents to \npatrol our borders. It would expand the number of interior enforcement \nofficers by 1,000 per year over each of the next 5 years. It would \nutilize advanced technologies to improve surveillance along the border, \ncreating a virtual fence to detect and apprehend people who are \nillegally attempting to enter this country. And it would create new and \nincreased penalties for individuals trying to subvert our borders with \ntunnels or who attempt to smuggle people into the U.S.\n  I support these measures. But they are only one part of the bigger \nequation. We also have to find a way to deal with the more than 11 \nmillion undocumented individuals living within our borders.\n  These are predominantly individuals who have come to the U.S. to make \na living, and to support themselves and their families. Ninety-four \npercent of undocumented men, according to a March 7, 2006, Pew poll, \nchoose to work. These are, for the most part, hardworking individuals, \nwho are not here to flood the welfare rolls or collect our charity. \nThey are here to work and to contribute. They want what all of our \nfamilies wanted when they came to the U.S.--a piece of the American \ndream.\n  I acknowledge that they came here illegally and this is wrong. And so \ndoes the Specter amendment. It wouldn't give them a free ride. Instead, \nit would penalize illegal immigrants by requiring undocumented workers \nto pay fines. It would require them to pay all back taxes, submit \nthemselves to background checks, and learn English.\n  But critically, this legislation also provides an avenue for \nundocumented workers to come out into the open, to earn legalization. \nEarning legal status wouldn't be an easy process either. An individual \nwho takes advantage of this program would have to work for 6 years \nbefore he or she could even receive a green card. At that point, they \nwould be put at the back of the line--behind everyone who has come here \nlegally--and it would take a minimum of 5 additional years of steady \nemployment before the individual could finally become an American \ncitizen. That's 11 years in total.\n  With a pathway to citizenship, not an amnesty but an earned pathway, \nwe will provide incentives to undocumented workers to come out of the \nshadows of our society. Why is this so important?\n  Because the presence of so many individuals without documentation in \nour country creates enormous challenges for law enforcement and \nundermines worker protections. It is bad for our security, bad for the \nAmerican worker, and bad for undocumented immigrants themselves.\n  Moreover, it is impossible to adequately protect U.S. national \nsecurity if we don't know who is living within our borders. By bringing \nundocumented individuals out into the open, we will help law \nenforcement professionals and our security services do their job: \nprotecting the American people and enforcing our laws. We will also \nhelp prevent the type of workplace abuses that are bad for everyone, \nAmericans and immigrants alike.\n  Despite what has been said on this floor, not all people seek to come \npermanently to the U.S. Many seek temporary work here and desire to \nreturn home when that work is complete.\n  There are legitimate concerns that temporary workers might displace \nAmerican workers who are available and willing to take a job. That \nshould never be the case. Wherever possible, American jobs should be \nfilled first and foremost with American workers.\n  The Specter amendment addresses this reality. It creates a new \ntemporary worker classification to meet the needs of American \nbusinesses. It would also strengthen procedures to help ensure that no \nAmerican workers are displaced when temporary workers are hired.\n  As I have said, the Specter amendment is truly comprehensive \nlegislation. It would be impossible to discuss every provision in the \nbill at length. So I would just like to comment briefly on a few \nadditional items of interest.\n  First, I am pleased that the Judiciary Committee included provisions \nof the DREAM Act in its legislation. I've long supported the DREAM Act, \nwhich in my view is a common sense measure, allowing undocumented \nstudents under the age of 16, who were brought into this country \nillegally through no fault of their own, a chance to complete higher \neducation.\n  Qualifying students, however, will have had to live in the U.S. for \nat least 5 years prior to the date of enactment of this legislation. If \nthey earn and advanced degree or serve our country in the Armed Forces, \nthey would then be granted permanent status and allowed to petition for \ncitizenship. Every student deserves a chance to learn and to serve a \ncause greater than themselves. This measure will give many deserving \nchildren that opportunity.\n  Finally, I would like to highlight a provision included in the \nSpecter amendment that is receiving somewhat less attention. Throughout \nmy tenure in the Senate, I've tried to raise awareness about western \nhemisphere affairs. Indeed during all my years in this body, I have \nserved as a member of the Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Western \nHemisphere, Peace Corps, and Narcotics Affairs--even, for a time, as \nchairman. One thing I would note about the immigration issue, from a \nregional perspective, is that many of the problems we are facing--drug \ntrafficking, crime, and insecurity--are also affecting our neighbors in \nthe hemisphere. Just like us, they are struggling to address these \nseemingly intractable problems every day.\n  That is why I am pleased that in its bill, the Judiciary Committee \nincluded measures to help our neighbors. In particular, the Specter \namendment would establish programs to help Guatemala and Belize fight \nhuman smuggling and gain control of their tenuous borders. It would \nalso encourage strategic coordination across the hemisphere to fight \nthe growing problem of gang violence. In my view, these are critically \nimportant provisions, and I hope we can do more to help some of our \nclosest neighbors on these issues. Because in reality, we cannot solve \nour problems here without also addressing the roots of the problems \nabroad.\n  Unless we act now to address the enormous challenge posed by illegal \nimmigration, the problem is only going to get worse. The Specter \namendment isn't perfect--I think most of my colleagues would agree with \nthat statement--but I do believe it is a critical measure that will \nhelp to resolve many of the challenges we face with respect to illegal \nimmigration. I again thank my colleagues for their hard work and \nleadership on this issue.\n  My hope is that we strike that balance between border security, \neconomic security, national security, and then also designing, as we \nhave with the Specter amendment, a process that will allow for these \npeople to move out of the shadows into the open, and into a legal \nstatus. It is a difficult path, a cumbersome path, but a path that will \nallow them to achieve that status at the end of the road.\n  I urge adoption of the Specter amendment, and I urge that we not \ntable the Kyl amendment at this point, that we need to examine this \nissue even more carefully.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n\n[[Page S2790]]\n\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. May I inquire how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I ask to be notified when there is 2 minutes remaining \nand that that time be given to the Senator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will so notify.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Connecticut cares \npassionately about conditions. So do I, and so do all the Members of \nthe Senate about trying to find a solution. We have dramatic \ndifferences between the solutions which have been proposed here and \nthose which have been proposed by the House. But the way I interpret \nwhat the House did, it is to send a message to the Senate that first \nand foremost we need to build a foundation of border security to stop \nthe people streaming across our border--yes, in search of a better \nlife, but we know that mingled amongst those people who come here for \neconomic reasons because they have, perhaps, no hope and no opportunity \nwhere they live, there may be a criminal. There may be a terrorist. \nWhile there are many people who do care passionately about trying to \nfind a comprehensive solution to this problem, the kind of slow-boating \nwe have seen so far during this debate isn't helping us get to that \nsolution.\n  In fact, we have had three votes on amendments since this bill came \nto the floor. To those who say: Yes, we want to find a solution; yes, \nthe bill that is on the floor is a good start, but maybe it is not \nperfect; the best way for us to proceed is to have some votes and to \nhave some debate--that is the way this body, sometimes noted as the \ngreatest deliberative body on Earth, is supposed to work. That is the \nway democracy works. I may win some of those votes. I may lose some. \nBut let's have debate. Let's build a consensus in the country by \nbuilding a consensus in this body about where we ought to go to find a \nsolution, and then let majorities govern. Let's reconcile our \ndifferences with the House and then send a bill to the President that \nhe will sign that is consistent with our values, consistent with our \nsecurity interests, and consistent with our economic interests. That is \nwhat I want to do.\n  I believe many on the floor of the Senate want to do that. But what \nwe have seen by the fact that the Democratic leadership has objected to \nallowing us to set aside pending amendments or have votes on pending \namendments up until this point is that we have had three votes, and we \nare running out of time. The leader has allocated 2 weeks to debate \nthis bill and hopefully to finish it by Thursday night or Friday, when \nwe begin the next 2-week recess. But I am getting the distinct \nimpression that the desire is not so much to pass a bill but, rather, \nto block the kind of democratic process I just described a moment ago \nfrom even occurring, to prevent Senators from offering their \nsuggestions by way of amendment and offering those to the Members for \nan up-or-down vote on the Senate floor. It bears some resemblance to \nsome of the obstruction we have seen in the past, particularly when it \ncomes to judicial nominations. It prevents the Senate from working its \nwill. It prevents us from protecting the American people.\n  When I say ``protecting the American people,'' I am advised that \ntoday, according to current numbers on illegal immigration across our \nborders, we have about 2,300 people coming each day into our country \nacross our broken borders. Last year, it was 1.1 million people, but \ntoday and each day that we fail to protect our borders, each day we \nfail to deal with this very complex but urgent and important problem, \nwe have 2,300 more people coming across our broken borders. I hope and \npray that it is not someone who is bent on doing some harm to innocent \nlife.\n  We know in a post-9/11 world that those who would exploit our broken \nborders could, if they had the desire, perhaps commit another heinous \nact like 9/11 within our country. We know that recently, there were \nthose from this body who were investigating the possibility: Can you \nsmuggle the ingredients of a dirty bomb across our borders? Indeed, \nthey were able to do so by producing false identification. So we know \nAmerica is vulnerable. But how irresponsible would it be to block the \nability of this body to consider this bill, to pass it in due course, \nand to get it on the President's desk?\n  I fear there are those who want to jam this bill, as it is currently \nwritten, down the throats of those of us who have a different idea or \nprevent us from having those votes which are important to letting the \nprocess work. None of us has the authority to dictate to others what \nkind of legislation is going to pass out of this body. I am afraid that \nis what we are seeing. Those who preferred this particular approach in \nthe Judiciary Committee bill are trying to jam it through the Senate, \ntrying to deny those of us who have different ideas from presenting \nthose ideas and offering them for a vote on the Senate floor.\n  This particular motion to table the amendment Senator Kyl and I have \nproposed is illustrative of the important changes and improvements that \nneed to be made to this bill. Indeed, if you compare this to 1986, the \nlast time Congress passed an amnesty that failed completely, you will \nsee a lot of similarities between the bill on the floor and that \namnesty in 1986--except, believe it or not, the bill that is presently \nbefore the Senate is even worse. In 1986, the law said that if you are \na convicted felon, if you have committed three misdemeanors, you are \nnot eligible for amnesty. This bill on the floor does not provide that \nexclusion from the general grant of amnesty.\n  Furthermore, there are some who say: OK, convicted felons, people who \ncommit misdemeanors, but don't exclude from the grant of amnesty the 4- \nto 500,000 people who have had their day in court, who are so-called \nabsconders, who are under final orders of deportation, because it \nwouldn't be fair to exclude them from this general grant of amnesty.\n  I disagree. I believe if you have had one bite at the apple or if you \nhave had your day in court, you have had due process of law but you \nhave demonstrated your unwillingness to comply with the lawful order of \na court, then you should not be given amnesty so that you can remain in \nthis country because if you are demonstrating by your very first acts, \nonce you have come to this country, that you have no respect for our \nlaws, then how are we to expect that you will ever have respect for \nother laws that are important for public safety and for the welfare of \nthe American people?\n  Among these 4- to 500,000 people who would be included as absconders \nthat this motion to table seeks to prevent us from excluding under the \ngeneral grant of amnesty, in 2004, the Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement detention and removal operations removed 165,000-plus \naliens from the United States. Of those 165,000-plus, 65,000 had been \npreviously formally removed or deported at least one time before. So \nnot only are the people who are sought to be excluded from this general \ngrant of amnesty guilty of violating our laws, many of them are guilty \nof violating it on a serial basis.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes remains on the Senator's side.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I urge our colleagues not to table this important \namendment, that we have an up-or-down vote on the Senate floor as soon \nas possible.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, is there any time remaining on the other \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I will take a couple of minutes to close. I \ngather this will be a 100-to-nothing vote not to table. I agree with \nthe Senator from Texas. We should not table the amendment, but we \nshould have a vote up or down on it. If you don't like it, then vote \nagainst it.\n  I will make something very clear. If you came across the border from \nMexico into the United States, into Texas, Arizona, California or New \nMexico, and you came across illegally, this amendment has nothing \nwhatsoever to do with you--unless you also are a criminal or you have \nbeen convicted of a felony or of three misdemeanors or you are an \nabsconder--that is to say, after you came into the country illegally, \nand you were ordered to leave by a judge, and you refused to leave. \nThose are the circumstances this amendment applies to. It doesn't apply \nto you if all you did was come in illegally. In other words, that \nstatus is not implicated by this amendment.\n  We simply seek to deny the benefits of this legislation--legal \npermanent\n\n[[Page S2791]]\n\nresidency and a pathway to citizenship--to people convicted of a \nfelony, three misdemeanors or, in this category of an absconder, which \nthe Senator from Texas talked about. Why is this important? It is \nbecause there are a certain number of people who have violated such an \norder. They have failed to leave the country when they were ordered to \ndo so.\n  According to the testimony before the subcommittee I chair in the \nJudiciary Committee, about a month ago, the statistics are now that \nabout 10 percent of the people entering the country illegally are \ncriminals; it is between 10 and 15 percent. They are serious criminals. \nI hope that my colleagues vote ``no'' on the motion to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I will turn to the chairman in a moment, \nbut we are in an unusual situation. When we step back and look at this \nbill, we see we have an important bill that is a national security \nissue, an issue of fairness and equity, and we have a good bill on the \nfloor that does not have 60 votes. That is pretty clear today, after \nall of the discussions. Yet we are not allowed--in spite of having good \namendments which can make this bill even better, we are not being \nallowed to move those amendments forward at all.\n  It is very clear by the last vote where the vote was, I think almost \nunanimous, that people are not serious about moving these amendments \nforward one at a time. I think it is disrespectful to the body itself \nbecause they are good amendments on both sides of the aisle that need \nto be debated and that need to come to a vote, and we are not allowed \nto do that. It is coming from the other side of the aisle.\n  I think that we need to get serious about it. It needs to be a \ndignified debate and a civil debate. Right now, we are not going to \nfinish the bill. It is in effect being blocked by the other side \nbecause we are not allowed to get amendments to the floor so that at \nsome point this bill could reach a threshold of 60 votes.\n  So I am very frustrated now, and I think colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle are. I know the chairman is. We had about 2 hours of debate \nearlier this afternoon that made it very apparent that the other side \nis trying to stop the bill. I just plead with our colleagues to come \ntogether and have both sides be able to offer their amendments.\n  It is Tuesday. If we work tonight and we work Wednesday and Thursday \nand Friday, we can pass a bill that will address border security, that \nwill address interior enforcement and worksite enforcement, and that \nwill address the issue of a temporary worker program that is fair to \nthe 12 million or 13 million or 11 million people out there today who \nare here illegally.\n  That is what can be achieved. But the other side is basically \ndelaying, postponing, obstructing, and not allowing us to consider \namendments, and that is all that we ask.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I think it takes a lot to criticize the fact \nthat Republicans are offering amendments and we wouldn't allow votes on \nthem. This has been the history of the Republican-controlled Senate for \nyears: not allowing us to have votes on amendments that we offer, or \nwanted to offer. How many amendments have there been? Minimum wage, \nDubai Ports, health care in many different areas such as stem cell, \nprescription drugs, and importation of prescription drugs. So there may \nbe some logical issues that could be propounded as to why the majority \ndoesn't like what is going on here. But the fact that we are not \nallowing votes on amendments should fall on deaf ears because we are \nexperts at trying to offer amendments and not having votes on them.\n  So I repeat what I said a little while ago. We have on the Senate \nfloor today a bipartisan piece of legislation. Over here, we are \nunited. We like the bill. The vast majority of us in the minority \nreally like this bill, the one that is before the Senate right now. For \nexample, the Kyl amendment, which was not tabled--it was moved in an \neffort to table their own amendment, which was somewhat surprising to \nme, but it wasn't tabled. The Kyl amendment, as I have explained on the \nfloor before, would defeat a very good bipartisan bill. It would take \nwhat I believe, from my eyes, is the integrity of the bill, it would \ntake it away.\n  This is a good bill, a bill that has strong enforcement. It provides \nfor guest workers, and those in America who are interested in business \nsupport this. For example, the Chamber of Commerce, including the \nNational Chamber of Commerce, supports those provisions in this bill, \nand then, of course, the path to legalization, which is so American, \nnot anti-American--the path to legalization for these people.\n  I don't believe we should do amnesty. I was part of that in 1986 and \nit didn't work very well, and that is an understatement. This is not \namnesty, what is in this bill. I like it. The vast majority of the \nminority likes it.\n  So we are willing to have our efforts rise or fall on this bill that \nis before the Senate. We are not going to allow amendments like Kyl-\nCornyn take out what we believe is the goodness of this bill.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I interpret what the Democratic leader said \nto be that we have a bill on the floor that is a good bill and a solid \nbill but that the other side of the aisle does not want to give us the \nopportunity to amend that bill in any way, that they just want to flat \nout deny that. And I say--and that is my question--that the other side \nreally just wants one vote, and it is on a bill that is a good bill, \nbut we haven't given everybody here the opportunity to participate and \ndebate and amend. That is my interpretation. I think that is wrong. I \nsay that because we just voted 99 to 0 not to table the Kyl amendment.\n  So the Kyl amendment is pending, and it is the regular order of \nbusiness that has been pending Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, \nMonday, Tuesday--6 days, 7 days it is pending, and they will not give \nus a vote, an up-or-down vote on the Kyl amendment. It is as simple as \nthat.\n  The signal is that we are not going to consider any amendments. In \nfact, the statement is that we are not going to consider any \namendments. Let us go straight and see if this underlying bill has a \n60-vote cloture; is that correct?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will be happy to respond to that. I will \nrespond to the distinguished majority leader. We have had three votes \non Frist-Reid, Bingaman, and the other was--anyway, we have had three \namendments, and they are amendments that we would be\n\n[[Page S2792]]\n\nhappy to sit down and discuss, as I indicated earlier, and--the other \nis the Alexander amendment, thank you--sit down and find a way we can \nproceed.\n  We have Mikulski-Warner, Dorgan-Snowe-Burns, the Bond amendment, I \nthink it is Collins, Brownback-Lieberman have an amendment, Stevens-\nLeahy have an amendment. So there are some amendments we could work on.\n\n  But let me just say this: We are happy to try to work something out. \nIt is my belief--and people could disagree. It is certainly everyone's \nright to disagree. I don't think some of these amendments, some of \nthese amendments I have talked about, would take away what I call the \nintegrity of the bill. But I do say to my friend--and he is my friend, \nthe distinguished majority leader--we have had example after example in \nthe last many years where there is legislation on this floor and we are \nnot allowed to offer amendments. We offer them once in a while, we \ndon't get votes on those, and we are not allowed to offer amendments.\n  As my mother would say, they are getting a taste of their own \nmedicine.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, again, I would ask--the Kyl amendment was \nnot tabled, so it is the pending amendment. And I would ask if the \nother side would be willing to give us a rollcall vote on that \namendment. It is not tabled at this juncture.\n  Mr. REID. The answer is no.\n  Mr. FRIST. The answer is no. That is the first one.\n  Let us go to the Mikulski amendment, the next one that has been \npending for X number of days, and I would ask that we consider the \nMikulski amendment and take it to a vote and vote on it right now.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as I said just a few minutes ago, I would be \nhappy to have the two managers, with the appropriate staff--I have \nlisted a number of amendments here: Mikulski-Warner-Snowe, Dorgan-\nBurns, Bond, Collins, Brownback, Stevens-Leahy, maybe the Allard \namendment, which I haven't read in its entirety, but I think that is \nappropriate. I think what we should do--there are a number of these, \nand you may have some others on the other side that we could work out \nand set up a sequence of when we should vote on these, how much time \nshould be used in debate. I would be happy to do that.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I think it is clear. We are seeing in \nessence a stonewalling of the bill on the other side, an important bill \nthat is of national security. There are four amendments--the Kyl-Cornyn \namendment is the official amendment. We are being denied an up-or-down \nvote. The next one is Isakson; we are ready to vote on that. The next \none is Dorgan; we are ready to vote on that. The next one is Mikulski; \nwe are ready to vote on that. We are ready to vote on all four of \nthose.\n  What it sounds like to me is that the Democratic leader wants to pick \nour amendments and then we will consider and we will think about it, \nknowing--knowing--that we have Tuesday night, Wednesday, Thursday, and \nFriday to complete this bill. We are making no progress whatsoever \nbecause they are not allowing us to vote on amendments in the order \nthat they are there. So it is apparent to me--and I agree, we will let \nthe managers work on it, but it is apparent to me that the Democrats \nare not serious about passing a bill that affects the security of this \nNation.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Democrats are very serious about passing \na bill that affects the security of this Nation--this legislation and \nother legislation but particularly this legislation. We believe that \nthe first provision of this legislation, which we talked about from the \nvery beginning, is border security, security for our Nation. This \nlegislation that is now before the Senate will do that. But in addition \nto that, we want enforcement plus.\n  So as I have indicated, we want to pass the legislation right now. We \nwould be happy to vote on this bill right now.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill before the \nSenate be moved to third reading right now and vote on it.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I object.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, it would be a travesty of the procedures \nof the Senate to vote on this bill without giving Senators an \nopportunity to file amendments. It would just be--it is hard to find \nthe right characterization--a travesty, unheard of, unthinkable, \nunprecedented, idiotic--strike idiotic; the Supreme Court has that word \nfor its own--but our procedure is to vote on amendments.\n  Mr. President, I ask the distinguished Democratic leader if he would \nagree to start voting tomorrow morning at 9:30 on the list of \namendments he identified. Senator Leahy and I are prepared to work \nthrough the night and start voting tomorrow morning at 9:30 on those \namendments.\n  Mr. REID. Those that I mentioned?\n  Mr. SPECTER. The ones you mentioned.\n  Mr. REID. I would be happy to work with our manager, and with Senator \nKennedy, and come up with the sequence of how we should vote on these \nand how much time should be spent on each amendment. I would be happy \nto vote on that.\n  Mr. SPECTER. May we start the voting tomorrow morning at 9:30?\n  Mr. REID. I don't know; 9:30, or sometime tomorrow morning, if we \nwork out a sequence on these. That would be fine with me.\n  Mr. SPECTER. So we will start voting tomorrow morning sometime on the \nsequence of amendments that you have identified. And may we carry that \nfurther on other amendments which are pending? You haven't identified \nany other amendments----\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, the courtesy \nto colleagues here should be at least to include the ones that are \npending that I have read: Kyl-Cornyn, Dorgan, and Mikulski, that have \nbeen pending for days and days, rather than allowing the Democratic \nleader to cherry-pick amendments to vote on.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the use of words of the distinguished \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee--``travesty, unprecedented, \nunthinkable''--whatever those were, those are words I am going to \nremember. I should have come up with those before on all the many times \nthat we were unable to offer amendments on legislation that was pending \nbefore the Senate. But I think, as usual, the distinguished chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee did an outstanding job of describing what \nhappens when people are not allowed to offer amendments. We are experts \nat recognizing when we are not able to offer amendments.\n  As I say, again, we have a number of amendments we would be happy to \nvote on. My friend, the majority leader, said he wanted to add in those \nthat are pending, and we could not agree to that.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Could I ask the distinguished Democratic leader if we \ncan establish a procedure where the distinguished ranking member and \nI--we are the managers of the bill--go through the list of amendments \nand decide a sequencing of votes on these amendments--there must be \nmore than those identified by the Senator from Nevada--and try to get \nthe bill rolling with the votes, as you say, starting sometime tomorrow \nmorning?\n  Mr. REID. I have the greatest confidence in our ranking member, Pat \nLeahy. I have spoken in his behalf on this floor so many times I can't \ncount it, but we have, in addition to Senator Leahy, 44 other members \nof our caucus. I am not going to give you and Senator Leahy carte \nblanche as to what amendments would be offered and in what order.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator Specter, would you yield for 1 minute?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader has the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield to my friend, the distinguished Senator \nfrom New Mexico, for a statement of 1 minute or 2 minutes, whatever he \ncares to speak.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I didn't want to ask you because what I was going to \nsay you wouldn't like.\n  Mr. REID. I may not like what you say, but I like you.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Thank you very much. I tell you, I really cannot \nbelieve what I heard here today. I have been here 34 years, and I \ncannot believe what I have heard today. I have heard\n\n[[Page S2793]]\n\na minority leader say we are peeved because we have not had what we \nthink is a fair shake over the last couple of years since you have been \nrunning this place, so we are going to manage this bill from the \nminority leader chair, and there are going to be no amendments \nconsidered unless the minority, the ranking minority Member of the \nSenate puts his imprimatur on them.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Imprimatur.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. No matter how important the bill is--imprimatur, no \nmatter what it is. I said it the Italian way. You said it the French \nway. You all know what it meant: stamp of approval. Stamp of approval.\n  I have never heard of such a thing, never saw Senators standing \naround--they were in awe. What is he talking about?\n  The bill that is before us, he likes. He has had a caucus, and those \nSenators on the other side said this is a neat bill, this is what we \nwant to pass, and we sure don't want any amendments offered and voted \non that stir up that thing we like so much to any extent because we \ndon't want to get our Senators in any trouble. We don't want them \nvoting on any of these kinds of things that muddle up this bill. So our \nleader is going to stand up here and say we have just changed the \nSenate, and we are going to do it this way. There will be no amendments \nunless Harry Reid, elected as the minority leader of the Senate, says, \n``OK.''\n  Fellow Senators, I don't believe it. As a matter of fact, I thought \nwhen the distinguished leader of the other side, who is my dear \nfriend--dear friend, he knows that--when he got up and answered our \nleader and started with this business about minimum wage and these \nother things--I thought he had a nothing case. I thought, my God, he's \ndreaming them up. He has nothing to say.\n  What does that have to do with this bill, the minimum wage, the way \nwe didn't let amendments come up on that? It has nothing to do with \nthis bill, one of the most important bills confronting America. It has \nbeen said that it is at the turning point of relationships between \nMexico and America. And we have one Senator who has looked at the bill \nand said: It is good for our side of the aisle. We like it just like it \nis, and we don't care what the rules of the Senate are, there will be \nno amendments. We are in charge.\n  I am sorry, Mr. Leader. You were right. You said it too mildly. I \ngoofed up some words, but I said it right, and Senator Reid is not \nright on this one. He is right many times. This is not right. He is not \nright. He should not do this. The Senate should not let him do it.\n  If there is some way to not let him do it, he should not be permitted \nto do it. He knows we can't do that. He knows we cannot do that. He is \ntoo smart about the rules of the Senate. He knows we cannot say he \ncannot do it. But the Senate should say he cannot do it. I am telling \nyou Senators, Democrats and Republicans, you should say he cannot do \nthat.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have said nonchalantly, to put it in \nperspective, how much I appreciate the work of the members of the \nJudiciary Committee on this bill.\n  I am not going to spend a lot of time on this other than to say I \nthink it is so important that we understand the time people have spent \non this issue. The Senator from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, has \nbeen working on this issue of immigration for 35 years. He has seen \nwhat has happened in years past with all the different pieces of \nlegislation. I can remember legislative battles on the Senate floor \nthat we had with disputes between him and Alan Simpson, the \ndistinguished former Senator from Wyoming, who everyone knows was such \na good Senator, with such a great sense of humor.\n  Senator Leahy has, I think, done such an admirable job of being \nranking member on this committee.\n  We have gotten work done on this committee that no one ever expected \ncould be done. And the principal reason that work was able to be \naccomplished is because of the relationship that was developed between \nthe chairman and ranking member, Senator Specter and Senator Leahy.\n  If someone had come to me a month ago and said we would be in the \nstatus we are on this immigration bill, I would have said: No, I don't \nthink that could be accomplished. I do not think we can get a bill out \nof that committee.\n  But as I have said publicly, and certainly I have said it to the \ndistinguished majority leader, I thought his bill alone, dealing with \nenforcement only, was inappropriate and not good. I was surprised--but \npleasantly surprised--with the work product that came out of the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  Even when the distinguished majority leader said that he and the \nranking member would work during the week that we had off to see if \nthey could come up with a proposal, I kept checking with Senator Leahy \nand other members of the Judiciary Committee. And they felt there was a \nlot of movement.\n  When that committee met on Monday, there were compromises made, and a \nbipartisan bill came before the Senate; again, pleasantly surprising me \nand, to me, proving that when people work together to accomplish a goal \nand there is a partnership between those leading the committee, members \nof the committee usually go along with that leadership as they did in \nthis instance.\n  I appreciate the good work, and I support this legislation.\n\n\n                             CLOTURE MOTION\n\n  Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the standing rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the Specter \n     substitute amendment No. 3192.\n         Patrick J. Leahy, Edward M. Kennedy, Robert Menendez, \n           Frank R. Lautenberg, Joseph I. Lieberman, Carl Levin, \n           Maria Cantwell, Barack Obama, Tom Harkin, Hillary \n           Rodham Clinton, John F. Kerry, Dianne Feinstein, \n           Richard Durbin, Charles E. Schumer, Harry Reid, and \n           Daniel K. Akaka.\n\n  Mr. REID. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senate has taken significant and \nconstructive steps over the past week toward fixing our Nation's broken \nimmigration system. On March 27, the Senate Judiciary Committee \nreported a comprehensive and bipartisan package that is tough but \nsmart.\n  We sent to the Senate a bill that includes critical law enforcement \nand border security measures--tougher than the bill introduced by the \nmajority leader earlier last month. Our bill, which was passed by a \nstrong bipartisan 12-to-6 vote in committee, also includes realistic \nsolutions for the problem of the millions of undocumented presently \nliving inside our borders. We do not offer these aliens amnesty but \ncreate an incentive for them to come out of the shadows, register, and \nearn the opportunity to obtain legal status over the course of 11 \nyears.\n  Over the past week, we have taken strides to see these proposals \npassed into law. I thank the many Senators who have come to the floor \nto speak in support of the committee bill. Senators McCain and Kennedy, \nwho did the hard work of drafting many of these measures, have made \nstrong statements explaining why the committee bill is not an offer of \namnesty but represents an earned path to legalization and eventual \ncitizenship. Senator Feinstein spoke about how this bill is tough on \nenforcement but pragmatic in its temporary worker and legalization \nprograms.\n  I thank Senator Durbin for his eloquent statement last week \ndescribing the DREAM Act, which is included in the committee bill. \nSenator Lincoln, Senator Salazar, and Senator Obama have all come to \nspeak in favor of the ``enforcement-plus'' measures in the bipartisan \nbill.\n  We have voted to approve several amendments that further strengthen\n\n[[Page S2794]]\n\nthe bill. Senator Bingaman's amendment to bolster national security by \nassisting local law enforcement in border States was approved \noverwhelmingly yesterday. So was Senator Alexander's amendment to \nstrengthen citizenship programs, and last week, we passed a Frist-Reid \namendment to study the tragic deaths occurring at the border between \nthe United States and Mexico.\n  I hope we will vote next on the important amendment offered by \nSenator Mikulski with a long list of cosponsors from both sides of the \naisle. The Mikulski amendment will bring relief to employers by easing \nthe shortfall of seasonal workers.\n  I hope we will also vote on amendments that will be offered by \nSenator Bill Nelson to add additional enforcement provisions to the \nCommittee bill.\n  We have before us an opportunity to take a historic vote on a \nrealistic and reasonable system for immigration. Our bill protects \nAmerica's borders, strengthens enforcement, and remains true to \nAmerican values. We should pass this bill this week.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, today, I speak on the Specter-Leahy \nsubstitute to S. 2454, the Frist border security bill.\n  At the present time, the Frist bill contains no amnesty for illegal \naliens. However, if the Specter-Leahy substitute is adopted, it would \neffectively attach a massive amnesty for 8 to 12 million illegal aliens \nand provide those illegal aliens with a path to U.S. citizenship. \nAccording to immigration experts, the pending substitute amendment--\nwith its guest-worker program and amnesty for undocumented aliens--\nwould open the gates to 30 million legal and illegal immigrants over \nthe next decade.\n  I oppose this amnesty proposal--absolutely and unequivocally. I urge \nthe Senate to pass a clean border security bill like the House did--\nwithout amnesty, without a guest-worker program, and without an \nincrease in the annual allotment of permanent immigrant visas.\n  For more than 4 years, the Nation has wondered how 19 terrorists \nmanaged to penetrate our border defenses to carry out the September 11 \nattacks. It chills the blood to think of those terrorists crossing our \nborders not once, but several times, in the months before the attack--\neasily outsmarting our border security checks to plot their dastardly \nscheme. They walked among us as tourists, students, and business \ntravelers. Three of them even stayed in the United States as illegal \naliens.\n  Today, more than 4 years later, our country remains dangerously \nexposed to terrorists seeking to penetrate our border defenses. Since \nSeptember 2001, an estimated 2 million new illegal immigrants have \nsuccessfully beaten our border and interior security, and are now \nsettled in the United States. That's 2 million new illegal immigrants \nsince the Government pledged to regain control of the border after the \n9/11 attacks.\n  Our immigration agencies are plagued with management and morale \nproblems. They still do not have an exit-entry system with \ninteroperable, biometric watch lists to accurately identify who is \nentering the country. We still cannot tell who is leaving the country. \nThe requirement for foreign visitors to use biometric, machine-readable \npassports continues to be delayed, exempting millions of aliens each \nyear from background checks. The administration, still, stubbornly \nrefuses to support the resources our border and interior enforcement \nagencies need to effectively do their jobs.\n  Meanwhile, the immigrant population continues to surge. The Center \nfor Immigration Studies calculates that 1.5 million immigrants are \nsettling both legally and illegally in the United States each year. The \nU.S. Census Bureau projects that immigration will be a major cause of \nthe population of the United States increasing to 400 million people in \nless than 50 years.\n  The National Research Council estimates that the net fiscal cost of \nthis massive immigration ranges from $11 billion to $22 billion per \nyear, with the infrastructure of our Nation--our schools, our health \ncare system, our transportation and energy networks--increasingly \nunable to absorb this untenable surge in the population.\n  Many tout the additional border and interior enforcement personnel \nauthorized since September 2001, but the President's budget has not \ncome anywhere close to funding those authorizations. Homeland security \nexpenditures have been capped at levels that prohibit the Congress from \nadequately filling the gaps. Senator Gregg and I have had to fight for \nevery additional nickel and dime that goes into our border security. It \nis never enough.\n  Immigration enforcement in the United States remains decidedly half-\nhearted. We are pulling our punches. Tougher border security mandates \nare signed into law, but then not fully funded. Statutory deadlines are \nset, but then indefinitely postponed. Undocumented aliens are denied \nSocial Security cards, but then issued driver's licenses and taxpayer \nidentification numbers. Employers are warned not to hire illegal labor, \nbut then allowed to sponsor, without penalty, their illegal workforce \nfor legal status. Funds are not requested to perform even the barest \nlevel of work site enforcement. We send troops abroad ostensibly so \nthat we don't have to fight terrorists on American streets, but then we \nturn a blind eye to millions of unauthorized, undocumented, unchecked \naliens--any one of whom could be a potential terrorist.\n  When lawmakers and the so-called pundits comment that our current \nsystem is unworkable, it's because we haven't really tried to make it \nwork. The contradictions in our immigration policies are undeniable. \nLawmakers decry illegal immigration, but then advocate amnesty \nproposals which only encourages more illegal immigration. Advocates may \ntry to distance themselves from that word--``amnesty''. They may \ncharacterize their proposals as ``guest worker'' programs or \n``temporary visas'', but the effect is the same--to waive the rules for \nlawbreakers, and to legalize the unlawful actions of undocumented \nworkers and the businesses that illegally employ them.\n  Amnesties are the dark and sinister underbelly of our immigration \nprocess. They tarnish the magnanimous promise of a better life \nenshrined on the base of the Statue of Liberty. They minimize the \nstruggle of all those who dutifully followed the rules to come to this \ncountry, and of all those who are still waiting abroad to immigrate \nlegally. Amnesties undermine that great egalitarian and American \nprinciple that the law should apply equally and fairly to everyone. \nAmnesties perniciously decree that the law shall apply to some, but not \nto all.\n  Amnesties can be dangerous, dangerous proposals. Amnesties open \nroutes to legal status for aliens hoping to circumvent the regular \nsecurity checks. By allowing illegal aliens to adjust their status in \nthe country, we allow them to bypass State Department checks normally \ndone overseas through the visa and consular process. One need only look \nto the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, where one of the terrorist \nleaders had legalized his status through an amnesty, to clearly see the \ndangers of these kinds of proposals.\n  Our immigration system is already plagued with funding and staffing \nproblems. It is overwhelmed on the borders, in the interior, and in its \nprocessing of immigration applications. It only took 19 temporary visa \nholders to slip through the system to unleash the horror of the \nSeptember 11 attacks. The pending proposal would shove 30 million legal \nand illegal aliens--many of whom have never gone through a background \ncheck--through our border security system, in effect, flooding a \nbureaucracy that is already drowning. It's a recipe for utter disaster.\n  Amnesties beget more illegal immigration--hurtful, destructive \nillegal immigration. They encourage other undocumented aliens to \ncircumvent our immigration process in the hope that they too can \nachieve temporary worker status. Amnesties sanction the exploitation of \nillegal foreign labor by U.S. businesses, and encourage other \nbusinesses to hire cheap and illegal labor in order to compete.\n  President Reagan signed his amnesty proposal into law in 1986. At the \ntime, I supported amnesty based on the same promises we hear today--\nthat legalizing undocumented workers and increasing enforcement would \nstem the flow of illegal immigration. It didn't work then, and it won't \nwork today. The 1986 amnesty failed miserably.\n\n[[Page S2795]]\n\nAfter 1986, illegal immigrant population tripled from 2.7 million \naliens, to 4 million aliens in 1996, to 8 million aliens in 2000, to an \nestimated 12 million illegal aliens today.\n  In that time, the Congress continued to enact amnesty after amnesty, \nwaiving the Immigration Act for lawbreakers. The result is always the \nsame: For every group of illegal aliens granted amnesty, a bigger group \nenters the country hoping to be similarly rewarded.\n  The pending substitute amendment embodies this same flawed model. \nIt's more of the same: More amnesties, more guest worker programs, more \nunfunded mandates on our immigration agencies. We ought to be focusing \non how to limit the incentives for illegal immigration, and erase the \ncontradictions in our immigration policies that encourage individuals \non both sides of the border to flout the law and get away with it.\n  What's backwards about the pending substitute amendment is that it is \nactually rewarding illegal aliens. It rewards illegal behavior. It \nauthorizes illegal aliens to work in the country. It grants illegal \naliens a path to citizenship. It pardons employers who illegally employ \nunauthorized workers. It even repeals provisions in current law \ndesigned to deny cheaper, in-state tuition rates to illegal aliens.\n  The pending amendment is a big welcome mat for illegal immigrants. It \nis a misguided and dangerous proposal that would doom this Congress to \nthe failures of previous Congresses.\n  The economist John Maynard Keynes once described the qualification \nfor an economist as being the ability to study the present, in the \nlight of the past, for the purpose of looking into the future. Patrick \nHenry echoed those sentiments more than a century earlier when he said:\n\n       I have but one lamp by which my feet are guided, and that \n     is the lamp of experience. I know of no way of judging the \n     future but by the past.\n\n  Our Nation's experience shows that amnesties do not work. They are \ndangerous proposals that reward and encourage illegal immigration. Our \nexperience shows that we cannot play games with our border security or \nAmerican lives could be lost.\n  I will oppose the Specter-Leahy substitute amendment, and I urge my \ncolleagues to do likewise.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation.

Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to \nhighlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  On March 18, 2006, in Savannah, GA, Travis McLain, was beaten by \nCharles Pickett in what appears to be a crime motivated by hate. McLain \nsuffered a concussion and lost several teeth when he was attacked in a \nlocal parking garage. McLain has stated that Pickett used anti-gay \nlanguage while attacking him. Georgia Equality, the state's largest gay \nrights organization is calling this attack an anti-gay hate crime.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/04/senate-section/article/S2795-3", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2795]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida.

Mr. President, today the Senate Energy and Natural \nResources Committee is holding a conference to delve into some of the \npolicy questions that have delayed efforts to move forward with \nlegislation addressing global warming. As many Americans have \nrealized--even in the face of an absolute void of leadership from this \ncurrent administration--one of the greatest challenges currently facing \nus is how to reduce our contributions to global climate change before \nit is too late for changes to matter. In fact, the majority of the \nAmerican public believes that they have an individual role to play in \nbeing a part of the solution. And the public is looking to us, their \nelected leaders, to provide the framework for change.\n  As many people know, Senators Lieberman and McCain have been the \nlongtime champions of raising awareness of global warming. Today's \nconference, under the leadership of Senators Domenici and Bingaman, \ndemonstrates that more and more elected officials are willing to take a \nstand in recognizing the imminent need for action. Along with my \nconstituents, I hope that the time will soon come when a majority of \nthe U.S. Congress is willing to follow their lead.\n  On the heels of today's conference, another Senate committee is \nscheduled to consider the issue of global warming. Tomorrow, the \nCommerce Committee's Global Climate Change and Impacts Subcommittee \nwill hear about the administration's approach to the issue. While the \nadministration favors developing and sharing new zero and low-carbon \ntechnologies with developing nations, I submit that our citizens are \nlooking for bold action that addresses more than how we will help \ndeveloping countries--they want to know what we plan to do \ndomestically.\n  Mr. President, if there ever was a time when it was all right to \nignore global warming, that time has long passed. We have got to get \nreal about this issue--and getting real will require a commitment to \nreducing our dependence on oil instead of continually talking about \nopening up a wildlife refuge for oil drilling. For, if we continue \nturning our backs on the reality of climate change, we might as well be \nturning our backs on our grandchildren--and this is why I am optimistic \nthat the Senate's treatment of global warming is nearing its own \ntipping point, a point after which we will provide the leadership that \nour constituents are increasingly expecting from us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/04/senate-section/article/S2795-5", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2795-S2796]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO TIM PETTY\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment and \nacknowledge the dedicated service of Tim Petty, director of information \nresources for the U.S. Senate Republican Conference, which I chair. Tim \nis moving on to become a Deputy Assistant Secretary at the U.S. \nDepartment of Interior, and today is his last day serving the Senate.\n  Since 1999, Tim has served as an integral team leader in the creation \nand development of the Internet technology department established by \nthe Senate Republican Conference. This department was created to help \nthe Conference implement a comprehensive technology strategy to help \nthe Republican leadership efficiently and effectively use evolving \nInternet communication capabilities.\n  Over the course of the past 7 years, Tim has led efforts and worked \nin collaboration with Senate and leadership offices in transforming the \nway the conference communicates and disseminates information using 21st \ncentury strategies and technology. Tim is always thinking of the next \nstep, the next tool, the next idea.\n\n[[Page S2796]]\n\n  Highlights of just a few of Tim's many accomplishments at the Senate \ninclude a 2002 overhaul of the leadership's Intranet, known as the \nTrunkLine. This successful redesign and restructuring of the Intranet \nenhanced the ability of staff members to find key information provided \nfrom the Leadership, which helps strengthen communication strategies \nand overall messaging. In 2004, the TrunkLine was recognized by a \nprominent Internet usability report as one the top 10 government \nIntranets in the world. Only 3 of the top 10 Intranets selected were \nfrom the United States.\n  In keeping with the vision of helping offices with their technology \nstrategies, Tim led an initiative involving online database access that \nallowed all Senate offices to develop their own dynamic Web sites. Many \noffices are now able to more fully manage their own Web sites and share \ninformation as a result of this effort.\n  One of Tim's primary objectives over the past 2 years has been \nenhancing the conference's ability to utilize wireless communications. \nA year ago the Republican Cloakroom began posting key legislative \nupdates to the TrunkLine which then generates notices to wireless \ndevices instantaneously when a legislative bill is hotlined. Prior to \nthis change, notifications were done through a telephone broadcast \nsystem.\n  Another technological communications tool Tim initiated for the \nconference is videoconferencing, which has allowed Senators to talk to \nState offices, meet with students in their classrooms, and to \nparticipate in conferences and meetings of constituents in real time.\n  Tim also recognized the value of blogging and has implemented a \nstrategy to reach beyond the usual media to take advantage of reaching \na new audience with the Republican message.\n  Tim's leadership in the area of technology strategy has been \ninvaluable to our conference. I appreciate his enthusiasm and tireless \nefforts to help move an institution known for holding onto traditions \ninto the 21st century. I wish him the very best in his new service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/04/senate-section/article/S2796-1", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2796]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  TRIBUTE TO KATHLEEN M. FOLEY BARRETT\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life and \nservice of an inspiring trooper from the Massachusetts State Police, \nKathleen M. Foley Barrett. Kathleen dedicated 27 years of her life to \nprotecting the people of Massachusetts, and I join her colleagues and \nfamily in paying tribute to a career defined by compassion, \nprofessionalism, and a sustained love of police work.\n  A native of Cambridge, MA, Kathleen was raised and educated in \nWeymouth. Initially she considered nursing school, but Kathleen's \npassion for police work started her on a career path that few women \nwere encouraged to follow at the time. Kathleen ultimately earned the \nchance to join the 62nd Recruit Training Troop in November 1980.\n  After working on the force for 5 years, Kathleen was promoted to the \nlevel of master trainer on the State Police K-9 Unit. She bonded \ninstantly with the specially trained canine teams and rose to such \nprominence that her expertise was called upon to lead seminars and \nprovide instruction on cadaver work. Beyond the borders of \nMassachusetts, Kathleen was called upon to help the Royal Canadian \nMounted Police and the rescue efforts following the September 11th \nterrorist attacks in New York. Two thousand four brought the \nunfortunate cancer diagnosis that would ultimately claim her, but even \nthat news could not keep her from coming to the aid of her fellow \ncitizens in the wake of Hurricane Katrina.\n  Kathleen loved police work, and her colleagues loved her. Over the \ncourse of her career she belonged to the State Police Association of \nMassachusetts, the North American Police Work Dog Association, and the \nInternational Association of Police Work Dogs. Her love of animals \ndefined her private life as well as her professional one, and she \nenjoyed swimming with manatees and feeding bottleneck tigers at \nFlorida's Amazing Exotics Education Center.\n  As the cancer progressed and the end approached, law enforcement \nofficers from around the Commonwealth and across the country made sure \nKathleen knew how much she was valued and respected. State Police \nColonel Thomas G. Robbins honored her at her bedside with the Colonel's \nAward of Excellence, a tribute bestowed on only seven troopers in \nMassachusetts history. Officers of every stripe bowed their heads upon \nnews of her death on March 23, 2006.\n  Mr. President, Kathleen's characteristic perseverance stands as an \ninspiration and challenge to us all. She lived an American life, one of \nservice and struggle, and throughout it all she was guided by an \nunshakable commitment to her family, her job, and her colleagues. We \nare thankful for her time with us, we are better for her time here, and \nI join every Massachusetts State trooper in serving witness to the loss \nof an exemplary law enforcement officer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/04/senate-section/article/S2796-2", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2796]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               HONORING THE COLORADO UNIVERSITY SKI TEAM\n\n Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I am honored to recognize the \nUniversity of Colorado--CU--ski team for claiming their 17th national \nski championship title at the 53rd Annual NCAA Championship. I am also \nextremely proud that the CU ski team has been invited to participate in \nthe National Student-Athlete Day activities at the White House on April \n6. This is an incredible honor for these young athletes, their coaches, \ntheir parents, and the University of Colorado.\n  The CU ski team overcame insurmountable odds to claim their 17th \nnational ski championship. This year's ski team was the first team in \nU.S. history to win the national title without a full 12-skier team. \nThis year's team broke and set the largest comeback record in NCAA ski \nteam history--winning the title after being ranked sixth following the \nfirst full day of competition. Battling injury, illness, and an \nunderdog status, the CU ski team went on to claim a national victory \nwith a 98-point lead--the fourth largest margin of victory in NCAA ski \nteam history. CU team skiers also claimed four individual titles and \neight All-American honors. These team members deserve national \nrecognition for their focus, determination, and spirit.\n  It is this team's spirit, leadership, and record of achievement that \nwill be honored by President Bush on National Student-Athlete Day, this \nApril 6th. The CU ski team is being honored for their excellence in \nacademics and athletics as well as for their contributions to their \ncommunity. National Student-Athlete Day also represents an opportunity \nto recognize the parents, teachers, and coaches who have helped mold \nand challenge these outstanding student-athletes. This honor is \nrepresentative of the University of Colorado under the outstanding \nleadership and commitment of University president Hank Brown, CU \nathletic director Mike Bohn, and Colorado ski team head coach Richard \nRokos. Due to the talent, dedication, and leadership of the CU \nathletes, coaches, and university leadership, the University of \nColorado is back on top of the collegiate skiing world.\n  Congratulations to the University of Colorado, the ski team, the \ncoaches, and the community that has supported this team throughout this \nwinning, landmark season.\n  On behalf of the State of Colorado, I am proud to honor and \ncommemorate the University of Colorado's ski team and request that my \ncolleagues join me in paying tribute to the University of Colorado and \nthese outstanding young men and women.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/04/senate-section/article/S2796-3", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2796-S2797]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             LADY BULLDOGS\n\n Mr. THUNE.

The \nMadison gymnastics program is currently in second place nationally for \nmost consecutive victories and is now just one win shy of the national \nrecord.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor and recognize \na man who has dedicated his life to education, Mr. Robert Cleverly. Bob \nwas responsible for establishing the Close-up Foundation program at \nEnnis High School and has been involved in the program for over 20 \nyears. During those years he has also been instrumental in establishing \nthe Close-up program in numerous Montana schools. Bob was chosen by the \nClose-up Foundation in 1996 and 1997 and awarded the Linda Myers Chozen \nAward for Teaching Excellence in Civic Education. This award honors \nteachers and administrators who have demonstrated outstanding \nleadership, innovation, and commitment to the foundation's citizenship \nmission. In addition to his Close-up advocacy, Bob was a history \nteacher at Ennis High School for 38 years and is credited with \norganizing the first aid and CPR program. Bob was active in the \nschool's extra curricular activities as a very successful football \ncoach, taking several teams to statewide level competition and winning \ntwo State championships. As a result of his coaching abilities and team \norganization skills, Bob was inducted into the Montana Coaches Hall of \nFame.\n  Education is crucial to the future of America, and it is teachers \nlike Bob who make education their priority, devoting their life to the \nfuture of our youth. Bob has been taking students to Washington, DC, \nfor over 20 years with the Close-up program, giving students of Montana \na firsthand view on how our Federal Government works, while \nexperiencing the history our Nation's Capital has to offer. At great \nloss to Montana's high school students, this will be Bob's last year in \nthe Close-up program, but thanks to his hard work, many Montana \nstudents for years to come will be able to explore our Nation's Capital \nthrough the Close-up program.

BARBIERI\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, today I mark the passing of a great \nHoosier newspaperman and civic leader, James C. Barbieri.\n  My condolences go out to his wife Barbara, his son Chuck, his \ndaughter Cindi, and his four grandchildren and one great grandchild. \nThey shared this remarkable man with the wonderful community of \nBluffton, IN, which also mourns his passing.\n  Beginning in 1950, Jim Barbieri worked almost every job conceivable \nat the Bluffton, IN, News-Banner. He was a reporter, advertising \nsalesman, and circulation director. He became general manager of the \nvenerable Wells County publication in 1975 and then coowner, president, \nand publisher in 1986.\n  It was not unusual that on any given day he might write every page-1 \nstory, the editorial, and if someone called in sick, he would pick up a \ndelivery route, too. He was always available because he only missed 1 \nday of work over a 50-year stretch.\n  Born and raised in Park Ridge, IL, he attended DePauw University in \nIndiana where he was editor of the student newspaper. After serving his \ncountry in the Army during the Korean War, Jim worked briefly at The \nChicago American before coming to Bluffton.\n  In 2005, the Hoosier State Press Association awarded Jim the Charlie \nBiggs Commitment to Community Award.\n  Jim Barbieri had that venerable smalltown newspaperman ready opinion \non virtually everything that passes us by in life. Whether it was \nroads, parks, or the time Indiana should set its clocks in the summer, \nJim used his unique forum to editorialize.

Mr. President. I rise today in recognition of \nAnthony Felicia, Jr., upon his retirement as vice president of R and \nclinical administration for AstraZeneca. Tony's dedication and ability \nhave won him the respect of friends and coworkers alike, along with the \ngratitude of many in the first State. He has been, and remains, a \ntrusted friend of Delaware.\n  A native of Syracuse, NY, Tony was born on August 26, 1950, to \nAnthony and Maryann Felicia. He received his bachelor's degree from the \nState University of New York and completed his master's degree at \nSyracuse University.\n  Tony has been with AstraZeneca and the former Zeneca Pharmaceuticals \nand ICI for 28 years and has worked in operations, quality assurance, \nsupply chain management, facilities and engineering, production \noperations, and international planning. Prior to Tony's employment with \nICI in 1978, he worked for Bristol Laboratories in Syracuse, NY, from \n1973 to 1977, where he held various quality assurance and production \npositions.\n  Throughout his career, Tony has provided strong leadership and served \nas a role model to many. One of the numerous highlights of his \noutstanding career was the pivotal role he played in helping to bring \nAstraZeneca's U.S. headquarters to Delaware during my time as Governor. \nI will always remember how Tony's main concern was making sure that the \nmove was the right decision for his fellow employees and their \nfamilies, as well as for shareholders. His hard work and down-to-earth \npersonality made him a pleasure to work with during this critically \nimportant time. Both AstraZeneca and the first State are better off \nbecause of his efforts.\n  While his professional accomplishments are worthy of our admiration, \nit is within his personal life that Tony truly stands as an example to \nus all. Tony has volunteered a great deal of his time to support a \nnumber of nonprofit and business organizations within the Delaware \ncommunity, including Easter Seals, Delaware Technology Park, and the \nAmerican Heart Association. Tony is currently in his sixth year of \nservice as the president of the board of trustees for the Delaware \nMuseum of Natural History. He also served on the Newark City Council \nfrom 1992 to 1998.\n  His leisure interests include playing golf, helping his children, and \nenjoying the beauty of Delaware at his beach house in Bethany. Now that \nhe has more free time, Tony plans to spend\n\n[[Page S2798]]\n\nmore time with his parents in Syracuse, NY. He also is starting a \ncorporate consulting company and will remain active within the Delaware \nbusiness community.\n  Tony lives with his wife Susan in Hockessin, DE. They have five \nchildren, Brian, Carrie, Heather, Meghan, and Dylan.\n  Through his tireless efforts, Tony Felicia has made a positive \ndifference in the lives of thousands of individuals and enhanced the \nquality of life for our State. Upon his retirement, he will leave \nbehind a legacy of commitment to public service for both his children \nand for generations that will follow. I thank him for the friendship \nthat we share, and I congratulate him on a truly remarkable and \ndistinguished career. I wish him and his family only the very best in \nall that lies ahead for each of them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/04/senate-section/article/S2798-1", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2798]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HONORING DR. CARL TAYLOR\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to make some remarks \ntoday about a committed and pioneering individual, Dr. Carl Taylor, the \nassistant dean and director of the Center for Strategic Health \nInnovation at the University of South Alabama. Dr. Taylor earned a \nbachelor's degree in political science from Marshall University, a \njuris doctor from the University of Miami, and is a Fellow at the Royal \nInstitution in London. He serves on the State of Alabama's Department \nof Public Health bioterrorism advisory board and has been the principal \ninvestigator on nearly a dozen disaster related grants, including the \ngrant that developed the Alabama incident management software system \nwhich he superbly presented recently to the Senate Subcommittee on \nBioterrorism and Public Health Preparedness.\n  This software system, referred to as AIMS, is an online hospital \nsurge capacity and surge capability management tool used to support \npublic health efforts during large-scale disaster response. This easy-\nto-use system shows which hospitals have available beds, staff, and \nequipment in real time while allowing hospitals to request help or \noffer assistance to one another. During Hurricane Katrina, AIMS was the \nsoftware tool used by the Alabama Department of Public Health to manage \ninformation from 83 hospitals and 7 medical needs shelters. AIMS was \nvital to Alabama's outstanding performance in delivering quality \nmedical care to vulnerable individuals in a time of crisis.\n  I commend Dr. Taylor for his leadership and creativity in developing \nthis system that has application for the entire country. His work has \nthe potential to save lives and reduce cost. This spirit of ingenuity \nis what keeps America strong.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/04/senate-section/article/S2798-2", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2798]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/04/senate-section/article/S2798-3", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2798]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EXECUTIVE MESSAGE REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \na message from the President of the United States submiting a treaty \nwhich was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n\n  With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to \nratification, I transmit herewith the Treaty between the United States \nand the Oriental Republic of Uruguay Concerning the Encouragement and \nReciprocal Protection of Investment, with Annexes and Protocol, signed \nat Mar del Plata, Argentina, on November 4, 2005. I transmit also, for \nthe information of the Senate, the report prepared by the Department of \nState with respect to the Treaty.\n  The Treaty is the first bilateral investment treaty (BIT) concluded \nsince 1999 and the first negotiated on the basis of a new U.S. model \nBIT text, which was completed in 2004. The new model text draws on \nlong-standing U.S. BIT principles, our experience with Chapter 11 of \nthe North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and the executive \nbranch's collaboration with the Congress in developing negotiating \nobjectives on foreign investment for U.S. free trade agreements. The \nTreaty will establish investment protections that will create more \nfavorable conditions for U.S. investment in Uruguay and assist Uruguay \nin its efforts to further develop its economy.\n  The Treaty is fully consistent with U.S. policy towards international \nand domestic investment. A specific tenet of U.S. investment policy, \nreflected in this Treaty, is that U.S. investment abroad and foreign \ninvestment in the United States should receive national treatment and \nmost-favored-nation treatment. Under this Treaty, the Parties also \nagree to customary international law standards for expropriation and \nfor the minimum standard of treatment. The Treaty includes detailed \nprovisions regarding the computation and payment of prompt, adequate, \nand effective compensation for expropriation; free transfer of funds \nrelated to investment; freedom of investment from specified performance \nrequirements; and the opportunity of investors to choose to resolve \ndisputes with a host government through international arbitration. The \nTreaty also includes extensive transparency obligations with respect to \nnational laws and regulations, and commitments to transparency and \npublic participation in dispute settlement. The Parties also recognize \nthat it is inappropriate to encourage investment by weakening or \nreducing the protections afforded in domestic environmental and labor \nlaws.\n  I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to \nthe Treaty and give its advice and consent to ratification.\n                                                      George W.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nprohibit the disclosure of tax return information by tax return \npreparers to third parties; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce a taxpayer \nprivacy bill.\n  Much attention has been focused recently on IRS-proposed changes to \nregulations regarding taxpayer privacy. Interestingly, these proposed \nchanges have been widely--and incorrectly--reported as changing the law \nto allow tax preparers to sell taxpayer information to third parties \nfor marketing purposes. In fact, an IRS regulation put into place more \nthan 30 years ago already allows confidential taxpayer information to \nbe shared in this manner, as long as the taxpayer consents.\n  The public uproar that has surrounded the proposed changes to this \nregulation makes it clear that taxpayers are not aware of this fact and \nexpect that their return information will be kept confidential. \nConfidentiality of taxpayer information is a key underpinning of our \nvoluntary tax system, encouraging taxpayers to provide complete and \nhonest returns.\n  The complexity of the tax code has resulted in 60 percent of all \nreturns being completed by paid preparers. The process is a very \nintimidating one for most. Given the stress and vulnerability of \ntaxpayers during the process, and the high dollar value of confidential \ntaxpayer information, I am concerned that financially-motivated tax \npreparers may present the taxpayer with a stack of papers for the \ntaxpayer to sign, including, unbeknownst to the taxpayer, a consent \nform to share the information with third parties. The taxpayer could \neasily be under the impression that all of the papers are required to \nbe signed in order to have the return prepared, completely undermining \nthe requirement of signed, informed consent.\n  In an era of lightning-fast electronic communication--in which \ninformation can travel around the world and back in a matter of \nseconds--and the proliferation of identity theft, it seems to me that \nwe ought to bring the law in line with taxpayer expectations. When this \nregulation was promulgated back in 1974, our citizens weren't anywhere \nnearly as vulnerable to this crime as they are today. We have made \nchanges with regard to credit reports and individuals' access to them, \nwe have removed Social Security numbers from drivers' licenses and \nmedical ID cards, and we need to similarly remove the threat of \ntaxpayer information being shared in ways that are not condoned by the \nindividual taxpayer. This bill would do just that by prohibiting tax \npreparers from both soliciting consent and sharing tax return \ninformation with third parties.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2498\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PROHIBITION OF TAX PREPARERS DISCLOSING TAX RETURN \n                   INFORMATION.\n\n       (a) In General.--Paragraph (3) of section 7216(b) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to regulations) is \n     amended to read as follows:\n       ``(3) Regulations.--\n       ``(A) In general.--Subsection (a) shall not apply to a \n     disclosure or use of information which is permitted by \n     regulations prescribed by the Secretary under this section.\n\n[[Page S2802]]\n\n       ``(B) Peer reviews.--The regulations under this section \n     shall permit (subject to such conditions as such regulations \n     shall provide) the disclosure or use of information for \n     quality or peer reviews.\n       ``(C) Disclosure to third parties.--\n       ``(i) In general.--The regulations under this section shall \n     not permit the disclosure or use of information for purposes \n     of facilitating the solicitation of the taxpayer's use of any \n     services provided or facilities furnished by a person \n     unless--\n\n       ``(I) such person is a person described in subsection (a) \n     or a person who is a member of the same affiliated group \n     (within the meaning of section 1504) as such person, and\n       ``(II) the taxpayer has granted consent to such disclosure \n     or use.\n\n       ``(ii) Solicitation of consent.--The regulations under this \n     section shall not permit any person described in clause \n     (i)(I) to request the consent of a taxpayer to disclose or \n     use information for any purpose other than a purpose \n     described in clause (i).''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section \n     shall take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY:\n  S. 2499. A bill to provide for the expeditious disclosure of records \nrelevant to the life and assassination of Reverend Doctor Martin Luther \nKing, Jr.; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today, on the anniversary of Dr. Martin \nLuther King, Jr.'s assassination, I am pleased to join with my \ncolleague in the House, Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney to introduce the \nMartin Luther King, Jr., Record Collections Act. This act will ensure \nthe expeditious disclosure and preservation of records relevant to Dr. \nKing's life and death. Fully releasing these records--many of which are \nnot subject to disclosure until 2038--will shed significant light on a \nturning point in American history. My friend, Representative John \nLewis, explained its necessity quite eloquently:\n\n       I, too, was the subject of unwarranted FBI surveillance \n     during the Civil Rights Movement. Because we do not know this \n     part of our history, it is clear that we are beginning to \n     repeat it. Recently, we became aware of the administration's \n     domestic spying program that has targeted peace groups that \n     are carrying on the nonviolent action of Dr. King. It is time \n     that we know our history, and passage of the Rev. Martin \n     Luther King, Jr. Records Act will take us one step closer to \n     uncovering that history.\n\n  Judge Joseph Brown, the last presiding judge in James Earl Ray's \npost-conviction relief proceedings, also supports this legislation. He \nbelieves that it is important to:\n\n       . . . fully release the still classified historical record \n     surrounding the life and death of the late Dr. King. In light \n     of the disturbing records and documents that came to light in \n     James Earl Ray's petition before me and in consideration of \n     the recent furor over the power and authority granted to \n     certain officials under the guise of the Homeland Security \n     Act, it might prove most illuminating to review the \n     historical record relative to the exercise of purportedly \n     similar power and authority by the U.S. officials 40 years \n     ago. The American public, the citizens of the Land of the \n     Free and Home of the Brave deserve this access to the \n     historic record surrounding the life and death of Dr. King.\n\n  Our legislation will create a Martin Luther King Records Collection \nat the National Archives. This will include all records--public and \nprivate--related to the life and death of Dr. King, including any \ninvestigations or inquiries by Federal, State, or local agencies. The \nrecords will be organized in a central directory to allow the public to \naccess them online from anywhere in the world. The documents will be \noverseen by a review board consisting of at least one professional \nhistorian, one attorney, one researcher, and one representative of the \ncivil rights community.\n  The MLK Records Review Board, a five-member independent agency, will \nbe responsible for facilitating the review and transmission of all \nrelated records to the Archivist for public disclosure. Members will be \nnominated by the President and approved with the advice and consent of \nthe Senate. It will have the power to direct government offices to \nlocate and organize related records and transmit them for review or \nrelease. It will also have the power to investigate the facts \nsurrounding the transmission or possession of records, take testimony \nof individuals in order to fulfill their responsibilities, request the \nAttorney General to subpoena private persons or government employees to \ncompel testimony or records and require agencies to account in writing \nfor any previous or current destruction of related records. In \naddition, the Board can request that the Attorney General petition any \ncourt in the U.S. or abroad to release any sealed information or \nphysical evidence relevant to the life or death of Dr. King, and to \nsubpoena such evidence if it is no longer in the possession of the \ngovernment. The MLK Records Review Board will also be required to \nprovide annual reports to Congress, the President, the Archivist, and \nall government agencies whose records have been reviewed, and to the \npublic. The Board must terminate its work no later than 5 years from \nthe passage of the Act unless it votes to extend for an additional 2-\nyear term.\n\n  The reason for having such a Board is to ensure that someone is \nresponsible for finding all relevant records and that the records do \nnot disclose any sensitive information. It is particularly important to \nhave a Board like this given recent revelations by the New York Times \nthat the government has begun removing thousands of declassified \ndocuments on a wide range of historical subjects from public access at \nthe National Archives. There has perhaps never been a more urgent time \nto bring the records on Dr. King into the light of day. According to \nthe National Archives, about 9,500 records totaling more than 55,000 \npages have been withdrawn from the public shelves and reclassified \nsince 1999. We need to ensure that the records relating to the life and \ndeath of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., do not suffer the same fate. They \nare too important to us at this point in American history.\n  Dr. King challenged the conscience of my generation, and his words \nand his legacy continue to move generations to action today. His love \nand faith is alive in the millions of Americans who volunteer each day \nin soup kitchens or in schools, and those who refused to ignore the \nsuffering of thousands they'd never met when Hurricane Katrina \ndestroyed lives and communities. His vision and his passion are alive \nin churches and on campuses when millions stand up against the \ninjustice of discrimination or the indifference that leaves too many \nbehind.\n  The best way to honor the memory of Dr. King is to finish his work at \nhome and around the world. And the first step to furthering his legacy \nis to know the full body of it. I hope that my colleagues will join me \nin this very important effort: to preserve and learn from records \nrelating to the life and death of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Lautenberg, and Mr. \n        Kerry):\n  S. 2500. A bill to enhance the counseling and readjustment services \nprovided by the Department of Veterans Affairs, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise proudly today on behalf of our \nNation's veterans and returning servicemembers to introduce the Healing \nthe Invisible Wounds Act of 2006. This legislation will enhance the \ncounseling and readjustment services provided by the Department of \nVeterans' Affairs (VA). And it will protect the rights of veterans to \nreceive PTSD compensation--now or in the future.\n  Many of the men and women who served in Iraq and Afghanistan are \nsuffering from some of the most severe physical injuries. However, even \nmore of these brave servicemembers have invisible wounds--difficulties \nwith adjusting to not being on the battlefield or dealing with long-\nlasting visions and experiences that they encountered. My bill is \nintended to ensure that these men and women receive the readjustment \ncounseling and mental health services necessary to transition into what \nwe hope to be a full and productive life after combat.\n  This issue is especially relevant following the release of a mental \nhealth care study conducted by the Army Institute of Research which \nrevealed that as many as 35 percent of Iraq war veterans received \nmental health care services in the year after their return home. The \nstudy concluded that the high rate of using of mental health care \nservices among Operation Iraqi Freedom veterans after deployment \nhighlights challenges in ensuring that there be adequate resources to \nmeet the mental health needs of returning veterans.\n  As we all know, the transition period for these soldiers is extremely \ncritical. So critical that it can, in some cases, mean the difference \nbetween short-\n\n[[Page S2803]]\n\nterm readjustment issues and severely chronic psychological conditions. \nThis bill supports and encourages greater cooperation between VA and \nthe Department of Defense, DoD, through the expansion of innovative \nReunion and Re-entry activities carried out by Vet Center staff. These \nactivities provide members of the National Guard and Reserves with \ncounseling services during the transition from their deployment \noverseas to civilian life.\n  Demobilization often occurs so rapidly for these returning \nservicemembers that they sometimes do not receive or are overwhelmed by \nthe benefits information they need. It is understandable that our \nservicemembers are much more focused on being reunited with their loved \nones than caring about what benefits they are eligible to receive. My \nbill provides a comprehensive approach by providing group session \ncounseling, a one-hour private counseling session, a presentation to \nfamily members about counseling-related matters, and other services \nthat are deemed appropriate by the Secretaries of Veterans Affairs and \nDefense. My bill ensures that these services are provided no later than \n14 days upon return and that servicemembers be retained on active duty \nuntil they receive these crucial counseling services.\n\n  In order to provide feedback and reflection about how to better serve \nveterans in this capacity, my bill requires a report from VA. The \nreport would detail the costs associated with the provision of \ncounseling services, an assessment of the efficacy of the services \nprovided to meet the readjustment needs of veterans, and a survey-based \nassessment regarding the satisfaction of veterans receiving these \nservices, that would include the manner in which these services are \nprovided.\n  Servicemembers have paid a great price in defending freedom. Access \nto treatment and counseling to heal invisible wounds must be considered \na continuing cost of war. In that spirit, this legislation would \nauthorize $180 million for the provision of readjustment counseling \nservices. Colleagues, if there's one lesson we've learned thus far, it \nis that the earlier we provide these services, the better chance we \nhave of preventing more serious mental health conditions. We need to \ninvest in our future now. If we don't provide these services, we will \nbe paying a much, much higher price in the future.\n  The safe counseling havens of VA include Vet Centers, which are great \nconduits for the delivery of these types of transition activities. All \nVet Centers are staffed by veterans who can relate to the experiences \nthat these OIF/OEF veterans commonly share.\n  In 2005, Vet Centers cared for more than 44,900 veterans of the \nGlobal War on Terrorism in Afghanistan and Iraq. In addition, Vet \nCenters provided bereavement counseling to more than 800 surviving \nfamily members of over 525 servicemembers who were killed while on \nactive duty serving their country. Despite increases in the number of \nveterans coming to Vet Centers for care, the budget for the program has \nremained relatively stagnant.\n  My bill would also address PTSD benefits for veterans. Instead of \nbeing proactive and allocating resources to address these challenges \nwhile at the same time caring for older veterans, a fear of rising \ncosts prompted a reactionary response from many in Washington. Some \npolicy makers believe that reducing veterans' compensation for PTSD by \nreexamining 72,000 previously awarded claims might be a good way to \nsave money. This is a bad idea.\n  Many times, VA compensation is the only source of income for severely \ndisabled veterans and their families. I am thankful that VA set aside \nits plan to move forward with the PTSD Review late last year. However, \nthere are ongoing efforts to re-evaluate how PTSD is compensated. The \nInstitute of Medicine and Disability Benefits Commission are currently \nreviewing veterans' disability compensation. This bill requires the \nSecretary of Veterans Affairs to submit a report to Congress 6 months \nprior to modifying how PTSD is compensated under the disability \ncompensation rating system. Veterans will no longer have to worry that \nthe administration will cut disability compensation in order to save \nmoney.\n  Through budget shortfalls and constraints, we must remain steadfast \nin ensuring that our servicemembers and their families do not suffer in \nsilence from the invisible wounds that they receive in the name of \nfreedom. Many of us fail to give invisible wounds the attention they \nrequire. I urge my colleagues to join me in taking another step towards \nhealing our veterans by enacting this important measure.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2500\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Healing the Invisible Wounds \n     Act of 2006''.\n\n     SEC. 2. NOTICE AND WAIT ON MODIFICATION OF HANDLING OF POST-\n                   TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER UNDER DISABILITY \n                   COMPENSATION RATING SYSTEM.\n\n       The Secretary of Veterans Affairs may not implement any \n     modification in the manner in which Post-Traumatic Stress \n     Disorder (PTSD) is handled in the rating of service-connected \n     disabilities for purposes of the payment of compensation \n     under chapter 11 of title 38, United States Code, until the \n     date that is six months after the date on which the Secretary \n     submits to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the Senate \n     and House of Representatives a report on such proposed \n     modification.\n\n     SEC. 3.

FUNDING FOR VET CENTERS.\n\n       There is authorized to be appropriated to the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs for fiscal year 2007, $180,000,000 for the \n     provision of readjustment counseling and related mental \n     health services through centers (commonly referred to as \n     ``vet centers'') under section 1712A of title 38, United \n     States Code.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH (for himself and Mr. Wyden):\n  S. 2502. A bill to provide for the modification of an amendatory \nrepayment contract between the Secretary of the Interior and the North \nUnit Irrigation District, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nwill provide a win-win for the environment and for the farmers and \nranchers who receive their irrigation water from the North Unit \nIrrigation District in central Oregon. My colleague, Senator Ron Wyden, \njoins me in cosponsoring this bill. Companion legislation is also being \nintroduced today in the House of Representatives by Congressman Greg \nWalden.\n  This legislation represents an opportunity to benefit nearly nine \nhundred farm and ranch families as well as the fish and wildlife \nresources of the Deschutes and Crooked Rivers. It will do so by \nremoving a limitation in North Unit's Federal water contract with the \nBureau of Reclamation. This limitation prevents the Distict and its \npatrons from participating in a conserved water project pursuant to the \nlaws of the State of Oregon.\n  Removing this contract restriction will enable North Unit to conserve \nits water supplies further through the implementation of conserved \nwater projects. In order to comply with State law, the District would \nreturn a specific percentage of the ``conserved'' water back to the \nDeschutes River permanently as instream flows for fish, wildlife, or \nother purposes. A related change would enable the District to use \nDeschutes Project water on acreage in its service area that is \ncurrently irrigated with Crooked River water. The savings from these \ntwo changes could ultimately allow the District to reduce its reliance \non its privately developed Crooked River supplies.\n  Located in central Oregon's Deschutes Basin, the farm and ranch \nfamilies of the North Unit Irrigation District are the embodiment of \nthe Federal Reclamation program. Working small and medium parcels of \nland, they raise grass seed, carrot seed, and alfalfa hay, as well as \ncattle, sheep, and horses. The overriding limitation to their ability \nto compete successfully in the international marketplace is a shortage \nor water. For these families, conservation is the most efficient means \nto alleviate their shortage and succeed in the market.\n  After self-financing over eight million dollars in canal lining and \nother measures to increase the efficiency of their limited water \nsupplies, North Unit would like to participate in a state water \nconservation program. Unfortunately, the District's Federal contract \nprevents it from doing so. This point has been confirmed to me by \nofficials with the Bureau of Reclamation, an agency of the Department \nof the Interior. Therefore, North Unit's contract must be amended. \nSince Congress actually legislatively executed the District's contract \nin a 1954 statute, it is Congress, and not the Department of the \nInterior, that must remove this contract restriction.\n  These targeted contract changes are specific to the North Unit \nIrrigation District's contract. For the landowners served by the \nDistrict, these changes will enable them to use their water resources \nmore efficiently, maintain their competitiveness in the market, and \nbenefit the fish and wildlife resources of both the Deschutes and \nCrooked Rivers. Our efforts are supported by the Oregon Water Resources \nDepartment, which has jurisdiction over State water rights issues. I \nurge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I will press for \nits timely consideration.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. LINCOLN (for herself and Mr. Thomas):\n  S. 2503. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor an extension of the period of limitation to file claims for refunds \non account of disability determinations by the Department of Veterans \nAffairs; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague, Senator \nCraig Thomas, to introduce the Disabled Veterans Tax Fairness Act. This \nmuch-needed legislation would protect disabled veterans from being \nunfairly taxed on the benefits to which they are entitled, simply \nbecause their disability claims were not processed in a timely manner. \nThis legislation is supported by the Military Coalition, a group \nrepresenting more than 5.5 million members of the uniformed services \nand their families.\n  While the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) resolves most of its \nfiled disability claims in less than a year, there are also instances \nof lost paperwork, administrative errors, and appeals of rejected \nclaims that often delay thousands of disability awards for years on \nend. When this occurs, disability compensation is awarded retroactively \nand for tax purposes, a disabled veteran's previously received taxable \nmilitary retiree pay is re-designated as nontaxable disability \ncompensation. Thereby, the disabled veteran is entitled to a refund of \ntaxes paid and must file an amended tax return for each applicable \nyear.\n  Unfortunately, under current law the IRS Code bars the filing of \namended returns beyond the last three tax years. As a result, many of \nour disabled veterans are denied the opportunity to file a claim for \nrepayment of additional years of back taxes already paid--through no \nfault of their own--even though the IRS owes them a refund for the \ntaxes that were originally paid on their retiree pay.\n  The Disabled Veterans Tax Fairness Act of 2006 would add an exception \nto the IRS statute of limitations for amending returns. This exception \nwould allow disabled military retirees whose disability claims have \nbeen pending for more than 3 years to receive refunds on previous taxes \npaid for all the years their claim was pending. Specifically, the bill \nwould extend the IRS three year period of limitation for amending \nreturns to one year from the date a VA determination is issued.\n  My father and grandfather both served our Nation in uniform and they \ntaught me from an early age about the sacrifices our troops and their \nfamilies have made to keep our Nation free. This is particularly true \nfor our disabled veterans. During a time when a grateful Nation should \nbe doing everything it can to honor those who have sacrificed so \ngreatly on our behalf, the very least it can do is ensure they and \ntheir families are not unjustly penalized simply because of \nbureaucratic inefficiencies or administrative delays which are beyond \ntheir control. This situation is unacceptable and our veterans deserve \nbetter.\n  That is why I am proud to introduce this legislation today to provide \nrelief to our Nation's veterans. It is the least we can do for those \nwhom we owe so much, and it is the least we can do to reassure future \ngenerations that a grateful Nation will not forget them when their \nmilitary service is complete.\n\n[[Page S2805]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. OBAMA (for himself, Mr. Durbin, Mrs. Clinton, and Mr. \n        Kerry):\n  S. 2506. A bill to require Federal agencies to support health impact \nassessments and take other actions to improve health and the \nenvironmental quality of communities, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, this is National Public Health Week, and \nthe American Public Health Association and its over 200 partner \norganizations and sponsors have organized events to raise awareness \nabout the importance of public health in this nation. This year, the \ntheme of National Public Health Week, ``Designing Healthy Communities: \nRaising Healthy Kids,'' focuses on building healthy communities to \npromote and protect the health of our children.\n  This focus on building healthy communities is both timely and \ncritical. We are losing ground with respect to the health of our \nNation's children. Studies have found that the percentage of overweight \nchildren and adolescents has more than doubled in the last few decades; \nwithout intervention, 1 in 3 children born in 2000 can expect to \ndevelop diabetes in their lifetime. My home State of Illinois has the \nunfortunate distinction of having the highest number of lead-poisoned \nchildren. And other diseases and conditions, including high blood \npressure and asthma, are on the rise in young populations.\n  As bleak as the health situation is for so many children, there is \ngood news. Many of these diseases and health conditions are completely \npreventable or can be delayed for many, many years. The American Public \nHealth Association and countless other expert organizations have told \nus, and shown us, that if we make a real commitment to and investment \nin building healthy communities, we can substantially improve the \nhealth of our children and adults. Today I am introducing the Healthy \nPlaces Act of 2006, which will do just that.\n  The Healthy Places Act of 2006 focuses on the built environment, \nwhich includes our homes, schools, workplaces, parks and recreation \nareas, business areas, and transportation systems. Where we work, live, \nand play has tremendous implications for our health, and improvements \nto these environments will lead to: greater opportunities for physical \nactivity and a reduction in injuries because of safe sidewalks, biking \npaths, and parks; less reliance on personal automobiles which reduces \ntoxic emissions; better access to fresh fruits and vegetables which \nleads to healthier nutrition; and the planning and building of \n``green'' homes and buildings which decreases energy consumption.\n  Like many other States, Illinois has already begun to take steps to \nimprove the environment. City leaders in Chicago have recognized that \nmany low-income families have no access to fresh foods and medicine \nbecause there are no grocery stores and pharmacies in their \nneighborhoods. Retail Chicago, an initiative of the city's Department \nof Planning and Development, is now using redevelopment funds to entice \nlocal developers to bring grocery stores and pharmacies into these \nneighborhoods.\n  The Lieutenant Governor's initiative ``Six Weeks to a Greener \nIllinois'' is another fine example. Now in its 4th week, this effort \nhas encouraged Illinoisans to participate in making the State a \nhealthier place to live, and rewarded those communities that are \nalready taking steps to do so.\n  The Healthy Places Act of 2006 would expand these and other efforts \nto improve the planning and design of communities that can promote \nhealthier living. It establishes and supports health impact assessment \nprograms, which would assist States and local communities in examining \npotential health effects of major health policy or programmatic \nchanges. The newly created Interagency Working Group on Environmental \nHealth would facilitate communication and collaboration on projects \namong the agencies in order to better address environmental health \nissues. In addition, the bill creates a grant program to address \nenvironmental health hazards, particularly those that contribute to \nhealth disparities. Finally, the Healthy Places Act provides additional \nsupport for research on the relationship between the built environment \nand the health status of residents as recommended by two Institute of \nMedicine's reports: ``Does the Built Environment Influence Physical \nActivity?'' and ``Rebuilding the Unity of Health and the Environment: A \nNew Vision of Environmental Health for the 21st Century''.\n  As the health of our children continues to decline, and our health \nexpenditures continue to soar, it is imperative that the Congress take \naction, and focusing on building healthier communities is a necessary \nstep in this regard. I encourage all of my colleagues to join me and \nsupport passage of this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/04/senate-section/article/S2805-1", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2805-S2806]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 421--CALLING ON THE GOVERNMENT OF AFGHANISTAN TO \n  UPHOLD FREEDOM OF RELIGION AND URGING THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED \n           STATES TO PROMOTE RELIGIOUS FREEDOM IN AFGHANISTAN\n\n  Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Biden, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. \nKerry, Mr. Salazar, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Nelson of Florida, \nMr. Inhofe, and Mr. Coleman) submitted the following resolution; which \nwas considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 421\n\n       Whereas under the Taliban Government of Afghanistan, \n     individuals convicted of promoting faiths other than Islam, \n     or expressing interpretations of Islam differing from the \n     prevailing orthodoxy, could be imprisoned and those \n     converting from Islam could be tortured and publicly \n     executed;\n       Whereas the United States has more than 22,000 members of \n     the Armed Forces stationed in Afghanistan and whereas 282 \n     members of the Armed Forces have given their lives in \n     Afghanistan since Operation Enduring Freedom began in that \n     country;\n       Whereas Abdul Rahman, a citizen of Afghanistan, was \n     arrested and accused of apostasy for converting to \n     Christianity 16 years ago and threatened with execution;\n       Whereas the prosecutor in this case, Abdul Wasi, stated in \n     court that Abdul Rahman ``is known as a microbe in society, \n     and he should be cut off and removed from the rest of Muslim \n     society and should be killed.'';\n       Whereas, while it was a welcome development that charges \n     against Abdul Rahman were dropped, he was forced to seek \n     asylum in Italy;\n       Whereas, despite his release, religious freedom and those \n     who would practice it in Afghanistan remain in jeopardy;\n       Whereas religious freedom is a fundamental principle of \n     democracy;\n       Whereas the Constitution of Afghanistan does not fully \n     guarantee freedom of thought, conscience, religion, or \n     belief;\n       Whereas, on several occasions throughout Afghanistan's \n     constitution drafting process, the United States Commission \n     on International Religious Freedom raised concerns that the \n     constitution's ambiguity on issues of conversion and \n     religious expression could lead to unjust criminal \n     accusations against Muslims and non-Muslims alike;\n       Whereas charges of blasphemy since 2002 have justified \n     those concerns;\n       Whereas the International Religious Freedom Report 2005 \n     published by the Department of State does not list \n     Afghanistan among those countries cited for ``State Hostility \n     Toward Minority or Nonapproved Religions'', ``State Neglect \n     of Societal Discrimination or Abuses Against Religious \n     Groups'', or ``Discriminatory Legislation or Policies \n     Prejudicial to Certain Religions'' and notes that ``[t]he new \n     Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the \n     Government generally respected this right in practice'';\n       Whereas the International Religious Freedom Report 2005 \n     states that conversion from Islam is ``in theory - punishable \n     by death'' in Afghanistan;\n       Whereas the case of Abdul Rahman, other instances of \n     religious persecution or discrimination against minorities, \n     and ambiguities within the Constitution of Afghanistan appear \n     to warrant closer scrutiny in the International Religious \n     Freedom Report 2006; and\n       Whereas Afghanistan is a party to the International \n     Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which reads in part, \n     ``Everyone shall have the right to freedom of thought, \n     conscience and religion. This right shall include freedom to \n     have or to adopt a religion or belief of his choice, and \n     freedom, either individually or in community with others and \n     in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in \n     worship, observance, practice and teaching.'': Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) the Senate--\n       (A) recognizes freedom of religion as a central tenet of \n     democracy;\n       (B) respects the right of the people of Afghanistan to \n     self-government, while strongly urging the Government of \n     Afghanistan to respect all universally recognized human \n     rights;\n       (C) condemns the arrest of Abdul Rahman and other instances \n     of religious persecution in Afghanistan;\n\n[[Page S2806]]\n\n       (D) commends the dropping of charges against Abdul Rahman; \n     and\n       (E) strongly urges the Government of Afghanistan to \n     consider the importance of religious freedom for the broader \n     relationship between the United States and Afghanistan; and\n       (2) it is the sense of the Senate that the President and \n     the President's representatives should--\n       (A) in both public and private fora, raise concerns at the \n     highest levels with the Government of Afghanistan regarding \n     the violations of internationally recognized human rights, \n     including the right to freedom of religion or belief, in \n     Afghanistan; and\n       (B) ensure that the International Religious Freedom Report \n     2006 for Afghanistan fully addresses the issue of religious \n     persecution in that country, including the arrest of Abdul \n     Rahman.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/04/senate-section/article/S2806-1", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2806]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 422--DESIGNATING APRIL 21, 2006, AS ``NATIONAL AND \n           GLOBAL YOUTH SERVICE DAY'', AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI (for herself, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Allen, Mr. Baucus, Mr. \nBayh, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Burr, Ms. Cantwell, Mrs. Clinton, \nMr. Cochran, Mr. Coleman, Ms. Collins, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Craig, Mr. Dodd, \nMrs. Dole, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Feingold, Mrs. \nFeinstein, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Kerry, \nMs. Landrieu, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Levin, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Lott, Mr. \nMartinez, Mr. Menendez, Ms. Mikulski, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Nelson of \nFlorida, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, Mr. Salazar, Mr. Santorum, Ms. Snowe, \nMr. Specter, Ms. Stabenow, and Mr. Stevens) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

and\n       (3) educate the public, the media, and policymakers about \n     contributions made by young people as community leaders \n     throughout the year ;\n\n       Whereas National and Global Youth Service Day, a program of \n     Youth Service America, is the largest service event in the \n     world and is being observed for the 18th consecutive year in \n     2006;\n       Whereas young people in the United States and in many other \n     countries are volunteering more than any other generation in \n     history;\n       Whereas the children and youth of the United States not \n     only represent the future of the Nation, but also are leaders \n     and assets today;\n       Whereas the children and youth of the United States should \n     be valued for the idealism, energy, creativity, and unique \n     perspective that they use when addressing challenges found in \n     their communities;\n       Whereas a fundamental and conclusive correlation exists \n     between youth service, lifelong adult volunteering, and \n     philanthropy;\n       Whereas through community service, young people of all ages \n     and backgrounds build character and learn valuable skills \n     sought by employers, including time management, decision-\n     making, teamwork, needs-assessment, and leadership;\n       Whereas service-learning, an innovative teaching method \n     that combines community service with curriculum-based \n     learning, increases student achievement while strengthening \n     civic responsibility;\n       Whereas several private foundations and corporations in the \n     United States support service-learning because they \n     understand that educated, civically-engaged communities tend \n     to be economically prosperous and good places to do business;\n       Whereas sustained investments by the Federal Government, \n     business partners, schools, and communities fuel the \n     positive, long-term cultural change that will make service \n     and service-learning a common expectation and a common \n     experience for all young people;\n       Whereas National and Global Youth Service Day, with the \n     support of 51 lead agencies, hundreds of grant winners, and \n     thousands of local partners, engages millions of young people \n     worldwide;\n       Whereas National and Global Youth Service Day will involve \n     38 international organizations and 110 national partners, \n     including 8 Federal agencies and 6 organizations that offer \n     grants to support National and Global Youth Service Day;\n       Whereas National Youth Service Day has inspired Global \n     Youth Service Day, which occurs concurrently in more than 100 \n     countries and is now in its 7th year;

which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 423\n\n       Whereas Cushing's Syndrome annually affects an estimated 10 \n     to 15 people per million, most of whom are currently between \n     the ages of 20 and 50;\n       Whereas Cushing's Syndrome is an endocrine or hormonal \n     disorder caused by prolonged exposure of the body's tissue to \n     high levels of the hormone cortisol;\n       Whereas exposure to cortisol can occur by overproduction in \n     the body or by taking glucocrticoid hormones, which are \n     routinely prescribed for asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, \n     or as an immunosuppressant following transplantation;\n       Whereas the syndrome may also result from pituitary \n     adenomas, ectopic ACTH syndrome, adrenal tumors, and Familial \n     Cushing's Syndrome;\n       Whereas Cushing's Syndrome can cause abnormal weight gain, \n     skin changes, and fatigue and ultimately lead to diabetes, \n     high blood pressure, depression, osteoporosis, and death;\n       Whereas Cushing's Syndrome is diagnosed through a series of \n     tests, often requiring x-ray examinations of adrenal or \n     pituitary glands to locate tumors;\n       Whereas many people who suffer from Cushing's Syndrome are \n     misdiagnosed or go undiagnosed for years because many of the \n     symptoms are mirrored in milder diseases, thereby delaying \n     important treatment options;\n       Whereas treatments for Cushing's Syndrome include surgery, \n     radiation, chemotherapy, cortisol-inhibiting drugs, and \n     reducing the dosage of glucocorticoid hormones;\n       Whereas Cushing's Syndrome was discovered by Dr. Harvey \n     Williams Cushing, who was born on April 8th, 1869;\n       Whereas the Dr. Harvey Cushing stamp was part of the United \n     States Postal Service's ``Great American'' series, initiated \n     in 1980 to recognize individuals for making significant \n     contributions to the heritage and culture of the United \n     States;\n       Whereas President Ronald Reagan spoke on April 8, 1987, in \n     the Rose Garden at a White House ceremony to unveil the \n     commemorative stamp honoring Dr. Harvey Cushing;\n       Whereas following the ceremony, President Reagan hosted a \n     reception in the State Dining Room for Mrs. John Hay Whitney, \n     Dr. Cushing's daughter, and representatives of the American \n     Association of Neurological Surgeons; and\n       Whereas the Senate is an institution that can raise \n     awareness in the general public and the medical community of \n     Cushing's Syndrome; Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates April 8, 2006, as ``National Cushing's \n     Syndrome Awareness Day'';\n       (2) recognizes that all Americans should become more \n     informed and aware of Cushing's Syndrome;\n       (3) calls upon the people of the United States to observe \n     the date with appropriate ceremonies and activities; and\n       (4) directs the Secretary of the Senate to transmit a copy \n     of this resolution to the Cushing's Understanding, Support & \n     Help Organization.\n\n\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/04/senate-section/article/S2807-1", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2807]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S2807]]\n   SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 85--HONORING AND CONGRATULATING THE \n MINNESOTA NATIONAL GUARD, ON ITS 150TH ANNIVERSARY, FOR ITS SPIRIT OF \n  DEDICATION AND SERVICE TO THE STATE OF MINNESOTA AND THE NATION AND \n RECOGNIZING THAT THE ROLE OF THE NATIONAL GUARD, THE NATION'S CITIZEN-\nSOLDIER BASED MILITIA, WHICH WAS FORMED BEFORE THE UNITED STATES ARMY, \n HAS BEEN AND STILL IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO THE SECURITY AND FREEDOM \n                             OF THE NATION\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN (for himself and Mr. Dayton) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Armed \nServices:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 85\n\n       Whereas the Minnesota National Guard traces its origins to \n     the formation of the Pioneer Guard in the Minnesota territory \n     in 1856, 2 years before Minnesota became the 32nd State in \n     the Union;\n       Whereas the First Minnesota Infantry regiment was among the \n     first militia regiments in the Nation to respond to President \n     Lincoln's call for troops in April 1861 when it volunteered \n     for 3 years of service during the Civil War;\n       Whereas during the Civil War the First Minnesota Infantry \n     regiment saw battle at Bull Run, Antietam, and Gettysburg;\n       Whereas during a critical moment in the Battle of \n     Gettysburg on July 3, 1863, 262 soldiers of the First \n     Minnesota Infantry, along with other Union forces, bravely \n     charged and stopped Confederate troops attacking the center \n     of the Union position on Cemetery Ridge;\n       Whereas only 47 men answered the roll after this valiant \n     charge, earning the First Minnesota Infantry the highest \n     casualty rate of any unit in the Civil War;\n       Whereas the Minnesota National Guard was the first to \n     volunteer for service in the Philippines and Cuba during the \n     Spanish-American War of 1898, with enough men to form 3 \n     regiments;\n       Whereas 1 of the 3 Minnesota regiments to report for duty \n     in the War with Spain, the 13th Volunteer regiment, under the \n     command of Major General Arthur MacArthur, saw among the \n     heaviest fighting of the war in the battle of Manila and \n     suffered more casualties than all other regiments combined \n     during that key confrontation to free the Philippines;\n       Whereas after the cross-border raids of Pancho Villa and \n     the attempted instigation of a war between the United States \n     and Mexico, the border was secured in part by the Minnesota \n     National Guard;\n       Whereas the Minnesota National Guard was mobilized for duty \n     in World War I, where many Minnesotans saw duty in France, \n     including the 151st Field Artillery, which saw duty as part \n     of the famed 42nd ``Rainbow'' Division;\n       Whereas the first Air National Guard unit in the Nation was \n     the 109th Observation Squadron of the Minnesota National \n     Guard, which passed its muster inspection on January 17, \n     1921;\n       Whereas a tank company of the Minnesota National Guard from \n     Brainerd, Minnesota, was shipped to the Philippines in 1941 \n     to shore up American defenses against Japan as World War II \n     neared;\n       Whereas these men from Brainerd fought hard and bravely as \n     American forces were pushed into the Bataan Peninsula and \n     ultimately endured the Bataan Death March;\n       Whereas men of the Minnesota National Guard's 175th Field \n     Artillery, as part of the 34th ``Red Bull'' Division, became \n     the first American Division to be deployed to Europe in \n     January of 1942;\n       Whereas when the 34th Division was shipped to North Africa, \n     it fired the first American shells against the Nazi forces;\n       Whereas the 34th Division participated in 6 major Army \n     campaigns in North Africa, Sicily, and Italy, which led to \n     the division being credited with taking the most enemy-\n     defended hills of any division in the European Theater as \n     well as having more combat days than any other division in \n     Europe;\n       Whereas the Minnesota National Guard served with \n     distinction on the ground and in the air during Operations \n     Desert Shield and Desert Storm;\n       Whereas Minnesota National Guard troops have helped keep \n     the peace in the former Yugoslavia, including 1,100 troops \n     who have seen service in Bosnia, Croatia, and Kosovo;\n       Whereas the Minnesota National Guard has participated in \n     keeping America safe after September 11, 2001, in numerous \n     ways, including airport security;\n       Whereas the Duluth-based 148th Fighter Wing's F-16s flew \n     patrols over cities after September 11, 2001, for a longer \n     time than any other air defense unit;\n       Whereas over 11,000 members of the Minnesota National Guard \n     have been called up for full-time service since the September \n     11, 2001, terrorist attacks;\n       Whereas as of March 20, 2006, Minnesota National Guard \n     troops are serving in national defense missions in \n     Afghanistan, Pakistan, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, and Iraq;\n       Whereas more than 600 Minnesota National Guard troops have \n     been deployed to Afghanistan in Operation Enduring Freedom;\n       Whereas members of the Minnesota National Guard, serving in \n     the 1st Brigade Combat Team of the 34th Infantry Division, \n     have been a part of the State's largest troop deployment \n     since World War II, with more than 2,600 citizen soldiers \n     called to service in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom;\n       Whereas the Minnesota National Guard has greatly \n     contributed not only to battles but to the suppressing of \n     violent riots, such as the 1947 national meat processors \n     strike, in which they aided helpless police officers, and the \n     fight against natural disasters such as the Red River flood \n     in 1997 in which they organized search and rescue missions, \n     helped shelter people who were left homeless, ran logistics, \n     and helped sandbagging efforts; and\n       Whereas on April 17, 2006, the Minnesota National Guard \n     will celebrate its 150th anniversary along with its \n     historical and recent accomplishments: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) honors and congratulates the Minnesota National Guard \n     for its spirit of dedication and service to the State of \n     Minnesota and to the Nation on its 150th anniversary; and\n       (2) recognizes that the role of the National Guard, the \n     Nation's citizen-soldier based militia, which was formed \n     before the United States Army, has been and still is \n     extremely important to the security and freedom of the \n     Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url":

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The failure of Federal, State, and local governments to \n     control and sanction the unauthorized employment and unlawful \n     exploitation of illegal alien workers is a primary cause of \n     illegal immigration.\n       (2) The use of modern technology not available in 1986, \n     when the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (Public \n     Law 99-603; 100 Stat. 3359) created the I-9 worker \n     verification system, will enable employers to rapidly and \n     accurately verify the identity and work authorization of \n     their employees and independent contractors.\n       (3) The Government and people of the United States share a \n     compelling interest in protection of United States employment \n     authorization, income tax withholding, and social security \n     accounting systems, against unauthorized access by illegal \n     aliens.\n       (4) Limited data sharing between the Department of Homeland \n     Security, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Social \n     Security Administration is essential to the integrity of \n     these vital programs, which protect the employment and \n     retirement security of all working Americans.\n       (5) The Federal judiciary must be open to private United \n     States citizens, legal foreign workers, and law-abiding \n     enterprises that seek judicial protection against injury to \n     their wages and working conditions due to unlawful employment \n     of illegal alien workers and the United States enterprises \n     that utilize the labor or services provided by illegal \n     aliens, especially where lack of resources constrains \n     enforcement of Federal immigration law by Federal immigration \n     officials.\n\n         Subtitle B--Employment Eligibility Verification System\n\n     SEC. 411. EMPLOYMENT ELIGIBILITY VERIFICATION SYSTEM.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 274A(b) of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1324a(b)) is amended by adding at \n     the end the following:\n       ``(7) Employment eligibility verification system.--\n       ``(A) In general.--The Secretary of Homeland Security shall \n     establish and administer a verification system, known as the \n     Employment Eligibility Verification System, through which the \n     Secretary--\n       ``(i) responds to inquiries made by persons at any time \n     through a toll-free telephone line and other toll-free \n     electronic media concerning an individual's identity and \n     whether the individual is authorized to be employed; and\n       ``(ii) maintains records of the inquiries that were made, \n     of verifications provided (or not provided), and of the codes \n     provided to inquirers as evidence of their compliance with \n     their obligations under this section.\n       ``(B) Initial response.--The verification system shall \n     provide verification or a tentative nonverification of an \n     individual's identity and employment eligibility within 3 \n     working days of the initial inquiry.

I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of S. Res. 421, which was submitted earlier \ntoday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 421) calling on the government of \n     Afghanistan to uphold freedom of religion and urging the \n     Government of the United States to promote religious freedom \n     in Afghanistan.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in the past week, the world has witnessed \nthe arrest, the imprisonment, the threatened execution, and eventually \nthe release of a man in Afghanistan named Abdul Rahman. His so-called \ncrime? Apostasy. He was threatened with capital punishment because 16 \nyears ago, while working on a humanitarian mission in Pakistan, he \nconverted to Christianity.\n  Abdul Rahman has thankfully been released, and charges against him \nhave been dropped. However, religious freedom remains in jeopardy in \nAfghanistan as do those who might choose to practice it.\n  I have great respect for President Karzai and the state he is trying \nto build. I respect the right of Afghanistan to its own laws and legal \nsystem.\n  But it will be a great tragedy if the overthrow of the Taliban \ngovernment results in its replacement by a state that professes \ndemocracy but falls so far short of such an essential democratic \nstandard: the freedom of belief.\n  We have over 22,000 troops in Afghanistan. Two hundred and eighty-two \nAmericans have given their lives in that country since Operation \nEnduring Freedom began.\n  Freedom must, by definition, include freedom of religion,\n  It is our responsibility to make that utterly clear. As President \nBush has stated, ``We expect [the government of Afghanistan] to honor \nthe universal principle of freedom. It is deeply troubling that a \ncountry we helped liberate would hold a person to account because they \nchose a particular religion over another.''\n  The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom \nraised concerns during the drafting of Afghanistan's constitution that \nit opened the door for cases such as this. Those concerns extend to \nboth members of religious minorities and to members of the country's \nmajority Muslim community who might dare to express an interpretation \nof Islam that differs from the prevailing orthodoxy. Sadly, these \napprehensions have been borne out.\n  The State Department's International Religious Freedom Report for \n2005 noted that conversion from Islam is ``in theory'' punishable by \ndeath in Afghanistan. Although charges against Mr. Rahman were \nfortunately dropped, clearly such a punishment is more than simply \ntheoretical.\n  Afghanistan is a party to the International Covenant on Civil and \nPolitical Rights, which reads in part, ``Everyone shall have the right \nto freedom of thought, conscience and religion. This right shall \ninclude freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief of his choice, \nand freedom, either individually or in community with others and in \npublic or private, to manifest his religion or belief in worship, \nobservance, practice and teaching.''\n  Today, I am introducing a resolution calling on the Government of \nAfghanistan to live up to the principles it has endorsed in that \ncovenant. This resolution also urges the Government of Afghanistan to \nconsider the importance\n\n[[Page S2843]]\n\nof religious freedom for the broader relationship between our two \ncountries, and it expresses the sense of Congress that the President \nand his representatives should raise these human rights issues both \npublicly and privately.\n  In 1864, Abraham Lincoln wrote a grieving mother who had lost 5 sons \nin a single day in battle. He sought to offer her consolation for ``so \ncostly a sacrifice upon the altar of freedom.'' Two hundred and eighty-\ntwo Americans have made that sacrifice in Afghanistan. Countless \nAfghans died in the struggle against Soviet invaders and others in \nresistance against the brutal regime of the Taliban. It is my fervent \nhope that Afghanistan lives up to the promise of its own pledge to \nuphold human rights: freedom of worship must be part of any true \nenduring freedom.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements relating \nthereto be printed in the Record as if read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 421) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 421\n\n       Whereas under the Taliban Government of Afghanistan, \n     individuals convicted of promoting faiths other than Islam, \n     or expressing interpretations of Islam differing from the \n     prevailing orthodoxy, could be imprisoned and those \n     converting from Islam could be tortured and publicly \n     executed;\n       Whereas the United States has more than 22,000 members of \n     the Armed Forces stationed in Afghanistan and whereas 282 \n     members of the Armed Forces have given their lives in \n     Afghanistan since Operation Enduring Freedom began in that \n     country;\n       Whereas Abdul Rahman, a citizen of Afghanistan, was \n     arrested and accused of apostasy for converting to \n     Christianity 16 years ago and threatened with execution;\n       Whereas the prosecutor in this case, Abdul Wasi, stated in \n     court that Abdul Rahman ``is known as a microbe in society, \n     and he should be cut off and removed from the rest of Muslim \n     society and should be killed.'';\n       Whereas, while it was a welcome development that charges \n     against Abdul Rahman were dropped, he was forced to seek \n     asylum in Italy;\n       Whereas, despite his release, religious freedom and those \n     who would practice it in Afghanistan remain in jeopardy;\n       Whereas religious freedom is a fundamental principle of \n     democracy;\n       Whereas the Constitution of Afghanistan does not fully \n     guarantee freedom of thought, conscience, religion, or \n     belief;\n       Whereas, on several occasions throughout Afghanistan's \n     constitution drafting process, the United States Commission \n     on International Religious Freedom raised concerns that the \n     constitution's ambiguity on issues of conversion and \n     religious expression could lead to unjust criminal \n     accusations against Muslims and non-Muslims alike;\n       Whereas charges of blasphemy since 2002 have justified \n     those concerns;\n       Whereas the International Religious Freedom Report 2005 \n     published by the Department of State does not list \n     Afghanistan among those countries cited for ``State Hostility \n     Toward Minority or Nonapproved Religions'', ``State Neglect \n     of Societal Discrimination or Abuses Against Religious \n     Groups'', or ``Discriminatory Legislation or Policies \n     Prejudicial to Certain Religions'' and notes that ``[t]he new \n     Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the \n     Government generally respected this right in practice'';\n       Whereas the International Religious Freedom Report 2005 \n     states that conversion from Islam is ``in theory - punishable \n     by death'' in Afghanistan;\n       Whereas the case of Abdul Rahman, other instances of \n     religious persecution or discrimination against minorities, \n     and ambiguities within the Constitution of Afghanistan appear \n     to warrant closer scrutiny in the International Religious \n     Freedom Report 2006; and\n       Whereas Afghanistan is a party to the International \n     Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which reads in part, \n     ``Everyone shall have the right to freedom of thought, \n     conscience and religion. This right shall include freedom to \n     have or to adopt a religion or belief of his choice, and \n     freedom, either individually or in community with others and \n     in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in \n     worship, observance, practice and teaching.'': Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) the Senate--\n       (A) recognizes freedom of religion as a central tenet of \n     democracy;\n       (B) respects the right of the people of Afghanistan to \n     self-government, while strongly urging the Government of \n     Afghanistan to respect all universally recognized human \n     rights;\n       (C) condemns the arrest of Abdul Rahman and other instances \n     of religious persecution in Afghanistan;\n       (D) commends the dropping of charges against Abdul Rahman; \n     and\n       (E) strongly urges the Government of Afghanistan to \n     consider the importance of religious freedom for the broader \n     relationship between the United States and Afghanistan; and\n       (2) it is the sense of the Senate that the President and \n     the President's representatives should--\n       (A) in both public and private fora, raise concerns at the \n     highest levels with the Government of Afghanistan regarding \n     the violations of internationally recognized human rights, \n     including the right to freedom of religion or belief, in \n     Afghanistan; and\n       (B) ensure that the International Religious Freedom Report \n     2006 for Afghanistan fully addresses the issue of religious \n     persecution in that country, including the arrest of Abdul \n     Rahman.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/04/senate-section/article/S2843-1", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2843-S2844]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 NATIONAL AND GLOBAL YOUTH SERVICE DAY\n\n  Mr. BENNETT.

Res. 422) designating April 21, 2006, as \n     National and Global Youth Service Day, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to support a resolution \ndesignating April 21, 2006, as National and Global Youth Service Day. \nThis resolution recognizes and commends the significant community \nservice efforts that youth are making in communities across the country \nand around the world on April 21 and every day. This resolution also \nencourages the citizens of the United States to acknowledge and support \nthese volunteer efforts.\n  National and Global Youth Service Day is an annual public awareness \nand education campaign that highlights the valuable contributions that \nyoung people make to their communities throughout the year. On this \nday, youth from across the United States and the world will carry out \ncommunity service projects in areas ranging from hunger to literacy to \nthe environment. Through this service, many will embark on a lifelong \npath of service and civic engagement in more than 100 countries around \nthe world.\n  In Alaska, the following groups will engage youth in community \nservice activities in observance of National and Global Youth Service \nDay:\n\n       One, Anchorage's Promise, which works to mobilize all \n     sectors of the community to build the character and \n     competence of Anchorage's children and youth by fulfilling \n     Five Promises: Caring Adults, Safe Places, Healthy Start, \n     Equitable Education for Marketable Skills, and Opportunities \n     to Serve, is sponsoring the annual Kids' Day event. Over 20 \n     interactive exhibits will be staffed by youth, including \n     booths where young people can see how easily an egg cracks \n     without wearing a seatbelt, discover why bike helmets are \n     important, and see just how clean their hands really are.\n       Two, eighth graders from the Neon Team at Goldenview Middle \n     School in Anchorage are creating colorful cards with spring-\n     themed haiku poems. At least 120 students will donate cards \n     to social service agencies, hospitals, and community support \n     organizations throughout Anchorage. The purpose of this \n     project is to spread Springtime cheer to those in the \n     Anchorage community who may not otherwise experience a joyful \n     Spring.\n       Three, members of Alaska Youth for Environmental Action, a \n     statewide youth organization associated with the National \n     Wildlife Federation, are developing a project to inform and \n     involve youth in the use of energy efficient light bulbs. \n     Young people throughout the State will petition their local \n     communities for support and will encourage the use of energy \n     efficient light bulbs.\n\n  Many similar and wonderful activities will be taking place all across \nthe Nation.\n  I thank my colleagues--Senators Akaka, Allen, Baucus, Bayh, Boxer, \nBunning, Burr, Cantwell, Clinton, Cochran, Coleman, Collins, Cornyn, \nCraig, Dodd, Dole, Domenici, Dorgan, Durbin, Feingold, Feinstein, \nHagel, Isakson, Johnson, Kennedy, Kerry, Landrieu, Lautenberg, Levin, \nLieberman, Lott, Martinez, Menendez, Mikulski, Murray, Nelson of \nFlorida, Nelson of Nebraska, Salazar, Santorum, Snowe, Specter, \nStabenow, and Stevens--for standing with me as original cosponsors of \nthis worthwhile legislation, which will ensure that youth across the \ncountry and the world know that all of their hard work is greatly \nappreciated.\n\n[[Page S2844]]\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S.

Res. 422\n\n       Whereas National and Global Youth Service Day is an annual \n     public awareness and education campaign that highlights the \n     valuable contributions that young people make to their \n     communities throughout the year;\n       Whereas the goals of National and Global Youth Service Day \n     are to--\n       (1) mobilize the youth of the United States to identify and \n     address the needs of their communities through service and \n     service-learning;\n       (2) encourage young citizens to embark on a lifelong path \n     of service and civic engagement; and\n       (3) educate the public, the media, and policymakers about \n     contributions made by young people as community leaders \n     throughout the year;\n       Whereas National and Global Youth Service Day, a program of \n     Youth Service America, is the largest service event in the \n     world and is being observed for the 18th consecutive year in \n     2006;\n       Whereas young people in the United States and in many other \n     countries are volunteering more than any other generation in \n     history;\n       Whereas the children and youth of the United States not \n     only represent the future of the Nation, but also are leaders \n     and assets today;\n       Whereas the children and youth of the United States should \n     be valued for the idealism, energy, creativity, and unique \n     perspective that they use when addressing challenges found in \n     their communities;\n       Whereas a fundamental and conclusive correlation exists \n     between youth service, lifelong adult volunteering, and \n     philanthropy;\n       Whereas through community service, young people of all ages \n     and backgrounds build character and learn valuable skills \n     sought by employers, including time management, decision-\n     making, teamwork, needs-assessment, and leadership;\n       Whereas service-learning, an innovative teaching method \n     that combines community service with curriculum-based \n     learning, increases student achievement while strengthening \n     civic responsibility;\n       Whereas several private foundations and corporations in the \n     United States support service-learning because they \n     understand that educated, civically-engaged communities tend \n     to be economically prosperous and good places to do business;\n       Whereas sustained investments by the Federal Government, \n     business partners, schools, and communities fuel the \n     positive, long-term cultural change that will make service \n     and service-learning a common expectation and a common \n     experience for all young people;\n       Whereas National and Global Youth Service Day, with the \n     support of 51 lead agencies, hundreds of grant winners, and \n     thousands of local partners, engages millions of young people \n     worldwide;\n       Whereas National and Global Youth Service Day will involve \n     38 international organizations and 110 national partners, \n     including 8 Federal agencies and 6 organizations that offer \n     grants to support National and Global Youth Service Day;\n       Whereas National Youth Service Day has inspired Global \n     Youth Service Day, which occurs concurrently in more than 100 \n     countries and is now in its 7th year; and\n       Whereas both young people and their communities will \n     benefit greatly from expanded opportunities to engage the \n     youth of the United States in meaningful volunteer service \n     and service-learning: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes and commends the significant contributions \n     of United States youth and encourages the cultivation of a \n     common civic bond between young people dedicated to serving \n     their neighbors, their communities, and the Nation;\n       (2) designates April 21, 2006, as ``National and Global \n     Youth Service Day''; and\n       (3) calls on the citizens of the United States to--\n       (A) observe the day by encouraging and engaging youth to \n     participate in civic and community service projects;\n       (B) recognize the volunteer efforts of the young people of \n     the United States throughout the year; and\n       (C) support the volunteer efforts of young people and \n     engage them in meaningful decision-making opportunities today \n     as an investment for the future of the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/04/senate-section/article/S2844-1", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2844-S2845]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               NATIONAL CUSHING'S SYNDROME AWARENESS DAY\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to consideration of S. Res. 423, which was submitted \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 423) designating April 8, 2006 as \n     National Cushing's Syndrome Awareness Day.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise today along with my colleague, Tom \nCoburn, to proudly support a resolution designating April 8, 2006, as \nNational Cushing's Syndrome Awareness Day. I have long been dedicated \nto quality health care and therefore seek to raise awareness of this \ndebilitating disorder that affects an estimated 10 to 15 people per \nmillion.\n  My desire to see my Oklahoma constituents and all Americans receive \nthe best possible health care is evidenced by my involvement in various \nhealth related issues. I have always been a champion of rural health \ncare providers. In 1997, I was one of the few Republicans to vote \nagainst the Balanced Budget Act because of its lack of support for \nrural hospitals. At that time, I made a commitment to not allow our \nrural hospitals to be closed and am pleased we finally addressed that \nimportant issue in the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 by providing \ngreat benefits for rural health care providers as well as a voluntary \nprescription drug benefit to seniors. In 2003, I also cosponsored the \nHealth Care Access and Rural Equity Act, to protect and preserve access \nof Medicare beneficiaries to health care in rural regions.\n  I am a strong advocate of medical liability reform and am an original \ncosponsor of S. 11, the Patients First Act, to protect patients' access \nto quality and affordable health care by reducing the effects of \nexcessive liability costs. There are solutions to alleviate the burden \nplaced on physicians and patients by excessive medical malpractice \nlawsuits, and I am committed to this vital reform.\n  I have also worked with officials from the Center for Medicare and \nMedicaid Services to expand access to lifesaving implantable cardiac \ndefibrillators. I supported legislation to increase the supply of \npancreatic islet cells for research and co-sponsored a bill to take the \nabortion pill RU-486 off the market in the United States.\n  I also introduced S. 96, the Flu Vaccine Incentive Act, to help \nprevent any future shortages in flu vaccines. My bill removes \nsuffocating price controls from government purchasing of the flu \nvaccine while encouraging more companies to enter the market. Also, my \nbill frees American companies to enter the flu vaccine industry by \ngiving them an investment tax credit towards the construction of flu \nvaccine production facilities.\n  Additionally, I have consistently co-sponsored yearly resolutions \ndesignating a day in October as National Mammography Day and a week in \nAugust as National Health Center Week to raise awareness regarding both \nthese issues.\n  As the Federal Government invests in improving hospitals and \nhealthcare initiatives, I have fought hard to ensure that Oklahoma gets \nits fair share. Specifically, over the past 3 years, I have helped to \nsecure $5.2 million in funding for the Oklahoma Medical Research \nFoundation, the Oklahoma State Department of Health planning initiative \nfor a rural telemedicine system, the INTEGRIS Healthcare System, the \nUniversity of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, the Oklahoma Center for \nthe Advancement of Science and Technology, St. Anthony's Heart \nHospital, the Hillcrest Healthcare System, and the Morton Health \nCenter.\n\n  I rise before the Senate to seek your help in raising awareness of \nCushing's Syndrome, which is an endocrine or hormonal disorder caused \nby prolonged exposure of the body's tissue to high levels of the \nhormone cortisol. Though it can lead to death, Cushing's Syndrome often \ngoes undiagnosed or misdiagnosed because the initial symptoms are \nshared with a number of milder ailments. These symptoms include, but \nare not limited to, abnormal weight gain, skin changes, fatigue, \ndiabetes, high blood pressure, depression and osteoporosis.\n  Cushing's Syndrome can take a variety of forms. Normally, the \nhypothalamus, a part of the brain which is about the size of a small \nsugar cube, stimulates the pituitary gland, the adrenal glands, and \nthen the kidneys which release cortisol into the bloodstream. High \nlevels of cortisol can result from overproducing cortisol\n\n[[Page S2845]]\n\nor from taking glucocorticoid hormones, which are routinely prescribed \nfor asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and other inflammatory \ndiseases.\n  Doctors can detect Cushing's Syndrome through a series of tests, \noften using x rays to examine adrenal or pituitary glands to locate \ntumors. However, since awareness of the syndrome is low, doctors do not \nalways run these tests, and patients do not know to ask for them. \nTherefore, treatment often comes later than it should for victims of \nCushing's Syndrome. Potential treatments for Cushing's Syndrome include \nsurgery, radiation, chemotherapy, cortisol-inhibiting drugs, or \nreducing the dosage of glucocorticoid hormones.\n  The need for heightened awareness of Cushing's Syndrome was brought \nto my attention by constituents who suffer from this dangerous disease. \nFor the sake of these individuals and for the benefit of sufferers in \nyour own State and around the Nation, I ask my colleagues to join me in \nthis effort to raise awareness of Cushing's Syndrome.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 423) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 423\n\n       Whereas Cushing's Syndrome annually affects an estimated 10 \n     to 15 people per million, most of whom are currently between \n     the ages of 20 and 50;\n       Whereas Cushing's Syndrome is an endocrine or hormonal \n     disorder caused by prolonged exposure of the body's tissue to \n     high levels of the hormone cortisol;\n       Whereas exposure to cortisol can occur by overproduction in \n     the body or by taking glucocorticoid hormones, which are \n     routinely prescribed for asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, \n     or as an immunosuppressant following transplantation;\n       Whereas the syndrome may also result from pituitary \n     adenomas, ectopic ACTH syndrome, adrenal tumors, and Familial \n     Cushing's Syndrome;\n       Whereas Cushing's Syndrome can cause abnormal weight gain, \n     skin changes, and fatigue and ultimately lead to diabetes, \n     high blood pressure, depression, osteoporosis, and death;\n       Whereas Cushing's Syndrome is diagnosed through a series of \n     tests, often requiring x-ray examinations of adrenal or \n     pituitary glands to locate tumors;\n       Whereas many people who suffer from Cushing's Syndrome are \n     misdiagnosed or go undiagnosed for years because many of the \n     symptoms are mirrored in milder diseases, thereby delaying \n     important treatment options;\n       Whereas treatments for Cushing's Syndrome include surgery, \n     radiation, chemotherapy, cortisol-inhibiting drugs, and \n     reducing the dosage of glucocorticoid hormones;\n       Whereas Cushing's Syndrome was discovered by Dr. Harvey \n     Williams Cushing, who was born on April 8th, 1869;\n       Whereas the Dr. Harvey Cushing stamp was part of the United \n     States Postal Service's ``Great American'' series, initiated \n     in 1980 to recognize individuals for making significant \n     contributions to the heritage and culture of the United \n     States;\n       Whereas President Ronald Reagan spoke on April 8, 1987, in \n     the Rose Garden at a White House ceremony to unveil the \n     commemorative stamp honoring Dr. Harvey Cushing;\n       Whereas following the ceremony, President Reagan hosted a \n     reception in the State Dining Room for Mrs. John Hay Whitney, \n     Dr. Cushing's daughter, and representatives of the American \n     Association of Neurological Surgeons; and\n       Whereas the Senate is an institution that can raise \n     awareness in the general public and the medical community of \n     Cushing's Syndrome; Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates April 8, 2006, as ``National Cushing's \n     Syndrome Awareness Day'';\n       (2) recognizes that all Americans should become more \n     informed and aware of Cushing's Syndrome;\n       (3) calls upon the people of the United States to observe \n     the date with appropriate ceremonies and activities; and\n       (4) directs the Secretary of the Senate to transmit a copy \n     of this resolution to the Cushing's Understanding, Support & \n     Help Organization.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/04/senate-section/article/S2845-1", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2845]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      REMOVAL OF INJUNCTION OF SECRECY--TREATY DOCUMENT NO. 109-9\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, as in executive session, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the injunction of secrecy be removed from the following \ntreaty, transmitted to the Senate on April 4, 2006, by the President of \nthe United States:\n  Investment Treaty with Uruguay (Treaty Document No. 109-9).\n  I further ask unanimous consent that the treaty be considered as \nhaving been read the first time, that it be referred with accompanying \npapers to the Committee on Foreign Relations in order to be printed, \nand that the President's message be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The message of the President is as follows:\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to \nratification, I transmit herewith the Treaty between the United States \nand the Oriental Republic of Uruguay Concerning the Encouragement and \nReciprocal Protection of Investment, with Annexes and Protocol, signed \nat Mar del Plata, Argentina, on November 4, 2005. I transmit also, for \nthe information of the Senate, the report prepared by the Department of \nState with respect to the Treaty.\n  The Treaty is the first bilateral investment treaty (BIT) concluded \nsince 1999 and the first negotiated on the basis of a new U.S. model \nBIT text, which was completed in 2004. The new model text draws on \nlong-standing U.S. BIT principles, our experience with Chapter 11 of \nthe North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and the executive \nbranch's collaboration with the Congress in developing negotiating \nobjectives on foreign investment for U.S. free trade agreements. The \nTreaty will establish investment protections that will create more \nfavorable conditions for U.S. investment in Uruguay and assist Uruguay \nin its efforts to further develop its economy.\n  The Treaty is fully consistent with U.S. policy towards international \nand domestic investment. A specific tenet of U.S. investment policy, \nreflected in this Treaty, is that U.S. investment abroad and foreign \ninvestment in the United States should receive national treatment and \nmost-favored-nation treatment. Under this Treaty, the Parties also \nagree to customary international law standards for expropriation and \nfor the minimum standard of treatment. The Treaty includes detailed \nprovisions regarding the computation and payment of prompt, adequate, \nand effective compensation for expropriation; free transfer of funds \nrelated to investment; freedom of investment from specified performance \nrequirements; and the opportunity of investors to choose to resolve \ndisputes with a host government through international arbitration. The \nTreaty also includes extensive transparency obligations with respect to \nnational laws and regulations, and commitments to transparency and \npublic participation in dispute settlement. The Parties also recognize \nthat it is inappropriate to encourage investment by weakening or \nreducing the protections afforded in domestic environmental and labor \nlaws.\n  I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to \nthe Treaty and give its advice and consent to ratification.\n                                                      George W.
