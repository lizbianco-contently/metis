Mr. President, we have a period of 1 hour of morning \nbusiness to start today's session. Following morning business, we have \n1 hour of debate prior to a scheduled cloture vote on the pending \namendment relating to military tribunals, to the military commissions. \nBefore that cloture vote begins, the Democratic leader and I will \ncontinue to work toward an agreement that would allow us to consider \nthe military tribunal legislation as a freestanding measure under a \nspecific time agreement. We started talking about that yesterday and \nworked through the night, and we will continue over the course of the \nmorning to reach that agreement. We are working in good faith toward an \nunderstanding on this bill and hope we will be able to work that out \nprior to that 11:30 a.m. vote. I will keep our colleagues posted as to \nthe outcome of those talks.\n  If we are able to reach a consent agreement, then I will vitiate the \norder for the cloture vote, and we will proceed directly to the \nmilitary tribunals, the so-called Hamdan legislation, today. Votes will \nlikely occur throughout the afternoon either on the cloture vote on \nthat issue or on amendments that may be considered to the freestanding \nbill.\n  We have a number of other important items to consider this week. The \nDefense appropriations conference report has been filed, and we do not \nexpect that to take very much time at all. It may even be that we can \ndo that at some point later today.\n  We have the Homeland Security appropriations that will shortly be \ncompleted, as well as other conference reports that are underway, such \nas port security, which may become available.\n  I remind my colleagues that we have a policy meeting on this side of \nthe aisle to occur from 12:30 p.m. to 2:15 p.m. today. If we can \nschedule debate on one of these issues during that time, we will likely \nbe able to remain in session in order to make progress.\n  I have a brief statement. Does the Democratic leader have comments?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/27/senate-section/article/S10223-8", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10223]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I appreciate the majority leader yielding. \nSo everyone understands where we are, let me repeat what the majority \nleader said. As things now stand, we are going to have a cloture vote \non the Hamdan matter, the Supreme Court detainee situation that now \nconfronts the country, sometime this evening.\n  What we are going to try to do in the next hour or so is work out a \nunanimous consent agreement that there will be amendments allowed to be \noffered on the Hamdan matter. There would be amendments. We would agree \nbetween the leader and me as to how much time will be on the \namendments.\n  I have cleared this matter with most everyone. As I told the leader \ntoday, I still have to work things out with two other members of the \nJudiciary Committee. Hopefully, I can do that. If not, what will happen \nis cloture will be invoked on Hamdan and then 30 hours will start, and \nthere will be cloture on the fence bill, the barrier bill, sometime \ntomorrow. We are trying to work our way through this so the Hamdan \nmatter will have some debate on it and some amendments offered on it. \nWe are doing our best to do that.\n  As I said yesterday, late in a session such as this, everyone becomes \na\n\n[[Page S10224]]\n\nCharles Atlas--one person can stop anything. They have the right to do \nthat. We understand that. But procedurally that is where we are now. \nHopefully, we can work our way through this and have some debate on \nthis detainee matter and move on to the fence bill, hopefully work \nsomething out on that, and put us on a glidepath to completing the work \nof the body, as the majority wants to do, in the next couple of days.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield on that point for a \ncouple of moments?\n  Mr. REID. Of course.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I commend the two leaders for trying to \nwork out these issues. Over the years, I have seen leaders try to do it \nat the end of a session. I don't consider myself a Charles Atlas, but I \ndo consider myself a U.S. Senator. I have taken an oath to uphold the \nConstitution of the United States.\n  Some of us have sat in this Chamber and in committee for 5 years \nwhile what was being done in detaining the prisoners violated our \nConstitution and our traditions in the United States. Seven of the nine \nMembers of the Supreme Court are Republicans, incidentally, and have \nsaid the same thing in the Hamdan decision.\n  We tried for 5 years to get the administration to listen to us, to \ntell us there are ways we could have worked this out so the United \nStates would follow its own laws, would follow its own Constitution, \nwould follow the ideals on which this country was founded, and give \nthat kind of example, a shining light to the rest of the world. And now \nsuddenly the administration, after meeting behind closed doors, \npredominantly just with the Republicans, says: Here, in 2 hours' time, \nwe have a solution; accept it. I have some problems with that. I will \ndiscuss this with the leaders.\n  As I said, I don't stand here as Charles Atlas, but I stand here as a \nU.S. Senator with my rights and to protect the rights of Americans.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reclaiming the floor for just a moment, I \nsay to my friend from Vermont, I consider him a Charles Atlas today and \nany time I have ever served with him in the Senate. He is one of the \nmost senior Members in the Senate. He is the person the Democrats have \ndesignated to be the arbiter of issues that go on in the Judiciary \nCommittee, the busiest committee in the Senate.\n  I also say to my friend that he is not only a U.S. Senator but a very \ngood one, and I look forward to working with him to work through this \nissue, and with other members of the committee, as I mentioned, not in \nname, but there are others I need to work with on the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we will continue our discussions. The goal \nwill be to make sure Senators do have the opportunity to debate and \namend this bill. We are just trying to put together an agreement to do \nthat. If not, we will have the cloture vote and still have that debate \nand that opportunity as we go forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/27/senate-section/article/S10224-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10224]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            NATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS INVESTMENT ACT OF 2006\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I wish to comment briefly on another issue, \nthe National Competitiveness Investment Act of 2006, a bill that was \nintroduced yesterday with bipartisan sponsorship--myself and Senator \nReid--a bill that focuses on our global competitiveness by focusing on \neducation, by focusing on the resources we should be investing right \nhere at home to make sure we are globally competitive with nations such \nas China and India. If we don't act, our Nation is going to lose our \ncompetitive edge.\n  The United States today has the strongest scientific and \ntechnological enterprise in the world, including the best universities \nand the best corporations investing in research. But there is growing \nevidence and recognition that our educational system is failing to \nequip our young people and older people today to compete in this \nincreasingly global economy. We are failing in the very areas that have \nin the past underpinned our strength, in areas such as mathematics, \nscience, and engineering.\n  We are going to have to invest in the future in those specific areas \nif we are going to preserve our competitive edge, what has made this \ncountry great, as we have competed with other nations around the world. \nWe are in a 21st century global economy which depends on mathematics, \nscience, and technology. Those are the foundations. They are the engine \nto create that economic security for the next generation.\n  Two years ago, the Senate Energy Committee asked the National \nAcademies to identify policies that would enable the United States to \nsuccessfully compete and prosper. The National Competitiveness \nInvestment Act of 2006, a bipartisan bill we introduced yesterday, \nincorporates the recommendations made by the National Academies and a \nnumber of other very similar studies that have been produced over the \nlast 2 to 3 years.\n  The bill reflects the bipartisan leadership of many Senators, \nincluding those of the three major Senate committees responsible--\nEnergy, Commerce, and the HELP Committee.\n  In these few moments, I wish to comment on what this bill does \nbecause it is important for people to understand how we invest and \nwhere we invest to improve that global competitiveness in this 21st \ncentury economy.\n  The bill doubles our investment for basic Federal research over the \nnext 5 years at the National Science Foundation and increases \ninvestment for basic research at NASA and other science-related \nagencies.\n  It creates a new teachers institute to improve teaching techniques--\nhow we teach math and science--focusing on education, on teachers who \nare responsible for putting forth that knowledge.\n  It creates a DARPA-modeled advanced research projects agency at the \nDepartment of Energy dedicated to the goal of increasing innovation and \ncompetitiveness breakthroughs in technology.\n  It expands scholarship programs that are aimed to recruit and train \nmath and science teachers--teachers who really need to focus on the K-\n12 area.\n  It encourages more students, more high school students, to take \nadvanced placement courses and enter the international baccalaureate \nprograms.\n  It will take an increased investment. Over the next 5 years, our \neconomy will exceed $76 trillion--$76 trillion is how big our economy \nwill grow. A 1-percent investment for the future is really a small \nprice to pay for that continued security and leadership in the world.\n  I did not have the opportunity to speak to this bill yesterday when \nit was introduced. I encourage our colleagues to join the bipartisan \nleadership--again, myself and Senator Reid who are sponsors of this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/27/senate-section/article/S10224-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10224-S10232]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RETIRING FROM THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, even a diehard Red Sox fan has to give \nthe devil his due. Probably the most moving moment in the history of \nbaseball was when longtime New York Yankees first baseman Lou Gehrig \nwalked on the field to accept the tribute of his fans and teammates. On \nIndependence Day in 1939, he told the crowd at Yankee Stadium that he \nconsidered himself the luckiest man on the face of the Earth.\n\n  I consider myself pretty lucky, too. I was elected to the House of \nRepresentatives in 1974. That was not the best year to be a Republican \ncandidate. Out of an enormous freshman class of 92 new Members, which \nincluded Chris Dodd and Tom Harkin, only 17 of us were Republicans. And \nas Chuck Grassley and I walked down the aisle of the House, he with \ncrutches and I with a neck brace, one Democrat muttered: There's two we \nalmost got.\n  Time has gotten just about all of us. With my retirement and that of \nHenry Hyde in the House, Chuck Grassley next year will become the last \nremaining Member of the Republican class of\n\n[[Page S10225]]\n\n1974, an iron horse in his own right. The silver lining for me in the \nelectoral losses suffered by the Republicans was a chance to land \nsenior positions on the Agriculture and Education Subcommittees that \nwould quickly throw me into the thick of things. Throughout my career \nin the House, I focused on those two issues.\n  In 1988, with the retirement of Bob Stafford, I ran for and won a \nseat in the Senate. Senator Stafford was a tough act to follow. He had \nheld just about every office in the State of Vermont and had an \nenormous impact on the Federal policy for education, the environment, \nand elsewhere. I was lucky when I got to the Senate that there were \nopenings on both the Education and Environment Committees.\n  Early on, I learned what the Senate can be at its best. In 1989, \nCongress was in the midst of reauthorizing the Clean Air Act. Even \nthough I was a freshman, the door was open for anyone who had the time \nand interest. As John Chafee, George Mitchell, and the rest of us \nforged a strong renewal of the Clean Air Act, I realized these were the \nmoments I enjoyed most. I realized these were the moments I enjoyed \nmost when smart and committed people worked together to solve tough \nproblems and improve the lot for Americans. Every year since has \nprovided similar moments, from rebuilding our roads to rewriting our \nfood and drug laws.\n  Probably the biggest and the most rewarding challenge for me has been \nin the area of education. From my first year in the House when we \nenacted the Education of the Handicapped Act, to work that continues \ntoday on the Higher Education Act, I have tried to do my best to ensure \nthat every child is given the opportunity to reach his or her \npotential.\n  There is plenty of work left to be done to reach this goal, and \nnowhere is that more true than in the District of Columbia. A decade \nago, Congress stepped in to try and help the District resolve the \nproblems plaguing its overall budget and its schools in particular. As \nchair of the DC Appropriations Subcommittee, I helped lead that effort. \nThe city is to be commended for its record of fiscal responsibility in \nthe years since, and I hope the superintendent, the new mayor, the \ncouncil, and the school board will be able to make similar progress in \nimproving the city's school system.\n  While Vermont has always been home, I have lived in the District of \nColumbia since coming to Washington. Luckily, I have never lost the \nability to be moved by the sight of the Capitol dome. Its majesty \nstruck me when I first came to Washington and it still does today. \nUnder that dome and in the buildings around it work thousands of good \npeople. We are all privileged to work with a whole host of people who \nget too little recognition, from the person recording my words, to the \npeople who put them in the Congressional Record while we sleep--not \nalways easy tasks, in my case.\n  Ours, too, is not always an easy task. I know it is hard for the \npublic to understand the reality of life in the Congress, but the \ncontinual travel, the campaigns, and the unpredictable hours of our \njobs can take a toll on our families. I have been blessed with two \nwonderful children, Laura and Leonard, who are here with me today, and \na feisty, funny, and an incredibly strong wife, Liz. They have had to \nput up with an awful lot over the years so that I could serve Vermont.\n  Three decades is a blink of an eye in history, but what a tremendous \nperiod of change in our country we have been through. When I came to \nWashington, we were only three decades removed from the Second World \nWar. My childhood heroes were heroes of that war, and it seemed as \nthough every family had a father or son or uncle who served and \nsacrificed in that war. But when I came to Washington, an entirely \ndifferent war was being waged in Southeast Asia. Vietnam has colored \nmuch of our thinking since. Whether Vietnam had too much or too little \ninfluence upon the ensuing three decades is a much larger debate, but \nwe would be better served in world affairs today by being less haughty \nand more humble.\n  I regret that my departure from Congress, like my arrival, finds our \ncountry at war. Young and even not so young Americans are sacrificing \nlife and limb while the rest of us are making little or no sacrifice. \nIt seems to me the very least we should do is pay today for the fiscal \ncosts of our policies. Instead, we are floating IOUs written on our \nchildren's future. This year we have no budget, and we are unwilling \neven to debate most of our basic spending bills before the November \nelection. Thirty years from now, we could well face the biggest crisis \nin government since the Civil War, if Congress and the White House do \nnot adopt a more honest approach to government.\n\n  The basic compact between generations is being broken. F.D.R. was \nright to borrow heavily to finance World War II, but are we justified \nin doing so today?\n  Earlier this month, I was privileged to attend the dedication of a \nmonument in Virginia commemorating the sacrifice of more than 1,200 men \nof the Vermont Brigade during the battle of the wilderness. The tangled \nthickets of the 19th century have given way to mature forests. The \nindividuals are largely forgotten, but our collective memory must \nendure. Today, we use blocks of granite to remind us of the sacrifices \nof the Civil War. In its immediate aftermath you would think no such \nreminder would have been needed. But 140 years ago, so the story goes, \na northern Congressman literally waved a bloody shirt before his \ncolleagues to inflame them against the South for alleged misdeeds. True \npatriotism is the incredible bravery of those men whose too-brief lives \nended on that wilderness battlefield. Waving the bloody shirt then or \ntoday is anything but patriotic.\n  The beautiful Capitol dome above us, completed even as the Civil War \nconcluded, should serve to inspire us. I am an optimist and have been \nevery day of my life. With Lincoln, I hope that the mystic cords of \nmemory will stretch from every battlefield and patriot grave to the \nhearts of the living, and that we will soon again be touched by the \nbetter angels of our nature.\n  Mr. President, I wish you and all of my colleagues good luck and \nGodspeed.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter). The minority leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senator Jeffords has been a friend and \ncolleague for many years. We had the opportunity to serve together in \nthe House of Representatives. We served together in the Senate. To say \nthat he has made history during his time in Congress is an \nunderstatement. But more important, he has made a difference. I have \nalways been impressed by his knowledge of the issues, his dedication to \nthe public well-being, and the environment. I have had the good fortune \nof serving with him on the Environment and Public Works Committee. He \nis a stalwart. He is a true believer that the environment is in \ndistress and things need to be done to change our environment.\n  He has worked to preserve the middle class and to provide for the \nsafety of the American people in so many different ways. Senator \nJeffords is a man of conscience. No one can question that. He grew up \nin Vermont where the Jeffords family first settled in the 18th century. \nHis father was a longtime member of the Supreme Court. After Jim \nJeffords graduated from Yale, he served in the Navy on active duty for \n4 years. He served then in the Naval Reserve, retiring as a captain. \nSenator Jeffords studied law at Harvard--Yale and Harvard--which shows \nhis intellect. He returned after having finished law school to Vermont \nto practice law. Shortly thereafter, he was elected to the Vermont \nState Senate and then attorney general. He was elected to the House of \nRepresentatives in 1975 and served there until he came to the Senate in \n1989.\n  In walking in here I grabbed a book that has a lot of definitions. I \nflipped to courage. Whatever definition you have of courage, you can \npick one here going back to two centuries ago:\n\n       I love the man who can smile on trouble, who can gather \n     strength from distress and grow brave by reflection. It is \n     the business of little minds to shrink, but he whose heart is \n     firm and whose conscience has approved his conduct will \n     pursue his principles unto death.\n\n  That really is Jim Jeffords, and that, Mr. President, is a quote from \nThomas Payne. I have seen up close Jim Jeffords' courage. Everyone \nknows, as it has been written about in books, the conversations that \nSenator Jeffords and I had prior to Senator Jeffords deciding that he \nwanted to\n\n[[Page S10226]]\n\nchange course and become an Independent. That was not an easy decision. \nIt involved years of friendship, and it involved years of his being a \nmember of two different legislative bodies on Capitol Hill.\n  Most of our discussions took place on the Senate floor as people were \nwalking around, but we had conversations in private. I know firsthand, \nI repeat, of the courage of this man. I in my now long public career \nhave been involved in a number of things that I will always remember, \nbut I will never, ever remember anything more vividly than the Senator \nfrom Vermont, as a matter of principle and courage, changing not only \nhis course but the course of this country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have listened to my friend, Jim Jeffords, \nthe Senator from Vermont speak here this morning. I couldn't help but \nthink as I heard Senator Jeffords speak with wit and clarity, and you \nmight say even some emotion, that Jim Jeffords, given the opportunity \nto make a speech--and many of us will do so on this Senate floor as we \nleave--did it being true to himself, with his own good nature, his own \nsense of history, and his own justifiable pride in what he has \naccomplished.\n  I have known Jim Jeffords from his days as a State senator in \nRutland. I have known his wonderful wife, Liz Daley Jeffords. They are \nboth dear friends of mine and my wife Marcel. Mrs. Jeffords was \nreferred to as a great lady the other night by the anchor of our \nState's largest TV station. Some of us who have known Jim for years \nwould say she gets that greatness for putting up with him for all these \nyears. But we Vermonters found no difficulties in putting up with Jim \nJeffords. He has been elected overwhelmingly to the offices he has held \nand he has done it with support from Republicans, Democrats, and \nIndependents alike. He has gotten these votes the old-fashioned way--he \nearned them.\n\n  We came here together 32 years ago. I like to talk about the Leahys \ncoming to Vermont in the 1850s. Jim reminds me his family came to \nVermont a century before. We both live in small towns in Vermont; we \nhave had that sense of Vermont. He has never lost it. He has been a \ngood friend.\n  His career highlights are legendary. Let me tell you why he is \nsupported so. First and foremost, Senator Jeffords is known as an \nenvironmental champion. In Vermont, they say, If you scratch a \nVermonter you scratch an environmentalist, no matter the party.\n  He has done it in the great tradition of Senator Bob Stafford. \nSenator Bob Stafford is also from the same county as Jim Jeffords--\nactually Jim grew up near him. He mentioned Bob today.\n  He carved out a legend on education and the environment when he was \nhere. But then Jim Jeffords had done that as attorney general and as a \nState senator in our State. For the past three decades he has left his \nfingerprints on nearly every environmental law enacted, from the Clean \nAir Act and the Clean Water Act to the Superfund program to acid rain \nreduction.\n  In fact, when others in his position would be thinking about where \nare the papers going and how will we retire, just a matter of months \nago he offered the boldest solution to combat global climate change \nthis body has ever considered.\n  He has championed legislation to strengthen our Nation's education \nsystem and increase the opportunities for individuals with \ndisabilities.\n  In 1975, as a brandnew Member of the House of Representatives, as he \nsaid, coming in with a neck brace--the walking wounded from an election \nwhere both of us ran in Vermont--he coauthored what would later be \nknown as the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, IDEA. It was \nstrongly supported by his colleagues here in the Senate and before that \nin the House. It has provided equal access to education for millions of \nstudents with disabilities, students who otherwise would have been \nshunted aside and this country would not have had the value of their \nachievements.\n  As chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pension Committee, he \nworked tirelessly on education, job training, and disability \nlegislation. Most recently, his leadership in the Senate Environment \nand Public Works Committee was essential to the passage of the highway \nbill. Of course, Vermont and the rest of the country will benefit from \nthat.\n  I might say there has been no greater leader for Vermont's dairy \nindustry than Senator Jeffords. In his work on the Northeast Dairy \nCompact and the milk programs, he has fought tough battles for Vermont \ndairies--and won. He actually knows as much about our dairy industry as \nmost dairy farmers.\n  It is what he has done for future generations. All of us can talk \nabout what we do here. It is what we leave for our children and our \ngrandchildren that counts. Future generations of Vermonters will honor \nJim's legacy when they see the work that he began as attorney general \nand continued throughout the Senate--helping to restore Lake Champlain \nto its brilliance, its magnificence; or witness the bald eagles \nabounding in the wilderness areas, thanks to Jim.\n  I applaud him for this statement as he takes leave of the Senate--\nalthough it seems this year we will never know when we leave. None of \nus are getting our final airplane reservations yet. But he has done it \nwith his usual grace and good humor. I applaud him for that and I hope \nall of us when we come to leave, whenever that may be, will have the \nopportunity to show that same grace. He served Vermont well and, just \nas importantly, he served the Senate well.\n  After a long career I might violate the rules somewhat, addressing my \nfriend and colleague directly: For a long career, Jeff, you can leave \nwith your head held high. You have served Vermont and your Nation \nproudly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise for the purpose of telling my \ncolleagues that I am going to miss my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I will interrupt the good Senator. Because the \nminority controls the next 7 minutes, it is necessary to gain consent \nfrom the minority.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask consent the Senator from Iowa be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to tell the Senator from Vermont \nthat I am going to miss him in the Senate and still consider him a \nfriend. I hope to have a long relationship with him, even in his \nretirement. I am that Senator that Jim Jeffords, the Senator from \nVermont, referred to as the one remaining Republican of the class of \n1974. There were 17 of us. I think there were about 70 Democrats. It \nwas a bad year for Republicans. You couldn't even put the word \nRepublican on your literature. It was the year Nixon resigned.\n  There were only 140 of us in the House of Representatives at that \ntime. I don't know whether Senator Jeffords felt this way, but I felt \nthis way, that it was probably the end of the Republican Party. Well, I \nwas wrong. He and I have been reelected to serve together, to serve our \nrespective constituents.\n  I remember Senator Jeffords as an outstanding member of the \nAgriculture Committee in the House of Representatives the 6 years I \nserved on that committee. Then there was a period of time where I was a \nMember of the Senate and he still stayed in the House of \nRepresentatives. Our friendship still held. But working together--you \nknow how it is in Congress, the House and Senate; there is a Grand \nCanyon between us sometimes, and we don't communicate as much as we \nought to. Consequently, it was like getting reacquainted with Senator \nJeffords again when he came to the Senate. I was glad then and I am \nvery glad now that he continued his service.\n  I think he is an outstanding example of probably what is an \nunacknowledged principle of political science--at least it is a feeling \nI have about the people of our country--that if you serve honorably \nwhere you are at a certain time and do the best job possible, you are \ngoing to have opportunities to enhance your position within public \nservice. So as a State senator, then as an attorney general, then as a \nCongressman, and then as a Senator for the people of Vermont, I believe \nhe got to be a Senator because people in Vermont recognized him, as a \nState senator, as a Congressman, and as an attorney general,\n\n[[Page S10227]]\n\nas a person who was not there because of political ambition, wanting to \nrise to the top, but a person, in each stage of his public service \nlife, who did what that job required and did it well. People recognized \nthat and in the end of the process, he came to the Senate.\n  In every relationship I have had with Senator Jeffords, whether he \nwas Republican or an Independent, it has always been one that has been \nfriendly and honorable and honest, and, most importantly, to describe \nhim as a humanitarian as he approached public policy.\n  It seemed to me that as a Member of the Senate, whether as an \nIndependent or as a Republican, Senator Jeffords brought forth what it \ntakes to get things done in the Senate, and that is moderation. It \ndoesn't matter whether it is a bill that is representing the philosophy \nof the extreme left or a bill that represents the philosophy of the \nextreme right, nothing such as that is going to get through the Senate. \nEventually you have to have people come together seeking a middle \nground, a bipartisan approach to get things done. It seems to me, in \nevery respect, that is what Senator Jeffords did--he sought moderation \nbecause that is how you get solutions and that is the only way the \nSenate produces.\n  I compliment him on his dedicated public service. I congratulate him \non his long service to the people of the United States and the people \nof Vermont. I will miss working with him. I will miss him, but I hope \nwe have opportunities to have great relationships for the rest of our \nlives.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, could I inquire of the Chair, do we have \na limited period of time? I see a number of our colleagues here. I am \njust inquiring of the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 7 minutes 20 seconds remaining in \nthis block of time for the minority.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Well, I see the floor leader. I will take 2 or 3 \nminutes, then, because I see half a dozen of our friends here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I believe there are at least four or five \nMembers here who would like to speak about Senator Jeffords' \nretirement. I ask unanimous consent those Members currently on the \nfloor, Senators Rockefeller, Boxer, Harkin, Dodd and Kennedy, be \nrecognized for such time as they consume, and I would like to add \nmyself to that list, and then extend whatever time we use on the \nminority side, if they would like to use it as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is entirely appropriate that we take \nthese few moments on the floor of the Senate to listen carefully and \ntake the measure of an extraordinary Senator, Senator Jim Jeffords. In \nthese next several weeks, this Nation is going to be focused in many, \nmany States on trying to select who is going to represent them in the \nSenate. And if the people of those States just took a few moments to \nlisten to the eloquence of this Senator, they would know what the \nstandard should be in selecting someone to represent them in this body. \nIt is Jim Jeffords. He sets the standard. So we thank Jim Jeffords for \nhis service--his service to the State of Vermont and his service to all \nof our States and to the country. We thank him for that service.\n  We also thank the people of Vermont for their wisdom in selecting \nthis extraordinary talent and giving him the kind of support that they \ngave over a long and distinguished career, especially in those times \nwhen he was willing to take positions and stand up on issues as a \nmatter of conscience. They understood their native son. They respected \nhim, and they supported him. So thank you to the voters of Vermont.\n  Thank you to his family, Elizabeth that Senator Jeffords mentioned, \nLaura, and Leonard--a family that gave him great support. I think those \nof us who have been fortunate enough to know that family and meet that \nfamily understand what a strong influence it has been in terms of his \nservice.\n  And thank you, Senator Jeffords, for that simple eloquence that we \nheard from you today on the floor of the Senate, going back into the \nhistory of our country, providing inspiration as we listen to you talk \nabout the history of the Nation, mentioning with great pride the role \nof Vermonters in the time of the Civil War--and his understanding of \nhistory, talking about the Greatest Generation, which were inspiring \nfigures to him and many of us continuing to the present.\n  He typically understated his own achievements and accomplishments. I \nthink many of us on this floor are well familiar with them. I certainly \nam as someone who has had the good opportunity to serve with him on the \nEducation Committee. I know the difference that he has made in the \neducation of children in this country, particularly those with special \nneeds, accomplishments which are memorable and historical. He mentioned \njust causally his interest in the education of the children here in the \nDistrict of Columbia. A number of us who are here on the floor now \nremember Jim Jeffords speaking in our caucus not many years ago how \nthat we, as members of the Senate who happen to either live here in the \nDistrict or work here, even though we are working in this body, have a \nresponsibility for the education of the children here. He was the \ninspiration of a program, a literacy program called ``Everybody Wins!'' \nAnd Jim Jeffords led a number of us to Brent School here near the \nCapitol to read with the second and third graders each week to ensure \nthat those children were going to have an opportunity to learn to read. \nIt was just a simple illustration, once again, that Jim Jeffords does \nnot just talk the talk, he walks the walk. And on so many different \ntimes, he has been there doing just that.\n  So, Jim, we admire your service. You have demonstrated here--and we \ndo not understand perhaps well enough--that you can speak with a quiet \nand soft voice, but you speak with a great passion and a compelling \nargument, and with a simplicity and effectiveness that has enriched and \nenhanced the quality of life and opportunity, particularly for children \nbut also for all Americans. It is a distinguished career, and it is one \nI know that you should be--and are--proud of. All of us have had our \nown lives enriched and inspired because of our friendship with you and \nthe type of Senator you have been.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I add my voice to my colleagues who have \nspoken and those who will speak in thanking our wonderful friend from \nVermont for his remarkable service to our country.\n  I begin as well by thanking his family, Elizabeth and the children, \nas well as the people of Vermont, as Senator Kennedy has said so \neloquently.\n  Let me also include in enumeration his wonderful staff people, over \nthe years, who have been very much a part of Jim's family. In fact, I \nnote from the interns to senior staff people, everyone refers to him \nnot as ``Senator'' or ``Mr. Chairman''--but just ``Jim.'' That is \ncertainly a symbol of the kind of relationship he has had with his \nconstituents and with his family over the years.\n  I have had the privilege of serving my entire time in the Senate--in \nthe Congress--with this remarkable person from Vermont. We arrived in \nthe House of Representatives on the very same day, 32 years ago. As Jim \npointed out, he had that neck brace on, and I had a head of black hair. \nWe have aged over those 3 decades. But my respect for Jim Jeffords has \nonly grown.\n  He has taught us America will listen to you even if your voice is \nsoft. His achievements in the Senate and the House are the envy of all \nwho wish to improve a quality of life in this great country of ours. \nJim's body of work is truly admirable.\n  But it looks even more admirable when you remind yourself that it was \nall the doing of a man unpretentious enough to be fond of mismatched \nsocks, frugal enough to spend his earliest days in Washington sleeping \nin a parked van, and humble enough to be universally known, as I've \nsaid, as just ``Jim.'' The people of Vermont returned him to office \nover and over again on the strength of his plainspoken integrity and \nhis indefatigable Yankeeness. That's what Jim brought to this body of \ndiscussion; and that was more than enough.\n\n[[Page S10228]]\n\n  Jim came to Washington knowing what he wanted to accomplish, and his \nsuccess is clear to us today. No one has worked with more dedication \nfor a clean environment. Jim was an environmentalist practically before \nwe had a word for it. In fact, he got his start in the Vermont State \nSenate in the 1960s, fighting the efforts of the paper mills to pour \nsludge right into Lake Champlain. He was a long-time nuclear watchdog \nand among six Congressmen to found the Congressional Solar Coalition \nyears ago. It is telling that when he had his pick of chairmanships, \nSenator Jim Jeffords chose the Environment and Public Works Committee. \nPerhaps most importantly, he helped clean up the air we breathe. He \nmentioned it briefly. But the work of John Chafee, George Mitchell, and \nJim Jeffords truly created the great Clean Air Act of 1990, a huge \naccomplishment. I want to thank Jim immensely for the tremendous effort \nhe made years ago in improving the quality of air in this country. If \nhe had done nothing else in 32 years, that alone would have been a \nsignificant achievement. Of course, his body of work is far more than \nthat.\n  Like Jim's dedication to the environment, his work for children who \ncome from special education needs is decades long. In 1976, he was \nessential to the passage of legislation guaranteeing local school \ndistricts that the Federal Goverment would pay 40 percent of the costs \nof educating the disabled. And if that guarantee remains unfunded \ntoday, never let it be said that it was for lack of Jim's passionate \nwork.\n  I would be remiss if I didn't mention of Tom Harkin, another fellow \nclassmate of 1974, working with Jim and many others who cared about \nthis issue over the years. No one contributed more to the Individuals \nwith Disabilities Education Act than Jim Jeffords. Few Senators are as \ntied to special education, and that is a title to be very proud of. It \nhas been my honor to work along with him in the House and the Senate on \nthe issues that meant the most to him--on afterschool programs, on \nhigher education, and, most especially, to secure funding for IDEA.\n  It Vermont, commitment to education is a longstanding tradition. \nRight in the middle of the Civil War, we building the dome on the \nCapitol to show our determination to keep this Union together; but we \nshowed it in another way, too. A Senator from Vermont by the name of \nJustin Smith Morrill created the land grant colleges--the University of \nConnecticut is one; there are many all across the country--and his work \nwas one more demonstration of the remarkable people who come from that \nState of Vermont to help build this country, defend this country, and \nsecure this country for our children. Senator Stafford and Morrill \npassed on that proud tradition, and Senator Jeffords stands in its \nforefront today.\n  Jim has taught at every opportunity the difference between education \nas a privilege and education as a right. It is a right, and its worth \nis measured in our willingness to educate even--especially--where it is \ninconvenient.\n  There weren't many Senators shyer than Jim Jeffords, but there wasn't \na single one fuller of quiet purpose and courage. Politics was always a \nmeans to Jim's purpose--never the other way around. And the way Jim \npracticed politics, the way he spent his power, was never calculated to \nbring him money, or fame, or even particularly glamour. It was only the \nquiet satisfaction of a job very well done.\n  That is what I think of when I recall the more than three decades of \nour service together. But, to tell the truth, through all those 30 \nyears I had a privileged seat right here with him. Those without that \nvantage point are probably going to remember, first of all, something \nvery different. We all know how Jim crossed this aisle for good 5 years \nago, and how he has served as an an Independent ever since. Jim entered \nthe national spotlight full of honest regret, and fully aware of how \ndifficult his choice was for colleagues, his staff, and his supporters.\n  I saw Jim upclose as he struggled with a decision as few men or women \never have to. But whatever one thinks of it, there is a fact beyond \ndispute, which all of us appreciate in this body: Jim Jeffords has \nnever followed anyone but his conscience.\n  If we insist, 5 years later, on reasoning out the need in votes or \ndollars or any other measure of practicality, we only reveal our \nfailure to understand what that man did on the day he made his choice. \nSometimes what goes on in this Chamber cannot be reasoned away. Jim \ntaught us that, too.\n  So, I would like to close with a happy thought. Two years before the \nAmerican Revolution, Edmund Burke gave a speech on the relationship \nbetween a representative and those whom he tries to represent.\n  ``It is his duty,'' said Burke, ``to sacrifice his repose, his \npleasures, his satisfactions, to theirs; and above all, ever, and in \nall cases, to prefer their interests to his own. But his unbiased \nopinion, his mature judgment, his enlightened conscience, he ought not \nto sacrifice to you, to any man, or to any set of men living. These he \ndoes not derive from your pleasure; no, nor from the law and the \nconstitution. They are a trust from Providence.''\n  Jim, you have kept your trust over these many years, in both the \nSenate and public life, in your State and in the Congress. We send you \nback to Vermont with your work in the Senate accomplished, with your \nconscience still clean, and with our best wishes to you and your lovely \nfamily. God bless you.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it took an act of courage for Jim Jeffords \nto declare himself an Independent. It took an act of courage for a \nlifelong Red Sox fan to quote a New York Yankee in his farewell address \nto the Senate.\n  Jim Jeffords is an extraordinary public servant. Fewer than 2,000 men \nand women in the history of the United States of America have served in \nthe Senate. We all understand the great privilege of being in this body \nrepresenting our great States. But people are not noted in the history \nof the Senate for longevity alone. People are noted for singular acts \nof courage. And when it comes to Jim Jeffords, his public career has \nbeen a singular act of courage.\n  I hail from the State of Abraham Lincoln, where he lived most of his \nadult life, and where we claimed him as part of our national heritage. \nWhen I think of Jim Jeffords and the political party he identifies with \nmore than any other name, I will say he identifies with the party of \nthat great leader Abraham Lincoln who stood up for principles often \nagainst public and popular will.\n  This last week, Time Magazine noted they were going to designate \nSenator Jim Jeffords of Vermont as ``Person of the Week.'' They said in \nhis one principled decision to become an Independent, ``He demonstrated \nto the White House and the United States Senate that revolutionaries \noften come in surprising packages.''\n  We all know what happened after Jim made his decision to become an \nIndependent. He told me about walking home to his apartment at night \ndown Pennsylvania Avenue. And people who were outside restaurants and \ncafes would stop and stand and start to applaud, and Jim would be \nstartled by it at first. But he received more recognition then he, I am \nsure, expected. A lot of it came in positive terms; some in negative \nterms. People wanted to name their babies after him.\n  In Burlington, VT--I think this is probably the greatest tribute a \npolitician could ever expect--they named a beer after him--``Jeezum \nJim'' they called it. I hope it was a popular brew because he has been \na popular Senator.\n  When they asked him why he changed his affiliation to become an \nIndependent, he replied very simply: ``It is all about education.'' I \nremember it well, because I know that was the deciding factor.\n  Your commitment to particularly those students who struggled with \ndisabilities, students who have these difficulties, your commitment to \nthose kids led you to this decision. Many of us make these decisions on \nvotes on the floor. But as has been said, for Jim Jeffords education \nwent way beyond a vote or a speech. Several years ago, he established \nthis tutoring program in Washington, DC, encouraging us, as Members of \nCongress, the House and the Senate, to walk just a few blocks from \nhere, as he did so many times, to tutor the inner-city youth of \nWashington, DC.\n\n  He is a true Vermonter and a true Independent. When we look at his \nrecord, he was the only House Republican who voted against the Reagan \ntax\n\n[[Page S10229]]\n\ncut because he was afraid it would lead to dangerous deficits. How \nright he was. In 1993, he was the only Republican Senator to cosponsor \nPresident Clinton's health care plan. He worked for years for \nregulation of tobacco by the Food and Drug Administration, a goal which \nI share with the Senator. And he sponsored the Employment \nNondiscrimination Act, banning employment discrimination on the basis \nof sexual orientation.\n  Some politicians in their career find ways to divide us. Jim Jeffords \nalways looked for ways to bring us together. A strong supporter of \nFederal funding for AIDS research and the arts, justifiably proud of \nthe role he played in passing the Work Incentives Improvement Act, and, \nof course, his record on the environment is without parallel.\n  I know historians will also record all these accomplishments and \ncourageous battles when they write about Jim Jeffords. On July 4, 2001, \nseveral weeks after he made his decision to become an Independent, he \nsat down at his home in Vermont and wrote these words:\n\n       I hope my decision will move the two parties to the center, \n     where the American people are. The American people want an \n     active, responsible, Federal Government.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       There seems to be a hunger in country for heroes, \n     especially for the political variety.\n\n  Not only with this one historic act of conscience but throughout his \ncareer in the House and the Senate, in public life Jim Jeffords has \nbeen a living example of these hopes and beliefs. I am proud to have \nbeen able to serve with him. I am proud to count him as one of my \ncolleagues, even prouder to count him as a friend.\n  I thank his family for giving him this opportunity to serve and \ngiving this wonderful man to public life.\n  I thank you, Jim Jeffords, for all you have meant.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, it is, indeed, a privilege to be here this \nmorning to personally hear the words of our good friend, Senator \nJeffords, and to hear other Senators get up and talk about Jim in such \nglowing terms.\n  However, I must say that all the years I have known Jim Jeffords, he \nis an old-fashioned New Englander, which means he is very modest. That \nmeans he is embarrassed to receive this kind of praise and adulation. \nSenator Jeffords will just have to endure it because we love you, we \nrespect you, we admire you, and you are one of the most beloved Members \nof the Senate.\n  Thirty-two years ago, we came together in the House. You talked about \nthat. Our colleague, Chris Dodd, was in that class, and also my \ncolleague from Iowa, Senator Grassley. I didn't know Senator Jeffords \nat that time, obviously. We had just come in as freshmen Members. I \nfound myself on the Committee on Agriculture with Senator Jeffords. We \nboth sat down at the end. He was on one side and I was on the other \nside because we were just freshmen.\n  We had a farm bill coming up. After a few weeks on the Agriculture \nCommittee, we dubbed Senator Jeffords ``the Senator from Dairy.'' He \nwas tenacious in fighting for his dairy farmers of Vermont and, of \ncourse, New England. Those from Iowa and Minnesota and Wisconsin--we \nhad dairy farmers, too, and there was, shall I say, a little bit of a \nconflict in how we viewed the world of milk and dairy. That was my \nfirst experience with Senator Jeffords because we had to work things \nout. And we did. That was the first time I got to see the kind of \nperson Jim Jeffords is and always has been. He was tenacious in \nfighting for his dairy farmers but willing to understand that we all \nhave to live together; somehow we have to seek our compromises. And we \ndid. We reached a compromise and we moved the legislation forward. That \nwas the first time I came to really know and respect Jim Jeffords.\n\n  As we moved ahead in agriculture, I found another area in which I \nrespected and admired Senator Jeffords. That was the area of \nenvironment and conservation. In those days, people were thinking \nmostly about all the commodity programs, how much money we could get in \nthe commodity programs. We were all protecting our interests. I was \nprotecting my Iowa interests and Senator Jeffords was protecting his \nVermont interests.\n  However, conservation transcended everything. That began back in the \nlate 1970s, in the House Agriculture Committee. We began the move \ntoward more conservation in our farm bills, which led to more of a \n``greening'' of America. He did that work also on Environment and \nPublic Works. When I think about the environment, cleaning up the \nenvironment--clean water, clean lakes, clean streams--I have to think \nof Jim Jeffords. He was there at the beginning.\n  Then in 1975, on the Committee on Education, Jim Jeffords coauthored \nwhat later became the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. I \nwas not on the Committee on Education, but because of my family and \nbecause of my intense interest in disability rights, especially as it \npertained to the hard-of-hearing and the deaf, I learned about this \nbill with Jim Jeffords and with Paul Simon--at that time, Senator \nSimon--and sort of stuck my nose in their business, if you don't mind \nmy saying that, because I was not on the committee. I talked about how \nwe had to help do some of these things. My focus was narrow at that \ntime, just in hard-of-hearing and deafness at that time. My great \nrespect for Senator Jeffords, or Jim, at that time grew because he was \nfocused on how we make sure every kid in America gets an education, \nmake sure kids with disabilities were mainstream, make sure they got \nthe support in our schools.\n  It was Senator Jeffords who made sure that in the bill we passed, the \nFederal Government committed itself to providing at least 40 percent of \nthe additional costs to States and local communities in educating kids \nwith disabilities. Forty percent was the goal we set in the bill \nSenator Jeffords coauthored in 1975.\n  That moves me up to the year 2001. In the year 2001, the budget came \nfrom the White House, President Bush's budget, which severely \nunderfunded our commitment to increasing funding. We have never reached \n40 percent. I think the highest we have been is 18 percent. We have \nnever gotten the 40 percent. Senator Jeffords wanted to move that up. \nYet the budget came down and had a severe cut in the funding for the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act. That is when Senator \nJeffords said no, he wanted to make sure that money was in there. That \nhappened, mostly, on the Republican side of the aisle. I was not privy \nto all of that. That is when Senator Jeffords made his declaration of \nindependence. A matter of conscience--he could not turn his back on all \nthese years of moving our society forward to educating kids with \ndisabilities in our schools and then all of a sudden say: No, we are \ngoing to turn the clock back; we are not going to do it. He wanted to \nkeep moving forward. The budget would not allow it; he fought hard for \nit. Based upon the fact that the administration would not move on that, \nhe declared his independence and became an Independent and left his \nparty. We can all imagine how wrenching that must be, to leave the \nparty that nurtured us, that we grew up with, that supported us all our \nadult life. It is a matter of conscience. You can read about it in his \nbook, ``My Declaration of Independence.''\n  After that, I invited Senator Jeffords to come out to speak at the \nsteak fry I have in Iowa every year. It was after the book came out. I \nwill never forget the scene. We had thousands of people. It was a \nbeautiful sunny Sunday afternoon. Thousands of people came to meet this \nperson, to hear him and to hear his message. They had all these little \nbooks they were waiving, ``My Declaration of Independence.''\n  He had a wonderful message. His message was: don't ever turn our back \non making sure every child in America has a decent education. It was a \nsimple, straightforward message. But you should read his book.\n  Senator Kennedy mentioned another thing about Senator Jeffords that \nnot too many people know about; that is, his support for a program \ncalled ``Everybody Wins.'' He brought it here to Washington in the late \n1990s and then began badgering us to participate in it in his usual \ntenacious manner. So he got a lot of us hooked on it.\n  It is every Tuesday. I see Senator Kennedy goes about every Tuesday; \nJim, of course, goes all the time; I go\n\n[[Page S10230]]\n\nevery Tuesday we are here, and a lot of staff members. We go to Brent \nElementary School. We read to a child for 1 hour every Tuesday. It has \nbeen a wonderful experience for me and I know for everyone who \nparticipates in it. In fact, we now talk about Jim as being sort of the \nJohnny Appleseed of this movement because now it is starting in other \nStates. We took the idea to Iowa, and now it is sprouting in Iowa. \nOther States and businesses are involved. ``Everybody Wins'' is now \nmoving around the country. Senator Kennedy said: Senator Jeffords \ndoesn't just talk the talk, he walks the walk. When he brought it here, \nhe was there every week reading to kids and getting us to go down and \nread to them, also.\n\n  I have in my office a big picture that is my favorite picture. It is \na big picture taken at Tiananmen Square, a picture we all will remember \nof the young man holding a little briefcase, a young student holding a \nbriefcase. There is a line of tanks. He is standing in front of the \ntanks, and the tanks have all stopped. To those of us who have seen the \nvideo of this, the tanks were coming down the street, the student went \nout in the street, he stopped, the tanks turned to go one direction and \nhe moved over a few steps, then the tanks moved another direction to \nget around, and he moved over and stood there. Finally, the tanks \nstopped right in front of him. A hatch popped open, and a military guy \ngot out and looked at him and stood there for a few minutes. The tanks \nall stopped, and then the young man turned and walked off the street.\n  A lot of people I talk to about that picture--did they ever know who \nhe was? No, they never did find out his name. But I gave them the name. \nI call him Jim Jeffords. To me, that young man who did that represents \nthe Jim Jeffords of the world, willing to stand on principle no matter \nwhat the odds are. No matter what is coming at them, they are willing \nto stand on principle.\n  So after 32 years, we will miss this soft-spoken and self-effacing \nNew Englander who has a spine of steel. After 32 years, Senator \nJeffords, you have left your mark: education, job training, disability \nrights, the environment and, lest we forget, the dairy farmers of New \nEngland, who will never forget Jim Jeffords.\n  Jim, we are going to miss you, your kindness, your leadership, your \ncourage, your generosity of spirit, and your example. Know that our \nlove, our admiration, our respect, and our best wishes go with you and \nwith Elizabeth and your family. Know that you have left on our Nation \nand the world a mark for all of us to follow in how to make our Nation \nand our world a better place.\n  Senator Jeffords, Jim, Godspeed. Come back now and then. Come back on \nthe floor. Retired Senators have the privilege of coming to the floor. \nCome back on the floor and remind us why we are here.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this is a very poignant morning for so \nmany. I am so glad I have been able to arrange my schedule to be here \nto listen to my colleagues and friends, whom I deeply respect, and to \nlisten to the great Senator from Vermont, Jim Jeffords.\n  If I might say how blessed I have been, I got here in 1993 and went \nright to the Environment and Public Works Committee. I met Jim there, \nand now I get to sit next to him in the Senate. I got to know his \nstaff.\n\n  We are going to miss you. But, Jim, I must say, you made a beautiful \nspeech today. And in listening to Tom Harkin talk about you and explain \nthat you have always been motivated by what is right for the people, if \never you could take an opportunity to tout your accomplishments, it is \nwhen you say goodbye. People would say that is fair. But you did not do \nthat. You did not say: This year I passed this legislation and this \nbill. The rest of us have been lauding your accomplishments, but it is \njust like you, instead, to talk about this country you love so much. \nAnd you cite to us what our challenges are. And, of course, they \ncontinue to be the challenges you have taken up: education, the \nenvironment, fiscal responsibility, war and peace. You have left a \nroadmap for us, and for that we are very grateful.\n  I mentioned that I was sworn in in 1993. That was the so-called year \nof the women, where we tripled the number of women in the Senate. That \nsounds great, but it was from two to six. We were still a very strong \nminority. Our leader, Barbara Mikulski, the dean of the women here, \nalways taught us, from day one--she said: You are going to have to work \nwith the men because they control things here, and you are going to \nfind that among these many men there are many Sir Galahads.\n  Jim, you are Sir Galahad. You have been a wonderful friend to us, \ntreating us, from the minute we walked in, as equals and colleagues. We \nare very grateful to you for that.\n  I am not going to talk a long time at all. But I want to talk about \nthree things quickly. One is, I went to your State of Vermont this last \nweekend. I had been there before and always marveled at how beautiful \nit is, but I was taken with it again.\n  Now, coming from California, we have our beautiful places, believe \nme. So I have come to appreciate beautiful places. We overlooked Lake \nChamplain when we were there. Knowing that you worked so hard to make \nthat lake clean and beautiful, thank you for that. There is so much \nhistory there, Jim, that you have also helped to preserve--you and \nPatrick Leahy, and so many others who came before.\n  But what struck me about Vermont as much as the beauty is the \nincredible people in your State, how involved they are. It is that old \nNew England townhall type of quality. They get it. They are involved. \nThey love you, Jim. They love you. When I mentioned your name, oh, my \ngoodness, the roars came up. You could hear it blocks away.\n  People love you here and they love you in Vermont. And your family \nloves you. As you said, you are blessed, as we are blessed in your \npresence.\n  The second point is your family and how much they care about you. \nThey are so proud of you. I know how hard it was for them when you \ndeclared your independence. It rocked their world, just as it rocked \nyour world, and just as it rocked the country. But when you do \nsomething for the right reasons, it all works out. And you did \nsomething for the right reasons, for the people of this country.\n  The last thing I want to say to you is, we do not know how things \nwill work out this November, but either way, I will be taking a larger \nrole on the committee you love, the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, where you have been an extraordinary leader. You have given \nus a roadmap on how to fight global warming--a huge challenge we face. \nWe cannot turn away from it because if we do, we are neglecting our \nresponsibility. You, thank goodness, have written a bill that will show \nus the way.\n  So I am here today not only to wish you well in your retirement, and \njoy with your family, but to tell you that I am going to follow your \nleadership on global warming. I am excited about the challenge. And \nbecause of the love your colleagues feel for you, I hope you will come \nback here, as Tom Harkin said, to help me with that because we are \ngoing to have to move and get going on it.\n  Mr. President, thank you very much. And thanks to our colleagues for \ngiving us this time we need to pay tribute to an extraordinary Senator, \none who will be missed but never forgotten.\n  Thank you very much. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I have to start off anything I say--\nand I will be short--about Jim Jeffords with the word ``friendship,'' \nbased upon his unbelievable qualities of kindness, of goodness, of \nsteadfastness, being the same person every day under any circumstance.\n  We sit together. We have sat together for quite a long time on the \nfloor of the Senate. And we talk a lot. I have the honor of talking \nwith his staff, too, a superb staff, who adores him.\n  The business of friendship in the Senate is underpracticed. If you \nknow Jim Jeffords, then you know why you should take more time to know \nyour colleagues better. Because the fact is--although it has been more \nso recently--it is not your politics or your party that determines how \nyou vote, but your conscience and your sense of a moral compass that \nguides you. In that practice, you have to think of Jim Jeffords.\n\n[[Page S10231]]\n\n  He is an extraordinarily wonderful human being. He has got a \nferocious sense of humor, which is always delivered very quietly. And \nyet he is deep, he is profound, he sort of looks like Vermont: \nchiseled; his nose is just the right shape. And, of course, he talks \nthat way. But he is humble, not because he wants to be, just because he \nis. Nothing about his record is humble. But his nature is humble. He is \ngentle; and he really is. He listens, does not interrupt, does not \ninsist on his point of view--except when it counts, and then he is \nunmovable.\n  All of the subjects he has concentrated on--children, the \nenvironment, many other things that have been mentioned--there is also \nthe matter of post-traumatic stress disorder. On the Veterans \nCommittee, which is the one committee where I do get to--not the only \ncommittee, but I get to sit with him on that committee--he has been a \nchampion of something which Americans still do not really understand; \nand that is, the ferocious nature of being wounded in war these days--\nan Iraqi improvised explosive device that implants shards of metal into \npeople that will remain there for the rest of their lives; the whole \nquestion of How does somebody rehabilitate a life? and What is the VA \ndoing about that? Jim is all over that subject.\n  When he switched parties to be an Independent, woe be the person who \nsaid: Switch parties from Republican to Democrat--no--Republican to \nIndependent. And, yes, he got an enormous amount of cheering and praise \nbased upon his moral compass. He also got a lot of death threats. Life \nwas very hard for him for a period of time. So he understood that was \ngoing to happen. But with Jim Jeffords, the moral compass always \nprevails. I think it is one of the reasons all of us here respect him \nso, admire him so, look to him as to what the Senate ought to be.\n  I had never heard the word ``ANWR'' until it was explained to me by \nSenator Jeffords. He was there early because he was thinking, as \nalways, of our children and grandchildren, and, as they say, their \nchildren too. We always take it one generation too far, but it is true.\n  Alternative fuels. Will the history books write about Jim Jeffords on \nalternative fuels? Yes, they will. Do people generally in the Senate or \nelsewhere know that he has spent a career working on that? Probably \nnot.\n  Our air; they know about that. The groundwater; they probably know \nabout that. But his work on alternative fuels is one of the most \nimportant things he's done.\n  The Title I, Head Start, improving the lives of children, all of that \nthat has been talked about--Senator Harkin talked about, in 1975, the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act--he has always been looking \nahead. Does that make him a Good Samaritan? Does that mean he is a do-\ngooder or does it mean that he does good? It is the second. He does \nwhat is comfortable to him and what he feels is just for the people he \nserves, not only in Vermont but across the United States of America.\n  The work he has done with post-traumatic stress disorder is awesome \nin terms of those of us on the Veterans Committee. He is justifiably \nproud of the research and work done by Vermont's White River Junction \nVeterans' Administration Hospital to help veterans who are struggling, \nas they truly are, not just with the postwar physical problems of being \nwounded, but the psychological problems of that, as well.\n  He has never sought the limelight, and he does not care about the \nlimelight. He has been elected time after time probably partly because \nof that. Because he is not like so many other people who run for public \noffice who want to tick off everything they have done. He is Jim \nJeffords. And with Jim Jeffords comes a certain set of principles, a \ncertain set of commitments to people. The people of Vermont have \nunderstood that over the years. So he has not had to promote himself in \nways that others have to do.\n  He has always done his work, in the words of Shakespeare, with the \n``modest stillness and humility'' that becomes any human being. When \nyou look back at his record, you can see this man from Shrewsbury, VT, \nhas left his mark on virtually every single piece of legislation on \neducation, job training, disability legislation, and on and on and on.\n  Jim has always had extraordinarily deep passions and convictions, \nbut, at the same time, he has been a paragon of civility and \nhumbleness. Jim has a gentle voice, but his resolve and commitment to \nstand up for vulnerable children, veterans in need, and our environment \nis assertive and strong.\n  Throughout his career, Jim has made some very tough personal \ndecisions. Take his decision to switch parties to be an independent in \nthe summer of 2001. Regardless which party you are a member of, I think \nall of us would agree that given the fact that his move fundamentally \nchanged the governing structure of the Senate, it truly was a profile \nin courage. Time and time again, Jim has been willing to take risks for \nhis beliefs, and he deserves our respect and admiration for such \nindependence.\n  In terms of public service, Jim Jeffords has lived a life that many \naspire to. He has spent nearly every day of his life working to make \nthe lives of people better. In the 1950s, he served in the U.S. Navy, \nand until 1990 he was in the Naval Reserve, where he retired as a \ncaptain. In the 1960s, he began his political service, first as a \nVermont State Senator, then as Vermont's Attorney General, and then, in \nthe wake of the Watergate scandal, he became one of the very few \nRepublicans elected to Congress in 1974.\n  Jim has been a true steward of the environment. Long before many of \nus knew what ANWR was, he was fighting to preserve the environment for \nour grandchildren and their grandchildren. He has been at the forefront \nof fighting to make sure our air and ground water are safe for our \ncitizens, and he has fought for the use of alternative fuels. His \nefforts have truly cut a trailblazing path for many generations to \ncome.\n  Over the years, Jim and I have worked on many issues together, and I \nam particularly proud of what we have done for our students and for our \nveterans. He understands how important it is to make sure that our \ncitizens get started on the right foot. He believes that the first \nyears of a child's life are absolutely critical in the life and future \nof that person, and that is why he has worked so hard to push for \ngreater funding for Head Start and other early education programs. And \nthat is why he has worked on Title I--to help low-performing students, \nwho disproportionately live in the rural areas that make up much of \nWest Virginia and Vermont, achieve the standards they must meet.\n  That sort of Good Samaritan principle has always guided Jim's life \nand career. He has been extraordinary in advocating for those whose \nneeds are often forgotten. In fact, perhaps no American living today \nand certainly no American legislator--I want to echo here what Senator \nHarkin has said--has done more to advance the educational success of \nthose with disabilities. Almost from his arrival in Congress. Jim took \nextraordinary steps because he believed that the needs of others simply \ncould not wait. In 1975, as a House freshman, Jim co-authored what \nwould later be known as the Individual with Disabilities Education Act, \nIDEA. IDEA serves as a Federal commitment to give students with \ndisabilities a better education.\n  It was an extraordinary legislative achievement, one that had even \ngreater implications in terms of setting a moral baseline imperative \nthat we must meet the needs of those who live difficult lives. Jim has \nworked, not for the well-heeled or the heavy-hitting lobbysist--he has \ntirelessly worked for the people who truly need help.\n  I have also been proud to serve with Jim on the Senate Veterans' \nAffairs Committee. He has been an important voice in calling for \ncompassionate care for our veterans, especially those veterans \nreturning from Afghanistan and Iraq.\n  We both have States with a very high number of soldiers and veterans, \nand we both know how important it is for our soldiers and veterans to \nhave the health care they have earned and deserve. The two of us have \nbeen allies in pushing for greater funding and resources to help our \nsoldiers with PTSD, and I know that Jim is justifiably proud of the \nresearch and work by Vermont's White River Junction to help veterans \nstruggling with PTSD.\n  Jim Jeffords has never sought the limelight--he has sought results. \nHe\n\n[[Page S10232]]\n\nhas always done his work in the words of Shakespeare, with the modest \nstillness and humility that becomes any human. But when one looks back \nat his record, you can see that the modest man from Shrewsbury, VT, has \nleft his mark on virtually every piece of education, job training, and \ndisability legislation over the past quarter century. It is difficult \nto determine how many people Jim's efforts have helped, but if it were \npossible to quantify his efforts, I know we would find that hundreds of \nthousands of lives have been improved because of his actions in Vermont \nand across the country.\n  The Senate this year is losing a treasure, a man who in the best \ntradition of the Senate has never been afraid of taking heroic, \nprincipled stand without having to make a lot of noise. Sharon and I \nare personally losing good friends in Jim and his wife Liz. And \nAmericans all over the country are losing one of the most dedicated \nfighters for the basic rights that too many disadvantaged people are \nshortchanged on. I wish my friend well in his retirement.\n  I close with the sadness of losing in our body somebody such as \nSenator Jeffords. People go to him. People are comforted by his \npresence. People are emboldened by his nature. They see what it is he \ndoes not say to promote himself or his ideas, and somehow they are \nattracted to those ideas because they understand if it comes out of Jim \nJeffords, it is good for the public.\n  So I think of his family too, I say to Senator Boxer, and I think of \nhow proud they must be. I also think of just myself, to be honest, how \nsad I am going to be not being able to sit next to Jim Jeffords and \nshare his humor and to look upon his greatness--not just his nose, but \nhis greatness: the classic Vermonter, the classic New Englander. He has \nbeen so incredibly good for the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge the \nextraordinary career of Senator Jim Jeffords.\n  For the past 32 years, Jim Jeffords has served the citizens of \nVermont and the American people with integrity, intellectual honesty, \nand diligence. When faced with the choice between political convenience \nor protecting the interests of his constituents, Jim Jeffords always \nstood for Vermont and the concerns of hard-working Americans. When \nothers decided to do what was popular in Washington or among the \nchattering classes, Jim remained true to his values. He has been a \nmodel of principled leadership, often ahead of his time.\n  Long before protecting our environment and precious natural resources \noccupied America's consciousness, Jim was leading on these issues. \nWorking across party lines throughout his career, including as chairman \nof the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, Jim Jeffords \nurged the President to strengthen antipollution measures, investigated \nthe effects of greenhouse gas emissions, and promoted increased fuel \nefficiency. During his time in the U.S. Senate he introduced the Global \nWarming Pollution Reduction Act, the High-Performance Green Buildings \nAct, and the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Investment Act.\n  Jim Jeffords has never lost sight of his constituents and their \nneeds. He loyally stood by farmers in Vermont and all over the Nation \nwhen he fought President Bush's dairy tax, extended the Milk Income \nLoss Contracts--MILC--program, and supported the Farm Security and \nRural Investment Act.\n  Jim Jeffords has also committed his career to improving education, \nwhich he has treated as one of the great callings of our time. Speaking \nat a Rally for Education in 2002, Jim Jeffords said of education \nfunding that ``it is not an option, it is a necessity, for our \nchildren, for our schools and for the future of our great Nation.'' Jim \nJeffords championed the Head Start Program, increased funding for \nelementary, secondary, and higher education, and sponsored the Better \nEducation for Students and Teachers Act. He has also provided \nunwavering support to American children with disabilities that face a \nunique set of challenges in navigating our education system. Even as a \nfreshman Congressman some 30 years ago, Jim Jeffords managed to marshal \nhis colleagues in order to pass the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act.\n  As a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, I have had \nthe opportunity to work closely with Senator Jeffords and his capable \nstaff. His office and his standards of professionalism inspire great \nrespect.\n  On a personal level, I continue to admire a public servant that has \nso consistently followed his conscience. Time magazine recognized Jim \nJeffords as the ``Person of the Week'' for his ``revolutionary'' party \nswitch in 2001. I do not believe that Jim necessarily set out to start \na revolution; rather he invoked what might be considered a \nrevolutionary idea to some in Washington: government ought to serve the \nconcerns and interests of ordinary Americans instead of catering to \nfringe groups or election year antics. In hindsight, most will hail Jim \nJeffords' principled decision to switch parties, though I know the \ndecision was a difficult one for him and strained his relationship with \nmany in this body. But Jim Jeffords did what he thought was right, and \nI applaud his courage and his example of leadership.\n  So I thank Senator Jeffords not only for his lifetime of service and \naccomplishments but for having raised the bar for all of us.\n  I wish Jim Jeffords and his family many happy years ahead.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their very \ngenerous and kind comments. Their remarks remind me--all of us--the \nSenate is a family. I also thank my colleagues for their friendship. I \nam honored to be able to serve with you, especially you, I say to \nSenator Rockefeller.\n  You have been very kind to me over the years. I have followed your \nguidance, and it has been good. I thank all of my colleagues for their \nfriendship and am honored to serve with you. And as I go forward--I \ndon't know--I am going to wonder why I am going forward and not just \nstaying with you.\n  Mr. President, now I guess we should proceed with the process that is \nnormal. I thank the leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am pleased to be able to advise the \nSenate that the Appropriations Committee has completed our work on the \nbill providing funds for the Department of Homeland Security and the \nDepartment of Defense for the next fiscal year which begins on October \n1.\n  Yesterday, the other body approved the Defense appropriations \nconference report, which provides new spending authority for the \nDepartment of Defense. Included in this bill is $70 billion in \nadditional appropriations to fund operations related to the global war \non terror. I expect the majority leader will call up this conference \nreport later today for approval by the Senate.\n  I commend the excellent leadership and hard work of the distinguished \nSenators from Alaska and Hawaii, the chairman of the Defense \nAppropriations Subcommittee and the ranking Democrat on that \nsubcommittee, for putting together a bill that carefully considers the \nrequests made by the administration for this massive undertaking of \ndefending our country, identifying the challenges that we face, which \nthreaten our security at home and abroad. It is a daunting task, but \nthey have brought to this challenge a lot of experience, a lot of keen \ninsight into the needs of our country, and the way the Department has \nto receive funding on a predictable and regular basis to achieve its \ngoals and carry out its important mission.\n  It is also my hope that the Homeland Security conference report will \nsoon be filed in the House. It includes $34.8 billion in discretionary \nspending. It also reflects hard work by the conferees on that \nsubcommittee, the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. Gregg, \nand the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd, who were \nthe chairman and ranking minority member of that subcommittee. Our \nconferees completed work on this bill, and we expect that it will be \nfiled in the House, as I have suggested, I hope, very soon.\n\n[[Page S10233]]\n\n  The Homeland Security appropriations bill for fiscal year 2007 \nappropriates $1.8 billion, designated as emergency funding for border \nsecurity, to help make our borders more secure. I commend the President \nand the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security for their \nleadership and their efforts to help strengthen the capability of \nprotecting our homeland. Four thousand new border agents have been \nadded. Detention facilities have been constructed. Cargo inspection has \nbeen improved. Coast Guard equipment and capabilities have been \nupgraded and modernized. New vehicles for agents have been acquired. \nNew technologies have been acquired, as well, to help control illegal \nimmigration. The capacity to detect weapons of mass destruction have \nbeen improved.\n  The timely consideration of both of these appropriations conference \nreports is very important to our Nation's security. The bills provide \nthe funding to protect our Nation from those who would threaten us.\n  I commend the conferees and the staff members who worked very hard to \ncomplete our work on these bills. I appreciate President Bush's \nleadership in sending the requests to Congress that were comprehensive, \nvery carefully considered. I applaud the leadership of the \nadministration for successfully protecting our homeland.\n  Protecting our homeland is a huge challenge. Every year there are \nover 500 million people who cross our borders. There are 118 million \nvehicles and 16 million cargo containers that enter the United States \nannually. We have 95,000 miles of coastlines, 2,000 miles of common \nborder with Mexico, and 5,000 miles of common border with Canada. These \nare under the jurisdiction of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the \nTransportation Security Administration, and the Coast Guard.\n  While efforts are being made at home to protect ourselves and our \nborders, demanding work is being done abroad by our military forces to \ndefeat the terrorists. They have expressed their intention to kill \nAmericans and anyone who stands in their way.\n  The Defense appropriations bill fully funds military pay for our \ntroops and includes an across-the-board pay raise that was requested by \nthe President, as well as procurement of necessary aircraft, ships, and \nground equipment to ensure that our military forces are the best in the \nworld.\n  The Defense appropriations bill contains $70 billion of supplemental \nfunding to ensure that our troops have the resources needed to succeed \nin the global war on terrorism.\n  Mr. President, I commend the good work of our conferees, and I am \nhopeful that both conference reports will be passed by the Senate this \nweek. It will permit the timely transition to the new fiscal year and \nprevent potential funding delays that could result in a disruption of \nprograms that are very important to our national security.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, there has been so much in the news \nsince last Sunday regarding parts of a National Intelligence Estimate \nthat was put out in a major American newspaper. The leaked report has \nbeen the subject of much discussion, supposedly saying that the war in \nIraq is hurting the chances of our stopping the terrorist attacks on \nourselves and other freedom-loving nations.\n  Yesterday, the President said he believed it was very important, \nrather than just having the leaked portions of the National \nIntelligence Estimate available to the public, to have the whole \ndocument be out in the public forum. Within a matter of hours, the \nPresident declassified the Key Judgments of the National Intelligence \nEstimate so that everyone in America--and indeed in the world--would be \nable to see the full text of the Key Judgments, which was an internal, \nclassified document that was meant to assess the threats, the global \nthreats from terrorists to ourselves and other western nations, or \nother democracies around the world.\n  I think it is so important that we get the full report out there. The \nKey Judgments are on the Web for everyone to see. Anyone with a \ncomputer or a FAX machine can get these Key Judgments. I think what it \ndoes is show, clearly, that what the President is trying to do, and \nwhat our strategy in America is, is the right one; that is, that we \nmust continue to pursue the terrorists without equivocation, without a \nlessening in commitment, without any hesitancy. We must go after these \nterrorists, who are inhuman, who have no standards of any moral \nframework, and we must not be diffident in our efforts to wipe them out \nbefore they attack Americans and other freedom-loving people in the \nworld--indeed, innocent women, children, and men who are being \nslaughtered daily with suicide bombs and kidnappings and beheadings.\n  Secondly, the major point that the President is trying to make--and \nmost of us in Congress agree with--is that we need to have a very long \nterm commitment to help bring freedom to the people who are living \nunder the regimes that treat women as if they are subhuman, that treat \ntheir own people who might be of a different sect as if they are lesser \npeople, or because I am a Sunni and you are a Shiite, or I am a Kurd \nand you are a Sunni--any of those combinations. They are treating each \nother with the same violence, and inhumane treatment as they do with \nAmericans.\n  Mr. President, I think if you look at the entire report, you will see \nthat the strategy of cut and run is not the way to wipe out the \nterrorists. The President's strategy is not to treat terrorists with \nkid gloves. The President's strategy is to go on the offensive to bring \nterrorists to justice. The President's strategy is to also work with \nthe innocent people in the Middle East so they can have freedom, they \ncan have democracy, they can have a quality of life that would make \ntheir children want to live, rather than blow themselves up in order to \nkill innocent people. And it is to confront the terrorists with the \nsame determination that they bring to their assault on freedom. We must \ntreat them with absolute clarity--that we will not give up the defense \nof freedom and be dictated to by people who do not even treat their own \npeople with humanity, and who treat women as if they are not human \nbeings.\n  Mr. President, I want to talk about some specific parts of the \nreport. I want to put in the Record some of the significant Key \nJudgments that I have not seen reported in the press. Here are some of \nthe key parts of the report under the ``Key Judgments'' section of the \nNational Intelligence Estimate:\n\n       United States-led counterterrorism efforts have seriously \n     damaged the leadership of al-Qaida and disrupted its \n     operations; however, we judge that al-Qaida will continue to \n     pose the greatest threat to the Homeland and U.S. interests \n     abroad by a single terrorist organization. We also assess \n     that the global jihadist movement . . . is spreading and \n     adapting to counterterrorism efforts.\n       Greater pluralism and more responsive political systems in \n     Muslim majority nations would alleviate some of the \n     grievances jihadists exploit. Over time, such progress, \n     together with sustained, multifaceted programs targeting the \n     vulnerabilities of the jihadist movement and continued \n     pressure on al-Qa'ida could erode support for the jihadists.\n\n  That is saying in the internal document that pursuing democracies, \nfreedom, and self-governance is one of the ways that we will be able to \neventually erode the al-Qaida terrorist network and other terrorist \nnetworks with which we are not even yet familiar. So it is verifying \nthat education and the attempt to bring self-governance to the Middle \nEastern countries that do not have it is the right approach.\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       We assess that the global jihadist movement is \n     decentralized, lacks a coherent global strategy, and is \n     becoming more diffused. New jihadist networks and cells, with \n     anti-American agendas, are . . . likely to emerge. . . .\n       We assess that the operational threat from self-radicalized \n     cells will grow in importance\n\n[[Page S10234]]\n\n     to U.S. counterterrorism efforts, particularly abroad but \n     also in the Homeland.\n       The jihadists regard Europe as an important venue for \n     attacking Western interests. Extremist networks inside the \n     extensive Muslim diasporas in Europe facilitate recruitment \n     and staging for urban attacks, as illustrated in the 2004 \n     Madrid bombings and the 2005 London bombings.\n\n  The report goes on to say:\n\n       We assess that the Iraq jihad is shaping a new generation \n     of terrorist leaders and operatives; perceived jihadist \n     success there--\n\n  In Iraq--\n\n       would inspire more fighters to continue the struggle \n     elsewhere.\n       The Iraq conflict has become the ``cause celebre'' for \n     jihadists, breeding a deep resentment of U.S. involvement in \n     the Muslim world. . . . Should jihadists leaving Iraq \n     perceive themselves, and be perceived, to have failed, we \n     judge fewer fighters will be inspired to carry on the fight.\n\n  Let me reemphasize what they are saying in their estimate. Should the \nterrorists be perceived as failing, they would have fewer recruits for \ntheir continued terrorist activities.\n  The report goes on to say:\n\n       Concomitant vulnerabilities in the jihadist movement have \n     emerged that, if fully exposed and exploited, could begin to \n     slow the spread of the movement. They include dependence on \n     the continuation of Muslim-related conflicts, the limited \n     appeal of the jihadists' radical ideology, the emergence of \n     respected voices of moderation, and criticism of the violent \n     tactics employed against mostly Muslim citizens.\n       The jihadists' greatest vulnerability is that their \n     ultimate political solution--an ultra-conservative \n     interpretation of shari'a-based governance spanning the \n     Muslim world--is unpopular with the vast majority of Muslims. \n     Exposing the religious and political straitjacket that is \n     implied by the jihadists' propaganda would help to divide \n     them from the audiences they seek to persuade.\n       Recent condemnations of violence and extremist religious \n     interpretations by a few notable Muslim clerics signal a \n     trend that could facilitate the growth of a constructive \n     alternative to jihadist ideology: peaceful political \n     activism.\n\n  That is exactly what the strategy of the United States has been. It \nis not a strategy that can be pursued on a short-term basis. Education \nand enlightenment is a very long-term strategy and the Muslim clerics \nnow stepping up to denounce violence against other Muslims is exactly \nwhat we are seeing emerge. As this National Intelligence Estimate has \nrevealed these developments are the beginning of how we can make a \ndifference.\n  The report goes on to say:\n\n       If democratic reform efforts in Muslim majority nations \n     progress over the next five years, political participation \n     probably would drive a wedge between intransigent extremists \n     and groups willing to use the political process to achieve \n     their local objectives.\n\n  I did not read all of the Key Judgments into the Record. I did read \nexcerpts because I think the strategy of America today is a strategy \nthat is being borne out by the report, which is the opposite of what \nthe leaks purported to say; that our efforts in Iraq are undermining \nthe Global War on Terrorism. When in fact, with regard to the situation \nin Iraq, it is actually essential for us to win in order to keep our \ncommitment, in order to show that America will stand strong when the \ntimes are tough, and they are tough. To show that we will stand against \nthese terrorists is the most important thing we can do, and that is our \nstrategy.\n  We should not be undercut by leaks that will undermine that strategy. \nWe must be united as a Congress, as the President is trying to do, in \nsaying that we must do the right thing, we must keep our commitments, \nwe cannot cut and run because times are tough. We must admit that times \nare tough. We must admit that this has been one of the most difficult \ntimes in our history. But we must continue to be vigilant because, \naccording to the report, if we are perceived as weak, if we are \nperceived as leaving because we are defeated rather than leaving after \nwe have kept our word and are the victors in freeing the Iraqi people \nto have self-governance, then the jihadists, the terrorists, the \nnetworks, about which we don't even know yet, will be emboldened to \ncome forward and hurt Americans in our homeland, as well as wherever \nthey see a perceived weakness in the defenses of the people.\n  I think the President of the United States did the right thing \nyesterday by immediately declassifying this document because if people \nwill take the time to read it in its totality, people will see that it \nverifies the strategy in the short term of standing firm against these \nterrorists to show that we will not buckle, we will not cut and run, we \nwill not be divided as a nation in our commitment to freedom and \npreservation of our society, and the long-term strategy of taking the \ntime and the patience and the effort to work with the Muslim clerics \nand the Muslim leaders who are willing to stand up, who are willing to \nrisk their lives for the future of their civilization and say violence \nagainst Muslims or other people who have not harmed us is wrong.\n  That is what we are doing, and it is the right strategy.\n  The President has had the current strategy against terrorism verified \nby the National Intelligence Estimate. Unfortunately, the National \nIntelligence Estimate was partially leaked last week but not in its \nfull context. In the full context, we see the verification of the \nstrategy, and we cannot relent. We know these terrorists want to spread \nterrorism and harsh, violent, inhuman regimes wherever they can get a \nfoothold. It is the hope of peace and freedom and humanity that America \nand our allies carry to the battle. It is a battle, it is a war. It is \nevery bit as much a fight for freedom as any war in which America has \nbeen involved.\n  This is a war we cannot lose. We have stopped communism from taking \nover the world. We have stopped socialism from taking over the world. \nWe cannot allow terrorists to take over the world if we are worth \nanything as leaders in this country. The President of the United States \nis resolute on this issue. Congress must stand with him. We must not \nallow selective leaks of internal intelligence advisories to be \nmisconstrued to say that vigilance against terrorism is a losing \nproposition.\n  I hope we can bring America together to speak with one voice. I hope \nwe can bring America together to stay the very long term course that we \nmust pursue in order to have the opportunities for our children that we \nhave had, to grow up in the greatest country on Earth. That is our \nresponsibility. We are the leaders of this country, and if we cannot \nprotect freedom for our children, if we cannot protect the \nopportunities for them that we have had, we are not worthy. I think we \nare worthy, I think the President is worthy, and I think it is our \nresponsibility to stand strong and to point out the facts where the \nfacts have not been pointed out.\n  That is exactly what I intend to do. That is what the President \nintends to do. It is my hope that we do not have a divided Congress \nbehind him but instead a united Congress with a united people to say to \nthe terrorists who would break down the freedom we have built for over \n200 years and the beacon of freedom that we are to the world: We will \nstand, we will not run, we will not be lackluster in our commitment. We \ndo not have a 30-minute attention span in this country. We have a \nmemory, and that memory will never let terrorists take away our \nfreedom, nor will it allow us to walk away from our responsibility to \nthe future generations of America.\n  We stand on the shoulders of giants who have protected freedom in \nthis country. We cannot let the American people down, and we will not.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. GRAHAM). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/27/senate-section/article/S10234-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10234-S10238]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MILITARY COMMISSIONS ACT OF 2006\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the Military \nCommissions Act of 2006 which the Senate is likely to consider, \npossibly today, certainly this week.\n  For those who have been following it, the debate in Washington the \nlast few weeks has been very interesting. It has now been 5 years since \nthe attacks of 9/11. The present administration has finally come \nforward and asked Congress\n\n[[Page S10235]]\n\nto pass a bill authorizing military trials to try suspected terrorists. \nAt this late date, the President is demanding the Congress act \nimmediately after the administration waited 5 years to come to \nCongress.\n  It is welcome news that the President is now working with the \nCongress to bring the planners of 9/11 to justice. Why do we have to do \nit today? Why do we have to do it this week?\n  For some of us who have served in the Senate for a while, this \nreminds us of a debate that took place 4 years ago. Four years ago this \nCongress was told that before we could return home to face the November \nelections, we absolutely without fail had to vote on the question of \nauthorizing the use of military force and giving the President the \nauthority to invade Iraq. We were told there was a timetable that had \nto be met; that there was no time to spare.\n  Despite the fact that we had limited information about the situation \nin Iraq, despite the fact that we had only vague assurances from the \nPresident that he would use diplomacy before he ever considered \nmilitary action, despite the fact that we didn't have a coalition of \nallies or forces, we were told the decision had to be made. It had to \nbe made in October, before an election.\n  I recall it very well because I was up for reelection. Many of us \nwere told: If you vote wrong on this one, you may not be reelected. It \nwasn't an easy vote. The toughest vote any Member of Congress can face \nis a vote for going to war. On that vote there were 23 Members of \nCongress who voted no--1 Republican, 22 Democrats--and I was one of \nthat number. I look back on it now as the right vote. I have heard many \nSenators who voted to go to war that day who have said: We made a \nmistake.\n  I salute their courage for standing up and admitting that. I have yet \nto find a single Senator who voted against that war who has said the \nsame.\n\n  Now we are being told, less than 2 months before another election, we \nabsolutely have to have a vote this week on a--secure fence, they call \nit. See if you can catch the flaw in the logic.\n  The proposal is to build a 700-mile fence on the Mexican border, \nwhich is 2,000 miles long. Do you catch the flaw in this logic? Is it \npossible that those determined to come into the United States might go \naround the fence? Over it? Under it? This 700-mile fence is a 19th or \nearly 20th century answer to a 21st century challenge. It has now \nbecome a question of political bragging rights. Which party has the \nlongest fence to take to the American voters? Is that the best we can \ndo on Capitol Hill?\n  I might add, this underlying bill says it is about time we get \nserious about building a fence between Canada and the United States--\nthousands of miles. I try to envision this, what we are talking about. \nThe 700-mile fence on the southern border is the equivalent of a fence \nfrom the Washington Monument in the Nation's Capitol to the Sears Tower \nin Chicago--a fence of 700 miles.\n  We can argue the merits or demerits of this issue, but it is clear \nwhat it is all about. It is an effort to have a political vote as close \nto the election as possible. It is an effort to tap into voter \nsentiment on the issue of immigration. It is an effort to avoid our \nreal responsibility, and that is to demand smart enforcement--tough \nenforcement at the border, and enforcement in the workplace so that \nthose who are drawn to America to find a job will be discouraged \nbecause now there will be a tamper-proof ID to establish who a person \nreally is before they have a chance to work in this country.\n  It is also ignoring the obvious, too. We need agricultural workers \nimmediately. The crops, the fruit and produce, are rotting right now in \nmany States such as California because the workers are not permitted to \ncome here. That is not good for the growers, of course. It is certainly \nnot good for America. But it is a fact.\n  We also face another reality. There are 10 to 12 million people here \ntoday who are undocumented. I know many of them in my city of Chicago, \nwhich I am honored to represent. Many come forward to talk about the \nchallenges they face with current immigration laws, which are almost \nimpossible to understand. Instead of looking at the whole picture and \nhaving an honest answer, even if it isn't that popular, the Republican \nleadership has decided that before we get out of town we are going to \nvote on a 700-mile fence, on the Mexican border and a study of a fence \nalong the Canadian border. It tells you where we are politically.\n  The second part of this bill is not much different. It is an effort, \nI am afraid, by many political strategists, to create a political wedge \nissue, a replay of what we faced 4 years ago with the vote on \nauthorizing the President to invade Iraq. The reality is that the \nCongress has stood ready to create commissions to try terrorists for a \nlong time. It was 2002, when Senator Arlen Specter, Republican of \nPennsylvania, now chairman of the Judiciary Committee, came to me and \nasked me to cosponsor bipartisan legislation to authorize military \ncommissions, and I did. The understanding was we should have \ncommissions that are consistent with the rule of law and our \nconstitutional values. That was 4 years ago. Nothing has happened, from \nthe administration or in Congress. Now we are told we can't wait \nanother day.\n  Instead of working with Congress, the President unilaterally created \nmilitary commissions that are inconsistent with American values and the \nlaw. It was no surprise when the Supreme Court ruled in the Hamdan \ndecision this administration's military commissions were illegal.\n  After the Hamdan decision, I had hoped that we could work with the \nadministration by charting a new course, a bipartisan course, as we did \nwith so many other things. When it came to the creation of the PATRIOT \nAct, it was a bipartisan effort after 9/11. When it came to reforming \nour intelligence agency, it was bipartisan. But, unfortunately, this \neffort has not been bipartisan. Instead, the Administration initially \ndemanded that Congress pass a law simply ratifying the approach that \nthe Supreme Court has already rejected. The Republican leadership of \nCongress rushed to rubberstamp the President's proposal.\n  We need to create military commissions so those who are guilty of \nterrorism and war crimes can be held accountable. But we need to do it \nin a way that will meet the test of the body right across the street, \nthe U.S. Supreme Court. They will ultimately look at our product and \ndecide whether it meets constitutional muster. If the Court rejects \nthese new military commissions, justice for the victims of 9/11 will be \ndelayed yet again.\n\n  It is fortunate that under the leadership of Chairman John Warner and \nranking member Carl Levin, the Senate Armed Services Committee took a \nhard look at this issue and produced bipartisan legislation that is \nvastly superior to the bill proposed by the administration. It is \ndisappointing, but not surprising, that the White House and Republican \nleadership of the Senate did not accept the Armed Services Committee \nbill. I am afraid that was our last best hope for a bipartisan effort. \nBut perhaps many of them do not want a bipartisan bill. Many of those \nstrategists want a partisan issue.\n  It is more important that the protection of America be done on a \nbipartisan basis and a sensible basis than that we posture in these \nlast few moments before an election to try to win some advantage in the \npolls.\n  I want to salute a number of Republican Senators, one of whom is \npresiding at this moment, for their leadership on this issue: Senator \nJohn Warner of Virginia, Senator John McCain of Arizona, and Senator \nLindsey Graham of South Carolina, who is presiding. Senator Warner is a \nWorld War II vet and former Secretary of the Navy; John McCain, \nVietnam, a Vietnam vet, former prisoner of war; Lindsey Graham, who was \na judge advocate in the Air Force Reserves and is the only Senator \ncurrently serving in the National Guard or Reserves.\n  They spoke out, and I am sure they took some heat for saying the \nadministration's proposal was not good enough. The chorus behind them \nwas a strong one. General Colin Powell stepped forward and said the \nadministration's proposal did not meet the moral test of a country that \nwants to fight terrorism on a global basis. He was joined by General \nVessey and General Shalikashvili and other military leaders who were \nequally critical.\n  Thanks to their efforts, the bill we will consider is better than it \notherwise would have been. For example, the bill would make it a crime \nto use abusive interrogation techniques like\n\n[[Page S10236]]\n\nwaterboarding, induced hypothermia, painful stress positions, and \nprolonged sleep deprivation.\n  What it comes down to is this: How will we treat detainees and \nprisoners? Is there a limit to what we can or should do? Will the \nGeneva Conventions work? This administration, the Bush administration, \nsaid a few years ago they were quaint and obsolete in a war against \nterrorism. Thank goodness that point of view is no longer acceptable.\n  President Bush says he has one test for this legislation: Will it \nallow the administration's secret prisons and coercive interrogation \ntechniques to continue?\n  Of course we must detain and aggressively interrogate suspected \nterrorists. We live in a dangerous world. There are people in this \nworld who wish us ill. We learned it on 9/11. We learned it in \ncountries around the world, that these are people who cannot be trifled \nwith. They must be taken seriously, and I would not support any \nlegislation that prevented our military or intelligence investigators \nfrom asking the hard questions of those they have detained.\n  But there are other tests we have to apply as well. First, is the \nlegislation we are about to pass consistent with American values and \nlaw? What makes us better than the terrorists is that there are some \nlines we won't cross, even in war. I believe we can fight terrorism \neffectively and stay true to our Constitution.\n  Just as important: Will this legislation put our own troops at risk \nor make it more difficult to fight the war on terror. As dozens of \nmilitary leaders have argued in recent weeks, this is not the last war \nwe will fight, and the standards we set today for the treatment of \ndetainees and prisoners will determine how our brave soldiers will be \ntreated in this and future wars.\n  Despite the great efforts of Senators Warner, McCain, and Graham, I \nam concerned that provisions in the bill that will come before us do \nnot meet these tests.\n  Let's take one example. The bill would revise a law known as the War \nCrimes Act to give Bush administration officials and those who preceded \nthem, back to 1997, amnesty, amnesty for authorizing illegal \ninterrogation techniques.\n\n  Think about this for a second. This administration wrote a memo. The \nauthor of that memo is a gentleman who is now before us as a potential \nnominee for the Federal court. In that memo it was recommended that we \nmight use, as part of interrogation techniques, using dogs to threaten \nand intimidate prisoners. That was in the memo.\n  Now, fast forward to Abu Ghraib and to those awful, horrific \nphotographs we saw of the treatment of prisoners in that jail. You will \nrecall, as I do, one of our soldiers holding on a leash a dog that was \ngrowling at one of the prisoners. That soldier is in jail today for \nusing that dog and using that technique. The person who wrote the memo \nsuggesting the use of dogs as an interrogation technique is not only \nfacing no questioning, but the administration is proposing he be given \na lifetime appointment to the second highest court in the land.\n  Where is the justice, when soldiers who use these techniques, as \nwrong as they are, end up in prison, and those who write the memos \nsuggesting these techniques not only are not held accountable, they are \nrewarded? And now we are presented with this bill, which says we will \ngive amnesty to those who conceived of these interrogation techniques.\n  Over 4 years ago, then-White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales \nrecommended to the President that the Geneva Convention should not \napply to the war on terrorism. In a January 2002 memo to the President, \nMr. Gonzales concluded the war on terrorism ``renders obsolete'' the \nGeneva Conventions. Think of that. The Geneva Conventions, \ninternational agreements that have guided America for more than a \ncentury, were obsolete, we were told by the White House Counsel at that \ntime, Mr. Gonzales.\n  In his memo to President Bush, Mr. Gonzales specifically warned that \nadministration officials could be prosecuted under the War Crimes Act \nif the President did not set aside the Geneva Conventions. He argued \nthat a presidential determination that the Geneva Conventions do not \napply would ``substantially reduce the threat of domestic criminal \nprosecution under the War Crimes Act'' and ``would provide a solid \ndefense to any future prosecution.''\n  It was during that period of redefining conduct that some terrible \nmemos and terrible standards were generated by this administration, \nstandards which led to some of our soldiers being imprisoned. Now this \nbill would say that the authors of those terrible standards cannot be \nheld accountable.\n  General Colin Powell, who was Secretary of State at the time, \nstrongly disagreed with the recommendation to set aside the Geneva \nConventions. He had decades of military experience informing his \njudgment. He argued that complying with the Geneva Conventions and \neffectively fighting the war on terrorism were not only possible, it \nwas the course America should follow. In a memo to Mr. Gonzales, \nSecretary Colin Powell concluded that setting aside the Geneva \nConventions:\n\n        . . . will reverse over a century of U.S. policy and \n     practice in supporting the Geneva conventions and undermine \n     the protections of the law of war for our own troops.\n\n  General Powell said:\n\n       It will undermine public support among critical allies, \n     making military cooperation more difficult to sustain.\n\n  Now look at what happened in the 4 years that followed. From \nWashington DC, to Guantanamo, to Abu Ghraib, damage has been done to \nAmerica's image. It is clear that Secretary Colin Powell was right. \nUnfortunately, the President rejected his wise counsel. In February \n2002 the President issued a memo directing that the Geneva Conventions \nwould not apply to the war on terrorism.\n  Just this summer, in the Hamdan case, the Supreme Court ruled that \nthe President's position on the Geneva Conventions is illegal. The \nSupreme Court reminded the President and all of us that we are a nation \nof laws, even in a time of war.\n  Now, 4 years after Gonzales warned President Bush about possible \nprosecutions under the War Crimes Act, the administration wants an \namnesty, retroactive immunity for their actions. According to a recent \nWashington Post story, Alberto Gonzales told Republican Members of \nCongress:\n\n        . . . a shield is needed for actions taken by \n     U.S. personnel under a 2002 Presidential order which the \n     Supreme Court declared illegal.\n\n  One reason the White House may be pushing for amnesty is because \nhigh-ranking administration officials have authorized the use of \nseveral controversial interrogation techniques that appear to violate \nthe law. In late 2002, relying on the President's decision to set aside \nthe Geneva Conventions, Defense Secretary Rumsfeld approved numerous \ninterrogation tactics for use at Guantanamo. The commander of \nGuantanamo Bay's detention operations gave the Guantanamo policies to \nsenior officers in Iraq, and they became the bedrock for interrogation \ntactics in Iraq, according to the Department of Defense's own \ninvestigation. The horrible images that emerged from Abu Ghraib have \nseared into our mind the nature of some of these techniques, including \nthreatening detainees with dogs and forcing detainees into painful \nstress positions for long periods of time.\n  When other countries have used these techniques throughout modern \nhistory, the United States, through our State Department, has condemned \nthem as torture. In a memo that has been publicly released, the Federal \nBureau of Investigation concluded that the techniques authorized by the \nDefense Secretary but ``are not permitted by the U.S. Constitution.''\n  Senior military lawyers, known as Judge Advocates General, have also \nraised serious concerns. To take just one example, in a recent hearing \nof the Senate Armed Services Committee, MG Jack Rives, the Air Force \nJAG, said ``some of the techniques that have been authorized and used \nin the past have violated Common Article 3'' of the Geneva Conventions.\n  These are not human rights groups, partisans, or journalists. This is \nour own State Department, our FBI, and military lawyers saying the \nadministration has authorized interrogation techniques that violate the \nlaw.\n  And who will accept responsibility for these mistakes? The soldiers. \nThe soldiers will go to jail. But if this bill\n\n[[Page S10237]]\n\npasses, those who sent out the memos will be off the hook. So while the \nadministration claims they want to do right by the victims of 9/11 and \nour brave men and women in uniform, it appears that they are not doing \nwhat justice requires.\n  This amnesty will protect someone else. Sadly, it will also protect \nthose who commit war crimes against Americans. Let's not forget the \noriginal intent of the War Crimes Act, enacted in 1996 by a Republican-\ncontrolled Congress, adopted by a voice vote in the House and a \nunanimous vote in the Senate. Conservative Republican Congressman \nWalter Jones proposed it after he met with a retired Navy pilot who \nspent 6 years in the Hanoi Hilton, the same Vietnamese prison where \nSenator John McCain was detained.\n  Congressman Jones wanted to give the Justice Department the authority \nto prosecute war criminals like the Vietcong who abused American POWs.\n  Here is what Senator Jesse Helms, a leading conservative on the \nRepublican side of the aisle, said of the War Crimes Act:\n\n       This bill will help to close major gaps in our Federal \n     criminal law by permitting American servicemen and nationals, \n     who were victims of war crimes, to see the criminals brought \n     to justice in the United States.\n\n  So keep in mind that if we water down the War Crimes Act to immunize \nAmerican government officials, we also make it harder to prosecute war \ncriminals who abuse Americans.\n  There is another very troubling provision in this legislation. It \nwould eliminate the writ of habeas corpus for detainees. Habeas corpus \nis a Latin phrase that means ``you have the body.'' It is the name for \nthe procedure that allows a prisoner to challenge his detention.\n  Over 700 lawyers from Chicago sent me a letter strongly opposing the \nelimination of habeas corpus for detainees. Here is how they explained \nthe importance of habeas corpus:\n\n       The right of habeas corpus was enshrined in the \n     Constitution by our Founding Fathers as the means by which \n     anyone who is detained by the Executive may challenge the \n     lawfulness of his detention. It is a vital part of our system \n     of ``checks and balances'' and an important safeguard against \n     mistakes which can be made even by the best intentional \n     government officials.\n\n  To a nonlawyer, habeas corpus may sound like an abstract legal \nprinciple, but eliminating it would have practical and very damaging \nconsequences: it would prevent courts from reviewing the lawfulness of \nthe administration's detention and interrogation practices. This is yet \nanother form of amnesty for the administration.\n  Why is the administration so interested in protecting itself from \njudicial review?\n  Perhaps it is because the courts have repeatedly ruled that the \nadministration's policies violate the law.\n  After the September 11 terrorist attacks, the administration \nunilaterally created a new detention policy which applies to many \nhundreds who have been held in detention, some for years. The \nadministration claimed the right to seize anyone, including an American \ncitizen in the United States, and to hold him until the end of the war \non terrorism, whenever that may be.\n  They claimed than even an American citizen who is detained has no \nrights. That means no right to challenge his detention, no right to see \nthe evidence against him, and no right even to know why he is being \nheld. In fact, an administration lawyer claimed in court that detainees \nwould have no right to challenge their detentions even if they were \nbeing tortured or summarily executed.\n  Using their new detention policy, the administration has detained \nthousands of individuals in secret detention centers around the world. \nWhile it is the most well-known, Guantanamo Bay is only one of these \ndetention centers. Many have been captured in Afghanistan and Iraq, but \npeople who never raised arms against us have been taken prisoner far \nfrom the battlefield, in places like Bosnia and Thailand.\n  Who are the detainees in Guantanamo Bay? Back in 2002, Defense \nSecretary Rumsfeld described them as ``the hardest of the hard core'' \nand ``among the most dangerous, best trained, vicious killers on the \nface of the Earth.'' However, the administration has since released \nhundreds of the detainees and it now appears that Secretary Rumsfeld's \nassertion was false.\n  According to media reports, military sources indicate that many \ndetainees have no connection to al-Qaida or the Taliban and were sent \nto Guantanamo over the objections of intelligence personnel who \nrecommended they be released.\n  There have been all sorts of studies.\n  I recall visiting Guantanamo recently where Admiral Harry Harris said \nto me--I asked him about the prisoners there. He said, ``They are not \nbeing punished--they are only being detained.''\n  They haven't been charged with anything--and that is the point. \nHabeas corpus allows these people being held for years to ask why they \nare being held. They are not automatically released, but under habeas \ncorpus they can ask: On what basis are you keeping me as a prisoner?\n  I hope my colleagues will stop and think about this for a moment. If \nthere is a dangerous person in Guantanamo who threatens an American \nsoldier or any American citizens with an act of terrorism, if they have \nbeen complicit in any act of terrorism involving al-Qaida or Taliban, \nfrom my point of view they should be incarcerated and held until there \nis no danger to the United States. But if we are simply holding 455 \npeople with no charges, indefinitely, and no right to challenge the \nbasis for their detention, until this war on terrorism, which has no \ndefinable end to it, comes to an end, that is not consistent with the \nprinciple of justice.\n  In 2004, in the landmark decision of Rasul v. Bush, the Supreme Court \nrejected the administration's detention policy. The Court held that \ndetainees can file habeas corpus claims in court to ask why they are \nbeing detained.\n  Rather than changing their policies to comply with the Court's \ndecision, the administration has asked the Republican-controlled \nCongress to change the law to eliminate habeas corpus for detainees. \nThis would overturn the Court's decision in Rasul v. Bush and immunize \nthe administration's detention policies from judicial review.\n  Tom Sullivan is a prominent attorney in Chicago and a friend of mine. \nTom served in the Army during the Korean war. He is a former U.S. \nAttorney. On a pro bono basis, he and his law partner Jeff Colman have \ntaken on the cases of several Guantanamo detainees.\n  Tom says that his clients were not detained on the battlefield and \nthat they are not even accused of engaging in hostilities against the \nUnited States. He believes they are innocent and are in Guantanamo \nbecause of mistakes that were made in the fog of war. Tom has been a \nlawyer for more than 50 years. He believes habeas corpus is the bedrock \nof the American legal system because it is the only recourse available \nwhen the government has mistakenly detained an innocent person.\n  ADM John Hutson was a Navy judge advocate for 28 years. Admiral \nHutson testified yesterday at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing. \nHere is what he said about eliminating habeas for detainees:\n  It is inconsistent with our own history and tradition to take this \naction. If we diminish or tarnish our values, those values that the \nFounders fought for and memorialized in the Constitution and have been \ncarefully preserved by the blood and honor or succeeding generations, \nthen we will have lost a major battle in the war on terror . . . We \ndon't need to do this. America is too strong. Our system of justice is \ntoo sacred to tinker with in this way.\n  Admiral Hutson also testified that eliminating habeas will put our \nown troops at risk:\n\n       If we fail to provide a reasonable judicial avenue to \n     consider detention, other countries will fell justified in \n     doing the same thing. . . . It is U.S. troops who are forward \n     deployed in greater numbers and on more occasions than all \n     other nations combined. It is our troops who are in harm's \n     way and deserve judicial protections. In future wars, we will \n     want to ensure that our troops and those of our allies are \n     treated in a manner similar to how we treat our enemies. We \n     are now setting the standard for that treatment.\n\n  When I visited the detention facility at Guantanamo, I saw American \nsoldiers doing their duty in a very bleak and desolate spot. I salute \nthem for serving their country. Every day they wake up, put on the \nuniform of the United States and serve us with honor and distinction. \nCongress should not do anything to make their job more difficult.\n\n[[Page S10238]]\n\n  We should not have a double standard where our brave men and women in \nuniform go to jail and high-ranking political appointees are not held \naccountable. What kind of message does that send to our soldiers?\n  If we eliminate habeas corpus for detainees at Guantanamo, we will \nput our troops in the impossible position of serving as jailers for men \nwho are indefinitely detained with no ability to challenge their \ndetention.\n  Think about that for a moment. If there were an American employee or \nan American citizen or an American soldier being held in a foreign \nplace with no charges against them, indefinitely, with no recourse \nunder the law, we would be protesting in the strongest terms.\n  The American people want us to bring the planners of 9/11 to justice. \nThat should be the focus of our legislation, not giving amnesty to \nadministration officials and not immunizing the administration's \npolicies from judicial review.\n  These provisions fail two crucial tests. They are inconsistent with \nAmerican values, and they would put our troops at risk. They must be \nchanged.\n  I look forward to the consideration of this bill on the Senate floor \nwith amendments to be offered to make these changes so that we can come \nforward with a bipartisan bill, a bill that will make America safer but \nnot at the expense of our basic values.\n  I yield the floor.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Domenici pertaining to the introduction of S. \n3962 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

If I could speak on this very important issue addressed \npreviously by the Senator from Illinois, the Military Commissions Act \nof 2006, I have been restrained in making comments on this process, \nalthough I admit I have had to bite my lip a few times because I \nbelieved the process that was underway was responsible.\n  Let me go back and talk a little bit about the beginnings of why this \nact is necessary and where we are now. We have been in some very \ndifficult times and some uncharted waters when it comes to the war on \nterror since September 11. It has challenged us in many ways to deal \nwith problems we have not had to deal with before, with an amorphous \nenemy which does not line up in uniform, in rank, but takes the vehicle \nof suicide bombers or roadside bombs--the worst of all possible attacks \non innocent men and women and children--with no uniform, with no \nconcern for what it does to these innocent people, not to mention those \nwho are trying to bring about greater peace and democracy and \nopportunity and security in the world, in Afghanistan and Iraq and the \nMiddle East and, yes, here at home.\n  We are working through this as we go forward. These are unique times. \nIn this process, we have been able to capture and deter some of the \nworst of the worst jihadists in the world, intent on killing our \nsoldiers and innocent men and women. We have had to deal with them. \nThese are not people who ordinarily have been captured who would be \ncovered by the Geneva Conventions. They are not serving in a country's \nmilitary; they are murderers of the worst sort.\n  We have had to deal with this issue. This administration has dealt \nwith it. They have done it responsibly. Have they made some mistakes? \nWhy, of course; we are human beings.\n  All of this led to a very unfortunate Supreme Court decision, \nreferred to--again, unfortunately--as the Hamdan decision. The Supreme \nCourt clearly made a mistake. I must admit I was disappointed in some \nof the rulings of the judges, but it has forced our hand to try to make \nit clear in the law and with the administration how we are going to \ndeal with this question of interrogating these terrorists, how we are \ngoing to deal with some of the evidence that is acquired through that \nprocess. The administration has been working with the lawyers, with the \nCongress, and with the Senate to try to work through this issue.\n  Some people were very distraught last week that we seemed to be \nhaving disagreement within our own ranks on the Republican side of the \naisle where three or four Senators or some Senators had some concerns. \nI felt very differently. Finally, we were dealing with issues that \nreally matter. Questions of law, how we deal with the terrorists, how \nwe deal with the evidence--these are very serious discussions, the \nkinds of things the Senate should be doing a lot more of.\n  While one can disagree with who was doing what, we went through a \nprocess, took up legitimate questions of the law--how to deal with the \nGeneva Convention; how is it perceived--and came to an agreement. I \nstill had my doubts. There are parts I still do not particularly like. \nI thought it was a very good process, with a lot of different people, a \nlot of lawyers, a lot of military people, a lot of leadership in the \nCongress, and they came up with a conclusion. I have had occasion now \nto take a look at what they came up with, had questions about, and it \nis pretty good. However, it is an area where we must act because if we \ndo not act, we are not--the administration, the Government--going to \nknow how to deal with interrogation or with the terrorists or how to \ndeal with the evidence. This is a case where we do not have the luxury \nof not dealing with this issue. We have to do it.\n  In some other areas, we should act. The electronic wiretaps matter--\nwe should deal with that, but we don't have it. We can go forward on \nthe law as it is. In this case, we have to clarify the situation, or \nthese people who are being held in Guantanamo Bay are going to be \nhanging in limbo. If you are worried about them, which I am not \nparticularly, there needs to be a process of how we will deal with \nthem.\n  That is how we got where we are. That is now pending as an amendment \nto the border security bill that provides for a fence along our \nsouthern border with Mexico. That is not the way it should be done. It \nshould be considered clean. But it is typical of what has happened all \nyear long in the Senate. The whole operation from the other side of the \naisle is delay it, drag it out, don't cooperate. Why can't we at least \ndebate? Why have we gone through a day and a half of nothingness \ninstead of considering and debating the substance of the amendment \nwhich should be a bill and also the substance of border security? Does \nanyone here want to leave to go home for an election period--and that \nis what this is really all about--without having addressed how we do \nthe military trials and without having done something more significant \nabout border security? Not me, although I suspect there are some who \nsay: Yes, let's don't let anything happen; then we can blame Senators, \ncertain people, leaders, whatever, the administration, because nothing \nhappened. Nice deal if you can pull it off. I don't believe the \nAmerican people will buy that deal.\n\n  Also, in listening to some of the comments in the Senate, it stuns \nme. First of all, I am an attorney. I have not practiced for a long \ntime. I find myself now involved in a lawsuit. Whenever they say, \n``Bring on the lawyers,'' look out, because now we are going to get \ninto a huge, big discussion of the niceties of trials and evidence and \nall of that, and we are guaranteed to have a lot of confusion moving \nforward.\n  I wish to again emphasize what we are dealing with. We are dealing \nwith, I believe Colin Powell was quoted as saying, the most vicious \nkillers in the world. These are bad people. These are the people who \nadmit they are jihadists. And if they get out, they would do everything \nto kill Americans, Europeans, Asians--anyone they think does not agree \nwith their religious positions. These are not citizens, these are not \nemployees of the government, and these are not soldiers. These are \nextremist jihadists of the worst sort.\n  Now we have people worrying about how they are going to be \nincarcerated or interrogated or what evidence would be admissible. \nLawyers can work that out. I know enough about the law to know that \njudges and juries can decipher the legitimacy of evidence and how it \nwas obtained. The parsing we have been through is a disgrace, in my \nopinion.\n  In terms of the interrogation, yes, we have to be concerned about our \ntreaty obligations. Our President and our Government have to be \nconcerned\n\n[[Page S10239]]\n\nabout that. Senators, too. We have already voted, and I voted, to \nclarify our position that we are opposed to torture. I voted for the \nMcCain position. But now, what we are arguing over, I am concerned. \nWhat are we going to do in terms of interrogation to get information \nthat can save one marine's life or thousands of innocent people? Are we \ngoing to ask them: Please, pretty please? When they let on like some of \nthe techniques that have been used are such horrible things--being \nthreatened by a dog? Come on. Have they never delivered laundry to \nsomeone's house and had a dog come after them? Have they never lived? \nNow being threatened by a dog is considered what--torture? Oh, by the \nway, we can't have them in stressful positions. What is that? You mean \nlike standing up? Some of these complaints are absolutely ludicrous. \nAre we going to be careful not to insult them in some way? How are we \ngoing to get this information?\n  And by the way, now our men and women who have to find a way to get \ninformation from these worst of the worst vicious killers in the world \ncould be liable, and even worse than that, when they thought they were \ncomplying with the law as they understood it and as their superiors \ntold them, they could be liable to be tried--after the fact.\n  This legislation at least says that prospectively, here is going to \nbe what is expected. If you exceed this, if you get over into the \ntorture area, yes, you will be liable. But to go back and say, now, \nwait a minute, what you did could make you liable, when we have people \ntrying to do their job for the American people--our soldiers in Iraq \nand Afghanistan now could be sued, and there are complaints that we are \nnot going to make sure these people are not going to be, after the \nfact, ex post facto, tried? These same people are talking about amnesty \nfor people illegally in America. Yet when they talk about amnesty for \npeople doing their job as best they could, as they understood the law, \nno, we do not want to give them amnesty. That would be a horrible \nmistake, if we do not provide some clarity and some protection for \nthose who may have exceeded that clarity in the past even though they \nunderstood what they were doing was wrong.\n  Now we have this huge discussion about habeas corpus. Bring on the \nlawyers. What a wonderful thing we can do to come up with words like \nthis. Our forefathers were thinking about citizens, Americans. They \nwere not conceiving of these terrorists who are killing these innocent \nmen, women, and children. These are not citizens. These are not people \nin America. We want them turned loose arbitrarily and then on the other \nhand turn around and, say, criticize the administration because some \npeople who were caught in this process were subsequently released when \nyou find out maybe they shouldn't have been?\n  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the political season, I am sorry to \nsay. I would have thought the Senate could rise above all this partisan \npolitical stuff. Everybody is trying to rewrite history or rewrite the \nlaw or prove a mistake was made or this intelligence was available \nwhich was different from that intelligence. Who is taking the time and \nlooking at where we are now? Where do we want to be? How are we going \nto handle interrogations? How are we going to handle evidence? How are \nwe going to do a better job for our men and women in the decisions we \nmake in Iraq and Afghanistan? Who is looking for the future around \nhere? No, we are all throwing political spears at each other. I don't \nthink the American people appreciate that. It is embarrassing, quite \nfrankly, to me.\n  I have been on the Intelligence Committee for 4 years, and for 4 \nyears we have been going back trying to refigure the intelligence. We \nhave found out the intelligence we were receiving in that committee--\nthe Senators, Congressmen, and the President--was not as good as it \nshould have been. Okay, good. Admit that. Now what are we going to do \nabout it? How many hearings do we have where the CIA and the Director \nof National Intelligence were asked: What are you doing to implement \nthe law we put in place to address the problems we found? Where are we \ngoing to be in the future? What have we done to actually go to meet \nwith our CIA agents around the world and hear what the real country \nsituation is in critical parts of the world? Not one time have we done \nthat.\n  No, even the Intelligence Committee, which for years the Senate \nworked to make sure it stayed nonpartisan, bipartisan, and worked \ntogether for the good of the country, in close quarters, now is just \nanother partisan committee. Staff fight each other; intelligence \ninformation is leaked; classified intelligence information is leaked to \nthe New York Times and the Washington Post. No one is identified. No \none is punished for that.\n  What worries me, this is not just about politics; this is about \npeople's lives. People get killed based on the intelligence we get or \ndon't get or the oversight we have.\n  I hope we can complete our work. Hopefully, it will be good work by \nthe end of the week.\n\n  Let's go home and get this political period over with, but when we \ncome back next year, I think it is time we assess where we are. How are \nwe going to do a better job? What is America's agenda? What can we do \ntogether in a bipartisan way? Is there anything left? And if we do not, \nI think there will be a pox on all of our houses.\n  So on this particular subject of the Military Commissions Act of \n2006, let's get it up, let's debate it, and let's have a vote. We have \nto do it. I think they have done pretty good work. If I could get in a \nroom with my lawyers, yes, I would write it differently. I think more \nof that evidence should be admissable with less restraints. I think \nmore of the techniques that have been used in the interrogation of \nterrorists should be used than are in this provision. Once again, it is \nnot perfect, but it is good enough. It is the right thing to do.\n  Madam President, observing no Senator wishing to speak at this time, \nI suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

Madam President, the hardest decisions we make in the \nSenate involve asking our fellow Americans to risk their health and \ntheir lives in defense of our country. The cost to our country, to our \ncommunities, and to our families is so great that in any war we have an \nobligation to make sure we are doing right by our service members, by \nour veterans, and by our country.\n  That is why we in this Congress need to ask questions. We need to ask \nquestions such as: Do our troops have a clear mission? Is there a plan \nto achieve that mission? Do our troops have the support and equipment \nthey need to succeed? Do we have the right people in place? And are we \ntaking care of our veterans when they return home from military \nservice?\n  For too long, this Congress has not done its job of asking those \nquestions and demanding answers. Here in Congress, we have a \nresponsibility. We have a responsibility to make sure the Bush \nadministration, or any administration, is fulfilling those critical \nrequirements. So today I rise to offer an update on where we stand on \nsome of these questions and to share some disturbing news from recent \nreports. The evidence I am going to share with my colleagues today \npoints to five disappointing conclusions, and they all demand hearings \nand they demand accountability.\n\n  First of all, the Bush administration misled Congress about its \nfailures in planning for the care of America's veterans.\n  Secondly, the Bush administration still does not have a plan to care \nfor our veterans.\n  Third, we do not have a clear mission in the war in Iraq. And that \nfight has greatly impacted our ability to prosecute the broader war on \nterror and, according to the latest intelligence estimate, has helped \nto fuel new terrorist recruits.\n\n[[Page S10240]]\n\n  Fourth, the Bush administration has put politics over progress in \nIraq and at home. In Iraq, it sent political cronies to staff the \nprovisional government instead of experienced professionals who could \nget the job done. From ``Brownie'' at FEMA to new reports about the HUD \nSecretary, the Bush administration put politics over competence.\n  Finally, Congress--us--we are not doing our job of oversight. Unless \nwe hold hearings, until we demand answers, and until we require \naccountability, we will just keep muddling through with the same poor \nresults.\n  We can do a lot better. We can be safer. And we can be more \nsuccessful. But it has to start with an honest assessment of what is \nworking, what is not, and what we need to change.\n  In that spirit, I want to discuss those five conclusions I mentioned, \nstarting with the fact that the Bush administration misled Congress \nabout its inadequate efforts to care for our veterans.\n  Over the past 2 budget years, the Bush administration was \ndramatically wrong in its planning for veterans health care. The result \nwas a $3 billion shortfall last summer. And this was not just a failure \nin planning. It meant failing to get our veterans the services they \nrequired in a timely fashion. It meant veterans had to face long waits \nto see a doctor. And it meant they did not get the care they deserved.\n  That horrible planning is no way to care for the veterans who have \nsacrificed so much for us. We can do better. That is why after that \nfailure I joined with Senators Akaka, Durbin, and Salazar. Together we \nasked the Government Accountability Office to investigate what happened \nat the VA. Well, this is the report we got back. Frankly, the answers \nare pretty damning, and they cast doubt on whether we can rely on this \nVA for accurate numbers and straight answers.\n  I wish to focus on the four findings in this report.\n  First of all, the GAO found that the VA knew it had serious problems \nwith its budget, but they failed to notify Congress, all of us here. \nEven worse, they misled us. The report suggests that the VA could \nstill, today, be sending us inaccurate information in its quarterly \nreports.\n  Secondly, the GAO found that the VA was basing its budgets on \n``unrealistic assumptions, errors in estimation, and insufficient \ndata.''\n  Third, the Pentagon failed to give the VA up-to-date information \nabout how many service members would be coming down the pipeline and \ninto the VA.\n  Finally, the GAO found that the VA did not adequately plan for the \nimpact of service members coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  For me, I think one of the most disturbing findings is that the VA \nkept assuring us here in Congress that everything was fine, while \ninside the VA--at the same time it was assuring us things were fine--it \nwas very clear that the shortfalls were growing. The VA, in fact, \nbecame aware it would have a problem. In October of 2004, inside the \nVA, they knew they had problems, but they did not admit those problems \nuntil June of 2005. Veterans were telling me of long lines and delays \nin care. For months, I tried to give the VA more money, but the \nadministration fought me every step of the way. And who paid the price \nfor those deceptions? America's veterans, and that was just wrong.\n  Let me walk through some of the deceptions found in this GAO report. \nIt shows a very troubling gap between what the VA knew and what the VA \ntold us.\n  According to the GAO report, starting back in October 2004, the VA \nknew that money was tight. It anticipated serious budget challenges, \nand it created, inside the VA, a ``Budget Challenges'' working group.\n  Two months later, in December of 2004, that budget group made \ninternal recommendations inside the VA to deal with the shortfall they \nknew they had. They suggested delaying new initiatives and shifting \naround funding.\n  Two months later, in February of 2005, the Bush administration \nreleased its budget proposal for 2006. The GAO found that budget was \nbased on ``unrealistic assumptions, errors in estimation, and \ninsufficient data.''\n  A week later, at a hearing on February 15, here, I asked the VA \nSecretary if the President's budget was sufficient. He told me:\n\n       I have many of the same concerns, and I end up being \n     satisfied that we can get the job done with this budget.\n\n  Let's remember what was happening back at that time. I was hearing \nfrom veterans that they were facing delays in care and that the VA \nsystem was stretched to capacity. But the VA kept saying: Everything is \nfine.\n  On March 8, Secretary Nicholson told a House committee that the \nPresident's fiscal year 2006 budget ``gives VA what it needs.'' Well, I \nwas hearing a much different story as I spoke with veterans in my home \nState and around the country. So that is why on March 10 I offered an \namendment in the Senate Budget Committee to increase veterans funding \nby 3 percent so we could hire more doctors and provide faster care for \nour veterans. Unfortunately, the Republican majority said no.\n  Now, that same month, while that was happening, the VA's internal \nmonthly reports showed that demand for health care was exceeding \nprojections. That was another warning sign that the VA should have \nshared with us, but it did not.\n  On March 16, Senator Akaka and I offered an amendment here on the \nSenate floor to increase veterans funding by $2.85 billion. Once again, \nthe Republican majority said no.\n  The next month, on April 5, Secretary Nicholson wrote to Senator \nHutchison:\n\n       I can assure you that the VA does not need emergency \n     supplemental funds in FY 2005.\n\n  A week later, on April 12, I offered two amendments on the Senate \nfloor to boost veterans funding. First, I asked the Senate to agree \nthat the lack of veterans funding was an emergency and we had to fix \nit. The Republican majority said no. So I asked the Senate to agree \nthat supporting our veterans ought to be a priority. Again, the \nRepublican majority said no. As a result, veterans did not get the \nfunding they needed and the deception continued.\n  On June 9, I asked Secretary Nicholson at a hearing if he had enough \nfunding to deal with the mental health challenges of veterans returning \nfrom Iraq and Afghanistan. He assured me the VA was fine.\n  So for 6 months, we had happy talk that everything was fine within \nthe VA. Then, in June, just 2 weeks after the Secretary's latest \nassurance, the truth finally came out.\n  On June 23, the VA revealed a massive shortfall of $3 billion. Well, \nI went to work with my colleagues and we came up with the funding. But \nwe could have solved that problem much earlier and saved our veterans \nthe delays they were experiencing.\n  By misleading us the entire time, the Bush administration hurt our \nAmerican veterans. We could have provided the money when it was needed. \nWe could have been hiring the doctors and nurses we needed. We could \nhave been buying the medical equipment that was needed. And we could \nhave been helping thousands of veterans who were sitting on waiting \nlists waiting for care.\n  Here is the bottom line. The Bush administration knew about this \nproblem in October of 2004. They saw it getting worse month by month, \nbut here in the Senate, in the House, they assured us everything was \nfine. They worked adamantly to defeat my amendments to provide funding, \nand they did not come clean until June of 2005.\n  That is unacceptable. I think our veterans deserve real answers.\n  This GAO report shows that the VA was not telling us in Congress the \ntruth and was fighting those of us who were trying to help. I think we \nneed to bring Secretary Nicholson before the Veterans Affairs' \nCommittee so we can get real answers. We need to ensure that the VA \ndoesn't repeat the same mistake of the past 2 years. We owe that to our \ncurrent and future veterans who sacrifice so much for us.\n  We need an explanation of why the VA lied to us about the so-called \n``management efficiency.'' The GAO found those alleged savings were \nnothing but ``hot air.'' This report clearly shows the Bush \nadministration misrepresented the truth to us in Congress for 4 fiscal \nyears, through 4 budgets, and 4 appropriations cycles about those bogus \nsavings. When they could not make these efficiencies a reality, they \ntook the funds from veterans' health care. That, too, is unacceptable.\n  This report also suggests that even in its latest quarterly reports \nto us, the\n\n[[Page S10241]]\n\nVA is slow to report and doesn't provide key information we required, \nsuch as the time required for veterans to get their first appointment.\n  The GAO report also says that the Department of Defense failed to \nprovide the VA up-to-date information on how many service members would \nbe separating from service and seeking care at the VA.\n  That is frustrating to me because I have been asking every general \nwho comes up here if they are doing enough to ensure a smooth \ntransition from the Pentagon to the VA. In fact, on February 16 of last \nyear, I questioned Secretary Rumsfeld directly. I got him to agree that \ncaring for our veterans is part of the cost of a war. But he had no \nreal answer when I asked why his request for the war did not include \nfunding to care for our veterans.\n  Finally, the GAO report verifies that the VA failed to plan for the \nimpact of the veterans who are coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan. I \nam very concerned that the Bush administration still, today, right now, \ndoes not have a plan to meet the needs of our returning service \nmembers.\n  Look at the gap between what the VA told us it needs and what we are \nactually spending on veterans' health care. In July, a few months ago, \nthe VA sent an estimate to the Congressional Budget Office. The VA said \nit would need $1 billion a year for 10 years to care for veterans from \nIraq.\n  But here is the problem. We are already spending more than $1 billion \nthis year, and we still have not seen the lion's share of veterans \nreturn home. There will be more veterans needing help, and $1 billion a \nyear is not going to cut it.\n  I have heard some of my colleagues speak about the generous increases \nto VA programs, and I agree they have been helpful. But unless the \ndollars we provide meet the needs of our veterans, we will not have \nfulfilled our responsibility to those we have asked to go to war for \nus.\n  Let's focus on one area of veterans health care--support for mental \nhealth challenges, such as post-traumatic stress disorder. Here is what \nthe Associated Press said recently:\n\n       More than one-third of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans \n     seeking medical treatment from the Veterans Health \n     Administration report symptoms of stress or other mental \n     disorders--a tenfold increase in the last 18 months, \n     according to an agency study.\n\n  That is from the Associated Press. It is a good thing that veterans \nare coming home and seeking help. I hope it means we have made it \neasier to get care and we have reduced the stigma associated with the \ninvisible impacts of war. During the Vietnam war, I saw those \nchallenges firsthand when I volunteered in the psychiatric ward of the \nSeattle VA hospital.\n  I think it is good that our veterans are coming home and asking for \ncare, but we have to make sure it is our responsibility in this \nCongress that we have the funding to meet that need.\n  The AP article I mentioned talks about a soldier from Virginia Beach, \nVA, who was having a hard time sleeping when he came home from Iraq. Do \nyou know what he was told? He was told he would have to wait 2\\1/2\\ \nmonths for an appointment at the VA facility.\n  Here is a service member who has gone to war in Iraq, done what his \ncountry asked, and he comes home and asks for help, and all he is told \nby the VA is to get in line and wait 75 days. I find that pretty \ndisgraceful.\n  I have held a number of discussions in my home State of Washington \nwith our veterans and with mental health experts. I was recently in \nEverett, WA, on August 17. I heard about the challenges they are facing \non the ground.\n  Whether it is dealing with a large number of veterans with severe \nphysical injuries, or traumatic brain injuries, the VA has no plan to \ndeal with this.\n  Whether it is dealing with the 16 percent of wounded service members \ncoming back from Iraq with eye injuries, which Walter Reed reported in \nAugust, the VA has no plan to deal with this.\n\n  Whether it is dealing with one-third of all service members to return \nhome and separate from the military, who are seeking mental health \nservices, the VA has no plan. And we in Congress are still not getting \nstraight answers.\n  In that AP article, a VA official said he is not aware of problems \nwith veterans getting mental health services. Dr. Michael Kussman is \nquoted as saying:\n\n       We're not aware that people are having trouble getting \n     services from us in any consistent way or pattern around the \n     country.\n\n  A lot of our veterans advocates disagree with that. In fact, another \nVA official pointed to serious problems in meeting the mental health \nneed of our veterans.\n  In the May edition of the Psychiatric News, Dr. Frances Murphy, the \nUnder Secretary of Health Policy Coordination at the VA, said the \nagency is ill-prepared to serve the mental health needs of our Nation's \nveterans.\n  In that article, Dr. Murphy notes that some VA clinics don't provide \nmental health or substance abuse care, or if they do, ``waiting lists \nrender that care virtually inaccessible.''\n  The Bush administration has failed to deliver our veterans the care \nthey need, denying them the respect they deserve. Given the VA's bad \ntrack record and misleading statements, we need to demand in Congress a \nreal plan from the VA to ensure that our veterans get the care they \nhave earned.\n  Another question we need to be asking in the Senate is about our \nmission in Iraq today. Unless we have clarity and purpose of mission, \nwe are not going to know when we have achieved it and when our troops \ncan come home.\n  We all want the same thing in Iraq--for our troops to complete their \nmission successfully and come home safely. But today our troops' \nmission in Iraq lacks clarity. What are they accomplishing there today? \nOverthrowing Saddam Hussein? They already accomplished that. Looking \nfor weapons of mass destruction? They looked; no weapons were found. \nAre they supposed to be setting up an Iraqi government? We have done \nthat. The Iraqi people have created a constitution, elected leaders, \nand filled their Cabinet.\n  Our troops have done everything we have asked them to do. What is \nleft? Will the President's policies get us there? That is the \ndiscussion we ought to be having in the Congress. But every time we ask \nthese questions, we get the same empty response from the President, his \nCabinet, and the Congress: Stay the course.\n  Stay the course is not a good plan, if the course you are on is not \nworking. We also have to get to the truth about the relationship \nbetween Iraq and the broader war on terror.\n  On September 6, on the floor of the Senate, I warned that the \nPresident's focus on Iraq has distracted us from the larger war on \nterror. I said the President took a detour from the war on terror and \ninvested the majority of our resources into Iraq--seemingly forever.\n  That weakens our ability to fight the broader war on terror and it \nleaves us vulnerable. We have not made the investments here at home to \nprotect ourselves, and we have not finished our work against al-Qaida. \nBin Laden is still on the loose. Afghanistan is a mess, and United \nStates troops are imperiled.\n  Today, 3 weeks after I gave that speech on the Senate floor, we \nlearned that the National Intelligence Estimate concluded that the war \nin Iraq helped to fuel the recruitment of new terrorists. The \nadministration's failure to plan and face the truth in Iraq demands \ncongressional hearings so we can chart a better course.\n  We also need to examine how the Bush administration bungled Iraqi \nreconstruction. On September 17, the Washington Post ran a story titled \n``Ties to GOP Trumped Know-How Among Staff Sent to Rebuild Iraq.'' That \narticle describes how Americans were selected to work in Iraq for the \nCoalition Provisional Authority. That article said:\n\n       Applicants didn't need to be experts in the Middle East or \n     in post-conflict reconstruction. What seemed most important \n     was loyalty to the Bush administration.\n\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       The decision to send the loyal and the willing, instead of \n     the best and the brightest, is now regarded by many people \n     involved in the 3 and a half year effort to stabilize and \n     rebuild Iraq as one of the Bush administration's gravest \n     errors.\n       Many of those selected because of their political fidelity \n     spent their time trying to impose a conservative agenda on \n     the postwar occupation, which sidetracked more important \n     reconstruction efforts and squandered good will among the \n     Iraqi people, according to many people who participated in \n     the reconstruction effort.\n\n  They had a political loyalty test instead of a competence test, and \nthat\n\n[[Page S10242]]\n\nmay be responsible for how long we have had to stay in Iraq and the \nproblems we now face. Congress--us--we need to look at that and we need \nto hold people accountable.\n\n  Unfortunately, this pattern and practice of political favoritism \nwithin the administration extends beyond Iraq to how the Bush \nadministration handles Government contracts here at home. Just last \nweek, we got new evidence that a member of the President's Cabinet has \nmade a series of statements that highlighted the importance of politics \nin awarding Government contracts in his agency.\n  In May, I asked the Inspector General at HUD to look into Secretary \nAlphonso Jackson's public statements that he deliberately denied a \ncontract to a firm that had been critical of President Bush. Now, last \nweek, the IG sent me the results of that investigation. This report is \n340 pages long, with hundreds of pages of sworn testimony from dozens \nof HUD officials. This report includes sworn statements from HUD \npersonnel, stating that Secretary Jackson told his staff to monitor the \npolitical affiliation of contract competitors and consider those \naffiliations in the awarding of contracts.\n  Secretary Jackson said that a HUD contractor had strong political \naffiliations that were not supportive of the President, and the \nSecretary said he did not want the contractor to receive any additional \nHUD contracts. As a result, the contractor's award was subjected to an \nunusual extent of delay and review.\n  So we have a Cabinet Secretary telling his staff to issue contracts \nbased on politics, not based on who can do the best job for us, the \nAmerican taxpayers. It is true that, in looking at the record, the \nJustice Department concluded:\n\n       that no apparent criminal violation could be discerned \n     based on evidence to date.\n\n  But the Justice Department came to that conclusion only because HUD \nstaff actually ignored the Secretary's inappropriate instructions.\n  When you combine what has been going on at HUD with what happened at \nthe CPA in Iraq and reports about similar issues at the Department of \nthe Interior, it is clear that this Congress--all of us--needs to \ndemand accountability.\n  That is why, last week, I wrote to White House Chief of Staff Josh \nBolten and urged him to take immediate steps to ensure that political \nfavoritism and discrimination do not play a role in Federal contracts.\n  I recognize we cannot rely on the White House Chief of Staff to clean \nup the Bush administration, which brings me to my final point this \nmorning.\n  We need real oversight. In this Congress, there has been very little \noversight of this administration. The President has basically had free \nreign because of this Republican-controlled Congress, and we have \nfailed to do the job in asking tough questions and demanding answers.\n  Norman Ornstein is an expert on Congress at the conservative American \nEnterprise Institute, and he said this Congress is the worst he has \nseen in terms of oversight.\n  He told the Philadelphia Inquirer:\n\n       These people have long thought of themselves as foot \n     soldiers in the President's army, and their view is that \n     oversight is something to avoid, lest they find something \n     that might embarrass the administration. I don't see a single \n     sign that this attitude will substantially change.\n\n  That was congressional expert Norman Ornstein on the Republican \nfailure to oversee the Bush administration.\n  Democrats are trying to provide the oversight that Republicans so far \nhave been unwilling to provide. On Monday, in fact, the Democratic \nPolicy Committee held a hearing on preparations for the war in Iraq. \nRetired military leaders at that hearing told us that the Bush \nadministration failed to plan for the war and that the administration \nmisled the American people.\n  We had to hold those hearings under a policy committee banner because \nRepublicans would not hold real committee oversight hearings. We have \nto have oversight here, no matter what the administration is, \nRepublican or Democratic, so that we as Members of this body who \nrepresent people across the country can learn the facts and we can fix \nthings that are not going well. That is our job. If we never have real \nhearings, if we never demand real accountability, well, we will never \nget good results.\n  I believe America can do a lot better. I believe we can be more \nsecure. I believe our troops can be safer. But it has to start with the \ntruth, not rosy predictions of how things will be, not declarations of \nwill that gloss over the facts on the ground, not corruption in \npolitics holding back progress. Simply the truth. And, so far, this \nCongress has been unwilling to let our citizens learn the truth.\n  I think the American people deserve better, and I hope each one of us \ngoes home and thinks about what our responsibility is to the people we \nrepresent and to the future of this country.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, for the information of our colleagues, we \nwill engage in a unanimous consent request which will set out the \nactivity for the afternoon and possibly early evening on the Supreme \nCourt Hamdan decision.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the cloture motion with respect to \namendment No. 5036 be withdrawn, and that further, the cloture vote \nscheduled in relation to H.R. 6061 be delayed to occur following the \ndisposition of S. 3930, and that the Senate now proceed to the \nconsideration of Calendar No. 634, S. 3930, relating to military \ntribunals; provided further, that the substitute amendment, the text of \nwhich is at the desk, be considered and agreed to as original text for \nthe purpose of further amendment; provided further, that the only other \namendments in order, other than any managers' amendments which are to \nbe cleared by both managers and the two leaders, be the following:\n  Levin, substitute; Rockefeller, congressional oversight; Kennedy, \ninterrogation; Byrd, sunset; Specter, habeas.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that the listed amendments be limited \nto 60 minutes equally divided between the two leaders or their \ndesignees, other than the Specter amendment and the Levin amendment \nwhich will be limited to 2 hours equally divided, as stated above, and \nthat there be 3 hours for general debate equally divided, again, \nbetween the two leaders or their designees.

I wanted the record to reflect--in case \nSenator Leahy is watching us because he wanted to make sure he would \nhave 45 minutes on his amendments and 15 minutes on the bill--it is my \nunderstanding Senator Specter will be giving him 15 minutes of his \ntime, but if he doesn't, I will take it from the bill. So Senator Leahy \nwill have his 45 minutes, 15 minutes on this bill.\n  So I think this is an opportunity to improve this bill. We would all \nlike to have had more time for hearings and debate on the floor, but we \nare where we are.

The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 3930) to authorize trial by military commission \n     for violations of the law of war, and for other purposes.\n\n  The amendment (No. 5085) was agreed to.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, for 5 years we have been a nation at war. \nIt is a war unlike any we have ever before fought. It is an ideological \nwar against radicals and zealots. We are fighting a different kind of \nenemy--an enemy who seeks to destroy our values, to destroy our \nfreedom, and to destroy our way of life, people who will kill and who \nwill actually stop at nothing to bring America to its knees. It is a \nwar against an enemy who won't back down, ever, telling interrogators: \nI will never forget your face. I will kill you. I will kill your \nbrothers, your mother, your sisters. It is a war against an enemy who \nundertakes years of psychological training to consciously resist \ninterrogation and to withhold information that could be critical to \nthwarting future threats, future attacks. But it is also a physical \nwar. On the field of battle, it is a war that demands quick thinking \nand creativity. It demands tactics that entice the enemy to reveal his \nweaknesses.\n  As we learned 5 years ago, safety and security aren't static states; \nthey are dynamic, constantly shifting, constantly moving. We \nconsistently and repeatedly have to be able to adjust and take stock \nand reassess and, when necessary, implement changes in response.\n  In the past 5 years alone, in this body we have passed more than 70 \nlaws and other bills related to the war on terror, but they haven't \nbeen enough. They haven't kept pace with the ever-changing field of \nbattle. There is more we can do and, indeed, we must do. That is why \nover the last month we have focused the Senate agenda on security, and \nthat is why today we address our Nation's security by debating one of \nthe most serious and most urgent security issues currently facing the \nNation: the detainment, questioning, and prosecution of enemy \ncombatants--terrorists captured on the battlefield.\n  A few weeks ago, I traveled with several of my colleagues to \nGuantanamo Bay. That is where the mastermind of 9/11 currently \nresides--Khalid Shaikh Mohammed. This man, the man the 9/11 Commission \ncalls the principal architect behind the 9/11 attacks, didn't stop with \n9/11. Not 1 month after 9/11, he was busy again plotting and planning, \norchestrating, scheming, and conspiring to strike us again while we \nwere still down. His next plot targeted the tallest buildings on the \nwest coast with hijacked planes, buildings that house businesses and \norganizations absolutely critical to our economic and our financial \nstability, including the Library Tower in Los Angeles, CA. But this \ntime, we were ready. We thwarted that plot, and Khalid Shaikh Mohammed \nnow resides at Guantanamo. But he wouldn't reside there and we wouldn't \nhave stymied his evil designs at that Library Tower if not for the \nability to question detainees.\n  Soon after 9/11, we detained an al-Qaida operative known as Abu \nZubaydah. Under questioning, he yielded several operational leads. He \nrevealed Shaikh Mohammed's role in the 9/11 attacks. Coupled with other \nsources, the information he gave up led to Shaikh Mohammed's capture \nand detainment. Khalid Shaikh Mohammed currently awaits prosecution. \nThat prosecution cannot happen until we act. Our great Nation will know \nno justice--and his victims' families will know no justice--until \nCongress acts by passing legislation to establish these military \ncommissions.\n  Before we recess this week, we will complete this bill. We could \ncomplete it possibly today but if not, in the morning. The bill itself \nprovides a legislative framework to detain, question, and prosecute \nterrorists. It reflects the agreement reached last week: Republicans \nunited around the common goal of bringing terrorists to justice. It \npreserves our intelligence programs--intelligence programs that have \ndisrupted terrorist plots and saved countless American lives.\n  When we capture terrorists on the battlefield, we have a right to \nprosecute them for war crimes. This bill establishes a system that \nprotects our national security while ensuring a full and fair trial for \ndetainees. The bill formally establishes terrorist tribunals to \nprosecute terrorists engaged in hostilities against the United States \nfor war crimes. Terrorist detainees will be tried by a 5- or 12-member \nmilitary commission overseen by a military judge. They will have the \nright to be presumed innocent until proven guilty, the right to \nmilitary and civilian counsel, the right to present exculpatory \nevidence, the right to exclude evidence obtained through torture, and \nthe right to appeal.\n  The bill also protects classified information--our critical sources \nand methods--from terrorists who could exploit it to plan another \nterrorist attack. It provides a national security privilege that can be \nasserted at trial to prevent the introduction of classified evidence. \nBut the accused can be provided a declassified summary of that \nevidence.\n  Moreover, the bill provides legal clarity for our treaty obligations \nunder the Geneva Conventions. It establishes a specific list of crimes \nthat are considered grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions.\n  Ultimately, these procedures recognize that because we are at war, we \nshould not try terrorists in the same way as our uniformed military or \ncommon civilian criminals. We must remember that we are fighting a \ndifferent kind of enemy in a different kind of war. We are fighting an \nenemy who seeks to destroy our values, our freedoms, and our very way \nof life.\n  To win this war, we must provide our military, intelligence, and law \nenforcement communities the tools they need to keep us safe. By \nformally establishing terrorist tribunals, the bill provides another \ncritical tool in fighting the war on terror, and it provides a measure \nof justice to the victims of 9/11.\n  Until Congress passes this legislation, terrorists such as Khalid \nShaikh Mohammed cannot be tried for war crimes, and the United States \nrisks fighting a blind war without adequate intelligence to keep us \nsafe. That is simply unacceptable, and that is why this bill must be \npassed.\n  I look forward over the next few hours to an open and civilized \ndebate in the best traditions of the Senate. I urge my colleagues--\nRepublican, Democrat, and Independent alike--to work together to pass \nthis bill. The American people can't afford to wait. Even though we are \nin the midst of an election year, this issue--the safety and security \nof the American people--should transcend partisan politics. The time to \nact is now.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield myself 15 minutes off the bill \nitself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first let me begin by commending our \ncolleagues on the Armed Services Committee, Senator Warner, Senator \nMcCain, and Senator Graham, for their effort earlier this month to \nproduce a military commissions bill that will protect our troops, \nwithstand judicial review, and be consistent with American values. The \nadministration of their own party had prepared a bill that would \nauthorize violations of our obligations under international law, permit \nthe abusive treatment of prisoners, and allow criminal convictions \nbased on secret evidence. The three Senators drafted a different bill, \nin consultation with our senior military lawyers. When the \nadministration objected to this bill, Senator Warner scheduled a markup \nin the Senate Armed Services Committee anyway, and we reported that \nbill out with a bipartisan vote of 15 to 9.\n  Unlike the administration bill, the committee bill would not have \nallowed convictions based on secret testimony that is never revealed to \nthe accused. The committee bill would not have allowed testimony \nobtained through cruel or inhuman treatment. The committee bill would \nnot have allowed the use of hearsay where a better source of evidence \nis readily available. The committee bill would not have attempted to \nreinterpret our obligations under international law to permit the abuse \nof detainees in U.S. custody.\n\n[[Page S10244]]\n\n  While the committee bill was not perfect--in particular, it included \na very problematic provision on the writ of habeas corpus--the military \ncommissions it established would have met the test of the Supreme \nCourt's decision in the Hamdan case and provided for the trial of \ndetainees for war crimes in a manner that is consistent with American \nvalues and the American system of justice. It provided standards we \nwould be able to live with if other countries were to apply similar \nstandards to our troops if our troops were captured. And, of course, \nthe committee bill provided for the interrogation, for the detention, \nand for criminal trials of detainees.\n  Unfortunately, the committee bill was not brought to the Senate. \nInstead, the three Republican Senators entered into negotiations with \nan administration that has been relentless in its determination to \nlegitimize the abuse of detainees and to distort military commission \nprocedures to ensure criminal convictions. The bill before us now is \nthe product of these negotiations. I will be offering the committee-\napproved bill as a substitute a little later today. The bipartisan \ncommittee bill, which came from our committee just about a week ago on \na vote of 15 to 9, will be offered by me as a substitute to the bill \nwhich is now before us.\n  The bill before us does make a few significant improvements over the \nadministration bill. I want to begin by outlining what those \nimprovements are.\n  First, while the bill before us is not as clear as the committee bill \nin committing us to a standard that will protect our troops by \nconforming to our obligations under the Geneva Conventions, it is far \npreferable to the administration bill in this regard. In particular, \nthe bill before us does not reinterpret U.S. obligations for the \ntreatment of detainees under Common Article 3 of the Geneva \nConventions. It does not place a congressional stamp of approval on an \nexecutive branch reinterpretation of those obligations. All it does in \nthis regard is to state the obvious: that the President is responsible \nfor administering the laws and that this gives him the authority to \nadopt regulations interpreting the meaning and application of the \nGeneva Conventions in the same manner and to the same extent as he can \nissue such regulations interpreting other laws.\n  Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions, the Detainee Treatment \nAct, and the new Army Field Manual all prohibit such interrogation \nabuses as forcing a detainee to be naked, to perform sexual acts or \npose in a sexual manner; prevent such abuses as sensory deprivation, \nplacing hoods or sacks over the head of a detainee, applying beatings, \nelectric shock, burns, or other forms of physical pain; waterboarding, \nusing military working dogs, inducing hypothermia or heat injury, \nconducting mock executions, or depriving the detainee of necessary \nfood, water, or medical care. Nothing in this bill would change any of \nthe standards of the Geneva Conventions, the Detainee Treatment Act, or \nthe Army Field Manual. Nothing in this bill would authorize the \nPresident to do so.\n  Second, the bill does not permit the use of secret evidence that is \nnot revealed to the defendant. Instead, the bill clarifies that \ninformation about sources, methods, or activities by which the United \nStates obtained evidence may be redacted before the evidence is \nprovided to the defendant and introduced at trial. Any material \nredacted from the evidence provided to the defendant cannot be \nintroduced at trial. The defendant would have the right to be present \nfor all proceedings and to examine and respond to all evidence \nconsidered by the military commission.\n  This approach is consistent with the approach taken to classified \ninformation in the Manual for Courts Martial, and it ensures that a \ndefendant could not be convicted on the basis of secret evidence, \nevidence that is not known to him.\n  Those are two positive changes from the approach which the \nadministration has argued for and demanded, in these two cases without \nsuccess.\n  Unfortunately, at the insistence of the administration, the bill \nbefore us contains a great many ill-advised changes from the approved \nbill of the Armed Services Committee. For example, on coerced \ntestimony, the committee-approved bill prohibited the admission of \nstatements obtained through cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment. The \nbill before us prohibits the admission of statements obtained after \nDecember 30, 2005, through ``cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment,'' \nbut, inexplicably, contains no such prohibition for statements that \nwere obtained before September 30, 2005. As a result, military \ntribunals would be free to admit, for the first time in U.S. legal \nhistory, statements that were extracted through abusive practices.\n  On the question of hearsay, the committee bill permitted the \nadmission of hearsay evidence not admissible at trials by court-\nmartial, if direct evidence, which is inherently more probative, could \nbe procured ``through reasonable efforts, taking into consideration the \nunique circumstances of the conduct of military and intelligence \noperations during hostilities.''\n  The bill before us makes hearsay evidence admissible unless the \ndefendant can demonstrate that it is unreliable or lacking in probative \nvalue. Hearsay evidence is not only inherently less reliable, its use \nalso deprives the accused of the ability to confront witnesses against \nhim. The approach taken by this bill not only relieves the Government \nof any obligation to seek direct testimony from its witnesses, it also \nappears to shift the burden to the accused by presuming that hearsay \nevidence is reliable unless the accused can demonstrate otherwise.\n  On the question of search warrants, the committee bill, the bill \nwhich I will be offering as a substitute later on today--the committee \nbill provided that evidence seized outside the United States shall not \nbe excluded from trial by military commission on the grounds that the \nevidence was not seized pursuant to a search warrant. The bill before \nus deletes the limitation so that it no longer applies to evidence \nseized outside the United States. As a result, the bill authorizes the \nuse of evidence that is seized inside the United States without a \nsearch warrant. This provision is not limited to evidence seized from \nenemy combatants; it does not even preclude the seizure of evidence \nwithout a warrant from U.S. citizens. As a result, this provision \nappears to authorize the use of evidence that is obtained without a \nwarrant, in violation of the U.S. Constitution.\n  On the definition of unlawful combatant, the committee bill defined \nthe term ``unlawful combatant'' in accordance with the traditional law \nof war. The bill before us, however, changes the definition to add a \npresumption that any person who is ``part of'' the ``associated \nforces'' of a terrorist organization is an unlawful combatant, \nregardless of whether that person actually meets the test of engaging \nin hostilities against the United States or purposefully and materially \nis supporting such hostilities.\n  The bill also adds a new provision which makes the determination of a \nCombatant Status Review Tribunal, or CSRT, that a person is an unlawful \nenemy combatant--it makes that determination dispositive for the \npurpose of the jurisdiction of a military commission, even though the \nCSRT determinations may be based on evidence that would be excluded as \nunreliable by a military commission.\n  On the issue of procedures and rules of evidence, the committee bill \nprovided that the procedures and rules of evidence applicable in trials \nby general courts martial would apply in trials by military commission, \nsubject to such exceptions as the Secretary of Defense determines to be \n``required by the unique circumstances of the conduct of military and \nintelligence operations during hostilities or by other practical \nneed.'' That approach, in our committee bill, was consistent with the \nruling of the Supreme Court in the Hamdan case, but built in \nflexibility to address unique circumstances arising out of military and \nintelligence operations. The bill before us reverses the presumption. \nInstead of starting with the rules applicable in trials by courts \nmartial and establishing exceptions, the Secretary of Defense is \nrequired to make trials by commission consistent with those rules only \nwhen he considers it practicable to do so. As one observer has pointed \nout, this provision is now so vaguely worded that it could even be read \nto authorize the administration to abandon the presumption of\n\n[[Page S10245]]\n\ninnocence in trials by military commission.\n  On the issue of habeas corpus, the habeas corpus provision in the \ncommittee bill stripped alien detainees of habeas corpus rights, even \nif they had no other legal recourse to demonstrate that they were \nimproperly detained. It also stripped those detainees of any other \nrecourse to the U.S. courts for legal actions regarding their detention \nor treatment in U.S. custody. If the committee bill had been brought to \nthe floor, I would have joined in offering an amendment to address the \nobvious problems with this provision. But at least the court-stripping \nprovision in the committee bill was limited to aliens who were detained \noutside of the United States. The bill before us expands that provision \nto eliminate habeas corpus rights and all other legal rights for \naliens, including lawful permanent residents detained inside or outside \nthe United States who have been determined by the United States to be \nthe enemy. The only requirement is that the United States determine \nthat the alien detainee is an enemy combatant--but the bill provides no \nstandard for this determination and offers the detainee no ability to \nchallenge it in those cases which I have identified.\n\n  Consequently, even aliens who have been released from U.S. custody, \nsuch as the detainee that the Canadian Government recently found was \ndetained without any basis and was subjected to torture, would be \ndenied any legal recourse as long as the United States continues to \nclaim that they were properly held.\n  I yield myself an additional 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. In other words, a determination by the United States could \nnot be contested, even if there is overwhelming evidence that the claim \nwas incorrect.\n  These changes in the committee bill, a bill which was approved on a \nbipartisan basis in our committee, the changes that appear in the bill \nwhich is now before us, taken together, will put our own troops at risk \nif other countries decide to apply similar standards to our troops if \nthey are captured and detained. These changes in the bill before us \nfrom the committee bill are likely to result in the reversal of \nconvictions on appeal, and that means that efforts to convict these \npeople of crimes can be readily reversed on appeal because of the \nchanges that were made in the committee bill and the fact, which seems \nto me to be quite clear, that they do not comply in many instances with \nthe requirements set forth in Hamdan, and the changes in the bill \nbefore us from the committee bill are inconsistent with American \nvalues.\n  I particularly again highlight the search and seizure requirements of \nour fourth amendment and the way that seems to be abandoned in the bill \nbefore us.\n  I close by applauding, again, Senators Warner, McCain, and Graham for \ntheir willingness to stand up to the administration and at least at the \nArmed Services Committee produce a bill that we were able to approve in \nthe Armed Services Committee on a strong bipartisan vote.\n  However, the administration has been even more relentless in their \neffort to legitimize the mistreatment of detainees and to undermine \nsome of the cornerstone principles of our legal system. While the bill \nbefore us is a modest improvement over the language originally proposed \nby the administration, it has adopted far too many provisions from the \nadministration's bill. The substitute which we will be offering later \non today is the committee-approved bill. That will do a much better \njob, if we adopt it, of protecting our troops who might become \ndetainees in the future and does a much better job of upholding our \nvalues as a nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? If no one yields time, time \nwill be charged to both sides.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that of the time \nunder the control of the Democratic leader, Senator Reid, that 45 \nminutes be allocated to Senator Leahy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask that the time be \ncharged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Parliamentary inquiry: At this time the Senate is now \nproceeding on the Hamdi bill; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the Military \nCommissions Act of 2006 which would authorize military commissions for \nthe trial of an alien enemy unlawful combatant.\n  I take a moment to say my colleagues and others with whom I have \nserved in the Senate the last 28 years stand at a moment of critical \nimportance in the history of our Nation. What we do today will impact \nhow we conduct the war on terror for as long as it lasts. In the \nestimate of this humble Senator, that could be for decades. It will \nfundamentally impact our relationships with our allies. It will \nfundamentally impact the image of the United States of America in the \neyes of the world. It is crucial to our ability to keep America safe. \nIt will speak most loudly about the core values, the principles of this \ngreat Republic known as the United States of America.\n  From the outset, I make it clear I respect the views of all \nparticipants in this dialog, from the President and his team, to those \nparticularly in the Congress, but elsewhere in the Congress, on both \nsides of the aisle. I have certain core principles I share with several \nof my colleagues. I have endeavored to see this particular bill \nreflects those principles to the best of my ability, as have they. \nNevertheless, I respect the views of others who may differ.\n  The goal of this legislation, from my point of view, and I think it \nis shared by others, is first and foremost to meet the challenge for \nwithstanding review by the Supreme Court. Out of respect for that \nCourt, the Hamdi decision, which was quite an interesting decision in \nmany of its findings, divided by different panels within that Court, it \nis quite likely in one or more instances, if this becomes law, the bill \nnow presently before the Senate, that will likewise be taken to the \nSupreme Court. That is the way we do things in the United States of \nAmerica.\n  We hope we who have labored to craft this, and the 100 Senators who \nwill finally cast their votes, together with the other body, will give \nto the President a bill that will effectively enable him to do those \nthings to keep America free, to fight the war on terrorism and, at the \nsame time, pass the Federal court review--whether it is the district, \nappellate, or the Supreme Court--such as likely will take place.\n  In late June, the Supreme Court struck down the President's initial \nplan to try detainees by military commissions. In its opinion, Hamdi v. \nRumsfeld, the Court held by a fractured five-Justice panel that the \npresent system for trials by military commission violated both the \nUniform Code of Military Justice and particularly Common Article 3 of \nthe 1949 Geneva Conventions. There were some four conventions put \ntogether in 1949. In particular, the Common Article 3 was common to all \nfour of those conventions.\n  That historic moment in world history was a culmination from the \nlearning experience of what took place all across our globe during \nWorld War II in an effort to see that certain injustices, in terms of \nthe basic core values of the free world, would never occur again.\n  It is my fervent hope and conviction that whatever the Congress does, \nthe\n\n[[Page S10246]]\n\nlegislation we produce must be able to withstand further security \nreview and scrutiny of the Federal court system, particularly the \nSupreme Court.\n  From my own personal perspective, it would be a very serious blow to \nthe credibility of the United States--and I have said this a number of \ntimes in connection with the debate--not only in the international \ncommunity but also at home, if the legislation as prepared by the \nCongress now and enacted by the President failed to meet another series \nof Federal court reviews.\n  To meet the mandate of the Court in its decision, Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, \nthis legislation provides for a military commission that, in the words \nof Common Article 3, affords ``all the judicial guarantees which are \nrecognized as indispensable by civilized peoples.''\n  That is what we are striving to obtain. The Military Commissions Act \nof 2006 provides these essential guarantees in the following ways. The \nbill generally follows the current military rule on the use of \nclassified information at trial. That has been an area of concern \nprobably to each and every Senator but most particularly to this \nSenator and others who worked closely in our group. We have, to the \nsatisfaction of all interested parties, resolved that.\n  That is a very fundamental thing we must maintain; that is, the \nability of our continued gathering of evidence, the protection of \nsource and methods--nevertheless, to provide, on a real-time basis \nintelligence for our fighting men and women and, indeed, intelligence \nto protect us here at home.\n  However, our bill goes further by creating a privilege that protects \nclassified information at all stages of a trial and prohibits \ndisclosure of classified information, including sensitive intelligence \nsources and methods, to an alleged terrorist accused.\n  As a fundamental matter--and one we feel is crucial for this bill to \nsurvive judicial review--the bill would not allow an accused, however, \nto be tried and sentenced--perhaps even being given the death penalty--\non evidence that the accused has never been allowed to see. That, in my \njudgment, and I think in the judgment of many, would be establishing a \nprecedent that is without foundation in American jurisprudence or, \nindeed, the jurisprudence of the vast majority of nations in the world.\n  Further, the bill would prohibit the use of evidence that was \nallegedly obtained through the use of torture. A statement obtained \nbefore the date of enactment of the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005--\nDecember 30, 2005--in which the degree of coercion is in dispute could \nbe used only--and I repeat--only at trial if the military judge finds \nthat it is reliable and tends to prove the point for which it was \noffered.\n  A statement obtained after the date of enactment of the Detainee \nTreatment Act of 2005, in which the degree of coercion is in dispute, \nmay only be admitted in evidence if the military judge finds that the \nfirst two tests are met and finds that the interrogation methods used \nto obtain the statement do not amount to cruel, inhuman, or degrading \ntreatment prohibited by the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005.\n  The bill would generally follow the rules of evidence that apply to \ncourts-martial. However, the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with \nthe Attorney General, would be authorized to make substantial \nexceptions due to the unique circumstances presented by the conduct of \nmilitary and intelligence activities so long as those exceptions are \nnot inconsistent with the statutory provisions provided by this new \nlaw.\n  Most importantly, this bill achieves the President's benchmark \nobjective by clearly defining those grave breaches of Common Article 3 \nof the Geneva Conventions that would be a criminal offense under the \nU.S. domestic law in the War Crimes Act.\n  That term, ``grave breaches,'' is set forth in that Convention of \n1949. And in conjunction with working on this, we extensively examined \nthe legislative history. Doing so allows our military and intelligence \ninterrogators to know what conduct is prohibited under U.S. law. \nMoreover, this bill provides that no foreign sources of law may be used \nto define or interpret U.S. domestic criminal law implementing Common \nArticle 3.\n  This bill does not provide as a matter of law that this legislation \nfully satisfies Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions. My \ncolleagues and I feel that to make such a statement a matter of statute \nwould amount to a reinterpretation of our obligations under the Geneva \nConventions some 57 years after the United States signed those \ntreaties. Such an action could open the door to statutory \nreinterpretation by a host of other nations with less regard for human \nrights than the United States, and would result in possibly our U.S. \ntroops being put at greater risk should they become captives in a \nfuture conflict.\n  However, in addition to clearly defining grave breaches of Common \nArticle 3 that are war crimes under the War Crimes Act, this bill \nacknowledges the President's authority under the Constitution to \ninterpret the meaning and application of the Geneva Conventions, and to \npromulgate administrative regulations for violations of our broader \ntreaty obligations which are not grave breaches of the Geneva \nConventions. To ensure transparency, such interpretations are required \nto be published in the Federal Register and are subject to \ncongressional and judicial oversight.\n  We have had a robust discussion of these issues among Members and \nwith administration officials for some several months, most \nparticularly the last few weeks. I strongly believe this bill achieves \nthe best balance for our country. It will allow terrorists to be \nbrought to justice in accordance with the founding principles and \nvalues that have made our Nation the greatest democracy in the world.\n  This bill will also provide the clarity needed to allow our essential \nintelligence activities to go forward--I repeat: go forward--under the \nlaw. And this bill is consistent with the Geneva Conventions, which \nhave helped protect our own forces in conflicts over the past 57 years.\n  I thank my colleagues for their support. I wish at this time to thank \nthe many staff members who have worked on this thing tirelessly. And I \nmight add, in my 28 years here I have never known the legislative \ncounsel's office to literally work 24 hours around the clock. Perhaps \nthey have, but certainly they did in this instance. I want to give a \nspecial recognition and thanks to that office for assisting the Senate \nin preparing this bill.\n  Now, Mr. President, my understanding is the Senator from Michigan may \nwell have an amendment he would like to bring forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5086\n\n       (Purpose: In the nature of a substitute)\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I now call up amendment No. 5086, which is \nan amendment in the nature of a substitute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 5086.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the amendment which I have just called up \nwould substitute a bill which was adopted by the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee on a bipartisan vote of 15 to 9 for the pending language.\n  Before I outline the differences between the bill which the committee \nadopted and the bill before us, I want to thank my good friend from \nVirginia for the work he and a number of other colleagues on the \nRepublican side put into the committee bill to make it possible for \nthat bill to be adopted.\n  In my earlier statement, when the Senator was not on the floor, I \ncommended him and Senator McCain and Senator Graham for their effort \nearlier this month to produce a military commissions bill that would \nprotect our troops in the event they were captured at some point down \nthe road that would withstand judicial review and be consistent with \nour values.\n  They produced this bill in the committee, despite huge administration \nopposition. The chairman of the committee actually scheduled a markup, \nas I indicated in my prior statement, despite the opposition of the \nadministration. The administration did then and\n\n[[Page S10247]]\n\ncontinues to want to permit the treatment of prisoners which is \nabusive. They did then and they still want to allow criminal \nconvictions to be based on secret evidence.\n  But what the chairman and a number of other Republican Senators were \nable to do was to make some accomplishments in those two areas: in the \narea of secret evidence, and in the area, to an extent, of coercive \nstatements, statements that were obtained by coercion, depending on \nwhen the statement was obtained. I will get into that in greater detail \nbecause there is a distinction in the bill that is on the floor now as \nto whether the statement was obtained before or after December 30, \n2005, as to whether certain types of coercive treatment would be \nallowed and that statement, nonetheless, be admitted into evidence. I \nthink that distinction between a statement obtained by coercion before \nor after December 30, 2005, is a distinction which is totally \nunsustainable. But I will get into that again in a moment.\n  But before I begin, because my friend, Senator Graham, who is also on \nthe floor now, and my friend from Virginia were not on the floor \nbefore--before I list a number of major differences with the pending \nbill that I and a number of others have with the pending bill--I want \nto again compliment my good friend from Virginia, Senator McCain, and \nSenator Graham because they had to withstand a huge amount of \nadministration pressure to get the bill out of committee. It is a far \nbetter bill than the one which is now before us. That is why I am going \nto attempt to substitute it for the bill that is now before us. But, \nnonetheless, their effort has produced some significant gains over the \nadministration language. I acknowledge that and I thank them for that \neffort before I proceed to offer the committee bill that is a \nsubstitute.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, will the Senator kindly yield for me to \naddress his comments?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am happy to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Senator has recited that our committee \nhad a markup on a bill. That was after receiving from the \nadministration its own bill. So in a sense, the Senate had before it \ntwo bills. Perhaps the formalities I will not go into. But the Senate \nhad the administration's bill and the draft of the committee bill at \nthe time we went into the markup.\n  The Senator referred to the administration's huge pressure, but those \nare matters we can go into at another time. But I want you to know the \ngroup I was working with, and other Senators, were working with the \nadministration right up until the hours before the markup started.\n  As the Senator proceeds with his amendment, I am going to ask that \nthe Senator from South Carolina, at the conclusion of your remarks on \nthe amendment, be recognized for the purpose of giving his statement \nwhich, indeed, addresses the current bill in the context of the bill \nthat was drafted by the committee, as I understand it from the Senator \nfrom South Carolina. And then we will proceed further with discussion \non your bill.\n  We have 3 hours to consider matters here. But I point out, we have \nyour substitute bill, which is basically a 60-minute proposition; the \nRockefeller congressional oversight, which is 60 minutes; the Kennedy \ninterrogation, which is 60 minutes; the Byrd sunset which is 60 \nminutes; and the Specter-Leahy habeas corpus--and I expect you might be \na part of that habeas corpus amendment--which is 120 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator will yield?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Without losing his right to--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The time limit on the substitute amendment is also 120 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes, correct. I don't know if I stated that, but it \nshould be here as a part of it.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield, without losing his right to the \nfloor?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. My understanding is the Senator from Vermont has an hour \nreserved on the bill, with up to 45 minutes of that on the Specter-\nLeahy habeas amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would have to inquire of the Chair if \nthe Chair has knowledge of that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is not part of the agreement.\n  Mr. WARNER. Does the Senator from Michigan wish to address that \nrequest?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I know that I did ask unanimous consent to protect the \nSenator from Vermont for 45 minutes on the habeas amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is correct. Under \nthe consent agreement, 45 minutes has been reserved to the Senator from \nVermont out of the leadership time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is on the bill itself. And on the habeas amendment, \nthat would be up to you and Senator Specter--right?--to control.\n  Mr. LEAHY. No. Mr. President, I am confused by this. It was my \nunderstanding the Senator from Vermont had up to 45 minutes \nspecifically reserved, not from anybody else's time, but from his own \ntime, on the Specter-Leahy, et al., amendment, and a total--out of \nwhich the 45 minutes would have to come--of 1 hour on the bill. Is that \nincorrect?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would suggest the following to work our \nway through this: I call on the Chair to inform the Senate as to the \ntime agreement which I understand has been agreed upon by our leaders.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there is to be 2 \nhours equally divided for the Levin amendment, 2 hours equally divided \nfor the Specter amendment on habeas, 1 hour equally divided on the \nRockefeller, Kennedy, Byrd amendments each; general debate is 3 hours \nequally divided, 90 minutes on each side, of which 45 minutes on the \nminority side had been allocated to the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. WARNER. At this time, I advise my colleagues that I would oppose \nany change to that unanimous consent and ask any Members who so desire \nto address the UC to do so to their respective leadership.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The senior Senator from Virginia has an absolute right to \nobject to anything further. This is not what I understood had been \nagreed to. It is the unanimous consent that the Chair has so stated. I \nwill not seek to change it. I don't suggest that it is the fault of the \nSenator from Virginia. This is not what I understood the agreement to \nbe.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the senior Senator from Connecticut, Mr. \nDodd, be added as an original cosponsor to the Specter-Leahy habeas \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Virginia controls the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Do I see another Senator wishing to speak?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be added as an \noriginal cosponsor to the Specter-Leahy-Dodd amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I will yield the floor, and the Senator \nfrom Michigan will regain his right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, on September 14, the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee favorably reported S. 3901, the Military Commissions Act of \n2006, to the Senate floor with a bipartisan vote of 15 to 9. Supporters \nof the committee bill on both sides of the aisle emphasized that the \nbill met two critical tests:\n  First, that we would be able to live with the procedures we \nestablished if the tables are turned and our own troops were subject to \nsimilar procedures.\n  Second, that the bill was consistent with our American system of \njustice and would stand up to scrutiny on judicial review.\n  On the first point, the committee bill did not authorize departure \nfrom the requirements of the Geneva Conventions, did not authorize the \nabuse of prisoners in U.S. custody, did not authorize the use of \ntestimony obtained\n\n[[Page S10248]]\n\nthrough abusive practices, because the standards for detention, \ninterrogation, and trial in the bill were consistent with international \nnorms. The bill contained no procedures that we could not live with if \nthey were applied to our own troops who might be captured at some \nfuture time.\n  On the second point, the committee bill established legal procedures \nconsistent with basic principles of the American system of justice, \nsuch as the right to examine and respond to all evidence presented, and \nthe exclusion of unreliable categories of evidence, such as coerced \nstatements. Because the bill took the approach outlined by the Supreme \nCourt in the Hamdan case, a trial process based on rules and procedures \napplicable in trials by courts martial, subject to such exceptions as \nmight be required by the unique circumstances of military and \nintelligence operations in an ongoing conflict, committee members could \nhave confidence that these provisions would be upheld by the courts on \nappeal.\n  The committee bill was not brought to the Senate floor. Indeed, the \nmajority leader reacted to the action of the Armed Services Committee \nby telling the press he would filibuster the bill if the Senate Armed \nServices Committee bill was brought to the Senate floor. Consequently, \nthe three Republican Senators who had drafted the committee bill, \nSenators Warner, McCain, and Graham, entered into negotiations with an \nadministration that has been unrelenting in its determination to \nlegitimize the abuse of detainees and to distort military commission \nprocedures to ensure convictions.\n  The bill before us, which is the product of those negotiations, has \nbeen changed from the committee bill in so many ways that the bill is a \nvery different bill from the one that was adopted by the Armed Services \nCommittee. It is the Armed Services Committee bipartisan bill that I \nhave now offered as a substitute to this new version that is being \noffered today.\n  Let me give you some examples of the differences between the \ncommittee-adopted bill and the bill that is before us. On coerced \ntestimony, the committee bill prohibited the admission of statements \nobtained through cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment. The bill \nbefore us prohibits the admission of statements obtained after December \n30, 2005, through ``cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment'' but \ninexplicably contained no such prohibition for such statements that \nwere obtained before December 30, 2005.\n  As a result, military tribunals would presumably be free to admit, \nfor the first time in U.S. legal history, statements that were \nextracted through cruel or inhuman practices.\n\n  By the way, on that issue, if anybody wants to read the actual \ndifference in the way in which the December 30, 2005, date was provided \nin this bill as a dividing line between statements that could be \nadmitted into evidence, although they were obtained through cruel and \ninhuman treatment, they can refer to sections 948(R)(c), on a statement \nobtained before December 30, 2005, the date of the enactment of the \nDetainee Treatment Act of 2005, which says:\n\n       The degree of coercion in dispute may be admitted if the \n     military judge finds the following: Totality of the \n     circumstances renders the statement reliable in possessing \n     sufficient probative value; and, 2, the interest of justice \n     would best be served by the admission of the statement into \n     evidence.\n\n  But subsection (d) reads:\n\n       If the statement is obtained after December 30, 2005, the \n     date of the enactment of the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005, \n     the degree of coercion may be disputed and may be admitted \n     under those same two circumstances.\n\n  It then adds a third finding that is required:\n\n       That the interrogation methods used to obtain the statement \n     do not amount to cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment, \n     prohibited by section 1003.\n\n  So if the statement is obtained after December 30, 2005, then if it \nis obtained through cruel and inhuman treatment, it is not allowable \ninto evidence. But because that requirement is missing relative to \nstatements obtained prior to December 30, 2005, presumably, even though \na statement is obtained through cruel and inhuman treatment, it is \nnonetheless admissible into evidence if it meets the other two tests \nprovided. That is an unsustainable provision. It would be the first \ntime in American legal history that we would, in effect, be authorizing \nstatements that were obtained through that type of coercion--cruel \ntreatment, inhuman treatment--to be admitted into evidence. That is \nsomething we should not accept.\n  On the issue of hearsay, the committee bill permitted the admission \nof hearsay not admissible at trials by court-martial if direct \nevidence, which is inherently more probative, could be procured \n``through reasonable efforts,'' taking into consideration the unique \ncircumstances of the conduct of military and intelligence operations \nduring hostilities.\n  The bill before us, unlike the committee bill, makes hearsay evidence \nadmissible, unless the defendant can demonstrate that it is unreliable \nor lacking in probative value. Well, hearsay evidence is not only \ninherently unreliable, it is used to deprive the accused of the ability \nto confront the witnesses against him.\n  The approach taken by this bill not only relieves the Government of \nany obligation to seek direct testimony from its witnesses, it also \nappears to shift the burden to the accused by presuming that hearsay \nevidence is reliable, unless the accused can demonstrate otherwise.\n  Relative to search warrants, the committee bill provided that \nevidence seized outside of the United States shall not be excluded from \ntrial by military commission on the grounds that the evidence was not \nseized pursuant to a search warrant. The bill before us deletes the \nlimitation to evidence seized outside of the United States. As a \nresult, the bill authorizes the use of evidence that is seized inside \nthe United States without a search warrant. I note that the chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee is on the floor. I particularly point out this \nprovision to him--that because the words ``outside of the United \nStates'' were deleted, the bill before us would allow into evidence, \nfor the first time in history, I believe--it authorizes the use of \nevidence seized inside the United States without a search warrant. It \nis not limited to evidence seized from enemy combatants. It does not \neven preclude the seizure of evidence without a warrant from U.S. \ncitizens. That is a major departure from the committee-adopted bill. It \nwould appear to authorize the use of evidence obtained without a \nwarrant, in violation of the United States Constitution.\n  The next problem I want to address is the definition of ``unlawful \ncombatant.'' The committee bill defines the term ``unlawful combatant'' \nin accordance with the traditional law of war. The bill before us \nchanges the definition to add a presumption that any person who is \n``part of'' the associated forces of a terrorist organization is an \nunlawful combatant, regardless of whether that person actually meets \nthe test of engaging in hostilities against the United States or \npurposefully and materially supporting such hostility.\n  In addition, the bill also adds a new provision which makes the \ndetermination of a Combatant Status Review Tribunal, CSRT, that a \nperson is an unlawful enemy combatant, dispositive for the purpose of \nthe jurisdiction of a military commission, even though CSRT \ndeterminations may be based on evidence that would be excluded as \nunreliable by a military commission.\n  We should not make those findings dispositive, particularly where the \nCSRT findings can be based on such very unreliable evidence.\n  Next is procedures and rules of evidence. The committee bill provided \nthat the procedures and rules of evidence applicable in trials by \ngeneral courts-martial would apply in trials by military commissions, \nsubject to such exceptions as the Secretary of Defense determines to be \n``required by the unique circumstances of the conduct of military and \nintelligence operations during hostilities or by other practical \nneed.''\n  So the committee bill starts with the courts-martial, the manual, and \nthen says that the Secretary of Defense may make such exceptions as he \ndetermines are ``required by the unique circumstances of the conduct of \nmilitary and intelligence operations or by practical need.''\n  This approach is consistent with the ruling in Hamdan. It builds in \nsome flexibility to address unique circumstances arising out of \nmilitary and\n\n[[Page S10249]]\n\nintelligence operations. The bill before us reverses the presumption, \nand instead of starting with the rules applicable in trials by court-\nmartial and establishing exceptions, the Secretary of Defense is \nrequired to make trials by commission consistent with those rules only \nwhen he considers it practicable to do so. As one observer has pointed \nout, this provision is now so vaguely worded that it could even be read \nto authorize the administration to abandon the presumption of innocence \nin trials by military commission.\n  On the issue of habeas corpus, the habeas corpus provision in the \ncommittee bill stripped alien detainees of habeas corpus rights, even \nif they have no other legal recourse to demonstrate that they were \nimproperly detained. It also stripped those detainees of any other \nrecourse to U.S. courts for legal actions regarding their detention or \ntreatment in U.S. custody.\n  If the substitute amendment we are offering is approved, a further \namendment will be necessary to address the obvious problems with the \ncommittee habeas corpus amendment. That habeas corpus amendment is \ngoing to be offered in either event, whether or not the bill before us \nremains or whether or not the committee bill is substituted for it. But \nat least in the committee bill, the court-stripping provision was \nlimited to aliens who were detained outside the United States. The bill \nbefore us expands that provision to eliminate habeas corpus rights and \nall other legal rights of redress for wrongs committed by aliens, \nincluding lawful permanent residents detained inside or outside the \nUnited States who have been determined by the United States to be \nenemies.\n  The only requirement under the bill before us is that the Government \ndetermines that the alien detainee is an enemy combatant, but the bill \nprovides no standard for this determination and offers the detainee no \nability to challenge it. Consequently, even aliens who have been \nreleased from U.S. custody, such as the detainee that the Canadian \nGovernment recently found was detained without any basis and subjected \nto torture, even those kinds of aliens, such as that Canadian citizen, \nwould be denied any legal recourse as long as the United States \ncontinues to claim in a way which cannot be contested that they were \nproperly held.\n  No matter how overwhelming the evidence, there is no way to contest \nit, and there is no legal recourse under the bill before us. That was \nnot true of the committee bill.\n  The committee bill had lots of problems, in my judgment, on habeas \ncorpus, but the bill before us, for the reasons I just outlined, goes \nway beyond what the committee bill provided.\n  As a result of these changes, the bill that is before us does not \nmeet either of the two tests used by the majority of members at the \nArmed Services Committee markup. The two tests that are not met: The \nbill before us places our own troops at risk if others apply similar \nstandards, and it is likely to result in convictions by military \ncommissions that are overturned on appeal.\n  For example, the provision in the bill addressing coerced testimony \nwould prohibit the use of statements that are obtained through cruel \nand inhuman treatment if those statements were obtained after December \n30, 2005, but again, it inexplicably contains no such prohibition on \nstatements obtained through those same methods prior to this date. This \nprovision, in other words, expressly authorizes military commissions to \nconsider evidence that was obtained through cruel and inhuman treatment \nof defendants and other witnesses.\n  By expressly omitting the principle that statements obtained through \ncruel and inhuman treatment of detainees should be precluded from \nevidence--even if they were obtained before December 30, 2005--this \nprovision would set an absolutely unacceptable and frightening standard \nif the rest of the world adopts this same standard. This is a standard \nunder which our own troops could be subjected to abuse and mistreatment \nof all kinds in order to force them to sign statements that would then \nbe used to convict them of war crimes.\n\n  The provision also sets a standard which will be used by our \nterrorist enemies as evidence of U.S. hypocrisy when it comes to \nproclamations of human rights. Our failure to conclusively exclude \nstatements obtained through cruel and inhuman methods are all too \nlikely to be seen through much of the world as a confirmation of \nnegative views of Americans and what we stand for and that have been \nshaped by their views of what happened at Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo.\n  The administration and its supporters have argued that our military \njudges can be counted on to exclude statements that are based on \nextreme forms of abuse. That may be; that may be. We have many fine \nmilitary judges, and I share the hope that these judges will be willing \nto stand up for the humane treatment of detainees, even where Congress \nhas failed to do so and even when the administration is unwilling to do \nso.\n  Indeed, our top military lawyers have told us that evidence obtained \nthrough coercive techniques is inherently unreliable. The Army Deputy \nChief of Staff for Intelligence, LTG John Kimmons, said the same thing \nwhen he released the new Army Field Manual on interrogation procedures. \nHe stated:\n\n       No good intelligence is going to come from abusive \n     practice. I think history tells us that. I think the \n     empirical evidence of the last five years, hard years, tell \n     us that. And moreover, any piece of intelligence which is \n     obtained under duress . . . through the use of abusive \n     techniques would be of questionable credibility.\n\n  I am hopeful that our military judges will likewise reject testimony \nthat is obtained through abusive techniques as inherently unreliable \nand of questionable credibility.\n  However, our military judges cannot protect our troops in future \nconflicts. If an American soldier, sailor, airman, or marine is put on \ntrial by a hostile power, he or she will not have an American military \njudge to stand up for his or her rights. Our troops will face foreign \njudges, and if the standard applied by those judges is similar to the \none proposed in this bill for statements obtained prior to December 30, \n2005, they are a lot less likely to get either fair treatment or fair \ntrials.\n  If statements obtained through cruel and inhuman treatment of \ndetainees are allowed into evidence, as this provision provides, any \nresulting convictions are unlikely to withstand scrutiny on judicial \nreview in our own courts.\n  The Supreme Court specifically addressed this issue in the Hamdan \ncase earlier this year. In that case, the Court pointed out that Common \nArticle 3 of the Geneva Conventions prohibits the passing of sentences \n``without previous judgment pronounced by a regularly constituted court \naffording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as \nindispensable by civilized peoples.''\n  The Supreme Court concluded that ``[t]he regular military courts in \nour system are the courts-martial established by congressional \nstatutes'' and ``can be `regularly constituted' by the standards of our \nmilitary justice system only if some practical need explains deviations \nfrom court-martial practice''; and the language requiring ``judicial \nguarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples'' \nmust require, at a minimum, that any deviation from procedures \ngoverning courts-martial be justified by ``evident practical need.''\n  The rules of evidence reviewed by the Supreme Court in the Hamdan \ncase, such as the rules we are considering today, would have permitted \nthe admission of statements obtained through coercion--other than \ntorture--into evidence if a military commission determines the \nstatements to be probative and reliable. The plurality opinion of the \nCourt notes that under these procedures, ``evidence obtained through \ncoercion [is] fully admissible.'' Similarly, Justice Kennedy's \nconcurring opinion observes that the procedures in place ``make no \nprovision for exclusion of coerced declarations save those `established \nto have been made as a result of torture.' ''\n  The Supreme Court expressly rejected those procedures. The procedures \nestablished by the President, according to the Supreme Court, ``deviate \nfrom those governing courts-martial in ways not justified by any \n`evident practical need,' and for that reason, at least, fail to afford \nthe requisite guarantees'' that are recognized as indispensable by \ncivilized peoples.\n  Like the procedures previously rejected by the Supreme Court, this \nbill\n\n[[Page S10250]]\n\nwould make evidence obtained through coercion, other than torture, \nadmissible, at least in the case of evidence obtained prior to December \n30, 2005. Given that the Supreme Court has already struck down \nprocedures that similarly failed to preclude coerced testimony once, it \nis surely likely that the Court will strike them down again. Whatever \nminimal due process may be required in the case of an alien enemy \ncombatant, it certainly cannot be met by procedures that, as a majority \nof the Supreme Court has already determined, fail to provide the \n``judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by \ncivilized people.''\n  We should also reject this provision because it is inconsistent with \nAmerican values and what we stand for as a nation. During the \nRevolutionary War, the British mistreated many American prisoners. But \nas described by David Hackett Fischer in his book ``Washington's \nCrossing,'' General Washington ``ordered that . . . the captives would \nbe treated as human beings with the same rights of humanity for which \nAmericans were striving,'' and those ``moral choices in the War of \nIndependence enlarged the meaning of the American Revolution.''\n  We have always believed that we hold ourselves to a higher standard \nthan many other nations. Others may abuse prisoners; we do not. Others \nmay engage in cruel and inhuman practices; we do not. Others may \nbelieve that the ends justify the means; we do not. It is contrary to \nwhat we stand for as a nation.\n  Former Navy general counsel Alberto Mora bravely fought against \nefforts by others in this administration to approve cruel and inhuman \ninterrogation techniques. Mr. Mora explained his stand when he was \nawarded the 2006 John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award on May 22. He \nsaid:\n\n       We need to be clear. Cruelty disfigures our national \n     character. It is incompatible with our constitutional order, \n     with our laws, and with our most prized values. Cruelty can \n     be as effective as torture in destroying human dignity, \n     and there is no moral distinction between one and the \n     other. To adopt and apply a policy of cruelty anywhere \n     within this world is to say that our forefathers were \n     wrong about their belief in the rights of man because \n     there is no more fundamental right than to be safe from \n     cruel and inhuman treatment. Where cruelty exists, law \n     does not.\n\n  If we enact this provision into law, giving a congressional stamp of \napproval to the use of cruel and inhuman methods to extract testimony \nfrom detainees, we will diminish ourselves as a people and, as Colin \nPowell stated in a recent letter to Senator McCain, add to the world's \ndoubts about the moral basis of our fight against terrorism.\n  The bill, as reported by the Armed Services Committee, will protect \nour troops, will be more likely to result in convictions that are \nupheld on appeal, and will be more in keeping with our values as a \nnation. That bill allows for interrogation, it allows for detention, it \nallows for prosecution, and it allows for conviction.\n  The issue isn't whether we interrogate or detain people. We are going \nto do it. We need to do it. The question is whether we do it in a way \nwhich is in keeping with our values, which is in keeping with rules we \nhave established in the Army manual, for instance, for the treatment of \npeople who are captured by our Army. It is whether we do it in a way \nthat is in keeping with what we would insist others follow if they \ncapture our people, what we insist upon in the committee substitute--\nthat committee bill which we adopted on a bipartisan basis--our \nstandards and rules for which we will argue if our people are captured \nor detained by others.\n  We cannot make the distinction this bill before us makes--that cruel \nand inhuman treatment which leads to a statement or confession is not \ngoing to be the basis for excluding a statement if that statement is \nmade before December 30, 2005. Only after December 30, 2005, are \nstatements excluded where they are the product of cruel and inhuman \ntreatment. But before December 30, 2005, according to the bill in front \nof us now, those statements are not excluded unless they meet two other \ntests. We have to be very clear on this issue. After December 30, 2005, \nany of three tests, if met, will result in the exclusion of those \nstatements but not before December 30, 2005, when we know as a fact \nthat so much of the abuse took place.\n  So I urge our colleagues to support the substitute amendment. Again, \nI wish to make clear that this substitute amendment is the Senate Armed \nServices Committee bill which the chairman and others labored so hard \nto produce. It is a bill which avoids many of the pitfalls of the bill \nthat is before us. I hope our colleagues will vote to substitute that \nbill for the pending language.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). Twenty-four minutes 10 seconds.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I was particularly taken by Senator \nLevin's reference to General Washington and what General Washington \nsaid with regard to prisoners. But we must be mindful that General \nWashington was facing the King's Army. Those were uniformed \nindividuals. Those were individuals acting on behalf of the Crown. That \nis totally different--totally different--from what we as a nation and \nmany other nations today are facing with these terrorists.\n  Consequently, as a part of the evolution of this extraordinary \nproliferation of terrorism across the world has come the definitions \nand terms relating to the unlawful enemy combatant--I repeat, \nunlawful--because those individuals are not wearing uniforms, they are \nnot following any code of laws or conduct that has overseen much of \nwarfare in the history of the world. They are not affiliated with any \nstate. They are driven, in my judgment, by convictions, much of it \nreligious convictions which are totally antithetical to their own \nreligion, and willing to sacrifice their own lives to foster their \nambitions and goals.\n  We expanded this definition of ``unlawful enemy combatant'' when we \nwent from the committee bill to a bill that was worked on by, again, \nSenator McCain, Senator Graham, and myself, and in conjunction with the \nWhite House and our leadership and other colleagues.\n  It was pointed out to us that perhaps our bill is drawn so narrowly \nthat we would not be able to get evidence and support convictions from \nthose who are involved in hiding in the safe houses, wherever they are \nin the world, including here in the United States.\n  It is wrong to say that this provision captures any U.S. citizens. It \ndoes not. It is only directed at aliens--aliens, not U.S. citizens--\nbomb-makers, wherever they are in the world; those who provide the \nmoney to carry out the terrorism, wherever they are--again, only aliens \nand those who are preparing and using so many false documents.\n  There were a lot of categories which we, with the best of intentions, \nperhaps did not fully comprehend when we were working through that \nmarkup session. So at this time, I yield the floor because I see my \ndistinguished colleague from South Carolina. I thank the Senator. He is \nrecognized for his knowledge as an officer in the U.S. Air Force, a \ncolonel who has practiced and studied military law for many years, and \nwe are fortunate to have had his services and continue to have them in \naddressing this legislation.\n  I would also point out to my colleagues that Senator McCain, who \nworked with us throughout this process, is away attending a funeral of \na very dear and valued colleague, and he will be returning later this \nafternoon and will be fully engaged from that point on.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I yield such time as he may consume to the \nSenator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like to return the compliment that \nSenator Levin gave to myself, Senator McCain, and Senator Warner. I \nhave found Senator Levin and his staff to be very good to work with. \nSometimes we reach agreement and sometimes we don't, but all the time \nwe try. As to my staff, I appreciate the tons of time they have spent \ntrying to give us the best product we can get in the legislative \nprocess that will adhere to our values and allow the war effort to move \nforward in an effective way.\n  As to the difference between the committee bill, which we wrote and \nsupported, and the compromise we reached\n\n[[Page S10251]]\n\nwith the White House, which we wrote and support, there are some \ndifferences. I think some of them we have addressed with Senator \nLevin's staff. They were very helpful. He found some language which was \ndropped inadvertently which made the bill stronger.\n  I would just like to suggest that whatever military experience I have \nhad pales in comparison to the men and women who are in charge of \ntoday's military legal system. I am a reservist. I come in and out of \nmilitary law. I spent 6\\1/2\\ years on active duty, and I really enjoyed \nmy time. I dealt a lot in the court-martial process as a prosecutor and \na defense attorney. But as a reservist and Guard member, it has been a \npart-time job. But those who do this full time supported the \nadministration's proposal when it came to the admission of evidence by \nthe military judge. I will, at an appropriate time, introduce that into \nthe Record.\n  I believe the JAGs are a good source of advice. That doesn't mean \nthey are the only source of advice. That doesn't mean that because the \nJudge Advocate Generals of all four branches say so, we need to do what \nthey say. It would be wise to just listen, and I have tried to listen. \nSometimes I agree; sometimes I don't. But they have said unanimously, \nit is my understanding, that the evidentiary standards in terms of \nadmission of evidence, where the judge will determine whether the \nevidence is reliable and probative using the totality of circumstances \nto create justice, was a sufficient legal standard, and they were \nsupportive of that standard. So this idea that we are going to allow \ncoerced evidence into a trial purposely, that we made a conscious \ndecision from the committee bill to the compromise to change course and \ntake everything we had said before and just throw it over in a ditch, \nquite honestly, makes no sense.\n  Whatever motives you would like to attribute to the effort here, I \ncan assure my colleagues I want to create a process that would be \nacceptable if our troops found themselves subject to it. And every \nmilitary Judge Advocate, every admiral, and every general, believes the \nevidentiary standard in this committee bill is legally acceptable and \nappropriate.\n  Why the difference between December 30, 2005, and before? The reason \nwe have a two-tiered system is because in 2005, due to the hard work of \nSenator McCain and Senator Levin--who was a champion in trying to bring \nthis about on the Democratic side--we were able to make a policy \nstatement of the United States that says: Cruel and inhumane and \ndegrading treatment as a policy will be forbidden. And we referenced \nthe 5th, 8th, and 14th amendments standard called ``shock the \nconscience'' that existed in the convention on torture. All bills have \nexcluded evidence that violates the torture statute. It is a per se \nexclusion. If the military judge, in their discretion, believes that \nthe conduct in front of the court amounts to torture, in violation of \nthe torture statute, it does not come into evidence.\n  The committee bill had a per se exclusion for a violation of the \nDetainee Treatment Act, and it has been changed, and here is why: The \nDetainee Treatment Act is a policy statement, not an evidentiary \nstandard. The Detainee Treatment Act says that the Government and its \nagents and agencies will not engage in cruel, inhumane, and degrading \ntreatment. I would argue that to exclude evidence in a military \ncommission that may run afoul of degrading treatment would create a \nhigher standard for a terrorist than our own military members have in \ntheir own courts-martial. So I think the policy statement ``cruel and \ninhumane and degrading'' should not be an evidentiary standard, and it \nis not.\n  But what we did do to bolster that policy statement is we took the \n5th, 8th, and 14th amendment ``shock the conscience test'' and said: \nFrom the date of the Detainee Treatment Act forward, that will be an \narea that the judge has to make an inquiry into regarding the admission \nof evidence. The reason we didn't want to go backward is because before \nthe Detainee Treatment Act passed in 2005, no one had recognized the \n5th, 8th, and 14th amendment concepts applying to enemy combatants. So \nwhat we are trying to do is start over after Hamdan and incorporate \ninto the military commission model as many protections as we can that \nalso protect America. So going forward, from the Detainee Treatment Act \nforward, any evidence gathered after the Detainee Treatment Act will \nhave to comply with the 5th, 8th, and 14th amendments requirements that \nmake up the heart and soul of the Detainee Treatment Act. To make it \nretroactive and exclude statements where that concept was not known, \nwas not part of our legal system regarding enemy combatants, in my \nopinion, was unwise.\n  So we are going forward, reinforcing the Detainee Treatment Act, and \nthe standard of admission of evidence of reliable and probative meets \nthe standards of justice and totality of the circumstances test, stays \nin place, covers all statements before and after. Our Judge Advocate \nGenerals, to a person, have said that if you take the Detainee \nTreatment Act out of the equation, what is left still is acceptable. \nAnd the courts will make that decision.\n  I am confident that the standard that we had, the administration had \nwhen it came to the admission of evidence, was acceptable, and the \njudge advocates who have objected to many things did not object to \nthat.\n  So the idea that we made a conscious decision to allow cruel and \ninhumane treatment to become a player defies what we did in totality.\n  The title 18, War Crimes Act, was rewritten. One of the crimes that \nwe put in title 18 that would constitute a grave breach of the Geneva \nConventions, a felony under our own law, is cruel or inhumane \ntreatment: The act of a person who commits or conspires or attempts to \ncommit an act intended to inflict severe or serious physical or mental \npain or suffering, other than pain or suffering incidental to lawful \nsanctions, including serious physical abuse upon another within his \ncustody or control. And we defined those terms. It is a felony in U.S. \nlaw to engage in cruel or inhumane treatment, not just torture. It is a \nfelony in U.S. law to mutilate or maim.\n  What we did--intentionally causing serious bodily harm, rape, sexual \nassault or abuse, taking hostages--what we did is we took what the \nGeneva Conventions have defined as being a grave breach of the \nconventions, we put it in title 18 of the War Crimes Act, and made it a \nfelony. So if you are a military member or CIA agent and you run afoul \nof the title 18 War Crimes Act, you can be prosecuted. When it comes \ntime for the military judge to rule upon the admissibility of evidence \nin a military commission, the standard that we will be using has been \nblessed by every Judge Advocate General that we have, those in charge \nof our military legal system.\n  So I think it is a good standard. I think the fact that we put the \nDTA 5th, 8th and 14th amendment standard into the statute in a \nperfective way enhances and emboldens what we are trying to do with the \nDTA and will make us a better nation.\n  The other areas of concerns: enemy combatant definition. The enemy \ncombatant definition that is changed from the compromise and committee \nbill allows us to, subject to military commission, try those people who \nintentionally and knowingly aid terrorism; materially support \nterrorism. To me, that makes sense. I want to prosecute the person who \nsells the guns to al-Qaida as much as the people who use the weapons. I \nwant to go after the support network that supports terrorism. To me, \nthat makes perfect sense. I am glad we expanded the definition because \nthose who are assisting terrorists in a knowingly purposeful way should \nbe held accountable for their actions.\n  Under no circumstance can an American citizen be tried in a military \ncommission. The jurisdiction of military commissions does not allow for \nthe trial of American citizens or lawful combatants, and those who say \notherwise, quite frankly, have not read the legislation because there \nis a prohibition to that happening.\n  The hearsay rules that are in the compromise very much mirror the \ncommittee bill, but that we are allowing a burden shift, to me, makes \nsense given the global nature of the war. I can spend a lot of time \nexplaining the differences between the two bills, but I will basically \nsummarize by saying that the purpose of the committee bill has been met \nby the compromise. If it were not so, I would not vote for it. We are \nnot allowing into evidence coerced\n\n[[Page S10252]]\n\nstatements unless the judge makes the decision they are reliable, \nprobative, and in the totality of circumstances they meet the ends of \njustice.\n  At the end of the day you are going to have a judge applying a legal \nstandard to a request to admit evidence. The administration, in my \nopinion, in their first product, was trying to legislate a conviction. \nIn many ways they were trying to set up the rules when it came to the \nmilitary commission format that would allow evidence to go to the jury \nnever seen by the accused. That would make it very hard to defend \nyourself.\n  We have changed that. Anything the jury gets to convict, the accused \ncan examine and rebut. To me, that was a huge accomplishment that put \nthe trials back on sound footing within our value system, and legally I \nthink they will pass muster now.\n  So at the end of the day, in my opinion we do not need to try to \nlegislate how the judge should rule. Everybody has their pet peeve \nabout where the administration has failed or succeeded, about how the \nCIA has conducted its business. I have found an effort to tie the \njudges' hands to the point that we have no flexibility when it comes to \nadmitting evidence. The judge is in the best place--better than anybody \nhere--to make a decision as to what should come into that trial. What \nare we asking the judges to do? To use their experience, their \nknowledge of the law, their sense of right or wrong to determine: Is \nthat statement reliable? Is it probative? Given everything around it, \nwould the interests of justice be met if it came into the trial?\n  That is an acceptable legal standard, not only to every Judge \nAdvocate General who serves today in our military, it should be a \nstandard that every American is proud of because I am proud of it.\n  I bet you dollars to doughnuts when the Supreme Court gets hold of \nour work product they are going to approve it.\n  Finally, Hamdan is about applying the Geneva Conventions to the war \non terror. Everybody I know of in the administration believed that the \nGeneva Conventions did not apply to these unlawful enemy combatants. I \nshared that belief. We were wrong. The Supreme Court--whether I agree \nor not--ruled. After their ruling, we had two things that we had to \naccomplish to get this country back on track within the rule of law. We \nhad a challenge: to take the CIA interrogation program that existed and \nwill exist and make sure that it was Geneva Conventions compliant.\n  What do the Geneva Conventions require of every country that signs \nthe document? It requires that, domestically, that country will outlaw, \nwithin its own domestic law, grave breaches of the treaty. Every \ncountry has an affirmative duty to set out within their laws and \nprosecute their own people for grave breaches of the Geneva \nConventions.\n  Title 18 is the War Crimes Act. Under title 18 we have listed nine \ncrimes that would be considered grave breaches of the Geneva \nConventions. To the CIA: Your program, whatever it may be in classified \nform, must comply with the War Crimes Act. And the War Crimes Act runs \nthe gamut from torture to cruel, inhumane treatment, intentional \ninfliction of serious bodily injury, or mental pain.\n  We have taken nine well-defined felonies and told the CIA and every \nother agency in the country: Whatever you do, if you violate these \nstatutes you will be subject to being prosecuted.\n\n  I want a CIA program to be classified when it comes to interrogating \nhigh-value terrorist targets. I think it would be foolhardy to tell the \nterrorist community everything that comes your way when you join al-\nQaida or some other terrorist organization. But it is important to tell \nevery American, every CIA agent, their family, and the international \ncommunity what we do will not only be within the Geneva Conventions, it \nis going to be beyond what the Conventions require, and I think we have \naccomplished that.\n  There are six specified events in article 129 and article 130 of the \nGeneva Conventions that constitute grave breaches. We have adopted all \nsix, and we have added to that list. Whatever the CIA is doing and \nwherever they do it, whatever the Department of Defense is doing and \nwherever they do it, they now have the notice and the clarity that they \ndid not have before to do their job within the law.\n  This idea that we have rewritten the statute and given immunity to \npeople who have violated the statute is absurd. There is nothing in the \ncompromise or the committee bill that would give immunity or amnesty to \nsomeone who violated the felony provisions. But what we did do, that I \nam proud of, is that we took a 1997 War Crimes Act that was so ill-\ndefined that no one understood it and gave clarity and purpose to it so \nthose whom we are asking to defend us from the most vicious people in \nthe world will have a chance to know the law.\n  Abu Ghraib was about policies that cut legal corners, that migrated \nfrom one side of the Government to the other, that got everybody \ninvolved confused as to what you could and could not do. It was a \nmixture of individual deviance and bad policy, poorly trained people, \nnot enough folks to do the job, and not trained well enough to \nunderstand what the job was. It was a mess. For 2 years we have been \ntrying--and I have been as helpful as I know how to be--to create some \nsense of balance to bring order out of chaos, and we are on the verge \nof doing it.\n  This is a product, not only that I support, that I had but one that I \nam proud of. Every military lawyer who sits on the top of our military \nlegal system has had input on every issue. They have had the guts to go \nto the House and Senate and say some things about the President's \nproposal are flat wrong. That took a lot of guts, and I am here to tell \nyou the final product took their input and what their concerns were and \nhas been changed.\n  But if you want a CIA program that is not classified, you lost. I \nwant the program to be classified. But I want it to run within the \nobligations of the Geneva Conventions, and we have accomplished that.\n  Finally, what did we do in the compromise that we didn't do in the \ncommittee bill? We said that every obligation under the Geneva \nConventions that our country has, outside of the War Crimes Act, will \nbe fulfilled by our President. Under our constitutional democracy, it \nis the obligation of the executive branch to implement and interpret \ntreaties. This whole debate, what I have been working on for 2 weeks \nand getting beat up on in every talk radio show in the country, was \nabout how can you comply with the Geneva Conventions in a way that will \nbe seen by the world as not getting out of the Conventions.\n  The proposal for the Congress to redefine the treaty terms, in my \nopinion, would have created a precedent for every other country, in a \nwar that they are in the middle of, to change the treaty in the middle \nof a war. The conventions have been closed for years. It would have \nbeen wrong, ill-advised for the Congress to sit down with the President \nand rewrite the treaty obligations for domestic purposes because \nclearly then we would have been changing the treaty terms without \nnotifying the other parties.\n  What we did to avoid that is we, Congress, defined nine crimes that \nwould constitute grave breaches, honoring our commitment under the \nGeneva Conventions, to outlaw grave breaches, felonies. We have done \nour job, and we turned to the Executive and said in this legislation: \nIt is your job, Mr. President, consistent with our constitutional \ndemocracy, to implement and fulfill the obligations of the treaty \noutside of title 18. And when you make a decision, publish what you \nhave decided. And any decision you make cannot take power away from the \ncourts or the Congress that we have in the same arena.\n  Those people who want to overturn the election, who do not like \nPresident Bush, are upset that we recognized he has a role to play. Let \nme tell you, he does have a role to play. Any President has the same \nrole that we are going to give President Bush--to implement a treaty, \nnot change a treaty.\n  So I think we have done a very good job of putting into law our \nobligations under the Geneva Conventions defining, constitutionally, \nwho has what responsibility so that no reasonable person could say the \nUnited States has abandoned its longstanding obligations to the Geneva \nConventions because we have not. And that is what we have\n\n[[Page S10253]]\n\nbeen sweating over for weeks. No reasonable person can say that this \ncompromise condones torture, cruel, or inhumane treatment because we \nmake it a felony. What we have done is given the military judge the \ntools he or she will need to render justice. And I have tried to \nembolden and strengthen the Detainee Treatment Act in a way that I \nthink makes sense.\n  The military court-martial system will be the model. The military \ncommission will deviate. And the authority given to the Secretary is \nthe same authority given to the President: to make differences between \nthe district courts and the military justice system as a whole. It is \ncompliant with article 36 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. This \ncompromise is compliant with Hamdan. It is compliant with the values we \nare fighting for. And it has the flexibility we need to fight an enemy \nthat knows no bounds.\n  The work product is the result of give and take, is the result of \nbeing more than one branch of Government, is the result of having to \ndeal with a court decision that was new and novel. I can say from my \npoint of view that not only will I vote for the compromise, I am very \nproud of it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, my distinguished colleague from South \nCarolina will be placing in today's Record the correspondence from the \njudge advocate generals. I think that is very important. I think for \nthose following this debate, it would be of great interest to give an \nexample of how in response to the letter sent by the distinguished \nSenator from Michigan to a judge advocate they respond. I ask unanimous \nconsent to have printed in the Record first at this juncture a letter \nfrom Senator Levin to Bruce MacDonald, Judge Advocate General of the \nNavy, on this point of what we call the two categories of evidence.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Armed Services,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 25, 2006.\n     Rear Admiral Bruce MacDonald,\n     The Judge Advocate General, Department of the Navy, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Admiral MacDonald: The Senate will soon begin \n     consideration of a bill entitled the Military Commissions Act \n     of 2006, which would add a new Chapter 47A to title 10, \n     United States Code, addressing trials by military commission. \n     Section 948r of the proposed new chapter would address the \n     issue of compulsory self-incrimination and statements \n     obtained by torture or other methods of coercion.\n       Under this provision, a copy of which is attached, a \n     statement obtained on or after December 30, 2005 through \n     coercion that is less than torture would be admissible if the \n     military judge finds that: (1) the totality of the \n     circumstances renders it reliable and possessing sufficient \n     probative value; (2) the interests of justice would best be \n     served by admission of the statement into evidence; and (3) \n     the interrogation methods used do not violate the cruel, \n     unusual, or inhumane treatment of punishment prohibited by \n     the 5th, 8th, and 14th Amendments to the United States \n     Constitution.\n       Under the same provision, a statement obtained before \n     December 30, 2005 would be subject to the first two \n     requirements, but not the third. Consequently, a statement \n     obtained before December 30, 2005 through cruel, unusual or \n     inhumane treatment prohibited by the U.S. Constitution would \n     be admissible into evidence, as long as the other conditions \n     in the provision are met.\n       I would appreciate if you would provide your personal views \n     and advice as a military officer on the merits of this \n     provision and the impact that it would have on our own \n     troops, should they be captured by hostile forces in the \n     future. Because this issue will be debated on the Senate \n     floor this week, I request that you provide your views by no \n     later than the close of business on Tuesday, September 26, \n     2006.\n       Thank you for your assistance in this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Carl Levin,\n     Ranking Member.\n                                  ____\n\n         Department of the Navy, Office of the Judge Advocate \n           General\n                               Washington, DC, September 26, 2006.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Levin: Thank you for your letter of September \n     25, 2006, requesting my personal views on the admissibility \n     of coerced statements at military commissions.\n       My consistent position before the Congress is and has been \n     that the presiding military judge should have the discretion \n     and authority to inquire into the underlying factual \n     circumstances and exclude any statement derived from unlawful \n     coercion, in order to protect the integrity of the \n     proceeding.\n       This approach is consistent with the practice of \n     international war crimes tribunals sanctioned by the United \n     States and United Nations and addresses the concern regarding \n     reciprocal treatment of U.S. armed forces personnel in \n     present or future conflicts.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Bruce MacDonald,\n                                    Rear Admiral, JAGC, U.S. Navy.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it is a clear indication by those who are \ncurrently given the responsibility of defending the men and women of \nthe United States military how this provision in the bill now before \nthe Senate is consistent with their understanding of international and \ndomestic law.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I inquire of our distinguished colleague, \nis he now drawing time on the Levin amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time is from the Democratic \nleader's time on the measure itself.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, how much time is there to the Democratic \nleader on this?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has 47 minutes; 45 \nminutes of the 57 minutes remaining to the Democratic leader.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as I said earlier, I understood that the \nconsent agreement was to give me 45 minutes on the Specter-Leahy-Dodd \namendment and 15 minutes on the bill. That seems to not have been the \nagreement entered into by leadership. I ask that I take 10 minutes from \nthe Democratic leader's time and the remaining time from my own 45 \nminutes of time.\n  I see the concern by the Senator from Michigan. I will take it from \nmy 45 minutes. I also note that I will not consent to any other time \nagreements on this bill insofar as the time agreement I understood I \nhad was not entered into. I will take the 45 minutes.\n  Mr. President, this administration has yet to come clean to the \nCongress or the American people in connection with the secret legal \njustifications it has generated and secret practices it has employed in \ndetaining and interrogating hundreds if not thousands of people in the \nwar on terror. Even they cannot dismiss the practices at Guantanamo as \nthe actions of a few ``bad apples.'' With Senate adoption of the anti-\ntorture amendment last year and the recent adoption of the Army Field \nManual, I had hoped that 5 years of administration resistance to the \nrule of law and to the U.S. military abiding by its Geneva obligations \nmight be drawing to a close. Despite the resistance of the Vice \nPresident and the administration, the new Army Field Manual appears to \noutlaw several of what the administration euphemistically calls \n``aggressive'' tactics and that much of the world regards as torture \nand cruel and degrading treatment. Of course, the President in his \nsigning statement undermined enactment of the anti-torture law, and now \nthe administration is seeking still greater license to engage in harsh \ntechniques in connection with the military tribunal legislation before \nus now.\n  What is being lost in this debate is any notion of accountability. \nWhere are the facts of what has been done in the name of the United \nStates? Where are the legal justifications and technicalities the \nadministration's lawyers have been seeking to exploit? Senator Levin's \namendment, which restores the bipartisan legislation passed by the \nSenate Armed Services Committee, would maintain some accountability for \nthis administration's actions and some standards of justice and \ndecency. The Republican leadership's legislation which is before us now \nstrips away all accountability and erodes our most basic national \nvalues.\n  If the administration had answered me when I asked over and over \nabout the Convention Against Torture and about rendition, we could have \ncome to grips with those matters before they degenerated, as they have, \ninto international embarrassment for the United States. As Secretary \nColin Powell wrote recently, ``The world is beginning to doubt the \nmoral basis of our fight against terrorism.'' It did not need to come \nto that.\n  If FBI Director Mueller had been more forthcoming with me at or after \nthe May 2004 hearing in which I asked him about what the FBI had \nobserved at Guantanamo, we could have gotten to a detention and \ninterrogation policy\n\n[[Page S10254]]\n\nbefitting the U.S. years sooner than we have.\n  If the administration would have responded to my many inquiries over \nthe years regarding the rendition of Maher Arar, I would not have had \nto send yet another demand for information to the Attorney General this \nweek, and we would not have been embarrassed by the Canadian commission \nreport about his being sent by U.S. authorities to Syria where he was \ntortured. Mr. Arar is the Canadian citizen who was returning to Canada \nthrough New York when he was arrested by American authorities at JFK \nairport and held for 12 days without access to a Canadian consular \nofficial or lawyer. He was then rendered, not to Canada, but to Syria, \nwithout the knowledge or approval of Canadian officials, where he was \ntortured. Last week, a Canadian commission inquiry determined that Mr. \nArar had no ties to terrorists, he was arrested on bad intelligence, \nand his forced confessions in Syria reflected torture, not the truth. \nSadly, the administration is still seeking to avoid accountability by \nhiding behind legal doctrines. The administration continues to thwart \nevery effort to get to the facts, to get to the truth and to be \naccountable. I am worried that the legislation before us is one more \nexample of that trend.\n  Unfortunately, Senator Levin's amendment, like the Armed Services \nCommittee's bill, retains the extremely troubling habeas provision. I \nwill be submitting an amendment to strip that provision.\n  We are rushing through legislation that would have a devastating \neffect on our security and on our values, and we need to step back and \nthink about what we are doing. The President recently said that ``time \nis of the essence'' to pass legislation authorizing military \ncommissions. Time was of the essence when this administration took \ncontrol and did not act on the dire warnings of terrorist action. Time \nwas of the essence in August and early September 2001 when the 9/11 \nattacks could still have been prevented. This administration ignored \nwarnings of a coming attack and even proposed cutting the anti-terror \nbudget. It focused on Star Wars, not terrorism. Time was of the essence \nwhen Osama bin Laden was trapped in Tora Bora.\n  After 5 years of unilateral actions by this administration that have \nleft us less safe, time is now of the essence to take real steps to \nkeep us safe from terrorism like those in the Real Security Act, S. \n3875. Instead, the President and the Republican Senate leadership call \nfor rubberstamping more flawed White House proposals in the run up to \nanother election. I hope that this time the U.S. Senate will act as an \nindependent branch of the government and finally serve as a check on \nthis administration.\n  We need to pursue the war on terror with strength and intelligence, \nbut also to do so consistent with American values. The President says \nhe wants clarity as to the meaning of the Geneva Conventions and the \nWar Crimes Act. Of course, he did not want clarity when his \nadministration was using its twisted interpretation of the law to \nauthorize torture, cruel and inhumane treatment of detainees and spying \non Americans without warrants and keeping those rationales and programs \nsecret from Congress. The administration does not seem to want clarity \nwhen it refuses even to tell Congress what its understanding of the law \nis following the withdrawal of a memo that said the President could \nauthorize and immunize torture. That memo was withdrawn because it \ncould not stand up in the light of day.\n  It seems that the only clarity this administration wants is a clear \ngreen light from Congress to do whatever it wants. That is not clarity; \nit is immunity. That is what the current legislation would give to the \nPresident on interrogation techniques and on military commissions. \nJustice O'Connor reminded the nation before her retirement that even \nwar is not a ``blank check'' when it comes to the rights of Americans. \nThe Senate should not be a rubberstamp for policies that undercut \nAmerican values and make Americans around the world less safe.\n  In reality, we already have clarity. Senior military officers tell us \nthey know what the Geneva Conventions require, and the military trains \nits personnel according to these standards. We have never had trouble \nurging other countries around the world to accept and enforce the \nprovisions of the Geneva Conventions. There was enough clarity for \nthat. What the administration appears to want, instead, is to use new \nlegislative language to create loopholes and to narrow our obligations \nnot to engage in cruel, degrading, and inhuman treatment.\n\n  In fact, the new legislation muddies the waters. It saddles the War \nCrimes Act with a definition of cruel or inhuman treatment so oblique \nthat it appears to permit all manner of cruel and extreme interrogation \ntechniques. Senator McCain said this weekend that some techniques like \nwaterboarding and induced hypothermia would be banned by the proposed \nlaw. But Senator Frist and the White House disavowed his statements, \nsaying that they preferred not to say what techniques would or would \nnot be allowed. That is hardly clarity; it is deliberate confusion.\n  Into that breach, this legislation throws the administration's \nsolution to all problems: more Presidential power. It allows the \nadministration to promulgate regulations about what conduct would and \nwould not comport with the Geneva Conventions, though it does not \nrequire the President to specify which particular techniques can and \ncannot be used. This is a formula for still fewer checks and balances \nand for more abuse, secrecy, and power-grabbing. It is a formula for \nimmunity for past and future abuses by the Executive.\n  I worked hard, along with many others of both parties, to pass the \ncurrent version of the War Crimes Act. I think the current law is a \ngood law, and the concerns that have been raised about it could best be \naddressed with minor adjustments, rather than with sweeping changes.\n  In 1996, working with the Department of Defense, Congress passed the \nWar Crimes Act to provide criminal penalties for certain war crimes \ncommitted by and against Americans. The next year, again with the \nPentagon's support, Congress extended the War Crimes Act to violations \nof the baseline humanitarian protections afforded by Common Article 3 \nof the Geneva Conventions. Both measures were supported by a broad \nbipartisan consensus, and I was proud to sponsor the 1997 amendments.\n  The legislation was uncontroversial for a good reason. As I explained \nat the time, the purpose and effect of the War Crimes Act as amended \nwas to provide for the implementation of America's commitment to the \nbasic international standards we subscribed to when we ratified the \nGeneva Conventions in 1955. Those standards are truly universal: They \ncondemn war criminals whoever and wherever they are.\n  That is a critically important aspect of the Geneva Conventions and \nour own War Crimes Act. When we are dealing with fundamental norms that \ndefine the commitments of the civilized world, we cannot have one rule \nfor us and one for them, however we define ``us'' and ``them.'' As \nJustice Jackson said at the Nuremberg tribunals, ``We are not prepared \nto lay down a rule of criminal conduct against others which we would \nnot be willing to have invoked against us.''\n  In that regard, I am disturbed that the legislation before us narrows \nthe scope of the War Crimes Act to exclude certain violations of the \nGeneva Conventions and, perhaps more disturbingly, to retroactively \nimmunize past violations. Neither the Congress nor the Department of \nDefense had any problem with the War Crimes Act as it now stands when \nwe were focused on using it to prosecute foreign perpetrators of war \ncrimes. I am concerned that this is yet another example of this \nadministration overreaching, disregarding the law and our international \nobligations, and seeking to immunize others to break the law. It also \ncould well prevent us from prosecuting rogues who we all agree were out \nof line, like the soldiers who mistreated prisoners at Abu Ghraib.\n\n  The President said on May 5, 2004 about prisoner mistreatment at Abu \nGhraib: ``I view those practices as abhorrent.'' He continued: ``But in \na democracy, as well, those mistakes will be investigated, and people \nwill be brought to justice.'' The Republican leader of the Senate said \non the same day: ``I rise to express my shock and\n\n[[Page S10255]]\n\ncondemnation of these despicable acts. The persons who carried them \nmust face justice.''\n  Many of the despicable tactics used in Abu Ghraib the use of dogs, \nforced nudity, humiliation of various kinds do not appear to be covered \nby the narrow definitions this legislation would graft into the War \nCrimes Act; of course, despite the President's calls for clarity, the \nnew provisions are so purposefully ambiguous that we cannot know for \nsure. If the Abu Ghraib abuses had come to light after the perpetrators \nleft the military, they might not have been able to be brought to \njustice under the administration's formulation.\n  The President and the Congress should not be in the business of \nimmunizing people who have broken the law, making us less safe, turning \nworld opinion against us, and undercutting our treaty obligations in \nways that encourage others to ignore the protections those treaties \nprovide to Americans. We should be very careful about any changes we \nmake.\n  If we lower our standards of domestic law to allow outrageous \nconduct, we can do nothing to stop other countries from doing the same. \nThis change in our law does not prevent other countries from \nprosecuting our troops and personnel for violations of the Geneva \nConvention if they choose; it only changes our domestic law. But it \ncould give other countries a green light to change their own law to \nallow them to treat our personnel in cruel and inhuman ways.\n  Let me be clear. There is no problem facing us about overzealous use \nof the War Crimes Act by prosecutors. In fact, as far as I can tell, \nthe Ashcroft Justice Department and the Gonzales Justice Department \nhave yet to file a single charge against anyone for violation of the \nWar Crimes Act. Not only have they never charged American personnel \nunder the act, they have never used it to charge terrorists either.\n  We can address any concerns about the War Crimes Act with reasonable \namendments, as the Warner-Levin bill did, without gutting the Act in a \nway that undermines our moral authority and makes us less safe. Senator \nLevin's amendment goes back to the Warner-Levin bill's formulation, and \nI urge Senators of both parties to support it.\n  The proposed legislation would also allow the admission into military \ncommission proceedings of evidence obtained through cruel and inhuman \ntreatment. This provision would once again allow this administration to \navoid all accountability for its misguided policies which have \ncontributed to the rise of a new generation of terrorists who threaten \nus. Not only would the military commission legislation before us \nimmunize those who violated international law and stomped on basic \nAmerican values, but it would allow them then to use the evidence \ngotten in violation of basic principles of fairness and justice.\n  Allowing in this evidence would violate our basic standards of \nfairness without increasing our security. Maher Arar, the Canadian \ncitizen sent by our government to Syria to be tortured, confessed to \nattending terrorist training camps. A Canadian commission investigating \nthe case found that his confessions had no basis in fact. They merely \nreflected that he was being tortured, and he told his torturers what \nthey wanted to hear. It is only one of many such documented cases of \nbad information resulting from torture. We gain nothing from allowing \nsuch information. The Armed Services Committee bill, which the Levin \namendment restores, would not allow the use of this tainted evidence.\n  The military commissions legislation departs in other unfortunate \nways from the Warner-Levin bill. Early this week, apparently at the \nWhite House's request, Republican drafters added a breathtakingly broad \ndefinition of ``unlawful enemy combatant'' which includes people--\ncitizens and non-citizens--alike--who have ``purposefully and \nmaterially supported hostilities'' against the United States or its \nallies. It also includes people determined to be ``unlawful enemy \ncombatant'' by any ``competent tribunal'' established by the President \nor the Secretary of Defense. So the government can select any person, \nincluding a U.S. citizen, whom it suspects of supporting hostilities--\nwhatever that means--and begin denying that person the rights and \nprocesses guaranteed in our country. The implications are chilling. We \nshould go back to the reasonable definition the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee came up with. That is what the Levin amendment does.\n  I hope that we will take the opportunity before us to consider and \npass bipartisan legislation that will make us safer and help our fight \non terrorism, both by giving us the tools we need and by showing the \nworld the values we cherish and defend, the same values that make us a \ntarget. We should amend the legislation before us to keep the War \nCrimes Act strong and to require some accountability from the \nadministration. The Levin amendment does just that, and I urge all \nsenators to vote for it. Let us join together on behalf of real \nsecurity for Americans.\n  Mr. President, before we stand here congratulating ourselves too much \nabout all the wonderful things we did in these closed-door meetings and \nthese back-room meetings and the Bush-Cheney statements about what we \nare allowed to do or not allowed to do in what has become an \nincreasingly rubberstamp Congress--the most rubberstamp Congress I have \never seen in 32 years here--I want to talk about the habeas stripping \nprovisions, what I call un-American provisions, which are regrettably \nin the bill before us and unfortunately contained in the committee \nbill, and even included in the amendment before us now. The Specter-\nLeahy-Dodd amendment will eliminate those provisions from the bill \npending before the Senate.\n  It will be interesting to see whether the Bush-Cheney administration \nwill allow Republican Senators to vote for it. Lord knows there have \nnot been many votes made here that have been by independent Senators.\n  As currently drafted, section 7 of the military commissions bill \nwould wrongfully, and in my view, unconstitutionally eliminate the writ \nof habeas corpus for anyone detained by this administration on \nsuspicion of being what they call an ``enemy combatant,'' which is a \ndangerous concept that is being expanded by a vague and ever-expanding \ndefinition.\n  The President could basically say I think you are an enemy combatant, \nand lock you up, and you can't even contest it.\n  I think of the hundreds of pages of statements made by Senators on \nboth sides of the aisle when other countries have done something this \narbitrary, or this vague, and locked up people inside their borders, \nand we said how un-American it is. If we pass this, we can no longer \ncall it un-American. We can call it codified American law.\n  Important as the rules for military commissions are, they will apply \nto only a few cases. In this war on terror, you may wonder how many \npeople have been brought to justice. We are holding about 500 people in \nGuantanamo. We are so committed to this war that we have charged a \ntotal of 10 people in the nearly 5 years that the President declared \nhis intention to use military commissions. That is two a year. They \njust announced plans to charge an additional 14 men. At this rate, I \nwill be about 382 years old when they get around to charging all the \npeople they are detaining. But for the vast majority of the almost 500 \nprisoners at Guantanamo, and the thousands it has detained over the \nlast 5 years, the administration's position remains as stated by \nSecretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld 3 years ago: There is no interest \nin trying them.\n  It is not just a question of we have no interest in trying those we \nhave determined to be enemy combatants. If we have dozens and dozens or \neven hundreds of people who are picked up by mistake or turned over by \nbounty hunters to get the bounty and not because they might have done \nsomething, we are not going to try them either. Sorry, we are just \ngoing to lock them up.\n  Perhaps the single most consequential provision of the so-called \nmilitary commissions bill can now be found buried nearly 100 pages in \nto curtail judicial review and any meaningful accountability. This \nprovision would perpetuate the indefinite detention of hundreds of \nindividuals against whom the Government has brought no charges and \npresented no evidence, without any recourse to justice whatsoever. \nMaybe some of them are guilty.\n\n[[Page S10256]]\n\nIf they are, try them. But we have to understand that there may be \npeople in there who have no reason to be there and there are no charges \nand no evidence. This is un-American, it is unconstitutional, and it is \ncontrary to American interests. This is not what a great and wonderful \nnation should be doing.\n  Going forward, the bill departs even more radically from our most \nfundamental values. I am proud to be an American, and I am proud to be \na Senator. But mostly I am proud of what has been in the past our \nAmerican values. Provisions that were profoundly troubling a week ago \nwhen the Armed Services Committee marked up the bill have gotten much \nworse in the course of the closed-door revisions over the past 5 days, \nincluding the last round of revisions, which were put in behind closed \ndoors and sent around late yesterday, and that the majority now demands \nwe pass immediately. Five years they sit, doing nothing, and then all \nof sudden, whoops, the polls look bad this fall for the election: \nQuick, pass anything, no matter how unconstitutional it might be.\n  For example, the bill has been amended to eliminate habeas corpus \nreview even for people inside the United States, and even for people \nwho have not been determined to be enemy combatants. Quick, pass it; \nquick, do it now; quick, pass it out of here so we can rubberstamp it \nin a signing ceremony before anybody reads the fine print.\n  We have done this in the past. As a witness said before our committee \nthis week, we did this in the past. We did it with the Tonkin Gulf \nResolution. We did it with the internment of Japanese Americans. Now we \nare about to do it again.\n  As the bill now stands, it would permit the President to detain \nindefinitely--even for life--any alien, whether in the United States or \nabroad, whether a foreign resident or a lawful permanent resident, \nwithout any meaningful opportunity for that person to challenge his \ndetention. The administration would not even need to assert, much less \nprove, that the alien was an enemy combatant; it would suffice to say \nthat the alien was awaiting a determination on that issue, even though \nthey may wait 20, 30, 40 years and wait until the grave gives them \ntheir escape.\n  In other words, the bill would send a message to the millions of \nlegal immigrants living in America, participating in American families, \nworking for American businesses, and paying American taxes. Its message \nwould be that our Government may at any minute pick them up and detain \nthem indefinitely without charge and without any access to the courts \nor even to military tribunals unless and until the Government \ndetermines that they are not enemy combatants--even though they have no \nability to help in that determination themselves. In turn, the bill now \ndefines the term enemy combatants in a tortured and unprecedented broad \nmanner.\n  Detained indefinitely, and unaccountably, until they are proven \ninnocent; even though they have no right to stand up and offer proof. \nIt is like the Canadian citizen Maher Arar, shipped off to a torture \ncell in Syria by the Bush-Cheney administration, despite what the \nCanadian Government recently concluded, that there is no evidence that \nhe ever committed a crime or posed a threat to either the United States \nor Canadian security. Pick him up. He looks bad. Ship him to Syria. \nTorture him. Maybe he will confess to something and prove we were \nright.\n  Now it has been documented the Bush-Cheney administration did the \nwrong thing to the wrong man. When asked about it, what do they do? As \nusual, they evade all accountability. This is an administration that \nmakes no mistakes. A rubberstamp Congress will never ask them what they \ndid, they make no mistakes, and they hide behind a purported State \nsecrets privilege.\n  The administration's defenders would like to believe Mr. Arar's case \nis an isolated blunder, but it is not. We have numerous press accounts \nthat have quoted administration officials themselves who believe a \nsignificant percentage of those detained at Guantanamo Bay have no \nconnection to terrorism. They have been held by the Bush-Cheney \nadministration for several years and the administration intends to hold \nthem indefinitely without trial or any recourse to justice, even though \na substantial number of them are innocent people who were turned in by \nanonymous bounty hunters or picked up by mistake in the fog of war.\n  The most important purpose of habeas corpus is not to give people \nextra rights. No one is asking to give people special rights. Habeas \ncorpus does not do that. Habeas corpus is intended to correct errors \nsuch as this to protect the innocent. It is precisely to prevent such \nabuses that the Constitution prohibits the suspension of the writ of \nhabeas corpus ``unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion public \nsafety may require it.''\n  I would assume the Bush-Cheney administration is not saying we are \nhandling this question of terrorists so poorly that we are under \ninvasion now. And I have no doubt this bill, which will permanently \neliminate the writ of habeas corpus for all aliens within and outside \nthe United States whenever the Government says they might be enemy \ncombatants, violates that prohibition. I believe even the present \nSupreme Court, seven of the nine members now Republican, would hold it \nunconstitutional.\n  When former Secretary of State Colin Powell wrote of his concerns \nwith the administration's bill, he wrote: ``The world is beginning to \ndoubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism.''\n  Talk to anyone who travels around the world anywhere, even among some \nof our closest allies, our best friends. We are asked, What are you \ndoing? Have you lost your moral compass? And these are countries that \nfaced terrorist attacks long before we did.\n  General Powell, former head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was right.\n  We have heard from current and former diplomats, military lawyers, \nFederal judges, law professors, law school deans, and even a former \nSolicitor General under the first President Bush, Kenneth Starr, that \nthey have grave concerns with the habeas corpus stripping provisions of \nthis bill. I have letters that come from across the political and legal \nspectrum saying this is wrong.\n  I ask unanimous consent that some of these letters be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               September 25, 2006.\n     To United States Senators and Members of Congress.\n\n       Dear Madams/Sirs: This letter is written in the name of the \n     former members of the diplomatic service of the United States \n     listed below.\n       We urge that the Congress, as it considers the pending \n     detainee legislation, not eliminate the jurisdiction of the \n     courts to entertain habeas corpus petitions filed on behalf \n     of those detainees.\n       There is no more central principle of democracy than that \n     an officer of the executive branch of government may restrain \n     no one except at sufferance of the judiciary. The one branch \n     is vital to insure the legitimacy of the actions of the \n     other. Habeas corpus is the ``Great Writ.'' It is by habeas \n     corpus that a person--any person--can insure that the \n     legality of his or her restraint is confirmed by a court \n     independent of the branch responsible for the restraint. \n     Elimination of judicial review by this route would undermine \n     the foundations of our democratic system.\n       Weare told that the central purpose of our engagement in \n     that ``vast external realm'' today is the promotion of \n     democracy for others. All nations, we urge, should embrace \n     the principles and practices of freedom and governance that \n     we have embraced. But to eliminate habeas corpus in the \n     United States as an avenue of relief for the citizens of \n     other countries who have fallen into our hands cannot but \n     make a mockery of this pretension in the eyes of the rest of \n     the world. The perception of hypocrisy on our part--a sense \n     that we demand of others a behavioral ethic we ourselves may \n     advocate but fail to observe--is an acid which can overwhelm \n     our diplomacy, no matter how well intended and generous. \n     Pretensions are one thing; behavior another, and quite the \n     more powerful message. To proclaim democratic government to \n     the rest of the world as the supreme form of government at \n     the very moment we eliminate the most important avenue of \n     relief from arbitrary governmental detention will not serve \n     our interests in the larger world.\n       This is the first and primary reason for rejecting the \n     proposal. But the second is almost as important, and that is \n     its potential for a reciprocal effect. Pragmatic \n     considerations, in short, are in this instance at one with \n     considerations of principle. Judicial relief from arbitrary \n     detention should be preserved here else our personnel serving \n     abroad\n\n[[Page S10257]]\n\n     will suffer the consequences. To deny habeas corpus to our \n     detainees can be seen as prescription for how the captured \n     members of our own military, diplomatic and NGO personnel \n     stationed abroad may be treated.\n       As former officials in the diplomatic service of our \n     nation, this consideration weighs particularly heavily for \n     us. The United States now has a vast army of young Foreign \n     Service officers abroad. Many are in acute and immediate \n     danger. Over a hundred, for example, are serving in \n     Afghanistan. Foreign service in a high-risk post is \n     voluntary. These officers are there willingly. The Congress \n     has every duty to insure their protection, and to avoid \n     anything which will be taken as justification, even by the \n     most disturbed minds, that arbitrary arrest is the acceptable \n     norm of the day in the relations between nations, and that \n     judicial inquiry is an antique, trivial and dispensable \n     luxury.\n       We urge that the proposal to curtail the reach of the Great \n     Writ be rejected.\n           Respectfully submitted,\n         William D.

Watson.\n                                  ____\n\n       To Members of Congress: The undersigned retired federal \n     judges write to express our deep concern about the lawfulness \n     of Section 6 of the proposed Military Commissions Act of 2006 \n     (``MCA''). The MCA threatens to strip the federal courts of \n     jurisdiction to test the lawfulness of Executive detention at \n     the Guantanamo Bay Naval Station and elsewhere outside the \n     United States. Section 6 applies ``to all cases, without \n     exception, pending on or after the date of the enactment of \n     [the MCA] which relate to any aspect of the detention, \n     treatment, or trial of an alien detained outside of the \n     United States . . . since September 11, 2001.''\n       We applaud Congress for taking action establishing \n     procedures to try individuals for war crimes and, in \n     particular, Senator Warner, Senator Graham, and others for \n     ensuring that those procedures prohibit the use of secret \n     evidence and evidence gained by coercion. Revoking habeas \n     corpus, however, creates the perverse incentive of allowing \n     individuals to be detained indefinitely on that very basis by \n     stripping the federal courts of their historic inquiry into \n     the lawfulness of a prisoner's confinement.\n       More than two years ago, the United States Supreme Court \n     ruled in Rasul v. Bush, 542 U.S. 466 (2004), that detainees \n     at Guantanamo have the right to challenge their detention in \n     federal court by habeas corpus. Last December, Congress \n     passed the Detainee Treatment Act, eliminating jurisdiction \n     over future habeas petitions filed by prisoners at \n     Guantanamo, but expressly preserving existing jurisdiction \n     over pending cases. In June, the Supreme Court affirmed in \n     Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, 126 S. Ct. 2749 (2006), that the federal \n     courts have the power to hear those pending cases. These \n     cases should be heard by the federal courts for the reasons \n     that follow.\n       The habeas petitions ask whether there is a sufficient \n     factual and legal basis for a prisoner's detention. This \n     inquiry is at once simple and momentous. Simple because it is \n     an easy matter for judges to make this determination--federal \n     judges have been doing this every day, in every courtroom in \n     the country, since this Nation's founding. Momentous because \n     it safeguards the most hallowed judicial role in our \n     constitutional democracy--ensuring that no man is imprisoned \n     unlawfully. Without habeas, federal courts will lose the \n     power to conduct this inquiry.\n       We are told this legislation is important to the ineffable \n     demands of national security, and that permitting the courts \n     to play their traditional role will somehow undermine the \n     military's effort in fighting terrorism. But this concern is \n     simply misplaced. For decades, federal courts have \n     successfully managed both civil and criminal cases involving \n     classified and top secret information. Invariably, those \n     cases were resolved fairly and expeditiously, without \n     compromising the interests of this country. The habeas \n     statute and rules provide federal judges ample tools for \n     controlling and safeguarding the flow of information in \n     court, and we are confident that Guantanamo detainee cases \n     can be handled under existing procedures.\n       Furthermore, depriving the courts of habeas jurisdiction \n     will jeopardize the Judiciary's ability to ensure that \n     Executive detentions are not grounded on torture or other \n     abuse. Senator John McCain and others have rightly insisted \n     that the proposed military commissions established to try \n     terror suspects of war crimes must not be permitted to rely \n     on evidence secured by unlawful coercion. But stripping \n     district courts of habeas jurisdiction would undermine this \n     goal by permitting the Executive to detain without trial \n     based on the same coerced evidence.\n       Finally, eliminating habeas jurisdiction would raise \n     serious concerns under the Suspension Clause of the \n     Constitution. The writ has been suspended only four times in \n     our Nation's history, and never under circumstances like the \n     present. Congress cannot suspend the writ at will, even \n     during wartime, but only in ``Cases of Rebellion or Invasion \n     [when] the public Safety may require it.'' U.S. Const. art. \n     I, Sec. 9, cl. 2. Congress would thus be skating on thin \n     constitutional ice in depriving the federal courts of their \n     power to hear the cases of Guantanamo detainees. At a \n     minimum, Section 6 would guarantee that these cases would be \n     mired in protracted litigation for years to come. If one goal \n     of the provision is to bring these cases to a speedy \n     conclusion, we can assure you from our considerable \n     experience that eliminating habeas would be \n     counterproductive.\n       For two hundred years, the federal judiciary has maintained \n     Chief Justice Marshall's solemn admonition that ours is a \n     government of laws, and not of men. The proposed legislation \n     imperils this proud history by abandoning the Great Writ to \n     the siren call of military necessity. We urge you to remove \n     the provision stripping habeas jurisdiction from the proposed \n     Military Commissions Act of 2006 and to reject any \n     legislation that deprives the federal courts of habeas \n     jurisdiction over pending Guantanamo detainee cases.\n           Respectfully,\n       Judge John J. Gibbons, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third \n     Circuit (1969-1987), Chief Judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals \n     for the Third Circuit (1987-1990).\n       Judge Shirley M.

Arlen Specter,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on the Judiciary,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Specter: I write to express my concerns about \n     the limitations on the writ of habeas corpus contained in the \n     compromise military commissions bill, The Military \n     Commissions Act of 2006 (S. 3930). Although S. 3930 contains \n     many laudable improvements to military commission procedure, \n     section 6 of the bill effectively bars detainees at the U.S. \n     Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba from applying for habeas \n     corpus review of their executive detention. I am concerned \n     that limitation may go too far in limiting habeas corpus \n     relief, especially in light of the apparent conflict between \n     the holdings of Rasul v. Bush, 124 S. Ct. 2684 (2004), and \n     Johnson v. Eisentrager, 339 U.S. 763 (1950).\n       Although the Rasul Court limited its holding to statutory \n     habeas rights, which may be limited by the Congress, the \n     Supreme Court nevertheless viewed Guantanamo Bay, Cuba as a \n     territory within the control and jurisdiction of the United \n     States. Accordingly, the Eisentrager case may no longer be \n     relied upon with confidence to rule out constitutional habeas \n     protections for Guantanamo detainees. One of the Eisentrager \n     factors that limited constitutional habeas rights for aliens \n     in military custody was whether the detainee was held outside \n     of the United States. Based on the finding of the Rasul case \n     that Guantanamo Bay falls within U.S. territorial \n     jurisdiction, Guantanamo detainees likely have a different \n     constitutional status than the alien detainees in \n     Eisentrager, who were held in Landsberg, Germany.\n       Article 1, section 9, clause 2 of the United States \n     Constitution provides that ``[t]he Privilege of the Writ of \n     Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of \n     Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.'' The \n     United States is neither in a state of rebellion nor \n     invasion. Consequently, it would problematic for Congress to \n     modify the constitutionally protected writ of habeas corpus \n     under current events.\n\n[[Page S10258]]\n\n       I encourage the Senate Judiciary Committee to study the \n     constitutional implications of S. 3930 on the habeas corpus \n     rights of detainees in United States territory. Although no \n     one wants the War on Terror to be litigated in the courts, \n     Congress should act cautiously to strike a balance between \n     the need to detain enemy combatants during the present \n     conflict and the need to honor the historic privilege of the \n     writ of habeas corpus. I thank you for holding a hearing on \n     this topic and hope that it helps to strike that balance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Kenneth W. Starr.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Monday we rushed to hold a hearing before the Judiciary \ncommittee on this important issue, and what happens? The surrogate for \nthe administration, former White House associate counsel Brad Berenson, \nwho testified before us, defends the habeas corpus stripping provisions \nof this bill by arguing that the United States has been and still is \nsuffering from an invasion that requires the suspension of habeas \ncorpus.\n  What are we doing? What is going on? That is outrageous. That is \nrunning scared. That is so wrong. Is he saying that for 5 years this \nadministration has been allowing an ongoing invasion in the United \nStates and we are not aware of it? Are we going to suspend the great \nwrit on this basis?\n  To quote Kenneth Starr:\n\n       The United States is neither in a state of rebellion nor \n     invasion. Consequently, it would [be] problematic for \n     Congress to modify the constitutionally protected writ of \n     habeas corpus under current events.\n\n  I suppose the administration would say we are not modifying it. Heck, \nno, we are eliminating it. We are not modifying the writ of habeas \ncorpus, we are knocking it out for all aliens.\n  I agree with those from the right to the left, we should not modify, \nand we certainly should not eliminate, the great writ of habeas corpus. \nI agree with hundreds of law professors who described an earlier, less \nextreme version of the habeas provisions of this bill as ``unwise and \ncontrary to the most fundamental precepts of American constitutional \ntradition.'' And I agree with the former ambassadors and other senior \ndiplomats who wrote to us saying that eliminating habeas corpus for \naliens does not help America, it does not make America safer, but \nrather it harms our interests abroad and makes us less safe.\n  Maybe some of those who want to pretend how powerful they have been \nin military matters ought to talk to those who have been in the \nmilitary and actually understand a time when we are reaping the \nmistakes of our folly in Iraq. Let us not expand it further. The United \nStates, especially since World War II and the Marshall Plan, has been a \nbeacon of hope and freedom for the world. How do we spread a message of \nfreedom abroad if our message to those who come to America is that they \nmay be detained indefinitely without any recourse to justice?\n  In the wake of the attack of September 11, and in the fact of the \ncontinuing terrorist threat, now is not the time for the United States \nto abandon its principles. Admiral Hutson was right to point out that \nwhen we do, there would be little to distinguish America from a banana \nrepublic or the repressive regimes against which we are trying to rally \nthe world and the human spirit.\n  Now is not the time to abandon American values and to shiver and \nquake as though we are a weak country and we have to rely on secrecy \nand torture. We are too great a nation for that. Those are the ways of \nweakness. Those are the ways of repression and oppression. Those are \nnot the ways of America. Those are not the ways of this Nation I love.\n  The habeas provisions of this bill are wrongheaded. They are \nflagrantly unconstitutional. Tinkering with them would not make them \nless wrongheaded but might make them less flagrantly unconstitutional. \nI see no reason to save the administration from itself and from the \ninevitable defeat when the Supreme Court strikes them down.\n  Why should those who take our oath to uphold the Constitution \nseriously, who understand the fundamental importance of habeas to \nfreedom, find ourselves compromising with such an irresponsible \nprovision?\n  That is why at the appropriate point the chairman of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee and I will offer just one amendment, to remove the \nhabeas provisions from the bill in their entirety. That is the right \nthing to do. I should also add, that is the American thing to do. We \nwould still be left with the disgraceful but less extreme habeas \nstripping provisions that we enacted earlier this year in the Detainee \nTreatment Act. But we would at least not make one bad mistake even \nworse. By not totally eliminating habeas for all aliens, we can reduce \nthe damage to America's credibility as a champion of freedom and show \nthe American people and the courts that Congress is not entirely \ncavalier when it comes to its constitutional obligations. We can show \nthe world that this great Nation is not so frightened and so shaky and \nso quaky that we are going to have to give up the principles that made \nus a great nation.\n  Our amendment would reduce the grave harm that will be done if the \nbill before the Senate passes. It was not too late last night for the \nRepublicans to make yet more revisions to this unconstitutional bill. \nIt is not too late today for the Senate to make the bill a little less \nbad, a little less offensive to the values and freedom for which \nAmerica stands.\n  This is one American who is not going to run and hide. This is one \nAmerican who is not willing to cut down the laws of our Nation. This is \none American who thinks these laws and our protections have made us \ngreat not only here but abroad. This is one American who thinks that \nour freedoms, our laws, our protections, are what attracted people from \nother countries, people from other countries who have fled oppression \nin their own country and fled a lack of rule of law in their own \ncountry, to come to America, where we have a rule of law.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we are anxious to go on with the matters \nbefore the Senate this afternoon in connection with this pending bill.\n  As I understand it, the amount of time remaining on the Levin \nsubstitute amendment is how much?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan has 24 minutes 10 \nseconds; the Senator from Virginia has 24 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. It had been my hope we could set this amendment aside \npending instructions from the leadership as to a time of vote and \nproceed to another amendment.\n  At this point in time, I see another colleague who is seeking \nrecognition.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask for 12 minutes from the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, we are engaged in a very important debate \nabout the way we will bring to justice very heinous individuals who \ncommitted terrorism. I will put in context first what I think the \nsituation is.\n  First, our most essential mission in the war on terror is to find \nthese individuals, to attempt to capture them, and if they have refused \nto be captured, to take extreme measures to eliminate them as terrorist \nthreats to the United States.\n  If they are in our hands as detainees or in any capacity, we have an \nobligation to interrogate them and we have to be consistent with \ninternational norms while also recognizing that as we treat people in \nour custody we can expect if our military personnel fall in the hands \nof a military power, they will be similarly treated. We must be very \nconscious of this.\n  But an important point that is often overlooked in the entire debate, \nall of the individuals we are talking about today--the 14 detainees at \nGuantanamo Bay and others--are enemy combatants. Under international \nlaw, they can be held indefinitely. There is a big difference between \nan individual who is an enemy combatant and someone who is in a \ncriminal justice situation someplace else. Even if these individuals \nare acquitted of their crimes, they are still in the custody of the \nUnited States and still will remain in the custody of the United \nStates.\n  So as we debate this issue of military tribunals, we have to \nrecognize what we are talking about is not allowing people to walk out \nthe door because our procedures are inadequate, because some clever \nattorney can take advantage of the rules of evidence. They will\n\n[[Page S10259]]\n\nnever walk out the door. What we are talking about is whether we will \nhave legitimacy to impose the most difficult sanction on an individual, \nthe most severe sanction. To be consistent with our value as a nation, \nI believe we have to have procedures that are procedurally legitimate, \nthat are fair and are perceived that way.\n  There is another issue here, not just in terms of our moral standing. \nIt is a very practical one. I have suggested it before. How we treat \nthese people will be the standard with which our military personnel \nwill be treated overseas. We will surrender the right to condemn those \npeople who may in the future hold our soldiers if they choose to use \nprocedural gimmicks, if they want to stage show trials rather than real \ntrials, if they want to punish an American fighting man or woman \nwithout any regard for the principles and practices of international \nlaw. That is, I think, the issue before us today.\n\n  The substitute Senator Levin has offered today is one we supported on \na bipartisan basis in the committee. It was a strong, good bill. It \nrepresented not only our best principles, but it recognized that these \nprinciples could also and would also be applied in the future--we hope \nnot--but certainly we have to recognize the possibility that American \nmilitary personnel will be in the hands of hostile forces in the \nfuture.\n  The bill we had in the Armed Services Committee did things this \nlegislation before us undoes. For example, the committee bill \nprohibited the admission of statements obtained through cruel, inhuman, \nor degrading treatment. The bill before us prohibits the admission of \nstatements obtained after December 30, 2005, through ``cruel, inhuman \nor degrading treatment,'' but it contains no prohibition against using \nstatements so obtained prior to December 30, 2005.\n  I do not think the Geneva Conventions were in abeyance up until \nDecember 30, 2005. I do not think the standards we should insist upon \ndid not exist there. And very practically speaking, ask yourself, would \nwe accept the response from a foreign power who said: Oh, of course, we \nare going to follow the Geneva Conventions. Of course we are not going \nto use abusive treatment to obtain a confession, prior to December 30, \n2020 or 2015? I think this seriously weakens not only the legitimacy of \nthis approach but also our ability to argue with compelling legal and \nmoral force in the future that other nations have to play by the rules.\n  There are other provisions here in this bill, and there are many of \nthem that I think alter dramatically what we accomplished on a \nbipartisan basis, what was applauded by General Powell and General \nVessey and others.\n  For example, the committee bill provided that evidence seized outside \nof the United States shall not be excluded from trial by military \ncommissions on the grounds the evidence was not seized pursuant to a \nsearch warrant. That was a very practical provision. We are not going \nto require a soldier, a special forces operator who is running through \nthe woods of some foreign land, to produce a search warrant when he \npicks up valuable intelligence material.\n  But the bill before us deletes the limitation to evidence seized \noutside the United States. As a result, the bill authorizes the use of \nevidence that is seized inside the United States without a search \nwarrant. This provision is not limited to evidence seized from enemy \ncombatants. It does not even preclude the seizure of evidence without a \nwarrant when that evidence is seized from United States citizens.\n  If you want an invitation to irresponsible conduct within the United \nStates, disregarding our principles of justice and the Constitution of \nthe United States, it might be found here because, frankly, we have the \nobligation to establish rules we can live with. No one is arguing with \ntrying to create some type of situation in which a soldier has to pull \nout his Black's Law Dictionary and have his warrant and do all these \nthings, but it is quite a bit different from police authorities here in \nthe United States.\n  Additional problems with this bill: The committee bill, the one we \nsupported in the Armed Services Committee, provided that the procedures \nand rules of evidence applicable in trials by general courts martial \nwould apply in trials by military commissions, subject to such \nexceptions as the Secretary of Defense determines to be ``required by \nthe unique circumstances of the conduct of military and intelligence \noperations during hostilities or by other practical need.'' Establish a \nrule saying: Listen, we are going to use the procedures for courts \nmartial except if the Secretary says there is some expedient \ncircumstance. Because of hostilities, we have to make changes. This \napproach is consistent with Hamdan and the Supreme Court.\n  The bill before us reverses the presumption. Instead of starting with \nthe rules applicable in trials by courts martial as the governing \nprovision, and then establishing exceptions, the Secretary of Defense \nis required to make trials by commission consistent with those rules \nonly when he considers it is practical. The exception has swallowed up \nthe rule.\n  As one observer has pointed out, this provision is now so vaguely \nworded that it could even be read to authorize the administration to \nabandon the presumption of innocence in trials by military commissions, \nwith the claim that military expedience requires a determination that \nthe individual is guilty, and then he or she may prove their innocence. \nThat, I think, is a significant retreat from the standards we \nestablished.\n  There is another major issue here that is so important, and it is \noften confused; and that is with respect to Common Article 3. In \nHamdan, the Supreme Court held that Common Article 3 applies to all \nmembers of al-Qaida, terrorists, anyone who comes into our control, not \nonly in the areas of fair trials, but also in the areas of treatment.\n\n  But I want to clarify this because this is often, I think, distorted \nand perhaps deliberately so. Many opponents of this legislation have \nstated that ``terrorists should not be given the same rights as our \nmilitary personnel.'' What they are, I think, imprecisely but \ndeliberately, perhaps, suggesting is that we are attempting to treat \nthese individual terrorists as prisoners of war. And that is not the \ncase. There are four Geneva Conventions. The first two protect sick and \ninjured soldiers. The fourth protects civilians in areas of \nhostilities.\n  The third convention--not the third Common Article--the third Geneva \nConvention deals with prisoners of war, our soldiers who fall into the \nhands of hostile forces. These provisions are very clear about how POWs \nmust be treated. You only have to give your name, rank, and serial \nnumber. That is it. Beyond that, there is no question. You cannot have \nany mental or physical coercion. ``[P]risoners of war who refuse to \nanswer may not be threatened, insulted, or exposed to any unpleasant or \ndisadvantageous treatment of any kind.''\n  That is the way soldiers should be treated--all of our soldiers. But \nthe Supreme Court never said that is the way we have to treat these \nterrorists. What they said is Common Article 3, which is in every \nConvention. It establishes a general baseline of the treatment of \nindividuals. POWs are treated at a much higher status because of their \nuniformed participation in armed conflict, because of their discipline, \nbecause of the fact that we expect them to follow rules, too. But \npeople who fall into our hands who are enemy combatants do not deserve \nthat treatment. They are not going to get it here. But they have to be \nafforded Common Article 3 protection. It has been described as ``a \nconvention within a convention.''\n  Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions mandates that all persons \ntaking no active part in hostilities, including those who have laid \ndown their arms or been incapacitated by capture or injury, are to be \ntreated humanely and protected from ``violence to life and person,'' \nand any ``outrages upon personal dignity, in particular, humiliating \nand degrading treatment.'' Anyone in our custody has to be afforded the \nprotections of Common Article 3.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 12 minutes.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I know there are others who wish to speak. I \nask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes to simply summarize.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. We have to follow Common Article 3. However, the bill we \nare\n\n[[Page S10260]]\n\nconsidering today authorizes the President to interpret the Geneva \nConventions and provides that such interpretations ``shall be \nauthoritative . . . as a matter of U.S. law, in the same manner as \nother administrative regulations.'' I think we are verging on a \nsituation where the President, by definition, by clarification, and by \nregulation, could eviscerate these Common Article 3 protections.\n  As I mentioned before, Secretary Powell and others have stated this \nis the core ideal, principle, we have to use in dealing with all of \nthese individuals.\n  Let me simply conclude, there is, I think, the presumption here that \nif we do not establish procedures that basically make it a slam dunk \ncase, that we somehow are going to see these terrorists walk away, snub \ntheir noses at us, and start actively conspiring against us again.\n  They will never see the light of day. No President will release these \nindividuals. And no President will be forced under any international \nlaw to do so. But we will be judged whether, when we impose \npunishment--not detention, punishment--on these individuals, we have \ndone it according to our principles that we can argue before the world \nand the American people represent our values; and we can insist that \nother nations that may hold our forces or civilians abide by the same \nprinciples. That is the issue here today. That is why I support Senator \nLevin's substitute amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coburn). Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten minutes 16 seconds.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield 9 minutes to the Senator from New \nMexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized for \n9 minutes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Michigan for \nyielding me time and I also thank him for bringing forth this \namendment.\n  I strongly support his proposal, essentially, to take the \nlegislation, the agreement that was worked out in the Armed Services \nCommittee by our colleagues, and to substitute that for what is now \nbefore us.\n  This overall military commissions bill has three general areas of \nfocus: first, the rules pertaining to the interrogation of prisoners; \nsecond, the procedures we should have in place for the trial of \nindividuals who are brought before military commissions; and, third, \nthe rights of those prisoners who under this bill will continue to be \nheld without being charged at Guantanamo or elsewhere in the world, or \neven in this country.\n  Let me take a moment to briefly comment on these first two issues \nbefore I discuss the third issue, which I believe has not received the \nattention that it deserves.\n  With regard to interrogation techniques, I have been deeply troubled \nby the administration's insistence on weakening the prohibition on the \nuse of torture and cruel and inhumane treatment. I strongly believe \nthat we can give our military and intelligence officers the tools they \nneed to protect the American public without abandoning our basic \ndecency. The use of torture and other abusive techniques are not only \nmorally repugnant, but they are ineffective and do great damage to our \nNation's credibility with respect to our commitment to human rights. \nThey also put our soldiers at risk of being subjected to similar \ntreatment.\n  Rather than redefining the Geneva Conventions to permit harsh \ninterrogation techniques by the CIA, as the administration had \nproposed, the Republican compromise legislation retroactively revises \nthe War Crimes Act so that criminal liability does not result from \ntechniques that the United States may have employed, such as simulated \ndrowning, exposure to hypothermia, and prolonged sleep deprivation.\n  Under the Detainee Treatment Act, which we passed last year to \nreaffirm the prohibition on torture, the military is clearly prohibited \nfrom engaging in torture or cruel, degrading or inhumane treatment, as \nspecified in the recently issued Army Field Manual. However, under the \nbill we are debating today, the CIA would be allowed to continue to \nsubject detainees to harsh interrogation techniques without fear of \ncriminal liability. As the President has stated, the ``program'' can \ncontinue.\n\n  In essence, the legislation defines prisoner abuse and criminal \nliability in such a way that the administration is able to argue that \nit is complying with international and domestic legal restraints while \nat the same time continue to use techniques that amount to abuse under \ninternational treaty obligations.\n  There is also a fundamental lack of clarity with respect to what \nconduct this legislation forbids. For example, when asked if water-\nboarding is permitted under this bill, Senator McCain has said that it \nwould not be allowed. But if one asks the administration, it will only \nsay CIA interrogation techniques are classified and that the bill \nallows the CIA to continue to use so-called alternative interrogation \ntechniques--techniques which our military is prohibited from employing.\n  I think there is little doubt that these disturbing practices \ncontinue. This type of legal ambiguity has not served us well with \nrespect to the treatment of detainees, and we should be taking this \nopportunity to provide greater legal clarity, not further muddying the \nwater.\n\n  I am also concerned about the rules and procedures of the newly \nconstituted military commissions. The bill permits statements allegedly \nderived through coercive means to be used if the statements are \nprobative and were obtained prior to December 2005, which coincides \nwith the enactment of the Detainee Treatment Act. Statements obtained \nafter the enactment of the Detainee Treatment Act cannot be admitted as \nevidence if they have been derived through interrogation techniques \nthat amount to cruel, unusual, or inhumane treatment as prohibited by \nthe fifth, eighth, and fourteenth amendments to the U.S. Constitution. \nEssentially we are saying that you can't admit statements derived from \ncoercive methods except for those statements derived when we were using \ncoercive methods. Having these two different standards may be \nbeneficial from the prosecution's perspective in terms of increasing \nthe likelihood that statements will be found admissible, but it is not \nexactly the clarity we should have with regard to standards of justice.\n  There are also a variety of problems regarding the rules on hearsay, \nthe appeals process, the definition and retroactive application of \ncrimes, and the admission of secret evidence, among others. Overall, \nthe rules and procedures contained in the proposed legislation fall \nshort of the basic fairness required in any criminal trial.\n  I wish to talk about the provisions that relate to habeas corpus. One \nof the most disturbing provisions in the underlying legislation \npertains to the disposition of those prisoners who will never be \ncharged before a military commission or any court but who, instead, \nwill be held indefinitely--or at least that option exists for our \nexecutive and our military to hold those individuals indefinitely in \nconfinement.\n  The current bill endorses the administration's practice of \ndesignating people, including U.S. citizens, I would point out, as \n``enemy combatants.'' It eliminates the ability of aliens--non-U.S. \ncitizens--to bring habeas claims or other claims related to their \ndetention or their treatment or their conditions of confinement.\n  Whereas the previous attempt to strip the Federal courts of \njurisdiction over these individuals under the Detainee Treatment Act \napplied only to individuals held by the Department of Defense at \nGuantanamo, this current legislation applies to any alien who is \ndetained by the United States anywhere in the world, including those \nwho are held within the United States. The current language also makes \nit clear that the elimination of judicial review is retroactive. It \napplies to all cases involving the detention of individuals since \nSeptember 11, 2001.\n  Various of my colleagues have already talked about the right of \nhabeas corpus and its importance in our system of justice. Simply \nstated, the ability to file a writ of habeas corpus is the right of a \nperson to challenge the legal basis for their detention.\n  Habeas, which is also known as the Great Writ, is one of the most \nfundamental protections against arbitrary\n\n[[Page S10261]]\n\ngovernmental power. This right dates back to the Magna Carta of 1215, \nand is enshrined in Article I, section 9, clause 2 of the U.S. \nConstitution. Filing a habeas petition doesn't entitle a person to a \nfull-blown trial, but it does provide a means to ask whether the \nperson's confinement is in compliance with the law. It doesn't confer \nany additional constitutional rights; it simply allows a person to ask \nwhether their depravition of liberty is consistent with the \nConstitution.\n  One of the principal arguments proponents for removing this \nprotection have put forward in the past was that maintaining habeas \nrights leads to unnecessary and frivolous litigation. The fact is that \nthese arguments misconstrue the nature of habeas petitions. The reality \nis, in my view, that court-stripping provisions will not, in fact, lead \nto less litigation. For example, if this measure is passed, the courts \nwill be forced to consider whether this provision amounts to a \nsuspension of the writ of habeas corpus. If it is determined that it \ndoes suspend the writ of habeas corpus, the courts will determine \nwhether the suspension clause of the Constitution has been satisfied. \nOur Constitution is very clear. It says Congress is afforded the \nauthority to suspend habeas in cases of rebellion and invasion. At a \ntime when our courts are open and functioning, I think a person would \nbe hard-pressed to argue that public safety requires removing judicial \nreview. One would be hard-pressed to argue that we are in a period of \nrebellion, or that we have suffered an invasion, as that phrase was \nintended by our Founding Fathers.\n  The one other issue, of course, that I think is important is that the \nConstitution gives Congress the power to suspend the writ. Here we are \nnot just suspending the writ; this proposal is to abolish the writ, to \npermanently eliminate this right, this protection for this group of \nindividuals. In my view, it makes more sense to simply allow the courts \nto hear the cases that are pending in the courts and determine the \nlegality of the detention that is occurring. It makes more sense to do \nthat than it does to litigate over whether those individuals who are \nincarcerated, in fact, have a right to have their cases heard.\n  If what the administration says is true and the indefinite \nimprisonment of individuals at Guantanamo or elsewhere is legal, then \nwhy does the administration continue to fight so hard to eliminate the \nability of the courts to hear those cases? If these individuals are in \nfact ``the worst of the worst,'' which we have been assured, then why \nis it so difficult to provide some factual basis for continuing to \ndetain them?\n  The likelihood is that some, and maybe many, of these prisoners have \nvery little to do with terrorism. According to a 2002 CIA report, most \nof the Guantanamo prisoners ``did not belong there.'' According to a \nWall Street Journal article earlier this year, an estimated 70 percent \nof the individuals held at Guantanamo were wrongfully imprisoned. BG \nJay Hood, the former commander at Guantanamo, was quoted as saying, \n``Sometimes, we just didn't get the right folks.''\n  I don't believe that all of those being held at Guantanamo are \ninnocent. Clearly, they are not. Those who are a threat need to be held \naccountable for their actions, need to be tried before properly \nconstituted military commissions or criminal courts. Those who are not \na threat need to be released and returned to their country of origin. \nThe point is that judicial review allows us to sort the good from the \nbad and focus our efforts on those who in fact do pose a threat to our \ncountry.\n  It is during times like these that our Founding Fathers envisioned \nhabeas corpus rights needed to be preserved. If judicial review is not \nrequired as a matter of law, it makes sense from a policy standpoint to \npreserve these essential rights in the law. Having a court determine \nwhether a person's detention by the executive branch is consistent with \nour Constitution and laws does not inhibit this Nation's ability to \nfight terrorism. To the contrary, ensuring that we are holding the \nright people not only allows us to focus on those who truly pose a \nthreat, it also will help to reduce criticism in the world community \nthat the United States is not complying with its own laws and \nConstitution.\n  In a letter I received from over 30 former diplomats, they stated:\n\n       To proclaim democratic government to the rest of the world \n     as the supreme form of government at the very time that we \n     eliminate the most important avenue of relief from arbitrary \n     governmental detention will not serve our interest in the \n     larger world.\n\n  I agree with that statement.\n  It is also important to note that should the current habeas language \nbe removed from the bill, Guantanamo prisoners would still be \nprohibited from bringing habeas claims in the future under current law. \nIn the Rasul decision, the Supreme Court held that U.S. courts have \njurisdiction to hear habeas claims of Guantanamo prisoners. Congress \nsubsequently passed the Detainee Treatment Act, which contained the \nGraham-Levin compromise language regarding the elimination of habeas. \nGraham argued that the language was retroactive and barred all pending \ncases, and Levin argued that the language only eliminated cases \ninitiated after the enactment of the act.\n  In assessing whether the Supreme Court had jurisdiction to hear the \nHamdan case, the Court found that because congressional intent was \nunclear it would be inappropriate to view the statute as retroactive. \nAs such, if the status quo is maintained, we would still have language \non the books that prohibits any future habeas claims from being filed \non behalf of Guantanamo prisoners. Although I disagree with the law as \nit currently stands, Senators should know that if the language in the \nexisting bill is removed, this Congress has already drastically limited \njudicial review.\n  It is important to look at the big picture. As general matter, this \nbill puts in place procedures to try suspected terrorist by military \ncommissions whereby the only ones who will have an opportunity to prove \ntheir innocence will be the high-level prisoners. The suspected low-\nlevel prisoners will continue to linger in indefinite imprisonment \nwithout charges. Before the previous military commissions were found \nunconstitutional, the administration charged approximately 10 detainees \nwith crimes. None were ever tried. The President has indicated that he \nnow intends to charge the 14 CIA prisoners, or at least some of them, \nunder the newly constituted military commissions.\n\n  Therefore, the reality is that of the approximately 450 prisoners now \nat Guantanamo only about 25 will likely receive trials. Under the \ncompromise legislation, the remaining prisoners, many of whom have been \nimprisoned for more than 4 years, will not be held accountable nor will \nthey be able to prove their innocence--instead, they will be denied the \nright to challenge the legality of their continued confinement.\n  As Rear Admiral John Hutson, Rear Admiral Guter, and Brigadier \nGeneral Brahms, pointed out in a letter to the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, the effect of this legislation would be to give greater \nprotections to the likes of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed than to the vast \nmajority of the Guantanamo detainees, who claim that they have nothing \nto do with al-Qaida or the Taliban.\n  Mr. President I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in \nthe Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. (See \nexhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Most troubling of all, with this legislation Congress \nis giving its consent to the executive branch to continue to \nunilaterally designate individuals as enemy combatants and imprison \nthem indefinitely. We are saying that the President can pick up whoever \nhe wants, designate them an enemy combatant and hold them without \nsubstantive judicial review.\n  I know that many of my colleagues have worked to ensure that the \nmilitary commission procedures comply with our international legal \nobligations under the Geneva Conventions and that our Nation's soldiers \nare not put at risk by diminished standards. I support these efforts, \nand believe that the trial of these suspected terrorists is long \noverdue. However, passing this flawed bill is not the solution.\n  Mr. President, this debate is about who we are as a people and \nwhether we are going to continue to adhere to the rule of law and basic \nhuman rights. It\n\n[[Page S10262]]\n\nis about our fundamental values as a people. The U.S. Constitution was \ncrafted by men who were keenly aware of the potential abuse that could \nresult from providing the executive branch with unrestrained powers \nwith respect to individuals' liberties. The Constitution was crafted to \nbe relevant in the good times, as well as in the times when our Nation \nfaces domestic or foreign threats.\n  It deeply concerns me that with this bill we are sanctioning the \nindefinite imprisonment of people without charges. This is wrong. \nShould this legislation pass as currently drafted, history will not \nlook kindly on this mistaken endeavor.\n  Frankly, the notion that Congress is willing to provide the President \nwith the authority to indefinitely imprison people without ever having \nto charge them is quite astonishing. What is more amazing is that the \nSenate appears prepared to do so after one brief hearing in the Senate \nJudiciary Committee on the issue and with little substantive debate on \nthe Senate floor.\n  We must also remember that in establishing these military commissions \nwe are not solving the Guantanamo problem. This legislation will result \nin a flurry of legal challenges. The administration's handling of \ndetainee issues has brought us Guantanamo, Abu Griab, and a series of \nSupreme Court decisions rejecting the administration's legal positions. \nLet us not complicate the problem by enacting the provisions.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                               September 12, 2006.\n     Senator John Warner,\n     Chairman, U.S. Senate Committee on Armed Services, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Senator Carl Levin,\n     Ranking Member, U.S. Senate Committee on Armed Services, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       We find it necessary yet again to communicate with you \n     about issues arising out of our policies concerning detainees \n     held at Guantanamo Bay. It would appear that each time the \n     U.S. Supreme Court speaks, efforts are taken to reverse by \n     legislation the decision of the Court. We refer, of course, \n     to the Supreme Court's Rasul and Hamdan decisions and to the \n     provision in the Administration's proposed Military \n     Commissions Act of 2006 that would strip the federal courts \n     of jurisdiction over even the pending habeas cases that have \n     been brought by the detainees at Guantanamo to challenge the \n     basis for their detention. We urge you to reject any such \n     habeas-stripping provision.\n       As we have argued and agreed since 9/11, it is necessary \n     for Congress to enact legislation to create military \n     commissions that recognize both the basic notions of due \n     process and the need for specialized rules and procedures to \n     deal with the new paradigm we call the war on terror. This \n     effort must cover those already charged with violating the \n     laws of war and those newly transferred to Guantanamo Bay.\n       But the military commissions we are now fashioning will \n     have no application to the vast majority of the detainees who \n     have never been charged, and most likely never will be \n     charged. These detainees will not go before any commissions, \n     but will continue to be held as ``enemy combatants.'' It is \n     critical to these detainees, who have not been charged with \n     any crime, that Congress not strip the courts of jurisdiction \n     to hear their pending habeas cases. The habeas cases are the \n     only avenue open for them to challenge the bases for their \n     detention--potentially life imprisonment--as ``enemy \n     combatants.''\n       We strongly agree with those who have argued that we must \n     arrive at a position worthy of American values, i.e., that we \n     will not allow military commissions to rely on secret \n     evidence, hearsay, and evidence obtained by torture. But it \n     would be utterly inconsistent, and unworthy of American \n     values, to include language in the draft bill that would, at \n     the same time, strip the courts of habeas jurisdiction and \n     allow detainees to be held, potentially for life, based on \n     CSRT determinations that relied on just such evidence. The \n     effect would be to give greater protections to the likes of \n     Khalid Sheikh Mohammed than to the vast majority of the \n     Guantanamo detainees, who claim that they had nothing to do \n     with al Qaeda or the Taliban.\n       We are on a course that should have been plotted and \n     navigated years ago, and we might be close to consensus. We \n     ask that, in the closing moments of your consideration of \n     this vital bill, you restore the faith of those who long have \n     been a voice for simple commitment to our longstanding basic \n     principles, to our integrity as a nation, and to the rule of \n     law. We urge you to oppose any further erosion of the proper \n     authority of our courts and to reject any provision that \n     would strip the courts of habeas jurisdiction.\n       As Alexander Hamilton and James Madison emphasized in the \n     Federalist Papers, the writ of habeas corpus embodies \n     principles fundamental to our nation. It is the essence of \n     the rule of law, ensuring that neither king nor executive may \n     deprive a person of liberty without some independent review \n     to ensure that the detention has a reasonable basis in law \n     and fact. That right must be preserved. Fair hearings do not \n     jeopardize our security. They are what our country stands \n     for.\n           Sincerely,\n     John D. Hutson,\n       Rear Admiral, JAGC, USN (Ret.).\n     Donald J. Guter,\n       Rear Admiral, JAGC, USN (Ret.).\n     David M. Brahms,\n       Brigadier General, USMC (Ret.).\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we are prepared to yield back the time on \nthis side. First, I simply say to my colleagues that this has been a \ngood debate. But I assure colleagues that the bill now before them has \nbeen very carefully reviewed by the Department of Justice, and I have \neven reached out to scholars--lawyers who I know have a considerable \ndepth of knowledge about international matters as well as our own \nfabric of law as it relates to criminal prosecution. I myself served as \nassistant U.S. attorney for close to 5 years.\n  We bring before this Chamber a work product which we believe is \nconsistent with international as well as domestic law. It strikes a \nbalance. We have no intention to try to accord aliens engaged as \nunlawful combatants with all the rights and privileges of American \ncitizens, but we recognize that they are human beings, and this country \nhas standards that respect life and human beings. But at the same time, \nwe are engaged in a war on terror. Let there be no mistake about that.\n  One of the challenges in this war on terror is with these individuals \nwho are willing to act as human bombs. It doesn't have a lot of \nprecedent. We have been very careful to try to strike a balance between \nthe standards and principles that guide this Nation, at the same time \nrecognizing that we need the tools to fight this war on terror--\nfighting it in a way that not only enables our men and women in the \nArmed Forces in forward deployments to carry out their missions but to \npreserve and protect us here at home from tragic incidents like we \nexperienced on 9/11.\n  As I have worked through each of these provisions and consulted with \nmy colleagues, I always bring up the images of 9/11. I think our \nPresident has done his best to try to prepare this Nation, in many \nways, to protect ourselves from the repetition of that or any incident \nlike it--a lesser incident or a greater incident. It is a constant \nchallenge.\n  But the bill before this body represents our best product that we \ncould achieve, working together and in consultation with a wide range \nof individuals who have an expertise in these complicated legal matters \nand can provide to us their own corroboration of our judgments as to \nhow best to structure this legal document and strike the balance that \nwe must between our standards of law and our recognition of \ninternational law. I think that is the hallmark of what Senators \nMcCain, Graham, and myself set out to do--to make sure this Nation \ncannot be perceived as trying to rewrite in any way Common Article 3, \nwhich is the law of our land, I remind citizens who are following this \ndebate. It is the international treaties to which we, with the advice \nand consent of the Senate and that of the President, acceded and \nsigned, and it has become part of the law of the land. I am proud of \nthe work we have done, certainly, in that complicated area, as well as \nothers.\n  Mr. President, at this time, I am prepared to yield back all the time \non this side and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, there is no question that we have to fight \nthe war on terrorism, and we can win that war, but we can do so without \ncompromising the very principles that govern this Nation and have given \nus strength and attract us to so many other nations. Those principles \nare compromised in the bill before us. They were not compromised in the \ncommittee bill that passed on a bipartisan vote.\n  Here are two quick examples of how our basic principles are \ncompromised\n\n[[Page S10263]]\n\nin this bill: Evidence shall not be excluded from trial by military \ncommission on the grounds that the evidence was not seized pursuant to \na search warrant. In other words, in the United States of America, \nevidence can be seized from an American citizen, not an enemy \ncombatant--it can be seized from any one of us without a search warrant \nand used in one of these trials. This language in the bill which is \nbefore us would authorize the use of that evidence so seized. That is a \nfundamental compromise with the principles that have governed this \nNation. We have never allowed testimony and statements that have been \nobtained through cruel and inhuman treatment to be introduced into \nevidence. Yet that is the way the bill is written.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 30 additional \nseconds to finish that statement.\n  Mr. WARNER. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair.\n  A second example of how a fundamental principle is compromised in the \nbill before us is, if a statement is obtained through cruel and inhuman \ntreatment of somebody, for the first time in American jurisprudence, \nthis bill would apparently say that statement is allowable in evidence \nif it was acquired before December 30, 2005. That is unlike statements \nthat are acquired after December 30, 2005, where there are no ifs, \nands, or buts, there are no other tests that need to be applied--if it \nwas obtained through cruel and inhuman treatment, it is not admissible \ninto evidence. That is a fundamental principle which is not followed \nfor statements obtained before December 30, 2005, in the bill before \nus. That is another example of why the substitute, I hope, will be \nadopted, which is the committee bill--a bipartisan bill--that is now \nbefore us.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask to reclaim about 6 minutes of my \ntime so that I can engage my colleague in a colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right and may reclaim his \ntime.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to make clear that category of \nevidence cannot reach those established standards of torture. No \nevidence that was gained by means that are tantamount to the torture \ncan be admitted.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleague, am I not correct in that \nstatement?\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is correct. That is not in dispute.\n  Mr. WARNER. Does the Senator concur in that statement?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I surely do. We are talking here about cruel and inhuman \ntreatment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Correct, but the judge of the court is going to look at \nthat evidence. We have set forth certain standards that have to be met, \nbut one standard that judge cannot violate is the standard of torture. \nIf that case can be made, then that judge has no ability to admit any \nevidence which is tantamount to torture. I ask my colleague, is that \nnot correct?\n  Mr. LEVIN. The statement is correct. The issue, of course, which we \nare debating is why, relative to statements obtained prior to December \n30, 2005, is another test omitted, which is present for statements \nobtained after December 30, 2005, which are statements that are \nobtained through cruel and inhuman treatment. That is the issue which I \nraised.\n  Mr. WARNER. Lastly, Mr. President, I ask my colleague, he makes \nreference to the illegal searches and seizures, which is the fourth \namendment to the U.S. Constitution. That Constitution does not give \nprotection to aliens who are the subject of these trials; am I not \ncorrect in that?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I think that is true. It may or may not protect aliens, \nbut it does protect American citizens. And the language on page 21 does \nnot protect American citizens from seizures that are illegal. It says:\n\n       Anything which is seized without a search warrant is \n     allowable into these trials.\n\n  It is not limited to material that is seized from aliens or material \nwhich is seized from enemy combatants. It says illegally obtained \nmaterial can be admitted into this trial, period.\n  We had such a restriction in the bill which came out of committee so \nthat it was limited to evidence which was seized abroad, for instance. \nThat would be fine because they may not have the fourth amendment that \nwe do. But in the bill which is now before us, there is no such \nlimitation.\n  I will read the one sentence:\n\n       Evidence shall not be excluded--\n\n  Shall not be excluded--\n\n     from trial by military commission on the grounds that the \n     evidence was not seized pursuant to a search warrant or other \n     authorization.\n\n  In the substitute bill, that allowance of illegally seized evidence \nis limited to evidence which is not seized from American citizens here. \nSo that distinction has been obliterated in the bill which is before \nus.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we have clearly debated it, but I want to \nmake, in conclusion, the observation that no evidence which is the \nconsequence of torture can be admitted. The aliens are not entitled to \nthe constitutional provisions of the fourth amendment and, therefore, I \nurge our colleagues to think carefully through those arguments which we \nbelieve we have fully answered and carefully written this bill to be in \nconformity with our Constitution.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n5086. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senators were necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Arizona (Mr. McCain) and the Senator from Maine (Ms. \nSnowe).\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the managers, working with our leadership, \nof course, have a designated number of amendments. My understanding at \nthis time is that the Senator from Pennsylvania will be recognized for \nthe purpose of proposing an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 5087\n\n       (Purpose: To strike the provision regarding habeas review)\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 5064.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is advised we have No. 5087 at the \ndesk?\n  Mr. SPECTER. The amendment which I seek to call up, Mr. President, is \none which proposes to strike section 7 of the Military Commission Act \nentirely.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield for a moment, I \nask\n\n[[Page S10264]]\n\nthe Chair to recite the unanimous consent agreement with regard to the \namendment of Senator Specter, the time limitation being?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment has 2 hours equally divided on \nit.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Specter], for himself \n     and Mr. Leahy, Mr. Dodd, and Mr. Feingold, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 5087:\n\n       On page 93 strike line 9 and all that follows through page \n     94, line 13.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a couple of \nclarifications?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I do yield.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in stating the time, isn't there also the \nremainder of the time? I did not use my full 45 minutes this afternoon. \nDoesn't the Senator from Vermont have some remaining time on this \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has remaining time on \nthe bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. How much time is that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has 23 minutes on the \nbill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, am I correct that the amendment is offered \non behalf of the distinguished senior Senator from Pennsylvania and \nmyself, the distinguished senior Senator from Connecticut, and the \ndistinguished Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. Feingold?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask and also the distinguished Senator from North \nDakota, Mr. Dorgan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator from Pennsylvania will yield just for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I do.\n  Mr. REID. I have had conversations--I have not spoken with the \nSenator from Pennsylvania, but I have spoken with his staff on a number \nof occasions. I had the understanding that the Senator would be able to \ngive Senator Leahy a few minutes off of his time to speak on this \namendment?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I will consider that, depending on how the argument \ngoes. I appreciate very much the contribution of the distinguished \nranking member. I do not know how many people on this side are going to \nseek time, but I do believe we can accommodate the request of Senator \nLeahy. But I want to see how the argument goes before making a \ncommitment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, substantively, my amendment would retain \nthe constitutional right of habeas corpus for people detained at \nGuantanamo. The bill before the Senate strips the Federal district \ncourt of jurisdiction to hear these cases. The right of habeas corpus \nwas established in the Magna Carta in 1215 when, in England, there was \naction taken against King John to establish a procedure to prevent \nillegal detention.\n  What the bill seeks to do is to set back basic rights by some 900 \nyears. This amendment would strike that provision and make certain that \nthe constitutional right and the statutory right--but fundamentally the \nconstitutional right of habeas corpus--is maintained. The core \nprovision is contained in article I, section 9, clause 2 of the U.S. \nConstitution, which states:\n\n       The privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be \n     suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the \n     public Safety may require it.\n\n  We do not have either rebellion or invasion, so it is a little hard \nfor me to see, as a basic principle of constitutional law, how the \nCongress can suspend the writ of habeas corpus in the face of that flat \nlanguage. When you have an issue of constitutionality, how can \nconstitutionality be determined and interpreted except in the Court?\n  We had a very extended discussion of this in the confirmation of \nChief Justice Rehnquist, and the Chief Justice said that the Congress \nof the United States lacked the authority to remove the jurisdiction of \nthe Federal courts on issues involving the first amendment.\n  The same thing would apply generally. It is a constitutional \nquestion. But here you have it buttressed in addition by an express \nprovision by the Framers, focusing on the writ of habeas corpus in and \nof itself, and saying you can't suspend it, so that anyone who can make \nan argument about stripping jurisdiction--I don't think it lies on a \nconstitutional issue generally because if it does, who is going to \ninterpret the Constitution if the Court does not have jurisdiction? But \nthe writ of habeas corpus is so important and so fundamental and so \ndeeply ingrained in our tradition, going back to 1215 against King \nJohn, that the Framers made it expressed and explicit.\n  It appears to me that this is really dispositive and you don't really \nneed several hours to develop it. But I shall proceed on the matter as \nto how we got where we are and what the Supreme Court has had to say in \nfour major cases in the course of the last 18 months.\n  The Congress of the United States has the express responsibility \nunder article I, section 8 of the U.S. Constitution to establish rules \ngoverning people captured on land and sea. But the Congress of the \nUnited States did not act after 9/11, and we had people detained at \nGuantanamo. Legislation was introduced by many Senators. Senator Durbin \nand I introduced a bill. Senator Leahy introduced a bill. Many Senators \nintroduced legislation, but the Congress did not act on it. Congress \ndid not act on it because it was too hot to handle. What resulted is \nwhat results many times--Congress punted. It didn't act, left it to the \nSupreme Court of the United States. That took a long time, to have \nthese cases come through the judicial process.\n  Finally, in June of 2005 the Supreme Court ruled in three major \ncases: Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, Rasul v. Bush, and Rumsfeld v. Padilla. The \nSupreme Court of the United States rejected the argument of the \nGovernment that the President had inherent power under article 2 and \ncould act on that constitutional authority, and the Supreme Court said \nthat habeas corpus was effective.\n  In Rasul v. Bush, the Supreme Court said that it applied even to \naliens. It didn't have to be a citizen; that the Constitution draws no \ndistinction between Americans and aliens held in custody and said the \nwrit of habeas corpus applied.\n  In the case of Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, Justice O'Connor had this to say: \nAll agree that absent suspension, the writ of habeas corpus remains \navailable to every individual detained within the United States.\n  That was held to apply to Guantanamo, since the United States \ncontrolled Guantanamo.\n  Justice O'Connor went on to say that under the U.S. Constitution, \narticle I, section 9, clause 2:\n\n       The privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be \n     suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the \n     public Safety may require it.\n  Justice O'Connor then goes on to delineate statute 2241, which sets \nthe outline of the procedures, and then says habeas petitioners would \nhave the same opportunity to present and rebut facts that court cases \nlike this retain some ability to vary the ways in which they do so as \nmandated by due process.\n  What has happened in Guantanamo with respect to the proceedings under \nthe Combat Status Review Tribunal, referred to as CSRT, demonstrates \nthe importance of having some impartial judicial review to find what, \nin fact, has happened. These tribunals operate with very little \ninformation. Somebody is picked up on the battlefield. There is no \nrecord preserved as to what that individual did. If there was a weapon \ninvolved, it has been placed with many other weapons, and it can't be \nidentified. The proceedings simply do not comport with basic fairness \nbecause the individuals do not have the right to know what evidence \nthere is against them.\n  Repeatedly, the Combat Status Review Tribunal said the information is \nclassified and the individual can't have it.\n  There was specific reference to the proceedings in the CSRT in the \ncase action en re: Guantanamo Detainee Cases, 355 Fed. Sup. Section \n443, 2005. The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia \ncriticized the way CSRTs required detainees to answer allegations based \non information that cannot be disclosed to the detainees. The Court \ndescribed what might be referred\n\n[[Page S10265]]\n\nto as a comical scene, where the detainee said he couldn't answer the \nallegations whether the detainee associated with a known al-Qaida \noperative because the tribunal could not provide the alleged \noperative's name.\n  The detainee said: Give me his name.\n  The tribunal said: I do not know.\n  The detainee said: How can I answer this?\n  The detainee's frustration reportedly led to laughter among all of \nthe tribunal's participants. And the District Court then said:\n\n       The laughter reflected in the transcript is understandable, \n     and this exchange might have been humorous had the \n     consequences of the detainee's enemy combatant status not \n     been so terribly serious and had the detainee's criticism of \n     the process not been so piercingly accurate.\n\n  How can you sanction that kind of a proceeding? If it is not a sham, \nit certainly is insufficient. As I reflect on it, it is more than \ninsufficient. It is, in fact, a sham.\n  When it was apparent that both the committee bill and the \nadministration's position was going to strike habeas corpus, the \nJudiciary Committee held on short notice a hearing on Monday. We had a \ndistinguished array of witnesses appear. LCDR Charles Swift was \npresent. The attorney who represented Hamdan before the Supreme Court \ngave very compelling evidence as to why habeas corpus was indispensable \nin order to have basic justice. Bruce Fein, ranking member of the \nReagan administration in the Justice Department, was emphatic on his \nconclusion about the need to retain habeas corpus. The very \ndistinguished retired U.S. Navy rear admiral, John Hutson, who is now \nthe dean of the Franklin Pierce Law Center, testified about his \nexperience and the importance of retaining habeas corpus. We called, as \na matter of balance, other witnesses: David Rivkin and Bradford A. \nBerenson.\n  I commend to my colleagues the testimony of Thomas B. Sullivan, LCDR \nCharles D. Swift, Bruce Fein, David B. Rivkin, Jr., Bradford A. \nBerenson, and John D. Hutson.\n  Mr. President, the testimony that was given by Thomas B. Sullivan was \nespecially poignant. Mr. Sullivan is a man in his late seventies. He \nwas U.S. Attorney for 4 years in the late 1970s. He has a distinguished \nlaw practice with Jenner & Block. He has been to Guantanamo on many \noccasions and has represented many people who are detained in \nGuantanamo.\n  His testimony was, as I say, especially poignant when he said that \nlong after all of those in the hearing room are dead, there would be an \napology made if habeas corpus is denied, just as the apology was made \nafter the detention of the Japanese in World War II being a denial of \nbasic and fundamental fairness, where we in the United States pride \nourselves on the rule of law.\n  He made reference to a number of individual cases where the \nproceedings before the Combat Status Review Tribunal were just totally \ninsufficient, reflecting hearings where individuals were called in, \nthey did not speak the language, they did not have an attorney, they \ndid not have access to the information which was presented against \nthem, and they were detained.\n\n  Mr. President, documentation presented to the committee speaks \neloquently and emphatically about the procedures which lack the most \nfundamental of due process. These individuals did not know what their \ncharges were; they were so vague and illusory, just like the detainee \nwho was alleged to have an al-Qaida associate. They wouldn't even \nproduce the man's name. How do you know what the charge is? Then they \ndon't have attorneys. Then they don't know what the evidence is. It is \nclassified, and they are not told what the evidence is.\n  This goes back, again, to Justice O'Connor's opinion where she says:\n\n       Habeas petitioners would have some opportunity to present \n     and rebut facts.\n\n  Well, how can you rebut facts when you do not know what the facts \nare? How can you rebut facts when the material is classified and you \nare not told what the alleged facts are? That is why it is so important \nthat the courts be open.\n  I have had considerable experience with habeas corpus when I was a \nprosecuting attorney. When a habeas corpus petition is presented, it \nrequires the government--the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania when I was \nDA--to take a close look at the case and to focus on it.\n  One of the matters that was inserted into the Record from Mr. \nSullivan, after he filed the petition for a writ of habeas corpus and \nwas proceeding to gather evidence to present it, he says:\n\n       Several months ago without notice to me and without \n     explanation, compensation, or apology, the United States \n     Government returned Mr. Abdul-Hadi al Siba to Saudi Arabia.\n\n  So when the Government had to defend, apparently they found out what \nthe case was about. When they had to find out what the case was about, \nthey sent the detainee back to Saudi Arabia.\n  But here we have a very explicit statement by Justice O'Connor about \nthe right to rebut the facts. It simply is not present in the \nproceedings which happened before the Combat Status Review Tribunal.\n  Kenneth Starr, formerly Solicitor General, formerly judge on the \nCourt of Appeals for the District of Columbia, could not be present at \nour hearing on Monday but submitted this letter dated September 24. I \nwill not read it in its entirety but only the first sentence where he \nsays:\n\n       I write to express my concerns about the limitation on writ \n     of habeas corpus contained in the comprehensive military \n     commissions bill.\n\n  Then, in the third paragraph, he cites article I, section 9, clause \n2, which I have referred to, about the privilege being suspended only \nin the case of invasion or rebellion, and again notes the obvious--that \nwe do not face either an invasion or rebellion.\n  Mr. President, how much time of my hour remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 21 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, that states the essence of the \nproposition.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I could just use such time as I want, I \nwill not take much because I am anxious for my colleagues to address \nthis issue.\n  The distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania made the statement that \nthey have constitutional rights. I wish to respectfully sort of differ \nwith the Senator. The Supreme Court, in the Rasul case, ruled that \nrights of aliens held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, 28 U.S.C, 2241--the \nCourt did not reach the question of the constitutional right of habeas \ncorpus that applies to a U.S. citizen; of course, they being aliens. In \nthe Rasul case, the Court interpreted the habeas corpus statute, \nsection 2241, to apply to an alien held at Guantanamo Bay. That holding \nis based in large part due to the unique long-term lease that the Court \ntook judicial notice of and other evidence brought before the Court, \nthe long-term lease tantamount to U.S. territory.\n  For more than 50 years, the Court held that aliens in military \ndetention outside the United States had no right to petition the \nFederal courts for review of their military detention. So I question \nwhether you can elevate that to a constitutional status.\n  Mr. SPECTER. If I may respond, Mr. President, I didn't cite Rasul v. \nBush for a constitutional proposition. I cited Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, and I \ncited the opinion of Justice O'Connor. But let me repeat it because it \nis the core consideration. She said:\n\n       All agree that absent suspicion the writ of habeas corpus \n     remains available to every individual detained within the \n     United States. Of course, that does include Guantanamo.\n\n  Then Justice O'Connor goes on to say:\n\n       United States Constitution, article I, section 9, clause 2, \n     privilege of writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended \n     unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public \n     safety requires it. Then she says that all agree that \nsuspension of the writ has not occurred here. Then she deals with the \nstatute, 2241, and makes the comment that it sets the procedures, but \nJustice O'Connor puts detention in the Hamdi case squarely on \nconstitutional grounds.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. There are a variety of divided opinions on that point.\n  At this time, I will regain the floor and discuss this issue. I am \nanxious to hear from my two colleagues, one from South Carolina and one \nfrom Texas, who seek recognition.\n\n[[Page S10266]]\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. If I might be recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield the floor on my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, what the distinguished chairman says is \naccurate about Rasul, but you have Hamdi, which puts it on \nconstitutional grounds. It is that simple.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield such time as the distinguished Senator from South \nCarolina desires.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, this debate is a strength, not a weakness, \nin our country.\n  In my opinion, the fundamental question for the Senate to answer when \nit comes to determining enemy combatant status is, Who should make that \ndetermination? Should that be a military decision or should it be a \njudicial decision?\n  I am firmly in the camp that when it comes to determining who an \nenemy of the United States is, one who has taken up arms and who \npresents a threat to our Nation, that is not something judges are \ntrained to do, nor should they be doing. That is something our military \nshould do.\n  For as long as I have been a military lawyer, Geneva Conventions \narticle 4, where it talks about a competent tribunal to decide whether \na person is a civilian--lawful, unlawful, combatant--that competent \ntribunal has been seen in terms of military people making those \ndecisions.\n  I have a tremendous respect for our courts. We will follow whatever \nthey tell Congress to do because we are a rule-of-law nation, but this \nCongress has a role to play.\n  Unlike my chairman, Senator Specter, I believe the question before \nthe Congress is not whether an enemy combatant noncitizen alien has a \nconstitutional right to habeas corpus because I don't believe that is \nwhat the court has said. The issue for the Congress is whether habeas \ncorpus rights should be given to an enemy combatant noncitizen under \nsection 2241 and whether the military should make the determination of \nwho an enemy combatant is versus judiciary.\n  What happens now is that when someone is brought to Guantanamo Bay, \nvery shortly after they arrive, the military will create a combat \nstatus review tribunal that is supposed to be compliant with article 4 \nof the Geneva Conventions, a competent tribunal.\n  When we look at the history of competent tribunals, normally they are \none person. We will have three people. Of the three people will be a \nmilitary intelligence officer--and it could be other officers within \nour military who have expertise in determining what the battlefield \nsituation is and who is involved with the enemy forces and who is not. \nThat tribunal has an evidentiary standard to meet. The tribunal must \nmake a finding by a preponderance of the evidence that the person \nbefore them indeed fits within the definition ``enemy combatant.'' \nThere is a rebuttal of presumption in favor of the Government's \nevidence.\n  Our Federal courts will have the opportunity shortly to determine \nwhether the combat status review tribunal is constitutional due \nprocess. The reason I say that is because under the Detainee Treatment \nAct we passed last year, every detainee at Guantanamo Bay will have \ntheir day in Federal court.\n  After the military renders their decision that they are an enemy \ncombatant, as a matter of right each person can go to the DC Circuit \nCourt of Appeals, and the Federal DC Circuit Court of Appeals will look \nat that case with two issues before them: Does this CSRT process, the \nannual review board, does it constitutionally pass muster as being \nadequate due process not only under the Geneva Conventions but under \nour Constitution to the extent it applies? Second, was the decision \nrendered by that board finding the person enemy combatant by the \npreponderance of the evidence--the standards and procedures involved, \ndo they pass muster? And in the individual case, did they get it right? \nThat is the structure for them to decide the issue set up in a \nconstitutionally sound manner.\n  The reason I oppose my chairman, for whom I have great respect, is \nbecause the habeas process is a doctrine that is normally associated \nwith criminal law, and we are in a war. The Japanese and German \nprisoners we interred in World War II never had access to our Federal \ncourts to bring lawsuits against the people who confined them--our own \ntroops--for a reason: it was a right not given in international law to \nan enemy prisoner, and it was not a right we gave to any prisoner we \nhave held in the history of our country consciously as Congress.\n  The problem in this case is the Government argued that Guantanamo Bay \nwas outside the jurisdiction of the United States. Why is it important? \nIt is clear that our habeas statutes do not apply overseas. The \nGovernment lost that argument. Chairman Specter is absolutely right. \nThe court said that for legal purposes, Guantanamo Bay falls within the \nconfines of the United States. Section 2241, the habeas statute, unless \nCongress says otherwise, will apply to this environment.\n  Now it is time for Congress to decide, in its wisdom, whether the \nFederal courts should be determining who an enemy combatant is through \na habeas action. Do we want that to reside in the military, where it \nhas been for our whole history, and allow Federal courts to review the \nmilitary decision, not substitute their judgment for the military?\n  It is not about who loves America and who is un-American. Mr. \nSullivan came to my office yesterday. He is a lawyer representing \ndetainees at Guantanamo Bay. He is a great American. He gave me four or \nfive stories about how his client appeared before the Combat Status \nReview Tribunal, and he had nothing but bad things to say about the way \nhis client was treated and the procedures in place.\n  Once a week, I get a call from somebody from South Carolina who says \ntheir family member was screwed in court. And then what I try to do is \nto make sure we listen to them respectfully but understand that there \nare a lot of complaints about any system.\n  Mr. Sullivan's complaints got me thinking, and I think there is a way \nto provide some remedies that do not exist now without substituting \njudges for military officers when it comes to wartime decisions. I will \nprivately talk to him about that.\n\n  I urge this Senate to think in broad terms. Do we really want to \nallow the Federal judiciary to have trials over every decision about \nwho an enemy combatant is or is not, taking that away from the \nmilitary? Do we really want the people who have been housed by our \nmilitary to bring every known lawsuit to man against the people \nfighting the war and protecting us?\n  I compliment Senator Specter because in this new version they take \nthe conditions of confinement lawsuits off the table. There are 400-\nsomething cases that have been filed arising from Guantanamo Bay \ndetention. There is a $300 million lawsuit against Secretary Rumsfeld. \nThere are allegations that people do not get enough exercise. It goes \non and on and on. Never in the history of warfare has the host country \nallowed an enemy prisoner to bring a court case against those people \nwho are fighting the enemy on behalf of the host country. That needs to \nstop.\n  I am urging this Senate to dismiss under 2241 the right of habeas \nactions by enemy prisoners so that judges will not take the role of the \nmilitary. Adopt anew what we did last year, allowing the military to \nuse a process that I believe is Geneva Conventions compliant, and then \nsome, and have as a backstop judicial review, where the DC Circuit \nCourt of Appeals can review the military's decision. That way, we will \nhave due process unknown to any other war. That will keep the roles of \nthe responsible parties intact. The role of the military in a time of \nwar, I earnestly believe, is to control the battlefield and to \ndesignate who is in bounds and out of bounds when it comes to the \nbattlefield. The role of the courts in a time of war is to pass muster \nand judgment over the processes we create--not substituting their \njudgment for the military but passing judgment over the infrastructure \nthe military uses to make these decisions.\n  The problem with this war--there is no capital to conquer, no navy to \nsink, no army to defeat. The people we are fighting owe an allegiance \nto an idea, not to a piece of property. They have no home to defend. \nThey have an idea they would like to sell, and they are\n\n[[Page S10267]]\n\nselling that idea, whether you want to buy it or not. They are selling \nit in a very brutal way. They are trying to get good and decent people \naccepting their view of the world because they are terrified of the way \nthe enemy behaves. This is a war unlike other wars in this regard. \nPeople do not wear uniforms, but the ideas the terrorists represent are \nnot unknown to mankind. Hitler wore a uniform. He had the same view of \nmankind as these people do: there are some people not worth living \nbecause they are different.\n  We have to adjust, but we do not need to change who we are. I am not \nasking this Senate to change who America is because we are fighting \nbarbarians. Quite honestly, we will never win this war if we move in \ntheir direction. Our goal is to get the world to move in our direction \nby practicing what we preach.\n  I believe the way to balance the interests of our need to protect \nourselves and to adhere to the rule of law is to apply the law of armed \nconflict, not criminal law.\n  The act of 9/11, in my opinion, was an act of war, not a crime. And \nthe problem with this country is the people we are fighting were at war \nwith us a long time before we knew we were at war with them. Now we are \nat war.\n  This administration, on occasion, in my opinion, has tried to cut the \ncorners of the law of armed conflict. I embrace the law of conflict. I \nwant to fully apply the actions of the United States. I embrace the \nGeneva Conventions. I want to apply it fully to the war we are fighting \neven though our enemy will not. But I am insistent, with my vote and \nwith my time in this Senate, that we fight the war and not criminalize \nthe war.\n  No enemy prisoner should have access to Federal courts--a noncitizen, \nenemy combatant terrorist--to bring a lawsuit against those fighting on \nour behalf. No judge should have the ability to make a decision that \nhas been historically reserved to the military. That does not make us \nsafer.\n  There is due process in place for the enemy combatants at Guantanamo \nBay, Afghanistan, and Iraq that I believe is Geneva Conventions \ncompliant. There is judicial review consistent with the military being \nthe lead agency. I urge this Senate to adopt that and to reject this \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Will the Senator from South Carolina respond to a \nquestion?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I will try.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I direct an inquiry to my colleague from South Carolina. \nWould the Senator respond to the question?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes. I will try my best.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I didn't want you to yield for a question because I \ndidn't want to interrupt your presentation.\n  I begin by complimenting the Senator from South Carolina for his \nexcellent work. He and Senator Warner and Senator McCain have done \nexemplary work in maintaining the Geneva Conventions and appropriate \nrules and to classify evidence.\n  When you talk about constitutional issues and you talk about section \n2241, I agree with the Senator, but how do you deal with the flat terms \nof the Constitution, ``the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall \nnot be suspended unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion public \nsafety may require it''? How do you deal with that if you do not have \nrebellion?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. Chairman, I guess one could make that argument. I \nhave been assuming something from the beginning--that the Court's \ndecision in Rasul and Hamdi is a statement by the Court that because \nGuantanamo Bay falls within the jurisdiction of the United States, it \nis section 2241 that we are dealing with. It is a statutory right of \nhabeas that has been granted to enemy combatants. And if there is a \nconstitutional right of habeas corpus given to enemy combatants, that \nis a totally different endeavor, and it would change in many ways what \nI have said.\n\n  I do not know what the Court will decide, but if the Court does say \nin the next round of legal appeals there is a constitutional right to \nhabeas corpus by those detained at Guantanamo Bay, then the Senator is \nabsolutely right. We would have to make a different legal \ndetermination. We would have to make a different legal analysis. And if \nthe Court does that, I will sit down with the Senator and we will \nfigure out how to work through that.\n  I am just being as honest with the Senator as I know how to be. I \nthink this is a statutory problem, not a constitutional problem.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Well, Mr. President, the distinguished chairman of the \nArmed Services Committee says he does not want to come back and \nlegislate again. If this bill is passed, we will be right back here at \na later date.\n  When the Senator from South Carolina says it is not on constitutional \ngrounds, the plain English of the decision says it is. But let me ask \nthe Senator one further question; that is, you fought hard to have \nclassified evidence available in the trials, albeit a war crimes trial. \nAnd you have Justice O'Connor saying they have to have the opportunity \nto rebut facts. When these proceedings are handled so much on \nclassified information the detainees cannot see, would it not be \nconsistent with your approach on classified information generally to at \nleast have them know something about the charge so they can rebut the \nfacts?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. If I may, I would invite the chairman--I cannot remember \nwhat paragraph the language is in, but Justice O'Connor gave some \nguidance to the military--I think it is Army Regulation 190-dash-\nsomething--that she indicated would be a proper mechanism or at least a \nguide of how to set up due process rights for this administrative \ndetermination. So after that decision, I know the military looked at \nthe Army regulation that she cited and built the CSRT process off that \nconcept. I am of the opinion that the Combat Status Review Tribunal \ndoes afford the rights Justice O'Connor indicated and is more than the \nArmy regulation would allow that she cited, and it is fully compliant \nwith article 5 of the Geneva Conventions--competent tribunal--but if \nyou look in that decision, she mentions an Army regulation as a guide \nas to how to do this. I think the military, the Department of Defense, \nhas gone beyond that.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Well, Mr. President, there is flexibility, I agree, but \nthe determination as to whether that flexibility is adequate is up to \nthe Court. That is what the Supreme Court has said.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Chair.\n  I would say to my colleague, there is an interesting thing we best \nwatch here as we are trying to determine the rights of these people \nbecause it seems to me if there is such a fundamental right of \nconstitutionality attached to this thing, then someone might argue: \nWell, if it is actionable in Guantanamo--this lease thing is to me a \nfairly weak basis on which to do it--what about 18,000 in our custody \nin Iraq now? So we just better exercise a little caution as we begin to \nuse that because if we begin to extend habeas corpus to 18,000 in Iraq, \nwe have a problem.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I stipulate that Senator Warner is right \nabout Iraq on this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I have a longer presentation, but what I \nwould like to do is respond specifically to the argument Senator \nSpecter is now making, and then Senator Cornyn has longer remarks to \nmake.\n  Let me begin by saying that I have the utmost respect for the \nchairman of the committee, my friend, the Senator from Pennsylvania. \nAnd he is entitled to be wrong once in a while. In this matter, he is \nwrong. It was testimony before the committee on Monday that verifies \nthat this is not a constitutional issue with respect to aliens. It is \nonly a constitutional issue with respect to citizens.\n  This legislation has nothing to do with citizens. The decision cited \nby the Senator from Pennsylvania is the Hamdi decision, which dealt \nwith a U.S. citizen. And, of course, the writ of habeas corpus applies \nto U.S. citizens. Our legislation does not.\n  Here is what David Rivkin, a partner at Baker & Hostetler law firm, \ntestified to on Monday. He said in this legislation:\n\n       We are giving [alien enemy combatants] a lot more . . . \n     than they are legally entitled to under either international \n     [law] or the law in the U.S. constitution.\n\n\n[[Page S10268]]\n\n\n  Now, let me just proceed from that. Our Supreme Court has held that \nU.S. constitutional protections do not apply to aliens held outside of \nour borders. The Johnson v. Eisentrager case, for example, rejected the \nview that the U.S. Constitution applies to enemy war prisoners held \nabroad, saying:\n\n       No decision of this Court supports such a view. None of the \n     learned commentators on our Constitution has ever hinted at \n     it. The practice of every modern government is opposed to it.\n\n  In 1990, the Supreme Court reaffirmed this view in the Verdugo case, \nsaying:\n\n       [W]e have rejected the claim that aliens are entitled to \n     Fifth Amendment rights outside the sovereign territory of the \n     United States.\n\n  That case also makes it clear that constitutional protections do not \nextend to aliens detained in this country who have no substantial \nconnection to this country. The Supreme Court there said that aliens \n``receive constitutional protections when they have come within the \nterritory of the United States and developed substantial connections \nwith this country.''\n  The Verdugo Court further clarified that ``lawful but involuntary'' \npresence in the United States ``is not of the sort to indicate any \nsubstantial connection with our country.''\n  Now, the Rasul case took great pains to emphasize that its extension \nof habeas to Guantanamo Bay was only statutory. Some Justices may have \nwanted to make Rasul a constitutional holding, but there was no \nmajority for such a ruling.\n  So both Eisentrager and Verdugo are still the governing law in this \narea. These precedents hold that aliens who are either held abroad or \nheld here but have no other substantial connection to this country are \nnot entitled to invoke the U.S. Constitution.\n  As committee witness Brad Berenson noted at Monday's hearing:\n\n       [N]othing in the Constitution, including the Suspension \n     Clause, confers rights of access to our courts for alien \n     enemy combatants being held in the ordinary course of armed \n     conflict.\n\n  He also refuted the argument that constitutional rights of habeas for \nenemy combatants is embedded in the Rasul decision. As he explained \nbefore, going through the logic of that opinion and its dependence on \nthe 1973 Braden case, and I am quoting:\n\n       If there were a constitutional right to habeas corpus \n     relief for alien enemies held abroad, the implication would \n     thus be that it sprang into existence some time after 1973, \n     if not just two years ago in 2004, and received no mention in \n     Rasul. No matter how robust a concept of the ``living \n     Constitution'' one embraces, this sort of Miracle-Gro \n     Constitution cannot fit within it.\n\n  He was trying to be clever there to point out the fact that never has \nthe Court come close to holding that for alien enemy combatants there \nis a constitutional right of habeas. And no decision of the Supreme \nCourt has ever grounded its decision on the Constitution--only the case \nwith respect to U.S. citizens.\n  So I do not fear the Supreme Court overturning what we are trying to \ndo here. One never knows what the Court might do. And Senator Specter \ncertainly is correct that if it did, we would have to revisit this \nissue. I am totally confident, however, that this legislation would be \nupheld and certainly not be declared unconstitutional based upon a view \nthat the habeas provisions apply to alien enemy combatants.\n  Mr. President, the Specter amendment strikes at the heart of the \nlitigation reforms in this bill--it undercuts the entire bill. The \namendment would undercut and override the carefully calibrated \naccountability and supervision mechanisms negotiated by the Armed \nServices committee. And it would give enemy soldiers challenging their \ndetention unprecedented access to our courts. It should be strongly \nopposed.\n  Under the MCA, detainees already receive extremely generous process \nwithout habeas corpus lawsuits.\n  Every detainee held at Guantanamo currently receives a Combatant \nStatus Review Tribunal (CSRT) review of his detention. The CSRT process \nis modeled on and closely tracks the Article 5 hearings conducted under \nthe Geneva Conventions. In the 2004 Hamdi decision, the Supreme Court \ncited Article 5 hearings as an example of the type of hearing that \nwould be adequate to justify detention of even an American citizen who \nhas engaged in war against the United States. Moreover, under the \nGeneva Conventions, Article 5 hearings are given to detainees only when \nthere is substantial doubt as to their status. In all American wars, \nonly a small percentage of detainees have ever been given Article 5 \nhearings. Yet at Guantanamo, we have given a CSRT hearing to every \ndetainee who has been brought there. And finally, it bears emphasis \nthat the CSRT gives unlawful enemy combatants even more procedural \nprotections than the Geneva Conventions' Article 5 hearing give to \nlawful enemy combatants. For example:\n\n       A CSRT provides a detainee with a personal representative \n     to help him prepare his case. An Article 5 tribunal does not.\n       Under the CSRT procedure, the hearing officer is required \n     to search government files for ``evidence to suggest that the \n     detainee should not be designated as an enemy combatant.'' An \n     Article 5 tribunal provides no such right.\n       CSRTs give the detainee a summary of the evidence \n     supporting his detention in advance of the hearing. Article 5 \n     tribunals do not.\n       CSRTs are subject to review by supervising authorities and \n     may be remanded for further review. Article 5 provides no \n     such rights.\n\n  Finally, after a CSRT is completed, the Detainee Treatment Act, DTA, \nand the Military Commissions Act, MCA, give an al-Qaida detainee the \nright to appeal the result to the DC Circuit. That circuit--staffed by \nsome of the best judges in this country--is then authorized to make \nsure that all proper procedures were followed in the CSRT hearing, and \nto judge whether the CSRT process is consistent with the Constitution \nand with federal statutes--though no treaty lawsuits are authorized, \npursuant to long-standing precedent.\n  Now I would grant, the DTA does not allow re-examination of the facts \nunderlying a prisoner's detention, and it limits the review to the \nadministrative record. I commented on these provisions more extensively \nin remarks submitted for the Record on December 21. But as committee \nwitness Brad Berenson noted at Monday's Judiciary Committee hearing, \nquoting the Supreme Court's 2001 decision in St. Cyr, ``the traditional \nrule on habeas corpus review of non-criminal executive detentions was \nthat `the courts generally did not review the factual determinations \nmade by the executive.' '' And under the original common-law writ of \nhabeas corpus, the facts in the custodian's return could not be \ncontested. Thus, although the DTA does not allow sufficiency-of-the-\nevidence challenges, neither did the common law writ of habeas corpus--\nespecially for noncriminal executive detentions. DTA review is \nlimited--it has to be, or we would face the same litigation burdens as \nunder the Rasul-inspired litigation. But common-law habeas itself is a \nlimited remedy. Under the DTA, prisoners are not denied anything that \nthey would have been entitled to under the original common-law writ of \nhabeas corpus.\n  Moreover, the fact that we are letting detainees go to court to \nchallenge their conviction is totally unprecedented. At a hearing held \non Monday before the Judiciary Committee, one of the witnesses who \nopposes the MCA, Rear Admiral John Hutson, nevertheless conceded in his \ntestimony that ``[i]n World War II, when thousands and thousands of \nGerman and Italian POWs were imprisoned in various camps throughout the \nUnited States . . . there is only one recorded case of a POW using \nhabeas to test his imprisonment. He was an Italian American and his \npetition was denied.''\n  Just to be clear: there were 425,000 enemy combatants held in the \nUnited States during World War II. Yet according to Senator Specter's \nown witness at his Judiciary Committee hearing, only one habeas \npetition challenging detention was filed--and that was filed by an \nAmerican citizen. The MCA only applies to aliens--not American \ncitizens, so even that case would not have been affected by this bill.\n  World War II did see several petitions challenging military trials, \nbut the MCA and the DTA also allow judicial review of military \ncommissions.\n  At Senator Specter's September 25, 2006, hearing on the MCA before \nthe Judiciary Committee, committee witness Brad Berenson, a partner at \nthe Sidley & Austin law firm, testified that ``[n]o nation on the face \nof the earth in any previous conflict has given people they\n\n[[Page S10269]]\n\nhave captured anything like [the procedures provided by CSRTs and the \nDTA], and none does so today.'' Mr. Berenson reiterated: The MCA's \nprocedures ``are in fact more generous than anything we or any other \nnation in the history of the world has previously afforded to our \nmilitary adversaries.''\n  At the same hearing--Senator Specter's hearing on the MCA on Monday--\nwe also heard from David Rivkin, a partner at the Baker & Hostetler law \nfirm. This is what he had to say: ``[t]he level of due process that \nthese detainees are getting [under CSRTs and the DTA] far exceeds the \nlevel of due process accorded to any combatants, captured combatants, \nlawful or unlawful, in any war in human history.'' Mr. Rivkin added: \n``We are giving [alien enemy combatants] a lot more . . . than they are \nlegally entitled to under either international [law] or the law in the \nU.S. Constitution.''\n  The Supreme Court has held that U.S. constitutional protections do \nnot apply to aliens held outside of our borders. For example, in \nJohnson v. Eisentrager (1950), the Supreme Court rejected the view that \nthe U.S. Constitution applies to enemy war prisoners held abroad, \nnoting that ``[n]o decision of this Court supports such a view. None of \nthe learned commentators on our Constitution has ever hinted at it. The \npractice of every modern government is opposed to it.'' In 1990, the \nSupreme Court reaffirmed this view in the Verdugo case, holding that \n``we have rejected the claim that aliens are entitled to Fifth \nAmendment rights outside the sovereign territory of the United \nStates.''\n  The Verdugo case also makes clear that constitutional protections do \nnot extend to aliens detained in this country who have no substantial \nconnection to this country. The Supreme Court noted that aliens \n``receive constitutional protections when they have come within the \nterritory of the United States and developed substantial connections \nwith this country.'' The Verdugo Court further clarified that ``lawful \nbut involuntary'' presence in the United States ``is not of the sort to \nindicate any substantial connection with our country.'' That is United \nStates v. Verdugo-Urquidez, 494 U.S. 259 (1990).\n  Rasul v. Bush took great pains to emphasize that its extension of \nhabeas to Guantanamo Bay was only statutory. Some Justices may have \nwanted to make Rasul a constitutional holding, but there clearly was no \nmajority for such a ruling.\n  Eisentrager and Verdugo are still the governing law in this area. \nThese precedents hold that aliens who are either held abroad, or held \nhere but have no other substantial connection to this country, are not \nentitled to invoke the U.S. Constitution. As committee witness Brad \nBerenson noted at Monday's hearing, ``nothing in the Constitution, \nincluding the Suspension Clause, confers rights of access to our courts \nfor alien enemy combatants being held in the ordinary course of an \narmed conflict.'' Berenson also refuted the argument that a \nconstitutional right of habeas for enemy combatants is embedded in the \nRasul decision. As he explained, going through the logic of that \nopinion and its dependence on the 1973 Braden case:\n\n       If there were a constitutional right to habeas corpus \n     relief for alien enemies held abroad, the implication would \n     thus be that it sprang into existence some time after 1973, \n     if not just two years ago in 2004, and received no mention in \n     Rasul. No matter how robust a concept of the ``living \n     Constitution'' one embraces, this sort of Miracle-Gro \n     Constitution cannot fit within it.\n\n  The Specter amendment would have led to a nightmare of litigation in \nother wars.\n  During World War II, the United States held millions of axis enemy \ncombatants. During some periods, enemy war prisoners were shipped into \nthis country at the rate of 60,000 a month. By the end of the war, over \n425,000 enemy war prisoners were detained in prison camps inside the \nUnited States. Overall, the United States detained over two million \nenemy combatants during World War II. Prisoner camps for these \ncombatants existed in all but three of the then-48 states.\n  If the Specter amendment had been law during World War II, all of \nthese 2 million enemy combatants would have been allowed to file habeas \ncorpus lawsuits in Federal district court against our Armed Forces. \nJust try to imagine what that would have meant. The vast majority of \nthese 2 million enemy prisoners were not familiar with the American \nlegal system and did not speak English. If they had habeas corpus \nrights, they surely would have had to be provided with a lawyer in \norder to effectuate those rights. Also, should each of these 2 million \nprisoners also have been given access to the classified evidence that \nmight be used against them to justify their detention? Should all 2 \nmillion of these prisoners have been entitled to call witnesses on \ntheir behalf? Should they have been allowed to recall the U.S. soldiers \nat the front who captured them, and to cross examine them?\n  The consequences of the Specter amendment are unimaginable. We cannot \nallow enemy war prisoners to sue us in our own courts. Such a system \nwould make it simply impossible for the United States to fight a war. \nBut don't take my word for it. The United States Supreme Court came to \nthe same conclusion in its landmark decision in Johnson v. Eisentrager. \nThe Supreme Court in that case clearly and eloquently explained why we \ncannot allow alien enemy combatants to sue our military in our courts:\n\n       A basic consideration in habeas corpus practice is that the \n     prisoner will be produced before the court. This is the crux \n     of the statutory scheme established by the Congress; indeed, \n     it is inherent in the very term ``habeas corpus.'' And though \n     production of the prisoner may be dispensed with where it \n     appears on the face of the application that no cause for \n     granting the writ exists, Walker v. Johnston, we have \n     consistently adhered to and recognized the general rule. \n     Ahrens v. Clark. To grant the writ to these prisoners might \n     mean that our army must transport them across the seas for \n     hearing. This would require allocation of shipping space, \n     guarding personnel, billeting and rations. It might also \n     require transportation for whatever witnesses the prisoners \n     desired to call as well as transportation for those necessary \n     to defend legality of the sentence. The writ, since it is \n     held to be a matter of right, would be equally available to \n     enemies during active hostilities as in the present twilight \n     between war and peace. Such trials would hamper the war \n     effort and bring aid and comfort to the enemy. They would \n     diminish the prestige of our commanders, not only with \n     enemies but with wavering neutrals. It would be difficult to \n     devise more effective fettering of a field commander than to \n     allow the very enemies he is ordered to reduce to submission \n     to call him to account in his own civil courts and divert his \n     efforts and attention from the military offensive abroad to \n     the legal defensive at home. Nor is it unlikely that the \n     result of such enemy litigiousness would be a conflict \n     between judicial and military opinion highly comforting to \n     enemies of the United States.\n\n  The Specter Amendment would disrupt the operation of Guantanamo and \nundermine the war on terror. We already know that habeas litigation at \nGuantanamo has consumed enormous resources and disrupted day-to-day \noperation of the base. The United States February 17, 2006 Supplemental \nBrief in the Al Odah case in the DC circuit describes the burdens \nimposed on the military by the Guantanamo litigation and the frivolous \nnature of some of the claims being pursued. At pages 12-14, the brief \ndescribes the following:\n\n  According to the Justice Department: ``The detainees have urged \nhabeas courts to dictate conditions on [Guantanamo Naval] Base ranging \nfrom the speed of Internet access afforded their lawyers to the extent \nof mail delivered to the detainees;'' More than 200 cases have been \nfiled on behalf of 600 purported detainees. This number exceeds the \nnumber of detainees actually held at Guantanamo, which is near 500; \nAlso according to the Justice Department: ``The Department of Defense \nhas been forced to reconfigure its operations at Guantanamo Naval Base \nto accommodate hundreds of visits by private habeas counsel. . . . This \nhabeas litigation has consumed enormous resources and disrupted the \nday-to-day operation of Guantanamo Naval Base;'' The United States also \nnotes that this litigation has had a serious negative impact on the war \nwith Al Qaeda. According to the U.S. brief:\n\n       Perhaps most disturbing, the habeas litigation has \n     imperiled crucial military operations during a time of war. \n     In some instances, habeas counsel have violated protective \n     orders and jeopardized the security of the base by giving \n     detainees information likely to cause unrest. Moreover, \n     habeas counsel have frustrated interrogation critical to \n     preventing further terrorist attacks on the United States. \n     One of the coordinating counsel for the detainees boasted \n     about this in public:\n\n[[Page S10270]]\n\n       The litigation is brutal for [the United States.] It's \n     huge. We have over one hundred lawyers now from big and small \n     firms working to represent the detainees. Every time an \n     attorney goes down there, it makes it that much harder [for \n     the U.S. military] to do what they're doing. You can't run an \n     interrogation . . . with attorneys. What are they going to do \n     now that we're getting court orders to get more lawyers down \n     there?\n\n  Brad Berenson, who testified at the September 25 Judiciary Committee \nhearing on this bill, offers what I think is a fitting comment on the \nhabeas corpus litigation at Guantanamo Bay thus far. He concluded his \ntestimony by noting, ``All freedom-loving people cherish the Great \nWrit. But we debase the writ, rather than honor it, if we extend it \ninto realms where neither history nor tradition support its use.''\n  At Monday's Judiciary Committee hearing, some witness suggested that \nthe bulk of the detainees held at Guantanamo are innocent. One witness \nat Monday's Judiciary Committee hearing, a lawyer who represents 10 \nSaudis held at Guantanamo, went so far as to assert that ``none of the \nten . . . are enemies of the United States.'' This lawyer even told us \nthat the men at Guantanamo ``do not appear any more dangerous . . . \nthan my younger grandchild, who is 12.'' Another witness at the \nJudiciary Committee's September 25 hearing asserted that ``[n]ot a \ncrumb of evidence has been adduced suggesting that the writ would risk \nfreeing terrorists to return to fight against the United States.''\n  This characterization, and similar assertions that the bulk of the \ndetainees at Guantanamo are innocent, simply do not comport with \nreality. The United States has already released a number of detainees. \nThese are detainees who our own Armed Forces decided were not enemy \ncombatants or were no longer dangerous. Our Armed Forces are obviously \nvery cautious about whom they release--they have great reason to be \ncautious, since they bear the consequences of releasing anyone who is a \nthreat. Yet we already know that even among those detainees whom our \nArmed Forces thought were not dangerous, a significant number instead \nturned out to remain committed to war against the United States and its \nallies. According to a October 22, 2004 story in the Washington Post, \nat least 10 detainees released from Guantanamo have been recaptured or \nkilled fighting U.S. or coalition forces in Afghanistan or Pakistan. \nThis is what the Washington Post described:\n\n       One of the repatriated prisoners is still at large after \n     taking leadership of a militant faction in Pakistan and \n     aligning himself with al Qaeda, Pakistani officials said. In \n     telephone calls to Pakistani reporters, he has bragged that \n     he tricked his U.S. interrogators into believing he was \n     someone else.\n       Another returned captive is an Afghan teenager who had \n     spent two years at a special compound for young detainees at \n     the military prison in Cuba, where he learned English, played \n     sports and watched videos, informed sources said. U.S. \n     officials believed they had persuaded him to abandon his life \n     with the Taliban, but recently the young man, now 18, was \n     recaptured with other Taliban fighters near Kandahar, \n     Afghanistan, according to the sources, who asked for \n     anonymity because they were discussing sensitive military \n     information.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       The latest case emerged two weeks ago when two Chinese \n     engineers working on a dam project in Pakistan's lawless \n     Waziristan region were kidnapped. The commander of a tribal \n     militant group, Abdullah Mehsud, 29, told reporters by \n     satellite phone that his followers were responsible for the \n     abductions.\n       Mehsud said he spent two years at Guantanamo Bay after \n     being captured in 2002 in Afghanistan fighting alongside the \n     Taliban. At the time he was carrying a false Afghan identity \n     card, and while in custody he maintained the fiction that he \n     was an innocent Afghan tribesman, he said. U.S. officials \n     never realized he was a Pakistani with deep ties to militants \n     in both countries, he added.\n       I managed to keep my Pakistani identity hidden all these \n     years,'' he told Gulf News in a recent interview. Since his \n     return to Pakistan in March, Pakistani newspapers have \n     written lengthy accounts of Mehsud's hair and looks, and the \n     powerful appeal to militants of his fiery denunciations of \n     the United States. ``We would fight America and its allies,'' \n     he said in one interview, ``until the very end.''\n       Last week Pakistani commandos freed one of the abducted \n     Chinese engineers in a raid on a mud-walled compound in which \n     five militants and the other hostage were killed.\n       The 10 or more returning militants are but a fraction of \n     the 202 Guantanamo Bay detainees who have been returned to \n     their homelands. Of that group, 146 were freed outright, and \n     56 were transferred to the custody of their home governments. \n     Many of those men have since been freed.\n       Mark Jacobson, a former special assistant for detainee \n     policy in the Defense Department who now teaches at Ohio \n     State University, estimated that as many as 25 former \n     detainees have taken up arms again. ``You can't trust them \n     when they say they're not terrorists,'' he said.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Another former Guantanamo Bay prisoner was killed in \n     southern Afghanistan last month after a shootout with Afghan \n     forces. Maulvi Ghafar was a senior Taliban commander when he \n     was captured in late 2001. No information has emerged about \n     what he told interrogators in Guantanamo Bay, but in several \n     cases U.S. officials have released detainees they knew to \n     have served with the Taliban if they swore off violence in \n     written agreements.\n       Returned to Afghanistan in February, Ghafar resumed his \n     post as a top Taliban commander, and his forces ambushed and \n     killed a U.N. engineer and three Afghan soldiers, Afghan \n     officials said, according to news accounts.\n       A third released Taliban commander died in an ambush this \n     summer. Mullah Shahzada, who apparently convinced U.S. \n     officials that he had sworn off violence, rejoined the \n     Taliban as soon as he was freed in mid-2003, sources with \n     knowledge of his situation said.\n\n  I urge that anyone consider these facts before contending that the \nbulk of the detainees at Guantanamo are ``innocent.''\n  I would also like to respond to some of the attacks that have been \nmade on the underlying DTA. One of the complaints made is that there is \nno mandate in the DTA, or in the MCA, that the military conduct CSRTs \nfor enemy combatants that it captures. In a September 25 letter to \nSenators, for example, the ACLU urges opposition to the MCA on the \nground, among other things, that ``[w]hile the bill does allow limited \nappeals for those who do go before a military commission or a Combatant \nStatus Review Tribunal, CSRT, there is no guarantee that any person \ndetained by our government be provided with either a trial or a CSRT.'' \nSimilarly, at the September 25 hearing before the Judiciary Committee, \ncommittee witness Bruce Fein argued against the MCA on the ground ``the \nfact is that the statute would enable the executive branch to simply \ndecline to hold CSRT proceedings . . . [I]t gives the executive branch, \nif it wishes, [the right] to hold detainees indefinitely without any \naccess to the Federal courts. [Military commanders could] say, we do \nnot want to hold a Combatant Status Review Tribunal, it is so clear \nthat they [the detainees] are enemy combatants. If they do not hold the \ntribunal hearing, there is no access to Federal courts under the \nstatute.''\n\n  My response to these critics is that what they have described does \naccurately describes the DTA and MCA--and also the Geneva Conventions. \nAs I noted earlier, the Geneva Conventions require an Article 5 hearing \non the status of a detainee, but only if there is doubt as to his \nstatus. Under the Geneva Conventions, I would submit, there is no need \nfor any Article 5 hearing for any of the al-Qaida and Taliban \ndetainees, because there is simply no question that these detainees are \nnot entitled to privileged status under the Geneva Conventions. The \nConventions allow the military to make blanket determinations, and our \nnation would certainly be within its rights to do so here. What the \nmilitary currently is doing for Guantanamo detainees goes well beyond \nthe process to which they are entitled. What these critics want \nCongress to apply to our Armed Forces is a rule of no good deed goes \nunpunished. Because the military, in response to criticism of \nGuantanamo, started giving everyone at Guantanamo a CSRT hearing, these \ncritics contend, it should be compelled to do so for all future \ndetainees, and for all future wars. What is now given as a matter of \nexecutive grace, they contend, should be transformed into a legislative \nmandate.\n  This the Armed Services committees and this congress declined to do. \nAside from the fact that these detainees, aliens all, are not entitled \nto CSRTs or any Article 5 type hearing under the Geneva Conventions, it \nwould be absurdly impractical to require the military to provide such \nhearings in all future conflicts. Consider, for example, the case of \nWorld War II. As I mentioned earlier, the United States detained over \n2,000,000 enemy combatants during that conflict. How on earth could we \npossibly expect the military to conduct CSRTs for 2 million people?\n\n[[Page S10271]]\n\nAnd how could the DC Circuit be expected to handle 2 million appeals \nfrom CSRTs, even under the de minimis facial challenge authorized by \nthe DTA? It is simply inconceivable.\n  The CSRTs and DTA review, I concede, would be insufficient to justify \ndetention of a United States citizen accused of a crime. This is not \ncivilian criminal justice due process. But these detainees are not \nentitled to civilian criminal justice due process. Nor are they \nentitled to such hearings under the Geneva Conventions.\n  What the DTA review standards do offer is judicial review that is \nconsistent with military needs and with the executive branch's primacy \namong the branches of government in the conduct of war. It is judicial \nreview in keeping with the traditional limited role of the courts in \nreviewing the conduct of war. As others have noted, DTA judicial review \nis limited to two narrow inquiries: did the CSRTs and commissions use \nthe standards and procedures identified by the Secretary of Defense, \nand is the use of these systems to either continue the detention of \nenemy combatants or try them for war crimes consistent with the \nConstitution and federal statutes? The first inquiry I think is \nstraightforward: did the military follow its own rules? This inquiry \ndoes not ask whether the military reached the correct result by \napplying its rules or whether a judge agrees that the evidence meets \nsome particular standard of evidence. The inquiry is simply whether the \ncorrect rule was employed.\n  Former United States Attorney General Bill Barr, in his testimony \nbefore the Senate Judiciary Committee on June 15 of last year, \ndescribed the understanding of judicial review of military decisions \nthat the DTA's review standards are designed to reflect:\n\n       It seems to me that the kinds of military decisions at \n     issue here--namely, what and who poses a threat to our \n     military operations--are quintessentially Executive in \n     nature. They are not amenable to the type of process we \n     employ in the domestic law enforcement arena. They cannot be \n     reduced to neat legal formulas, purely objective tests and \n     evidentiary standards. They necessarily require the exercise \n     of prudential judgment and the weighing of risks. This is one \n     of the reasons why the Constitution vests ultimate military \n     decision-making in the President as Commander-in-Chief. If \n     the concept of Commander-in-Chief means anything, it must \n     mean that the office holds the final authority to direct how, \n     and against whom, military power is to be applied to achieve \n     the military and political objectives of the campaign.\n       I am not speaking here of ``deference'' to Presidential \n     decisions. In some contexts, courts are fond of saying that \n     they ``owe deference'' to some Executive decisions. But this \n     suggests that the court has the ultimate decision-making \n     authority and is only giving weight to the judgment of the \n     Executive. This is not a question of deference--the point \n     here is that the ultimate substantive decision rests with the \n     President and that courts have no authority to substitute \n     their judgments for that of the President.\n\n  I think that last point is worth emphasizing. The DTA is not an \ninvitation for the courts to substitute their judgment for that of the \nmilitary. It is not for the courts to decide if someone is an enemy \ncombatant, regardless of the standard of review. It is simply not the \nrole of the courts to make that decision. It is not the courts, after \nall, who bear the burden of capturing an enemy combatant again if he is \nreleased and rejoins the battle. The only thing the DTA asks the courts \nto do is check that the record of the CSRT hearings reflect that the \nmilitary has used its own rules. It is up to the military to decide \nwhat the result should be under those rules, or even how those rules \nshould be modified in the future.\n  I would also reiterate a few words about the legality review that the \nDTA provides. This provision authorizes, in effect, a facial challenge \nto the CSRTs. I anticipate that once the District of Columbia circuit \ndecides these questions with regard to a particular set of CSRT \nprocedures in use, that decision will operate as circuit precedent \nunless and until the CSRT procedures are changed. Based on the long \nbody of Supreme Court precedent governing judicial review of military \naffairs, I do not anticipate that any type of hearing is required by \nthe Constitution or by Federal statute in order for the military to be \nallowed to detain alien enemy combatants. The Geneva Conventions do \nrequire hearings when there is doubt as to a detainee's privileged \nstatus, but those Conventions are not enforced through the courts, and \nthe DTA does not disturb that limit on judicial enforceability. Allow \nme to quote the previous understanding of the scope of judicial review \nof military-commission trials that the DTA is designed to embody, as \nexpressed in the Supreme Court's landmark decision in Johnson v. \nEisentrager:\n\n       It is not for us to say whether these prisoners were or \n     were not guilty of a war crime, or whether if we were to \n     retry the case we would agree to the findings of fact or the \n     application of the laws of war made by the Military \n     Commission. The petition shows that these prisoners were \n     formally accused of violating the laws of war and fully \n     informed of particulars of these charges. As we observed in \n     the Yamashita case, ``If the military tribunals have lawful \n     authority to hear, decide and condemn, their action is not \n     subject to judicial review merely because they have made a \n     wrong decision on disputed facts. Correction of their \n     errors of decision is not for the courts but for the \n     military authorities which are alone authorized to review \n     their decisions. We consider here only the lawful power of \n     the commission to try the petitioner for the offense \n     charged.''\n\n  Finally, I would like to reiterate the most important reason why I \nbelieve that Congress needs to bring an end to the habeas litigation \ninvolving war-on-terror detainees. Keeping captured terrorists out of \nthe court system is a prerequisite for conducting effective and \nproductive interrogation. And it is interrogation of terrorist \ndetainees that has proved to be an important source of critical \nintelligence that has saved American lives.\n  Giving detainees access to federal judicial proceedings threatens to \nseriously undermine vital U.S. intelligence-gathering activities. Under \nthe new Rasul-imposed system, shortly after al-Qaida and Taliban \ndetainees arrive at Guantanamo Bay, they are informed that they have \nthe right to challenge their detention in Federal court and the right \nto see a lawyer. Detainees overwhelmingly have exercised both rights. \nThe lawyers inevitably tell detainees not to talk to interrogators. \nAlso, mere notice of the availability of these proceedings gives \ndetainees hope that they can win release through adversary litigation, \nrather than by cooperating with their captors.\n  Navy Vice-Admiral Lowell Jacoby addressed this matter in a \ndeclaration attached to the United States's brief in the Padilla \nlitigation in the Southern District of New York. Vice-Admiral Jacoby at \nthe time was the Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency. He noted \nin the Declaration that:\n\n       DIA's approach to interrogation is largely dependent upon \n     creating an atmosphere of dependency and trust between the \n     subject and the interrogator. Developing the kind of \n     relationship of trust and dependency necessary for effective \n     interrogations is a process that can take a significant \n     amount of time. There are numerous examples of situations \n     where interrogators have been unable to obtain valuable \n     intelligence from a subject until months, or, even years, \n     after the interrogation process began.\n       Anything that threatens the perceived dependency and trust \n     between the subject and interrogator directly threatens the \n     value of interrogation as an intelligence gathering tool. \n     Even seemingly minor interruptions can have profound \n     psychological impacts on the delicate subject-interrogator \n     relationship. Any insertion of counsel into the subject-\n     interrogator relationship, for example--even if only for a \n     limited duration or for a specific purpose--can undo months \n     of work and may permanently shut down the interrogation \n     process.\n\n  Specifically with regard to Jose Padilla, Vice Admiral Jacoby also \nnoted in his Declaration that:\n\n       Providing [Padilla] access to counsel now would create \n     expectations by Padilla that his ultimate release may be \n     obtained through an adversarial civil litigation process. \n     This would break--probably irreparably--the sense of \n     dependency and trust that the interrogators are attempting to \n     create.\n\n  In remarks that I submitted for the Record when the original DTA was \nenacted, I described some of the valuable intelligence that the United \nStates has gained as a result of the interrogation of al-Qaida \ndetainees. The President made a similar case in a speech that he \ndelivered on September 6, but much better than I had done. I would like \nto simply quote at length, so that it is available in the Record, what \nthe President described--why it is important that our intelligence \nagents be able to conduct effective interrogations of al-Qaida members. \nOn the sixth of this month, the President stated:\n\n       Within months of September the 11th, 2001, we captured a \n     man known as Abu Zubaydah. We believe that Zubaydah was a \n     senior terrorist leader and a trusted associate of\n\n[[Page S10272]]\n\n     Osama bin Laden. Our intelligence community believes he had \n     run a terrorist camp in Afghanistan where some of the 9/11 \n     hijackers trained, and that he helped smuggle al Qaeda \n     leaders out of Afghanistan after coalition forces arrived to \n     liberate that country. Zubaydah was severely wounded during \n     the firefight that brought him into custody--and he survived \n     only because of the medical care arranged by the CIA.\n       After he recovered, Zubaydah was defiant and evasive. He \n     declared his hatred of America. During questioning, he at \n     first disclosed what he thought was nominal information--and \n     then stopped all cooperation. Well, in fact, the ``nominal'' \n     information he gave us turned out to be quite important. For \n     example, Zubaydah disclosed Khalid Sheikh Mohammed--or KSM--\n     was the mastermind behind the 9/11 attacks, and used the \n     alias ``Muktar.'' This was a vital piece of the puzzle that \n     helped our intelligence community pursue KSM. Abu Zubaydah \n     also provided information that helped stop a terrorist attack \n     being planned for inside the United States--an attack about \n     which we had no previous information. Zubaydah told us that \n     al Qaeda operatives were planning to launch an attack in the \n     U.S., and provided physical descriptions of the operatives \n     and information on their general location. Based on the \n     information he provided, the operatives were detained--one \n     while traveling to the United States.\n       We knew that Zubaydah had more information that could save \n     innocent lives, but he stopped talking. As his questioning \n     proceeded, it became clear that he had received training on \n     how to resist interrogation. And so the CIA used an \n     alternative set of procedures. These procedures were designed \n     to be safe, to comply with our laws, our Constitution, and \n     our treaty obligations. The Department of Justice reviewed \n     the authorized methods extensively and determined them to be \n     lawful. I cannot describe the specific methods used--I think \n     you understand why--if I did, it would help the terrorists \n     learn how to resist questioning, and to keep information from \n     us that we need to prevent new attacks on our country. But I \n     can say the procedures were tough, and they were safe, and \n     lawful, and necessary.\n       Zubaydah was questioned using these procedures, and soon he \n     began to provide information on key al Qaeda operatives, \n     including information that helped us find and capture more of \n     those responsible for the attacks on September the 11th. For \n     example, Zubaydah identified one of KSM's accomplices in the \n     9/11 attacks--a terrorist named Ramzi bin al Shibh. The \n     information Zubaydah provided helped lead to the capture \n     of bin al Shibh. And together these two terrorists \n     provided information that helped in the planning and \n     execution of the operation that captured Khalid Sheikh \n     Mohammed.\n       Once in our custody, KSM was questioned by the CIA using \n     these procedures, and he soon provided information that \n     helped us stop another planned attack on the United States. \n     During questioning, KSM told us about another al Qaeda \n     operative he knew was in CIA custody--a terrorist named Majid \n     Khan. KSM revealed that Khan had been told to deliver $50,000 \n     to individuals working for a suspected terrorist leader named \n     Hambali, the leader of al Qaeda's Southeast Asian affiliate \n     known as ``J-I''. CIA officers confronted Khan with this \n     information. Khan confirmed that the money had been delivered \n     to an operative named Zubair, and provided both a physical \n     description and contact number for this operative.\n       Based on that information, Zubair was captured in June of \n     2003, and he soon provided information that helped lead to \n     the capture of Hambali. After Hambali's arrest, KSM was \n     questioned again. He identified Hambali's brother as the \n     leader of a ``J-I'' cell, and Hambali's conduit for \n     communications with al Qaeda. Hambali's brother was soon \n     captured in Pakistan, and, in turn, led us to a cell of 17 \n     Southeast Asian ``J-I'' operatives. When confronted with the \n     news that his terror cell had been broken up, Hambali \n     admitted that the operatives were being groomed at KSM's \n     request for attacks inside the United States--probably [sic] \n     using airplanes.\n       During questioning, KSM also provided many details of other \n     plots to kill innocent Americans. For example, he described \n     the design of planned attacks on buildings inside the United \n     States, and how operatives were directed to carry them out. \n     He told us the operatives had been instructed to ensure that \n     the explosives went off at a point that was high enough to \n     prevent the people trapped above from escaping out the \n     windows.\n       KSM also provided vital information on al Qaeda's efforts \n     to obtain biological weapons. During questioning, KSM \n     admitted that he had met three individuals involved in al \n     Qaeda's efforts to produce anthrax, a deadly biological \n     agent--and he identified one of the individuals as a \n     terrorist named Yazid. KSM apparently believed we already had \n     this information, because Yazid had been captured and taken \n     into foreign custody before KSM's arrest. In fact, we did not \n     know about Yazid's role in al Qaeda's anthrax program. \n     Information from Yazid then helped lead to the capture of his \n     two principal assistants in the anthrax program. Without the \n     information provided by KSM and Yazid, we might not have \n     uncovered this al Qaeda biological weapons program, or \n     stopped this al Qaeda cell from developing anthrax for \n     attacks against the United States.\n       These are some of the plots that have been stopped because \n     of the information of this vital program. Terrorists held in \n     CIA custody have also provided information that helped stop a \n     planned strike on U.S. Marines at Camp Lemonier in Djibouti--\n     they were going to use an explosive laden water tanker. They \n     helped stop a planned attack on the U.S. consulate in Karachi \n     using car bombs and motorcycle bombs, and they helped stop a \n     plot to hijack passenger planes and fly them into Heathrow or \n     the Canary Wharf in London.\n       We're getting vital information necessary to do our jobs, \n     and that's to protect the American people and our allies.\n       Information from the terrorists in this program has helped \n     us to identify individuals that al Qaeda deemed suitable for \n     Western operations, many of whom we had never heard about \n     before. They include terrorists who were set to case targets \n     inside the United States, including financial buildings in \n     major cities on the East Coast. Information from terrorists \n     in CIA custody has played a role in the capture or \n     questioning of nearly every senior al Qaeda member or \n     associate detained by the U.S. and its allies since this \n     program began. By providing everything from initial leads to \n     photo identifications, to precise locations of where \n     terrorists were hiding, this program has helped us to take \n     potential mass murderers off the streets before they were \n     able to kill.\n       This program has also played a critical role in helping us \n     understand the enemy we face in this war. Terrorists in this \n     program have painted a picture of al Qaeda's structure and \n     financing, and communications and logistics. They identified \n     al Qaeda's travel routes and safe havens, and explained how \n     al Qaeda's senior leadership communicates with its operatives \n     in places like Iraq. They provided information that allows \n     us--that has allowed us to make sense of documents and \n     computer records that we have seized in terrorist raids. \n     They've identified voices in recordings of intercepted calls, \n     and helped us understand the meaning of potentially critical \n     terrorist communications.\n       The information we get from these detainees is corroborated \n     by intelligence, and we've received--that we've received from \n     other sources--and together this intelligence has helped us \n     connect the dots and stop attacks before they occur. \n     Information from the terrorists questioned in this program \n     helped unravel plots and terrorist cells in Europe and in \n     other places. It's helped our allies protect their people \n     from deadly enemies. This program has been, and remains, one \n     of the most vital tools in our war against the terrorists. It \n     is invaluable to America and to our allies. Were it not for \n     this program, our intelligence community believes that al \n     Qaeda and its allies would have succeeded in launching \n     another attack against the American homeland. By giving us \n     information about terrorist plans we could not get anywhere \n     else, this program has saved innocent lives.\n\n  I don't think that it can be seriously doubted that this intelligence \nwould not have been obtained if these men--Khalid Shaisk Muhammed and \nAbu Zubaydah--had been given the right to file a habeas petition and \naccess to a lawyer immediately after they were captured. And had we not \nobtained this information, lives of Americans and other innocent people \nwould have been lost.\n  The DTA and the MCA create a balanced and appropriate mechanism for \nmanaging the detention of alien enemy combatants. They are consistent \nwith military tradition and our Nation's security needs. The Specter \namendment would upend that system. I urge the Specter amendment's \ndefeat.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I only need one sentence to refute the \narguments of the Senator from Arizona, and it comes back to Justice \nO'Connor's opinion again. She says:\n\n       All agree that, absent suspension, the writ of habeas \n     corpus remains available to every individual--\n\n  Every individual--\n\n     detained within the United States.\n\n  Guantanamo is held to be within that concept. But she talks about \n``every individual.'' That includes citizens and noncitizens.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I congratulate the distinguished chairman \nof the Senate Judiciary Committee and my other colleagues who serve on \nthe Judiciary Committee--Senator Graham and Senator Kyl--for the \nquality of the discussion and debate. This is the kind of debate I came \nto the Senate and hoped to participate in.\n  I want to try to address the concerns raised by the distinguished \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee about this constitutional issue. I \nhappen to agree with what the Senator from Arizona said about the way \nthe U.S. Supreme Court has interpreted the rights of an\n\n[[Page S10273]]\n\nalien with regard to their constitutional rights.\n  The difference is, the Hamdi case the chairman was citing really had \nto do with whether Guantanamo Bay--leased property in Cuba--was within \nthe jurisdiction of the Court. It held because it was under a lease and \nunder the control of the United States that it was subject to the laws \npertaining to habeas corpus. But the way I read the case--and I believe \nthis is correct and consistent with the way the Senator from Arizona \ninterpreted it--it does not apply, they did not hold that it applied to \nan alien. But I want to say, even if he is right--and I disagree that \nhe is--that aliens, particularly unlawful combatants captured on the \nbattlefield, have all the rights an American citizen does under the \nConstitution, I believe his concerns are answered by the Swain case, \ndecided by the U.S. Supreme Court, which held that if, in fact, there \nis an adequate substitute remedy, that in fact that satisfies any \nconstitutional concerns with regard to the writ of habeas corpus.\n  I believe the Detainee Treatment Act, which we passed just last year, \nprovides an adequate substitute remedy sufficient to meet Supreme Court \nscrutiny. Even if the Supreme Court woke up and decided that all of a \nsudden it would overrule all of its old cases and hold that an unlawful \ncombatant, an alien--not a citizen of this country--was somehow \nentitled to the whole panoply of constitutional rights, that would \nsatisfy the Supreme Court's concerns about the process to which that \nalien was due.\n  But I also want to question sort of the logic of applying the \nConstitution to unlawful combatants captured on the battlefield. Are we \nsaying they are entitled to a fourth amendment right against \nunreasonable searches and seizures? Are we saying they have a fifth \namendment right not to incriminate themselves? Well, surely not. We \nhave all acknowledged the importance of being able to capture \nactionable intelligence through the interrogation process. And much of \nthe debate we have been having in these last few weeks has been: How do \nwe preserve this important intelligence-gathering tool which has \nallowed us to detect and disrupt terrorist attacks? How do we preserve \nthat and at the same time meet our other legal obligations, \nconstitutional and statutory?\n  I believe the Senator from South Carolina had a question. I would be \nhappy to yield to him for a question.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I appreciate that, and I am sorry to \ninterrupt. But I went back to the Hamdi decision that referenced the \nexchange we had with the chairman in reference to the point the Senator \njust made.\n  Justice O'Connor said:\n\n       Hamdi has received no process. An interrogation by one's \n     captor, however effective an intelligence-gathering tool, \n     hardly constitutes a constitutionally adequate factfinding \n     before a neutral decisionmaker.\n\n  When you turn to the next page, she says:\n\n       There remains the possibility that the standards we have \n     articulated could be met by an appropriately authorized and \n     properly constituted military tribunal. Indeed, it is notable \n     that military regulations already provide for such process in \n     related instances, dictating that tribunals be made available \n     to determine the status of enemy detainees who assert \n     prisoner-of-war status under the Geneva Convention.\n\n  She is referring to Army regulation 190-8. And my question to Senator \nCornyn is, do you agree that Justice O'Connor was telling the \nDepartment of Defense that if you will model a tribunal on Army \nregulation 190-8, you will have met your obligation to have a competent \ntribunal under the Geneva Conventions to make an enemy combatant status \ndetermination?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from South Carolina, \nI think that is certainly a reasonable construction of what the opinion \nsays.\n  Let me describe for our colleagues the kind of petitions for writ of \nhabeas corpus we are talking about that are being filed at Guantanamo \nBay.\n  A Canadian detainee who threw a grenade that killed an Army medic in \na firefight and who comes from a family with longstanding al-Qaida ties \nmoved for a preliminary injunction forbidding interrogation of him. \nThat is one example.\n  Another one is a Kuwaiti detainee who seeks a court order that they \nmust be provided dictionaries in contravention of the force protection \npolicy at Guantanamo Bay, and that their lawyer be given high-speed \nInternet access at their lodging on the base and be allowed to use \nclassified Department of Defense telecommunications facilities, all \nunder the theory that otherwise their ``right to counsel'' is unduly \nburdened.\n  Then there is the motion by a high-level al-Qaida detainee \ncomplaining about base security procedures, speed of mail delivery, and \nmedical treatment--even though they have abundant medical treatment and \nmedical facilities at Guantanamo Bay. They further seek an order that \nhe be transferred to the ``least onerous conditions'' at Guantanamo Bay \nand is asking the court to order that Guantanamo Bay authorities allow \nhim to keep any books and reading materials sent to him and to ``report \nto the court'' on his opportunities for exercise, communication, \nrecreation, and worship, among other things.\n  Then there is the ``emergency'' motion seeking a court order \nrequiring the authorities at Guantanamo Bay to set aside its normal \nsecurity practices and show detainees DVDs that are purported to be \nfamily videos.\n  Finally, I will mention, by way of absurd examples, the motion by \nKuwaiti detainees who are unsatisfied with the Koran they are provided \nas standard issue by the Guantanamo authorities, and they seek a court \norder that they be able to keep various other supplemental religious \nmaterial, such as a ``tafsir,'' or 4-volume Koran with commentary, in \ntheir cells.\n  To say there is ``no meaningful judicial review'' or adequate \nsubstitute remedy afforded unlawful combatants flies in the face of the \nfacts.\n  The Senator from South Carolina described the fact that these \ndetainees are, under current law, entitled to a combat status review \ntribunal, whose decision could then be appealed to the DC Circuit Court \nof Appeals to make sure the officials have actually provided the \nprocess to which these detainees are due, to make sure they have not \nbeen swept up in the fog of war and were innocent bystanders. This \nprovides a fair process for them and adequate judicial review.\n  We also have an annual administrative review board that determines, \non an annual basis, whether this remains a necessity to keep these \nindividuals in detention. I will point out that sometimes we are too \nlenient in terms of who we let go. I will cite to you a story of \nOctober 22, 2004, in the Washington Post, entitled ``Released Detainees \nRejoining the Fight.'' There are at least 10 detainees who were \nreleased from Guantanamo Bay that have been recaptured or killed while \nfighting U.S. or coalition forces after they were released.\n  The Supreme Court of the United States has talked about the \nimpracticality of providing enemy combatants of the U.S. the full \nprivilege of litigation. The Eisentrager court explained clearly and \neloquently why we don't let enemy combatants sue the U.S. military and \nour soldiers in our own Federal courts. This is what the court said:\n\n       Such trials would hamper the war effort and bring aid and \n     comfort to the enemy. . . . It would be difficult to devise a \n     more effective fettering of a field commander than to allow \n     the very enemies he is ordered to reduce to submission to \n     call him into account in his own civil courts and divert his \n     efforts and attention from the military offensive abroad to \n     the legal defensive at home. Nor is it unlikely that the \n     result of such enemy litigiousness would be a conflict \n     between judicial and military opinion highly comforting to \n     enemies of the United States.\n\n  Those burdens placed on our military by enemy combatant litigation \nagainst our military effort persist today, and we have it within our \npower to eliminate that burden, to allow our men and women in uniform \nto fight the fight they volunteered to do on our behalf, to keep us \nsafe and, at the same time, provide an adequate substitute remedy \nthrough the Detainee Treatment Act, as I have described a moment ago.\n  More than 200 cases have been filed on behalf of a purported 600 \ndetainees. Strangely, that exceeds the number of detainees who are \nactually at Guantanamo Bay. So we have lawsuits for people who don't \neven exist, apparently.\n  According to the Department of Justice:\n\n       This habeas litigation has consumed enormous resources and \n     disrupted the day-to-day operation at Guantanamo Naval Base.\n\n\n[[Page S10274]]\n\n\n  The United States of America, in a brief filed in the Al Odah case, \nsaid:\n\n       Perhaps most disturbing, the habeas litigation has \n     imperiled crucial military operations during a time of war. \n     In some cases, habeas counsel have violated protective orders \n     and jeopardized the security of the base by giving detainees \n     information likely to cause unrest. Moreover, habeas counsel \n     have frustrated interrogation critical to preventing further \n     terrorist attacks on the United States.\n\n  This seems to have been validated--these criticisms--by the U.S. in \nbriefs filed in Federal court by a lawyer who has filed those lawsuits \non behalf of enemy combatants held at Guantanamo Bay. He boasted about \ndisrupting U.S. war efforts in a magazine, where he said:\n\n       The litigation is brutal for [the United States.] It's \n     huge. We have over 100 lawyers now from big and small firms \n     working to represent detainees. Every time an attorney goes \n     down there, it makes it that much harder [for the United \n     States military] to do what they're doing. You can't run \n     an interrogation . . . with attorneys. What are they going \n     to do now that we're getting court orders to get more \n     lawyers down there?\n\n  I know time is precious and I want to yield back to the chairman of \nthe Armed Services Committee, but I believe those who argue for an \nextension of full habeas corpus rights, such as would be provided to an \nAmerican citizen in civilian courts, are making a fundamental mistake \nby confusing two different realms of constitutional law. One would \napply to an American citizen accused of a crime, where certainly the \ndesire and the order of business is to protect that individual against \nunjust charges, and to make sure that the full panoply of the Bill of \nRights applies to that individual. Different considerations apply when \nyou are talking about a declared enemy of the U.S., and particularly an \nunlawful combatant, someone who doesn't wear the uniform, someone who \ndoesn't respect the law of wars, and who targets innocent civilians in \nthe pursuit of their ideology.\n  I don't think we should make that mistake. So I reluctantly oppose \nthe amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I address the Senate on this issue and \npose a question to my distinguished colleague, the senior Senator from \nPennsylvania. I will put into the Record, following the conclusion of \nmy remarks and my colloquy with the Senator from Pennsylvania, \nadditional material.\n  Before I yield the floor, it is my desire to conclude the time on our \nside with the Senator from Missouri, and then reserve the remainder of \nmy time for tomorrow. It would be my hope that the Senator from \nPennsylvania, likewise, would save such remarks he may wish to make for \ntomorrow. As he knows, there is a function going on now, which I think \nmost of us are trying to attend.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, that is satisfactory to me. How much time \ndo I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 33 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, the amendment to give unlawful combatant \nhabeas corpus rights to mirror U.S. domestic procedures is unnecessary \nand inappropriate.\n  The amendment is unnecessary because the U.S. is already giving enemy \nunlawful combatants more rights to question their continued \nincarceration than they are entitled to under international law.\n  Under Geneva Conventions Article 5, combatants captured during \nwartime are due a hearing to determine their lawful status only if such \nstatus is in doubt.\n  The United States goes beyond this requirement to give every \ncombatant a status hearing, even when there is no doubt as to their \nstatus.\n  The U.S. gives combatants Combat Status Review Tribunal hearings, \nknown as CSRTs, to determine their status and review the need for their \ncontinued incarceration.\n  If this were not enough, there is a review process under the Detainee \nTreatment Act, passed last year, to which detainees are also subjected.\n  There is no need for further review processes for these enemy \ncombatant detainees. An enemy combatant detainee sounds a little \nsterile, but take a look at the name that is often referred to dealing \nwith this. The Supreme Court case which brought about the need for this \nlegislation deals with Hamdan. Let's be clear, Hamdan was Osama bin \nLaden's body guard and driver. This is the kind of person about whom we \nare talking. Giving unlawful enemy combatants such as these U.S. \ndomestic habeas rights is inappropriate. These people are not U.S. \ncitizens, arrested in the U.S. on some civil offense; they are, by \ndefinition, aliens engaged in or supporting terrorist hostilities \nagainst the U.S., and doing so in violation of the laws of the war.\n  Some may not have been around long enough to remember that the U.S. \ndetained hundreds of thousands of German and Japanese soldiers, \ncaptured on World War II battlefields. We didn't give these enemy \ncombatants access to U.S. domestic courts or habeas corpus rights. Not \nonly would that have been absurd, it would have totally bogged down the \nlegal system.\n  There has never been a legal question over the appropriateness of a \nseparate military process for enemy combatants. We should not now start \nadmitting them to the U.S. domestic legal process.\n  Current military review processes are more than adequate. Indeed, \nthey exceed international standards. Granting enemy combatants \nadditional U.S. domestic habeas corpus rights is unnecessary and \ninappropriate.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Virginia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, at this time, I observe no other Senators \ndesiring to address the subject with regard to the pending bill. Having \nsaid that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/27/senate-section/article/S10274-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10274-S10275]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, due to the passing of a close friend, I \nwas not present for the vote on amendment No. 5086, offered by Mr. \nLevin. With whis statement, I would like to inform the Senate that, had \nI been present, I would have voted against this amendment, which sought \nto strike the pending legislation on military commissions and insert \nthe text of the bill reported out of the Armed Services Committee.\n  Senators Warner, Graham and I wrote and supported the bill that was \nreported out of the Senate Armed Services Committee. Over the past 2 \nweeks, however, we have been involved in negotiations with the White \nHouse and the House of Representatives and reached a compromise.\n  The compromise legislation, which I support, does not redefine the \nGeneva Conventions in any way. It amends the War Crimes Act--which \ncurrently says only that a violation of Common Article 3 is a war \ncrime--by enumerating nine categories of offenses that constitute \n``grave breaches of Common Article 3'' and thus are war crimes, \npunishable by imprisonment or death.\n  The bill authorizes the President to interpret the Geneva \nConventions--a power he has already under the Constitution--as to what \nconstitute nongrave breaches. These interpretations must be published \nin the Federal Register, and they will have same force as other \nadministrative regulations, and thus may be trumped by law passed by \nCongress.\n  I am pleased with the agreement that we have reached with the \nadministration and I support this legislation in the form pending on \nthe floor. For this reason, if I had been present, I would have cast my \nvote against amendment No. 5086.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the timely \npassage of this legislation. In my view it is essential to the \nsuccessful prosecution of our war against the terrorists.\n\n[[Page S10275]]\n\n  Ever since the Supreme Court announced its decision in the case of \nHamdan v. Rumsfeld, I have made clear that my three primary goals for \nlegislation authorizing military tribunals were: (1) Adjudicating the \ncases of detained terrorists in proceedings that are consistent with \nour values of justice, (2) protecting classified information, and (3) \nensuring that our military and intelligence officers have clear \nstandards for what is, and is not, permissible during detention and \ninterrogation operations.\n  After discussing these issues with National Security Adviser Hadley \nand officials at the Department of Justice, I am comfortable in saying \nthat this legislation accomplishes each of those goals.\n  First, the legislation authorizes the President to establish military \ncommissions for the trial of unlawful enemy combatants. Enemy \ncombatants tried under this legal system will have the benefit of a \ncomprehensive process that assures them of legal representation, access \nto witnesses and evidence, the ability to present a defense, and the \nability to appeal any judgment to the Court of Military Commission \nReview, the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, and, ultimately, to the \nSupreme Court.\n  I dare say that some who may be tried by these military commissions \nwill receive more due process and legal protection than they were ever \nwilling to grant to others.\n  Second, while ensuring a full and fair process, the legislation also \nrecognizes the important role that classified information is likely to \nplay in these trials. The legislation expressly provides the government \nwith a privilege to protect classified information. At the same time, \nthe bill provides a number of ways for the trial court to ensure that \nthe defendant is sufficiently apprised of the evidence to be used \nagainst him. I think this bill strikes the right balance between \nproviding a full and fair process, and protecting classified \ninformation.\n  Third, and most important to me as chairman of the Intelligence \nCommittee, the bill provides military and intelligence officers \nconducting detention and interrogation operations with clear standards.\n  Why is this so important? Because, there is a consensus in the \nintelligence community that terrorist interrogations are the single \nbest source of actionable intelligence against the plots of a \ndetermined enemy.\n  Interrogation is a tool used by our brave men and women in the \nmilitary and intelligence community to combat a continuing terrorist \nthreat from those who are bent on attacking and killing Americans.\n  The majority of useable and actionable intelligence against al-Qaida \ncomes from terrorist interrogations and debriefings. This tool is vital \nto keeping Americans safe--it is irreplaceable and it must be \npreserved.\n  Of particular note is the CIA's detention and interrogation program, \nwhich has been a supremely valuable source of information. This program \nhas produced intelligence that has helped disrupt terrorist networks \nand prevent terrorist attacks. Furthermore, it has been carefully \nmonitored to ensure that it complies with all our laws.\n  But, the Supreme Court's decision in Hamdan applied the Geneva \nConvention's Common Article 3 to unlawful enemy combatants. This \nthreatened to shut down the CIA's detention and interrogation \noperations.\n  The standard articulated in Common Article 3 is extremely vague. This \nstandard leaves military and intelligence officers in the dark as to \nwhat is, and what is not, permitted in detaining and interrogating \nunlawful enemy combatants. Moreover, because under current law any \nviolation of Common Article 3 is a criminal violation, our \ninterrogators potentially could be subjected to criminal prosecution \nfor otherwise lawful actions.\n  Consequently, Congress must act to ensure that our military personnel \nand intelligence officers are not forced to operate, or be subjected to \nprosecution, under such a vague standard. It is our responsibility to \nprovide clear guidance to military personnel and intelligence officers \nas to what is, and is not, permitted in interrogations. The standard \nmust be clear enough so that our intelligence officers, who are making \njudgment calls in the field, can continue to operate.\n  The legislation currently before the Senate provides that clarity. It \nexpressly provides for what acts constitute grave breaches of Common \nArticle 3 and what acts would be subject to prosecution. It further \nallows the President to promulgate regulations for lesser violations of \ntreaty obligations.\n  As a result, in passing this legislation, we will give the dedicated \nand honorable Americans on the front lines in the war on terror the \nclarity they need to fulfill their mission.\n  To win this war and keep Americans safe, our troops in the field and \nour law enforcement personnel here at home need timely and actionable \nintelligence. We get that intelligence in many forms such as satellite \nimagery, intercepted communications, financial tracking and human \nintelligence, including interrogations. In the past months, many of \nthese intelligence collection tools have been damaged by deliberate \nleaks of classified information.\n  We can ill afford to lose any of these intelligence collection tools \nif we are to succeed. I am grateful that this bill will allow our \nNation to continue its highly valuable interrogation programs.\n  I support the bill, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we have had a very good debate. We have \nvoted on one amendment. We have time remaining on the Specter \namendment. We should be able to conclude that debate in the morning and \nproceed, I presume, to a prompt vote on the Specter amendment, and then \nproceed with the other two amendments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/27/senate-section/article/S10275-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10275]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, I rise to speak about the use of ultrasound \nimaging by emergency physicians. October 2006 marks the 10-year \nanniversary of the establishment of the American College of Emergency \nPhysicians, ACEP, Section of Emergency Ultrasound, which actively \nencourages research and training of emergency physicians in the use of \nemergency ultrasound. October 15, 2006, celebrates Emergency Ultrasound \nDay.\n  As a trauma surgeon, I spent many days and nights serving the \nemergency department. Emergency ultrasound, defined as the use of \nultrasound imaging at the patient's bedside, is a critical component of \nquality emergency medical care. Ultrasound imaging enhances the \nphysician's ability to evaluate, diagnose, and treat patients in the \nemergency department. It provides immediate information and can answer \nspecific questions about the patient's physical condition, such as \ndetermining whether a presenting patient has thoracic and abdominal \ntraumas, ectopic pregnancy, pericardial effusion, and many other \nconditions.\n  High-quality emergency care is dependent on rapid diagnostic tools, \nenhanced safety of emergency procedures, and reduced treatment time. \nImaging technology has greatly improved quality of care and made \ninvasive medical procedures safer.\n  Emergency physicians are trained in the use of imaging equipment \nduring their residency as well as continuing medical education courses. \nHospital privileges further validate this training.\n  Emergency ultrasound has moved outside the hospital due to its \ncompact nature. In fact, emergency ultrasound technology is helpful \nonsite during military and disaster medical care. It has served in the \ncare of America's brave military troops during both the gulf and Iraq \nwars. Also, emergency ultrasound was used to care for patients last \nyear after Hurricane Katrina and will be helpful in responding to other \ndisasters and mass casualty events.\n  Mr. President, I congratulate the work of the ACEP Section of \nEmergency Ultrasound. It has increased awareness of the contribution \nand value of emergency ultrasound by emergency physicians in the \nmedical\n\n[[Page S10276]]\n\ncare of emergency patients, survivors of disasters, and our military \nforces serving at home and abroad. Research in this field should \ncontinue to be encouraged to allow the adaptation of critical \ntechnologies to continually improve the quality of emergency care.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/27/senate-section/article/S10276-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10276]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 BURMA\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I wish to mark an important milestone: \nthe 18th anniversary of the founding of the Burmese National League for \nDemocracy, NLD. As the world knows well, the NLD is the legitimate \nleadership of the country of Burma, as the party was elected \noverwhelmingly by the Burmese people in 1990.\n  Sadly, the 18th anniversary for the NLD is not a time for rejoicing. \nThe NLD remains firmly under the boot of the Burmese ruling junta, the \nState Peace and Development Council, SPDC. Many of its leaders are \nimprisoned, including Nobel Laureate and democracy advocate Daw Aung \nSan Suu Kyi, and NLD vice chairman, U Tin Oo. Thirteen elected NLD \nmembers of Parliament and over 400 party members currently serve in \nprison. Other NLD members have endured torture and have been killed as \nthe SPDC continues to wage a campaign of harassment, intimidation--and \nworse--against party members and supporters.\n  In a testament to the courage and determination of its leadership, \nand despite these great hardships, the NLD remains unbowed. It \ncontinues to pursue nonviolent political change in Burma. I am proud to \nsay that the Senate stands squarely alongside the NLD in its efforts. I \nam hopeful that the United Nations, U.N., Security Council will as \nwell. Due to the determined efforts of many countries, including the \nUnited States, Burma is slated to be on the Council's agenda for the \nfirst time ever. It will then be time for member states to stand up and \nbe counted in support of a nonpunitive resolution on Burma.\n  It should be noted that U.N. Under Secretary General Ibrahim \nGambari's trip to Rangoon earlier this year was a complete failure. Mr. \nGambari should not make a second trip to Burma unless and until the \nU.N. Security Council has considered and passed a resolution that, \namong other things, details the threats the SPDC poses to the people of \nBurma and the entire region. Such action would be a clear message to \nthe SPDC that when it comes to Burma, the world is not satisfied with \nthe status quo.\n  Similarly, I would encourage all relevant bureaus at the State \nDepartment and the National Security Council--particularly those \nrelating to African affairs--to remain engaged and focused on this \nissue. The task of promoting democracy and reconciliation in Burma \nshould not be left only to the East Asian and Pacific Affairs and the \nDemocracy, Human Rights, and Labor bureaus at the State Department. \nWith three African nations currently sitting on the U.N. Security \nCouncil, our African affairs specialists need to more actively engage \nin building support for such a resolution. Ghana has already \ndemonstrated its solidarity with the cause of freedom. The Republic of \nCongo and Tanzania need to follow suit.\n  Finally, on this, the 18th anniversary of the founding of NLD, I call \nupon the Burmese military regime to release Suu Kyi and all political \nprisoners. Only then can discussions on a meaningful reconciliation \nprocess--one that includes the full and unfettered participation of the \nNLD and ethnic minorities--proceed.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a Boston Globe Editorial on Burma be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Boston Globe, Sept. 26, 2006]\n\n                          An Agenda for Burma\n\n       Having placed the case of Burma's military junta on the \n     formal agenda of the Security Council earlier this month, the \n     United Nations now has an opportunity to show that it can be \n     something more than an impatient debating club. If in the \n     waning days of his tenure UN Secretary General Kofi Annan \n     exercises the right combination of firmness and finesse with \n     Burma's military dictators, he can help protect human rights, \n     democracy, and regional security in Asia.\n       Unlike the coercive measures contemplated to cope with \n     Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons or genocide in Darfur, the \n     UN is not being asked to dispatch armed peacekeepers to Burma \n     to impose risky economic sanctions on the narco-dictatorship \n     there. Rather, moral suasian and diplomatic pressure are the \n     means for dealing with the junta's violations of human rights \n     and its threats to regional peace and security--threats \n     manifest in the export of heroin, methamphetamine, HIV/AIDS, \n     and the hundreds of thousands of refugees who have fled the \n     military's brutal assaults on ethnic minorities.\n       Annan must be careful, however, in the way he exerts the \n     UN's soft power. Last May, he sent UN undersecretary-general \n     for political affairs, Ibrahim Gambari, to Burma, where he \n     met with Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi as well as \n     junta leaders. At the time, Gambari said he thought the junta \n     bosses were ``ready to turn a new page.'' But Gambari and \n     Annan looked gullible soon after, when the junta extended Suu \n     Kyi's house arrest for another year and intensified its \n     campaign of ethnic cleansing, rape, and murder in the region \n     inhabited by 2 million people of the Karen ethnic group.\n       Annan shouldn't allow Gambari to undertake a return trip to \n     Burma without a Security Council resolution that spells out \n     clear and reasonable demands for the true turning of a new \n     page. That should include the release of all 1,100 political \n     prisoners in Burma, including Suu Kyi and fellow leaders of \n     the National League for Democracy, the party that won 82 \n     percent of Parliamentary seats in a 1990 election that the \n     junta has refused to honor ever since.\n       The NLD, which commemorates the anniversary of its 1988 \n     founding on Sept. 27, must be invited along with other \n     parties and representatives of Burma's ethnic nationalities \n     to participate in a genuine political dialogue. The \n     resolution Gambari takes to Burma should specify that such a \n     dialogue means working out terms for an agreement on a return \n     to democracy. That resolution should also require the junta \n     to end its attacks on ethnic minorities and to permit \n     international aid organizations to have unimpeded access to \n     all those in need within Burma. Nearly all the people of \n     Burma need the world's help.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/27/senate-section/article/S10276-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10276-S10277]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RECOGNIZING SERGEANT LEIGH ANN HESTER\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask the entire Senate to join me \ntoday in congratulating one of Kentucky's amazing young heroes. SGT \nLeigh Ann Hester of Bowling Green, KY, is traveling to the Nation's \nCapital to receive the USO's Service Member of the Year Award at the \norganization's 2006 USO World Gala this September 28.\n  Sergeant Hester is being honored for her valorous service in combat \nin Iraq, which earned her the Silver Star medal. The Silver Star is the \nArmy's third-highest award for gallantry, and Sergeant Hester is the \nfirst female soldier to win the medal for valor in combat since World \nWar II.\n  A retail store manager in Bowling Green, Sergeant Hester joined the \nU.S. Army in 2001 and was assigned to the Kentucky National Guard's \n617th Military Police Company, based in Richmond, KY. In March 2005, \nshe was on the southeastern outskirts of Baghdad, shadowing a convoy of \ntractor-trailers carrying supplies for American forces.\n  The convoy was ambushed by about 50 heavily armed terrorists. They \nattacked from a trench alongside the road and rained down machine-gun \nfire and rocket-propelled grenades on the convoy for a sustained 3 \nminutes. Several truck drivers were killed, more were wounded. Thinking \nthey had the upper hand, the terrorists moved towards the convoy, \npreparing to take hostages.\n  Suddenly three armored humvees roared up to the carnage. Sergeant \nHester, as team leader of the second humvee, maneuvered her team into a \nposition to draw the enemy's fire and begin fighting back with grenades \nand M203 rounds.\n  Sergeant Hester and her squad leader got out of their humvees and \nrushed the trench about 20 meters away from them to clear out the \nenemy. They worked their way through the insurgents, throwing grenades \nand firing M4s. When she ran low on ammunition, she ran back to a \nhumvee to reload, exposing herself to enemy fire from multiple \ndirections. Because this squad had been so well disciplined, Sergeant \nHester was able to reach blindly into any of the humvees and know \nexactly where to grab more ammunition.\n  Finally, the soldiers of the 617th had put down enough fire that the \nenemy fell silent. It turns out that Sergeant Hester and her team, just \n10 in all, had not only put themselves in the middle of a firefight \nagainst greater numbers and all survived, they had scored the highest \ndeath toll of insurgents in Iraq in many months. They killed 27, \ncaptured several wounded, seized a sizable\n\n[[Page S10277]]\n\nweapons cache, and secured valuable intelligence.\n  Sergeant Hester's actions were cited as having ``saved the lives of \nnumerous convoy members.'' For her bravery, she was awarded the Silver \nStar medal on June 16, 2006.\n  Sergeant Hester's courage, dedication, and sacrifice on behalf of her \ncountry and her fellow soldiers make her a hero and a role model that \nevery young Kentuckian can emulate. I am proud that a woman of such \ncharacter and determination hails from the Bluegrass State, and I know \nthe entire Senate joins me in thanking her for her service in defense \nof America and America's ideals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/27/senate-section/article/S10277-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10277]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                 Sergeant First Class Richard J. Henkes\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, it is my honor to pay tribute to the \nlife of SFC Richard J. Henkes, a brave soldier who gave his life in \nsupport of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Sergeant Henkes will be remembered \nas a courageous soul, a proud father, and an inspiration to those who \nknew him best. The 200 people who gathered at his memorial service are \na testament to the number of lives he touched. They are lives that he \ncontinues to touch through the legacy he leaves behind.\n  Sergeant Henkes wrestled and ran track in high school, but his true \npassion was snowboarding. He shared this passion with his 6-year-old \ndaughter, Isabel, as well as with his 17-year-old niece, Cassidy, who \nfondly remembers the caring uncle who was always there to pick her up \nwhen she would fall. Above all, Sregeant Henkes was a compassionate, \noutgoing, and fun-loving guy with a great sense of humor. It was this \ncompassion for others and desire to make a difference that drove him to \ncarry on his family's rich history of military service, dating back to \nWorld War I.\n  Stationed out of Fort Lewis, WA, Sergeant Henkes served with C \nCompany, 2nd Battalion, 3rd Infantry Regiment, 2nd Infantry Division. \nIn Iraq, he was recently placed in command of his platoon--a challenge \nthat he embraced. Tragically, Sergeant Henkes died on September 3 from \ninjuries sustained from a roadside bomb in Mosul, Iraq. People say he \nknew of the dangers of war, but he believed his mission would make a \ndifference in the lives of countless people and that it was worth the \nsacrifice. Mourners paid tribute to Sergeant Henkes in the Woodburn, \nOR, National Guard Armory on September 11. At the ceremony, he was \nposthumously awarded the Bronze Star and Purple Heart service medals by \nhis battalion.\n  We grieve the loss of another soldier who made the ultimate sacrifice \nto defend the freedoms we all cherish. Sergeant Henkes leaves behind a \nlegacy that will live on through the people he inspired and the young \ndaughter who will grow up knowing that her father lived to make a \ndifference in the world. My thoughts and prayers are with his daughter \nIsabel, his parents, Chris and Jim Stanton of Ashdown, AR, and Richard \nand Karen Henkes of Woodburn, OR, and to all those who knew and loved \nhim.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 3549, the \nForeign Investment and National Security Act. S. 3549 reforms the \nCommittee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which is more \ncommonly known as CFIUS. CFIUS is the entity of our Federal Government \ncharged with reviewing any type of foreign investment in the United \nStates, and reviews all corporate transactions involving foreign-owned \ncompanies. Its top priority has always been to protect America's \nnational security interests, and that must remain its main focus. \nHowever, this foremost concern can and must be addressed without \njeopardizing foreign investment in our country--a critical economic \nengine.\n  This CFIUS reform bill represents an effort by the Senate to ensure \nthat the national security interests of the United States are protected \nin the context of foreign investment in U.S. industries. As a member of \nthe Banking Committee, I supported this effort as a necessary way to \nrestore the confidence of the American people in the CFIUS process, and \nI commend Chairman Shelby and Ranking Member Sarbanes and my colleagues \non the committee for their work to date on this legislation. Though I \nsupported Senate passage of the bill in an effort to keep this \nimportant legislation moving through the legislative process, I want to \nhighlight two provisions in the bill with which I have significant \nconcerns because they will have a chilling effect on foreign \ninvestment.\n  First, the provision that potentially extends the initial 30-day \nreview period to a 60-day period would place all foreign investors, \nincluding those of our closest allies, at a competitive disadvantage. \nUnder current law, most transactions, foreign and domestic, require an \nantitrust review under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act which takes a minimum \nof thirty days. However, the foreign investor is also, appropriately, \nrequired to undergo a 30-day CFIUS review, which may occur concurrently \nwith the HSR review. This process allows a thorough review without \nputting one type of investor at a disadvantage to another. S. 3549, \nhowever, would potentially expand the 30-day CFIUS review to 60 days, \ncreating a much longer delay and one that is disconnected from the HSR-\nmandated time table. This would create a substantial competitive \ndisadvantage. Our government ought to be able to quickly identify and \nclarify the national security implications of a given transaction \ncertainly within the 30 days prescribed under current law.\n  The second provision with which I have concern would require repeated \nand detailed notifications about ongoing transactions to many Members \nof Congress and State Governors. Such notifications would only \npoliticize transactions, do little to resolve national security \nconcerns and undermine the CFIUS process.\n  This bill makes a strong attempt to strike the appropriate balance \nbetween national security, sound economic policy, and appropriate \noversight. The two provisions I have highlighted upset this balance, \nbut because I support this overall effort, I look forward to continued \ncollaboration with Senators Shelby and Sarbanes and the other members \nof the Banking Committee as we address these issues in conference with \nthe House.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/27/senate-section/article/S10277-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10277-S10278]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 NOMINATION OF FRANCISCO AUGUSTO BESOSA\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would have voted in support of the \nnomination of Francisco Augusto Besosa to the U.S. District Court for \nthe District of Puerto Rico. However, I was on my way back from Montana \nand was unable to make it to the Senate floor before the vote ended.\n  Mr. Besosa is well qualified for the position and will be a good \naddition to the court.\n  Francisco Augusto ``Frank'' Besosa is partner and head of the \nlitigation department of Adsuar Muniz Goyco Besosa, P.S.C. in San Juan, \nPuerto Rico. After graduating from Brown University in 1971, he served \n5 years in active military service in military intelligence. He was \nhonorably discharged from Inactive Reserve from the U.S. Army with the \nrank of captain in 1977. He earned a J.D. from Georgetown University \nLaw Center in 1979. After law school, Mr. Besosa returned to Puerto \nRico and joined the law firm of O'Neill & Borges.\n  With the exception of 3 years in the 1980s as an assistant U.S. \nattorney, Mr. Besosa has spent his entire legal career in private \npractice in several firms conducting civil and commercial litigation in \nPuerto Rico. His work has focused on banking and bankruptcy; securities \nregulation; admiralty; insurance; torts including personal injury, \nmedical malpractice, and product liability; telecommunications and \nintellectual property both at the trial and appellate level.\n  Mr. Besosa is a member of numerous bars including the Puerto Rico Bar \nAssociation, the Federal Bar Association, American Bar Association, \nDistrict of Columbia Bar Association, U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nFirst Circuit and the Federal Circuit, and the Hispanic National Bar \nAssociation. He has held a variety of leadership positions in the \nFederal Bar Association Puerto Rico Chapter including director, \npresident-elect, vice president, secretary and treasurer.\n  The ABA has recommended Mr. Besosa for the position with a unanimous \n``well qualified'' rating.\n  Given his qualifications and experience, Mr. Besosa is a good fit for \nthe\n\n[[Page S10278]]\n\nU.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico. I would have \nsupported his nomination.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the Secure Fence \nAct of 2006 and the issue of securing our northern border. Without \nquestion, securing the border is our most vital need in dealing with \nillegal immigrants and as it stands, our borders lay vulnerable to not \nonly an influx of illegal immigrants but also transportation of \ndangerous materials. The facts are clear--each year over 1 million \nunauthorized aliens are interdicted entering the country mostly on the \nsouthwest border. Testimony by the Border Patrol union chief places the \nestimate of illegal entrants not interdicted by Border Patrol to be two \ntimes those actually caught. Simply put, the Border Patrol is \noverwhelmed by the sheer volume of the traffic and it is time to take \naction.\n  The Secure Fence Act of 2006 requires the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity to take all appropriate actions to achieve operational control \nover all U.S. international land and maritime borders within 18 months \nof its enactment. Additionally, the bill authorizes 700 miles of \ndouble-layered fencing at specified locations along the almost 2,000-\nmile southwest U.S. international border with Mexico.\n  This bill also takes the right approach in terms of northern border \nsecurity. The legislation requires the Department of Homeland Security \nto conduct a study on the feasibility of a state of-the-art \ninfrastructure security system along the northern international land \nand maritime border of the United States. The study shall include the \nnecessity of implementing such a system, the feasibility of \nimplementing such a system and the economic impact implementing such a \nsystem will have along the northern border.\n  In my home state of Minnesota, we share 547 miles of border with \nCanada and 458 of those miles are a water boundary. I want to make it \nclear to my constituents and our Canadian friends that this legislation \nshould not be used to justify construction of a wall along the northern \nborder but to take an inventory of the systems that are working and not \nworking and ensure that we put in place the most effective approach. We \nare going to measure twice before building once.\n  The United States and Canada share a long history of working together \non issues of mutual concern. Both countries share a common border and \ncommon objectives: to ensure that the border is open for business, but \nclosed to crime. The Canada-United States Smart Border Declaration and \nAction Plan and programs such as the Security and Prosperity \nPartnership and the Integrated Border Enforcement Teams are great \nexamples of cooperative initiatives that have proven successful.\n  I am fully confident this strong relationship and commitment to \nborder security will continue as it is one of the cornerstones to \nsecuring our northern border.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/27/senate-section/article/S10278-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10278]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NATIONAL EMPLOY OLDER WORKERS WEEK\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize National Employ \nOlder Workers Week, a time to celebrate the many older workers who are \nredefining retirement and the employers that welcome their talents.\n  Many older Americans do not see retirement as just a period of \nleisure; they continue to contribute to our nation's businesses, \ncommunities, and economy. And some employers, facing a shortage of \nskilled and experienced workers, have recognized the value of older \nworkers by changing their policies to attract and retain them.\n  One of those employers is Mercy Health System, which is based in \nWisconsin and has 63 health care facilities across Wisconsin and \nIllinois. AARP recently ranked Mercy Health System the top employer for \nolder workers in the country. Mercy Health System attracts and retains \nolder workers by providing flexible work options, like its Work-to-\nRetire Program, which offers reduced and seasonal work schedules while \nmaintaining health benefits.\n  Yet too few employers have followed Mercy Health System's lead in \ncreating better work options for older Americans. While most older \nworkers want to work past traditional retirement age, many do not want \nto work a traditional full-time schedule. Today, only about one-third \nof older workers have flexible work schedules. Even when employers \noffer flexible work options like part-time work schedules, most do not \nalso offer benefits: only 22 percent of part-time workers have access \nto health benefits.\n  So while older workers and some employers have begun to reinvent \nretirement, we have a long way to go. That is why I authored the Older \nWorker Opportunity Act, which aims to expand opportunities for older \nAmericans to work longer if they so choose. The centerpiece of this \nlegislation is a tax credit for employers that offer flexible, reduced, \nor seasonal work schedules to older workers while maintaining their \nhealth and pension benefits. Such a credit would reward employers like \nMercy Health System who are doing the right thing, while encouraging \nother employers to follow their lead. Greater workplace flexibility \nwould not only benefit older Americans, but would also reduce employer \ncosts by increasing productivity and job retention.\n  Just this week, the National Committee to Preserve Social Security \nand Medicare endorsed the Older Worker Opportunity Act. In its letter \nof support, president and CEO Barbara Kennelly offered that the bill \n``could help pave the way for significant increases in older worker \nemployment.'' I agree, and I am proud to have them join our other \nsupporters, including the National Council on Aging, the National Older \nWorker Career Center, Watson Wyatt Worldwide, the Committee for \nEconomic Development, the Association of Jewish Family and Children's \nAgencies, and United Jewish Communities. With their backing, this bill \nwill continue to gain steam.\n  During National Employ Older Workers Week, we also celebrate the \nSenior Community Service Employment Program--SCSEP--which has provided \ncommunity service and job training to low-income seniors for 40 years. \nAs our baby boomers age and seniors become a growing share of the \npopulation, we must strengthen SCSEP so that all eligible seniors get \nthe help they need. Many of us were concerned when the Administration \nproposed a major overhaul of this program, which would have been \ndisruptive to both grantees and participants. I am hopeful that the \nOlder Americans Act reauthorization bill will preserve the basic \nstructure of the program and build on its success.\n  I urge Congress to pass the OAA reauthorization as soon as possible \nso that seniors in need of SCSEP services have the tools to stay active \nin the workforce and their communities. But beyond reauthorization, we \nmust also boost SCSEP's funding, which is currently only enough to \nserve less than one percent of the eligible population. As a member of \nthe Appropriations Committee, I will continue to press for additional \nfunding so that all older Americans who want or need to work longer \nhave the opportunity to do so.\n  As older Americans live longer and healthier lives, most have the \nability and desire to remain active. Some want to maintain physical and \nmental health, some need to improve their financial security, and some \nwant to continue to contribute to society. Whatever the reason, it's \ntime to change the way we think about retirement. Older Americans are a \nvaluable asset to our nation's businesses, communities, and economy, \nand we must tap their reservoir of experience and talents. Our seniors \ndeserve it, and our economic future may well depend on it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/27/senate-section/article/S10278-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10278-S10281]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES IMPROVEMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, yesterday, the House of Representatives \npassed the Senate amendment to S. 3525, which represents the bipartisan \nand bicameral agreement on the Child and Family Services Improvement \nAct of 2006.\n  I was pleased to have introduced the Senate amendment with my friend \nand partner on the Senate Finance Committee, Senator Max Baucus. \nSenator Baucus and I were joined by Senator Orrin G. Hatch, and Senator \nJohn D. Rockefeller, Jr. and Senator Olympia J. Snowe. All of these \nmembers have a long history of support for important programs to \nimprove the well-being of children.\n\n[[Page S10279]]\n\n  This important legislation reauthorizes the Promoting Safe and Stable \nFamilies Program which provides services to families for family \nsupport, family preservation, time-limited reunification of families, \nand for adoption and post-adoption services. These are critical funding \nstreams, and the reauthorization of the Promoting Safe and Stable \nFamilies Program ensures that families can rely on these preventative \nand supportive services.\n  The legislation also aligns the Child Welfare Services Act with the \nprevention activities of the Promoting Safe and Stable Families Program \nby providing incentives to States to invest in prevention services \nwhile allowing States to continue current State spending on existing \nState priorities.\n  S. 3525 provides support for increased caseworker visits as well as \nadopts a version of President Bush's proposal to provide a voucher for \nmentoring services for children of prisoners.\n  Additionally, the legislation increases access for funding for Indian \ntribes, which was a key priority of both Senator Baucus and Senator \nKent Conrad.\n  The legislation that will soon be signed by the President also \nincludes grants for regional partnerships to address the growing \nproblem of methamphetamine and other substance abuse and addictions \nthat have had a substantial impact on child welfare systems and \nservices.\n  Funding for these competitive grants was a key priority of mine, and \nI am pleased that the compromise we were able to work out with the \nHouse maintains the support for grants to improve the outcomes for \nchildren affected by methamphetamine abuse and addiction.\n  Mr. President, the Senate Finance Committee did a great deal of work \non issues relating to child welfare. We held the first full committee \nhearing in 10 years on child welfare, and we held an additional hearing \non the effects of the methamphetamine epidemic on the child welfare \nsystem. We worked on a bipartisan basis to mark up and pass the \nImproving Outcomes for Children Affected by Meth Act of 2005. Key \nprovisions of that bill are features in the legislation which will soon \nbe signed into law.\n  But there is more that can be done to strengthen and improve child \nwelfare services. I intend to continue to work on a bipartisan basis to \ndevelop and enact reforms to ensure that all children have access to \nloving, permanent homes.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to thank the staff who worked \ntirelessly to get this bill done. Members of Congress in both the House \nand the Senate are very well served by our staffs. These men and women \ncare a great deal about these programs, and we are indebted to them for \ntheir insights and analysis.\n  I am grateful to the talented staff from the office of Senator \nBaucus, specifically, Diedra Henry-Spires, Doug Steiger, and Michelle \nEaston. Additionally, I am grateful to Senator Rockefeller's extremely \nknowledgeable aid Barbara Pryor.\n  I appreciate the work of the staff on the Subcommittee on Human \nResources of the House Committee on Ways and Means, Matt Weidinger and \nChristine Calpin for the majority and Nick Gwyn and Sonja Nesbit for \nthe minority.\n  I also thank the dedicated analyst from the Congressional Research \nService, Emilie Stoltzfus who provided staff with invaluable expertise \non child welfare programs.\n  Thanks to Christina Hawley Anthony from the Congressional Budget \nOffice as well as legislative counsels Ruth Ernst and James Grossman.\n  Finally, I appreciate the efforts of my own Finance Committee policy \nlead on this issue, Becky Shipp as well as Mark Hayes, Ted Totman, and \nKolan Davis.\n  Mr. President, because a formal conference was not convened on this \nbill, there is no conference report filed. However, the staff has \nprepared a section-by-section analysis of the Senate-House agreement \nfor purposes of the legislative history.\n  Mr. President, some will say this has been a ``do nothing congress.'' \nI couldn't disagree more, and I believe that the children and families \nserved by this legislation would disagree as well.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the section-by-section \nanalysis to which I referred be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n\n  S. 3525, THE CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2006, AS \n                                AMENDED\n\n (Prepared by the Staff of the U.S. House Committee on Ways and Means \n     and the U.S. Senate Committee on Finance, September 27, 2006)\n\n     Section 1--Short Title\n       ``The Child and Family Services Improvement Act of 2006''\n     Section 2--Findings\n       The legislation makes a number of findings regarding the \n     provision of services under two child welfare programs \n     authorized under Title IV-B of the Social Security Act, the \n     Child Welfare Services (CWS) program and the Promoting Safe \n     and Stable Families (PSSF) program. The findings note the \n     importance of monthly caseworker visits in improving outcomes \n     for children. They also outline the relationship between the \n     entry of children into the child welfare system and their \n     parent's abuse of methamphetamine and other substances.\n     Section 3--Reauthorization of the Promoting Safe and Stable \n         Families Program\n     Current Law\n       For fiscal year (FY) 2006, authorizes mandatory funding of \n     $345 million for the Promoting Safe and Stable Families \n     (PSSF) program (Title IV-B, Subpart 2 of the Social Security \n     Act) and discretionary funding of $200 million for each of \n     FYs 2002 through 2006.\n     S. 3525\n       The legislation extends the mandatory PSSF funding \n     authorization of $345 million for five years (FYs 2007 \n     through 2011) and extends the discretionary funding \n     authorization of $200 million for each of those same five \n     years. The legislation expands the reporting requirement to \n     include both proposed spending and actual spending under the \n     CWS and PSSF programs, and at State option, other programs \n     that support child abuse prevention activities and child \n     welfare services. The legislation also prohibits HHS from \n     making any payment of PSSF funds to a State for \n     administrative costs that exceed 10 percent of total program \n     expenditures (Federal and non-Federal) of a State.\n     Reason for Change\n       The PSSF program supports four categories of services \n     provided to children and families: family preservation \n     services, community-based family support services, time-\n     limited reunification services, and adoption promotion and \n     support services. The legislation recognizes the importance \n     of encouraging States to invest in these activities. Thus the \n     legislation provides for the $200 million increase in \n     mandatory PSSF funds over the next five years included in the \n     Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (Pub. L. 109-171). In total \n     $345 million in mandatory funds (the recent $305 million \n     allotment of annual mandatory funds, plus a $40 million \n     annual increase provided under the Deficit Reduction Act of \n     2005) will be provided in each of FYs 2007 through 2011.\n       The legislation also will ensure better oversight and \n     accountability of spending under the CWS and PSSF programs by \n     requiring States to report on projected and actual spending \n     under these two programs. Specifically, data on actual \n     spending will help track State investments for the four \n     priorities of the PSSF program.\n     Section 4--Targeting of Promoting Safe and Stable Families \n         Program Resources\n     Current Law\n       Current law requires States to include assurances in their \n     PSSF plan that they will spend significant portions of their \n     PSSF funds in each of four priority areas: (1) family \n     preservation services; (2) community-based family support \n     services; (3) time-limited family reunification services; and \n     (4) adoption promotion and support services.\n     S. 3525\n       The legislation retains the four priorities of PSSF while \n     targeting the additional $40 million per year provided under \n     the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (Pub. L. 109-171) to two \n     new priorities: (1) support for monthly caseworker visits; \n     and (2) competitive grants to promote the well-being of \n     children in or at risk of placement in the child welfare \n     system as a result of their parent's abuse of methamphetamine \n     or other substances.\n       The legislation provides a total of $95 million to States \n     to support monthly caseworker visits of children in foster \n     care under the responsibility of the State, with a primary \n     emphasis on activities designed to improve caseworker \n     retention, recruitment, training, and ability to access the \n     benefits of technology. States will receive $40 million from \n     FY 2006 PSSF funds (with these funds available through FY \n     2009), $5 million in FY 2008, $10 million in FY 2009, and $20 \n     million in each of FYs 2010 and 2011 to support monthly \n     caseworker visits. States cannot use these funds to supplant \n     any Federal funds already paid to the State under the Title \n     IV-E program that could be used for the purposes outlined \n     above.\n       To promote the well-being of children affected by their \n     parent's abuse of methamphetamine or other substances, the \n     legislation provides a total of $145 million to the Secretary \n     of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to award \n     competitive\n\n[[Page S10280]]\n\n     grants to regional partnerships to pursue innovative \n     approaches to help children and families. Funding will be $40 \n     million in FY 2007, $35 million in FY 2008, $30 million, in \n     FY 2009 and $20 million in each of FYs 2010 and 2011. \n     Partnerships must include the State child welfare agency or \n     an Indian tribe and at least one other eligible partner, \n     including: child welfare service providers (non-profit and \n     for-profit), community providers of health or mental \n     health services, local law enforcement agencies, judges \n     and court personnel, juvenile justice officials, school \n     personnel, the State agency responsible for administering \n     the substance abuse prevention and treatment block grant \n     (authorized under Title XIX-B, Subpart II of the Public \n     Health Services Act), and any other providers, agencies, \n     personnel, officials or entities related to the provision \n     of child and family services. Grants of between $500,000 \n     and $1 million per year will be awarded for 2 to 5 year \n     periods.\n       A priority will be given to grant applications that propose \n     to combat methamphetamine abuse, given its substantial affect \n     on child welfare in some areas. Funding for the grants must \n     be used to support the purposes of this program, which may \n     include family- based comprehensive long-term substance abuse \n     treatment services, early intervention and prevention \n     services, mental health services, parent skills training, and \n     replication of successful models for providing family-based \n     comprehensive long-term substance abuse treatment services. \n     Grantees must provide a 15 percent match in the first and \n     second year, a 20 percent match in the third and fourth year, \n     and a 25 percent match in the fifth year. In-kind \n     contributions can qualify towards the match requirement. The \n     Secretary of HHS must consult with State leaders to develop \n     performance indicators and reporting is required of all grant \n     recipients.\n       The legislation also redirects current PSSF research \n     funding to support evaluation, research, and technical \n     assistance related to the above two PSSF funding priorities. \n     In each of FYs 2007 through 2011, at least $1 million must be \n     spent for research and technical assistance activities that \n     support monthly caseworker visits and at least $1 million \n     must be spent for research and technical assistance \n     activities with respect to the competitive grant program to \n     promote the well-being of children in or at risk of placement \n     in the child welfare system due to a parent's abuse of \n     methamphetamine or other substances.\n     Reason for Change\n       The targeting of funds to support monthly visits of foster \n     children is in response to research highlighting how monthly \n     visits lead to better outcomes for children. The Child and \n     Family Service Reviews (CFSRs) completed in each State found \n     a strong correlation between frequent caseworker visits with \n     children and positive outcomes for children, such as timely \n     achievement of permanency and other indicators of child well-\n     being. However, despite the fact that nearly all States had \n     written standards suggesting monthly visits were State \n     policy, a December 2005 report completed by the HHS Office of \n     the Inspector General found that only 20 States were able to \n     produce reports showing whether caseworkers actually visited \n     children in foster care on at least a monthly basis. States \n     are encouraged to invest these resources in those activities \n     with proven effectiveness in supporting monthly caseworker \n     visits of foster children and should be cognizant that these \n     funds may not supplant what States already spend from their \n     Title IV-E programs for these activities. These resources are \n     intended to increase State investment in these important \n     areas.\n       Parental substance abuse is a well-known problem affecting \n     the child welfare system, and the Office of Applied Studies \n     of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services \n     Administration reported that the number of new uses of \n     methamphetamines (meth) has increased 72 percent in the past \n     decade. A study by the National Association of Counties which \n     surveyed 300 counties in 13 States reported that meth abuse \n     is a major cause of child abuse and neglect. Forty percent of \n     all the child welfare officials in the survey reported an \n     increase in out-of-home placements due to meth abuse in 2005.\n     Section 5--Allotments and Grants to Indian Tribes\n     Current Law\n       Requires that 1 percent of all mandatory PSSF funds, and 2 \n     percent of any discretionary appropriations for the PSSF \n     program, be set aside for tribal programs. (The minimum \n     tribal funding provided is $3.45 million and the maximum \n     annual tribal funding possible is $7.45 million.)\n       Out of the tribal funds reserved, Indian tribes or tribal \n     organizations with an approved plan must be allotted PSSF \n     funds (based on the relative share of tribal persons under \n     age 21 but only among tribes or tribal organizations with \n     approved plans). The Secretary of HHS may exempt a tribe from \n     any plan requirement that it determines would be \n     inappropriate for that tribe (taking into account the \n     resources, needs, and other circumstances of that tribe). \n     However, no tribe or tribal organization may have an approved \n     plan (or receive funds) unless its allotment is equal to at \n     least $10,000. Funds allotted are paid directly to the tribal \n     organization of the Indian tribe to which the money is \n     allotted.\n     S. 3525\n       The legislation increases the set-aside for tribal programs \n     to 3 percent of any discretionary funds appropriated. It also \n     increases the set-aside for tribal programs to 3 percent of \n     the mandatory funds authorized and which remain after the \n     separate reservation of funds is made for (1) monthly \n     caseworker visits, and (2) competitive grants to combat \n     methamphetamine and other substance abuse. Therefore, the \n     minimum funding available per year for tribal programs would \n     be $9.15 million and the maximum funding would be $15.15 \n     million. The legislation eliminates the ability of the \n     Secretary of HHS to exempt tribes from the PSSF plan \n     requirements related to nonsupplantation, data reporting, and \n     monitoring. However, the Secretary retains the ability to \n     waive for Indian tribes the PSSF requirement to invest \n     significant amounts of program funds in each of the four PSSF \n     activities and to spend no more than 10 percent of PSSF funds \n     on administrative costs.\n       The legislation also permits tribal consortia to have \n     access to an allotment of PSSF funds (and related technical \n     assistance) on the same basis as such funds are currently \n     available to Indian tribes. A tribal consortium's allotment \n     is to be determined based on the number of tribal persons \n     under age 21 in each tribe that is a part of the tribal \n     consortium. If tribes choose to apply collectively as a \n     consortium, the population of tribal persons under age 21 \n     for each tribe would be combined in order to determine the \n     size of the grant to the consortium, including whether the \n     consortium meets the $10,000 eligibility threshold in the \n     Act. A tribal consortium could select which Indian tribal \n     organization (among the tribes in the consortium) would \n     receive the direct payment of its allotment.\n     Reason for Change\n       The legislation recognizes the importance of assisting \n     tribes in their efforts to assist abused and neglected \n     children. The legislation significantly increases the amount \n     of funds provided to tribes and allows tribal consortia to \n     apply for PSSF funds. This step is being taken to encourage \n     the further development of tribal child welfare programs, \n     which largely serve severely disadvantaged communities and \n     families and can do so in a culturally appropriate manner. \n     Permanency outcomes for Indian children can be improved if \n     tribal consortia are able to have access to an allotment of \n     PSSF funding on the same basis as is currently available to \n     Indian tribes. This will facilitate smaller tribes' building \n     their own programs and will allow for administrative \n     efficiencies in tribal program administration.\n       To collect additional data and ensure proper oversight of \n     these funds, tribes and tribal consortia interested in \n     applying for this substantial increase in PSSF funds will be \n     required to adhere to the same data and monitoring plan \n     requirements as States. This additional data will inform how \n     these funds have helped the tribes better ensure the safety, \n     permanency, and well-being of tribal children.\n     Section 6--Improvements to the Child Welfare Services (CWS) \n         Program\n     Current Law\n       Up to $325 million annually is authorized on an indefinite \n     basis for the Child Welfare Services (CWS) program, which \n     provides funds to States to support a wide range of child \n     welfare activities. Federal funding represents 75 percent of \n     total funding for this program, and States are required to \n     contribute 25 percent of total CWS funding from State funds.\n     S. 3525\n       The legislation maintains the annual discretionary \n     authorization level of $325 million per year but limits the \n     funding authorization to FYs 2007 through 2011. The \n     legislation also specifies that the purpose of the CWS \n     program for which funds may be expended is to promote State \n     flexibility in the development and expansion of a coordinated \n     child and family services program that utilizes community-\n     based agencies and that ensures all children are raised in \n     safe, loving families, by: (1) protecting and promoting the \n     welfare of all children; (2) preventing the neglect, abuse, \n     or exploitation of children; (3) supporting at-risk families \n     through services which allow children, where appropriate, to \n     remain safely with their families or return to their families \n     in a timely manner; (4) promoting the safety, permanence and \n     well-being of children in foster care and adoptive families; \n     and (5) providing training, professional development and \n     support to ensure a well-qualified child welfare workforce.\n       The legislation eliminates the plan requirements related to \n     child day care standards and those related to the use of \n     paraprofessionals or volunteers and restates and renumbers \n     the remaining provisions with generally the same intent. It \n     rewrites the provision concerning policies and procedures for \n     children abandoned shortly after birth to assert that a State \n     must have in effect administrative and judicial procedures \n     for children who are abandoned at or shortly after birth \n     (including policies and procedures providing for legal \n     representation of the children) to ensure expeditious \n     decisions can be made for their permanent placement. Further, \n     it clarifies that the State may include residential \n     educational programs as a living arrangement for children for \n     whom reunification, adoption, or guardianship have been ruled \n     out as permanency goals. This provision does not undermine \n     current State policies regarding placement of children in \n     adoptive homes and does not eliminate the 25 bed policy.\n\n[[Page S10281]]\n\n       Beginning October 1, 2007 (i.e. the beginning of FY 2008), \n     the legislation limits administrative funding to 10 percent, \n     but defines administrative funds to exclude caseworker \n     services and supervision of such services. Also beginning in \n     FY 2008, the legislation limits how much each State can \n     expend from Federal CWS funding for foster care maintenance \n     payments, adoption assistance payments, or child day care to \n     what the State can show that it spent for such purposes in FY \n     2005. Further, beginning with FY 2008, States are not allowed \n     to use State spending on foster care maintenance payments to \n     meet the State matching requirement to receive Federal CWS \n     fund in amounts that exceed what the State spent from such \n     funds in FY 2005.\n       The legislation also adds new requirements to the CWS plan \n     the State submits to (1) describe how the State consults with \n     and involves physicians and other appropriate medical \n     professionals in the assessment of children in foster care \n     and in determining appropriate medical treatment, and (2) \n     develop a plan on how to respond, track and continue care for \n     children receiving child welfare services in the event of a \n     disaster.\n     Reason for Change\n       The legislation will reorganize and update the CWS program \n     and encourage more effective oversight. It also aligns the \n     program to be coterminous with the reauthorization of the \n     PSSF program to allow for better coordination between the two \n     programs. It will encourage States to invest funding in \n     prevention services, but allows each State to maintain in the \n     coming years its FY 2005 level of spending from Federal CWS \n     funds for foster care, adoption assistance and child care \n     purposes. It adds a new State planning requirement to ensure \n     consultation with medical professionals as well as State \n     planning to continue the availability of child welfare \n     services during a disaster.\n     Section 7--Monthly Caseworker Standard\n     Current Law\n       There is no minimum Federal standard for monthly visits of \n     foster children in State custody.\n     S. 3525\n       The legislation requires the State to update its CWS State \n     plan by October 1, 2007 to describe its standards for the \n     content and frequency of caseworker visits of foster children \n     in State custody, which at a minimum must ensure that \n     children are visited on a monthly basis and that the \n     caseworker visits are well-planned and focused on issues \n     pertinent to case planning and service delivery to ensure the \n     safety, permanency, and well-being of children.\n       The legislation also sets a minimum Federal standard \n     requiring each State and territory to achieve by October 1, \n     2011 monthly caseworker visits for at least 90 percent of \n     foster children in State custody, with the majority of those \n     visits occurring in the child's residence. Each State and \n     territory would be held accountable for its efforts and the \n     legislation prescribes a planning process to achieve this \n     goal. To receive FY 2008 CWS funds, States must submit to HHS \n     data for FY 2007 on the percentage of foster children visited \n     on a monthly basis by their caseworker and the percentage of \n     those visits that occurred in the child's residence. Based on \n     this data, HHS will work with each State to set target levels \n     for the State to meet to achieve a 90 percent monthly \n     visitation standard by FY 2012 and will establish these \n     target levels by June 30, 2008. Then, beginning in FY 2009, \n     States must achieve their annual goal for the percentage of \n     caseworker visits and the percentage of visits that occur in \n     the child's residence, or face an enhanced matching \n     requirement in order to draw down their full allotment of \n     Federal CWS funds. The share of non-Federal spending that is \n     required in a State that does not meet its visitation target \n     level in a year increases by a minimum of 1 percentage point, \n     up to a maximum of 5 percentage points, depending on the \n     degree to which the State has missed its target level; absent \n     the commitment of additional State funds, Federal funds would \n     be reduced to yield the modified State share of overall CWS \n     funding, consistent with the degree of the State's failure to \n     achieve its visitation target for that year.\n       No later than March 31, 2010, HHS must submit to the House \n     Committee on Ways and Means and the Senate Committee on \n     Finance a report that outlines the progress States have made \n     in meeting their caseworker visitation standards and that \n     offers recommendations, developed in consultation with State \n     administrators of child welfare programs and members of State \n     legislatures, to assist States in meeting this standard.\n     Reason for Change\n       Holding States accountable for achieving monthly caseworker \n     visits for at least 90 percent of foster children responds to \n     research highlighting how monthly visits lead to better \n     outcomes for children. HHS shall work with the States to \n     establish a plan to achieve this goal by FY 2012 and States \n     are encouraged to invest the new PSSF resources provided in \n     FY 2006 and later fiscal years in activities that have been \n     shown to be effective in achieving increased caseworker \n     visitation of foster children. The above accountability \n     measure will ensure that, even in the case of a State that \n     fails to fulfill its specified level of caseworker visits, \n     the full Federal CWS allotment to a State will remain \n     available so long as that State increases its State CWS \n     spending modestly, according to the provisions of the \n     legislation.\n     Section 8--Reauthorization of Program for Mentoring Children \n         of Prisoners\n     Current Law\n       The Mentoring Children of Prisoners program is administered \n     by HHS and makes competitive grants to support the \n     establishment or expansion and operation of programs that \n     provide mentoring services to children of prisoners.\n     S. 3525\n       The legislation reauthorizes the existing Mentoring \n     Children of Prisoners program through FY 2011 at such sums as \n     may be necessary and increases the HHS set-aside for \n     research, technical assistance, and evaluation from 2.5 \n     percent to 4 percent. It authorizes a new 3-year pilot \n     program to provide vouchers to qualified mentoring groups to \n     offer services to individual children of prisoners, but \n     specifies both annual caps on funding for this purpose and \n     that at least $25 million must be available each year for \n     site-based grants provided under the program. The voucher \n     pilot program will be administered by a national group that \n     will work closely with HHS to manage the program with the \n     goal to distribute least 3,000 vouchers in the first year, \n     8,000 vouchers in the second year and 13,000 vouchers in the \n     third year. The legislation specifies that the national group \n     must identify in its voucher distribution plan how the group \n     will prioritize providing vouchers to children in areas which \n     have not been served under the current site-based mentoring \n     program. During the third year of this pilot HHS shall \n     provide a report based on an independent evaluation to the \n     House Committee on Ways and Means and the Senate Committee on \n     Finance on the number of children who received vouchers for \n     mentoring services and any conclusions regarding the voucher \n     pilot program's effectiveness.\n     Reason for Change\n       The continuation of the Mentoring Children of Prisoners \n     program will enable public and private organizations to \n     establish or expand projects that provide one-on-one \n     mentoring for children of incarcerated parents and those \n     recently released from prison. At the same time, children \n     have not been able to access mentoring services in some \n     States and rural areas because of the absence of a site-based \n     grant to provide this service. The voucher pilot program will \n     evaluate the effectiveness of using vouchers to expand the \n     delivery of mentoring services to children of prisoners, \n     including to children in rural and underserved areas.\n     Section 9--Reauthorization of the Court Improvement Program\n     Current Law\n       For each of FYs 2002 through 2006, an eligible highest \n     State court (with an approved application) is entitled to a \n     share of funds to assess and make improvements to its \n     handling of child welfare procedures.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor the years of \ndedicated service that William Walter Wilkins, Chief Judge of the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, has given to the Federal \njudiciary. Hailing from my hometown of Greenville, SC, his \ncontributions to South Carolina and our Nation are immeasurable.\n  Chief Judge Wilkins began his public service in 1967 as an officer in \nthe U.S. Army, eventually earning the rank of colonel in the U.S. Army \nReserves. Upon his honorable discharge from the Army, Chief Judge \nWilkins worked as a law clerk for the Honorable Clement F. Haynsworth, \nJr., U.S. Court of Appeals Fourth Circuit until 1970, then going on to \nbecome a legal assistant for the late Senator Strom Thurmond. And \nSenator Thurmond got it exactly right when he called Chief Judge \nWilkins ``a man of character and unquestionable integrity.''\n  While in private practice, Chief Judge Wilkins was elected as the \nfirst Republican Solicitor for the Thirteenth Judicial Circuit since \nReconstruction, a post that showcased his extensive knowledge and \nmastery of the legal profession.\n  In 1981, newly elected President Ronald Reagan used his first \nPresidential appointment to nominate Chief Judge Wilkins to the \nposition of the U.S. District Judge for the District of South Carolina. \nChief Judge Wilkins was confirmed by this body on July 20, 1981 and \nreceived his commission on July 22, 1981.\n  In 1985, President Reagan appointed Chief Judge Wilkins to be the \nfirst Chair of the United States Sentencing Commission, where he was \ngiven the task of creating guidelines for the sentencing of Federal \ndefendants. He served in this capacity until 1994. During that time, he \nwas also appointed to be U.S. Circuit Judge for the Fourth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals, where he has served as Chief Judge since 2003.\n  Chief Judge Wilkins is a nationally recognized jurist and is known \nfor this scholarship, sharp wit, and unyielding allegiance to the rule \nof law. Not only is the State of South Carolina honored to be the home \nof a man of his integrity, but the United States is privileged to have \nsuch a distinguished jurist defending our American legal system.\n  I commend Chief Judge Wilkins for his 25 years of public service to \nthe United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/27/senate-section/article/S10282-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10282]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HONORING RANDE YEAGER\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \ncommend Rande Yeager, a constituent of mine, on completing a year as \npresident of the American Land Title Association, ALTA. He ably \nrepresented the land title industry at a time when the value and public \npolicy purposes of title insurance and the maintenance of land records \ncame under challenge.\n  His leadership of ALTA over this past year was a natural extension of \nhis corporate experience. As president of Old Republic National Title \nInsurance Company, one of the leading title underwriters in this \ncountry and my State of Minnesota, Rande has experience being both a \nleader and a spokesperson for a large company.\n  As ALTA president, Rande made numerous trips to State conventions \nacross the country to get to know his colleagues better, hear their \nconcerns for their businesses and the industry, and came back ready to \nfind out how ALTA could help. He also came to Washington to promote the \nimportance of title insurance and land record maintenance.\n  ALTA has been well served by Rande's leadership. I congratulate him \non his year as president and best wishes on his future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/27/senate-section/article/S10282-3", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10282]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            MIDDLE GEORGIA BUCKS SENIOR BOYS BASKETBALL TEAM\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS.

Not only did they win the 2006 \nAmateur Athletic Union National Championship, AAU, they won the 2006 \nState of Georgia AAU Championship and the 2006 Hoosier Showcase in \nIndianapolis, IN, as well. The Bucks finished the season with an \nundefeated record of 27 wins and 0 losses. On August 1, they claimed \ntheir national victory by defeating the North Carolina Gators by a \nscore of 97 to 75.\n  This resolution recognizes and commends the hard work, tenacity, and \nsteadfast commitment to excellence of the members, parents, coaches, \nand managers of the Middle Georgia Bucks. It also commends the Amateur \nAthletic Union for continuing the tradition of fostering the \ndevelopment of sportsmanship, discipline, and self-assurance in young \nadults. This talented team, managed by Alfonza Hall and coached by \nMelvin Flowers, Chris Cromartie, and Al Hagan, has brought great pride \nto the State of Georgia and the Middle Georgia community, where the \nfans have shown unwavering enthusiasm, support, and admiration for the \nplayers and coaches.\n  Mr. President, I would like to recognize the players individually for \ntheir accomplishment: Lehmon Colbert; LaShun Watson; Anthony Miller; \nTerrell ``Sput'' Dunham; Keith Ramsey; Giles Mack; Antonio Steele; Tay \nWaller; Jarvis Ogletree; Rashad Faust; Sean LeGree; Jermaine Sparks; \nJosh Williams; Akila Carter; and Jeremiah Crutcher.

Mr. President, today I honor the service and \nsacrifice of Officer Jared Jensen.\n  My wife Joan and I were deeply saddened to hear of the death of \nOfficer Jared Jensen while in the line of duty.\n  It takes a person of great courage to become an officer of the law. \nIt takes a strong, hardworking, and considerate individual. It takes a \nspecial someone who is willing to pay the ultimate price in protecting \nthe safety of others.\n  Officer Jared Jensen was just this person. He served the Colorado \nSprings Police Department with honor and valor for more than 3 years. \nOfficer Jared Jensen was a dedicated police officer who had a passion \nfor upholding the law.\n  Officer Jared Jensen was a husband, a brother, and a son. He is \nsurvived by his wife Natalie, a brother, who also serves the Colorado \nSprings Police Department, and his loving parents. Among his many \nhobbies and interests, Officer Jared Jensen was an avid NASCAR racing \nfan and golfer. Throughout his life, Jared's caring heart was evident \nin his devotion to family and friends, his love of animals, and his \nloyalty to his fellow officers with whom he served.\n  The city of Colorado Springs has lost a valuable member of its \ncommunity, and we are all forever grateful for Officer Jared Jensen's \nservice and dedication to the safety and well-being of others. His \nservice to the city of Colorado Springs is highly commendable, and his \ncontributions will be remembered.\n  On October 6, 2006, the Police Cross and Medal of Valor will be \npresented to Officer Jared Jensen, posthumously, and given to his widow \nNatalie at the 21st Annual Medal of Valor Award Ceremony in Colorado \nSprings, Colorado. These awards represent his extraordinary heroism and \nhonorable service to the Colorado Springs Police Department.\n  I extend my deepest appreciation to Officer Jared Jensen.

Mr. President, I want to take this moment to call \nthe Senate's attention to a historic agreement that was signed today \nbetween the Federal Highways Administration and the Assiniboine & Sioux \ntribes at the Fort Peck Reservation in Montana.\n  Today, Fort Peck entered into an agreement with FHWA to directly \nmanage highway funds for the reservation, allowing increased focus on \nthe local needs of tribal members. Fort\n\n[[Page S10283]]\n\nPeck is one of five tribes that were selected for this new partnership. \nBy empowering the tribes to administer these funds directly, FHWA is \nrecognizing the critical need for improved transportation \ninfrastructure on tribal lands. From increased safety to economic \ndevelopment, tribal authorities are best suited to direct this funding \nin a manner that will serve the needs of their communities.\n  In the recently passed highway bill, the Indian reservation roads \naccount was substantially increased, which also demonstrates the \nFederal commitment to tribal transportation needs. I was pleased to \nsupport this increase, and even more pleased that Montana is leading \nthe way in this new era of government-to-government cooperation in \nadministering these funds.\n  I am a firm believer that empowering folks on the ground to address \nthe specific needs of their communities generally yields the best \nresults, and no where is that more true than in Indian Country. \nMontana's tribes are working tirelessly to improve the quality of life \nfor their people, and investing in basic infrastructure, like roads, is \nthe foundation of economic growth in these rural areas. Safe, reliable \nroads are needed to get kids to school, people to work, and products to \nmarket. This is a basic need we are talking about here, and I am \nconfident that the leaders at the Fort Peck reservation are best suited \nto tackle these challenges.\n  I would like to congratulate Fort Peck and FHWA for this \ngroundbreaking partnership. I am hopeful that we can build on this \ninitiative and expand the ability of tribal leaders to shape the future \nof their people. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/27/senate-section/article/S10283-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10283]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   HONORING ADMIRAL JOHN WILLIAM KIME\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment today \nto honor and pay tribute to ADM John William Kime, the 19th commandant \nof the Coast Guard who passed away on September 14, 2006.\n  During his distinguished 41-year career in the Coast Guard, Admiral \nKime embodied the ideals of superior public service. An officer of \ngreat vision and ability, his leadership as the Commandant of the Coast \nGuard from 1990 to 1994 left an indelible legacy of resource \nstewardship, environmental protection, and increased national security.\n  Admiral Kime graduated from the U.S. Coast Guard Academy in 1957. \nFollowing graduation, he immediately went to sea, serving in both deck \nand engineering assignments aboard the Coast Guard cutter Casco. In \n1960, he assumed command of Loran Station Wake Island.\n  After his tour of duty in the South Pacific, Admiral Kime earned \nmasters degrees in marine engineering and naval engineering from the \nMassachusetts Institute of Technology and embarked on what ultimately \nbecame his lifelong professional passion: improving the safety and \nsecurity of this Nation's maritime interests.\n  Admiral Kime commanded the Marine Safety Office in Baltimore, and \nserved as the principal U.S. negotiator at the International Maritime \nOrganization, IMO, conference in London where he was a key contributor \nduring drafting of the liquefied gas container ship safety codes. Also \nduring his time in Washington, Admiral Kime oversaw the structural \ndesign of the Coast Guard's Polar Class icebreakers--two vessels that \nhave proven to be the anvil upon which this Nation's scientific \nresearch at the Earth's poles has been forged.\n  While commanding the Coast Guard's Eleventh District, Admiral Kime \nwas summoned to direct the Federal response to the Exxon Valdez oil \nspill, an event of national significance that influenced the rest of \nhis career. Admiral Kime went on to serve as Chief of the Marine \nSafety, Security and Environmental Division in Washington DC and was \nultimately confirmed by the 101st Congress as Commandant of the U.S. \nCoast Guard in 1990.\n  As Commandant, Admiral Kime oversaw implementation of the landmark \nOil Pollution Act of 1990. This act streamlined and strengthened the \nFederal Government's ability to prevent and respond to catastrophic oil \nspills. For his immense successes in improving commercial shipping \nregulations, he was awarded the 1993 International Maritime Prize by \nthe International Maritime Organization.\n  From overseeing the structural design of our Polar ice breaking fleet \nto pioneering improvements in the way our Nation prevents and responds \nto oil spills in the wake of the Exxon Valdez disaster, Admiral Kime's \ninfluence and energy remains visible in the wonderful performance of \nthe U.S. Coast Guard today.\n  Mr President, I ask all Members of the Senate to join me in \nrecognizing Admiral Kime's service in our Nation's Coast Guard and \nremembering both his life and his dedication to the United States of \nAmerica.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/27/senate-section/article/S10283-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10283-S10284]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            HONORING THE SERVICE OF DR. DOROTHY C. STRATTON\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, on September 17, 2006, this Nation \nlost another distinguished member of our ``greatest generation,'' Dr. \nDorothy Constance Stratton. She was 107.\n  An inspirational leader and true patriot, Dr. Stratton was born in \nMarch of 1899, attended high school in the Midwest, and graduated from \nOttawa University with a bachelor of arts degree in 1933. She went on \nto earn a master of arts degree in psychology from the University of \nChicago and a doctorate of philosophy from Columbia University.\n  After earning her degrees, Dr. Stratton became the first full-time \ndean of women at Purdue University. Always committed to establishing a \nmore positive and constructive atmosphere for women on campus, her \npioneering force brought to life a vision to make science more \nappealing to women. With enthusiasm and energy, she developed an \nexperimental curriculum that proved successful and increased \nundergraduate enrollment of women at Purdue from 600 to over 1,400.\n  In 1942, as the dark clouds of World War II gathered over our Nation, \nDr. Statton felt compelled to duty and took a leave of absence from \nPurdue to join the Naval Women's Reserve. Shortly after receiving her \ncommission in the Navy as a lieutenant, President Roosevelt signed an \namendment to Public Law 773, thereby establishing the Coast Guard's \nWomen Reserve.\n  Known for her brilliance as an organizer and administrator, a newly \npromoted Lieutenant Commander Stratton was sworn in as Coast Guard \nWomen's Reserve new director, simultaneously making Dr. Statton the \nfirst women accepted for service as a commissioned officer in the \nhistory of the U.S. Coast Guard.\n  Lieutenant Commander Stratton immediately left her mark on the newly \nestablished Reserve Service. Shortly after accepting the position of \ndirector she sent a memo to wartime Coast Guard Commandant ADM Russell \nR. Waesche. Dr. Stratton wrote, ``The motto of the Coast Guard is \n`Semper Paratus--Always Ready.' The initials of this motto are, of \ncourse, S-P-A-R. Why not call the members of the Women's Reserve \nSPARs?. . . . As I understand it, a spar is a supporting beam and that \nis what we hope each member or the Women's Reserve will be.'' And so \nthey were.\n  Under Stratton's inspiring leadership the newly named SPARs expanded \nto include nearly 1,000 officers and over 10,0000 enlisted women. These \ndedicated, selfless women initially replaced men working in traditional \nclerical and routine services at shore stations, but as the war \nprogressed, SPARs worked as parachute riggers, pilot trainer operators, \naviation machinists' mates, and air control tower operators. Known as \nthe ``women behind the men behind the guns,'' their duties eventually \nextended to include the most important port security, logistical, and \nadministrative jobs. By wars end, the SPARs successes had forever \nchanged the role of women in the Coast Guard, and Dr. Stratton had been \npromoted to the rank of captain, another first for the U.S. Coast \nGuard.\n  Following her time as SPAR director, Dr. Stratton became the first \ndirector of personnel at the International Monetary Fund, followed by \nservice as executive director of the Girl Scouts of the U.S.A. She was \nalso the United Nations representative of the International Federation \nof University Women.\n  History is replete with events demonstrating the service and \nsacrifices\n\n[[Page S10284]]\n\nmade by American women. More than 400,000 women served during World War \nII. We are humbled by their love and dedication to our Nation.\n  I ask my colleagues to join with me today in honoring and recognizing \nCAPT Dorothy Stratton for her service to the United States, the U.S. \nCoast Guard and its Reserve, and for the inspiration and legacy she \ncreated for the women of this great Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/27/senate-section/article/S10284-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10284]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNIZING MISSOURI ORGANIZATIONS\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity \nto recognize the valuable efforts of the Missouri National Guard, \nMissouri School Boards' Association, and National Guard Bureau as they \nhave collaborated to support Missouri's prototypical satellite/wireless \ncommunications efforts. They have significantly contributed to our \nknowledge and experience in delivering interagency, interoperable \ncommunications capabilities relevant to both the Nation and Show Me \nstate.\n  The Missouri School Boards' Association has closely collaborated with \nthe National Guard to demonstrate that a limited amount of Federal \nfunding can be leveraged to provide for the creation of interagency, \ninteroperable, satellite/wireless, disaster response communications \ncapability, creating reliable local, State and Federal communications \ninfrastructure. This capability can support a number of initiatives, \nincluding first responder training, distance learning, telemedicine, \nand local law enforcement. It is significant to note that a critical \ncomponent of this demonstration effort is to prove that various \nagencies can leverage common, shared infrastructure, which reduces \nsustainment costs and improves government efficiency. Every indication \nis that this model can successfully support information security and \nnetwork defense requirements.\n  Since beginning the Missouri effort, much has already been learned. \nLessons learned include: interagency interoperability offers an \nopportunity to transform how we communicate and for significant cost \navoidance, including the reduction of annual recurring costs; \nimpediments to interagency interoperability are not because the \ntechnology is unavailable or because security requirements cannot be \naddressed; and challenges and opportunities related to successful \ninteragency communications interoperability exist at all local, State, \nand Federal Government levels.\n  The Missouri National Guard has validated the use of affordable \nsatellite technology to create reliable, redundant disaster response \nnetwork communications. The National Guard has leveraged existing \nresources and teamed with State and Federal agencies to confirm the \nreliability and capabilities of a planned network. Ongoing activities \nto support these efforts, resourced largely from federal FY05 funds, \ninclude defining the procurement process related to executing this \neffort; completing a foundational analysis, the development of ``white \npapers,'' to define the precise relevance of the effort; completing \nrequired Department of Defense accreditation of deployable \ncommunications capabilities; completing a national survey of \ncommunications requirements, capabilities, and existing shortfalls to \nconfirm that there is a national need for this type of capability; \nproviding deployable communications capabilities for testing/\nvalidation. These capabilities will directly support the National \nGuard, as well as legitimize the concept that state government prior to \nand during times of emergency can leverage Guard equipment; and \nproviding deployable communications capabilities to be shared with the \nMissouri School Boards' Association in order that the association, \nduring nonemergency situations, can validate applications with schools.\n  With remaining Federal funds appropriated in fiscal year 2005, the \nMissouri School Boards' Association will also coordinate an effort to \nvalidate the ability to leverage emerging wireless technologies in a \ndefined geographical area in Missouri. This demonstration will also \nvalidate the relevance of IPTV, Internet protocol television, with \nwireless technologies so that field-based educational opportunities can \nbe transmitted ``live'' to school classrooms. From Federal fiscal year \n2006 funds, the Missouri School Boards' Association will coordinate a \nwireless demonstration project in a second defined geographical area in \nMissouri. This project will incorporate lessons learned from the \ninitial demonstration project in a defined geographical space.\n  Once again, I thank the Missouri National Guard, Missouri School \nBoards' Association, and National Guard Bureau for their work to \nsupport Missouri's prototypical satellite/wireless communications \nefforts. It is an outstanding example of collaboration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/27/senate-section/article/S10284-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10284-S10285]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         COMMENDATION TO THE ``BACK TO BUSINESS'' RADIO PROGRAM\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, as chair of the Senate Committee on \nSmall Business and Entrepreneurship, I rise today to commend the \nUniversity of Maine and Machias Savings Bank for underwriting the \n``Back To Business'' radio program hosted by Deb Neuman for a second \nyear.\n  Heard on WVOM in Old Town, ME, Back To Business is an advice and news \nprogram geared specifically toward fostering the creation, development, \nand continued success of small businesses in Maine. It has been a \nstrong, supportive, and unwavering voice for Maine's small businesses, \nproviding an interactive forum that discusses pressing issues of the \nday, such as small business access to investment capital, regulatory, \nand tax compliance burdens, and the lack of affordable health insurance \noptions in Maine.\n  The small business owners that appear on ``Back To Business'' \nfrequently cite Maine's business climate as challenging on several \nfronts. Moving forward, it is critical that we also think forward and \nequip America's small businesses with the knowledge and tools to \nconfront the challenges of tomorrow so that they can create jobs and \ncontinue to strengthen our economy. I can proudly report that ``Back To \nBusiness'' offers Maine small businesses vital knowledge and useful \ntools and resources. We must not forget that the Federal and State \ngovernments should be partners, working together with the business \ncommunity to support small businesses.\n  Small businesses create nearly three-quarters of all net new jobs, \nrepresent 97 percent of all business in Maine, and employ 61 percent of \nMaine's workers. Mainers are more than ever relying upon small business \nownership as an alternative to the traditional workplace where the \nmanufacturing industry and corporate America once offered life long \nfutures for workers.\n  As chair of the Senate Small Business Committee, I have introduced an \nambitious legislative agenda to break down small business barriers. I \nrecently introduced a bill that would expand the Small Business \nAdministration's Historically Underutilized Business Zones or HUBZones \nprogram to include rural Maine towns and regions that were previously \nineligible. According to the SBA, 110 Maine businesses in 11 counties \nreceived more than $12.7 million in HUBZone Program dollars in fiscal \nyear 2005. Unfortunately, current law is preventing more regions in \nMaine from being certified as HUBZones. Under my bill, small businesses \nin rural Maine, including the Katahdin region, would be classified as \nHUBZones to qualify and compete for Federal contracts and subcontracts.\n  I have also worked hard to find a solution to the small business \nhealth insurance crisis. Small businesses in Maine and across the \ncountry are trapped in stagnant, dysfunctional insurance markets with \npremiums that are increasing at exponential percentage levels. Last \nyear, I requested a Government Accountability Office Report that showed \na startling market consolidation. In Maine, five large insurance \ncompanies control 98 percent of the market, leaving small businesses \nwith few affordable coverage options.\n  This is why I have long championed legislation that would create \nSmall Business Health Plans, which would allow small businesses to pool \ntogether nationally, to offer quality health insurance products to \ntheir employees at significantly lower costs. This year we came closer \nthan ever before to passing SBHPs into law, and I will continue to push \nforward with my colleagues on both sides of the political aisle, to \nfashion bipartisan legislation that can be\n\n[[Page S10285]]\n\nsigned into law to bring small businesses relief.\n  Mr. President, I again commend WVOM's ``Back to Business'' program, \nwhich is a true public service to Mainers. Their mission to educate \nelected officials, opinion leaders, and the people of Maine about the \nimportance of small businesses to our economy and our country is \ninvaluable.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/27/senate-section/article/S10285-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10285]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            GFWC TRAVELERS CLUB CELEBRATES 100TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. THUNE.

Mr. President, today I recognize the Custer Senior \nCenter of Custer, SD, on its 35th anniversary. Custer Senior Center \ntruly deserves this recognition for its years of service to the seniors \nof Custer and of South Dakota.\n  The Custer Senior Center first began when VISTA volunteers Peggy and \nDavid Viers placed an advertisement in the Custer Chronicle asking \nthose interested in starting a community senior center to meet at the \nCommunity Church on April 6, 1970. The citizens of Custer came together \nand the Senior Center officially opened in May of 1970 with 52 charter \nmembers.\n  Since this time, the Custer Senior Center has provided an invaluable \ncommunity service by creating a welcoming place for Custer's senior \ncitizens to meet together for fellowship and support. I am confident \nthat the Senior Center will continue to bring together Custer's \ncitizens of all ages in the years to come.\n  I would like to offer my congratulations to the Custer Senior Center \non their 35th anniversary and wish them the best of luck as they \ncelebrate this important event.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/27/senate-section/article/S10285-3", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10285]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 9:33 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House agrees \nto the report of the committee of conference on the disagreeing votes \nof the two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n5631) making appropriations for the Department of Defense for the \nfiscal year ending September 30, 2007, and for other purposes.\n  The message also announced that the House agrees to the amendments of \nthe Senate to the amendments of the House to the bill (S. 3525) to \namend subpart 2 of part B of title IV of the Social Security Act to \nimprove outcomes for children in families affected by methamphetamine \nabuse and addiction, to reauthorize the promoting safe and stable \nfamilies program, and for other purposes.\n  The message further announced that the House has passed the bill (S. \n403) to amend title 18, United States Code, to prohibit taking minors \nacross State lines in circumvention of laws requiring the involvement \nof parents in abortion decisions, with an amendment, in which it \nrequests the concurrence of the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/27/senate-section/article/S10285-4", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10285]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ENROLLED BILLS SIGNED\n\n  The message also announced that the Speaker has signed the following \nenrolled bills:\n\n       S. 1275.

A bill to study the geographic areas in Mexico from which \nillegal immigrants are entering the United\n\n[[Page S10290]]\n\nStates and to develop plans to address the social, political, and \neconomic conditions that are contributing to such illegal immigration; \nto the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, like all of my colleagues in this body, I \nrecognize that our immigration system needs vast improvements. While we \nhave spent a great deal of time discussing immigration over the past \nyear, it appears unlikely that this body will pass comprehensive reform \nbefore we break for the recess. This week we have been discussing an \nimportant bill that would begin the process completely securing our \nsouthern border. I support that bill wholeheartedly and I would also \nhope to make other improvements to our immigration laws we can make \nbefore we end this session.\n  Today, therefore, I'm proposing four separate bills intended to \nstrengthen our immigration system.\n  One will help military men and women become citizens more quickly, \nanother will make it easier to remove gang members from our country, \nanother will impose tough penalties on people who tunnel beneath our \nborders, and the fourth will begin an effort to stop illegal \nimmigration at its source.\n  I'd like to discuss all four bills briefly . . . they have different \npurposes and will all complement each other in efforts to improve our \nimmigration system.\n  I am introducing the Community Protection Against International Gangs \nAct. Street gangs remain the bane of our society. Their members sell \nnarcotics, steal, and commit horrific acts of violence. Many of these \ngangs--groups like Mara Salvatrucha, better known as MS-13--draw their \nmembership from immigrants to the United States. While the overwhelming \nmajority of immigrants in the United States obey the law, those who \njoin these gangs wreak havoc on immigrant communities all over the \ncountry.\n  To protect our Nation, we need to stop them . . . now.\n  Thus, I'm proposing the CPAIGA Act. This law will make our policy \nclear: immigrants who join gangs are no longer welcome in our country. \nUnder my bill, anyone who joins a gang or helps one faces immediate \ndeportation proceedings. In addition, my bill will let the Secretary of \nState and the Secretary of Homeland Security deny visas to the \nnationals of any country that refuses to take back its own criminals.\n  I am also introducing the Enhanced Border Tunnel Prevention Act. To \nenhance our crackdown on sophisticated criminal conspiracies, we should \nalso impose tough new penalties on those who construct tunnels under \nour border. People who build tunnels, or allow them to be built on land \nthat they own or control, should face serious time in prison. Smugglers \nwho use them should have their penalties doubled. We can't allow our \nborders to become a sieve.\n  In addition, I am introducing the Soldiers to Citizens Act. Just as \nwe make it clear that criminals have no place in the United States, we \nshould simultaneously do everything we can to welcome the finest people \nfrom around the world. Every year, over 8,000 people who are not U.S. \ncitizens enlist in our armed forces.\n  They serve with valor and distinction . . . they defend our liberty. \nIf they wish to become citizens, they should not face unnecessary \nburdens.\n  Under my legislation, anyone who gives our military 2 years of \nhonorable and satisfactory service can acquire citizenship under an \nexpedited process. Service in the military strongly implies that a \nperson has acquired the things we expect from new citizens: a command \nof English, good moral character, understanding of our history and \nappreciation for our democratic institutions. Thus, soldiers, sailors, \nairmen, and marines whose chains of command certify that they've met \nthese requirements should be able to acquire citizenship by filling out \nsome simple paperwork and swearing the citizenship oath.\n  I believe that the Senate should do everything it can to speed the \ncitizenship process for others in the military who do not want to avail \nthemselves of this process. In particular, we must do away with the \nburdensome, duplicative process that requires military enlistees to \ngive fingerprints once when they join the military and again when they \napply for citizenship. At the same time, we should establish a high-\nquality, toll-free information center to provide timely, accurate \ninformation to any servicemember interested in becoming a citizen.\n  Finally, I am introducing the Illegal Immigration Source Study and \nFocus Act. Finally, I believe we need to do more to deal with the \nunderlying causes of much illegal immigration: social, economic, and \npolitical conditions in Mexico that lead many to believe they have no \nchoice but as to leave their homeland. Illegal immigration hurts both \nthe United States and Mexico. Our governments must work together so we \ncan understand what areas produce the most illegal immigrants and what \nwe might do to help immigrants.\n  My bill would begin a process of collaboration. It will mandate \nregular reports on the areas that produce the most illegal immigrants \nand, just as importantly, focus our own aid to Mexico on improving the \nconditions that produce illegal immigration in the first place.\n  Steps like those I have proposed will not change our immigration \nsystem overnight. They will not end illegal immigration.\n  But they will make our cities safer, stem the flow of illegal \nimmigration, and help those who serve in our armed forces. These are \nworthy measures and I urge all of my colleagues to support them.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bills be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bills was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3946\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \ncredit against income tax for qualified equity investments in certain \nsmall businesses; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n[[Page S10292]]\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, to help start-up small businesses obtain \naccess to capital, today I rise with my colleague Senator Kerry to \nintroduce the Access to Capital for Entrepreneurs Act of 2006 or ACE \nAct. Our bill would encourage equity investments in qualified small \nbusinesses by providing so-called ``angel investors'' with a tax \nincentive to fund new small business enterprises. Angel investors are \nhigh-net-worth individuals who invest in and support start-up companies \nin the critical early stages of growth.\n  As Chair of the Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, I meet with prospective entrepreneurs in Maine and \nacross the country and repeatedly hear about their dreams of starting \ndynamic new businesses. Unfortunately, their hopes can sometimes be \ndashed when these entrepreneurs encounter barriers to raising the funds \nthey need to get their ``start-up'' enterprises off the ground.\n  For entrepreneurs and other aspiring small business owners, a self-\nevident truth since the founding of our country is that it takes money \nto make money. Our legislation makes that goal a little easier for \naspiring small business owners by ensuring that our entrepreneurs have \naccess to venture capital and credit markets so they can continue to \ndrive America's economic growth and job creation. Since small \nbusinesses represent 99 percent of all employers and create nearly 75 \npercent of all net new jobs, Congress must do everything within its \npower to help them grow and thrive.\n  Under the Access to Capital for Entrepreneurs Act of 2006, angel \ninvestors would be eligible for a 25 percent tax credit to offset up to \n$500,000 of investments per year. Because the legislation limits the \ninvestment per small business to $250,000, which is the amount a \ntypical entrepreneur requires to begin operations, an investor would \nhave to invest in at least two companies to receive the full $500,000 \ntax credit. To qualify for the tax incentive, the angel investor must \nhave an income of $200,000 over a two-year period, or net worth of $1 \nmillion. It's patterned after successful tax credits that have been \nenacted in 21 states, including Maine.\n\n  Recent research shows that venture capitalists are now targeting \ntheir investments for larger businesses or for later in a business's \ndevelopment, leaving precious little seed money for new ventures. \nToday, venture capitalists invest an average of $7 million per deal, an \namount that far exceeds the needs of a nascent small business. \nMoreover, in 2005, of the $21.7 billion invested by venture \ncapitalists, just 3.3 percent was allocated to start-up small \nbusinesses.\n  There were 227,000 angel investors who were active in 2005. Yet there \nare hundreds of thousands more waiting to be created. IRS statistics \nshow that the ratio of potential to active angel investors is between 7 \nto 1 and 10 to 1. There is an enormous untapped market of future \ninvestors who we can call to help finance emerging small businesses in \nvirtually every sector of the economy.\n  Our bill would remedy this situation by encouraging more angel \ninvestors to fund more of our Nation's smallest businesses. These \nbusinesses are critical to the economy, as they generate 60 percent to \n80 percent of net new jobs and contribute more than 50 percent of non-\nfarm private-sector output.\n  In addition, if the provisions of the ACE Act are signed into law, \nmany small businesses that would otherwise fail for lack of adequate \nresources could grow and expand, creating more jobs for Americans, and \nfurther bolstering our Nation's economy. With no incentive, angel \ninvestments helped create 198,000 jobs in the United States during \n2005. Imagine how many more jobs we could create if we enact the tax \ncredit we are proposing today.\n  I am committed to supporting our Nation's small business community by \nincreasing its access to capital. The entrepreneurial spirit of our 25 \nmillion small businesses dates back to our Nation's founding. From \nfamily farms to software development, small businesses are the heart of \nour economy and the linchpin for the innovation that moves our country \nforward. Americans who assume the risks and responsibilities inherent \nin owning and operating a business deserve our praise, admiration and \nunwavering support.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3950\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nemployees not covered by qualified retirement plans to save for \nretirement through automatic payroll deposit IRAs, to facilitate \nsimilar savings by the self-employed, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues, Senator \nSmith and Senator Kerry, to introduce this important legislation that \nwill ensure that more working Americans have a retirement account. This \nlegislation is the result of the collaborative work done by David John \nof the Heritage Foundation and Mark Iwry of the Retirement Security \nProject to provide a simple, cost-effective way to increase retirement \nsecurity for our Nation's workers who currently do not have a \nretirement plan. The Automatic IRA Act of 2006 will require employers \nwho do not currently sponsor a retirement plan to offer their workers \nthe opportunity to have part of their paycheck to be sent directly to \nan IRA. This will not only help millions of Americans begin saving for \ntheir retirement but will also provide subtle encouragement to \nemployers to sponsor a qualified retirement account such as a SIMPLE or \na 401(k).\n  In 2004, it was estimated that as many as 71 million Americans work \nfor an employer who does not offer them any kind of retirement plan--\nalmost half of all of our country's workers. Without an employer-\nsponsored retirement plan, many of these workers will not be saving \nadequately for their retirement. The first steps to addressing this \ngrowing inequity are to ensure that all workers have easy access to a \nretirement account and the ability to have part of their wages go \ndirectly from their paycheck into this account. Both of these features \nhave been proven to encourage retirement savings and are imperative if \nwe are going to address our national retirement savings rate.\n  Under this legislation, all employers with more than 10 employees who \ndo\n\n[[Page S10294]]\n\nnot sponsor a qualified retirement or pension plan must offer its \nemployees the ability to have wages remitted directly to an automatic \nIRA through payroll deduction. These employers will not be required to \nmake any contributions to these accounts and will receive a tax credit \nto offset the administrative costs of remitting part of the employee's \nwages to the IRA. It is entirely up to the employer as to what IRA \noptions the employees would have. For instance, the employer could \ndecide to remit the funds to the IRA of the employee's choice or the \nemployer could decide to remit the money to the financial institution \nof his or her choice. The employer will also have a new option--the \nability to remit the money to a new, simplified type of IRA, the \nautomatic IRA. A board, similar to the Federal Government's existing \nThrift Savings Plan Board, would create standards for these new \naccounts that must be followed by participating financial service \ncompanies. This board will also be responsible for educating the public \nabout the importance of having a qualified retirement account as part \nof their duties.\n  Mr. President, it is going to take a bipartisan approach to address \nour Nation's retirement savings problems. I again want to applaud the \nefforts made by Mr. John of the Heritage Foundation and Mr. Iwry from \nthe Retirement Security Project in advancing this proposal. It is now \nup to all of us in this Chamber to follow their example and pass this \nlegislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the material be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    The Retirement Security Project\n\n\n     pursuing universal retirement security through automatic iras\n\n    (Testimony before the Subcommittee on Long-Term Growth and Debt \n Reduction, Committee on Finance, United States Senate, June 29, 2006)\n\n       Chairman Smith, Ranking Member Kerry, and Senator Grassley, \n     we appreciate the opportunity to testify before you. We are \n     submitting our testimony as a single joint statement because \n     we believe strongly in the need for a common strategy to \n     expand retirement savings, and in the importance of \n     approaching these issues in a manner that transcends \n     ideological and partisan differences.\n       At the request of Committee staff, this written statement \n     focuses on our proposal to expand retirement savings for \n     small business workers--the automatic IRA. We are pleased by \n     the positive reaction the proposal has received and are \n     grateful to our colleagues, including those in government and \n     in various stakeholder organizations, who have contributed to \n     these ideas.\n       With the looming retirement security crisis facing our \n     country, policy-makers from both parties are focused on ways \n     to strengthen pensions and increase savings. Our proposal for \n     automatic IRAs would provide a relatively simple, cost-\n     effective way to increase retirement security for the \n     estimated 71 million workers whose employers (usually smaller \n     businesses) do not sponsor plans. It would enable these \n     employees to save for retirement by allowing them to have \n     their employers regularly transfer amounts from their \n     paycheck to an IRA.\n       We are by no means suggesting that the automatic IRA \n     proposal is the only step that should be taken to expand \n     retirement savings for small business workers. In fact, we \n     have long believed in the primacy of employer-sponsored \n     retirement plans as vehicles for pension coverage. \n     Additionally, we continue to advocate strongly for the \n     expansion of pension coverage through automatic features in \n     401(k) and similar retirement savings plans.\n       The automatic 401(k) approach makes intelligent use of \n     defaults--the outcomes that occur when individuals are unable \n     or unwilling to make an affirmative choice or otherwise fail \n     to act--to enlist the power of inertia to promote saving. \n     Automating enrollment, escalation of contributions, \n     investment, and rollovers expands coverage in several ways. \n     Enrolling employees in a plan unless they opt out increases \n     significantly the number of eligible employees who \n     participate in the plan. Escalating the amount of the default \n     contribution tends to increase the amount people save over \n     time. Providing for a default investment (which participants \n     can reject in favor of other alternatives) reflecting \n     consensus investment principles such as diversification and \n     asset allocation tends to raise the expected investment \n     return on contributions. Finally, making retention or \n     rollover of benefits rather than consumption the default when \n     an employee leaves a job furthers the long-term preservation \n     of retirement savings for their intended purposes. By helping \n     improve performance under the nondiscrimination standards and \n     generally making plans more effective in providing retirement \n     benefits, the automatic 401(k) can also encourage more \n     employers to sponsor or continue sponsoring plans.\n       The automatic IRA builds on the success of the automatic \n     401(k). Moreover, as explained below, we would intend and \n     expect the introduction of automatic IRAs to expand the \n     number of employers that choose to sponsor 401(k) or SIMPLE \n     plans instead of offering only automatic IRAs. But for \n     millions of workers who continue to have no employer plan, \n     the automatic IRA would provide a valuable retirement savings \n     opportunity.\n       The automatic IRA proposal is set out in the remainder of \n     this written statement.\n\n                     Executive Summary of Proposal\n\n       This testimony proposes an ambitious but practical set of \n     initiatives to expand dramatically retirement savings in the \n     United States--especially to those not currently offered an \n     employer-provided retirement plan. The essential strategy \n     here, as in the case of the automatic 401(k) described above, \n     is to make saving more automatic--and hence easier, more \n     convenient, and more likely to occur. As noted, making saving \n     easier by making it automatic has been shown to be remarkably \n     effective at boosting participation in 401(k) plans, but \n     roughly half of U.S. workers are not offered a 401(k) or any \n     other type of employer-sponsored plan. Among the 153 million \n     working Americans in 2004, over 71 million worked for an \n     employer that did not sponsor a retirement plan of any kind, \n     and another 17 million did not participate in their \n     employer's plan. This testimony explores a new and, we \n     believe, promising approach to expanding the benefits of \n     automatic saving to a wider array of the population: the \n     ``automatic IRA.''\n       The automatic IRA would feature direct payroll deposits to \n     a low-cost, diversified individual retirement account. Most \n     American employees not covered by an employer-sponsored \n     retirement plan would be offered the opportunity to save \n     through the powerful mechanism of regular payroll deposits \n     that continue automatically (an opportunity now limited \n     mostly to 401(k)-eligible workers).\n       Employers above a certain size (e.g., 10 employees) that \n     have been in business for at least two years but that still \n     do not sponsor any plan for their employees would be called \n     upon to offer employees this payroll-deduction saving option. \n     These employers would receive a temporary tax credit for \n     simply serving as a conduit for saving, by making regular \n     payroll deposit available to their employees. Employers would \n     receive a small additional tax credit for each employee who \n     participates. Other employers that do not sponsor a plan also \n     would receive the tax credit if they offered payroll \n     deduction saving.\n       Firms would be provided a standard notice to inform \n     employees of the automatic IRA (payroll-deduction saving) \n     option, and a standard form to elicit from each employee a \n     decision either to participate or to opt out. For most \n     employees, the payroll deductions would be made by direct \n     deposit similar to the very common direct deposit of \n     paychecks to employees' accounts at their financial \n     institutions.\n       To maximize participation, employers would be provided a \n     standard enrollment module reflecting current best practices \n     in enrollment procedures. The use of automatic enrollment \n     (whereby employees automatically participate at a statutorily \n     specified rate of contribution unless they opt out) would be \n     encouraged in two ways. First, the standard materials \n     provided to employers would be framed so as to present auto \n     enrollment as the presumptive enrollment method, although \n     employer would be able to opt for the alternative of \n     obtaining responses from all employees. Second, employers \n     using auto enrollment to promote participation would not need \n     to obtain responses from unresponsive employees. As discussed \n     earlier, evidence from the 401(k) universe strongly suggests \n     that high levels of participation tend to result not only \n     from auto enrollment but also from the practice of eliciting \n     from each eligible individual an explicit decision to \n     participate or to opt out.\n       Employers making direct deposit or payroll deduction \n     available would be protected from potential fiduciary \n     liability and from having to choose or arrange default \n     investments. Instead, diversified default investments and a \n     handful of standard, low-cost investment alternatives would \n     be specified by statute and regulation. Payroll deduction \n     contributions would be transferred, at the employer's option, \n     to a central repository, which would remit them to IRAs \n     designated by employees or, absent employee designation, to a \n     default collective retirement account.\n       Investment management as well as record keeping and other \n     administrative functions would be contracted to private \n     sector financial institutions to the fullest extent \n     practicable. Costs would be minimized through a no-frills \n     design relying on index funds, economies of scale, and \n     maximum use of electronic technologies, and modeled to some \n     degree on the Thrift Savings Plan for federal government \n     employees. Once accounts reached a predetermined balance \n     (e.g., $15,000) sufficient to make them sufficiently \n     profitable to attract the interest of the full range of IRA \n     providers, account owners would have the option to transfer \n     them to IRAs of their choosing.\n       This approach involves no employer contributions, no \n     employer compliance with qualified plan or ERISA \n     requirements, and, as noted, no employer liability or \n     responsibility for selecting investments, for selecting an \n     IRA provider, or for opening IRAs for employees. It also \n     steers clear of any adverse impact on employer-sponsored \n     plans or on\n\n[[Page S10295]]\n\n     the incentives designed to encourage firms to adopt new \n     plans. In fact, the indirect intended effect of the proposal \n     would be to draw small employers into the private pension \n     system.\n       Our proposed approach would seek to capitalize on the rapid \n     trend toward automated or electronic fund transfers. With the \n     spread of new, low-cost technologies, employers are \n     increasingly using automated or electronic systems to manage \n     payroll, including withholding and federal tax deposits, and \n     for other transfers of funds. Many employers use an outside \n     payroll service provider, an on-line payroll service, or \n     software to perform these functions, including direct deposit \n     of paychecks to accounts designated by employees.\n       For firms already offering direct deposit, including many \n     that use outside payroll providers, direct deposit to an IRA \n     would entail no additional cost, insofar as these systems \n     have unused fields that could be used for the additional \n     direct deposit destination. Other small businesses still \n     write paychecks by hand, complete the federal tax deposit \n     forms and Forms W-2 by hand, and deliver them to employees \n     and to the local depositary institution. Our proposal would \n     not require these employers to make the transition to \n     automatic payroll processing or use of on-line systems \n     (although it might have the effect of encouraging such \n     transitions).\n       At the same time, we would not be inclined to deny payroll \n     deduction savings to all employees of employers that do not \n     yet use automatic payroll processing (and we would not want \n     to give small employers an incentive to drop automatic \n     payroll processing). These employees would benefit from the \n     ability to save through regular payroll deposits at the \n     workplace whether the deposits are made electronically or by \n     hand. Employees would still have the advantages of a method \n     of saving that, once begun, continues automatically, that is \n     more likely to begin because of workplace enrollment \n     arrangements and peer group reinforcement, and that often \n     will not reduce take-home pay. To that end, we outline below \n     a strategy to address these situations efficiently and with \n     minimal cost.\n       For the self-employed and others who have no employer, \n     regular contributions to IRAs would be facilitated in three \n     principal ways: (1) extending the payroll deposit option to \n     many independent contractors who work for employers (other \n     than the very smallest businesses); (2) enabling taxpayers to \n     direct the IRS to make direct deposit of a portion of their \n     income tax refunds; and (3) expanding access to automatic \n     debit arrangements, including on-line and traditional means \n     of access through professional and trade associations that \n     could help arrange for automatic debit and direct deposit to \n     IRAs. Automatic debit essentially replicates the power of \n     payroll deduction insofar as it continues automatically once \n     the individual has chosen to initiate it.\n       In addition, a powerful financial incentive to contribute \n     might be provided by means of matching deposits to the IRAs. \n     Private financial institutions that maintain the accounts \n     could deliver matching contributions and be reimbursed \n     through tax credits.\n\n\n                the basic problem and proposed solution\n\n       In general, the households that tend to be in the best \n     financial position to confront retirement are the 42 percent \n     of the workforce that participate in an employer-sponsored \n     retirement plan. For reasons we have discussed earlier, \n     traditionally, the takeup rate for IRAs (those who contribute \n     as a percentage of those who are eligible) is less than 1 in \n     10, but the takeup rate for employer-sponsored 401(k) plans \n     tends to be on the order of 7 in 10.\n       Moreover, as discussed, an increasing share of 401(k) plans \n     are including automatic features that make saving easier and \n     bolster participation. When firms are not willing to sponsor \n     401(k)-type plans, the automatic IRA proposed here would \n     apply many of the lessons learned from 401(k) plans so that \n     more workers could enjoy automated saving to build assets--\n     but without imposing any significant burden on employers. \n     Employers that do not sponsor plans for their employees could \n     facilitate saving by employees--without sponsoring a plan, \n     without making employer matching contributions, and without \n     complying with plan qualification or fiduciary standards. \n     Employers can help employees save simply by offering to remit \n     a portion of their pay to an IRA, preferably by direct \n     deposit, at little or no cost to the employer.\n       Such direct deposit savings using IRAs would not and should \n     not replace retirement plans, such as pension, profit \n     sharing, 401(k), or SIMPLE-IRA plans. Indeed, the automatic \n     IRA would be carefully designed so as to avoid any adverse \n     effect on employer sponsorship of ``real'' plans, which must \n     adhere to standards requiring reasonably broad or \n     proportionate coverage of moderate and lower-income workers \n     and various safeguards for employees, and which often involve \n     employer contributions. Instead, payroll-deduction direct \n     deposit savings, as envisioned here, would promote wealth \n     accumulation for retirement by filling in the coverage gaps \n     around employer-sponsored retirement plans. Moreover, as \n     described below, the arrangements we propose are designed to \n     set the stage for small employers to ``graduate'' from \n     offering payroll deduction to sponsoring an actual retirement \n     plan.\n\n\n               employee access to payroll deposit saving\n\n       The automatic IRA is a means of facilitating direct \n     deposits to a retirement account, giving employees access to \n     the power of direct deposit saving. In much the same way that \n     millions of employees have their pay directly deposited to \n     their account at a bank or other financial institution, and \n     millions more elect to contribute to 401(k) plans by payroll \n     deduction, employees would have the choice to instruct the \n     employer to send an amount they select directly from their \n     paychecks to an IRA. Employers generally would be required to \n     offer their employees the opportunity to save through such \n     direct deposit or payroll-deduction IRAs.\n       Direct deposit to IRAs is not new. In 1997, Congress \n     encouraged employers not ready or willing to sponsor a \n     retirement plan to at least offer their employees the \n     opportunity to contribute to IRAs through payroll deduction. \n     Both the IRS and the Department of Labor have issued \n     administrative guidance to publicize the payroll deduction or \n     direct deposit IRA option for employers and to ``facilitate \n     the establishment of payroll deduction IRAs.'' This guidance \n     has made clear that employers can offer direct deposit IRAs \n     without the arrangement being treated as employer \n     sponsorship of a retirement plan that is subject to ERISA \n     or qualified plan requirements. However, it appears that \n     few employers actually have direct deposit or payroll-\n     deduction IRAs--at least in a way that actively encourages \n     employees to take advantage of the arrangement. After some \n     years of encouragement by the government, direct deposit \n     IRAs have simply not caught on widely among employers and, \n     consequently, offer little opportunity for employees to \n     save.\n       With this experience in mind, we propose a new strategy \n     designed to induce employers to offer, and employees to take \n     up, direct deposit or payroll deposit saving.\n     Tax credit for employers that serve as conduit for employee \n         contributions\n       Under our proposal, firms that do not provide employees a \n     qualified retirement plan, such as a pension, profit-sharing, \n     or 401(k) plan, would be given an incentive (a temporary tax \n     credit) to offer those employees the opportunity to make \n     their own payroll deduction contributions to IRAs using the \n     employers' payroll systems as a conduit. The tax credit would \n     be available to a firm for the first two years in which it \n     offered payroll deposit saving to an IRA, in order to help \n     the firm adjust to any modest administrative costs associated \n     with the ``automatic IRA.'' This automatic IRA credit would \n     be designed to avoid competing with the tax credit available \n     under current law to small businesses that adopt a new \n     employer-sponsored retirement plan.\n\n\n                 small business new plan startup credit\n\n       Under current law, an employer with 100 or fewer employees \n     that starts a new retirement plan for the first time can \n     generally claim a tax credit for a portion of its startup \n     costs. The credit equals 50 percent of the cost of \n     establishing and administering the plan (including educating \n     employees about the plan) up to $500 per year. The employer \n     can claim the credit of up to $500 for each of the first \n     three years of the plan.\n       Accordingly, the automatic IRA tax credit could be set, for \n     example, at $50 plus $10 per employee enrolled. It would be \n     capped at, say, $250 or $300 in the aggregate--low enough to \n     make the credit meaningful only for very small businesses, \n     and lower than the $500 three-year credit available under \n     current law for establishing a new employer plan. Employers \n     would be precluded from claiming both the new plan startup \n     credit and the proposed automatic IRA credit; otherwise, \n     somewhat larger employers might have a financial incentive to \n     limit a new plan to fewer than all of their employees in \n     order to earn an additional credit for providing payroll \n     deposit saving to other employees. As in the case of the \n     current new plan startup credit, employers also would be \n     ineligible for the credit if they had sponsored a retirement \n     plan during the preceding three years for substantially the \n     same group of employees covered by the automatic IRA.\n       Example: Joe employs four people in his auto body shop, and \n     currently does not sponsor a retirement plan for his \n     employees. If Joe chooses to adopt a 401(k) or SIMPLE-IRA \n     plan, he and each of his employees generally can contribute \n     up to $15,000 (401(k)) or $10,000 (SIMPLE) a year, and the \n     business might be required to make employer contributions. \n     Under this scenario, Joe can claim the startup tax credit for \n     50 percent of his costs over three years up to $500 per year.\n       Alternatively, if Joe decides only to offer his employees \n     payroll deposit to an IRA, the business will not make \n     employer contributions, and Joe can claim a tax credit for \n     each of the next two years of $50 plus $10 for each employee \n     who signs up to contribute out of his own salary.\n       Employers with more than 10 employees that have been in \n     business for at least two years and that still do not sponsor \n     any plan for their employees would be called upon to offer \n     employees this opportunity to save a portion of their own \n     wages using payroll deposit. If the employer sponsored a plan \n     designed to cover only a subset of its employees (such as a \n     particular subsidiary, division or other business unit), it \n     would have to offer the payroll deposit facility to the rest \n     of its workforce (i.e., employees not in that business unit) \n     other than employees excluded from consideration under the \n     qualified plan coverage standards (union-represented \n     employees or nonresident aliens)\n\n[[Page S10296]]\n\n     and those in the permissible qualified plan eligibility \n     waiting period. The arrangement would be structured so as to \n     avoid, to the fullest extent possible, employer costs or \n     responsibilities. The tax credit would be available both to \n     those firms that are required to offer payroll deposit to all \n     of their employees and to the small or new firms that are not \n     required to offer the automatic IRA, but do so voluntarily. \n     The intent would be to encourage, without requiring, the \n     smallest employers to participate.\n     Acting as conduit entails little or no cost to employers\n       For many if not most employers, offering direct deposit or \n     payroll deduction IRAs would involve little or no cost. \n     Unlike a 401(k) or other employer-sponsored retirement plan, \n     the employer would not be maintaining a plan. First, there \n     would be no employer contributions: employer contributions to \n     direct deposit IRAs would not be required or permitted. \n     Employers willing to make retirement contributions for their \n     employees would continue to do so in accordance with the \n     safeguards and standards governing employer-sponsored \n     retirement plans, such as SIMPLE-IRAs, 401(k)s, and \n     traditional pensions. (The SIMPLE-IRA is essentially a \n     payroll deposit IRA with an employee contribution limit that \n     is in between the IRA and 401(k) limits and with employer \n     contributions, but without the annual reports, plan \n     documents, and most of the other administrative requirements \n     applicable to other employer plans.)\n       Employer-sponsored retirement plans are the saving vehicles \n     of choice and should be encouraged; the direct deposit IRA is \n     a fallback designed to apply to employees who are not \n     fortunate enough to be covered under an actual employer \n     retirement plan. (As discussed below, it is also intended to \n     encourage more employers to make the decision sooner or later \n     to ``graduate'' to sponsorship of an employer plan.)\n       Direct deposit or payroll deduction IRAs also would \n     minimize employer responsibilities. Firms would not be \n     required to: comply with plan qualification or ERISA rules; \n     establish or maintain a trust to hold assets (since IRAs \n     would receive the contributions); determine whether employees \n     are actually eligible to contribute to an IRA; select \n     investments for employee contributions; select among IRA \n     providers, or set up IRAs for employees.\n       Employers would be required simply to let employees elect \n     to make a payroll-deduction deposit to an IRA (in the manner \n     described below, with a standard notice informing employees \n     of the automatic IRA (payroll-deposit saving) option, and a \n     standard form eliciting the employee's decision to \n     participate or to opt out. Employer then would implement \n     deposits elected by employees. Employers would not be \n     required to remit the direct deposits to the IRA provider(s) \n     any faster than the timing of the federal payroll deposits \n     they are required to make. (Those deposits generally are \n     required to be made on a standard schedule, either monthly or \n     twice a week.) Nor would employers be required to remit \n     direct deposits to a variety of different IRAs specified by \n     their employees (as explained below).\n       A requirement to offer payroll-deduction to an IRA would by \n     no means be onerous. It would dovetail neatly with what \n     employers already do. Employers of course are already \n     required to withhold federal income tax and payroll tax from \n     employees' pay and remit those amounts to the federal tax \n     deposit system. While this withholding does not require the \n     employer to administer an employee election of the sort \n     associated with direct deposit to an IRA, the tax withholding \n     amounts do vary from employee to employee and depend on the \n     way each employee completes IRS Form W-4 (which employers \n     ordinarily obtain from new hires to help the employer comply \n     with income tax withholding). The employee's payroll deposit \n     IRA election might be made on an attachment or addendum to \n     the Form W-4. Because employees' salary reduction \n     contributions to IRAs would ordinarily receive tax-favored \n     treatment, the employer would report on Form W-2 the reduced \n     amount of the employee's taxable wages together with the \n     amount of the employee's contribution.\n     Direct deposit; automated fund transfers\n       Our proposed approach would seek to capitalize on the rapid \n     trend toward automated or electronic fund transfers. With the \n     spread of new, low-cost technologies, employers are \n     increasingly using automated or electronic systems to manage \n     payroll, including withholding and federal tax deposits, and \n     for other transfers of funds. It is common for employers to \n     retain an outside payroll service provider to perform these \n     functions, including direct deposit of paychecks to accounts \n     designated by employees or contractors. Other employers use \n     an on-line payroll service that offers direct deposit and \n     check printing (or that allows employers to write checks by \n     hand). Still others do not outsource their payroll tax and \n     related functions to a third-party payroll provider but do \n     use readily available software or largely paperless on-line \n     methods to make their federal tax deposits and perhaps other \n     fund transfers, just as increasing numbers of households pay \n     bills and manage other financial transactions on line. (The \n     IRS encourages employers to use its free Electronic Federal \n     Tax Payment System for making federal tax deposits.)\n       For the many firms that already offer their workers direct \n     deposit, including many that use outside payroll providers, \n     direct deposit to an IRA would entail no additional cost, \n     even in the short term, insofar as the employer's system has \n     unused fields that could be used for the additional direct \n     deposit destination. Other small businesses still write their \n     own paychecks by hand, complete the federal tax deposit forms \n     and Forms W-2 by hand, and deliver them to employees and to \n     the local bank or other depositary institution. Our proposal \n     would not require these employers to make the transition to \n     automatic payroll processing or use of on-line systems \n     (although it might have the beneficial effect of encouraging \n     such transitions).\n       At the same time, we would not be inclined to deny the \n     benefits of payroll deduction savings to all employees of \n     employers that do not yet use automatic payroll processing \n     (and we would not want to give small employers an incentive \n     to drop automatic payroll processing). These employees would \n     benefit from the ability to save through regular payroll \n     deposits at the workplace whether the deposits are made \n     electronically or by hand. Employees would still have the \n     advantages of tax-favored saving that, once begun, continues \n     automatically, that is more likely to begin because of \n     workplace enrollment arrangements and peer group \n     reinforcement, and need not cause a visible reduction in \n     take-home pay if begun promptly when employees are hired.\n       Accordingly, we would suggest a three-pronged strategy with \n     respect to employers that do not use automatic payroll \n     processing.\n       First, a large proportion of the employers that still \n     process their payroll by hand would be exempted under the \n     exception for very small employers described below. As a \n     result, this proposal would focus chiefly on those employers \n     that already offer their employees direct deposit of \n     paychecks but have not used the same technology to provide \n     employees a convenient retirement saving opportunity.\n       Second, employers would have the ease of ``piggybacking'' \n     the payroll deposits to IRAs onto the federal tax deposits \n     they currently make. The process, including timing and \n     logistics, for both sets of deposits would be the same. \n     Accompanying or appended to the existing federal tax deposit \n     forms would be a similar payroll deposit savings form \n     enabling the employer to send all payroll deposit savings to \n     a single destination. The small employer who mails or \n     delivers its federal tax deposit check and form to the local \n     bank (or whose accountant or financial provider assists with \n     this) would add another check and form to the same mailing or \n     delivery.\n       Third, as noted, the existing convenient, low-cost on-line \n     system for federal tax deposits would be expanded to \n     accommodate a parallel stream of payroll deduction savings \n     payments.\n       Since employers making payroll deduction savings available \n     to their employees would not be required to make \n     contributions or to comply with plan qualification or ERISA \n     requirements with respect to these arrangements, the cost to \n     employers would be minimal. They would administer and \n     implement employee elections to participate or to opt out \n     through their payroll systems. On occasion, employers might \n     need to address mistakes or misunderstandings regarding \n     employee payroll deductions and deposit directions. The time \n     and attention required of the employer could generally be \n     expected to be minimized through orderly communications, \n     written or electronic, between employees and employers, \n     facilitated by the use of standard forms that ``piggyback'' \n     on the existing IRS forms such as the W-4 used by individuals \n     to elect levels of income tax withholding.\n     Exemption for small and new employers\n       As discussed, the requirement to offer payroll deposit to \n     IRAs as a substitute for sponsoring a retirement plan would \n     not apply to the smallest firms (those with up to 10 \n     employees) or to firms that have not been in business for at \n     least two years. However, even small or new firms that are \n     exempted would be encouraged to offer payroll deposit through \n     the tax credit described earlier. (In addition, a possible \n     approach to implementation of this program would be to \n     require payroll deposit for the first year or two only by \n     non-plan sponsors that are above a slightly larger size. This \n     would try out the new system and could identify any ``bugs'' \n     or potential improvements before broader implementation.)\n       Employees of small employers that are exempted--like other \n     individuals who do not work for an employer that is part of \n     the payroll deposit system outlined here--would be able to \n     use other mechanisms to facilitate saving. These include the \n     ability to contribute by instructing the IRS to make a direct \n     deposit of a portion of an income tax refund, by setting up \n     an automatic debit arrangement for IRA contributions (perhaps \n     with the help of a professional or trade association), and by \n     other means discussed below.\n     Employee Participation\n       Like a 401(k) contribution, the amount elected by the \n     employee as a salary reduction contribution generally would \n     be tax-favored. It either would be a ``pre-tax'' contribution \n     to a traditional, tax-deductible IRA--deducted or excluded \n     from the employee's gross income for tax purposes--or a \n     contribution to a Roth IRA, which instead receives tax-\n     favored treatment upon distribution. An employee who did not \n     qualify to\n\n[[Page S10297]]\n\n     make a deductible IRA contribution or a Roth IRA contribution \n     (for example, because of income that exceeds the applicable \n     income eligibility thresholds), would be responsible for \n     making the appropriate adjustment on the employee's tax \n     return. The statute would specify which type of IRA is the \n     default, and the firm would have no responsibility for \n     ensuring that employees satisfied the applicable IRA \n     requirements.\n       It is often argued that a Roth IRA is the preferred \n     alternative for lowerincome individuals on the theory that \n     their marginal income tax rates are likely to increase as \n     they become more successful economically. The argument is \n     often made also that a Roth is preferable for many others on \n     the assumption that federal budget deficits will cause income \n     tax rates to rise in the future. On either of those \n     assumptions, all other things being equal, the Roth's tax \n     advantage for payouts would likely be more valuable than the \n     traditional IRA's tax deduction for contributions. In \n     addition, the Roth, by producing less taxable income in \n     retirement years, could avoid exposing the individual to a \n     higher rate of incomerelated tax on social security benefits \n     in retirement.\n       This point of view, however, may well overstate the \n     probability that our tax system, including the federal income \n     tax, social security taxes, and the tax treatment of the Roth \n     IRA, will continue essentially as it is. If, instead of \n     increasing marginal tax rates, we moved to a consumption or \n     value added tax or another system that exempts savings or \n     retirement savings from tax--or if a future Congress \n     eliminated or limited the Roth income tax (and social \n     security benefits tax) advantages--the choice of a Roth over \n     a deductible IRA would entail giving up the proverbial bird \n     in the hand for two in the bush.\n       Because the automatic IRA proposal would encourage but not \n     require individuals to save, the associated incentives for \n     saving are important. The instant gratification taxpayers can \n     obtain from a deductible IRA might do more to motivate many \n     households than the government's long-term promise of an \n     uncertain tax benefit in an uncertain future. (In addition, \n     by shifting the loss of tax revenues beyond the congressional \n     budget ``window'' period, the Roth also presents a special \n     challenge to a policy of fiscal responsibility.) Accordingly, \n     we are inclined to make the traditional IRA the default but \n     to allow individuals to elect payroll deposits to a Roth.\n     Employees covered\n       Employees eligible for payroll deposit savings might be, \n     for example, employees who have worked for the employer on a \n     regular basis (including parttime) for a specified period of \n     time and whose employment there is expected to continue. \n     Employers would not be required, however, to offer direct \n     deposit savings to employees they already cover under a \n     retirement plan, including employees eligible to contribute \n     (whether or not they actually do so) to a 401(k)-type salary-\n     reduction arrangement. Accordingly, as discussed, an employer \n     that limits retirement plan coverage to a portion of its \n     workforce generally would be required to offer direct deposit \n     or other payroll deduction saving to the rest of the \n     workforce.\n\n\n                           the automatic ira\n\n     Obstacles to participation\n       Even if employers were required to offer direct deposit to \n     IRAs, various impediments would prevent many eligible \n     employees from taking advantage of the opportunity. To save \n     in an IRA, individuals must make a variety of decisions and \n     must overcome inertia. At least five key questions are \n     involved in the process for employees:\n       a) whether to participate at all;\n       b) where (with which financial institution) to open an IRA \n     (or, if they have an IRA already, whether to use it or open a \n     new one);\n       c) whether the IRA should be a traditional or Roth IRA;\n       d) how much to contribute to the IRA; and\n       e) how to invest the IRA.\n       Once these decisions have been made, the individual must \n     still take the initiative to fill out the requisite paperwork \n     (whether on paper or electronically) to participate. Even in \n     401(k) plans, where decisions (b) and, unless the plan offers \n     a Roth 401(k) option, (c) are not required, millions of \n     employees are deterred from participating because of the \n     other three decisions or because they simply do not get \n     around to enrolling in the plan.\n     Overcoming the obstacles to participation: Encouraging \n         automatic enrollment\n       These obstacles can be overcome by making participation \n     easier and more automatic, in much the same way as is being \n     done increasingly in the 401(k) universe. An employee \n     eligible to participate in a 401(k) plan automatically has a \n     savings vehicle ready to receive the employee's contributions \n     (the plan sponsor sets up an account in the plan for each \n     participating employee) and benefits from a powerful \n     automatic savings mechanism in the form of regular payroll \n     deduction. With payroll deduction as the method of saving, \n     deposits continue to occur automatically and regularly--\n     without the need for any action by the employee--once the \n     employee has elected to participate. And finally, to jump-\n     start that initial election to participate, an increasing \n     percentage of 401(k) plan sponsors are using ``automatic \n     enrollment.''\n       Auto enrollment tends to work most effectively when it is \n     followed by gradual escalation of the initial contribution \n     rate. The automatic contribution rate can increase either on \n     a regular, scheduled basis, such as 4 percent in the first \n     year, 5 percent in the second year, etc., or in coordination \n     with future pay raises. But if the default mode is \n     participation in the plan (as it is under auto enrollment), \n     employees no longer need to overcome inertia and take the \n     initiative in order to save; saving happens automatically, \n     even if employees take no action.\n       Employers offering payroll deposit saving to an IRA should \n     be explicitly permitted to arrange for appropriate automatic \n     increases in the automatic IRA contribution rate. However, an \n     employer facilitating saving in an automatic IRA has far less \n     of an incentive to use automatic escalation (or to set the \n     initial automatic contribution rate as high as it thinks \n     employees will accept) than an employer sponsoring a 401(k) \n     plan. The 401(k) sponsor generally has a financial incentive \n     to encourage nonhighly compensated employees to contribute as \n     much as possible, because their average contribution level \n     determines how much highly compensated employees can \n     contribute under the 401(k) nondiscrimination standards. \n     Because no nondiscrimination standards apply to IRAs, \n     employers have no comparable incentive to maximize \n     participation and contributions to IRAs.\n       Automatic enrollment, which has typically been applied to \n     newly hired employees (as opposed to both new hires and \n     employees who have been with the employer for some years), \n     has produced dramatic increases in 401(k) participation. This \n     is especially true in the case of lower-income and minority \n     employees. In view of the basic similarities between employee \n     payroll-deduction saving in a 401(k) and under a direct \n     deposit IRA arrangement, the law should, at a minimum, \n     permit employers to automatically enroll employees in \n     direct deposit IRAs.\n       The conditions imposed by the Treasury Department on 401(k) \n     auto enrollment would apply to direct or payroll deposit IRA \n     auto enrollment as well: all potentially auto enrolled \n     employees must receive advance written notice (and annual \n     notice) regarding the terms and conditions of the saving \n     opportunity and the auto enrollment, including the procedure \n     for opting out, and all employees must be able to opt out at \n     any time.\n       It is not at all clear, however, whether simply allowing \n     employers to use auto enrollment with direct deposit IRAs \n     will prove to be effective. A key motivation for using auto \n     enrollment in 401(k) plans is to improve the plan's score \n     under the 401(k) nondiscrimination test by encouraging more \n     moderate- and lower-paid (``nonhighly compensated'') \n     employees to participate, which in turn increases the \n     permissible level of tax-preferred contributions for highly \n     compensated employees. This motivation is absent when the \n     employer is merely providing direct deposit IRAs, rather than \n     sponsoring a qualified plan such as a 401(k), because no \n     nondiscrimination standards apply unless there is a plan.\n       A second major motivation for using 401(k) auto enrollment \n     in many companies is management's sense of responsibility or \n     concern for employees and their retirement security. Many \n     executives involved in managing employee plans and benefits \n     have opted for auto enrollment because they believe far too \n     many employees are saving too little and investing unwisely \n     and need a strong push to ``do the right thing'' and take \n     advantage of the 401(k) plan. This motivation--by no means \n     present in all employers--is especially unlikely to be \n     driving an employer that merely permits payroll deposit to \n     IRAs without sponsoring a retirement plan.\n       Third, employers might have greater concern about potential \n     employee reaction to auto enrollment in the absence of an \n     employer matching contribution. The high return on employees' \n     investment delivered by the typical 401(k) match helps give \n     confidence to 401(k) sponsors using auto enrollment that they \n     are doing right by their employees and need not worry unduly \n     about potential complaints from workers who failed to read \n     the notice.\n       Finally, an employer concern that has made some plan \n     sponsors hesitate to use auto enrollment with 401(k) plans \n     might loom larger in the case of auto enrollment with direct \n     deposit IRAs. This is the concern about avoiding a possible \n     violation of state laws that prohibit deductions from \n     employee paychecks without the employee's advance written \n     authorization. Assuming most direct deposit IRA arrangements \n     are not employer plans governed by ERISA, such state laws, as \n     they apply to automatic IRAs, may not be preempted by ERISA \n     because they do not ``relate to any employee benefit plan.'' \n     For reasons such as these, without a meaningful change in the \n     law, most employers that are unwilling to offer a qualified \n     plan today are unlikely to take the initiative to \n     automatically enroll employees in direct deposit IRAs.\n     Not requiring employers to use automatic enrollment\n       One possible response would be to require employers to use \n     automatic enrollment in conjunction with the direct deposit \n     IRAs (while giving the employers a tax credit and legal \n     protections). The argument for such a requirement would be \n     that it would likely increase participation dramatically \n     while preserving employee choice (workers could always opt \n     out), and that, for the reasons summarized above, employers \n     that do not provide a qualified plan (or a match) are \n     unlikely to use auto enrollment voluntarily.\n\n[[Page S10298]]\n\n     The arguments against such a requirement include the concern \n     that a workforce that presumably has not shown sufficient \n     demand for a qualified retirement plan to induce the employer \n     to offer one might react unfavorably to being automatically \n     enrolled in direct deposit savings without a matching \n     contribution. (In addition, some small business owners who \n     have only a few employees and work with all of them on a \n     daily basis might take the view that automatic enrollment is \n     unnecessary because of the constant flow of communication \n     between the owner and each employee.)\n       It is noteworthy, however, that recent public opinion \n     polling shows strong support among registered voters for \n     making saving easier by making it automatic, with 71 percent \n     of respondents favoring a fully automatic 401(k), including \n     automatic enrollment, automatic investment, and automatic \n     contribution increases over time, with the opportunity to opt \n     out at any stage. A vast majority (85 percent) of voters said \n     that if they were automatically enrolled in a 401(k), they \n     would not opt out, even when given the opportunity to do so. \n     In addition, given the choice, 59 percent of respondents \n     preferred a workplace IRA with automatic enrollment to one \n     without.\n     Requiring explicit ``Up or Down'' employee elections while \n         encouraging auto enrollment\n       An alternative approach that has been used in 401(k) plans \n     and might be particularly well suited to payroll deposit \n     savings is to require all eligible employees to submit an \n     election that explicitly either accepts or declines direct \n     deposit to an IRA. Instead of treating employees who fail to \n     respond as either excluded or included, this ``up or down'' \n     election approach has no default. There is evidence \n     suggesting that requiring employees to elect one way or the \n     other can raise 401(k) participation nearly as much as auto \n     enrollment does. Requiring an explicit election picks up many \n     who would otherwise fail to participate because they do not \n     complete and return the enrollment form due to \n     procrastination, inertia, inability to decide on investments \n     or level of contribution, and the like.\n       Accordingly, a possible strategy for increasing \n     participation in payroll deposit IRAs would be to require \n     employers to obtain a written (including electronic) ``up or \n     down'' election from each eligible employee either accepting \n     or declining the direct deposit to an IRA. Under this \n     strategy, employers that voluntarily auto enroll their \n     employees in the direct deposit IRAs would be excused from \n     the requirement that they obtain an explicit election from \n     each employee because all employees who fail to elect would \n     be participating. This exemption--treating an employer's use \n     of auto enrollment as an alternative means of satisfying its \n     required-election obligation--would add an incentive for \n     employers to use auto enrollment without requiring them to \n     use it. Any firms that prefer not to use auto enrollment \n     would simply obtain a completed election from each employee, \n     either electronically or on a paper form. And either way--\n     whether the employer chose to use auto enrollment or the \n     required-election approach--participation would likely \n     increase significantly, perhaps even approaching the level \n     that might be achieved if auto enrollment were required for \n     all payroll deposit IRAs.\n       This combined strategy for promoting payroll deposit IRA \n     participation could be applied separately to new hires and \n     existing employees: thus, an employer auto enrolling new \n     hires would be exempted from obtaining completed elections \n     from all new hires (but not from existing employees), while \n     an employer auto enrolling both new hires and existing \n     employees would be excused from having to obtain elections \n     from both new hires and existing employees.\n       The required election would not obligate employers to \n     obtain a new election from each employee every year. Once an \n     employee submitted an election form, that employee would not \n     be required to make another election: as in most 401(k) \n     plans, the initial election would continue throughout the \n     year and from year to year unless and until the employee \n     chose to change it. Similarly, an employee who failed to \n     submit an election form and was auto enrolled by default in \n     the payroll deposit IRA would continue to be auto enrolled \n     unless and until the employee took action to make an explicit \n     election.\n       To maximize participation, employers would receive a \n     standard enrollment module reflecting current best practices \n     in enrollment procedures. A nationwide website with standard \n     forms would serve as a repository of state-of-the-art best \n     practices in and savings education. The use of automatic \n     enrollment (whereby employees automatically are enrolled at a \n     statutorily specified rate of contribution--such as 3% of \n     pay--unless they opt out) would be encouraged in two ways. \n     First, the standard materials provided to employers would be \n     framed so as to present auto enrollment as the presumptive or \n     perhaps even the default enrollment method, although \n     employers would be easily able to opt out in favor of simply \n     obtaining an ``up or down'' response from all employees. In \n     effect, such a ``double default'' approach would use the same \n     principle at both the employer and employee level by auto \n     enrolling employers into auto enrolling employees. Second, as \n     noted, employers using auto enrollment to promote \n     participation would not need to obtain responses from \n     unresponsive employees.\n     Compliance and enforcement\n       Employers' use of the required-election approach would also \n     help solve an additional problem--enforcing compliance with a \n     requirement that employers offer direct deposit savings. As a \n     practical matter, many employers might question whether the \n     IRS would ever really be able to monitor and enforce such a \n     requirement. Employers may believe that, if the IRS asked an \n     employer why none of its employees used direct deposit IRAs, \n     the employer could respond that it told its employees about \n     this option and they simply were not interested. However, if \n     employers that were required to offer direct deposit savings \n     had to obtain a signed election from each eligible employee \n     who declined the payroll deposit option, employers would know \n     that the IRS could audit their files for each employee's \n     election. This by itself would likely improve compliance.\n       In fact, a single paper or e-mail notice could advise the \n     employee of the opportunity to engage in payroll deduction \n     savings and elicit the employee's response. The notice and \n     the employee's election might be added or attached to IRS \n     Form W-4. (As noted, the W-4 is the form an employer \n     ordinarily obtains from new hires and often from other \n     employees to help the employer comply with its income tax--\n     withholding obligations.) If the employer chose to use auto \n     enrollment, the notice would also inform employees of that \n     feature (including the default contribution level and \n     investment and the procedure for opting out), and the \n     employer's records would need to show that employees who \n     failed to submit an election were in fact participating in \n     the payroll deduction savings.\n       Employers would be required to certify annually to the IRS \n     that they were in compliance with the payroll deposit savings \n     requirements. This might be done in conjunction with the \n     existing IRS Form W-3 that employers file annually to \n     transmit Forms W-2 to the government. Failure to offer \n     payroll deposit savings would ultimately need to be backed up \n     by an appropriate sanction, such as the threat of civil \n     monetary penalties or an excise tax.\n     Portability of savings\n       IRAs are inherently portable. Unlike a 401(k) or other \n     employer plan, an IRA survives and functions independently of \n     the individual saver's employment status. Thus the IRA owner \n     is not at risk of forfeiting or losing the account or \n     suffering an interruption in the ability to contribute when \n     changing or losing employment. As a broad generalization, the \n     automatic IRAs outlined here presumably would be freely \n     transferable to and with other IRAs and qualified plans that \n     permit such transfers. (However, as discussed below, the \n     investment limitations and other cost-containment features of \n     these IRAs raise the issue of whether transferability to \n     other types of vehicles should be subject to \n     restrictions.)\n\n\n                   making a savings vehicle available\n\n       Most current direct deposit arrangements use a payroll-\n     deduction savings mechanism similar to the 401(k), but, \n     unlike the 401(k), do not give the employee a ready-made \n     vehicle or account to receive deposits. The employee must \n     open a recipient account and must identify the account to the \n     employer. However, where the purpose of the direct deposit is \n     saving, it would be useful to many individuals who would \n     rather not choose a specific IRA to have a ready-made \n     fallback or default account available for the deposits.\n       Under this approach, modeled after the SIMPLE-IRA, which \n     currently covers an estimated 2 million employees, \n     individuals who wish to direct their contributions to a \n     specific IRA would do so. The employer would follow these \n     directions as employers ordinarily do when they make direct \n     deposits of paychecks to accounts specified by employees. At \n     the same time, the employer would also have the option of \n     simplifying its task by remitting all employee contributions \n     in the first instance to IRAs at a single private financial \n     institution that the employer designates. However, even in \n     this case, employees would be able to transfer the \n     contributions, without cost, from the employer's designated \n     financial institution to an IRA provider chosen by the \n     employee.\n       By designating a single IRA provider to receive all \n     contributions, the employer could avoid the potential \n     administrative hassles of directing deposits to a multitude \n     of different IRAs for different employees, while employees \n     would be free to transfer their contributions from the \n     employer's designated institution to an IRA provider of their \n     own choosing. Even this approach, though, still places a \n     burden on either the employer or the employee to choose an \n     IRA. For many small businesses, the choice might not be \n     obvious or simple. In addition, the market may not be very \n     robust because at least some of the major financial \n     institutions that provide IRAs may well not be interested in \n     selling new accounts that seem unlikely to grow enough to be \n     profitable within a reasonable time. Some of the major \n     financial firms appear to be motivated at least as much by a \n     desire to maximize the average account balance as by the goal \n     of maximizing aggregate assets under management. They \n     therefore may shun small accounts that seem to lack much \n     potential for rapid growth.\n       The current experience with automatic rollover IRAs is a \n     case in point. Firms are required to establish these IRAs as \n     a default vehicle for qualified plan participants whose \n     employment terminates with an account balance of not more \n     than $5,000 and who fail to provide any direction regarding \n     rollover or\n\n[[Page S10299]]\n\n     other payout. The objective is to reduce leakage of benefits \n     from the tax-favored retirement system by stopping \n     involuntary cashouts of account balances between $1,000 and \n     $5,000. (Plan sponsors continue to have the option to cash \n     out balances of up to $1,000 and to retain in the plan \n     account balances between $1,000 and $5,000 instead of rolling \n     them over to an IRA.) Because plan sponsors are required to \n     set up IRAs only for ``unresponsive'' participants--those who \n     fail to give instructions as to the disposition of their \n     benefits--these IRAs are presumed to be less likely than \n     other IRAs are to attract additional contributions. \n     Accordingly, significant segments of the IRA provider \n     industry have not been eager to cater to this segment of the \n     market. As a result, plan sponsors have tended to reduce \n     their cashout level from $5,000 to $1,000 so that new IRAs \n     would not have to be established.\n       For somewhat similar reasons, IRA providers might expect \n     payroll deposit IRAs to be less profitable than other \n     products. As a result, employers and employees might well \n     find that providers are not marketing to them aggressively \n     and that the array of payroll deposit IRA choices is \n     comparatively limited.\n       The prospect of tens of millions of personal retirement \n     accounts with relatively small balances likely to grow \n     relatively slowly suggests that the market may need to be \n     encouraged to develop widely available low-cost personal \n     accounts or IRAs. Otherwise, for ``small savers,'' fixed-cost \n     investment management and administrative fees may consume too \n     much of the earnings on the account and potentially even \n     erode principal.\n     A standard default account\n       Accordingly, to facilitate saving and minimize costs, we \n     believe that a strong case can be made for a default IRA that \n     would be automatically available to receive direct deposit \n     contributions without requiring either the employee or \n     employer to choose among IRA providers and without requiring \n     the employee to take the initiative to open an IRA. Under \n     this approach, for the convenience of both employees and \n     employers, those who wish to save but have no time or taste \n     for the process of locating and choosing an IRA would be able \n     to use a standard default, or automatic, account. If neither \n     the employer nor the employee designated a specific IRA \n     provider, the contributions would go to a personal retirement \n     account within a plan that would in some respects resemble \n     the federal Thrift Savings Plan (the 401(k)-type retirement \n     savings plan that covers federal government employees).\n       These standard default accounts would be maintained and \n     operated by private financial institutions under contract \n     with the federal government. To the fullest extent \n     practicable, the private sector would provide the investment \n     funds, investment management, record keeping, and related \n     administrative services. To serve as a default account for \n     direct deposits that have not been directed elsewhere by \n     employers or employees, an account need not be maintained by \n     a governmental entity. Given sufficient quality control and \n     adherence to reasonably uniform standards, various private \n     financial institutions could contract to provide the default \n     accounts, on a collective or individual institution basis, \n     more or less interchangeably--perhaps allocating customers on \n     a geographic basis or in accordance with other \n     arrangements based on providers' capacity. These fund \n     managers could be selected through competitive bidding. \n     Once individual default accounts reached a predetermined \n     balance (e.g., $15,000) sufficient to make them \n     potentially profitable for many private IRA providers, \n     account owners would have the option to transfer them to \n     IRAs of their choosing.\n     Cost containment\n       Both the direct deposit IRAs expressly selected by \n     employees and employers and the standardized direct deposit \n     IRAs that serve as default vehicles would be designed to \n     minimize the costs of investment management and account \n     administration. It should be feasible to realize substantial \n     cost savings through index funds, economies of scale in asset \n     management and administration, uniformity, and electronic \n     technologies.\n       In accordance with statutory guidelines for all direct \n     deposit IRAs, government contract specifications would call \n     for a no-frills approach to participant services in the \n     interest of minimizing costs. By contrast to the wide open \n     investment options provided in most current IRAs and the high \n     (and costlier) level of customer service provided in many \n     401(k) plans, the standard account would provide only a few \n     investment options (patterned after the Thrift Savings Plan, \n     if not more limited), would permit individuals to change \n     their investments only once or twice a year, and would \n     emphasize transparency of investment and other fees and other \n     expenses.\n       Specifically, costs of direct deposit IRAs might be reduced \n     by federal standards that, to the extent possible,\n       Exclude brokerage services and retail equity funds from the \n     investment options available under the IRA.\n       Limit the number of investment options under the IRA.\n       Allow individuals to change their investments only once or \n     twice per year.\n       Specify a low-cost default investment option and provide \n     that, if any of an individual's account balance is invested \n     in the default option, all of it must be.\n       Prohibit loans (IRAs do not allow them in any event) and \n     perhaps limit preretirement withdrawals.\n       Limit access to customer service call centers.\n       Preclude commissions.\n       Make compliance testing unnecessary.\n       Give account owners only a single account statement per \n     year (especially if daily valuation is built into the system \n     and is available to account owners).\n       Encourage the use of electronic and other new technologies \n     (including enrollment on a web site) for fund transfers, \n     record keeping, and communications among IRA providers, \n     participating employees, and employers to reduce paperwork \n     and cost. Electronic administration has considerable \n     potential to cut costs.\n       The availability to savers of a major low-cost personal \n     account alternative in the form of the standard account may \n     even help, through market competition, to drive down the \n     costs and fees of IRAs offered separately by private \n     financial institutions. Through efficiencies associated with \n     collective investment and greater uniformity, the standard \n     account should help move the system away from the retail-type \n     cost structure characteristic of current IRAs. It should also \n     help create a broad infrastructure of individual savings \n     accounts that would cover most of the working population.\n       In conjunction with these steps, Congress and the \n     regulators may be able to do more to require simplified, \n     uniform disclosure and description of IRA investment and \n     administrative fees and charges (building on previous work by \n     the Department of Labor relating to 401(k) fees). Such \n     disclosure should help consumers compare costs and thereby \n     promote healthy price competition.\n       Another approach would begin by recognizing the trade-off \n     between asset management costs and investment types. As a \n     broad generalization, asset management charges tend to be low \n     for money market funds, certificates of deposit, and certain \n     other relatively low-risk, lower-return investments that \n     generally do not require active management. However, it \n     appears that limiting individual accounts to these types of \n     investments would be unnecessarily restrictive. As discussed \n     below (under ``Default Investment Fund''), passively managed \n     index funds, such as those used in the Thrift Savings Plan, \n     are also relatively inexpensive.\n       A very different approach to cost containment would be to \n     impose a statutory or regulatory limitation on investment \n     management and administrative fees that providers could \n     charge. One example is the United Kingdom's limit on \n     permissible charges for management of ``stakeholder pension'' \n     accounts--an annual 150 basis point fee cap for five years \n     that is scheduled to drop to 100 basis points thereafter. As \n     another and more limited example, the U.S. Department of \n     Labor has imposed a kind of limitation on fees charged by \n     providers of automatic rollover IRAs established by employers \n     for terminating employees who fail to provide any direction \n     regarding the disposition of account balances of up to \n     $5,000. Labor regulations provide a fiduciary safe harbor \n     for auto rollover IRAs that preserve principal and that do \n     not charge fees greater than those charged by the IRA \n     provider for other IRAs it provides.\n       Presumably, a mandatory limit would give rise to potential \n     cross-subsidies from products that are free of any limit on \n     fees to the IRAs that are subject to the fee limit--a result \n     that could be viewed either as an inappropriate distortion or \n     as a necessary and appropriate allocation of resources. We \n     would view a mandatory limit as a last resort, preferring the \n     market-based strategies outlined above.\n     Default investment fund\n       Both the IRAs offered independently by private financial \n     institutions and explicitly selected by employees or \n     employers and the default IRAs would serve the important \n     purpose of providing low-cost professional asset management \n     to millions of individual savers, presumably improving their \n     aggregate investment results. To that end, all of these \n     accounts would offer a similar, limited set of investment \n     options, including a default investment fund in which \n     deposits would automatically be invested unless the \n     individual chose otherwise. This default investment would be \n     a highly diversified ``target asset allocation'' or ``life-\n     cycle'' fund comprised of a mix of equities and fixed income \n     or stable value investments, and probably relying heavily on \n     index funds. (The life-cycle funds recently introduced into \n     the federal Thrift Savings Plan are one possible model.) A \n     portion or all of the fixed income component could be \n     comprised of Treasury inflation protected securities \n     (``TIPS'') to protect against the risk of inflation.\n       The mix of equities and fixed income would be intended to \n     reflect the consensus of most personal investment advisers, \n     which emphasizes sound asset allocation and diversification \n     of investments--including exposure to equities (and perhaps \n     other assets that have higher-risk and higher-return \n     characteristics), at least given the foundation of retirement \n     income already delivered through Social Security and assuming \n     the funds will not shortly be needed for expenses. The use of \n     index funds would avoid the costs of active investment \n     management while promoting wide diversification.\n       This default investment would actually consist of several \n     different funds, depending on the individual's age, with the \n     more conservative investments (such as those relying\n\n[[Page S10300]]\n\n     more heavily on TIPS) applicable to older individuals who are \n     closer to the time when they might need to use the funds. \n     Individuals who selected the default fund or were defaulted \n     into it would have their account balances entirely invested \n     in that fund. However, they would be free to exit the fund at \n     specified times and opt for a different investment option \n     among those offered within the IRA.\n       The standard automatic (default) investment would also \n     serve two other key purposes. It would encourage employee \n     participation in direct deposit savings by enabling employees \n     who are satisfied with the default to simplify what may be \n     the most difficult decision they would otherwise be required \n     to make as a condition of participation (i.e., how to \n     invest). Finally, the standard default investment should \n     encourage more employers to use automatic enrollment (thereby \n     boosting employee participation) by saving them from having \n     to choose a default investment. This, in turn, would make it \n     easier to protect employers from responsibility for IRA \n     investments, especially employers using automatic enrollment \n     (as discussed below).\n       We would not fully specify the default investment by \n     statute. It is desirable to maintain a degree of flexibility \n     in order to reflect a consensus of expert financial advice \n     over time. Accordingly, general statutory guidelines would be \n     fleshed out at the administrative level after regular comment \n     by and consultation with private-sector investment experts.\n       An additional and major design issue is whether the \n     standard, limited set of investment options for payroll \n     deposit IRAs should be only a minimum set of options in each \n     IRA, so that the IRA provider would be permitted to provide \n     any additional options it wished. Limiting the IRAs to these \n     specified options would best serve the purposes of containing \n     costs, improving investment results for IRA owners in the \n     aggregate, and simplifying individuals' investment choices. \n     At the same time, such restrictions would constrain the \n     market, potentially limit innovation, and limit choice for \n     individuals who prefer other alternatives.\n       One of the ways to resolve this tradeoff would be to limit \n     direct deposit IRAs to the prescribed array of investment \n     options without imposing any comparable limits on other IRAs, \n     and to allow owners of direct deposit IRAs (including default \n     IRAs) to transfer or roll over their account balances between \n     the two classes of accounts. Under this approach, the owner \n     of a direct deposit IRA could transfer the account balance to \n     other (unrestricted) IRAs that are willing to accept such \n     transfers (but perhaps only after the account balance reaches \n     a specified amount that would no longer be unprofitable to \n     most IRA providers). While such a transfer to an unrestricted \n     IRA would deprive the owner of the cost-saving advantages of \n     the no-frills, limited-choice model, such a system would \n     still enable individuals to retain the efficiencies and cost \n     protection associated with the standard low-cost model if \n     they so choose.\n     Employers protected from any risk of fiduciary liability\n       Employers traditionally have been particularly concerned \n     about the risk of fiduciary liability associated with their \n     selection of retirement plan investments.\n       This concern extends to the employer's designation of \n     default investments that employees are free to decline in \n     favor of alternative investments. In the IRA universe, \n     employers transferring funds to automatic rollover IRAs and \n     employer-sponsored SIMPLE-IRAs retain a measure of fiduciary \n     responsibility for initial investments.\n       By contrast, under our proposal, employers making direct \n     deposits would be insulated from such potential liability. \n     These employers would have no liability or fiduciary \n     responsibility with respect to the manner in which direct \n     deposits are invested in default IRAs or in nondefault IRAs \n     (whether selected by the employer or the employee), nor would \n     employers be exposed to potential liability with respect to \n     any employee's choice of IRA provider or type of IRA. This \n     protection of employers is facilitated by statutory \n     designation of standard investment types that reduces the \n     need for continuous professional investment advice. To \n     protect workers against inappropriate IRA providers or \n     inappropriate employer selection of IRA providers while \n     continuing to insulate employers from fiduciary \n     responsibility, employers could be precluded from imposing a \n     particular IRA provider on its employees other than the \n     government-contracted default IRA or could be constrained to \n     choose among an approved list of providers based on capital \n     adequacy, soundness, and other criteria.\n     Public opinion polling\n       Recent public opinion polling has shown overwhelming \n     support for payroll deduction direct deposit saving. Among \n     registered voters surveyed, 83 percent of respondents said \n     they would be agreeable to having their employer offer to \n     sign them up for an IRA and allow them to contribute to it \n     through direct deposit of a small amount from their paycheck \n     to help them save for retirement. Similarly, 79 percent of \n     registered voters expressed support (and 54 percent expressed \n     ``strong'' support) for giving taxpayers the option to have \n     part of their income tax refund deposited into a retirement \n     savings account such as an IRA by just checking a box on \n     their tax return.\n       In addition, the polling shows very strong support for a \n     requirement that goes far beyond our proposal, that every \n     company offer its employees some kind of retirement plan--\n     such as a pension or 401(k), or at least an IRA to which \n     employees could contribute. Among registered voters surveyed \n     in August 2005, 77 percent supported such a requirement (and \n     59 percent responded that they were ``strongly'' in support). \n     As discussed, the approach described in this paper would not \n     require employers to offer their employees retirement plans, \n     but would give firms a financial incentive to offer their \n     employees access to payroll deduction as a convenient and \n     easy means of saving, and would require firms above a certain \n     size and maturity to extend this offer to their employees.\n\n\n              the importance of protecting employer plans\n\n       Employer-sponsored pension, profit-sharing, 401(k), and \n     other plans can be particularly effective--more so than \n     IRAs--in accumulating benefits for employees. As noted \n     earlier, the participation rate in 401(k)s, for example, \n     tends to range from two thirds to three quarters of eligible \n     employees, in contrast to IRAs, in which fewer than 1 in \n     10 eligible individuals participates. Employer plans tend \n     to be far more effective than IRAs at providing coverage \n     because of a number of attributes: for one thing, pension \n     and profit-sharing plans, for example, are funded by \n     employer contributions that automatically are made for the \n     benefit of eligible employees without requiring the \n     employee to take any initiative in order to participate. \n     Second, essentially all tax-qualified employer plans must \n     abide by standards that either seek to require reasonably \n     proportionate coverage of rank and-file workers or give \n     the employer a distinct incentive to encourage widespread \n     participation by employees. This encouragement typically \n     takes the form of both employer-provided retirement \n     savings education efforts and employer matching \n     contributions. The result is that the naturally eager \n     savers, who tend to be in the higher tax brackets, tend to \n     subsidize or bring along the naturally reluctant savers, \n     who often are in the lowest (including zero) tax brackets.\n       Employer-sponsored retirement plans also have other \n     features that tend to make them effective in providing or \n     promoting coverage. As noted, the proposal outlined here \n     seeks to transplant some of these features to the IRA \n     universe. These include the automatic availability of a \n     saving vehicle, the use of payroll deduction (which continues \n     automatically once initiated), matching contributions \n     (further discussed below), professional investment \n     management, and peer group reinforcement of saving behavior.\n       The automatic IRA must thus be designed carefully to avoid \n     competing with or crowding out employer plans and to avoid \n     encouraging firms to drop or reduce the employer \n     contributions that many make to plan participants. Owners and \n     others who control the decision whether to adopt or continue \n     maintaining a retirement plan for employees should continue \n     to have incentives to sponsor such plans. The ability to \n     offer employees direct deposit to IRAs should be designed so \n     that it will not prompt employers to drop, curtail, or \n     refrain from adopting retirement plans.\n       Probably the single most important protection for employer \n     plans is to set maximum permitted contribution levels to the \n     automatic IRA so that they will be sufficient to meet the \n     demand for savings by most households but not high enough to \n     satisfy the appetite for tax-favored saving of business \n     owners or decision-makers. The average annual contribution to \n     a 401(k) plan by a nonhighly compensated employee is somewhat \n     greater than $2,000, and average annual 401(k) contributions \n     by employees generally tend to be on the order of 7 percent \n     of pay. A $3,000 contribution is 7.5 percent of pay for a \n     family earning $40,000, and 6 percent of pay for a family \n     earning $50,000.\n       Yet IRA contribution limits are already higher than these \n     contribution levels. IRAs currently allow a married couple to \n     contribute up to $8,000 ($4,000 each) on a tax-favored basis, \n     and an additional $1,000 ($500 each) if they are age 50 or \n     older. By 2008, these figures are scheduled to rise to \n     $10,000 plus $2,000 ($1,000 each) for those age 50 or older. \n     These amounts--the current $9,000 a year for those age 50 and \n     over ($8,000 for others) and the post-2007 $12,000 annual \n     amount for those age 50 and over ($10,000 for others)--may \n     well be enough to satisfy the desire of many small-business \n     owners for tax-favored retirement savings. Even some small-\n     business owners that might consider saving somewhat more than \n     $10,000 or $12,000 per year might well conclude that they are \n     better off not incurring the cost of making contributions and \n     providing a plan for their employees because the net benefit \n     to them of having a plan for employees is not greater than \n     the net benefit of simply saving through IRAs and giving \n     their employees access to IRAs.\n       Accordingly, at the most, payroll deposit IRAs should not \n     permit contributions above the current IRA dollar limits, and \n     could be limited to a lower amount such as $3,000. (A 3% of \n     pay contribution would remain below $3,000 for employees \n     whose compensation did not exceed $100,000.) Imposing a lower \n     limit on the payroll deduction IRA would reduce to some \n     degree the risk that employees will exceed the maximum IRA \n     dollar contribution limit because of auto enrollment, \n     combined with possible other contributions to an IRA. That is \n     already a risk under current\n\n[[Page S10301]]\n\n     law, but the automatic nature of auto enrollment increases \n     the risk, especially if auto escalation is implemented. There \n     is a tradeoff between the desirability of limiting the \n     contribution amount (to mitigate both this risk and the risk \n     of competing with employer plans) and the simplicity of using \n     an existing vehicle (the IRA) ``as is''.\n       In any event, the employee--not the employer--would be \n     responsible for monitoring any of all of their IRA \n     contributions to comply with the maximum limit (in part \n     because employees can contribute on their own and through \n     multiple employers). The ultimate reconciliation would be \n     made by the individual when filing the federal income tax \n     return.\n       In addition, the automatic IRA should be designed to avoid \n     reducing ordinary employees' incentives to contribute to \n     employer-sponsored plans such as 401(k)s. If workers perceive \n     a program such as direct deposit savings to IRAs as a more \n     attractive destination for their contributions than an \n     employer-sponsored plan (for example, because of better \n     matching, tax treatment, investment options, or liquidity), \n     it could unfortunately divert employee contributions from \n     employer plans. This in turn could have a destabilizing \n     effect by making it difficult for employers to meet the \n     nondiscrimination standards applicable to 401(k)s and other \n     plans and therefore potentially discouraging employers from \n     continuing the plans or their contributions. While a detailed \n     discussion of these points is beyond the scope of this paper, \n     it is important to maintain a relationship between IRAs and \n     employer-sponsored retirement plans that preserves and \n     protects the employer plans.\n     Automatic payroll deduction can promote marketing and \n         adoption of employer plans\n       Our approach is designed not only to avoid causing any \n     reduction or contraction of employer plans, but actually to \n     promote expansion of employer plans. Consultants, third-party \n     administrators, financial institutions, and other plan \n     providers could be expected to view this proposal as \n     providing a valuable new opportunity to market 401(k)s, \n     SIMPLE-IRAs and other tax-favored retirement plans to \n     employers. Firms that, under this proposal, were about to \n     begin offering their employees payroll deduction saving or \n     had been offering their employees payroll deduction saving \n     for a year or two could be encouraged to ``trade up'' to an \n     actual plan such as a 401(k) or SIMPLE-IRA.\n       Especially because these plans can now be purchased at very \n     low cost, it would seem natural for many small businesses to \n     graduate from payroll deduction savings and complete the \n     journey to a qualified plan in order to obtain the added \n     benefits in terms of recruitment, employee relations, and \n     larger tax-favored saving opportunities for owners and \n     managers.\n       The following compares the maximum annual tax-favored \n     contribution levels for IRAs, SIMPLE-IRA plans and 401(k) \n     plans in effect for 2006:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                     IRA         SIMPLE-IRA     401(k)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nUnder age 50.................  $4,000 per           $10,000      $15,000\n                                spouse ($5,000\n                                after 2007).\nAge 50 and above.............  $4,500 per           $12,000      $20,000\n                                spouse ($6,000\n                                after 2007).\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       In addition, as noted, small employers that adopt a new \n     plan for the first time are entitled to a tax credit of up to \n     $500 each year for three years. As discussed, the proposed \n     tax credit for offering payroll deposit would be smaller, so \n     as to maintain the incentive for employers to go beyond the \n     payroll deduction or direct deposit IRA and adopt an actual \n     plan such as a SIMPLE, 401(k), or other employer plan.\n\n\n               Encouraging Contributions by Nonemployees\n\n       The payroll deposit system outlined thus far would not \n     automatically cover self-employed individuals, employees of \n     the smallest or newest businesses that are exempt from any \n     payroll deposit obligation, or certain unemployed individuals \n     who can save. A strategy centered on automatic arrangements \n     can also make it easier for these people to contribute to \n     IRAs.\n     Encouraging automatic debit arrangements\n       For individuals who are not employees or who otherwise lack \n     access to payroll deduction, automatic debit arrangements can \n     serve as a counterpart to automatic payroll deduction. \n     Automatic debit enables individuals to spread payments out \n     over time and to make payments on a regular and timely basis \n     by having them automatically charged to and deducted from an \n     account--such as a checking or savings account or credit \n     card--at regular intervals on a set schedule. The individual \n     generally gives advance authorization to the payer that \n     manages the account or the recipient of the payment, or both. \n     The key is that, as in the case of payroll deduction, once \n     the initial authorization has been given, regular payments \n     continue without requiring further initiative on the part of \n     the individual. For many consumers, automatic debit is a \n     convenient way to pay bills or make payments on mortgages or \n     other loans without having to remember to make each payment \n     when due and without having to write and mail checks.\n       Similarly, as an element of an automatic IRA strategy, \n     automatic debit can facilitate saving while reducing \n     paperwork and cutting costs. For example, households can be \n     encouraged to sign up on-line for regular automatic debits to \n     a checking account or credit card that are directed to an IRA \n     or other saving vehicle. With on-line sign-up and monitoring, \n     steps can be taken to familiarize more households with \n     automatic debit arrangements and, via Internet websites and \n     otherwise, to make those arrangements easier to set up and \n     use as a mechanism for saving in IRAs.\n     Facilitating automatic debit iras through professional or \n         trade associations\n       Professional and trade associations could facilitate the \n     establishment of IRAs and the use of automatic debit and \n     direct deposit to the IRAs. Independent contractors and other \n     individuals who do not have an employer often belong to such \n     an association. The association, for example, might be able \n     to make saving easier for those members who wish to save by \n     making available convenient arrangements for automatic debit \n     of members' accounts. Association websites can make it easy \n     for members to sign up on line, monitor the automatic debit \n     savings, and make changes promptly when they wish to. \n     Although such associations generally lack the payroll-\n     deduction mechanism that is available to employers, they can \n     help their members set up a pipeline involving regular \n     automatic deposits (online or by traditional means) from \n     their personal bank or other financial accounts to an IRA \n     established for them.\n     Facilitating direct deposit of income tax refunds to IRAs\n       Another major element of a strategy to encourage \n     contributions outside of employment would be to allow \n     taxpayers to deposit a portion of their income tax refunds \n     directly into an IRA by simply checking a box on their tax \n     returns.\n       Currently, the IRS allows direct deposits of refunds to be \n     made to only one account. This all-or-nothing approach \n     discourages many households from saving any of the refund \n     because at least a portion of the refund is often needed for \n     immediate expenses. Allowing households instead to split \n     their refunds to deposit a portion directly into an IRA could \n     make saving simpler and, thus, more likely.\n       The Bush administration has supported divisible refunds in \n     its last three budget documents; however, the necessary \n     administrative changes have yet to be implemented. Since \n     federal income tax refunds total nearly $230 billion a year \n     (more than twice the estimated annual aggregate amount of net \n     personal savings in the United States), even a modest \n     increase in the proportion of refunds saved every year could \n     bring about a significant increase in savings.\n     Extending direct deposit to independent contractors\n       Millions of Americans are self-employed as independent \n     contractors. Many of these workers receive regular payments \n     from firms, but because they are not employees, they are not \n     subject to income tax or payroll tax withholding. These \n     individuals might be included in the direct deposit system by \n     giving them the right to request that the firm receiving \n     their services direct deposit into an IRA a specified portion \n     from the compensation that would otherwise be paid to them.\n       Compared to writing a large check to an IRA once a year, \n     this approach has several potential advantages to independent \n     contractors, which might well encourage them to save. These \n     include the ability to commit themselves to save a portion of \n     their compensation before they receive it (which, for some \n     people, makes the decision to defer consumption easier); the \n     ability to avoid having to make an affirmative choice among \n     various IRA providers; remittance of the funds by the firm by \n     direct deposit to the IRA; and, where payments are made to \n     the independent contractor on a regular basis, an arrangement \n     that, like regular payroll with holdings for employees, \n     automatically continues the pattern of saving through \n     repeated automatic payroll deductions unless and until the \n     individual elects to change.\n       In many cases, the independent service provider will not \n     have a sufficient connection to a firm that receives the \n     services, or both the independent contractor and the firm \n     will be unwilling to enter into a payroll deposit type of \n     arrangement. In such instances, the independent contractor \n     could contribute to an IRA using automatic debit (as \n     discussed above) or by sending together with the estimated \n     taxes that generally are due four times a year.\n     Matching deposits as a financial incentive\n       A powerful financial incentive for direct deposit saving by \n     those who are not in the higher tax brackets (and who \n     therefore derive little benefit from a tax deduction or \n     exclusion) would be a matching deposit to their direct \n     deposit IRA. One means of delivering such a matching deposit \n     would be via the bank, mutual fund, insurance carrier, \n     brokerage firm, or other financial institution that provides \n     the direct deposit IRA. For example, the first $500 \n     contributed to an IRA by an individual who is eligible to \n     make deductible contributions to an IRA might be\n\n[[Page S10302]]\n\n     matched by the private IRA provider on a dollar-for-dollar \n     basis, and the next $1,000 of contributions might be matched \n     at the rate of 50 cents on the dollar. The financial provider \n     would be reimbursed for its matching contributions through \n     federal income tax credits.\n       Recent evidence from a randomized experiment involving \n     matched contributions to IRAs suggests that a simple matching \n     deposit to an IRA can make individuals significantly more \n     likely to contribute and more likely to contribute larger \n     amounts.\n       Matching contributions--similar to those provided by most \n     401(k) plan sponsors--not only would help induce individuals \n     to contribute directly from their own pay, but also, if the \n     match were automatically deposited in the IRA, would add to \n     the amount saved in the IRA. The use of matching deposits, \n     however, would make it necessary to implement procedures \n     designed to prevent gaming--contributing to induce the \n     matching deposit, then quickly withdrawing those \n     contributions to retain the use of those funds. Among the \n     possible approaches would be to place matching deposits in a \n     separate subaccount subject to tight withdrawal rules and to \n     impose a financial penalty on early withdrawals of matched \n     contributions.\n       American households have a compelling need to increase \n     their personal saving, especially for long-term needs such as \n     retirement. This paper proposes a strategy that would seek to \n     make saving more automatic--hence easier, more convenient, \n     and more likely to occur--largely by adapting to the IRA \n     universe practices and arrangements that have proven \n     successful in promoting 401(k) participation. In our view, \n     the automatic IRA approach outlined here holds considerable \n     promise of expanding retirement savings for millions of \n     workers.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues Senators \nSmith, Conrad, and Bingaman in introducing the Women's Retirement \nSecurity Act of 2006. This legislation comes on the heels of the \npassage of the Pension Protection Act of 2006, which makes improvements \nto the defined benefit pension plan system.\n  The legislation that we are introducing today builds upon that \nlegislation and focuses on defined contribution plans. Our pension \nsystem has shifted away from defined benefit plans to defined \ncontribution plans. We should make it easier for employers to offer \ndefined contribution plans and for individuals to participate in these \nplans.\n  At a time when we have a negative savings rate that is the lowest \nsince the Great Depression, we should provide appropriate incentives to \nhelp individuals save for retirement. In an effort to achieve this, the \nWomen's Retirement Security Act of 2006 focuses on increasing \nretirement savings, the preservation of income, equity in divorce, \nimproving financial literacy, and encouraging small businesses to enter \nand remain in the employer retirement plan system.\n  This legislation increases savings by allowing employees to \ncontribute a portion of their paycheck to an individual retirement \naccount (IRA) if their employer does not offer a pension plan. \nAutomatic IRAs will help the 71 million workers that do not have \nemployer-sponsored plans. It is a low-cost, sensible solution that \nprovides a stepping stone toward employer-sponsored retirement plans. \nMore workers are likely to contribute to an IRA if the contribution is \ndeducted from their payroll. Automatic IRAs will help combat the \ninertia that is a factor in our low savings rate. The bill also \nprovides a tax credit to help small businesses with the cost of \nimplementation.\n  Women are often placed at a disadvantage in our retirement system \nbecause they cycle in and out of the work force. The Women's Retirement \nSecurity Act of 2006 addresses this issue by requiring employers that \noffer defined contribution plans to cover part-time employees that meet \nspecific requirements.\n  Pension coverage needs to improve, particularly for small businesses. \nIn 2004, only 26 percent of workers at firms with fewer than 25 \nemployees participated in pension plans. Progress has been made on \nproviding coverage to small businesses. Currently, more than 19 million \nworkers are covered by small business retirement plans, but more than \n36 million Americans work for firms with less than 25 employees.\n  The Women's Retirement Security Act of 2006 provides a start-up \ncredit for new small business retirement contributions. In addition, it \nremoves rules that discourage small employers from adopting deferral \nonly plans.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY:\n  S. 3953. A bill to foster development of minority-owned small \nbusinesses; to the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Minority \nEntrepreneurship Development Act of 2006. It's especially appropriate \nthat this bill be introduced during Hispanic Heritage Month. Millions \nof Latino Americans during this time reflect on their place in this \ncountry and the positive contributions they have made here. One area \nwhere we can be certain that the Hispanic community has made a \nsignificant contribution is in business. The principled and strong \nleadership of Hispanic Americans can be seen in corporate boards and \nsole proprietorships alike. As a Nation, we must support the \ndevelopment of the next generation of business leaders within the \nLatino community. I believe that this legislation will help in that \neffort.\n  This legislation is aimed at giving potential and burgeoning \nentrepreneurs the tools they need to realize their goals. Whether those \ngoals include creating a small business that will employ people from \nthe community or taking a small business and making it into a major \nenterprise, it's imperative that we develop the tools to help minority \nsmall business owners succeed.\n  I want to take a moment and tell you why it's so important to expand \nthe numbers of entrepreneurs in the minority community. As the Ranking \nMember on the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, \nI have received firsthand testimony and countless reports documenting \nthe positive economic impact that occurs when we foster \nentrepreneurship in underserved communities. There are signs of \nsignificant economic returns when minority businesses are created and \nare able to grow in size and capacity. Between 1987 and 1997, revenue \nfrom minority owned firms rose by 22.5 percent, an increase equivalent \nto an annual growth rate of 10 percent. Employment opportunities within \nminority owned firms increased by 23 percent during that same period. \nThere is a clear correlation between the growth of minority owned firms \nand the economic viability of the minority community.\n  Although, these economic numbers tell a significant part of the \nstory, they don't tell the whole story of what these firms mean to the \nminority communities they serve and represent. Many of these business \nleaders are first generation immigrants; many are first generation \nbusiness owners and many represent, for those in their communities, \nwhat hard work, determination and patience can do.\n  We must encourage those kinds of values in our minority communities \nand, quite frankly, in our nation as a whole. For generations, millions \nhave come to our shores in search of a better life. Millions of others \nwere brought here by force and for years were not given a voice in how \ntheir lives would turn out. But how ever we got here, we all have \nbecome branches of this great tree we call America. This tree is still \nnourished by roots planted by our forefathers more than 200 years ago. \nThose men and women planted the roots of hard work, innovation, faith \nand risk taking.\n  When you think about it, those words are the perfect description of \nan entrepreneur. It is the spirit of entrepreneurship that has made our \nnation great. And that is why it is absolutely imperative that we \ncontinue to support and develop that spirit in our minority \ncommunities. To that end, this legislation provides several tools to \nhelp minority entrepreneurs as they develop and grow their businesses.\n  First, this legislation will create an Office of Minority Small \nBusiness Development. One of its primary functions will be to increase \nthe number of small business loans that minority businesses receive. \nLatinos, African-Americans, Asian-Americans and women have been \nreceiving far fewer small business loans than they reasonably should.\n  To ensure that this trend is reversed and minorities begin to get a \ngreater share of loan dollars, venture capital investments, counseling, \nand contracting opportunities, this bill will give the new office the \nauthority to monitor the outcomes for programs under Capital Access, \nEntrepreneurial Development, and Government Contracting. It also \nrequires the head of\n\n[[Page S10303]]\n\nthe Office to work with SBA's partners, trade associations and business \ngroups to identify more effective ways to market to minority business \nowners, and to work with the head of Field Operations to ensure that \ndistrict offices have staff and resources to market to minorities.\n  Second, this legislation will create the Minority Entrepreneurship \nand Innovation Pilot Program. This program will offer a competitive \ngrant to Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Tribal Colleges, \nand Hispanic-Serving Institutions to create an entrepreneurship \ncurriculum at these institutions and to open Small Business Development \nCenters on campus to serve local businesses.\n  The goal of this program is to target students in highly skilled \nfields such as engineering, manufacturing, science and technology, and \nguide them towards entrepreneurship as a career option. Traditionally, \nminority-owned businesses are disproportionately represented in the \nservice sectors. Promoting entrepreneurial education to undergraduate \nstudents will help expand business ownership beyond the service sectors \nto higher yielding technical and financial sectors.\n  Third, this legislation will create the Minority Access to \nInformation Distance Learning Pilot Program. This program will offer \ncompetitive grants to well established national minority non-profit and \nbusiness organizations to create distance learning programs for small \nbusiness owners who are interested in doing business with the federal \ngovernment.\n  The goal of this program is to provide low cost training to the many \nsmall business owners who cannot afford to pay a consultant thousands \nof dollars for advice or training on how to prepare themselves to \ncontract with the federal government. There are thousands of small \nbusinesses in this country that are excellent and efficient. They are \nprimed to provide the goods and services that this nation needs to stay \ncompetitive. This program will help prepare them to do just that.\n  Finally, this legislation will extend the Socially and Economically \nDisadvantaged Business Program which expired in 2003. This program \nprovides a Price Evaluation Adjustment for Socially and Economically \nDisadvantaged businesses as a way of increasing their competitiveness \nwhen bidding against larger firms. This is one more tool to increase \nopportunities for our minority small business owners.\n  I have outlined several ways that we can create a more positive \nenvironment for our minority small business community. These are \nreasonable steps that we ought to take without delay. Moreover, these \nare important steps that will help bolster a movement that is already \nunderway. According to U.S. Census data, Hispanics are opening \nbusinesses 3 times faster than the national average. Also, business \ndevelopment and entrepreneurship have played a significant role in the \nexpansion of the black middle class in this country for over a century. \nThese business owners are embodying the entrepreneurial spirit that our \nforefathers carried with them as they established this nation.\n  With this legislation, we will help to extend that spirit to the next \ngeneration. Not only is this vital for our minority communities, but it \nis vital for America. I urge my colleagues to join with me in support \nof the Minority Entrepreneurship Development Act of 2006.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself and Mr. Menendez):\n  S. 3954. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nrequire monthly reporting regarding the number of individuals who have \nfallen into the part D donut hole and the amount such individuals are \nspending on covered part D drugs while in the donut hole; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, more and more seniors are waking each day \nand learning they've fallen into the dreaded ``donut hole''--the gap in \nprescription drug coverage that leaves them with large drug costs to \npay by themselves until coverage resumes. As a result, millions of \nseniors can't afford the drugs they urgently need, even though they're \npaying for Medicare coverage.\n  It's important to have a full accounting of how many seniors are \naffected, so that Congress and the public can make sensible choices \nabout Medicare. Senator Menendez and I intend to introduce legislation \nto require Medicare to track and publicly report how many enrollees \nfall into the donut hole, and how much they are spending themselves for \ntheir needed prescriptions.\n  We wouldn't be facing this problem if the administration and the \nRepublican Congress had cared more about seniors than about drug \nindustry profits when Medicare prescription drug coverage was enacted. \nThey refused to let Medicare negotiate drug prices, which the Veterans \nAdministration is allowed to do for veterans. Instead of allocating \nadequate Federal funds to the drug benefit, they made sure that HMOs \nreceived large overpayments, which enable them to force Medicare \nbeneficiaries into their plans by offering extra benefits, while still \nallowing the plans to make large profits.\n  It's long past time to correct this glaring defect in Medicare drug \ncoverage. Once we have up-to-date information on the damage being done \nby the donut hole, we can correct the problem and give seniors the \nMedicare coverage they deserve.\n  I ask by unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3954\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to create a grant program for collaboration programs \nthat ensure coordination among criminal justice agencies, adult \nprotective service agencies, victim assistance programs, and other \nagencies or organizations providing services to individuals with \ndisabilities in the investigation and response to abuse of or crimes \ncommitted against such individuals; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, it is a well-known fact that people with \ndisabilities face a great risk of abuse and victimization--in fact, \nstudies indicate that disabled adults experience violence or abuse at \nleast twice as often as those without disabilities. This shameful \nsituation is made even worse by the fact that far too often these \ncrimes are not reported, or if they are reported, they are not \neffectively prosecuted--with the result that crime victims with \ndisabilities are left vulnerable to further victimization. This is a \ntragic situation and one which requires action.\n  The good news is that we have a model to follow, a response which \nworks. Massachusetts has set up an excellent program to enhance \ncooperation and coordination between law enforcement and the State \nofficials and programs which provide services and care to the disabled, \nand this coordination has greatly improved the ability of the criminal \njustice system to prosecute these offenders and protect those with \ndisabilities from crime. In fact, since the implementation of the \nprogram, criminal referrals in these types of cases in Massachusetts \nwent up from 32 before the program began to 880 in 2004, the most \nrecent year for which we have statistics.\n  We should try to extend the success of the Massachusetts program \naround the country. Accordingly, today I am introducing the Crime \nVictims with Disabilities Act of 2006. This legislation would establish \na $10 million Federal grant program to make money available to States \nand localities which are\n\n[[Page S10304]]\n\ninterested in setting up similar programs to enhance training, \ncoordination, and cooperation within the law enforcement and \ndisabilities services communities order to address this problem.\n  The legislation would require a State or local government to design a \ncooperative plan to improve the reporting and prosecution of crimes \nagainst people with disabilities, including within the system at least \none criminal justice agency and at least one agency or organization \nwhich provides services to individuals with disabilities. The \nlegislation encourages local innovation; as long as the application \nmeets the basic goals of protecting people with disabilities from crime \nand prosecuting those who attempt to victimize them, it can be designed \nin whatever way the applicants decide will work best in the affected \ncommunity. The grants would be for a maximum of $300,000 over 2 years, \nwith a potential for a one-time renewal.\n  I have worked closely with the creators of the Massachusetts program \nand many others who work in law enforcement and who provide services to \ncrime victims and people with disabilities, and I believe this \nlegislation will help States and localities create programs that can \naddress the problem of violence against people with disabilities. This \nis a serious problem, and I encourage my colleagues to support this \neffort to help address it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INHOFE:\n  S. 3957. A bill to protect freedom of speech exercisable by houses of \nworship or mediation and affiliated organizations; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nwhich will protect the Constitutionally-guaranteed exercise of free \nspeech and exercise of religion, the Religious Freedom Act of 2006.\n  The American people may be surprised to learn a few things about \ntheir government's relationship with religion. They may be surprised to \nlearn that the Federal Government of the United States of America, in \nthe land of the free, does not allow religious leaders in houses of \nworship of all religious orders to say anything that might be construed \nas political in nature. The American people may further be surprised to \nlearn that the federal agency tasked with enforcing the absolute ban on \npolitical speech for houses of worship is the Internal Revenue Service. \nIt is the IRS that reviews the content of sermons and homilies and \nthreatens to revoke those institutions' tax-exempt status if they dare \nto speak out on the political matters of the day. Many times, the only \nevidence on which the IRS will base their case is a third-party \ncomplaint and may move forward with threatening letters and the \nrevocation of their tax-exempt status even if the prohibited \nactivities--the exercise of their First Amendment Rights--were \nincidental or unintentional. Furthermore, the IRS admits that it \napplies a ``coded language'' policy to political speech. That is, \ndiscussion of a moral issue, if it happens to be a matter discussed in \nour public debates, is a political issue and is consequently banned by \nthe IRS. The American people may even be more surprised to learn that \nthe IRS is stepping up the enforcement of the ban on political speech \nin houses of worship and has recently emphasized the ``coded language'' \npolicy.\n  A skeptic might assert that something as serious as an IRS-enforced \nban on political discourse in a church must have a tenured legislative \nhistory buttressed by decades of sound First Amendment jurisprudence. \nThe American people may be surprised to learn that the exact opposite \nis true. The First Amendment freedoms of houses of worship were \nstripped away in 1954 by the ``Johnson Amendment,'' a floor amendment \nnamed for then-Senator Lyndon Johnson, which placed an absolute ban on \npolitical speech by tax exempt organizations. Although the legislative \nrecord is relatively silent on this matter, the amendment and its \nsubsequent ban were enacted without a hearing, any debate, or any \npublic comment. History also indicates that Senator Johnson enacted \nthis ban as a means of silencing some anticommunist nonprofits that \nwere mobilizing against his political campaign. It now silences \nimportant comment on the issues of the day. Although the Supreme Court \nhas affirmed and reaffirmed a ``profound national commitment'' to the \nproposition that debate on issues should be ``uninhibited, robust, and \nwide-open,'' the debate has been unconstitutionally restricted for \nnearly 50 years.\n  Whereas the legislative history of the Johnson Amendment is dubious \nwhere it even exists, the history of the relationship between politics \nand the pulpit is a history of a positive force for change in momentous \ntimes in our history when we as a nation have reaffirmed our commitment \nto an open and tolerant society. From slavery to segregation, religious \nleaders in America clearly have been effective forces for good, and \nthey are also for more modern issues such as abortion, assisted \nsuicide, and human trafficking. Perhaps no one could better articulate \nan important aspect of the history of politics and the pulpit than \nMartin Luther King, Jr.: ``The church must be reminded that it is not \nthe master or the servant of the state, but rather the conscience of \nthe state. It must be the guide and the critic of the state, and never \nits tool . . . [or] it will become an irrelevant social club without \nmoral or spiritual authority.'' The Johnson Amendment silences the \n``conscience of the state.'' It's difficult to see how religious \nleaders can in any way continue to function as Martin Luther King Jr.'s \nideal of the church as the ``conscience of the state,'' as the church \nhas done so effectively during trying times for our state, when houses \nof worship are banned absolutely from discussing matters of the state.\n\n  The moral questions of the day are more often than not also \nfundamental social and political questions--questions that concern what \nwe value as a nation. It is truly astounding that today, in America, \nreligious leaders are banned from any comment on those moral issues. It \nis not partisan; this ban on speech makes no distinction between the \nideological divide of left versus right in America: one church leader \nis investigated for publicly opposing abortion and another for \ndiscussing the morality of the Iraq War. Indeed, the American people \nmay be surprised to learn this about their country.\n  The American people would allowing religious leaders, of all kinds, \nto speak their consciences on the issues facing our nation, and to do \nso without the threat of IRS punishment through the revocation of their \ntax-exempt status. This is why I am introducing legislation that will \ndo just that. The Religious Freedom Act of 2006 simply states that \nreligious leaders may discuss political matters, as a Constitutionally \nprotected right, without the threat of an IRS investigation. Upon \nenactment, this bill will reaffirm the Supreme Court's holding that \nthis country has a ``profound national commitment'' to a national \ndebate that is ``uninhibited, robust, and wide-open.'' It will also \nreaffirm Martin Luther King, Jr.'s ideal of churches as the \n``conscience of the state.'' I ask that the text of this statement be \nincluded in the Congressional Record by unanimous consent.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3957\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Religious Freedom Act of \n     2006''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PROTECTION OF FREEDOM OF SPEECH FOR HOUSES OF WORSHIP \n                   OR MEDITATION.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, no organization described in subsection (b) may be \n     denied its Federal tax exemption under the Internal Revenue \n     Code of 1986 by administrative or judicial action, nor shall \n     donors to such organization be denied the deductibility of \n     their contributions under such Code, because such \n     organization engages in an activity that is protected by the \n     United States Constitution, including comment on public \n     issues, election contests, and pending legislation made in \n     the theological or philosophical context of such \n     organization.\n       (b) Houses of Worship or Meditation and Affiliated \n     Organizations.--For purposes of subsection (a), an \n     organization described in this subsection is a church, \n     synagogue, mosque, temple, or other house of worship or \n     meditation (including any organization affiliated with any of \n     the foregoing)--\n\n[[Page S10305]]\n\n       (1) with an established form of worship or meditation and a \n     recognizable creed that minimally acknowledges the right of \n     others to freely accept or reject such form and creed, and\n       (2) which meets 2 or more of the following indicia: \n     definite and distinct ecclesiastical government; formal code \n     of doctrine and discipline; distinct religious history; \n     membership not axiomatically associated with any other \n     organization; organization of ordained ministers; ordained \n     ministers selected after completing prescribed courses of \n     study; a literature of its own; established places of worship \n     or meditation; regular congregations; regular religious \n     services; classes for the religious instruction of youth or \n     seniors or both; auxiliaries to provide relief and sustenance \n     to the poor and deprived; and auxiliaries to provide youth \n     with morally-structured community service and supervised \n     opportunities to compete in sport and intellect-expanding \n     activities as an alternative to destructive behavior such as \n     crime and drug use.\n       (c) Construction.--This section shall not be construed so \n     as to exempt any organization described in subsection (b) \n     from the operation of any other law generally applicable to \n     all organizations and individuals.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. CLINTON (for herself, Mr. Specter, Mr. Kennedy, and Ms. \n        Mikulski):\n  S. 3958. A bill to establish the United States Public Service \nAcademy; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat will create an undergraduate institution designed to cultivate a \ngeneration of young leaders dedicated to public service. The U.S. \nPublic Service Academy Act, the PSA Act, will establish a national \nacademy, modeled after the military service academies, to serve as an \nextraordinary example of effective, national public education.\n  The tragic events of September 11 and the devastation of natural \ndisasters Hurricanes Katrina and Rita have demonstrated just how \ncritical it is for our Nation to improve its ability to respond to \nfuture emergencies and to confront daily challenges. These events also \nunderscore how much our Nation depends upon strong public institutions \nand competent civilian leadership at all levels of society.\n  Our country must improve its ability to groom future public servants \nto fill the pipeline as the baby boomer generation approaches \nretirement from critical public sector careers. Recent studies have \nshown that 2 million teachers are approaching retirement this decade \nalone, and more than 80 percent of law enforcement agencies are unable \nto fill positions due to a lack of qualified candidates.\n  The PSA Act will establish the U.S. Public Service Academy to provide \na 4-year, federally subsidized college education for more than 5,000 \nstudents a year in exchange for a 5-year commitment to public service \nfollowing graduation. Academy graduates will help to fill the void in \npublic service our Nation will soon face by serving for 5 years in \nareas such as public education, public health, law enforcement, and the \nnonprofit sector.\n  Not only has the public service sector expressed a need for a young, \ntalented, and high-qualified workforce, many college students today \nhave already expressed a strong desire to serve. A recent study \nconducted by the Higher Education Research Institute found that more \nthan two-thirds of the 2005 freshman class expressed a desire to serve \nothers, the highest rate in a generation.\n  Unfortunately, as thousands of American youth seek to serve their \nNation in a civilian capacity, many are often priced out of public \nservice due to rising college debts. Over the past decade, the average \ndebt burden for a college graduate has increased by 58 percent. Many of \nthe students who want to serve our country owe more than $20,000 in \nstudent loans after graduating from college.\n  By providing a quality college education at no cost to the student, \nthe U.S. Public Service Academy would tap into the renewed sense of \npatriotism and civic obligation among young people and create a corps \nof competent civilian leaders.\n  The establishment of a U.S. Public Service Academy is an innovative \nway to strengthen and protect America by creating a corps of well-\ntrained, highly qualified civilian leaders. I am hopeful that my Senate \ncolleagues from both sides of the aisle will join me today to move this \nlegislation to the floor without delay.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WARNER (for himself and Mr. Allen):\n  S. 3959. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to exclude \nfrom gross income certain combat zone compensation of civilian \nemployees of the United States; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today along with my colleague \nSenator George Allen to introduce the Federal Employee Combat Zone Tax \nParity Act, which would provide parity to civilian Federal employees by \nextending the tax credit currently received by military personnel in \ncombat zones to the civilian Federal employees working along side them. \nMy fellow Virginian, Congressman Frank Wolf, has introduced a similar \nbill in the House of Representatives.\n  In addition, several Federal employee organizations, such as the \nAmerican Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), the National \nTreasury Employees Union (NTEU), the Financial Management Association \n(FMA), the Senior Executives Association (SEA), the American Foreign \nService Association (AFSA), and the National Federation of Federal \nEmployees (NFFE), strongly support this legislation.\n  As of today, I have made eleven separate trips to Iraq and \nAfghanistan to see firsthand the work of our military personnel, which \nis essential to success in these regions. In addition, the work of our \nFederal civilian employees in these regions is significantly important.\n  At the moment, a majority of the work in the reconstruction of these \ncountries is being done by the military and the Department of State \n(DOS). These dedicated men and women deserve our gratitude. However, as \nI have said on a number of occasions, our challenging task requires the \ncoordination and work of Federal agencies across the spectrum.\n  Regardless of whether one is in the military or a civilian, there are \ncertain risks and hardships associated with working overseas. As a \nresult, the Federal Government provides certain incentives to \nindividuals when they take on extremely challenging jobs. For example, \nthose in the military working in a combat zone receive the Combat Zone \nTax Credit.\n  This tax credit permits military personnel working in combat zones to \nexclude a certain amount of income from their Federal income taxes. \nThis benefit for the military was established in 1913.\n  Private contractors working in Iraq and Afghanistan get a similar \nbenefit. Under the Foreign Earned Income Tax Credit, contractors are \nallowed to exclude a portion of their income from taxes while they work \nabroad, like in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  To date, however, no similar benefit exists for Federal employees \nserving in the same combat zones. I do not believe it is fair for our \nFederal employees to be excluded from the same benefits available to \nmilitary personnel and private contractors in the same combat zone.\n  The Commonwealth of Virginia, of which I have been honored to serve \nfor the last 28 years in the Senate, is home to over 200,000 Federal \nemployees. I have long been a strong supporter of our Federal employees \nas I have been for our military personnel.\n  Our efforts in the war on terrorism can only be successful with a \nhighly skilled and experienced workforce. I can personally attest to \nthe dedication of civil service employees throughout the Federal \nGovernment. Since the September 11th attacks, Federal employees have \nbeen relocated, reassigned, and worked long hours under strenuous \ncircumstances without complaints, proving time and again their loyalty \nto their country is first and foremost.\n  During my service as Secretary of the Navy during which I was \nprivileged to have some 650,000 civilian employees working side by side \nwith the uniformed Navy, I valued very highly the sense of teamwork \nbetween the civilian and uniformed members of the United States Navy. \nTeamwork is an intrinsic military value, in my judgment, and essential \nto mission accomplishment. A sense of parity and fairness is important \nfor developing this teamwork.\n  In Iraq and Afghanistan, the teamwork of the entire Federal \nGovernment is essential to harness our overall efforts to secure a \nmeasure of democracy for the peoples of those countries, and\n\n[[Page S10306]]\n\nwe need to make it easier for our Federal employees to participate.\n  I recently offered additional legislation to achieve this goal. My \nbill, S. 2600, would provide the heads of agencies other than DOS and \nthe Department of Defense (DOD) with the authority, at their \ndiscretion, to give their employees who serve in Iraq and Afghanistan \nallowances, benefits, and gratuities comparable to those provided to \nState Department and DOD employees serving in those countries.\n  Currently, the agency heads of non-DOD and DOS agencies do not have \nsuch authority, and it is essential, as part of the U.S. effort to \nbring democracy and freedom to Iraq and Afghanistan, that agency heads \nbe able to give their workers in those countries the same benefits as \nthose they work beside.\n  In the last estimate, there are almost 2,000 Federal employees \nworking a variety of jobs in Iraq and Afghanistan. I am grateful for \ntheir hard work in potentially dangerous situations. And, I know there \nare many other Federal employees who are anxious to serve their country \nand engage in these efforts, but it is a lot to risk.\n  Providing parity in this important tax credit would provide a \nsignificant incentive for individuals to take on this challenge--a \nchallenge that America desperately needs Federal employees to \nundertake.\n  Throughout the world, America's civil servants are serving our \ngovernment and our people, often in dangerous situations. They are on \nthe ground in the war on terrorism taking over new roles to relieve \nmilitary personnel of tasks civilian employees can perform. They are \nplaying a vital role in the reconstruction of Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  We have a long tradition in Congress of recognizing the valuable \ncontributions of our Federal employees in both the military service and \nin the civil service by providing fair and equitable treatment. This \nbill gives us the ability to continue this tradition while at the same \ntime providing an important incentive to help America meet its needs.\n  I urge my colleagues to join with me in support of this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. STEVENS (for himself, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Lott, and Mr. \n        Lautenberg):\n  S. 3961. A bill to provide for enhanced safety in pipeline \ntransportation, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Pipeline \nInspection, Protection, Enforcement, and Safety Act of 2006. I am \njoined by my colleagues from the Commerce, Science, and Transportation \nCommittee, Senators Inouye, Lott and Lautenberg.\n  Pipelines are one of the safest forms of transportation, and in most \ncases their safety record has been steadily improving. Unfortunately \nhowever, as recent events in my State demonstrate, there is still much \nto be done. This bill addresses the problems that have occurred in \nAlaska and other safety issues that have been brought to the \nCommittee's attention.\n  The bill reauthorizes the pipeline safety programs of the Pipeline \nand Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) for Fiscal Years \n2007 through 2010.\n  Highlights of the bill include:\n  Increased Department of Transportation Resources Dedicated to \nOverseeing Pipeline Safety--The bill provides an additional 45 Federal \ninspectors (a 50 percent increase) over the 4 years of the bill at a \ncost of $6 million in Fiscal Year 2010. Currently PHMSA has 90 \ninspectors, but the DOT Inspector General has stated in the past that \nthese relatively low staffing levels are a matter for concern. Ninety \ninspectors translate to one inspector for every 18,000 miles of \npipeline in this country.\n  Strengtened Programs to Reduce Construction Related Damage to \nPipelines--The bill includes new civil enforcement authority against \nexcavators and pipeline operators responsible for third-party damage \nincidents and provides grants to states that have damage prevention \nprograms in place. Construction related damage, such as damage caused \nby excavation for a highway project, is the greatest cause of pipeline \naccidents that result in death or injury. This occurs most often on the \ndistribution systems that run through the neighborhoods where people \nlive and work. These incidents have increased by 49 percent since 1996.\n  Applying DOT Safety Standards to the Currently Unregulated Low Stress \nPipelines--On August 31, the DOT announced proposed rules to cover low \nstress pipelines in unusually sensitive areas. Pipeline operators will \nhave to meet new safety requirements, including cleaning and continuous \nmonitoring, along more than 1,200 miles of pipelines. However, low-\nstress lines that aren't in such sensitive areas would continue to be \nunregulated. The bill goes further than the regulation and requires DOT \noversight of all low-stress pipelines.\n  Increased Accountability of Pipeline Company Officials--The bill \nincludes a provision that would require senior officials at pipeline \ncompanies to certify that the information they are providing to \nregulators is accurate.\n  Enhanced Pipeline Research--The bill would also boost PHMSA's \nresearch and technology development budget for pipeline safety issues \nsuch as corrosion by $10 million over the length of the bill.\n  A Study of Pipelines Critical to Energy Supply--The bill includes a \nstudy of oil pipelines that are critical to the nation's energy supply \nin order to determine if there are sufficient safety regulations in \nplace to ensure their safety.\n  The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and the House \nEnergy and Commerce Committee are also working on pipeline safety \nlegislation. I hope that our three Committees can work together over \nthe next month while the Congress is out of session to develop a joint \nlegislative product that we can pass and have signed into law when we \nreturn in November. Many of the provisions in the three bills are \nsimilar and we should have enough common ground to achieve this goal.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself and Mr. Craig):\n  S. 3962. A bill to enhance the management and disposal of spent \nnuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste, to assure protection of \npublic health and safety, to ensure the territorial integrity and \nsecurity of the repository at Yucca Mountain, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I note the arrival on the floor of the \ndistinguished Senator from Nevada. The legislation that I will be \ntalking about is of significant interest to the Senator from Nevada. \nBut it will take many months on the floor of the Senate before we \nfinish.\n  Today my fellow Senators I am introducing legislation that I believe \nwill place the Department of Energy's nuclear waste program back on \ntrack.\n  As we all know, the history of the Yucca Mountain project has been \nrocky at best. The Yucca Mountain project has a very long pedigree, \nstarting back to the late 1950's when the National Academy of Sciences \nreported to the Atomic Energy Commission suggesting that burying \nradioactive high-level waste in geologic formations should receive \nconsideration.\n  In the 1980s, when Congress decided to pursue a geologic repository, \nwe were quite optimistic--so optimistic that we told the Department of \nEnergy--DOE--to enter into contracts with utilities that promised that \nwe would begin taking nuclear waste off their hands by 1998. Well, \nobviously that didn't happen. What did happen was that the courts found \nthat the government is liable for its failure to meet its contractual \nobligation.\n\n  While moving more slowly than planned, DOE's nuclear waste program \nhas made progress toward making the goal of a permanent geologic \nrepository for nuclear waste a reality. In 2002, the President and \nCongress approved the Yucca Mountain site, and instructed DOE to file a \nlicense application for the repository with the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission--NRC. That decision has been made.\n  With the siting decision made, it will now be up to the NRC to \nevaluate the scientific data and determine whether the repository will \npermanently, and safely, isolate nuclear waste.\n  Yucca Mountain is the cornerstone of our national comprehensive spent \nnuclear fuel management strategy for\n\n[[Page S10307]]\n\nthis country. Let me be clear: We need Yucca Mountain. We must make \nthis program work. I believe the bill introduced today will do that.\n  This bill will remove legal barriers that will allow DOE to meet its \nobligation to accept and store spent nuclear fuel as soon as possible, \nwithout prejudging the outcome of the NRC's repository licensing \ndecision.\n  The bill I will introduce today authorizes the DOE to permanently \nwithdraw 147,000 acres currently controlled by the Bureau of Land \nManagement, the Air Force, and the Nevada Test Site, a license \ncondition of the NRC.\n\n  This legislation will repeal the arbitrary 70,000 metric ton \nstatutory limit on emplacement of radioactive material at Yucca \nMountain. The capacity of the mountain will be determined by scientific \nand technical analysis.\n  The DOE may also begin construction of needed infrastructure for the \nrepository and surface storage facilities as soon as they complete an \nenvironmental impact statement that evaluates these activities.\n  This legislation will begin to consolidate the defense waste and \nspent nuclear fuel at Yucca Mountain. The bill requires DOE to file for \na permit to build a surface storage facility at the Nevada Test Site at \nthe same time it files its license application for a repository at \nYucca Mountain.\n  As soon as the department receives the permit for the surface storage \nfacilities from the NRC, the department may begin moving defense fuel \nand waste to the Nevada Test Site. The spent nuclear fuel from our Navy \nand defense activities that kept us safe during the Cold War will be \nconsolidated and secure at the site.\n  Only after the NRC issues a construction permit for Yucca Mountain, \nmay the department begin moving civilian spent fuel to the Nevada Test \nSite.\n  This bill will withdraw the land for the rail route for Yucca, a \nvital transportation component. There is a provision that also provides \nthat appropriations from the Nuclear Waste Fund will not count against \nthe allocations for discretionary spending. The DOE will have access to \nthe full funds in the Nuclear Waste Fund, monies collected from our \nconstituents, to complete this project.\n\n  This bill compliments the short, medium, and long term components of \nthe nuclear fuel cycle that I began to talk about this past summer. The \nthinking of how to handle nuclear spent fuel in the late 1970s and \nearly 1980s and the way we approached its management is changing, we \nneed to acknowledge that change.\n  In the short term, according to DOE's most optimistic schedule, the \nNRC's construction permit will not be issued until 2011. The \nConsolidated and Preparation ``CAP'' proposal in the Energy and Water \nAppropriations bill begins to enable DOE to fulfill its contractual \nliability for spent fuel storage before DOE can move spent fuel to \nYucca Mountain by providing new authorities for DOE to accept and store \ncivilian spent nuclear fuel within the states in which it was \ngenerated.\n  In the mid term, this legislation lays the foundation to integrate \nYucca Mountain and Global Nuclear Energy Partnership--GNEP--by \nproviding that before spent fuel is shipped to Nevada, the Secretary of \nEnergy determines if it can be recycled within a reasonable amount of \ntime. Current plans for GNEP do not include recycling all 55,000 metric \ntons of civilian spent fuel that has already been generated. This \nproposal will avoid moving waste to Nevada that should be shipped \ninstead to a GNEP facility.\n  In the long term, this measure provides DOE with the authorities \nneeded to execute the Yucca Mountain project, and to begin long term \nemplacement, while the GNEP program will reduce the volume of material \nto be emplaced in the mountain, eliminating the need for a second \nrepository program.\n  The three pieces of the fuel cycle that I have discussed today--\ninterim storage, GNEP and Yucca Mountain--will establish a \ncomprehensive program that will provide confidence that our nation's \nnuclear waste will be managed safely both for current and future \nreactors.\n  We can solve this problem and I hope we can move forward together.\n  I send to the desk a bill which does all of the things that I have \njust spoken to. I am sure many Senators and their staffs will be \ninterested. This will certainly not proceed in any hurry; it will take \na while. But I intend to move it as best I can. There will be \nopportunities to stop the movement at every opportunity. I am just \nhopeful that we will carry all the way through, as we have in the past, \nand go to conference and take something to the President and see where \nwe are.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I want to again express my appreciation to \nthe distinguished Senator from New Mexico--I know this is a feeling \nshared by a lot of Senators--for his efforts and leadership over many \nyears in the Senate but particularly in the energy area. He has been \npersistent.\n  We did pass a good energy policy bill last year. Obviously, he would \nlike for it to have been, perhaps, even broader, but we got it done. It \nis making a contribution and will continue to have a positive \ncontribution into more diverse energy policy in this country from which \nthe American people will benefit.\n  I thank the Senator for his leadership on this particular area of the \nnuclear repository. We must deal with this issue. We can do it. His \ninput was critical. I thank him.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator. It is a pleasure working with him.\n  When I have legislation such as the legislation I just described, \nwhich is very difficult, and I know we are going to come to spots in \nthe Senate, stopovers where we will have to vote because it is good for \nthe country, I am counting in the column that if I have done my work, \nwill this Senator vote for it, the Senator's name. I believe if we do \nour work and get our votes properly and line up what we propose, a \nSenator such as Senator Lott will not be running around asking people \nwhat is going on in his State.\n  This matter deserves his attention, as it deserves my attention. I \nbelieve we will get that.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support \nfor the Nuclear Fuel Management and Disposal Act introduced today by \nSenator Pete Domenici. Senator Domenici has long been a courageous \nsupporter of dependable, emissions-free nuclear energy, and he is \nlargely responsible for the current renaissance of nuclear power in \nthis country--with upwards of 30 new nuclear reactors on the drawing \nboard to be licensed in the next several years. Senator Domenici's \nlandmark legislation will help assure the future of nuclear power in \nthis country by providing the necessary legislation for moving forward \non the long-stalled Yucca Mountain repository and authorizing much-\nneeded interim storage for spent fuel and high-level waste that has \nbeen accumulating around the country. For used nuclear fuel that will \neventually be recycled, the Senate Energy and Water Appropriations bill \napproved by the Appropriations Committee earlier this year provides for \ninterim storage of commercial spent fuel at Consolidation and \nPreparation--CAP--facilities. Senator Domenici's legislation introduced \ntoday addresses defense spent fuel and high-level waste that cannot be \nrecycled, so that these wastes will be sent to Yucca Mountain for \nstorage and eventual disposal. In this way, this bill removes the final \nroadblock to developing new nuclear power in this country.\n  And let me say a few words about this ``roadblock'' to Yucca that has \npersisted for so many years. The Federal Government made a promise to \ntake possession of spent nuclear fuel in order to safely and \npermanently dispose of it in a geologic repository. We promised to \nbegin taking this fuel back in 1998--8 years ago. However, through \nconcerted efforts by the state of Nevada and its congressional \ndelegation, progress on Yucca has often slowed to a crawl. This is the \nclassic NIMBY attitude--``not in my backyard.'' And yet my colleague \nfrom Nevada, Mr. Reid, has repeatedly called for this Congress and the \nadministration to do something to help reduce emissions of greenhouse \ngases because of his concerns about global warming.\n  This Congress and this administration have done a great deal to \npromote emission-free power generation. This Congress passed the Energy \nPolicy Act last year, which provided financial incentives for new, \nemission-free sources\n\n[[Page S10308]]\n\nof energy, including wind, solar, clean coal--and nuclear. And earlier \nthis year, this administration introduced the Advanced Energy \nInitiative--AEI--to support research and development of new energy \nsources--including nuclear power. In fact, the Global Nuclear Energy \nPartnership--GNEP--is one part of the AEI. One goal of GNEP is to \nreduce the amount and toxicity of nuclear waste ultimately destined for \ndisposal at Yucca Mountain; another goal is to eventually help expand \nthe deployment of emission-free nuclear power in developing countries \nthat otherwise would need to depend on burning fossil fuels for their \ngrowing energy demands. Contrary to Senator Reid's comments about doing \nnothing to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, we have done a great \ndeal to develop emission-free energy in this country and abroad. But \nthe deployment of nuclear power requires that we manage the spent fuel \nfrom nuclear power plants in a safe and responsible manner. One aspect \nof that management strategy must be to open the Yucca Mountain \nrepository as soon as possible.\n  As Senator Domenici has said, Yucca Mountain is the cornerstone of a \ncomprehensive spent-fuel management strategy for this country, but \nYucca alone cannot meet the government's spent-fuel obligations. \nThrough GNEP we will also explore technologies that promise to reduce \nthe volume and toxicity of spent fuel. Thus, GNEP, interim storage and \nYucca Mountain together provide a comprehensive program for safely \nmanaging our Nation's Nuclear waste.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/27/senate-section/article/S10308-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10308]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 588--TO EXPRESS THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT STATES \n    SHOULD HAVE IN PLACE BACKUP SYSTEMS TO DEAL WITH ANY FAILURE OF \n   ELECTRONIC VOTING EQUIPMENT DURING THE NOVEMBER 7, 2006, GENERAL \n                                ELECTION\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself and Mr. Kerry) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration:\n\n                              S.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Military Commissions Act of \n     2006''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Constitution of the United States grants to \n     Congress the power ``To define and punish . . . Offenses \n     against the Law of Nations'', as well as the power ``To \n     declare War . . . To raise and support Armies . . . [and] To \n     provide and maintain a Navy''.\n       (2) The military commission is the traditional tribunal for \n     the trial of persons engaged in hostilities for violations of \n     the law of war.\n       (3) Congress has, in the past, both authorized the use of \n     military commission by statute and recognized the existence \n     and authority of military commissions.\n       (4) Military commissions have been convened both by the \n     President and by military commanders in the field to try \n     offenses against the law of war.\n       (5) It is in the national interest for Congress to exercise \n     its authority under the Constitution to enact legislation \n     authorizing and regulating the use of military commissions to \n     try and punish violations of the law of war.\n       (6) Military commissions established and operating under \n     chapter 47A of title 10, United States Code (as enacted by \n     this Act), are regularly constituted courts affording, in the \n     words of Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions, ``all \n     the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable \n     by civilized peoples''.\n\n     SEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION FOR MILITARY COMMISSIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The President is authorized to establish \n     military commissions for the trial of alien unlawful enemy \n     combatants engaged in hostilities against the United States \n     for violations of the law of war and other offenses \n     specifically made triable by military commission as provided \n     in chapter 47 of title 10, United States Code, and chapter \n     47A of title 10, United States Code (as enacted by this Act).\n       (b) Construction.--The authority in subsection (a) may not \n     be construed to alter or limit the authority of the President \n     under the Constitution and laws of the United States to \n     establish military commissions for areas declared to be under \n     martial law or in occupied territories should circumstances \n     so require.\n       (c) Scope of Punishment Authority.--A military commission \n     established pursuant to subsection (a) shall have authority \n     to impose upon any person found guilty under a proceeding \n     under chapter 47A of title 10, United States Code (as so \n     enacted), a sentence that is appropriate for the offense or \n     offenses for which there is a finding of guilt, including a \n     sentence of death if authorized under such chapter, \n     imprisonment for life or a term of years, payment of a fine \n     or restitution, or such other lawful punishment or condition \n     of punishment as the military commission shall direct.\n       (d) Execution of Punishment.--The Secretary of Defense is \n     authorized to carry out a sentence of punishment imposed by a \n     military commission established pursuant to subsection (a) in \n     accordance with such procedures as the Secretary may \n     prescribe.\n       (e) Annual Report on Trials by Military Commissions.--\n       (1) Annual report required.--Not later than December 31 \n     each year, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to the \n     Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives a report on any trials conducted by military \n     commissions established pursuant to subsection (a) during \n     such year.\n       (2) Form.--Each report under this subsection shall be \n     submitted in unclassified form, but may include a classified \n     annex.\n\n     SEC. 4. MILITARY COMMISSIONS.\n\n       (a) Military Commissions.--\n       (1) In general.--Subtitle A of title 10, United States \n     Code, is amended by inserting after chapter 47 the following \n     new chapter:\n\n                  ``CHAPTER 47A--MILITARY COMMISSIONS\n\n``SUBCHAPTER......................................................Sec. \n``I.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs be discharged from \nfurther consideration of S. 2250, and the Senate proceed to its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2250) to award a Congressional Gold Medal to Dr. \n     Norman E. Borlaug.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today the Senate pays tribute to a true \nAmerican hero and fellow native Iowan in passing S. 2250, a bill to \naward Dr. Norman E. Borlaug the Congressional Gold Medal, which is the \nhighest congressional expression of national appreciation for \ndistinguished achievement and contribution. This is a fitting honor to \na man who is frequently credited with saving more lives than anyone who \nhas ever lived.\n  Commonly known as ``The Father of the Green Revolution,'' Dr. \nBorlaug's scientific and humanitarian efforts have saved countless \npeople from starvation and hunger while raising standards of living \nthroughout the world.\n  Dr. Borlaug was born in 1914 near Cresco, IA. Like many Iowans at the \ntime, he grew up on a small farm and attended a one-room school house \nfor his first 8 years of education. After graduating from high school, \nhe attended the University of Minnesota and earned his bachelor of \nscience in forestry. Immediately after receiving his degree in 1937, he \nworked for the U.S. Forestry Service. He returned to the University of \nMinnesota to receive his master's degree in 1939 and doctorate in 1942.\n  In 1944 Dr. Borlaug accepted an appointment as a geneticist and plant \npathologist with the Cooperative Wheat Research and Production Program \nin Mexico. This program was a joint undertaking by the Mexican \nGovernment and the Rockefeller Foundation involving research in plant \ngenetics, plant breeding, plant pathology, agronomy, soil science, and \ncereal technology. He spent two decades working with farmers in Mexico \nto develop a new disease resistant variety of wheat that could triple \nits output in grain. This breakthrough achievement in plant breeding \nenabled Mexico to become self-sufficient in wheat production while \nvastly improving the livelihood of many poor farmers.\n  The United Nations asked Dr. Borlaug to travel to India and Pakistan \nin the 1960s to help the warring countries, which were threatened with \nan imminent pandemic famine. Working with scientists from both \ncountries, Dr. Borlaug convinced India and Pakistan to adopt his new \nseeds and approach to agriculture to avert potential starvation and \nfamine. In a short time, both countries attained self-sufficiency in \nwheat production and millions of people were saved from hunger, famine \nand death. Dr. Borlaug continued his work in Southeast Asia, and the \nresults were the same.\n  In 1970, Dr. Borlaug was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work \nin agriculture, reversing food shortages and saving millions of lives. \nToday, at the age of 92, Dr. Borlaug continues his tireless work to \nalleviate and prevent hunger throughout the world. He is the head of \nthe Sasakawa Global 2000 program, which is working to bring the Green \nRevolution to Africa and alleviate hunger and malnutrition in the sub-\nSaharan region. He founded the World Food Prize in 1986 as a means to \nrecognize and inspire achievements in increasing the quality, quantity \nand availability of food in the world. He also continues his role as an \neducator at Texas A University while also continuing research at the \nInternational Center for the Improvement of Wheat and Maize in Mexico.\n  Dr. Borlaug has been awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the \nNational Academy of Science's Public Service Medal and the Rotary \nInternational Award for World Understanding and Peace. Today the Senate \napproves legislation to award Dr. Borlaug the Congressional Gold Medal. \nDr. Borlaug is a true American hero and it is fitting that Congress \nhonors this man who has done so much to alleviate hunger and human \nsuffering, improve the quality of life around the globe and promote \nunderstanding and peace among all of the world's people.\n  I would like to thank Senator Grassley and the many cosponsors of \nthis bill for their support and work to honor Dr. Borlaug with this \nhigh distinction.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and that any statements relating to the measure be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, was read \nthe third time, and passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2250\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Congressional Tribute to Dr. \n     Norman E. Borlaug Act of 2006''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) Dr. Norman E. Borlaug, was born in Iowa where he grew \n     up on a family farm, and received his primary and secondary \n     education.\n       (2) Dr. Borlaug attended the University of Minnesota where \n     he received his B.A. and Ph.D. degrees and was also a star \n     NCAA wrestler.\n       (3) For the past 20 years, Dr. Borlaug has lived in Texas \n     where he is a member of the faculty of Texas A University.\n       (4) Dr. Borlaug also serves as President of the Sasakawa \n     Africa Association.\n       (5) Dr. Borlaug's accomplishments in terms of bringing \n     radical change to world agriculture and uplifting humanity \n     are without parallel.\n       (6) In the immediate aftermath of World War II, Dr. Borlaug \n     spent 20 years working in the poorest areas of rural Mexico. \n     It was there that Dr. Borlaug made his breakthrough \n     achievement in developing a strand of wheat that could \n     exponentially increase yields while actively resisting \n     disease.\n       (7) With the active support of the governments involved, \n     Dr. Borlaug's ``green revolution'' uplifted hundreds of \n     thousands of the rural poor in Mexico and saved hundreds of \n     millions from famine and outright starvation in India and \n     Pakistan.\n       (8) Dr. Borlaug's approach to wheat production next spread \n     throughout the Middle East. Soon thereafter his approach was \n     adapted to rice growing, increasing the number of lives Dr. \n     Borlaug has saved to more than a billion people.\n       (9) In 1970, Dr. Borlaug received the Nobel Prize, the only \n     person working in agriculture to ever be so honored. Since \n     then he has received numerous honors and awards including the \n     Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Public Service Medal, the \n     National Academy of Sciences' highest honor, and the Rotary \n     International Award for World Understanding and Peace.\n       (10) At age 91, Dr. Borlaug continues to work to alleviate \n     poverty and malnutrition.

Mr. President, I would like to address the habeas corpus\n\n[[Page S10347]]\n\namendment that is on the floor and that we just heard a lengthy debate \nabout between Senator Specter and Senator Warner.\n  A few years ago, I gave a speech in Boston that people talk about \nfrom time to time. In that speech, I spoke about why I love this \ncountry, why I love America, and what I believe sets this country apart \nfrom so many other nations in so many areas. I said:\n\n       That is the true genius of America--a faith in simple \n     dreams, an insistence on small miracles; that we can tuck in \n     our children at night and know that they are fed and clothed \n     and safe from harm; that we can say what we think, write what \n     we think, without hearing a sudden knock on the door. . . .\n\n  Without hearing a sudden knock on the door. I bring this up because \nwhat is at stake in this bill, and in the amendment that is currently \nbeing debated, is the right, in some sense, for people who hear that \nknock on the door and are placed in detention because the Government \nsuspects them of terrorist activity to effectively challenge their \ndetention by our Government.\n  Now, under the existing rules of the Detainee Treatment Act, court \nreview of anyone's detention is severely restricted. Fortunately, the \nSupreme Court in Hamdan ensured that some meaningful review would take \nplace. But in the absence of Senator Specter's amendment that is \ncurrently pending, we will essentially be going back to the same \nsituation as if the Supreme Court had never ruled in Hamdan, a \nsituation in which detainees effectively have no access to anything \nother than the Combatant Status Review Tribunal, or the CSRT.\n  Now, I think it is important for all of us to understand exactly the \nprocedures that are currently provided for under the CSRT. I have \nactually read a few of the transcripts of proceedings under the CSRT. \nAnd I can tell you that oftentimes they provide detainees no meaningful \nrecourse if the Government has the wrong guy.\n  Essentially, reading these transcripts, they proceed as follows: The \nGovernment says: You are a member of the Taliban. And the detainee will \nsay: No, I'm not. And then the Government will not ask for proof from \nthe detainee that he is not. There is no evidence that the detainee can \noffer to rebut the Government's charge.\n  The Government then moves on and says: And on such and such a date, \nyou perpetrated such and such terrorist crime. And the detainee says: \nNo, I didn't. You have the wrong guy. But again, he has no capacity to \nplace into evidence anything that would rebut the Government's charge. \nAnd there is no effort to find out whether or not what he is saying is \ntrue.\n  And it proceeds like that until effectively the Government says, OK, \nthat is the end of the tribunal, and he goes back to detention. Even if \nthere is evidence that he was not involved in any terrorist activity, \nhe may not have any mechanism to introduce that evidence into the \nhearing.\n  Now, the vast majority of the folks in Guantanamo, I suspect, are \nthere for a reason. There are a lot of dangerous people. Particularly \ndangerous are people like Khalid Shaikh Mohammed. Ironically, those are \nthe guys who are going to get real military procedures because they are \ngoing to be charged by the Government. But detainees who have not \ncommitted war crimes--or where the Government's case is not strong--may \nnot have any recourse whatsoever.\n  The bottom line is this: Current procedures under the CSRT are such \nthat a perfectly innocent individual could be held and could not rebut \nthe Government's case and has no way of proving his innocence.\n  I would like somebody in this Chamber, somebody in this Government, \nto tell me why this is necessary. I do not want to hear that this is a \nnew world and we face a new kind of enemy. I know that. I know that \nevery time I think about my two little girls and worry for their \nsafety--when I wonder if I really can tuck them in at night and know \nthat they are safe from harm. I have as big of a stake as anybody on \nthe other side of the aisle and anybody in this administration in \ncapturing terrorists and incapacitating them. I would gladly take up \narms myself against any terrorist threat to make sure my family is \nprotected.\n  But as a parent, I can also imagine the terror I would feel if one of \nmy family members were rounded up in the middle of the night and sent \nto Guantanamo without even getting one chance to ask why they were \nbeing held and being able to prove their innocence.\n  This is not just an entirely fictional scenario, by the way. We have \nalready had reports by the CIA and various generals over the last few \nyears saying that many of the detainees at Guantanamo should not have \nbeen there. As one U.S. commander of Guantanamo told the Wall Street \nJournal:\n\n       Sometimes, we just didn't get the right folks.\n\n  We all know about the recent case of the Canadian man who was \nsuspected of terrorist connections, detained in New York, sent to \nSyria--through a rendition agreement--tortured, only to find out later \nit was all a case of mistaken identity and poor information.\n  In this war, where terrorists can plot undetected from within our \nborders, it is absolutely vital that our law enforcement agencies are \nable to detain and interrogate whoever they believe to be a \nsuspect, and so it is understandable that mistakes will be made and \nidentities will be confused. I don't blame the Government for that. \nThis is an extraordinarily difficult war we are prosecuting against \nterrorists. There are going to be situations in which we cast too wide \na net and capture the wrong person.\n\n  But what is avoidable is refusing to ever allow our legal system to \ncorrect these mistakes. By giving suspects a chance--even one chance--\nto challenge the terms of their detention in court, to have a judge \nconfirm that the Government has detained the right person for the right \nsuspicions, we could solve this problem without harming our efforts in \nthe war on terror one bit.\n  Let me respond to a couple of points that have been made on the other \nside. You will hear opponents of this amendment say it will give all \nkinds of rights to terrorist masterminds, such as Khalid Shaikh \nMohammed. But that is not true. The irony of the underlying bill as it \nis written is that someone like Khalid Shaikh Mohammed is going to get \nbasically a full military trial, with all of the bells and whistles. He \nwill have counsel, he will be able to present evidence, and he will be \nable to rebut the Government's case. The feeling is that he is guilty \nof a war crime and to do otherwise might violate some of our agreements \nunder the Geneva Conventions. I think that is good, that we are going \nto provide him with some procedure and process. I think we will convict \nhim, and I think he will be brought to justice. I think justice will be \ncarried out in his case.\n  But that won't be true for the detainees who are never charged with a \nterrorist crime, who have not committed a war crime. Under this bill, \npeople who may have been simply at the wrong place at the wrong time--\nand there may be just a few--will never get a chance to appeal their \ndetention. So, essentially, the weaker the Government's case is against \nyou, the fewer rights you have. Senator Specter's amendment would fix \nthat, while still ensuring that terrorists like Mohammed are swiftly \nbrought to justice.\n  You are also going to hear a lot about how lawyers are going to file \nall kinds of frivolous lawsuits on behalf of detainees if habeas corpus \nis in place. This is a cynical argument because I think we could get \noverwhelming support in this Chamber right now for a measure that would \nrestrict habeas to a one-shot appeal that would be limited solely to \nwhether someone was legally detained or not. I am not interested in \nallowing folks at Guantanamo to complain about whether their cell is \ntoo small or whether the food they get is sufficiently edible or to \ntheir tastes. That is not what this is about. We can craft a habeas \nbill that says the only question before the court is whether there is \nsufficient evidence to find that this person is truly an unlawful enemy \ncombatant and belongs in this detention center. We can restrict it to \nthat. And although I have seen some of those amendments floating \naround, those were not amendments that were admitted during this \ndebate. It is a problem that is easily addressed. It is not a reason \nfor us to wholesale eliminate habeas corpus.\n  Finally, you will hear some Senators argue that if habeas is allowed, \nit renders the CSRT process irrelevant because the courts will embark \non de\n\n[[Page S10348]]\n\nnovo review, meaning they will completely retry these cases, take new \nevidence. So whatever findings were made in the CSRT are not really \nrelevant because the court is essentially going to start all over \nagain.\n  I actually think some of these Senators are right on this point. I \nbelieve we could actually set up a system in which a military tribunal \nis sufficient to make a determination as to whether someone is an enemy \ncombatant and would not require the sort of traditional habeas corpus \nthat is called for as a consequence of this amendment, where the \ncourt's role is simply to see whether proper procedures were met. The \nproblem is that the way the CSRT is currently designed is so \ninsufficient that we can anticipate the Supreme Court overturning this \nunderlying bill, once again, in the absence of habeas corpus review.\n\n  I have had conversations with some of the sponsors of the underlying \nbill who say they agree that we have to beef up the CSRT procedures. \nWell, if we are going to revisit the CSRT procedures to make them \nstronger and make sure they comport with basic due process, why not \nleave habeas corpus in place until we have actually fixed it up to our \nsatisfaction? Why rush through it 2 days before we are supposed to \nadjourn? Because some on the other side of the aisle want to go \ncampaign on the issue of who is tougher on terrorism and national \nsecurity.\n  Since 9/11, Americans have been asked to give up certain conveniences \nand civil liberties--long waits in airport security lines, random \nquestioning because of a foreign-sounding last name--so that the \nGovernment can defeat terrorism wherever it may exist. It is a tough \nbalance to strike. I think we have to acknowledge that whoever was in \npower right now, whoever was in the White House, whichever party was in \ncontrol, that we would have to do some balancing between civil \nliberties and our need for security and to get tough on those who would \ndo us harm.\n  Most of us have been willing to make some sacrifices because we know \nthat, in the end, it helps to make us safer. But restricting somebody's \nright to challenge their imprisonment indefinitely is not going to make \nus safer. In fact, recent evidence shows it is probably making us less \nsafe.\n  In Sunday's New York Times, it was reported that previous drafts of \nthe recently released National Intelligence Estimate, a report of 16 \ndifferent Government intelligence agencies, describe:\n\n       . . . actions by the United States Government that were \n     determined to have stoked the jihad movement, like the \n     indefinite detention of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. . . .\n\n  This is not just unhelpful in our fight against terror, it is \nunnecessary. We don't need to imprison innocent people to win this war. \nFor people who are guilty, we have the procedures in place to lock them \nup. That is who we are as a people. We do things right, and we do \nthings fair.\n  Two days ago, every Member of this body received a letter, signed by \n35 U.S. diplomats, many of whom served under Republican Presidents. \nThey urged us to reconsider eliminating the rights of habeas corpus \nfrom this bill, saying:\n\n       To deny habeas corpus to our detainees can be seen as a \n     prescription for how the captured members of our own \n     military, diplomatic, and NGO personnel stationed abroad may \n     be treated. . . . The Congress has every duty to insure their \n     protection, and to avoid anything which will be taken as a \n     justification, even by the most disturbed minds, that \n     arbitrary arrest is the acceptable norm of the day in the \n     relations between nations, and that judicial inquiry is an \n     antique, trivial and dispensable luxury.\n\n  The world is watching what we do today in America. They will know \nwhat we do here today, and they will treat all of us accordingly in the \nfuture--our soldiers, our diplomats, our journalists, anybody who \ntravels beyond these borders. I hope we remember this as we go forward. \nI sincerely hope we can protect what has been called the ``great \nwrit''--a writ that has been in place in the Anglo-American legal \nsystem for over 700 years.\n  Mr. President, this should not be a difficult vote. I hope we pass \nthis amendment because I think it is the only way to make sure this \nunderlying bill preserves all the great traditions of our legal system \nand our way of life.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/27/senate-section/article/S10348-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10348]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
