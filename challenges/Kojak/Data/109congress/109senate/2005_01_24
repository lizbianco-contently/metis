The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S108]]\n\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 7) relating to the death of Howard S. \n     Liebengood, former Sergeant at Arms of the Senate.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 7) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                               S. Res. 7\n\n       Whereas Howard S. Liebengood served as a captain in the \n     United States Army Military Police Corps in Vietnam from 1968 \n     to 1970, receiving the Bronze Star and the Army Commendation \n     Medal for his exemplary service;\n       Whereas Howard S. Liebengood began his service to the \n     Senate in 1973 as minority counsel to the Senate Watergate \n     Committee;\n       Whereas Howard S. Liebengood served as an aide to the \n     Senate Church Committee in 1975, as the minority staff \n     director of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence in \n     1976, and as legislative counsel to Senate Majority Leader \n     Howard H. Baker, Jr., in 1980;\n       Whereas Howard S. Liebengood served as Sergeant at Arms of \n     the Senate from 1981 to 1983;\n       Whereas Howard S. Liebengood served as chief of staff to \n     Senator Fred Thompson from 2001 to 2003, and as chief of \n     staff to Senate Majority Leader William H. Frist, M.D., from \n     2003 until his death in January, 2005;\n       Whereas Howard S. Liebengood was a caring and devoted \n     husband, father, and colleague who served with the utmost \n     humility and distinction and was admired and respected by all \n     as a teacher, adviser, and friend; and\n       Whereas Howard S. Liebengood inspired others through his \n     personal leadership, generosity, and great love for the \n     United States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) the Senate has heard with profound sorrow and deep \n     regret the announcement of the death of Howard S. Liebengood; \n     and\n       (2) the Secretary of the Senate communicate these \n     resolutions to the House of Representatives and transmit an \n     enrolled copy of these resolutions to the family of Howard S. \n     Liebengood.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, Howard Liebengood loved the Senate. He \nloved the purpose of this institution; he loved its tradition; and, \nabove all, he loved its people. The Senate was his extended family, and \nwe all are going to miss him very much.\n  Howard Schuler Liebengood passed away on Thursday, January 13, at his \nhome in Vienna, VA. He was just 2 weeks shy of his retirement. He had \nplanned to travel and cook and devote himself to his wife Dee and their \nthree grown children, Howie, John, and Anne.\n  We talked in detail at breakfast about a month ago, in late December, \nabout his excitement of being able to retire and spend time with the \nfamily.\n  He also told me he planned on going to the track. One of his closest \nfriends and a real friend of this institution, Marty Gold, said Howard \nloved anything that ran around the track, whether it was cars or dogs \nor people. And every May, without exception, Howard went to the Indy \n500 with his family.\n  Howard lived with passion. He lived with conviction. He lived with \ngenerosity. He lived with grace. He accomplished so much because he \nloved life so well.\n  Howard was born on December 29, 1942, in South Bend, IN. Franklin \nDelano Roosevelt was President, stamps cost 3 cents, and total Federal \nspending was a mere $35 billion.\n  Howard graduated from Plymouth High in 1960 and earned his bachelors \ndegree in political science at Kansas State University. From there he \nwent to Vanderbilt University Law School where he met a young man who \nwould become his closest and lifelong friend and future U.S. Senator, \nFred Thompson. Howard once described the two of them as misfits among \nthe well-heeled southern scholars and Ivy League stars. But knowing \nthem both, I suspect it was just Howard's characteristic midwestern \nmodesty.\n  After earning his law degree from Vanderbilt, Howard served as an \nArmy captain in the Vietnam war. His bravery and valor earned him the \nBronze Star and the Army Commendation Medal.\n  Upon his return from Vietnam in 1970, Howard applied for and won the \ncompetition to be assistant general manager and play-by-play announcer \nfor the Kansas City Royals AAA farm club. But it was not to be. A young \nwife and the prospect of a future family led him to the offices of \nManier, White in Nashville, TN, where he practiced criminal and \nentertainment law.\n  Then, just as he was to become partner, he got a call. Fred was \nminority counsel to the newly formed Senate Watergate Committee, and he \nwanted Howard at his side. It was 1973, the height of Watergate. \nSenator Howard Baker of Tennessee was vice chair of the committee. It \nwas an offer too good to refuse.\n  Howard soon found himself in the center of the Watergate whirlwind, \ninterviewing witnesses and ultimately coauthoring the Baker report.\n  It was a heady experience for the young lawyer and launched him on a \n30-year career in politics. And yet somehow, despite this long and \nintimate exposure to Washington politics, Howard never lost his \noptimism. He never became cynical. He always looked for the good in any \nsituation, and he always kept his good humor. And throughout, he also \nhad the mentorship and friendship of Senator Howard Baker, his first \nboss in politics.\n  During the course of Watergate, Senator Baker and Howard became close \nfriends. As minority leader, Senator Baker hired Howard to be his \nlegislative assistant, and then as majority leader he elevated Howard \nto Sergeant at Arms. Howard would often stay with Senator Baker when \nthe Senator was home in Scott County in Huntsville, TN.\n  Senator Baker tells this delightful story which speaks to their \nfriendship and Howard's charm and his wonderful wit:\n\n       When Howard was Sergeant at Arms in the Senate during the \n     first Reagan inauguration in January 1981, I still have this \n     image of Howard in striped trousers and a cut-away coat \n     standing on a platform next to the emergency phone sweating \n     although the temperature was below freezing. I said: \n     ``Howard, I see you're sweating. Are you OK?'' Howard \n     replied: ``I forgot the key to the emergency phone.''\n\n  Senator Baker asked him later:\n\n       What would you have done if that phone had rung?\n\n  And Howard replied:\n\n       I would have pulled that sucker out by the roots.\n\n  That is Howard Liebengood, and it is the Howard Liebengood we have \nall been pleased to know. He treated everyone, from Senators to \ninterns, with a graciousness and genuine regard. If a constituent had a \ndifficult request or an unusual request, Howard would say: Give them a \nchance. That is an idea that just may be worth considering.\n  When Senator Hatch injured his Achilles' tendon, Howard drove Orrin \nto the Senate every day. While he was my chief of staff, Howard \nLiebengood regularly invited young staffers on summer weekends to \ntravel with him to Baltimore for a day of crabs and baseball.\n  He was just that kind of person--always extending himself, always \nmaking others comfortable around him, always making the personal \nconnection, especially focusing on the young people in the office. He \nwanted to share with them the excitement and honor of working in \nGovernment. He always let them know, interns and staff alike, that \ntheir jobs mattered, that their jobs had a purpose, that they were \nserving their fellow citizens and advancing the cause of democracy.\n  Howard also reached across the aisle. He was known as the peacemaker \nfor his ability to bring opposing sides together. Indeed, one of his \ngreat regrets was what he saw to be the growing partisanship in \npolitics.\n  He missed the days when Members could set aside their party labels \nand share a 6 o'clock cocktail or a Friday night dinner. When he was \nlegislative counsel for Senator Baker, what is now just down the hall \nmy conference room and the leader's office, it was called the ``back \nroom.'' It featured not a conference table but a sofa, a coffee table, \ntwo wingback chairs, and over at the end a wet bar.\n  Howard would host visits that began late in the afternoon and could \nlast well into the evening. The regulars included Mac Mathias, Barry \nGoldwater--they tell me, two fingers of bourbon, no ice--Pete Domenici, \nand Joy Baker, who would often bring along Elizabeth Taylor Warner.\n  Two curious facts about the jovial and mild-mannered Presbyterian. \nThe first, Howard kept a dozen bottles of\n\n[[Page S109]]\n\nhot sauce in his desk drawer. After the 116 Club, the Szechuan Pavilion \nwas one of his favorite restaurants. The second involves his friend, \ngreat friend Mike ``Mad Dog'' Madigan, who served with him on the \nWatergate Committee.\n  The story goes that one time in Manhattan, NY, of all places in the \napartment of Fidel Castro's mistress, in the course of casual \nconversation, Mike Madigan said something that upset Ms. Marita, \nsomething she took as a challenge to her own personal integrity. She \npulled a Derringer from her brassiere and threatened to shoot them \nboth. It was a tense moment. Mike tried to dive under the couch over \nagainst the wall. Fortunately, Mike and Howard got out of there \nunharmed and with a great story to tell.\n  We all greatly admired Howard. When I became majority leader, I \ncalled him on a very late cold December night and asked him to be my \nchief of staff, and to my great, good, wonderful fortune, he said yes, \nand he brought incredible insight and judgment. Through his personal \nleadership, integrity, and generosity, he inspired us all.\n  He valued character. He valued honesty. He valued grace. Above all, \nhe valued faith. Howard was loved and respected by individuals across \nthe Capitol complex from Members to doorkeepers to photographers to the \nhundreds of Senate staffers, old and young, Democrat and Republican. \nHoward was a remarkable person who led a remarkable life.\n  Howard used to sign off his e-mails with the words ``all good \nwishes.'' I know I speak for the entire Senate family when I say our \nhearts are full of good wishes for Howard and his family. We are \nblessed to have had him in our lives, and we will miss him dearly.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before the distinguished Republican leader \nleaves the Senate floor, I wish to express to him through the Chair my \nappreciation for the kind and very thoughtful words about our friend \nHoward.\n  Howard Liebengood represents what the Senate is all about. Spread \nthroughout the Senate, we have hundreds of people who work for us every \nday who are just like him, extremely well educated. If their goal in \nlife was to see how much money they could make, they would not be \nworking here. They do it because they have a sense of public service, \nas indicated with his record.\n  The Senator's kind words about Howard today are words that can be \ndirected to each one of the people who work for us. He was what the \nSenate is all about. He not only should be but is a role model for what \nthe Senate staffers, as we call them, try to be. If they completed \ntheir term of service having given up the fruits of how much money they \ncould make outside the Senate and were thought of as Howard was thought \nof, I believe their lives would be complete.\n  I thank the leader very much. As I said, his remarks not only spoke \nof a good man but are representative of what the Senate is all about.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/24/senate-section/article/S109-1", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S109]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, today we honor the tradition of defining \nour party's agenda for this Congress. I take this duty seriously. \nBecause I take our times seriously.\n  We live during an extraordinary moment not only in the history of \nAmerica, but in the history of the world. And it is my goal--and the \ngoal of my caucus--to look to the future and seize the opportunities \nthat such times offer.\n  Social Security has been one of the great triumphs in the history of \nour government. It has lifted millions of seniors from poverty into \ndignity and provided an essential safety net for disabled citizens.\n  But soon our Social Security system will be unable to sustain itself. \nA program created for security will itself become insecure.\n  Social Security works well for those at or near retirement. And, for \nthese men and women, Social Security must remain the same and provide \nthe same benefits.\n  But for future retirees, the future is less certain. That is, of \ncourse, if we fail to act. Then we will know the outcome: the \nretirement of the baby boom generation will place an unsustainable \nburden on younger Americans.\n  The President is right to call on the Congress to rise to this \ncrisis. I believe we have an opportunity to rise above partisanship, to \ndo what it right rather than what is expedient, and to leave a legacy \nof leadership for our children.\n  This Congress will continue to meet the challenge of our generation, \nto fight and win the war on terror.\n  I would like to thank Chairman Collins for her tremendous leadership \nlast Congress. She successfully completed the first major overhaul of \nour intelligence services in a generation.\n  We will continue to look to her as she undertakes the important task \nof ensuring that we commit our resources where the threat is greatest.\n  Today, we will introduce legislation that honors our service men and \nwomen who have made the supreme sacrifice. They have given all to our \nNation and the cause liberty; and we will give more to better care for \nthe ones they loved.\n  I'm grateful for the hard work of many Senators in this effort, \nparticularly that of Senators Sessions, Hagel, DeWine, Allen, and our \ntwo able chairmen, Senators Warner and Craig.\n  I look forward to their continued contributions on behalf of the \nmembers of our armed services.\n  This bill will also enhance our efforts to secure our Nation against \nbiological threats and gives law enforcement the tools they need to \nbetter defend us at home, both by more quickly providing cutting edge \ntechnologies and by enhancing laws to protect our citizens. I \nappreciate Senator Sessions' leadership in the area of protecting our \nmass transit system against terrorist attacks. Included in this \nleadership proposal is the Railroad Carriers and Mass Transportation \nAct, a bill he authored last Congress and also incorporated into the \nTools to Fight Terrorism Act introduced by Senate leadership.\n  Our Nation's security does not rest on our military might alone. A \ngrowing economy, educational opportunities, and access to affordable \nhealth care are all essential to keep our country strong and our \ncitizens secure.\n  We should begin by examining the Federal Tax Code. Our tax system \nshould raise revenue in a simple, efficient, fair and predictable \nmanner.\n  Unfortunately, this is far from today's reality.\n  Consider the facts: Everyday Americans spend 23 percent more time \nfilling out tax forms today than 8 years ago. In that time, the total \nnumber of pages of Federal tax rules have grown by almost half. And one \nleading tax preparation firm is making 150 percent more money.\n  We look forward to reviewing the findings of the President's Advisory \nPanel on Federal Tax Reform. We will take action. We will simplify our \nlaws, keep our commitment to a progressive Tax Code, and promote \nsavings and growth.\n  Clearly, adopting a comprehensive energy policy and reforming our \ntort system are cornerstones of economic growth. I believe that we have \na real opportunity to work across party lines on these issues.\n  Chairman Domenici has renewed his efforts to bring a bill through the \nEnergy Committee and we look forward to results. The Senate will soon \nbegin its debate on class action reform. It is an important place to \nstart. Our tort system costs our economy nearly $250 billion per year. \nThat's the equivalent of an $844 ``tort tax'' on every American. This \nbill will be an early success. I'm grateful for the hard work on both \nsides of the aisle that have gone into this important initiative.\n  We cannot afford to let lingering concerns about a tax increase on \nsmall businesses stall our economic growth.\n  The President's economic stimulus package was exactly the right \nmedicine at the right time for a faltering economy. From day one it has \nled to steady growth. We need to make those tax cuts permanent so we \ncan keep our economy growing and creating jobs.\n\n[[Page S110]]\n\n  Critical to our long-term competitiveness is an educated and skilled \nworkforce. Chairman Enzi will introduce legislation today grounded in \nessential core principles.\n  We will improve our Federal education and training programs by \nsetting high expectations and raising achievement for all students. We \nwill demand accountability for results. And we will support learning \nopportunities for students at all stages in life.\n  It is time that health care followed the rest of our economy and join \nthe Information Age of the 21st century.\n  Our health care system is a model of spectacular inefficiencies: high \nand rapidly rising health care costs, growing ranks of the uninsured, \nchasms in quality and health care disparities.\n  In order to transform this system, we must agree on a guiding \nprinciple: all Americans deserve the security of lifelong, affordable \naccess to high-quality health care.\n  The focus of a 21st century health care system must be the patient. \nThe system must also be responsive primarily to the consumer, rather \nthan third-party payers. In a transformed system, we must reestablish \nthe doctor-patient relationship, and utilize technology to promote \nefficiency and provide care.\n  I am pleased that we will be introducing legislation that begins to \nbuild on these principles, utilizing the work of Senator Gregg and the \nRepublican Task Force on the Uninsured. We will address rising costs, \nincrease coverage and expand access to care.\n  We are also a Nation that values community, family, and compassion. \nWe will work to build on the success of our welfare laws which have \nhelped over 7 million people move from dependency to the dignity of \nwork.\n  But in doing so, we will recognize the need to support those who do \nthe hard work of compassion--caring for those in need. Our tax \nproposals will support these private efforts while also helping those \nwho are raising children and ending the discrimination against marriage \nin the law.\n  We will also continue our efforts to promote and defend marriage, and \nto support parents as they seek to guide their children in difficult \ntimes. Today, Senator Allard will introduce the marriage protection \namendment which I hope will be sent to the States for ratification.\n  Last Thursday, we had the opportunity to celebrate the enduring value \nof a free people exercising their right to self-governance. But with \neach new political beginning, we have the responsibility to answer to \nthe people we serve. I believe that we have such an opportunity, and I \nhave great faith in my colleagues in the U.S. Senate to dutifully \nanswer that call.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/24/senate-section/article/S110-1", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S110]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in the beginning of each session of \nCongress, the majority and minority introduce their bills. The first 10 \nbills are those of the majority. That is the tradition of the Senate. \nThe distinguished Republican leader has worked hard, as have I, putting \nforward the bills that represent the majority. I have worked hard \nputting forward the bills that represent the minority, and I with \nSenator Durbin, Senator Stabenow, and Senator Schumer today in the \nLyndon Johnson Room presented our bills to the public.\n  The promise of America is a simple one. It is a promise that says if \none works hard and plays by the rules, they can build a stronger, \nbrighter future for themselves and their family. This promise has lived \non for generations in this great country of ours. It is one that I have \nlived personally.\n  As a result of hard work and the generosity of people who helped me \nwith my education, I received a good education, and in the process many \ndoors were opened. After completing my education, I was able to go into \nbusiness and now have what I believe is the best job in the world--a \nMember of the Senate representing the people of the State of Nevada.\n  My story is not unique. As many know, I was born and raised in \nSearchlight. Searchlight represents many places throughout this \ncountry. It represents countless individuals whose lives have been \nblessed, as mine has. I am sorry to say that these stories about a \nyoung boy or girl from a place like Searchlight are becoming fewer and \nfewer. We now have crumbling schools. The average school in America is \n50 years old. We have schools such as those in the southern Nevada \narea, the Las Vegas area, that are being built at a rapid place. As \nmany as 18 in 1 year have to be dedicated to keep up with the growth of \nLas Vegas. The superintendent of public education has become a \nsuperintendent of public construction. School districts need help with \ntheir schools, in inner cities and in rural communities.\n  Good-paying jobs are giving way to jobs that, no matter how hard one \nworks, just don't pay the bills. There are 45 million people without \nhealth care. That means there are too many Americans who are not \ngetting the care they need to live healthy and prosperous lives.\n  This is the America we live in today, a country whose founding \npromise is slipping further away from reality for far too many American \nfamilies, a country where a kid like me from Searchlight finds it \nharder to get ahead, despite the generosity of people in the community, \nthe good will of teachers, and a work ethic, which is important.\n  Why do we find ourselves in this state today? Why is the promise of \nAmerica, the promise that led me and others to this great Chamber, not \nstill alive and well for all of us? In part, it is because we have a \nGovernment that simply does not live up to the values upon which the \npromise was made. We have leaders whose poor planning and mismanagement \nhave sent young men and women into battle overseas, some say without \nthe equipment and support they deserve to succeed in the battlefield.\n  Some way, and I certainly underscore this, there was a plan to win \nthe war but not a plan to win the peace. We have a Government that by \nany measure fails to do all it can to make our country safe and secure. \nWe have leaders who love to create crises when they do not exist, such \nas Social Security, which will be funded for many decades into the \nfuture, some say as far as the year 2055.\n\n  Some say there is a crisis with judges. This morning someone asked: \nWhat happens if you do to President Bush this next 4 years what you did \nthe first 4? I say, well, he should jump with joy. That would mean 408 \njudges he would get approved and 20 disapproved.\n  The Constitution has in it a clause that deals with advise and \nconsent. If the oath I took just a few weeks ago to uphold the \nConstitution means anything, certainly that part of the oath that says \nI must live up to the Constitution, it says the Senate of the United \nStates has an obligation, legal in nature, to give advice and consent \nto the President of his nominations. I will continue to do that. I \nbelieve that is a role we have.\n  There are real crises. I have talked about some of them. I talked \nabout others: education, health care, the environment that we do not \ntalk about much anymore. Energy is a crisis we have in this country. \nThe staggering deficit we have developed these past 4 years is a \ncrisis. I believe there are real crises that are crippling our economy, \nhurting the large and small businesses, and pricing too many families \nout of quality health care. That is what our legislation we introduce \ntoday deals with. We have a Government that has forgotten who it is \nresponsible to, one that has become content with feeding tens of \nbillions to the special interests while failing in its commitment to \ntens of millions of seniors.\n  America's promise will not stay alive if America's Government betrays \nit, and that is why at the outset of this Congress Senate Democrats are \ncommitted to restoring the promise of America by pursuing an agenda \nthat honors the values behind it, the values of security, opportunity, \nand responsibility. These values are at the core of America's promise.\n  The ten Democratic bills which I will introduce today deal first with \nAmerica's security. For example, we need to work to increase our \nSpecial Operations Forces by 2,000 individuals. We need to expand the \npace and scope of programs to eliminate and safeguard nuclear materials \nand enhance efforts to prevent radioactive and other deadly\n\n[[Page S111]]\n\nmaterials from entering the United States. That is Nunn-Lugar. We must \ndo more than what we have done with the Nunn-Lugar legislation.\n  We must increase our military. Our legislation calls for an increase \nby 40,000--30,000 in the Army and 10,000 in the Marines--so that we \nhave enough troops to win the peace in Iraq and fight terrorism around \nthe world without extending tours of duty to the breaking point.\n  We will create a Guard and Reserve bill of rights to protect and \npromote the interests of our dedicated citizen soldiers and fight for \nthe families of those who serve to recognize the sacrifices they have \nmade. S. 13 will fulfill our duty to America's veterans. It will ensure \nthat all veterans get the health care and prescription drugs they \ndeserve while also expanding the availability and accessibility of \nmental health care. We will ensure that no veteran is forced to choose \nbetween a retirement and disability check, and launch a 21st century GI \nbill that tells soldiers of today that we will help them to succeed \nwhen they return, just as we did for those great heroes who returned \nfrom World War II, Korea, and Vietnam.\n\n  We need to expand opportunities to all Americans, and economic \nopportunity is going to be extended through S. 14. We, for example, \nwill end tax incentives that encourage companies to ship jobs overseas. \nWe are going to restore overtime rights for 6 million workers who lost \nthat guarantee last year.\n  S. 15 will help us with education. It must be a cornerstone of equal \nopportunity. Democrats will keep our promise to our children by \nincreasing support for preschool education, fully funding No Child Left \nBehind and making sure it is implemented the right way. We will address \nthe shortfall of math, science, and special education teachers by \ncreating tuition incentives for college students to major in these \nfields, and we will work to make sure every American who wants it can \nafford 4 years of college with new tuition tax credits and relief from \nburdensome loans.\n  There are problems in rural school districts in Kansas, Nevada, \nIllinois, Nebraska and Utah. I have found, in my travels through rural \nNevada, one of the biggest problems the school districts in rural \nNevada have is school buses. That might not seem like much in the \noverall scheme of things, but it is rare for a bus in Nevada rural \nschools to be new. They buy used, old buses. Most of the buses are worn \nout before they get them. We could help rural America in lots of \ndifferent ways, but we could help rural America so much if we provided \na way where they could buy new buses. We need to do that. When school \ndistricts have these old buses, children have no choice but to ride in \noutdated, unsafe buses. That is why we will create a Federal program to \nhelp rural school districts purchase new buses that will get kids to \nschool in a reliable and safe manner.\n  S. 16 will make sure health care is more affordable to families and \nbusinesses. We know health care costs have spiraled. That is why we \nwill bring down the price of prescription drugs by legalizing safe \nimportation of FDA-approved prescription drugs from industrialized \ncountries. We will also ensure that every child in America has access \nto health care and that every pregnant woman in America can get the \nmaternity care she needs and deserves. We will reduce health care costs \nby creating incentives to modernize health care and by offering tax \ncredits to small businesses.\n  Finally, we want to build a government that meets its \nresponsibilities both to Americans today and in the future. S. 18 will \nhelp America's seniors. Medicare should work for seniors, not the HMOs \nand drug companies. First we will eliminate the provision that actually \nprohibits Medicare from using the negotiating power of its 41 million \nbeneficiaries to get lower prices. The Medicare bill has a provision in \nit that says Medicare cannot negotiate for lower prices. They have to \ngo to Rite Aid and other places, just like the rest of us. They cannot \ncompete with the HMOs which can buy their drugs in bulk.\n  We will eliminate the giveaways like the $10 billion slush funds for \nhospitals in the Medicare bill. We will improve the prescription drug \nbenefit by phasing out the current donut hole where seniors pay a \npremium but get no credit. Seniors across the country were shocked by \nthe record increase in Medicare Part B premiums this year. This must be \naddressed. We must be a government that honors its responsibilities to \nfuture generations. We have had reckless spending these last 4 years. \nIt has turned record surpluses into record deficits and has mortgaged \nour children's future. It is long past time for Washington to return to \nthe same commonsense budget that families use around the kitchen table \nevery day, and that is why we will call for pay-as-you-go budgeting.\n\n  Our final bill, S. 20, will support women in making responsible \nchoices about their health. The United States has the highest rate of \nunintended pregnancies among all industrialized nations. Half of all \npregnancies in this country are unintended and nearly half of those end \nin abortion. By increasing access to family planning services, \nDemocrats will improve women's health, reduce the rate of unintended \npregnancies, and reduce the number of abortions, all while saving \nscarce public health dollars.\n  Security, opportunity, and responsibility--these are more than just \nthree words or three values. They are the foundation on which America's \npromise is built. Senate Democrats open the 109th Congress steadfastly \ncommitted to keeping this promise alive, so that all Americans who work \nhard can build a stronger and brighter future for their families. While \nthese 10 bills do not represent all the goals of the 109th Congress, \nthey represent the start and the core of our mission.\n  No doubt we will tackle many other important issues before Congress \ncloses, but we will never lose sight of the values for which we fight \nand the promises we must keep.\n  For instance, when it comes to strengthening Social Security, \nDemocrats will keep America's promise. The program is our bargain that \nsays those who work hard and pay their taxes have earned a secure \nretirement. Our values compel us to keep the promise of security to our \nseniors, and Senate Democrats will do this. We will not irresponsibly \ncut benefits or jeopardize the opportunity of future generations with \n$2 trillion in new debt. This is keeping America's promise, and that is \nwhat Senate Democrats will do.\n  In closing, I would like to say a few words to my colleagues across \nthe aisle. We hope and believe many Republicans share our view that we \nmust not allow partisanship to stand in the way of America's promise, \nor let politics get in the way of keeping alive the American dream. \nThat is our pledge. We will work with the majority in meeting the \ndemands of America.\n  I recognize the first 30 minutes of morning business time was that of \nthe majority. How much time did I use?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator used 14\\1/2\\ \nminutes.\n  Mr. REID. I apologize to my friends on the other side of the aisle. \nTen minutes of that will be leader time. The rest Senator Durbin will \nuse for whatever he feels appropriate when our time comes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise, as was noted, to recognize and pay \ntribute to and remember our dear friend Howard Liebengood. I thought \nthe majority leader's comments concerning Howard Liebengood could have \nbeen recited by any and all who knew him. My friendship with Howard \nLiebengood goes back almost 30 years. When I first became acquainted \nwith Howard and his wife Dee, we would bet on the Kansas State-Nebraska \nfootball game every year. I know the Presiding Officer has a passing \ninterest in that game. Howard, each year, would come back for more. \nThese were the days when Kansas State had not defeated Nebraska for \nmany years. But one of the extraordinary parts of this extraordinary \nman was an optimism, not only about Kansas State football but about \nlife. All that he touched, all he represented, and all who knew him \nwere uplifted by this gentleman, this man who always put his friends \nfirst.\n  I recall when Howard and Dee's children were young, I would \noccasionally go to their home in Vienna for a little chili cookoff. It \nwas not a big group; it was just us. Howard always had the remarkable \nability to reach beyond his professional capacity. After all, we are \nall judged and will be judged by that dynamic at the end of our lives. \nIt will not be for whatever professional accomplishments we have but it \nwill be for what we have done for others and how we are remembered by \nothers, as was noted by the majority leader in his remarks.\n  So, today, as I and others rise on behalf of Howard Liebengood, we \ncelebrate his life and his family and all the light that he brought to \nso many of us for so long. This dear, dear man, we will miss greatly. \nBut he does leave the world better than he found it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Utah is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have to say that Howard Liebengood was \none of my dear friends and I think he was a dear friend to virtually \neverybody in the Senate on both sides of the aisle. What a good man.\n  What can I say about Howard Liebengood? That he was a loving, caring \nfamily man who placed his lovely wife, Deanna, and their wonderful \nchildren, Howie, John, and Ann, above all else? That he was the \nconsummate Capitol insider, who managed to retain humility and kindness \nwhile rising to the pinnacle of Washington's power structure? That he \nwas an accomplished lawyer, businessman, and military hero who never \nforgot his small-town roots in this often heartless big town? That he \nwas a man of faith, whose church was a source of strength in the \nhardest of times?\n  I can say all of these things--and more.\n  I have been proud and humbled to call Howard Liebengood a friend. He \nwas a trusted adviser to me and so many other Senators. He was my \nneighbor in Virginia, and we often drove to work together. When I had \nmy Achilles' tendon rupture--completely severed my tendon--Howard and I \nrode together every day. Those were some of the most wonderful times \nI've had.\n  We shared some wonderful times; I always looked forward to his keen \nobservations and his wry good wit and very strong intelligence.\n  I knew what many in this body knew about Howard, that we could always \ncount on him to listen, and care, and act--not in his own self-\ninterest, but for the greater good.\n\n  Howard was so successful in our world, yet he was never driven by \nmoney, fame or desire.\n  His many accomplishments--the Bronze Star, his work in the Senate on \nthe Watergate Committee, as our Sergeant at Arms, as Chief of Staff to \ntwo of our greatest Senators--tell volumes about Howard, but they do \nnot reveal the inner peace and calm that made him such a wonderful, \nwonderful part of this institution, a tribute to all that is good in \npublic service.\n  What more can you ask in a man?\n  Nothing.\n  Howard did it all.\n  Howard had it all.\n  His loss is so great. Our loss is so great. This body will mourn his \nloss for so many years to come.\n  I know all here today join in sending both our deepest sympathies to \nthe Liebengood family, and our profound admiration for Howard S. \nLiebengood--husband, father and trusted public servant. I knew him \npersonally very well. He was kind. He was considerate. He was helpful. \nHe was always down the middle. He was someone to rely on.\n  Let us celebrate his life today and all that was so good in this man, \neven as we mourn Howard S. Liebengood's tragic passing at too early a \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Tennessee is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, last week Howard Liebengood's best friend, former \nSenator Fred Thompson, spoke eloquently about his life with Howard over \nthe last 30 years since their time at Vanderbilt Law School. Marty \nGold, whom all of us know, spoke about Howard Liebengood in a little \ndifferent way. The majority leader spoke about him today in still a \ndifferent way from the experience he had with him in the last few years \nand especially the last 2 as his chief of staff. Senator Hagel and \nSenator Hatch had something to say, and many others will. So the \nquestion might be, What could I add to these eloquent words? What I can \nadd today are some of Howard's own words.\n  Howard spent the last 2 years doing something that is very special in \nthe Senate. He and my chief of staff Tom Ingram had lunch every week, \nand their stated objective, among all the other things, was to make \nsure the Frist staff and the Alexander staff didn't compete with each \nother but worked together to serve the people of Tennessee.\n  That may sound to people outside the Senate like the way it always \nis, but that is not always easy to do. But I think it is fair to say--\nand a lot of this credit goes to the majority leader because of his \nattitude and his generous spirit and his unselfishness--our staff \nworked beautifully together for 2 years. We haven't competed with each \nother. That is because of the spirit of Howard Liebengood.\n  As a result, we invited him last September to our staff retreat. We \nwanted many of the staff members--some of whom are the age of his \nchildren or even younger--to hear from him how he views this Senate \nwhich was his home really for 30 years, why he loves it so much, and \nwhy he conducted himself the way he did in a world that is supposed to \nbe cynical or cutthroat and competitive, where you take yours and the \nother guy gets his. That wasn't Howard Liebengood at all.\n  I have a copy of the notes Howard used for that evening. He went on \nfor about an hour, and the staff members told me they wished he had \ngone on for 2 or 3 hours. He told stories about law school. He told \nstories about Fred Thompson, the Intelligence Committee, and about \nHoward Baker--many of the incidents which Senator Frist talked about. \nBut when he came to the end of his remarks, he said this. I believe \nperhaps the most important thing I can contribute to this discussion \nhonoring our friend Howard is his own words about why he came and why \nhe stayed in the Senate. He concluded his remarks to our staff last \nOctober saying this: ``I came for a year.''\n  This is when Bill Frist asked him to come back.\n  ``And I stayed two.''\n  He said, ``It is hard for me to leave the labor of love that is for \nme the U.S. Senate, the institution herself, in every way. From the \npeople to the protocol and the opportunity to serve the people of \nTennessee, I have relished every moment. How blessed I have been,'' \nHoward Liebengood told these young staff members, ``throughout my life \nto have these exciting assignments, these remarkable colleagues, \nspectacular leaders, and challenging work--never a dull moment. I am \nforever grateful to Fred Thompson for bringing me here and to Howard \nBaker for keeping me here and being my personal inspiration, to the \nincomparable Bill\n\n[[Page S113]]\n\nFrist, whom I admire and enjoy working with, and to my other friends \nwith whom I have served. And finally I thank each of you for having me \nwith you tonight.''\n  The parting thoughts Howard Liebengood said to my staff last \nSeptember were these: ``Always be true to yourself. Trust your best \ninstincts. Serve humbly and unselfishly. Distinguished Senator for whom \nyou work and Tennessee at every turn. Relish your time here. Take pride \nin your work, but never be haughty. Look out for your colleagues at \nevery turn. And walk with the Lord.''\n  He concluded: ``With that formula my experience suggests that both \nWashington and life will treat you very well. Thank you for having me \nwith you this evening.''\n  I think all of us would say today that Howard treated Washington and \nlife very well, and we are grateful that he came our way.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, are there further tributes to Mr. \nLiebengood?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I hope to say a few words about Howard \nLiebengood.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Kentucky is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I listened carefully to Senator \nAlexander's observations about our good friend, Howard Liebengood. I \nfirst met Howard as he was leaving the Senate. I came here the year \nSenator Baker retired, and Howard was on the way out. I wasn't sure \nthat I would get to know him because everybody even before I got here--\nit seemed like everybody I ran into--knew Howard Liebengood. He was \npart of this institution. He was on the way out as Senator Baker left.\n  In thinking about the last 20 years--that was 20 years ago--Howard \nLiebengood really never left the Senate. He was always in this town \navailable as a resource to all of us. I called upon him frequently over \nthe entire period when he was technically not working at the Senate but \nwas in town and providing his good advice to anyone who would ask.\n  I say to my friend, the junior Senator from Tennessee, and to the \nmajority leader, you were lucky that Howard Liebengood was from \nTennessee. I wish he had been from Kentucky. He was a wonderful man and \na great part of this institution that we will not soon forget.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to speak in memory of Howard \nLiebengood, who passed away on January 13. The majority and minority \nleaders and other Members of this body have already spoken in Howard's \nmemory. In addition to associating myself with their remarks, I would \nlike to offer a few brief words of reflection on behalf of myself and \nmy wife Jackie, who knew Howard well through her work for Senator Jake \nGarn of Utah.\n  As someone who essentially grew up in this institution, I have always \nhad a great deal of respect and affection for the United States Senate. \nWhile some today may dismiss the notion as quaint, I continue to regard \nthe Senate as a family--one where personal friendships can transcend \nideological beliefs, and one that in its finest moments can rise above \nparty differences to truly make a difference in the lives of the people \nwhom we serve. It is in that spirit that I speak today in memory of \nHoward--a vital and well-respected member of this family for over 3 \ndecades.\n  Howard served here in a number of capacities--as minority counsel to \nthe Watergate Committee in the 1970's, where he worked closely with \nSenator Howard Baker; as Sergeant at Arms from 1981 to 1983; and \nfinally, as chief of staff to Senator Fred Thompson and majority leader \nBill Frist. He also maintained his relationship with the Senate for \nmany years working in Government relations for a variety of clients.\n  I came to know Howard in 1981 when I entered this body as a freshman \nSenator, and he began his term as Sergeant at Arms. I gained an \nimmediate and lasting appreciation for Howard--not only as Sergeant at \nArms, but as a human being.\n  The Sergeant at Arms in the Senate is a position that encompasses \nenormous responsibilities--from security, to printing and graphics, to \ntechnology, to recording, to financial operations. To put it quite \nsimply, the day-to-day business here in the United States Senate \ndepends on the Office of the Sergeant at Arms, and on the service of \npeople like Howard.\n  Howard Liebengood was a man who loved this institution and who loved \nour country--and that love was reflected in the way he approached his \nwork. Howard was a good and decent man whose humor, calm, and patience \nwere well-known to all of us who were fortunate to know him. He was an \nindividual who worked well with Senators and staff from both parties. \nHoward always impressed me as someone who cared more about the Senate, \nand the role it plays in our democracy, than he did about advancing any \nparticular party's agenda. In all the positions he occupied in the \nSenate, he always cared deeply about the things that unite us as \nAmericans, rather than those that divide us along partisan political \nlines. He understood that the strength of the Senate as an institution \nand its significance in shaping our history reside in the ability of \nits Members to reconcile differences for the good of our Nation.\n  This institution and our Nation are indebted to Howard for his years \nof service. I offer my deepest sympathies to Howard's wife Dee and \ntheir three children.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the distinguished \nmajority leader, Mr. Frist, as a cosponsor of his resolution honoring \nthe memory of Howard Liebengood.\n  Howard was a good friend of mine and a very trustworthy officer of \nthe U.S. Senate. I first go to know him when he worked as a member of \nthe staff of the Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Baker.\n  He later served as Sergeant at Arms and Doorkeeper when Senator Baker \nwas the Republican leader.\n  It was my pleasure to know Howard's family as well. His wife Deanna \nwas a very important asset and an admired and respected member of the \nSenate family.\n  We will miss Howard's ready smile and his keen insight on the issues \nfacing our country. He was truly a wonderful person and a loyal friend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the tributes \nto Mr. Liebengood have been taken from the morning business time \nallotted to the Republican side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. How much time is remaining on each side in morning \nbusiness?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 17 minutes on the majority side and \n25 minutes on the minority side.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Collins be \nrecognized on the Republican morning business side, and I will follow \nher with the remaining time on the Democratic side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The distinguished Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank my colleague from \nIllinois for his courtesy.\n  (The remarks of Ms. Collins pertaining to the submission of S. Res. 8 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Submitted Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I didn't know Mr. Liebengood, but I \nlistened closely to the tributes made today. He clearly was an \nextraordinary person who touched the hearts of many in the United \nStates on both sides of the aisle. There are so many like him who give \na great contribution to this institution. I hope when the time comes \nthey will receive the same memorial and tributes as Mr. Liebengood \nreceived today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. It is my understanding on the Democratic side we have 25 \nminutes remaining in morning business; on the Republican side, how much \ntime remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 5 minutes remaining on the Republican \nside.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/24/senate-section/article/S114-1", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S114-S116]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S114]]\n                     SCHEDULE OF THE 109TH CONGRESS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, this is a critical day in the schedule \ncalendar of the Senate. For those who follow the ebb and flow of \nbusiness in the Senate, this is the kickoff, the tip-off, the first \npitch. This is the week when we start rolling up our sleeves to get \ndown to business.\n  Traditionally, the leaders on both sides, Republican and Democrat, \nannounce their priorities, what they would like to see as the \nlegislative accomplishments of this session. I am certain the list \nannounced today by Senator Frist and Senator Reid are not exhaustive. \nThere are many issues that were not included on either list that will \ncertainly be discussed.\n  However, I think it is interesting what we find when we compare the \ntwo lists. On the Republican side, the No. 1 priority, the highest \nlegislative priority from Senator Frist, is what is termed the Social \nSecurity Solvency and Protection Act.\n  On the Democratic side, we have a different approach. Our first \npriority is the title of ``putting America's security first, standing \nwith our troops.''\n  Both of these legislative proposals address important issues. No one \nargues that the Social Security system should not be carefully watched \nand that we should not address the law and change it from time to time. \nHowever, it is interesting that both President Bush and the Republican \nleaders in the Senate have decided the highest priority for this \nsession is Social Security.\n  The reason why I find it interesting is that they prefaced this \ndecision by saying we are facing a crisis in Social Security. Some use \nthose terms. The President himself has called it a problem. Some have \ncalled it a challenge. But whatever your characterization, it is clear \nthat the White House believes this is the issue that should come first \nof all issues that Congress might consider.\n  If we did nothing to Social Security, if we made no change whatsoever \nin the law--didn't change a comma, a semicolon, put a period at the end \nof the sentence, nothing in the law--Social Security would continue to \npay out to over 47 million Americans every payment with a cost of \nliving adjustment for 37 years from today. There is not another program \nin the Government that you can say the same thing about. There is no \nother program that you can say with any certainty is funded to be in \nexistence 37 years from today.\n  Most other programs depend on the Appropriations Committee and the \nwill of Congress and the leadership of the President for funding. \nSocial Security, left untouched, is on track for 37 years of solvency. \nWhy? Because in the early 1980s, leaders in Congress took a look at the \nSocial Security system and said: We have a problem. The problem is, \nreturning GIs from World War II, anxious to start their families, had a \nlot of babies in a hurry, the so-called baby boom generation. Those \nkids, first born after 1945, will reach retirement age and start \nshowing up and asking for their Social Security checks. By our \nprojection, we will not have enough money.\n  So in the mid-1980s, President Ronald Reagan, a leading Republican, \ncame up to Capitol Hill, met with the House Democratic Speaker, ``Tip'' \nO'Neill, the leading Democrat of the day, and said: Can we come \ntogether and agree on a plan that will make sure Social Security is \ngoing to be able to handle the baby boomers. They sat down and went \ninto a lengthy negotiation, a commission, debate, a study, and came up \nwith a proposal. The net result of that proposal was to change the \nSocial Security law in the early 1980s to make certain that Social \nSecurity would have a bright future.\n  In 1983, we passed this law which bought 53 years of solvency for the \nSocial Security system. So we can say for more than half a century \nSocial Security will be running in the black and not in the red.\n  What changes did we make? Some involve benefits, some taxes. Some \nwere controversial; some were not.\n  When it is all said and done, we did the right thing. We took a \nprogram that was about 50 years old and gave it over 50 more years of \nlife by reaching a bipartisan decision that would give to Social \nSecurity that bright future. That is what happened in the mid-1980s.\n  Now comes the President and his Republican friends in Congress \nsaying: Stop; we have a crisis on our hands in Social Security. If we \ndo not do something, and do it today, if we do not make dramatic \nchanges in Social Security, it will not be there to pay the workers of \ntomorrow.\n  That overlooks the obvious. The Social Security Board takes a close \nlook at the system and they tell us what we did in the mid-1980s still \nworks today. We have at least 37 more years of solvency in Social \nSecurity. So there is no immediate crisis.\n  Is there a challenge? Yes, because in 2042, we have to change the law \nso that it brings in more money or in some way is handled in a \ndifferent fashion so more people are covered. So 37 years from now, we \nhave a challenge.\n  Can we do things today to address that challenge? You bet we can. We \ncan make modest and commonsense changes in Social Security that will \ngive it 20, 30 more years of life. That is a responsible thing to do.\n  Listen to what the White House is proposing that we do with Social \nSecurity. It is not a question of a modest commonsense change. It is a \ndramatic and some would say radical change in Social Security. What the \nWhite House is proposing is that we partially privatize Social \nSecurity. In other words, the workers who are paying into Social \nSecurity, instead of paying 6.2 percent of their earnings, would pay \nless--perhaps 4 percent of their earnings and then take the other 2 \npercent and put it into privatized accounts--into the stock market, \nmutual funds, something of that nature. The argument from the \nPresident's supporters is that this would mean they have ownership of \ntheir future because they are investing their own money.\n\n  There are several things on which the President has not given the \ndetails. By most calculations, taking money out of Social Security for \nprivatization, partial or otherwise, means cutting the benefits of \nSocial Security retirees. How can you take the money out of the system \nthat we planned on using to pay retirees for the next 37 years without \ncutting those benefits? And, if you do not cut the benefits, how do you \nmake up the difference? Some estimate the privatization of Social \nSecurity will cost us $2 trillion in the first 10 years.\n  Questions have been asked. I was at a meeting where questions were \nasked of the President: How will we pay for the $2 trillion? The \nargument is, we will add it to the national debt, the largest increase \nin the national debt in the history of the United States to privatize \nSocial Security. Is that what we are bargaining for?\n  A lot of people have said if you increase the national debt, it means \nthe United States has to borrow more money. Where do we borrow money? \nWe borrow money from Japan and China and Korea, countries that not only \nlend us money for our debt but then expect us to buy more of their \nproducts in return.\n  So when you look at the imports coming into the United States from \nall over the world, they are coming in largely from countries that are \nbuying our debt. So $2 trillion more in debt for future generations, $2 \ntrillion more in foreign products coming into the United States. Lord \nonly knows what it means to the future of our economy and jobs going \nout of the United States.\n  As you can see, this is a complicated issue and it is an issue that \nwill be the subject of a long debate.\n  This is what I think. If privatizing Social Security means cutting \nbenefits for the retirees in the future, if it means adding $2 trillion \nto the national debt to be paid for by future generations, it is not a \ngood bargain. But it is the No. 1 priority of the Republicans in the \nSenate.\n  In fairness to the Republican leadership and to the President, we \nwant to see the proposal. We want to see what the President is actually \nasking for. There have been a lot of press conferences. The President \nhas ads on television now. He has been visiting different cities \ntalking about privatization of Social Security. But we need to see the \nlaw.\n\n  What we think, though, is if you want a real crisis in America you \ncan find it, a crisis that deserves our immediate attention. Allow me \nto start with\n\n[[Page S115]]\n\nhealth care. In the last few years--in fact, in the last 4 years--we \nhave seen a dramatic increase in the number of uninsured Americans. \nSince President Bush took office, we have increased the number of \nuninsured Americans, those without health insurance, from 40 to 45 \nmillion. And the cost of health care has skyrocketed in America.\n  What is being done by this administration, by this Congress, to deal \nwith the skyrocketing cost of health care? Virtually nothing. Why? \nBecause in order to tackle this issue, you have to acknowledge the \nobvious. The market forces are at work, and the market forces are \nkilling us.\n  The cost of health insurance continues to go up every year; the \ncoverage goes down. Fewer and fewer people can afford it. Businesses \nare seeing these costs skyrocket, and they cannot be profitable because \nof these costs or they have to cut off health insurance. That is the \nreality.\n  The business leaders I speak to in Illinois, large and small, all \ntell me the cost of health insurance is the No. 1 crisis they are \nfacing. Why isn't that on the list of the Republican leadership, to \ndeal with the cost of health insurance and this health care crisis?\n  We believe on the Democratic side, and have a legislative proposal, \nto give tax credits to small businesses that do the right thing, that \nprotect their employees with health insurance. That, to me, is a good \ntax reform. It accomplishes exactly what we want. It strengthens small \nbusiness, the No. 1 generator of jobs in America, and helps them when \nthey do the right and responsible thing by covering their employees. \nThere are a lot of tax cuts people are talking about. You have heard a \nlot of talk on this floor about them. But this is one that makes \neminent sense.\n  We also need to do something with the related issue of the cost of \nprescription drugs. A lot of people, including the Governor of my \nState, have proposed that we import drugs from Canada. Why in the world \nwould this great country of ours be dependent on a smaller country, an \nimportant but smaller country, Canada, for our prescription drugs?\n  It is because, frankly, we are not importing prescription drugs from \nCanada. We are importing political leadership.\n  The Canadian Government had the political will and courage to stand \nup to American drug companies and tell them they could not continue to \ndramatically increase the cost of drugs for sale to Canadians every \nsingle year. The American drug companies said: All right, then we \nwon't. But this Government and this Congress will not stand up to those \nsame drug companies. As a result, costs skyrocket in America, and they \nare half that cost in Canada.\n  We believe until this Government and this administration have the \npolitical will to represent the American consumers and bring prices \ndown, we have no choice but to turn to Canada and other sources of \nreimported, safe American drugs. We support that.\n  We also believe we need to monitor drugs more carefully. How many \ntimes have we heard the news in the last several weeks about the Food \nand Drug Administration discovering that a drug that had been for sale \nin the United States for a long period of time is unsafe, taken from \nthe market? You have heard it, as I have, time and again. We make \ncertain that drug approvals in this country are going to be handled in \na way that will give consumers confidence in what they are buying.\n  The second issue is the one of education. Many of us voted for No \nChild Left Behind, the President's premier education program, expecting \nthat once we identified the problems in American schools, we would \nprovide the resources to deal with them. It did not happen. President \nBush and the leadership in Congress refused to fund, to the authorized \namount, No Child Left Behind, which meant that schools that were \nfalling behind did not have money for smaller class sizes, for \nafterschool programs, summer programs, and tutoring. As a result, \nhaving identified the problems, we walked away from them.\n\n  We believe on the Democratic side that funding education across \nAmerica is our highest priority. I just heard the Senator from Maine \ntalk about Pell grants. I could not agree with her more. Pell grants \nare the way a lot of kids have a chance to get a college education. You \nknow the story. Kids work hard in school. They graduate from college \nwith $10,000, $20,000, $30,000, $40,000, $50,000, $60,000, $70,000 or \n$80,000 of debt, and these kids turn to the marketplace and say: I have \nto take the best paying job, if I can find one.\n  Pell grants mean students do not have to borrow as much money. The \nnew rules from the Bush administration, just released, means fewer Pell \ngrants will be available. In Illinois, 48,000 students will see their \nPell grants cut because of the Bush administration proposals. And 1,450 \nwill lose them entirely. That is not the way to encourage young people \nto pursue the education of their dreams, to prepare themselves for the \n21st century.\n  We also believe, and Senator Schumer has been a leader on this issue, \nthat families ought to have the tax deductibility of college education \nexpenses. You can deduct the interest on your mortgage. Why? Because we \nwant to encourage home ownership. Why wouldn't we say to families, you \ncan deduct college education expenses so as to encourage your son or \ndaughter to achieve their dreams with higher education? That is another \ntype of tax reform which I think is very positive.\n  When it comes to economic opportunity, we believe we need to have a \nFederal minimum wage increase. The majority of workers on minimum wage \nare women, and the majority of those are women raising small families \nin a household that may or may not have a husband present. They are \nmaking great sacrifices, sometimes holding down two jobs. And for over \n7 years, this administration has resisted, first in Congress, now in \nthe Presidency, increasing the minimum wage. Try to live on the minimum \nwage as you know it today. It is virtually impossible. We think work \ndeserves our dignified respect and deserves a dignified wage. We favor \nincreasing the minimum wage.\n  We also want to deal with the exporting of American jobs overseas. \nLou Dobbs talks about this all the time. You know what is happening. \nGood-paying manufacturing jobs are leaving America. Why are they going \noverseas? Well, sadly, our Tax Code rewards companies that send jobs \noverseas. That is wrong.\n  Secondly, we are not calling in the trade police on the countries \nthat are violating trade practices and trade treaties. So when China \nmanipulates its currency so it puts American businesses out of business \nand workers on the street, we do not hold them accountable.\n  The Democrats believe that should be a legislative priority. If we \nare going to have good jobs for our workers and those coming out of \ncollege, we have to stand up and fight for the jobs that are leaving \nAmerica. That is a critical element.\n  Let me add to that list. I said at a press conference today, and I \nbelieve it, the political tsunami that is about to hit us in the United \nStates relates to pensions and health care for retirees. Think about \nhow many people in America worked a lifetime believing if they paid out \nof every paycheck a certain amount of money, that when they retired \nthey would have a private pension plan taking care of them--thousands \nand thousands of Americans.\n  What is happening today? Those companies are going bankrupt. Those \ncompanies are in a position where they are trying to restructure and \nwalk away from their pension requirements, walk away from health care \nretirements. The system we have set up in this country is not adequate \nto the task. So if we want to make certain these Americans have the \nretirement they planned on, we need real leadership here in Congress.\n\n  The last issue I will mention today has to do with reforming voting \nin America. I think the last election was better than the one before, \nnot in the outcome--I saw that differently--but in the way it was \nhandled. Yet in the State of Ohio, in my State of Illinois, in States \naround the Nation, voters walked to the polling place and many of them \nran into obstacles they should not run into. We ought to make voting \neasier in America.\n  When an American citizen does the right thing and goes out to vote, \nwe ought to say they are going to have a consistent law, a consistent \nstandard applied to them, whether they live in Ohio, Illinois, Florida, \nNevada, or the\n\n[[Page S116]]\n\nState of Washington. I think that is something we can do and should do.\n  Madam President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, I would like to close on this note: There is a lot \nof discussion here, starting with the President's inaugural, about the \nwhole concept of an ownership society. I think this is going to be the \ndriving philosophy and the driving political force behind the \nRepublican agenda. The concept is alluring because the concept says: \nWouldn't you want to control your own future? Wouldn't you like to own \nyour future as opposed to depending on the Government? You cannot be \ncertain that Congress and the Government will come through for you. So \nwouldn't you rather own your own future?\n  Boy, that has a lot of appeal, particularly to young people who feel \ninvincible, that just given a chance: Let me take the money, let me \ninvest for my future, let me make these decisions. That is not a bad \nquality. It is an independence that we encourage in individuals, and it \nis certainly one that I support. But we should not overlook the \nobvious.\n  At the heart of the ownership society is the basic belief that we \nshould just remember that when it comes to America, we are all in this \nalone. I do not think that is true. I think history tells us that \nstanding alone there are some things we can do but other things we \ncannot do.\n  If you want to be successful in America, you need good health. Can \nyou control your own fate when it comes to health care? Only if the \nsystem treats you fairly. If you happen to be somebody with a \npreexisting condition and no insurance company will offer you coverage, \nyou are not likely to be treated fairly. If you happen to be one who \ncomes from a family with some history of mental illness, you will find \nrank discrimination by hospitalization insurance companies right now.\n  The point I am making is this: We have decided that to make certain \npeople have a chance in America to succeed when it comes to health \ncare, there will be rules of the game, there will be laws in States, \nand laws in the Federal Government and agencies to enforce them. \nOwnership? Yes. To have ownership of your future, you need good health \ncare. To have good health care, you need to have a government standing \nbehind you and protecting your right to fair treatment when it comes to \nhealth care.\n  How about education? Do you want to go it alone with the ownership \nsociety? Well, you may need a Pell grant to get through school. I \nborrowed money from the National Defense Education Act to get through \ncollege and law school. Students find, over and over again, were it not \nfor Government programs, they might not be able to go to school. You \nwant to own your future? Then you need to have leadership at the \nFederal, State, and local level to give you the chance to borrow the \nmoney.\n  What about your pension that you spend a lifetime paying into, \nbelieving you own that? That is not Government. I own that. And then \nthe company disappears or walks away from its obligation to you. What \nfighting chance do you have? None, unless there is a law that protects \nyou and an agency that will enforce that law.\n  So when you hear this alluring prospect of an ownership society, \nunderstand we value individual freedom on both sides of the aisle, but \nwe also understand that in many instances the strength of our Nation is \nwhen we stand together--for fairness when it comes to health care, for \nopportunity when it comes to education, to have protection when it \ncomes to your pension and your future.\n  We need a balance. Walking away from Government, as an evil entity, \nis ignoring the fact that Government, in many instances, is just the \nAmerican family at large. As my wife and I care for our children, we \ncare for others in this country and those who are shortchanged by this \nsystem and who are not protected. Even if it does not affect me \ndirectly and personally, it affects this country, and it affects my \nfuture.\n  So I hope we can find some balance. I hope, when it is all said and \ndone, we do not get so caught up in this alluring notion of the \nownership society that we forget, as we are learning with our military, \nwe have learned in our history, there are times when we need to stand \ntogether as a nation for fairness and for justice. We say here is \nsecurity, opportunity, and making certain people have responsibility in \ntheir actions.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, our time is almost up.\n  I am delighted to have heard the comments of the Senator from \nIllinois. I remember so well when we faced the problem of dealing with \nFederal employees back in the 1980s. We determined that a thrift plan \nwas necessary. We encouraged members of the Federal employee workforce \nto set aside a portion of their income. For every $2 they set aside, \nthe Federal Government agreed to match it with $1.\n  I think this thrift plan has proved to be a decisive factor in \nmaintaining the employment of key employees because it gave them a \nchance to reach out and be part of the general economy, to invest in \nthe issues that were covered by the thrift plan management group. I do \nbelieve it has been a successful venture.\n  I hope the exploration we make of the President's suggestion leads to \na similar type of circumstance, to a similar development of the \nopportunity for everyone covered by Social Security to similarly \nparticipate in funds that are part of the general stock market, part of \nthe general investments of the United States. So many investors now in \nour country participate in that way.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/24/senate-section/article/S116-1", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S116]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

GUTIERREZ TO BE SECRETARY OF COMMERCE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the hour of 3 \no'clock having arrived, the Senate will proceed to executive session \nfor consideration of Executive Calendar No. 1, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Carlos M. Gutierrez, of \nMichigan, to be Secretary of Commerce.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nhours of debate on the nomination, with 1 hour of debate under the \ncontrol of the Senator from Alaska, and 1 hour of debate under the \ncontrol of the Senator from North Dakota.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, it is my intention to make a statement \npresenting the nominee's qualifications and the consideration the \nCommerce Committee gave to this nomination, to be followed by time that \nI will yield to the Senator from Hawaii, Mr. Inouye. I hope that will \nbe acceptable to Senator Dorgan. His time would start following Senator \nInouye's time, who I understand is on the way to the Chamber.\n  This was the first nomination that came before the Commerce Committee \nafter I became chairman. President Bush nominated Mr. Carlos Gutierrez \nto be Secretary of Commerce on November 29, 2004. Mr. Gutierrez is the \nchairman and chief executive officer of the Kellogg Company, a major \nfood products company based in Battle Creek, MI. The incredible story \nof how he got there, rising through the ranks, is a testament to the \nAmerican spirit.\n  Shortly after Fidel Castro assumed power in Cuba during the Communist \nrevolution, Carlos Gutierrez and his\n\n[[Page S117]]\n\nfamily fled their native country. They arrived almost penniless in \nFlorida and, after several years, eventually settled in Mexico City. \nThere at the age of 20, Carlos Gutierrez took a job selling cereal out \nof the back of a van to small grocery stores.\n  With a lot of hard work, 10 years later, he was general manager of \nKellogg's Mexico division. Fifteen years after that, he was running the \nwhole company. It is a great American success story by any measure.\n  Mr. Gutierrez's nomination comes before the Senate at a time of \nsignificant change in the American economy. The shock of September 11, \n2001, a series of corporate scandals, and the spending pressure of the \nwar on terror, including the Iraq conflict, have taken their toll.\n  However, the President's economic stimulus program, centered around \ntax relief, is helping our economy turn the corner. The economy has \ncreated more than 2.4 million new jobs since August of 2003--15 \nstraight months of job gains. The unemployment rate is at 5.4 percent, \ndown from 6.3 percent last June, and is below the average of the 1970s, \n1980s, and 1990s. After-tax income has risen more than 10 percent since \nthe end of 2000, and household wealth is now at an all-time high. Even \nthe stock market has shown strong gains in recent months.\n  Secretaries of Commerce spend much of their time promoting American \nbusiness at home and abroad. If confirmed, Mr. Gutierrez will have an \nimpressive record of growth at his disposal.\n  There is much more to the Department of Commerce than representing \nAmerica's economic interests. Most of the Department's budget is \ndevoted to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. NOAA's \nrole in predicting tsunamis was not well known outside of the Pacific \ncoastal States before last month's devastating tsunami in Asia. The \nadministration recently announced a strong proposal to improve \ndetection and response to tsunami events along the U.S. coast. NOAA \nwill be the lead in this critical endeavor.\n  Mr. Gutierrez has probably already learned more about fisheries than \nhe ever expected. If confirmed, he will learn much more. The recent \nreport of the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy reaffirms the important \nrole that domestic fisheries play in our society. Fisheries create jobs \nin rural communities and provide valuable protein in the world's food \nsupply. The report of that commission highlighted the need to manage \nall fisheries in a sustainable, regional manner. And that is exactly \nwhat has taken place in the State that the occupant of the Chair and I \nhave the honor to represent. Our State, with half the coastline of the \nUnited States, has led in developing new policies to protect and \npreserve the reproductive capability of the fisheries off our shore.\n\n  I commend the President for his Executive order creating a Committee \non Ocean Policy within the White House. Those of us on the Commerce \nCommittee look forward to working with the President and Mr. Gutierrez \nto ensure that our Nation's fisheries are managed sustainably, \nresponsibly, and regionally.\n  On January 5, Senator Inouye and I held a hearing in the Commerce \nCommittee on this nomination. Mr. Gutierrez answered a variety of \nquestions at the hearing and has since responded to many more written \nquestions. The next day, the committee voted unanimously to report this \nnomination to the full Senate. I am here today to recommend the \nSenate's quick confirmation of this nomination.\n  I thank Mr. Gutierrez for his willingness to serve our Nation and the \nDepartment of Commerce, and I join in congratulating the President on \nthis fine nomination.\n  Mr. Gutierrez has my strong support, and I do urge the Senate to vote \nto confirm this nomination as quickly as possible.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 4 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I rise in support of the confirmation of \nMr. Carlos Gutierrez to serve as our Nation's Secretary of Commerce. As \nSecretary of the Department of Commerce, Mr. Gutierrez will take over \nthe helm of a very diverse department, for example, responsible for \ncounting fish as well as people, predicting the weather, developing and \npromoting standards, technology, and promoting fair trade. This is a \nvery difficult and complex appointment, but I believe Mr. Gutierrez's \nimpressive background and experience will serve him well in this \nposition.\n  He was born in Cuba. Mr. Gutierrez left Havana in 1960, shortly after \nFidel Castro took power. Although he has no college degree, through \nhard work and perseverance, he rose from delivering corn flakes to \nsmall stores in Mexico City to the moment when he took over Kellogg's \ncereal and convenience food empire.\n  While at Kellogg, he revitalized the company and put it on a new path \nof success. Mr. Gutierrez will face a variety of demanding challenges \nduring his tenure. But few are greater than addressing the \nadministration's current record on trade. Just this month, our trade \ndeficit hit an astounding and recordbreaking $60.3 billion, and I am \ncertain that all of us will agree that this is entirely unacceptable. I \nwould like to see the new Secretary lead the Department in an \ninnovative and comprehensive effort to reverse the current trend. I can \nassure Mr. Gutierrez that this committee will be a committed partner in \nsuch an effort.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the confirmation of Mr. Carlos \nGutierrez to serve as Secretary of Commerce.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I yield such time to the Senator from \nMontana as he may desire to use.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank the chairman of the Commerce Committee. I rise in \nstrong support of Carlos Gutierrez as the next Secretary of Commerce. I \napplaud the President for this choice for many reasons. Not only is he \na classic American success story, as we have heard from Senators Inouye \nand Stevens, but he is an example for all the opportunities that are \nafforded to Americans.\n  I am especially happy to see the President chose someone from a \nmanufacturing background. He also has a background on the ground, so to \nspeak. It is something to manufacture a product; it is also something \nto sell the product because we live in an economic system where nothing \nhappens until a sale is made. Mr. Gutierrez understands both ends of \nthat equation.\n  For a long time, and since I have been here, this is the first \nSecretary of Commerce who has an agribusiness background. Everything \nthe Kellogg Company does starts in the ground. I am especially happy \nabout that. I would hope we could work together. I have always said \nthere is nothing wrong on the farm except we just don't get as much of \nthe consumer dollar as we used to. We are going to work on that kind of \nsituation.\n  The Commerce Committee oversees some of the most important and \ncontroversial issues that challenge this country and my State of \nMontana. With his commitment--I have yet to meet the man, but we have \nhad an extended telephone call--to work with Congress on these issues, \nhis quick response to the questions I sent to him, and the things he is \ngoing to be doing at Commerce, will put him in a position to assist \nmany sectors of our economy. I would like to take a few moments and \nhighlight some of them and where these issues will be discussed \nprominently in the upcoming session.\n  Let's start with one that affects my State, the timber industry and \nsoftwood lumber. Small mill operators in Montana rely on effective \nenforcement of U.S. trade laws, particularly against unfair trade acts, \nsuch as we have seen coming out of Canada. It is important that the \nCommerce Department ensures full enforcement of the trade laws in the \nsoftwood lumber sector, including selection of accurate subsidy \nmeasurement benchmarks. The 911 implementation was critical \nlegislation. The enhanced 911 bill that\n\n[[Page S118]]\n\npassed the 108th Congress is now law. The law authorizes $1.25 billion \nin grants to build out lifesaving emergency location capabilities \nacross the country. I can remember passing the 911 bill some years ago. \nI said then it is probably the best step that we have taken in public \nsafety in a long time. These grants will be administered by a joint \nprogram office run by the Department of Commerce and the Department of \nTransportation. Basically, what it is, on your cell phone, you dial 911 \nto get emergency. Many years ago, that call did not know where to go. \nIt could have gone anywhere. Today, it goes to the nearest first \nresponder or communications center, no matter where you are in the \ncountry. They can also locate you.\n  ICANN reform. I am concerned about the organization that manages the \nInternet critical domain system. ICANN is falling victim to a little \nbit of a mission creep, turning into a mini-international organization. \nICANN should retain its focus on technical coordination, which makes me \nall the more concerned that the Department of Commerce plans to abandon \nall oversight of ICANN next year. I urge the Secretary to review that \nissue closely and get back to Congress.\n  Our Nation's spectrum policy remains outdated, and I look forward to \nworking with the Secretary in reforming that to keep pace with the \ncommunications revolution. Broadband expensing; the Hollings \nmanufacturing extension partnership program; it is important that these \nprograms move forward, with a good deal of interest coming from his \nDepartment.\n  Again, I want to reiterate my support for Mr. Gutierrez's nomination. \nI look forward to working with him on many of the challenges that my \nState and this country face under a vast umbrella called the Department \nof Commerce. That is what makes our committee probably one of the most \nexciting committees of any that operates in the Senate. I heartily \nsupport his nomination. He should be confirmed.\n  Mr. President, again, I applaud the President for his choice. Mr. \nGutierrez certainly has a classic American success story and can be \nlooked at as an example of how great our country really is and the \nopportunities it presents.\n  I am especially happy to see the President has chosen someone with a \nmanufacturing background. I believe Mr. Gutierrez's tenure at the \nKellogg Company will bring an important insight to the Department in an \narea that certainly needs attention.\n  The Department of Commerce oversees some of the most important and \ncontroversial issues that challenge my State of Montana. I appreciate \nMr. Gutierrez's commitment to working with Congress on these issues, \nand his quick response to my questions following his hearing in the \nSenate Commerce Committee.\n  Mr. Gutierrez will soon be in the position to assist many important \nsectors of our economy. I would like to take a few moments to discuss \nsome of the challenges, priorities and issues faced in my State and \nmany others.\n  As you know, the U.S. timber industry jobs and operations, including \nsmall mill operators in Montana, rely on effective enforcement of U.S. \ntrade laws, particularly against unfair Canadian lumber imports. In \nevaluating the extent of Canadian timber subsidies, for example, it is \nimperative that the Commerce Department ascertain the true market value \nof Canadian timber in comparison to timber pricing data that reflects \nfull value. It is important the Department ensures full enforcement of \nthe trade laws in the softwood lumber sector, including selection of \naccurate subsidy-measurement benchmarks. Mr. Gutierrez has indicated \nhis support of full enforcement of trade laws in the softwood lumber \nsector and I applaud that support.\n  Mr. President, during my time as the Chairman of the Communications \nSubcommittee, I made it a priority to move forward and implement the \ndeployment of universal broadband. Along with my colleague Senator Jay \nRockefeller we have pushed for legislation that would allow for \nbroadband expensing. As you may know, broadband expensing would allow \ncompanies to accelerate depreciation of capital-intensive broadband \nequipment. I am hopeful the Department will provide assistance in \npassing this legislation as part of the President's vast broadband \nvision.\n  I also would urge the Secretary to devote his personal attention to \nan important issue regarding the future of the Internet. I am referring \nto the security of the Domain Name System, which is what ensures that \neach website address in the Internet resolves to a unique website \nreliably and securely. It is vital for the future of e-commerce, and \nthose parts of the economy that increasingly depend on it, that this \nprocess work flawlessly. During the Clinton administration, a private \nnon-profit company known as the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names \nand Numbers, or ICANN, was established to oversee the real technical \nchallenges associated with managing the Domain Name System during a \ntime of explosive growth and political challenges.\n  However, I am concerned, and I know some of my colleagues are as \nwell, that ICANN may fall victim to ``mission creep'' in this case, the \ntendency for it to turn into a mini-international organization, and all \nthe political baggage that comes with that. If so, ICANN's actions \ncould potentially go well beyond the narrow technical mandate that was \nenvisioned for it at its creation. ICANN currently is subject to an \nagreement with the Commerce Department, and I am concerned that not \nenough high-level attention in the Department gets paid to this issue \nespecially since, as I understand it, the Department of Commerce plans \nto abandon any and all oversight role over ICANN some time next year. I \nhope the Secretary will review this issue carefully and with all due \nattention to the national interest and to the interests of Internet \nstakeholders everywhere.\n  The U.S. Government has played a crucial and positive role in the \ncreation of the Internet and in Internet governance, and I do not think \nthat such a decision as this should be taken without thorough review \nand understanding of its implications. I hope that Secretary Gutierrez \nwill take the initiative to understand this vital issue and consult \nwith Congress closely on it in the coming years.\n  Finally, I would like to voice my support for the Hollings \nManufacturing Extension Partnership which is administered at the \nDepartment of Commerce. Montana is a rural State but we have needs and \nopportunities that the Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership has \naddressed. In recent years, I have grown concerned for the programs \nadvancement, but I am hopeful Mr. Gutierrez, with his manufacturing \nbackground, will see the important role the program plays in small \nStates. It is important the Department ensures small manufacturers have \naccess to technical and information resources to allow them to remain \ncompetitive.\n  Again, I would like to reiterate my support of Mr. Gutierrez' \nnomination and I look forward to working with him on many of the \nchallenges my State and the country are faced with under the vast \numbrella of the Department of Commerce.\n  I yield the floor and thank the chairman of the Commerce Committee \nfor giving me this time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we have no further speakers on this side. \nI reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter). The Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, it is my intention to support the \nnomination of Mr. Gutierrez to be the Secretary of Commerce, an \nimportant position in this administration and for our country's \neconomic well-being. However, before I do, I want to call the attention \nof the Senate to some important issues.\n  I come to the floor to speak at some length about a very serious \nproblem: the burgeoning U.S. trade deficit. This is a deficit that \nfundamentally weakens this country, a trade deficit that last month \nalone was $60 billion, a trade deficit that will be something over $600 \nbillion for the year 2004, when we finally get the year-end numbers. \nDespite this growing crisis in international trade, the Congress, the \nPresident, and virtually all of the official Government, seems to be \nwilling to snore through all of this and pretend it does not exist.\n  I think it is fitting that we discuss this at some length at a time \nwhen we are putting a new Commerce Secretary in place.\n\n[[Page S119]]\n\n  Before I do that, let me talk for a moment about Social Security. In \nrecent days there has been a great deal of discussion on that issue. \nThe President indicated that this would be one of the first items we \nwill be confronted with. He proposes to create private accounts in the \nSocial Security system, because he says there is a crisis in Social \nSecurity. Well, there is not a crisis in Social Security. Let me make \nit clear. There is no crisis in Social Security. If we have the same \neconomic growth rates in the next 75 years that we had in the past 75 \nyears, Social Security will be just fine.\n  The only way there is a crisis in Social Security--or you can at \nleast create the impression that there is a crisis--is if you attempt \nto project growth rates that are dramatically lower than that which we \nhave experienced. If you are going to project lower economic growth \nrates--1.8 percent, for example--over the coming years, then you cannot \npredict that somehow investing money in the stock market through \nprivate accounts is going to solve any kind of problem.\n  It is interesting to me that the ethic and value system in America \nhas been that if you are going to provide for your future, you save for \nretirement. The President is suggesting that we should borrow $1 \ntrillion to $3 trillion and dump it in the stock market and hope things \nwill be all right. Even as we do that, the amendment leaked from the \nWhite House says we will cut Social Security benefits by changing the \nadjustment on wages and prices. The construct is this: Claim there is a \ncrisis where there is not, and borrow $1 trillion to $3 trillion and \nput it into the stock market at the same time you cut Social Security \nbenefits.\n  In my judgment, that is a bad policy, one we ought to resist. It is \nimportant for people to understand the Social Security system is not an \ninvestment program; it has never been that. It was created in the 1930s \nand signed into law by Franklin Delano Roosevelt to help the elderly \nescape the plague of a poverty-ridden old age. When he signed that \nbill, 50 percent of America's senior citizens were living in poverty. \nNow it is less than 10 percent. But it is not now and has never been an \ninvestment program. It is a core insurance retirement program. It is \nthe foundation of retirement security. It is always there, not subject \nto risk. It is core retirement insurance. In fact, if you look at your \npaycheck, it says the money that comes out of your paycheck for this \nprogram is FICA. The ``i'' in the FICA is for insurance.\n  The President wants to confuse us by talking about investments. We \nhave a Social Security program that is a core retirement insurance \nprogram. It has worked well for over 70 years. It lifted the hopes and \nlives of so many tens of millions of senior citizens out of poverty.\n\n  We have also, under the rubric of retirement incentives, created \n401(k) programs and IRA programs and pension incentives, all of which \nrepresent investment accounts. I support those. But that is different \nthan the core insurance program called Social Security. In my judgment, \nwe ought to aspire in this Congress to be working toward Social \nSecurity-plus, not Social Security-minus. Those who say the way to \nbuild retirement security is to injure the foundation, or begin to take \naway the foundation that is Social Security insurance, do no favor to \nsenior citizens. The way for us to enhance and embrace and strengthen \nretirement security is to build on the first, second, and third floors, \nnot destroy the foundation.\n  Once again, there is no crisis in Social Security. Let me be the \nfirst to say that we are living longer, healthier lives, and so the \nproblems that might occur 20, 40, 60 years from now in Social Security \nare born of success. We are living longer, healthier lives. And if you \nare a pessimist and believe we will have only 1.8 percent economic \ngrowth rates, which is what the basis is for suggesting there is a huge \nproblem in Social Security--if you are a pessimist, then you can \nsuggest there need to be adjustments in Social Security. But that \ncannot be a pretext for taking apart the Social Security system. That \nis what some wish to do. They never liked it, don't like it now, and \nwant to take it apart. How? They want to create private investment \naccounts inside the Social Security system, which is a big wet kiss to \nWall Street to move money that is borrowed to Wall Street and hope that \nsomehow the social program will be solvent.\n  We have already had substantial experience in the last several years \nwith economic projections by the people telling us this will work. They \ninherited the largest budget surplus in the history of this country and \nwe now have the largest budget deficit in history. They didn't see it \ncoming. They said, by the way, let's count these 10 years of surplus \nbefore they exist and give them back in tax cuts. Some of us said maybe \nwe ought to be more conservative. These surpluses don't yet exist. The \nPresident said never mind, Katy bar the door, give all these moneys \nback even though they have not been realized; give them back in tax \ncuts.\n  The fact is we turned the largest budget surplus into the largest \nbudget deficit in history. The same people who predicted success for \neconomic failure are the people telling us we ought to take apart the \nSocial Security program under the guise of there being a crisis.\n  Let me make one additional point that I think is very important. \nThose who tell us that we will have only 1.8 percent economic growth \nfor the next 75 years, and therefore we have a financing problem with \nSocial Security, also say that private accounts in Social Security \ninvested in the stock market will yield 7 percent. Therefore, it will \nfix the problem. Double-entry bookkeeping doesn't mean you can pretend. \nYou cannot say on the one hand we are going to have slow economic \ngrowth, and therefore a crisis in Social Security, and on the other \nhand, during periods of slow economic growth we will have 7 percent \nannual return on private accounts. It doesn't work that way. Third-\ngrade math will tell you that is fundamentally wrong.\n  My hope is we will have a thoughtful, interesting debate about \nretirement security and about Social Security. I hope at the end of \nthat debate, we will all agree that we should do nothing to undermine \nSocial Security. If we believe that there is nothing more important \nthan our children and taking care of them, and nothing more important \nthan taking care of our parents when they are elderly, we ought to \nprotect the social safety net that promotes those values.\n\n  Social Security has lifted so many in this country out of poverty. It \nhas worked for 70 years and it will work for the next 70 years and well \nbeyond. I for one am not interested in taking apart that which works \nand which makes this a better place to live. After all, those who gave \nus what we now have in this country, who went before us and helped \nbuild this country, built our communities, factories, and our schools, \nand helped increase the standard of living, expanded opportunities for \nour country--those are the people from whom we have inherited this \ngreat life.\n  If we have decided somehow that we don't have the wherewithal to \ncontinue to make this Social Security system work for them, to keep it \na promise they can count on, then there is something wrong with the \nvalue system of this Congress. I don't believe that to be the case. I \nthink at the end of the day we will all agree Social Security is a \nvalue that is important, one we will strengthen and keep.\n  Enhancing retirement security is important as well and, at the end of \nthe day, we ought to have what is called Social Security-plus. We can \ndo Social Security, keep it strong in the long term, and build further \nincentives for IRAs, 401(k)s, and pension programs. That ought to be \nour mission statement.\n  Let me turn back now to the issue of international trade. We have \nbefore us the nominee for the U.S. Department of Commerce. That is one \nof the agencies in our country that deals with trade issues.\n  Mr. Gutierrez, President Bush's selection to head the Department, is \nsomeone whom I will support today. But I don't want this moment to pass \nwithout all of us having to confront something that is very \nuncomfortable for this country, and that is we have a trade policy that \nis weakening America and that is in fact a ``crisis.'' I described \nwhere the crisis doesn't exist, in Social Security; but there is a bona \nfide crisis in international trade.\n  Last month, we heard a report that we had a $60 billion trade \ndeficit--just\n\n[[Page S120]]\n\nlast month alone, $60 billion. We are told that we should expect, when \nall of last year's numbers are in, that our trade deficit will top $600 \nbillion. Add to that the budget deficit of over $400 billion, and we \nhave a combined indebtedness of over $1 trillion in this past year \nalone--$1 trillion. Talk about being irresponsible with our kids' \nfuture. This is it. Yet, do you hear anybody talking about the urgency \nof this? Not a word. Not a whisper. It is like shouting into a strong \nwind to talk about trade.\n  Well, let's talk about some of the issues related to this soaring \ntrade deficit. I am going to go through a series of examples.\n  The January 10 edition of Time Magazine had an interesting article in \nit. It says:\n\n       Chinese pirate companies have long been accused of \n     illegally copying easy stuff like shoe polish and digital \n     movies. Now General Motors says a Chinese firm knocked off an \n     entire vehicle--and Americans could soon start buying its \n     cars.\n\n  So let's talk about that a bit. It is reported that a Chinese firm, \ncalled Chery, has stolen production line blueprints for a GM compact \ncar called the Chevrolet Spark. It is a car that General Motors spent \nhundreds of billions of dollars to develop and the copy car is called \nQQ. It looks like an identical twin to the Spark. The Chinese company \nis now offering it for sale in China for $3,600, a third less than the \nGeneral Motors car.\n  Chery, the automobile company in China, has now announced plans to \nsell five different models, including a sport utility vehicle, in the \nU.S. It teamed up, apparently, with Malcolm Bricklin, who brought the \nSubaru to America in the 1960s. Their plan is to import up to a quarter \nof a million Cherys a year starting in 2007. The Chinese want to send \nus a quarter million Chinese cars in a year.\n  Well, what to make of that? Let me describe a trade agreement that \nour country made with China a while back. We had a bilateral trade \nagreement with China. This is a country that had a large surplus with \nus. Our negotiators negotiated a deal with China. Inexplicably, they \nagreed to this. They negotiated a deal where the Chinese can impose a \n25 percent tariff on any United States cars we ship to China.\n  But on any Chinese cars sent to the United States, we impose only a \n2.5-percent tariff. So our negotiators said to a country with which we \nhave a giant trade deficit: We will agree with you that you can impose \na tariff on bilateral automobile trade that is 10 times higher than \nthat we will agree to impose: 2.5 percent on Chinese cars coming into \nour country, 25 percent on U.S. cars that we try to sell in China.\n  You ask yourself: Who on Earth would have done that? I don't have the \nfoggiest idea. Our trade negotiators did it. They apparently wear blue \nsuits, they have tiny little glasses, they are supposed to think, \nprobably have advanced degrees. And yet they close a door somewhere in \na private room, someplace in secret, and reach a deal that says to the \nChinese: on bilateral automobile trade, you go ahead and impose a \ntariff 10 times the tariff we will impose on automobiles between China \nand the United States.\n  Guess what. We sell very few cars in China. We cannot get them in, \nand the Chinese, having apparently stolen the designs on a new compact \ncar from General Motors, are set to send us a quarter of a million \ncars.\n  Should we perhaps find out who negotiates this sort of incompetence \nso we make sure they never again negotiate on behalf of our country \nbecause this is not some theory?\n  This is about jobs. When you do this, it means you are reducing \nAmerica's job base and enhancing the job base in other countries.\n  On a related note, in a recent year, we saw 690,000 Korean \nautomobiles come to the United States to be sold in the United States. \nGuess how many American cars we sold in Korea? We sold 3,800. So Korea \nsent us 690,000, and we sold them 3,800.\n  There was a time during this period when Korean consumers seemed to \nwant to buy a pickup truck called the Dodge Dakota. Several dozen \norders for Dodge Dakota trucks were coming into Dodge dealers in Korea. \nGuess what. The Korean government decided to announce that the Dodge \nDakota wasn't safe, because it was capable of having a topper installed \nin the back, and that wasn't customary in Korea. So they did a big \nsplashy announcement, and before you knew it, all the orders were \ncancelled. Korean consumers got the message.\n  So in Korea they want to sell their cars in the American marketplace, \nbut they do not want our cars sold in Korea. Will we say to the Koreans \nor the Chinese, for that matter, that either your market is open to our \nproducts, or you are going to have to see your products in Zambia or \nNigeria? I don't think so because our country does not have the nerve, \nstrength, will, or backbone to stand up for America's economic \ninterests, for American workers, American businesses, and American \njobs.\n  I want just one Member of Congress, in the House or Senate, to \njustify this to me--just one. Or to justify the circumstances of mutual \nautomobile trade with China by which we agreed with China that we will \nallow them to impose a tariff that is 10 times ours on bilateral \nautomobile trade. Just one person I would like to stand up and say: \nYes, that makes sense. We know it doesn't make sense. We know it \nundercuts American workers. It moves American jobs overseas, and yet no \none seems to care very much about it.\n  Here is another item in the news. There is a new report that talks \nabout the export of jobs from this country to India. AMR Research \nestimates that the Indian information technology labor force will be \nlarger than 3 million by 2010, and half the workers will be performing \njobs for U.S. companies.\n  Let's talk for a moment about that: these information technology jobs \nthat are being outsourced to India are good jobs. But there are some \nwho think that this outsourcing is a good thing. In fact, the \nPresident's economic report to Congress said that, for example, having \nIndian radiologists reading x rays of U.S. patients would be a good \nthing.\n  What will happen to the 1.5 million Americans who will lose their \njobs in information technology services to the country of India?\n  Well, one thing they will not be doing is producing merchandise for \nexport to India. In 2003, we had a trade deficit with India. That same \nyear the average duty, the average tariff on goods that we were to sell \nto India was 30 percent. According to the U.S. trade ambassador's \noffice, India's economy is one of the most closed in the world and, \nthus, India's tariffs remain among the highest in the world.\n  Now the trade ambassador's office says the Indian economy has the \nmost potential for U.S. exports. I expect that is true, because India \nhas 1 billion people. One out of six consumers on the planet lives in \nIndia. It is the second most populous nation in the world. Yet where \ndoes it list on the U.S. export markets? Second, 5th, 10th, 15th, 20th? \nNo, 24th.\n  In fact, we export nearly twice as much to Peru as we export to \nIndia. And yet we see all of these reports now about American jobs \nbeing sent to India. Apparently, the only thing we can send to India \nare jobs, not goods. India has a 105-percent tariff on cars and \nmotorcycles--in fact, we cannot get motorcycles into India--40 percent \non oranges, over 100 percent on raisins, 30 percent on soybeans, 100 \npercent on durum wheat.\n  You know, you can't have balanced trade these days, even if you want \nit.\n  A family in Illinois this year decided to do something different for \nChristmas. They decided they were going to ban China from under their \nChristmas tree. The mother decided that she was going to buy U.S.-made \nChristmas gifts. Peggy and Dave Smedley were going to buy American for \nChristmas.\n  Of course, that meant no iPods, no digital cameras, no tabletop \nfootball games. And in the end, it was nearly impossible for them to \nfind the Christmas gifts they wanted for their children. They found a \nMonopoly board game that appeared to be made in the U.S. but they \ndiscovered the dice actually came from China. Their son wanted \nAmerican-made boots, and Peggy Smedley looked in 30 stores for boots \nthat were made in America before giving up. The Smedley kids were \nconcerned they might not get any presents at all for Christmas because \nof their mom and dad deciding they wanted to buy American.\n  The 13-year-old Smedley son said he did not know what to expect \nbecause ``I\n\n[[Page S121]]\n\nhave never bought American before,'' which I suppose is an innocent \ncomment from a 13-year-old kid about the world in which we live.\n  Levis used to be all American. They are gone. In fact, I am told that \nthe Levis Company does not make any Levis anymore. The Levis Company \nmakes no Levis. All the Levis are made under contract by contractors.\n  The Christian Science Monitor reported the other day something else \nthat I thought was kind of interesting. One would have thought when \nthey walked around with a pair of cowboy boots that they were walking \nin an all-American pair of shoes, but last month I noticed in the \nChristian Science Monitor even the cowboy boots now sport ``made in \nChina.'' Tony Lamas, top of the line cowboy boots, inside the label it \nmay read ``made in China.'' Thirty-five to 40 percent of these cowboy \nboots have now been outsourced.\n  I have spoken often of Fig Newton cookies. It used to be that Fig \nNewton was the all-American cookie. Well, next time somebody says, let \nus have some Mexican food, just say, give me a Fig Newton, from \nMonterey, Mexico. By the way, Kraft Foods moved the production of Fig \nNewton cookies to Monterey, Mexico. So eat a Fig Newton and you are \neating Mexican food.\n  Fruit of the Loom used to be all-American underwear but not any \nlonger. They are gone. Levis are gone. Huffy Bicycles are gone. Schwinn \nBicycles are gone. Little Red Wagon Radio Flier is gone. They were all \nAmerican, all made by Americans, all represented jobs for American \nfamilies, and they are all gone.\n  Why is all of this happening? Well, what has happened is \nmultinational corporations have discovered there are somewhere around a \nbillion people available on this globe who work for a very small amount \nof money. There is someone in Indonesia today who is making a pair of \nshoes. There is 24 cents direct labor in that pair of shoes that will \nbe sold in Pittsburgh, Fargo, or Los Angeles for $80 a pair, and that \nwoman named Shadisha is going to be paid 24 to 30 cents an hour.\n  There is someone in China today who is making Huffy bicycles. That \nman or woman took the job of someone in Ohio who was making $11 an \nhour, plus benefits. They got fired. They lost their jobs because the \nHuffy bicycles were moved to China and now workers in China are paid 33 \ncents an hour. They work 7 days a week, 12 to 14 hours a day making \nHuffy bicycles.\n\n  The Little Red Wagon Radio Flier Wagon that has been made in American \nfor over a century is gone. It is because corporations have discovered \nthere are a billion people who will work for very little money. In some \ncases, they employ 12-year-olds. They work 12 hours a day. They pay \nthem 12 cents an hour. If my colleagues do not believe it, I can show \nthem.\n  The question is, What does all that mean to our country? What does it \nmean to the world's strongest economy? What does it mean when one \nhollows out the manufacturing base of a country such as the United \nStates? What does it mean when we say to American workers that there is \na new day and a new competition, when we say to the American workers, \nyes, for a century they fought for rights, some lost their lives in the \nstreets of this country fighting for the right to organize; they fought \nfor the right to work in a safe workplace; the American people fought \nfor the right to understand that corporations and factories would not \npump effluents and poisons into the air and water; we fought for child \nlabor laws so 12-year-olds would not be sent down into the mines or \ninto the factories? What does it mean when we are told it is a new day \nand none of those things matter because those who produce can produce \nelsewhere where no restrictions like that apply?\n  A kid can be hired and he can be worked 7 days a week and paid \npennies. And it is said to the American worker, you must compete with \nthat, and if you cannot compete, we are going to outsource, and if you \ndo not like outsourcing, tough luck.\n  I am just wondering how all of this adds up. This country has been a \nwonderful country because going all the way back to when Henry Ford \nmade the Model T he understood that production needs customers. Even as \nhe produced, he was hiring workers and saying: I want to give workers a \ndecent income with which they can purchase that which we are producing. \nHe understood he was employing his own customers.\n  Now we have a different set of circumstances in our country. Now we \nhave products made by child labor, in countries that pollute their \nenvironment, and we are asked to compete with that. After 9/11, when \nthere was a surge of demand for American flags, do you know where they \ncame from? From overseas. The import of American flags jumped to 113 \nmillion American flags in a year. And I bet you that many of those \nflags were made in conditions that would gravely offend the principles \nthat the flag represents.\n  I will put up a chart that shows the growth of the trade deficits \nover recent years, because it describes what this is all about. Year \nafter year, we see these trade deficits growing and growing. It is as \nif it does not matter. Nobody here cares. Nobody here has lost their \njob because of these numbers. There is not one politician in America \nwho has lost their job to outsourcing. There is not one journalist who \nhas lost their job to outsourcing of which I am aware. So it is as if \nit does not exist. It is just the other people who lose their jobs. It \nis people who take a shower after work because they sweat all day at \nwork working long and hard on the factory floor and they are told \nsomehow they cannot make it.\n  I have talked about Huffy bicycles. I received a letter from the \nHuffy folks that they were upset about the fact. They were a little \nhuffy, as the saying would go, about my discussion.\n  In Ohio, workers used to make Huffy bicycles. In fact, Huffy bicycles \nhad a little decal of the American flag.\n  I do not know any of those folks but my guess is that they loved \ntheir jobs. They made a great bicycle. They had 20 percent of the \nbicycle market in America. People could buy them at Sears, Wal-Mart, \nKmart. I am sure that one day when they had to go home and tell their \nspouse, honey, I have lost my job, that it was a painful day. They had \nto tell their spouse and their families: I lost this job not because I \nwas a bad worker--I worked for 20 years for this company; I did a good \njob; I produced a good product--but I lost my job because my company \ndiscovered they could hire somebody for 33 cents an hour to build that \nbicycle.\n  Incidentally, that bicycle took the American flag off the front decal \nand replaced it with a decal of the globe once they moved production to \nChina.\n  What does all of that mean? What does it mean for our country? We are \nrunning giant trade deficits with virtually everyone in the world: \nChina, huge trade deficits. This map shows the world, and it shows in \nred the countries with which we run trade deficits. It is unbelievable. \nHere is the United States. Of course we can't run a deficit with \nourselves. We are running a surplus with Australia down here. We will \nprobably fix that soon, as soon as the new trade agreement with \nAustralia kicks in, because in almost every case, every trade agreement \nwe have done turned out badly for this country because we don't have \nthe backbone to stand up for the interests of our producers.\n\n  Australia, Egypt, Belarus--hey, look, we have a bright spot over here \nin Belarus--these are among the very few countries with whom we have a \ndeficit. With almost the entire world we are running very large trade \ndeficits; virtually the entire world.\n  How long will that last? Mexico is a good example. We had a trade \nsurplus with Mexico--a small one, but a trade surplus. Then we did what \nwas called the North American Free Trade Agreement, and this chart \nshows what happened. Right here is the trade surplus. Then we did a \nNorth American Free Trade Agreement. We had a bunch of these \neconomists, who cannot tell their home address and can't remember their \nphone numbers, give us all kind of highfalutin' predictions about what \nis going to happen. They said this is going to be good for America; the \nonly thing that will come into this country from Mexico with this trade \nagreement is the product of low-skilled, low-wage jobs. Guess what. The \nthree largest imports into America are automobiles, automobile parts, \nand electronics, all the product of high-skilled jobs, exactly the \nopposite of what these so-called economic experts told us.\n  In the meantime, what happened with our trade with Mexico? We have a\n\n[[Page S122]]\n\ngiant trade deficit, serious and growing.\n  Canada is another example. With respect to Canada, which was part of \nNAFTA as well, the trade deficit was a modest trade deficit when we \nstarted. Now it has grown into a very substantial trade deficit.\n  The trade deficit with China is a dramatic trade deficit and it is \ngrowing much worse. I just described part of the problem with China. \nYou can see what is happening here to this country.\n  You can make a case, if you are an economist, that the budget deficit \nis money we owe to ourselves. You can make that case. You can't make \nthat case with the trade deficit. The trade deficit is a deficit we owe \nto others in other parts of the world and will be paid inevitably with \na lower standing of living in this country. It will. You cannot make \nany other case. That is why I come to the floor to say this is very \nserious and very troublesome.\n  I have not mentioned the Japanese. The Japanese are also a good \nexample because every year, for well over a decade, we have had a large \nand abiding trade deficit with Japan. Japan, as you know, has managed \ntrade. The result of managed trade with Japan is that the Japanese \ncontinue to keep certain of our products out, yet they want to ship all \nof their products to the United States.\n  I recall we did a beef agreement with Japan. About 15 years ago this \ncountry did a beef agreement with Japan. At the end of the beef \nagreement you would have thought we won the Olympics. Our trade \nnegotiators were ecstatic, big celebration, jubilation, front page of \nthe Washington Post, good for us. Guess what. Fifteen years after a \nbeef agreement with Japan, a country with which we have a very large \ntrade deficit--we still have a 50-percent tariff on beef going into \nJapan.\n  That would by any definition be a failure, but not with our country, \nbecause we have such low expectations of ourselves and such low \nexpectations of our trade negotiators being willing to stand up for the \neconomic interests of this country.\n  The list is almost endless. Wheat to China. I have spoken at great \nlength about wheat to China, the promises of the Chinese to allow 8.5 \nmillion metric tons of wheat into China and, once again, promises that \nwere not kept.\n\n  The list is virtually endless.\n  We have all these trade negotiators who go out and negotiate \nagreements. As I said, they wear blue suits and small glasses. My \npreference would be to put a uniform on them that says ``USA'' on the \nfront, because I think they forget for whom they work half the time. \nBut nonetheless they negotiate these agreements.\n  Even though in my judgment these agreements have been incompetently \nnegotiated, they are supposed to enforce the agreements. But let me \ntell you what is happening in the Department.\n  We had roughly a $130 billion deficit with China previously. It is \nprobably $160 to $170 billion just in the last year. Yet we have only \n19 people in the Department whose job it is to enforce trade agreements \nwith China.\n  We have a $66 billion trade deficit with Japan. There are only 10 \npeople in the Commerce Department working on opening up trade markets \nin Japan.\n  We have a $13 billion trade deficit with Korea. There are 2\\3/4\\ \npeople--I don't know who the three-quarters of a person is--working to \nopen up the Korean market.\n  Our deficit with the European Union is $77 billion. There are only 15 \npeople working to open up the European markets. It is unbelievable.\n  As I have said, we fought for a century about the basic conditions of \nproduction and the basic rights of workers. We now accept into this \ncountry the products of working people who are told they will be fired \nif they try to start a labor union--just fired.\n  We accept products into this country that are produced by kids. We \nhad a hearing in the Congress some while ago that was heartbreaking. It \ndescribed children who, in a country far away from here, were making \ncarpets and rugs. They were locked in buildings making these carpets \nand rugs. It described the conditions in which the employer took \ngunpowder and put it on the fingertips of these children and lit the \ngunpowder to produce scarring, so these young children, using needles \nto sew these carpets, when they stuck their fingers would not be \ninjured. The scarring would allow these children to be more productive.\n  Is there an admission price to the American marketplace? Have we \ndecided the 1 billion-plus people around the world under virtually any \nconditions of production are acceptable for multinational corporations \nto seek out and to employ to produce products that will be shipped into \nour marketplace? Is that what we want? Do we believe that is in the \nlong-term economic interests of this country? Do we understand that it \nwill injure this country's long-term economy? It will mean that we will \nhollow out not only the manufacturing sector but also the middle class \nin this country, because the jobs they used to expect, the \nmanufacturing jobs that would pay well, with benefits, are not there. \nThey have been outsourced for a quarter an hour or 50 cents an hour.\n  Those who talk about these issues are often called protectionists; \nxenophobic isolationist stooges who just don't get it.\n  The fact is, I am interested in protecting the economic interests of \nthis country. No, I am not interested in protecting Americans from fair \ncompetition. I think competition represents something that is important \nto our producers as well because it makes them better producers. But \nfair competition is critical. I don't believe producers or workers in \nthis country can or should be linked to competition with those in other \nparts of the world who can produce in circumstances where they pollute \nthe air and water, hire children, pay pennies, and work in unsafe \nplants. That is why on trade agreements we have fought on the floor of \nthe Senate to add provisions dealing with environment and labor, and we \nhave been rebuffed at every circumstance and at every turn. We are \nseeing the results of that now--day after day after day.\n  I want to talk just for a moment about something else that Mr. \nGutierrez will inherit at the Commerce Department. I know it is not \nquite the important issue that China, the European Union, Mexico, \nCanada, and Korea are with respect to trade, but I want to talk for a \nmoment about Cuba.\n  Cuba is 90 miles off our shores. It is a Communist country. The fact \nis, we do business with Communist countries. We sell and buy from \nChina, a Communist country. We do the same with Vietnam. We do that \nbecause our country's official policy is engagement through trade and \ntravel. That is the way to move these countries in the right direction. \nWe believe that very strongly. Republicans and Democrats claim that to \nbe the case.\n  It seems to be different, however, with Cuba. Although we do business \nwith Communist China and Communist Vietnam, Cuba seems somehow to be \ndifferent.\n  Then Senator John Ashcroft and I offered an amendment on the floor of \nthe Senate which became law. It became law after 40 years of an embargo \nin which we couldn't sell a thing to Cuba. Senator Ashcroft and I said \nit is immoral to use food and medicine as a weapon; that we ought to be \nable to sell food into the Cuban marketplace. So we got it passed. The \nprovision was that the Cubans had to buy food with cash. But, \nnonetheless, we got it passed.\n  The Cubans have purchased nearly $1 billion worth of agricultural \nproducts from American farmers. But some in this administration have \nnever liked that, and they are doing everything they can to derail and \ntry to stop the sale of agricultural products into Cuba. We have had \nfarm fairs and agricultural fairs in Cuba. The Farm Bureau, the Farmers \nUnion, and American farmers and ranchers have gone to Cuba. Cuba has \nbought nearly $1 billion worth of agricultural products from this \ncountry.\n  Let me tell you what has happened. At an organization called OFAC, \nthe Office of Foreign Assets Control, they have been doing everything \nconceivable to stop people from traveling to Cuba--yes, even to travel \nto sell agricultural products--and to stop the sale of agricultural \nproducts into Cuba.\n  I want to give an example of the absurdity of this. This is a young \nwoman, Joni Scott, who is looking at a Bible. She is a wonderful young \nwoman, a Christian woman, who went to Cuba to\n\n[[Page S123]]\n\ndistribute free Bibles. Guess what happened to this young American \nwoman who went to Cuba to distribute free Bibles? Our Treasury \nDepartment tracked her down and tried to slap her with a $10,000 fine. \nWhat was her transgression? Trying to distribute free Bibles in Cuba.\n  Or, I could show you a picture of Joan Sloat who joined a Canadian \nbicycle tour. What was her transgression? This 76-year-old grandmother \nrode a bicycle for 10 days in Cuba. They wanted to attach her Social \nSecurity through our own Treasury Department. The Office of Foreign \nAssets Control tracked her down and levied a big fine. What they are \ndoing is unbelievable.\n  The Office of Foreign Assets Control in Treasury is supposed to be \ntracking the funding for terrorists. But let me describe the way they \nare using their assets. Twenty-one people down at the Office of Foreign \nAssets Control are tracking American citizens who are suspected of \ntaking a vacation in Cuba. They are under suspicion of taking a \nvacation in Cuba--21 people. They have four people tracking Osama bin \nLaden's financial network. It is unbelievably dumb--the allocation of \nresources in this manner.\n\n  Why do I raise this? Because in the last 2 months or so the \nadministration has decided they want to shut down the agricultural \nsales that do exist and can exist legally by reinterpreting when \npayment must be made and trying to create a circumstance that will wave \noff those who want to sell into Cuba.\n  Mr. Gutierrez and I had a discussion about that when he came to see \nme. He is probably going to have to follow the administration line. It \nis that our farmers ought to be penalized and ought to be prevented \nfrom selling into the Cuban marketplace. The European farmers can sell \nthere. The Canadian farmers can sell there. We have a natural advantage \nto sell into that marketplace because it is closest to us. But this \nadministration wants American farmers and ranchers to pay the cost of \ntheir foreign policy.\n  One day about 2 years ago, as a result of the legislation which I got \npassed, 22 train car loads of dried peas left North Dakota, the first \nshipment in 42 years into the Cuban marketplace. I am proud of that.\n  I think the administration ought to be ashamed at what they are \ndoing. They are saying that trade and travel is the road to \nenlightenment and the road to democratic reform in China and in \nVietnam, but it is not in Cuba.\n  It has nothing to do with common sense. It has to do with politics. \nThe administration knows it, and they are doing everything they can to \nhave American farmers and ranchers--for that matter, people such as \nJoni Scott or Joan Sloat--paying the price of that burden. It makes no \nsense at all.\n  My hope is that as we proceed, some small modicum of commonsense \nmight infiltrate the basic trade policies that are debated both in this \nCongress and also in the administration.\n  It is not the case, for instance, that outsourcing of American jobs \nstrengthens this country. The President's chief economic adviser said \noutsourcing is good. I guess it's good as long as he doesn't lose his \njob. The fact is, neither he nor people like him ever lose their jobs \nin these kinds of constructs. They never lose their jobs.\n  This is about working families, the kind of people who helped build \nthis country of ours, the kind of people who value work. They are the \nones who lose their jobs. They are the victims of unfair trade.\n  My hope is just once--perhaps just once--there would be some kind of \nfire alarm with a $60 billion-a-month trade deficit. But I hear \nnothing. There is this vast silence. I hear nothing about that being a \ncrisis. All we hear is Social Security is in crisis, which, of course, \nis not the case.\n  My hope is that perhaps we can find a way in the coming months, we \ncan wake up to the fact that there is a crisis in trade, and perhaps \nhave the President call an emergency meeting of policymakers and decide \nwhat we do about this. But there is this vast silence about it. Nobody \nwants to talk about it. Again, I suspect it is because nobody here is \nlosing their jobs. But this country will not long remain a world \neconomic power if it doesn't put its fundamentals in order.\n  There is a wonderful book called ``The Lexis and the Olive Tree'' \nwritten by Tom Friedman. In it, he makes the point that just because \nthere is a run on a bank, it is not about whether the bank is solvent \nor has a problem, it is about whether people perceive it to be solvent. \nHe makes the point that market traders always perceive strengths and \nweakness. And when they move against your country and against your \ncurrency, beware.\n  This country cannot long exist with a $1 trillion annual shortfall. \nIn both budget deficits and trade deficits, the fundamentals are out of \nline--completely out of order--and everyone here should know it. Yet we \nare waltzing around here acting as if nothing is happening. That \ndoesn't serve this country's interest. We know better. The American \npeople know better. Our trade policies are in serious trouble and \ndeserve our full attention.\n  On behalf of American workers, on behalf of American businesses, and \non behalf of the future of this great country, we owe it to our kids, \nwe owe it to our future to address this important issue.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I wanted to let my colleagues know \nbriefly of the reasons why I support the nomination of Carlos M. \nGutierrez to be Secretary of Commerce. The Senate will vote on this \nnomination later today. I had the opportunity to sit down and speak \nwith Mr. Gutierrez at length. While he has limited experience with \nmatters handled and regulated by the Commerce Department that are \nimportant to Washington, such as fisheries, aerospace, and \ntelecommunication, I was impressed by his general business acumen and \nmanagement skills. I also found him willing to be personally engaged \nand to engage others on issues outside of his area of expertise. I \nappreciate his willingness to serve, and I look forward to working with \nhim in the future.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I want to share my views on the \nnomination of Carlos Gutierrez to become United States Secretary of \nCommerce.\n  Mr. Gutierrez's rise in the ranks at Kellogg Company--from selling \ncereal out of a truck in Mexico City 30 years ago, to serving as the \ncompany's CEO--is truly a remarkable achievement. Such business \nexpertise will be pivotal for Mr. Gutierrez as Secretary of Commerce. \nIn part, for this reason, I am confident that Mr. Gutierrez is a \nqualified candidate for this office.\n  Nonetheless, I believe that it is important to take note of the \nbreadth of agencies and issues that the Secretary of Commerce oversees.\n  Advancing technology, trade, and business development are just a few \nof the important responsibilities that the Secretary of Commerce must \nassume. Particularly, in my home State of California, the Secretary has \nenormous influence.\n  The Secretary is responsible for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration, NOAA, which is critical to our ability to make use of \noceanic and atmospheric research. For instance, NOAA operates the \nNational Tsunami Mitigation Program, which NOAA created in 1997 and \nmaintains in the Pacific Ocean today.\n  The Secretary of Commerce also oversees the International Trade \nAdministration--ITA. In agriculture, manufacturing and numerous other \nsectors, trade plays a vital role in the daily lives of Californians. \nAccording to the ITA's latest data, 55,421 companies exported goods \nfrom California in 2002. Of these companies, the overwhelming majority \nwere small or mid-sized enterprises with fewer than 500 employees.\n  I believe that strengthening our relationships with trading partners \nis fundamental to the continued growth of California businesses. With \nthe Secretary's leadership, fair and balanced trade policies will help \nCalifornia's markets increase our export capacity even further.\n  I applaud the nominee's openness in his previous statements on the \nneed for reforming specific trade policies that need improving. I hope \nthat Mr. Gutierrez will be a force for leveling the playing field for \ntrade in the future.\n  Although his role representing Kellogg Company was decidedly narrower \nthan that of Commerce Secretary, I expect that Mr. Gutierrez will weigh \nevery position and consequence when considering trade policy. The \npeople of California and the United States depend on it.\n\n[[Page S124]]\n\n  Much of the Commerce Secretary's time must be spent encouraging \nbusiness development. Too many jobs go overseas and I believe that a \nrobust policy to vigorously promote job growth should be a top priority \nfor the Secretary.\n  Since 2001, over 2.7 million manufacturing jobs have been lost. We \nhave also sustained net job losses in the private sector since 2001 and \nhousehold median income continues to lag. We can and must do better.\n  Through agencies like the Economic Development Agency--EDA, the \nCommerce Secretary can be a real catalyst for economic growth. By \nfunding public works projects and innovative enterprises the EDA brings \nopportunity to the communities that need it most.\n  I hope that as Commerce Secretary, Mr. Gutierrez will aggressively \nprotect American jobs and encourage job creation, making full use of \nresources like the EDA.\n  The responsibilities of the Secretary of Commerce are complex and \nfar-reaching, and this will certainly be a challenging position for Mr. \nGutierrez.\n  There is a great deal of work to be done, and I look forward to a \nproductive working relationship with Mr. Gutierrez.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I want to share a few thoughts on \nthe nomination of Carlos Gutierrez to be Secretary of Commerce.\n  The Commerce Department has responsibility for a broad range of \nimportant issues. Managing this diverse portfolio would be difficult in \nthe best of circumstances. But there are a number of special challenges \nthat make the job facing Mr. Gutierrez even tougher.\n  Let me start with trade. A couple of days ago, the Commerce \nDepartment reported that our trade deficit for November exceeded $60 \nbillion. Twelve years ago, our trade deficit for the entire year was \njust $40 billion. Now, it is on track to exceed $600 billion. This \ncourse is unsustainable. If we do not start taking steps now to address \nthis imbalance, we could face a collapse in the value of the dollar \nthat would spark inflation, roil our markets, and dampen our economic \nprospects for years to come.\n  I hope Mr. Gutierrez will take this issue very seriously. We need to \nmake it clear to our trading partners that it is no longer acceptable \nfor them to devalue their currencies to gain a competitive advantage \nover American producers. We need to strictly enforce our laws against \nunfair trade practices. We need to insist that our trading partners \ncomply with the trade agreements they have signed with this country. \nAnd we need to forcefully advocate for global trade rules that will \nunequivocally benefit U.S. businesses, farmers, and workers.\n  I want to touch on one issue in particular. During Mr. Gutierrez's \ntenure as CEO, Kellogg lobbied to increase sugar imports into this \ncountry. Sugar is a vital industry in my part of the country. The sugar \nindustry pumps $2 billion a year into the economy of the Red River \nValley in North Dakota and Minnesota. So it concerns me greatly when \nanyone suggests we should dismantle our successful sugar program to \ntake in more foreign sugar. I had the opportunity to visit with Mr. \nGutierrez a few days ago, and he has assured me he understands that as \nSecretary of Commerce he would be representing all U.S. businesses, \nincluding the U.S. sugar industry, and not just the interests of sugar \nconsuming companies.\n  We also face big challenges on a host of domestic issues within the \njurisdiction of the Commerce Department. For example, over the next 2 \nyears, the Congress will be revisiting the 1996 Telecommunications Act. \nIn the 8 short years since that act was passed, we have had a \nrevolution in communications technology that will require us to rethink \nmany of the rules we adopted then. As we do so, it is critically \nimportant that rural areas not be left behind. I have always been a \nstrong supporter of the Universal Service Fund and the assistance it \nprovides to North Dakota. I remain dedicated to making sure rural areas \nhave access to innovative and affordable telecommunications technology, \nand look forward to working with Mr. Gutierrez on initiatives to close \nthe technological gap between urban and rural areas.\n  Carlos Gutierrez brings an impressive business background to this set \nof challenges. Born in Cuba, raised in Florida, Mr. Gutierrez started \nhis career working for Kellogg in Mexico. From that start, he was \nsteadily promoted until he became chairman and chief executive officer. \nAs CEO, he has been credited with turning Kellogg around. It is my hope \nthat he will have the same success in turning around our trade policy \nand bring the same energy to tackling the domestic challenges under his \npurview.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I heartily support the nomination of Mr. \nGutierrez to be Secretary of Commerce. In nominating Kellogg's CEO \nCarlos Gutierrez to be the next Secretary of Commerce, President Bush \nselected a Michigander who has a wealth of business experience both in \nthe U.S. and abroad which gives him a unique understanding of our \ncountry's role and challenges in the global marketplace. He also has a \nproven track record of wise budget management.\n  Mr. Gutierrez represents the quintessential American dream, \nemigrating to this country with his parents at the age of 7 from Cuba \nand working his way up the ranks of the Kellogg Company, starting with \nselling Kellogg cereal from a van, stocking the shelves of his \ncustomers, to becoming the highly respected President and CEO of a top \nAmerican Fortune 500 Company. His story is as American as Corn Flakes \nand baseball. He is a passionate fan of both.\n  Mr. Gutierrez's home is in Battle Creek, MI, a medium-sized, \nmidwestern city in America's heartland. Mr. Gutierrez has a firm \ngrounding in many of the values and strengths that make this country \ngreat. He also has a firm grasp of some of the challenges facing \nAmerican manufacturers.\n  The U.S. has battled for decades to open foreign markets to U.S. \ngoods. Carlos Gutierrez knows the ropes of those markets and can \nprovide this Nation with that invaluable experience. I have confidence \nthat he will recommend firm action both to pry open foreign markets now \nclosed or partially closed to American goods as well as to reinvigorate \nAmerica's manufacturing base.\n  The leadership that Mr. Gutierrez used to turn around Kellogg's \nfinancial standing is desperately needed in this country, which has \nseen high unemployment, record trade deficits, and an unprecedented \nloss of manufacturing jobs. Mr. Gutierrez will need every bit of his \nexperience to meet the challenges of this new job.\n  We are facing a manufacturing jobs crisis in our country. The U.S. \nlost a record number of manufacturing jobs during President Bush's \nfirst term, 149,000 of which were in Michigan. Michigan's unemployment \nrate stands at 7 percent, the third worst State in the Nation.\n  Unfortunately, this crisis has been worsened by the administration's \nfailure to fund many of the programs that could strengthen the \nmanufacturing sector. The Commerce Department's Manufacturing Extension \nPartnership program, for example, which helps small and medium-sized \nmanufacturing companies remain competitive and has led to $8.7 billion \nin sales and helped create over 100,000 manufacturing jobs in the past \nfour years, faced an 88 percent cut in the President's 2004 fiscal year \nbudget request and a 63 percent cut in the 2005 fiscal year request.\n  The President also proposed eliminating the Commerce Department's \nAdvanced Technology Program, which encourages public-private \ncooperation and focuses on improving the competitiveness of American \ncompanies in the global marketplace. Manufacturing jobs pay high wages, \nprovide health benefits and offer retirement security. We cannot afford \nto lose these good jobs or let them leave our country. I am hopeful \nthat as Secretary of Commerce, Carlos Gutierrez will prove to be a \nstrong advocate for these programs.\n  In addition to rebuilding our base of manufacturing jobs, we need to \ndevise a trade policy that focuses on opening foreign markets rather \nthan employing policies that encourage jobs to move overseas or \ntolerating foreign barriers to our goods and expanding trade deficits.\n  During his time at Kellogg, Mr. Gutierrez managed several of the \ncompany's international divisions, including serving as the general \nmanager of Kellogg of Mexico, the president and CEO of Kellogg Canada, \nInc., and the\n\n[[Page S125]]\n\npresident of Kellogg Asia-Pacific. These experiences provide him with \nthe expertise needed to address our soaring trade deficit and create a \nclimate where U.S. products have the same access to foreign markets as \nwe give in this county to foreign products.\n  The U.S. trade deficit has soared to record levels in the past 4 \nyears. We have a failed trade policy as a nation because we have not \ninsisted that our trading partners grant us true reciprocity and we \nhave not forcefully implemented our trade laws.\n  The U.S. needs to fight much harder to open foreign markets to U.S. \ngoods. In 2003, we had a $124 billion trade deficit with China, and it \nis expected to exceed $150 billion in 2004; we have a large and \npersistent automotive deficit with Japan; and we have tolerated \ncurrency manipulation by several of our trading partners who have \nrigged their currency values, making their exports artificially cheap \nand thus giving their companies a huge trade advantage and devastating \nU.S. workers, farmers and businesses.\n  We can reduce this trade deficit by insisting on a level playing \nfield with our trading partners; by closing tax loopholes that provide \nincentives to businesses to move jobs overseas; and by supporting \nefforts to ensure that China complies with commitments it has made to \nthe World Trade Organization.\n  We also need to adequately fund the Trade Adjustment Assistance \nprogram, which provides relief for small and medium-sized manufacturing \nand agricultural companies that experience loss of jobs and sales \nbecause of foreign imports. These are all areas that would come under \nMr. Gutierrez's jurisdiction as Secretary of Commerce.\n  The nomination of Mr. Gutierrez is part of an overhaul of President \nBush's economic team. I am hopeful that this reorganization also \nrepresents a new direction for the country, and that we are able to \nrebuild our manufacturing sector and reverse our trade deficit. Mr. \nGutierrez's background at Kellogg has given him the experience to take \nthe important steps that are necessary to begin to do that.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased today to express my support \nfor the nomination of Carlos Gutierrez to be the next Secretary of \nCommerce. Mr. Gutierrez's personal history is remarkable. Born in \nHavana, Cuba, Mr. Gutierrez came to the United States at the age of \nsix. He learned to speak English from a hotel bellhop and at the age of \n20, he began working for the Kellogg Company as a truck driver in \nMexico City. A little less than 25 years later, Mr. Gutierrez was in \ncharge of the entire company as the chief executive officer and \nchairman of the board. As CEO, he quickly turned the battered and \ndeclining Kellogg into a strong, stable and increasingly profitable \ncompany.\n  While the next Secretary of Commerce will face serious challenges in \ncoming years from a surging trade deficit to a depleted domestic \nmanufacturing base to a weakened dollar--I am confident that Mr. \nGutierrez is more than capable to do his agency's part in taking on \nthese challenges. I believe that Mr. Gutierrez will bring the same type \nof leadership and determination to the Department of Commerce that he \nhas shown throughout his career in the private sector.\n  I commend the President for making this nomination. Although Mr. \nGutierrez and I may not agree on all economic issues, there is every \nindication that he will serve our country effectively and fairly as the \nSecretary of Commerce. I am proud to support his nomination.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nnomination of Carlos Gutierrez to be Secretary of Commerce. Mr. \nGutierrez has set a great example for all Americans and has proved \nhimself a true leader and visionary in the world of business. It is for \nthis reason I fully support his nomination and I have no doubt he will \nbe a truly superb Secretary of Commerce.\n  Carlos Gutierrez's story is truly inspiring and sets a wonderful \nexample for all Americans. Born in Cuba, Carlos, along with his family \nfled to the United States in 1960 to escape the dictatorship of Fidel \nCastro. Eventually, the Gutierrez family chose to live in Mexico and \nsettled in Mexico City.\n  At the age of 20, Carlos Gutierrez's journey through the world of \nbusiness began when he took a job driving a truck for the Kellogg \ncereal company in Mexico City. Within 10 years, Mr. Gutierrez proved \nhimself an invaluable asset to the company and was promoted to general \nmanager of Kellogg's entire operation in Mexico. Only 15 years later, \nMr. Gutierrez achieved the unthinkable and began running the operations \nfor the entire company. This is truly a prime example of the American \ndream and definitively demonstrates Carlos Gutierrez's considerable \ntalent for business.\n  I am also pleased by this nomination because of the diversity it adds \nto President Bush's Cabinet. This President has demonstrated a \ncommitment to selecting Americans from all walks of life and ethnic \nbackgrounds to serve him, and I believe that the selection of Carlos \nGutierrez is a clear sign of the contributions that Hispanic Americans \nare making to our Nation.\n  I believe as Secretary of Commerce, Carlos Gutierrez will continue to \ndisplay the values and leadership which have been prevalent throughout \nhis career. I have no doubt that as Secretary of Commerce Mr. Gutierrez \nwill be able to meet any challenge facing this country in the future.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for Mr. Carlos \nGutierrez as our new Secretary of Commerce.\n  Considering the global nature of the marketplace, Carlos Gutierrez is \nan outstanding choice for Secretary of Commerce. Without a doubt, Mr. \nGutierrez possesses the necessary skills to assume this important \nposition. His skillful leadership has brought strong growth and success \nto one of the world's most notable companies. Because of his many years \nwith the Kellogg Company, Mr. Gutierrez understands how to create jobs \nand foster greater opportunity for all Americans. I believe that Mr. \nGutierrez will do an excellent job in creating conditions for economic \ngrowth and opportunity by promoting innovation, entrepreneurship, \ncompetitiveness, and stewardship.\n  Consumer demand, rising sales, and increased profits are creating \nconfidence in the growing economy. For example, in my home State, the \nUtah Department of Workforce Services confirms that Utah added 32,200 \nnew jobs in 12 months ending on October 31, 2004, and the Salt Lake \nCity-Ogden metro area topped the list of U.S. cities in the growth rate \nof women-owned businesses. According to the Department of Labor, Utah \nranks third in terms of the largest one-year percentage gains in non-\nfarm employment. And, just recently, Forbes magazine named Headwaters, \nInc., a Utah-based alternative energy technology company, as second of \nthe top 200 best small companies in the United States. These are just a \nfew of many indicators proving that President Bush's policies are \nsucceeding in creating jobs and expanding the economy.\n  I look forward to working with Mr. Gutierrez, as he is undoubtedly \nqualified and prepared to take the helm of the Commerce Department. Of \ncourse, Mr. Gutierrez has many challenges ahead of him, but I am \nconfident that he will serve our country with dedication and \ndistinction.\n  Mr. FRIST. Fortune magazine describes him as possessing ``disarming \ncharisma, steely resolve, and an utter lack of pretension.'' The \nPresident of the United States hails him as a ``great American success \nstory.''\n  It is my pleasure to support the nomination of Carlos Gutierrez, \nchairman and CEO of the Kellogg Company, to become America's next \nSecretary of Commerce.\n  Mr. Gutierrez is a true testament to the American Dream. From humble \nbeginnings as a Cuban refugee, he has become one of the most respected \nand admired businessmen in America.\n  Mr. Gutierrez and his family fled Cuba when he was just 6 years old. \nHis father ran a successful pineapple company in Havana. Then one day, \nthere was a knock at the door. Fidel Castro's regime had named the \nelder Gutierrez an enemy of the state. Mr. Gutierrez's father was \nbriefly imprisoned. The business was confiscated. Mr. Gutierrez recalls \nthat, ``We were on a plane right after that.''\n  The family landed in Miami Beach in 1960. It was there that 6 year \nold Carlos learned English from hotel bellhops.\n  The family eventually settled in Mexico City, and at the age of 20, \nMr.\n\n[[Page S126]]\n\nGutierrez took a job driving a Kellogg van selling frosted flakes to \nsmall grocery stores.\n  Ten years later, he became general manager of Kellogg's Mexico \noperations. Within 3 years, he turned the Mexico plant from the \ncompany's least productive to most productive.\n  After stints in Asia and Canada, Mr. Gutierrez returned to the United \nStates in 1990, and in 1999 became Chairman and CEO of the Kellogg \nCompany.\n  In 5 short years, Mr. Gutierrez has steered the cereal maker into the \nnumber one spot in the U.S. cereal market. Under his leadership Kellogg \nhas become a food industry powerhouse with industry leading sales \ngrowth.\n  Those who have studied his business techniques say that Mr. Gutierrez \nis successful because he is able to focus in on the key issues and \nconvey his vision to everyone--from the assembly line worker to members \nof the board. He believes that every American should have the \nopportunity to succeed.\n  He also believes that America is, and should be, the best place in \nthe world to do business.\n  Former Governor John Engler of Michigan, who has worked with Mr. \nGutierrez, rightly points out that Mr. Gutierrez would be ``the most \ninternational leader that Commerce has ever had.''\n  Mr. Gutierrez says that one of his proudest accomplishments was \nhelping his son and his wife become American citizens. From one \nAmerican citizen to another, I can assure him the pride is mutual.\n  From his remarkable biography, to his meteoric success, Mr. Gutierrez \nis an inspiration to all. He took the American dream and ran with it--\nand, I should note, without ever having finished college.\n  I am confident that his accumulated wisdom, knowledge and skills will \nmake Mr. Gutierrez an effective Commerce Secretary and eloquent \nadvocate of our economic policies and ideals.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the nomination of this extraordinary \nAmerican.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Mr. President, I also rise--in fact, it is the primary \nreason I am here--to recognize and thank a remarkable individual, a \nmember of my team who has served our State of Montana in the Senate for \nmore than 9 years, Zak Andersen.\n  Zak is leaving the post as my chief of staff to go to work for a \ngovernment affairs firm that represents folks in Montana and the \nNorthwest, The Gallatin Group.\n  Zak is a huge fan of that American icon Bruce Springsteen, who once \nsaid: ``The door's open but the ride ain't free.'' The same could be \nsaid of Zak's last 9 years.\n  A graduate of the University of Montana, Zak first started working \nfor me during my 1996 reelection campaign as a door-to-door canvasser. \nAs a sign of things to come, he was quickly bumped up to field \ncoordinator.\n  After the people of Montana, in 1996, decided to return us to \nrepresent them in the Senate, Zak came to work here in my Washington \noffice, where he quickly moved from legislative correspondent, to \nassistant to the chief of staff, to legislative assistant, to \nlegislative director, and finally chief of staff.\n  Zak also played a pivotal role in my 2002 reelection campaign, where \nagain the people of Montana decided to return us, at that time with \nmore than 60 percent of the vote.\n  Zak, of course, is a Montanan. He has an uncanny ability to read, \nfollow, and know Montanans' real values--our hopes, our wishes, our \nfears, and our desires. And he uses that almost constantly to help our \nState.\n\n  Zak worked his way from field staff to chief of staff in 9 years' \ntime. He likes to joke that he ``went from garbage band to broadband'' \nin less than a decade. That he did. In the process, he racked up a list \nof achievements too long to do justice here, but I will name just a \nfew. Recognizing the need for action on improving our State's economic \nwell-being, Zak spearheaded my economic development efforts and helped \nme organize the first ever Montana economic development summit in 2000. \nThat meeting drew more than 1,000 people to Great Falls. That might not \nsound like a lot of folks back here, but in Montana it is. After that, \nhe helped organize two more economic summits, both of which were huge \nsuccesses and helped the people in our State get more good high-paying \njobs.\n  Zak also helped me bring new businesses to Montana, companies like \nNational Electric Warranty. He helped Montana businesses grow and \nexpand, businesses like Zoot Enterprises and Summit Design. He should \nknow that his efforts are not lost on the people who found good-paying \njobs because of his work. Zak led the appropriations efforts in our \noffice, during which time we got important Montana economic development \nprojects funded, projects such as the Mariah II wind tunnel in Butte; \nthe Fort Peck Interpretive Center, MonTec in Missoula and Tech Ranch in \nBozeman.\n\n[[Page S127]]\n\n  Recognizing that methamphetamines have become a scourge in our close-\nknit Montana communities, Zak helped me wage a 2-year campaign--and boy \nit was tough; we worked very hard to get that done--to help me get five \nof our counties with the worst meth problems included in what is called \nthe high density drug trafficking area, otherwise known as HIDTA. That \nis one of our great accomplishments, something of which I am proud, to \nhelp fight the scourge of methamphetamines. That has helped law \nenforcement officials in our State crack down on meth.\n  Zak also helped me work in this Chamber to pass big ticket \nlegislative items such as tax cuts, Medicare improvements, and new \nHealthy Forest legislation. These are just a few of Zak's outright \nachievements. But it is the intangible abilities that I will remember \nmost in Zak. I dare say most in our office will remember those best, \ntoo.\n  In particular is his amazing ability to quickly analyze an issue and \nbreak it down into pros and cons, both from the standpoint of policy \nand of politics. There are a lot of quick minds on Capitol Hill but \nZak, to me, stands out as one of the very best, one of the brightest. \nUndoubtedly, that quickness of mind contributes to his sense of humor: \na bit dark, extremely dry, ever present. Zak's sense of humor is rare. \nIt is remarkable. He has used it to build bridges with the Montana \ndelegation, to keep my office train on the tracks during some of the \nmore bumpy times, and to mentor younger staffers as they learn the ways \nof working in this remarkable place.\n  We will also remember him for his elaborate practical jokes that \noften involve the whole office. But beyond that, we will remember Zak \nfor his uncanny ability to get things done and his relentless \ncommitment to Montana. His no-nonsense style, his can-do attitude \nhelped me and others accomplish great things for our State and most \nespecially for our people.\n  A humble guy from Helena, Zak embodies Montana--a very bright, \ntalented, committed guy, hard working, genuine, and astute, and ever \nmindful of the fact that he is very lucky to be from and advocate for \nthe greatest State in the Union. He is extremely loyal.\n\n  Zak loves his microbrews, Mr. Bruce Springsteen, a gin-clear trout \nstream, the Oakland Raiders, record stores, and University of Montana \nfootball. Most of all, he loves his native State of Montana.\n  Fittingly, one of his favorite authors is Cormac McCarthy. Many of \nthe McCarthy books are about the American West and therefore not for \nthe faint of heart. But they are also very real, sparsely punctuated, \nlight on frills, heavy on matters of depth and critical thought--in \nother words, a lot like Zak.\n  As the pages of his life open to endless opportunity, we will all \nremember Zak: His remarkable abilities, his devotion to the State he \nloves; and his commitment to excellence in all that he does.\n  We will miss you, Zak. We will miss you in our office, but we are \ngoing to find you very quickly. You are still part of our team. And I \nthank you, Zak, so very much. Montana thanks you and a grateful nation \nthanks you for your service.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn).

Mr. President, today Senate Democrats introduced 10 \nbills that illustrate the priorities and values we intend to fight for \nin the coming months to meet our commitments to the American people. It \nis an agenda for a future of security, opportunity, and responsibility. \nThe contrast with the Bush administration and the Republican leadership \nin Congress could not be greater. They say they are for ownership, but \ntheir vision means an America divided. In a society based on ownership, \nwe are divided by winners and losers, rich and poor, a shrinking middle \nclass, owners and those who cannot afford to own.\n  Republicans see the forces of globalization as a chance for greater \nprofits at the expense of job and wage security for American families. \nDemocrats are for opportunity for all. Our vision is for an America \nunited to provide opportunity for all Americans and to fulfill the \nAmerican dream.\n  We embrace the challenges of globalization not by lowering our wages \nbut raising our skills to equip every American to compete for good jobs \nin the local economy.\n  I will mention three areas in which Democrats have introduced bills \ntoday that reflect our values and priorities. First, health care. It is \nan honor to join our Democratic leader and so many of our colleagues in \nintroducing the Affordable Health Care Act in meeting our \nresponsibility to the Medicare Beneficiaries Act. This Affordable \nHealth Care Act states our strong commitment as Democrats to end the \ncrisis in health care that affects every family. It is a downpayment on \nour commitment to quality, affordable health care for every American \nand we will not rest until that goal is achieved.\n  The worsening crisis in health care is caused by skyrocketing costs, \ndeclining insurance coverage, and less security for every family. \nBusinesses, especially small businesses, find it increasingly difficult \nto provide decent coverage for their employees. Rising health care \ncosts threaten the competitiveness of all American businesses. Even \npeople who have health insurance today cannot count on it being there \nfor them tomorrow. No American family is more than one pink slip or one \nemployer decision away from being uninsured.\n  In the face of this massive crisis in health care, the administration \nand Congress have been missing in action for too long. The legislation \nwe are offering today will not solve all of these problems, but it is a \ngood start and we are committed to finishing the job. It will guarantee \ncoverage for every child. It will lower prescription drug costs by \nallowing importation of safe drugs from abroad. It will improve the \nquality of health systems while reducing costs at the same time by \nadopting a modern information technology in health care.\n  Affordable health care is a high priority for every family and it \nshould be an equally high priority for this Congress. We face a crisis \nand it is time to act. Senate Democrats are committed to guaranteeing \nthe basic right to health care for all Americans and when we say \n``all,'' we mean all.\n  The legislation we are introducing today cuts the special interest \ndeals out of the Medicare Program, addresses the troubling gaps in the \nMedicare drug benefit. Medicare is a solid commitment to our senior \ncitizens, not a piggy bank for special interests, and it is time to \nfulfill that commitment.\n\n  Second is education. Our Nation's future depends on ensuring equal \neducational opportunities for all children. We must keep the promise to \nleave no child behind. For Democrats, this is not just a slogan. For \nus, it is a moral commitment. This year alone, the Bush administration \nunderfunded No Child Left Behind by $9.8 billion, leaving 4 million \nchildren behind. In contrast, we propose fully funding No Child Left \nBehind and also keeping our promises to disabled children by fully \nfunding the Individuals With Disability Education Act.\n  We also recognize that what we do for children's early education and \ndevelopment does more to ensure their success later in school and later \nin life\n\n[[Page S128]]\n\nthan any other investment. Democrats are committed to making this \ninvestment by expanding Head Start, early Head Start, and childcare \nfunding. At the same time, we propose improving the quality of these \nprograms by requiring improved standards for teachers and seeing that \nthey are supported, trained, and adequately compensated to do the job.\n  We also must do more to ensure that America is globally competitive \nby raising our skills. To be globally competitive, we must also inspire \na renaissance in math and science education in America so that all \nAmericans are prepared for the jobs of tomorrow. Today, Democrats are \ntaking an essential first step in winning the global and math/science \narms race by making college tuition free for any young person willing \nto work as a math, science, or special education teacher. We must make \nthe United States first in the world rather than 29th in math and \nscience.\n  Finally, when it comes to jobs, the Fair Wage, Competition and \nInvestment Act will help restore the faith of Americans that if they \nwork hard and play by the rules they can live the American dream.\n  The bill raises the minimum wage to $7.25 an hour to improve the \nquality of life for 7.5 million workers. Despite Democratic efforts to \nraise it, the minimum wage has been stuck at $5.15 an hour for 7 long \nyears.\n  And the bill will restore overtime protections for the more than 6 \nmillion Americans denied overtime pay and the guarantee of the 40-hour \nworkweek by the Republican overtime rule. It will also expand overtime \nprotections to cover additional workers.\n  The Democratic bill eliminates tax breaks for companies that ship \ngood American jobs overseas. It requires companies that send jobs to \nother countries to provide advance warning to workers and communities.\n  The bill makes significant investments in American roads and \nwaterways, broadband technology, and research and development to \nincrease our competitiveness, improve the quality of our lives, and \ncreate new jobs to help make up for those lost under Republican \nleadership.\n  These are the kinds of initiatives that Democrats will fight for this \nyear--initiatives that will expand opportunity, provide a secure future \nfor our families, and improve the quality of life for all Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/24/senate-section/article/S128-1", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S128-S129]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THE PRESIDENT'S NOMINEES\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, Jay Bybee, William Haynes, Condoleezza \nRice, Alberto R. Gonzales--these four persons have three things in \ncommon. They were all high officials in President Bush's first \nadministration. They were all key participants in the shameful decision \nby the administration to authorize the torture of detainees at \nGuantanamo and in Iraq and they have all been nominated by President \nBush for higher office.\n  Jay Bybee, head of the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, \nwas nominated for a lifetime appellate court judgeship in the spring of \n2002, before he wrote the now notorious legal memorandum redefining \ntorture so narrowly that virtually the only victims who could complain \nwould be dead victims. Mr. Bybee even went so far as to state that the \nPresident could simply decree that any action taken as the Commander in \nChief was immune from challenge. Most people who later read that memo \nimmediately rejected its conclusions. But not the White House.\n  Instead, when the Bybee nomination was not acted on by the Senate in \nthe 107th Congress, President Bush renominated him for the same \njudgeship in the 108th Congress. Although we asked for Bybee's OLC \nwritings we received nothing, thus the Senate knew nothing about the \nBybee memorandum on torture, and his nomination was confirmed.\n  William Haynes was, and still is, General Counsel to the Secretary of \nDefense. As such, he had a personal role in deciding how far Defense \nOfficials could go in interrogating detainees. But he had a problem. \nHigh-level military officers and top State Department lawyers were \nexperienced in these issues and the treaties that governed them, and \nthey were adamantly opposed to the extreme change in policy that he and \nthe Secretary and the White House were seeking.\n  So he formed a ``working group'' of lawyers that excluded these \ndissenters. That working group's report adopted verbatim some of the \nmost outrageous parts of the Bybee memorandum. In one memo, for \nexample, Mr. Haynes told Secretary Rumsfeld that waterboarding, forced \nnudity, the use of dogs to create stress, threats to kill the \ndetainee's family, and other extreme tactics not only do not violate \nthe Uniform Code of Military Justice, but are ``humane.''\n  After he did that, the White House also nominated him to a lifetime \njudgeship on a Federal court of appeals. Fortunately, by the time the \nJudiciary Committee was ready to vote on his nomination in late 2003, \nwe had become aware of some of his other controversial legal views, and \nthe Senate did not confirm him. President Bush has chosen to renominate \nhim, however, so the Senate will have another chance to review his role \nin support of torture.\n  Condoleezza Rice has been nominated to be Secretary of State, and we \nwill consider her nomination later this week. As national security \nadviser she was clearly involved in the prisoner abuse issues, but \nbecause of the nature of her position, we know less about her role. Two \nof the members of the Foreign Relations Committee have voted against \nher nomination, and we will hear their full report in the coming \ndebate.\n  White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales, as the President's chief in-\nhouse lawyer, was at the heart of the debate, inside the \nadministration, on prisoner detention and interrogation. Although he \nsays he can't remember it very well, he apparently was the person the \nCIA contacted when they wanted to use extreme interrogation methods on \nthose whom our troops and intelligence agents detained in Afghanistan \nand Iraq and elsewhere. He was the one who went to Mr. Bybee at the \nDepartment of Justice to obtain the notorious Bybee memorandum \njustifying the use of torture. He keeps saying he doesn't recall, but \nhis office obviously helped Mr. Bybee develop the memorandum.\n  When Mr. Gonzales received the memorandum, he disseminated it far and \nwide in the military and elsewhere, although he can't remember how. For \nalmost 2 years, Mr. Gonzales allowed this policy guideline to stand \nthroughout the Government as the administration's formal policy on \nprisoner abuse. For almost 2 years it remained in effect, producing a \nsystem of detention and interrogation that the International Committee \nof the Red Cross, the FBI, the Defense Intelligence Agency itself found \nabhorrent to the rule of law. When the Bybee memorandum finally became \npublic last summer, Mr. Gonzales attempted to distance himself and the \nPresident from it, but he didn't quite withdraw it.\n  Suddenly last month, the night before New Year's Eve, so late that \nmost newspapers could not get the story in the next day's paper, Mr. \nGonzales and his Justice Department and White House colleagues decided \nthat the memo was so clearly erroneous and its standards so extreme, \nthat it should be withdrawn altogether and replaced by a gentler \nversion.\n  Members of the Senate have asked repeatedly for the relevant \ndocuments on all this. But we have not received a single one of the \ndocuments we need.\n  Four Senate committees have now considered some part of this issue. \nThe Foreign Relations Committee had a brief opportunity to question Ms. \nRice last week, but apparently not enough information on her \ninvolvement was available to assess her responsibility. The \nIntelligence Committee is still waiting to hear from the CIA on its \nrole in the prisoner abuses, but as far as I know nothing has been \nforthcoming. Despite the initiatives and hard work of the chairman, the \nranking member and many other members of the Armed Services Committee, \nSecretary Rumsfeld and his deputies have managed to stonewall and slow-\nwalk us right through the election, and have used a series of separate \ninvestigations to propagate the original message that it was just a few \nbad apples on the night shift who committed the abuses.\n  We now are told that there was confusion and lack of clarity in the \nrules on interrogation without any indication of who was ultimately \nresponsible, and without any accountability by those we know were \ninvolved, such as Mr. Haynes and Mr. Gonzales.\n\n[[Page S129]]\n\n  That leaves the Judiciary Committee, which is now considering Mr. \nGonzales's nomination to be Attorney General. What standard should we \napply to him? We know that rejection of a cabinet nominee is rare. In \nall of U.S. history, although hundreds of nominees have been stopped in \ncommittee or withdrawn by the President, only 9 of over 700 cabinet \nnominees have actually been rejected by the Senate. Two of them have \nbeen nominees for Attorney General. President Calvin Coolidge's nominee \nfor Attorney General was rejected not once but twice and both times by \na Senate of his own party.\n  Mr. Gonzales's case is a rare case in which a nominee may have been \ndirectly responsible for policies and resulting practices that have \nbeen counter-productive, contrary to international standards and \npractices, harmful to our troops' safety, legally erroneous, and \nplainly inconsistent with the rule of law and the basic values which \nthis administration prides itself on defending.\n  President Bush's Inaugural Address resounded with those values last \nweek. ``From the day of our Founding,'' he said:\n\n     we have proclaimed that every man and woman on this earth has \n     rights, and dignity, and matchless value, because they bear \n     the image of the Maker of Heaven and earth.\n\n  The choice before every ruler and every nation, he said, is:\n\n     the moral choice between oppression, which is always wrong, \n     and freedom which is eternally right.\n       America's belief in human dignity will guide our policies,\n\n  he said.\n\n       Americans move forward in every generation by reaffirming \n     all that is good and true that came before--ideals of justice \n     and conduct that are the same yesterday, today, and forever.\n\n  Those are lofty values, and all of us agree with them wholeheartedly. \nBut they were abandoned by the White House in its decision on the use \nof torture, and our credibility in the world as a leader on human \nrights and respect for the rule of law has been severely wounded. The \ncruelest dictators can now cite America's actions in their own defense.\n  How can we be true to our own oath to defend the Constitution, if we \nconfirm as the highest legal officer in the land a person who may well \nhave encouraged our basic values to be so grossly violated?\n  So far, Mr. Gonzales has not been responsive to our questions in the \nJudiciary Committee about his role. He still has time to clear the air, \nand I urge him to do so.\n  The position of Attorney General and the issues involved in this \nnomination go to the heart of our Nation's commitment to the rule of \nlaw. A nominee whose record raises serious doubts about his own \ncommitment to the basic principle should not be confirmed as Attorney \nGeneral of the United States.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/24/senate-section/article/S129-1", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S129-S130]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I didn't intend to speak this afternoon, \nbut after listening to the comments of the Senator from Massachusetts \nregarding four individuals, three of whose nominations are pending \nbefore this body, I believe a brief statement and indeed a brief \ncorrection of the Record are necessary.\n  I am well aware that in politics a charge unanswered is often a \ncharge believed. Indeed, I think the practice is not too rare that some \nbelieve if you make the same erroneous charge over and over and over \nand over again despite the facts that eventually your opponent will \ntire and fail to correct the Record. I don't want to be guilty of that \nbecause I believe not only do the American people need to know the \ntruth and not be misled, the nominees whose integrity has been impugned \nduring this all too painful and sometimes even cruel process deserve \nbetter.\n  Obviously, the Senate in providing its advice and consent on the \nPresident's nominations should ask hard questions, and we should press \nfor answers to those questions. But there does come a point where the \nprocess no longer becomes one that can be described as a search for the \ntruth but, rather, becomes akin to harassment, and, unfortunately, I \nthink that line has been approached.\n  Let me explain what I am talking about. The Senator from \nMassachusetts talked specifically about four individuals--Mr. Bybee, \nwho is now a circuit court judge; Mr. Haynes, who is the general \ncounsel for the Department of Defense; Condoleezza Rice who, as the \nChair knows, we all know, has been nominated by the President to be \nSecretary of State, and whose confirmation we will debate tomorrow, \nand, finally, the name of Alberto Gonzales, currently White House \ncounsel, having been nominated to serve as Attorney General. Those are \nthe four individuals who are the object of his comments.\n  I want to be fair to the Senator from Massachusetts. Sometimes when I \nwas listening to him I thought my hearing was betraying me. I was not \nquite sure what I heard was, in fact, what he was saying because it was \nso far from what I believe the facts to be. I believe, and the Record \nwill correct me if I am wrong, he used words tantamount to authorize \nthe use of torture. He did, and I wrote this down, speak of a ``formal \npolicy of prisoner abuse''--of course, all of which pertains to the \nallegations, indeed, the proof in some circumstances, of prisoner abuse \nat places like Abu Ghraib.\n  To conflate the acts of a few criminals with the acts of \ndistinguished public servants who have disavowed any policy, any \napproval, of abuse or the use of torture as a policy of this \nGovernment, to conflate and somehow confuse and gloss over them and to \nsuggest that indeed these individuals did somehow by their acts or \ninactions authorize the use of torture or condone, encourage, or create \na perception that torture was okay, is just false. It is a story, but \nit is a false story. The American people should not be confused because \nthe facts clearly point to the contrary.\n  We do know that the Department of Defense, pursuant to the \ninvestigation called for by Secretary Rumsfeld, has conducted eight \ninvestigations, three of which have not yet concluded, of the Abu \nGhraib prison scandal. So far, the conclusion has been, as well as that \nof the independent investigations like that of former Defense Secretary \nSchlesinger, that the acts at Abu Ghraib are the acts of a criminal few \non the night shift, not a matter of public policy of this Government or \nof the Department of Defense or any branch or agency of the Government.\n  Indeed, recently we saw the American system of justice mete out that \njustice in convicting one soldier, Graner, of abusing prisoners at Abu \nGhraib and meting out a 10-year prison sentence in that connection.\n  It is not true, and the American people should not be misled or \nperhaps be given information that has no justification in the Record. \nIt is unproven, these allegations. They are unjustified. Frankly, I \ndon't believe it does this body honor to propagate these false \nallegations.\n  Everyone has a right to their opinion. I know some of the speakers \nwho are so concerned from time to time about what happened at Abu \nGhraib, as we all are, disapprove of this Nation's policy in the first \nplace in going to war in Iraq and removing Saddam Hussein. Somehow, and \nthis is unthinkable to me, they actually think that the world would be \na better place with Saddam still in power. I disagree. Not only is the \nworld a better place with Saddam in a prison cell awaiting trial, but \nthe American people are safer and the people of Iraq now have the hope \nof a free, fair election in the next week or so leading, we all hope, \nto a free and democratic Iraq.\n\n  While everyone has a right to their opinion, no one has a right to \ndistort the facts. Unfortunately, when it comes to the involvement of \nthese four individuals--Mr. Bybee, now Judge Bybee, confirmed by this \nSenate not too long ago by a vote of nearly 80 Senators; Mr. Haynes, \nwho is the general counsel for the Department of Defense; and as I \nmentioned, Condoleezza Rice\n\n[[Page S130]]\n\nand Alberto Gonzales--the allegation that somehow they have been \ninvolved in a Government policy of condoning torture or authorizing \nprisoner abuse is just false. It is important to stand up and say so.\n  Our disagreements about policy, indeed, the foreign policy of this \nGovernment, whether it be authorizing the use of force or whatever the \nissue may be, cannot be used as an excuse to make such scurrilous \nallegations against public servants who I believe are trying to do \ntheir best. If, in fact, somehow this administration and these \nindividuals who are engaged in important public policy decisions did \nnot care one whit about what the law is, what the definition of torture \nis, and how we can avoid somehow engaging in this sort of illegal and \nheinous act against any human being, why would they research the law? \nWhy would they write lengthy legal memoranda? Why would they have \ndebates among themselves about what the law is and what Congress \nproscribed--indeed, what our international treaty obligations proscribe \nin this area. They would not. You would not be so scrupulous and so \ncareful about what the law provides if you did not care about following \nthe law. That has been what these individuals and this administration \nand this Government have tried to do under very difficult \ncircumstances.\n  In conclusion, I hope our disagreements about some aspects of our \nNation's foreign policy, our policy in Iraq, should not be license to \ndistort the facts and impugn the character of these nominees. Three are \nnominees, one already has been confirmed. We know Mr. Haynes has been \nrenominated by the President to serve as a circuit judge. We know \nCondoleezza Rice's nomination to be Secretary of State will be debated \ntomorrow in the Senate.\n  Finally, I expect on Wednesday Judge Alberto Gonzales will be voted \nout of the Judiciary Committee and that nomination will soon come to \nthe Senate.\n  It appears the opponents of this administration and its policies will \npass no opportunity to continue to repeat false charges which cannot be \nborne out by the facts and which I think need to be corrected.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to speak to the American people \nabout the values and priorities of the Senate Democratic caucus. Today \nSenate Democrats introduced 10 ambitious leadership bills that will \nmake our country more secure, expand opportunity for all, and honor our \nresponsibility to future and past generations.\n  The Democratic agenda stands in stark contrast to the priorities \nadvanced by Republicans. Democrats understand that putting America's \nsecurity first means providing troops and their families with the \nresources they have told us they need to protect our freedom. Where \nRepublican mismanagement has put our country's security at risk, \nDemocrats will stand with our troops and step up efforts against \nterrorists by targeting and shutting down the institutions that create \nthem. Where Republicans have stood with big corporations and put the \nneeds of the special interests ahead of the American people, Democrats \nwill work to expand opportunity for families by bringing down health \ncare costs, strengthening education, and creating good-paying jobs.\n  Democrats will promote fiscal responsibility in Washington with a \nreturn to commonsense budgeting. But our most urgent priority is to \nprotect our Nation's security. That is why we will stand up for our \ntroops. We believe that putting America's security first means standing \nup for our troops and their families. We will work to increase our \nmilitary end strength by up to 40,000 by 2007, and we will create a \nGuard and Reserve bill of rights to protect and promote the interests \nof our dedicated citizen soldiers. That includes making sure our troops \nhave the body armor and equipment they need and that their families \nreceive health care and their pay on time while their loved ones are \nserving abroad. This bill would increase survivor benefits from $12,000 \nto $100,000 for their families, if, God forbid, a loved one loses his \nor her life while serving our country.\n  We will also target the terrorists more effectively. We will keep \nAmerica secure by stepping up the fight against the radical terrorists. \nWe will work to increase our special operations forces by 2,000 to \nattack the terrorists where they are and to protect our freedoms here \nat home.\n  Democrats are also united to ensure that the world's most dangerous \nweapons stay out of the hands of terrorists. We will expand the pace \nand scope of programs to eliminate and safeguard nuclear materials, \nenhance efforts to keep these and other deadly materials out of the \nhands of terrorists, and assist State and local governments in \nequipping and training those responsible for dealing with the effects \nof terrorist attacks involving weapons of mass destruction.\n  When our veterans come home, we will not abandon them. We will keep \nour promise to them. We now have a new generation of veterans returning \nfrom Iraq and Afghanistan. We will ensure that all veterans get the \nhealth care they deserve. We will make sure that no veteran is forced \nto choose between a retirement and a disability check.\n  We will also make the same commitment to the soldiers of today that \nwas made to past veterans with a 21st century GI bill. We understand \nthat one of the most effective ways to increase opportunities for our \nfamilies is a high quality, good-paying job. The promise of America is \nthat if you work hard and play by the rules, you should have a real \nopportunity to provide for yourself and your family. For too many \nAmericans, this promise is out of reach today. We must ensure that it \nis within their grasp.\n  We must expand economic opportunity for all Americans by protecting \nAmerican workers and ensuring that we are creating good jobs for today \nand for the future. Our plan creates new jobs with an expansion of \ninfrastructure programs, encourages innovation, and ensures fair wages. \nIt also eliminates tax incentives for companies that move jobs \noverseas. It ensures that we enforce our trade policies.\n  The Stabenow-Corzine bill ensures fair wages for our American \nworkers. It restores overtime wages to 6 million workers and increases \nthe Federal minimum wage over the next 2 years so that we can ensure a \nlivable wage for every American worker. These are the people who serve \nour food and stock the shelves of our local grocery stores, care for \nour children and our elderly parents, and it is incredibly important \nthat we honor, respect, and support them and the dignity of work.\n\n  It also provides relief to multi-employer pension plans to make them \nmore solvent. These plans are used predominantly by small businesses to \nprovide pension benefits to an estimated 9.7 million American workers. \nThe Stabenow-Corzine bill creates good jobs for today and new jobs for \nthe future, with an expansion of infrastructure programs and the \nencouragement of innovation.\n  Across America, thousands of infrastructure projects, from our \nsmallest rural communities, to our biggest cities, await the Capitol to \nmove forward. Making these investments in our roads, bridges, and \nbuses, will enable our quality of life to improve and protect public \nhealth and safety. These investments will also create a huge boost to\n\n[[Page S131]]\n\nour economy. For each $1 billion in investment, we create 47,000 good-\npaying American jobs.\n  We also need to make investments in technology. Too many communities, \nmostly in rural and economically disadvantaged areas, lack access to \nbroadband Internet service. More and more, Internet access is a \ncritical part of our economy and our schools. This bill expands \nbroadband access to those underserved areas by allowing broadband \nservice providers to immediately deduct one-half of the cost of their \ninvestment in equipment to provide broadband access to rural and \nunderserved areas. This is not just the right thing to do, it is the \nsmart thing to do. We are a nation of innovators, of ideas. The key to \nour economic strength is our leadership in science and technology.\n  The U.S. is losing ground today to our foreign competitors. Research \nand development helps create higher quality jobs, better and safer \nproducts and higher productivity among American businesses.\n  It makes permanent a tax credit for entities that increase their \nresearch activities, which is so critical; and it makes credit \navailable for collaborative partnerships, for research done by a group \nof businesses or other entities. We also want to ensure that we \ncontinue to lead and educate future leaders in science and technology.\n  Our bill also supports increases in federally funded research at the \nNational Science Foundation, the Office of Science at the Department of \nEnergy, the National Institutes of Health, and the National Institute \nof Science and Technology, as well as investments in math and science \nand technology programs at our secondary education institutions.\n  The Stabenow-Corzine bill eliminates tax incentives for companies \nthat move jobs overseas--a critically important feature today for \nworkers in every State, and I would certainly say in my State of \nMichigan, where we make things. We make things and grow things and do \nit well, and we don't want to see incentives in our Tax Code for \ncompanies to move jobs overseas.\n  We must eliminate tax incentives that actually give companies a tax \nincentive to move production facilities and jobs overseas. It doesn't \nmake sense to reward a company for moving jobs overseas and, in effect, \nfor pushing the promise of America farther away, farther out of reach.\n  Let me give you an example. In Greenville, MI--I have spoken about \nGreenville many times on the floor--is Electrolux. In Greenville, MI, \nthey had three different shifts going and added over $100 million in \nnew investments in equipment at the Greenville Electrolux plant. They \nare efficient, effective, and they are doing the job. They are selling \nrefrigerators. Electrolux decided they could make a bigger profit if \nthey moved the plant to Mexico and paid $1.57 an hour and no health \nbenefits. We are losing 2,700 jobs as a result of that and we, \nunfortunately, have incentives in the law today that encourage that to \nhappen. That is wrong.\n\n  We need to tackle the issues of health care, and we are doing that in \nour legislation, with a lower cost for prescription drugs and a lower \ncost of health care for our businesses. Ultimately, we cannot compete \nand have a middle class in this country if we are telling everyone they \nneed to work for $1.57 an hour in order to have a job and we will \ncreate incentives for their businesses to move to another country. Our \nbill would require companies to immediately pay tax on the profits they \nearn abroad for products that are imported back to the United States. \nWe think that is fair.\n  The Stabenow-Corzine bill ensures that America has a trade policy \nthat addresses our now record trade deficit by enforcing our trade \nagreements, maintaining a level playing field, and helping workers who \nhave lost their jobs due to unfair labor practices of other nations. We \nare determined to pursue a trade policy that protects American workers \nand addresses our record trade deficit.\n  This bill requires the administration to identify the most important \nexport markets that remain closed to U.S. products and provides the \ntools needed to open them. As I have said so many times, if we create a \nlevel playing field--all we ask for are the same rules. If we have the \nsame rules for our businesses and our workers that we see in other \ncountries, we will compete and we will win. But it is our job to make \nsure that happens. That is why this legislation also creates the office \nof chief enforcement investigator/negotiator, whose sole responsibility \nwill be to police our trading partners' performance of their \nobligations.\n  This bill will force China to stop manipulating its currency and \nforce China to choose between revaluing its currency to its market \nvalue or face a tough tariff on all Chinese imports to the United \nStates, equal to the unfair trade advantage China currently enjoys.\n  Let me give you an example of what I think is important. There are \nmany in Michigan, but let me share this. I met with a group of people \nfrom Rexair Company in Cadillac, MI, a couple of weeks ago. They \nproduce vacuum cleaners. The company's vice president claimed that the \nChinese-made motors for the vacuum cleaners are cheaper because of \ncurrency manipulation. The motor is $28.80 in the United States and \n$21.30 in China. The company would prefer to use U.S.-made motors, but \nthey have to go with the lower cost alternative in order to be \ncompetitive. There is no reason for that difference, except for \ncurrency manipulation.\n  When jobs are moved overseas it doesn't just hurt individuals, it \nhurts families, communities like Greenville, MI, and it hurts all of \nus. Trade adjustment assistance has helped thousands of manufacturing \nworkers get retraining, keep their health insurance, and make a new \nstart. This bill will expand TAA to cover service workers who lose \ntheir jobs when companies move jobs overseas. It will also provide \nhealth coverage for unemployed workers who are in training programs so \nthat they can complete their training and help rebuild communities \naffected by outsourcing or exporting jobs, by coordinating Federal, \nState, and local resources to develop a new plan and a new future for \nthe people who live there. We have a ceiling of a national debt, but we \ndon't have a ceiling on the U.S. foreign debt, or the annual trade \ndeficits that feed it. That is wrong. It is irresponsible, particularly \nif you consider that America is now the world's largest debtor nation.\n  We will have serious consequences if our trade deficits continue. In \nthe 109th Congress we are going to change that and put America on the \npath of a more responsible approach. Our bill will require the \nadministration to convene an emergency interagency meeting and provide \nCongress with a trade deficit reduction plan, to lower debt levels \nbelow the statutory ceiling, whenever the overall foreign debt reaches \n25 percent of our GDP or when the annual trade deficit reaches 5 \npercent of GDP.\n\n  Another component of expanding opportunity for everybody is to \nprovide our children with the best education possible. We talk a lot \nabout that. We have an opportunity in the 109th Congress to put in \nplace those opportunities and mean it for our children.\n  That is why we are going to keep our promise to our children by \nincreasing support for preschool education, fully funding No Child Left \nBehind, and improving its implementation.\n  We are committed to finally meeting the Federal commitment to \nchildren with disabilities. How long have we talked about that on the \nSenate floor?\n  We will also address the shortfall of math, science, and special \neducation teachers by creating tuition incentives for college students \nto major in these critical fields. We will help expand educational \nopportunities for college by providing relief from skyrocketing college \ntuition, increasing the size and access to Pell grants, and supporting \nproven programs that encourage more young people to attend and succeed \nin college.\n  We will also work to make health care more affordable. Spiraling \nhealth care costs are putting the opportunity of America at risk, \nmaking it harder for families to buy health insurance and placing a \ndifficult burden on our small and large businesses, our manufacturers, \ncertainly.\n  We will address these concerns by making prescription drugs more \naffordable. How often have I spoken about this on the Senate floor? We \nwill make prescription drugs more affordable through the legalization \nof prescription drug reimportation--in other words, allowing the \npharmacists in America, in\n\n[[Page S132]]\n\nMichigan, to do business with pharmacists across the border in Canada \nand in other places where we know it can be done safely.\n  In our legislation, we will be making sure prescription drugs are \nsafe by ensuring that drugs are monitored after they are approved for \nuse. We will ensure all children and pregnant women will have health \ncare. We understand how critical it is that we protect Medicaid and \nwork with the States across this country to make sure that health care \nis available through Medicaid.\n  We will also reduce the growing cost of health care to small \nbusinesses by offering tax credits, while also modernizing health care \nto cut costs for patients and businesses.\n  While we are lowering health care costs, we are going to revamp the \nlast Congress' Medicare bill--if we have the opportunity to do so, that \nis certainly our wish as Democrats--and take the special interests out \nof the Medicare bill by repealing the provision that makes no sense at \nall that prevents Medicare from negotiating the best possible price for \nour seniors.\n  While we will eliminate the slush fund for HMOs, we will also improve \nthe prescription drug benefit by phasing out the current coverage gap \nwhere seniors pay a premium but do not get a benefit.\n  I am told that if, in fact, we negotiated in Medicare the same price \ncuts that we do through the VA for the veterans, we would not have a \ngap in the Medicare prescription drug law at all. There would not be a \ngap in benefit. We need to make that change so our seniors have the \nvery best possible Medicare prescription drug benefit.\n\n  We as Democrats will work to lower Part B premiums so premium \nincreases are not as steep as the one that took effect in January. We \nwill address incentives that encourage employers to drop retiree \nbenefits and ensure that our seniors will not be forced into HMOs while \nother seniors transition into a new benefit.\n  In the United States, the foundation of our incredible democracy is \nthe fundamental right to vote. That is another important part of the \nlegislative package we have put forward today. It does not matter if \none is rich or poor, black, brown or white, all Americans have the \nright to one vote. It is the great equalizer. When one is voting and \nwalks out of the voting booth, each one of us walks out as an equal. \nUnfortunately, we have had major problems in our voting systems in the \nlast few elections, as we all know. We have determined, as Democrats, \nto reform the voting system in this country to create Federal standards \nfor our elections and to be able to add verification, accountability, \nand accuracy to this system. Together we should be moving as quickly as \npossible to do this.\n  Our legislation increases access to the polls with election day \nregistration, shorter lines, early voting. The bill also aims to \nmodernize our election equipment and increase impartiality and provides \nthe resources to our States to implement the bill.\n  While our agenda is ambitious, we have a plan to pay for every single \ninitiative we are proposing at the beginning of this session, our \nvision of keeping America's promise.\n  Unfortunately, in the past 4 years, colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle and the administration have turned a large surplus, in fact \nthe largest surplus in the history of the country, into the largest \ndebt. We know that fiscal mismanagement today only leads to greater \nproblems for our children and our grandchildren. It is our \nresponsibility to address the fiscal irresponsibility of the current \nadministration by imposing discipline today and we invite our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle to make that a new priority, \na fresh priority, in this new Congress. We are united to strengthen our \nbudgeting rules that require the Government to live within its means.\n  The bottom line is that we today, the first day, we can introduce \nbills in the new session, have come together as Democrats to put \nforward our vision of keeping the promise of America. It is rooted in \nsecurity. We must be safe. Our families must be safe. We must make sure \nwe are providing all that we must for our troops and those who have \nserved us and are now our veterans.\n  We are also committed to creating opportunity for everyone who works \nhard and plays by the rules, cares about their children, to create \nopportunity to be successful. We want everyone to dream big dreams and \nbe able to reach for the stars and touch them and be successful within \nthe American dream.\n  We also understand that when we create opportunity, with that comes \nresponsibility. We each have responsibility to step up and work hard, \nbut we also know we have responsibility for each other. We have \nresponsibilities as parents to our children to create the security they \nneed, the opportunity they need, and to instill responsibility in them, \nand that as a community we have responsibility one to another, just as \nwe do for our family, and our country has a responsibility to make sure \nthose opportunities are present.\n  This is an important day. It is the beginning of the new session, a \nnew opportunity. We stand ready to work with the administration and our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle to truly keep the promise of \nAmerica, not just for some but for everyone in our country who is \nworking hard every day and counting on us to make sure that dream is \navailable and that promise is kept for them and their families.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/24/senate-section/article/S132-1", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S132-S134]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           PRESCRIPTION DRUGS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, many people recall that over a year ago \nthere was a debate on the Senate floor about the cost of prescription \ndrugs. It was a lengthy debate, and it involved a lot of concern about \nthe fact that a lot of senior citizens find the life-protecting drugs \nthey are taking to be too expensive.\n\n  We have known for a long time that Medicare, a very valuable Federal \nGovernment program, has been more than miraculous in its results. When \nit was instituted during the term of President Lyndon Johnson, there \nwas hope it would help seniors pay for their medical bills and improve \nthe quality of their lives. It has done that and more. It has become an \nextremely valuable program because seniors have used Medicare for \naccess to doctors and hospitals, and the proof is in longevity. Seniors \nare living longer. They are getting better medical care. It was truly \none of the best Government programs ever created, but there was a gap \nin those programs. It didn't cover prescription drugs for those who \nwere not in the hospital. So seniors found that new drugs that kept \nthem healthy and out of the hospital were too expensive. Some couldn't \ntake the drugs because they couldn't afford them. Others had to make \nterrible life choices between their lifesaving drugs and basic \nnecessities of life.\n  For a long time we have talked about establishing under Medicare a \nprescription drug program that would help these seniors--and disabled \npeople, who also qualify under Medicare. The debate got started, and it \nlooked promising. There was the belief that we were finally moving to a \ngoal that we have talked about for a long time. Unfortunately, during \nthe course of the debate there were political forces at work in \nWashington. That is not unusual. The largest political force at work \nwas the pharmaceutical drug industry. They understood that if we gave \nto Medicare the power to bargain for senior citizens in America, that \npower would force the drug companies to reduce their cost, so the \npharmaceutical companies, one of the most powerful lobbying \norganizations in Washington, successfully lobbied the Bush \nadministration and supporters of the bill to prohibit Medicare from \ncreating a drug benefit program under Medicare which would hold the \ndrug companies accountable for cost increases.\n  They got the best of both worlds. They not only could continue to \nsell expensive drugs to seniors, there is no pressure on them to reduce \nthe cost. Drug companies are very profitable, and they understood that \nwith this change in the law, they would continue to make enormous sums \nof money off of seniors and the Government for a long time to come.\n  Some of us who voted against the program as presented by the \nPresident suggested that, unless there was some cost containment here, \nthis program would break the bank; it would cost too much; drug prices \nwould go up, and\n\n[[Page S133]]\n\nthe Federal Government could not appropriate money fast enough to take \ncare of it.\n  Then they started describing the prescription drug program, and it \nquickly reached the point that even a Harvard trained lawyer couldn't \nunderstand what it was all about. I have sat down with seniors in \nIllinois and tried to explain to them what this prescription drug plan \nwas all about, and after a while they threw up their hands and said: \nSenator, wasn't there an easier way to do this? And the honest answer \nwas: Yes, but we didn't choose that easier way.\n  Because of some budgetary considerations and \npolitical considerations, we created an extremely complicated program \nfor senior citizens. That program ultimately did not reach a point \nwhere seniors approved of it. In fact, most of the seniors in Illinois \nwho I talked to are not only skeptical of this program, they are \ncritical of it. They are not sure it would really help them.\n\n  The administration--the President--was very smart. He decided to \npostpone the startup of this program until after the last election. He \nknew, and I am sure we all do now, that when this program starts a lot \nof seniors are going to see just how bad it is, how complicated it is, \nhow uncertain it is, and because of those uncertainties many of them \nwill be critical of the Congress that enacted the law and the President \nwho presented it to us for enactment.\n  So at this point we have a problem before us, a program that is about \nto go into effect which has uncertain monthly premiums, has a so-called \ndonut hole, which means it covers drugs up to a certain point in their \ncost and then leaves the individual senior citizens on their own for a \nperiod of time as they spend the money out of pocket and then comes \nback to cover them again. It also has some curious provisions where \nseniors cannot buy supplemental insurance to make up the deficiencies \nin the prescription drug bill. They are banned, prohibited. It also \nexpressly says Medicare cannot create its own prescription drug company \nand bargain for senior citizens--once again to protect the \nprofitability of pharmaceutical companies.\n  As bad as this bill was, we were waiting for the regulations written \nby the Bush administration which would spell out the details of how \nthis process will work. Last Friday the Bush administration released \n1,500 pages of new rules and regulations related to the new Medicare \nprescription drug program--1,500 pages. I can remember when President \nReagan showed up for the State of the Union Address with a huge copy of \na bill we had just passed, an appropriations bill, slamming it on the \ndesk saying what an embarrassment it was to the American people that we \nwould have a bill of such complexity and magnitude. Here we have the \nregulations for the prescription drug bill, an already complicated \nbill, 1,500 pages in length. When you look at the details of this \nprescription drug benefit, you understand why many senior citizens are \nskeptical.\n  Sally Mitchell is a 66-year-old widow who lives in Aurora, IL, and \ntakes three prescription medications every day. She told the Chicago \nTribune that she:\n\n     wished Medicare would come up with something that would be \n     easier for people to understand and use.\n\n  That is not an unreasonable request from Mrs. Mitchell. In her words, \nshe went on to say:\n\n       If it's too much work and too much stress, at my age it's \n     not worth it for me to just save a couple of dollars.\n\n  That is what many senior citizens have found. As this administration \ncame forward with discount cards and prescription drug benefits, a lot \nof them have said it is not going to work.\n  When you take a hard look at the philosophy driving this complicated \nbill, protecting this private interest group, you get further insight \ninto the concept of the ownership society. This is the new concept. \nThis is the brave new world we are hearing about, which says that \nbasically the Government should not be making certain that there \nis competition for these drug companies. Let them own their products. \nLet them sell their products. The Government should not be standing in \nthe shoes of the senior citizens who need these prescription drugs, \nunderstanding the complexity of the system and the cost of the system. \nNo, no, the Government should step aside. Let the seniors own the \nprogram.\n\n  I believe a lot of seniors are going to disown the program. The \nPresident tells us that turning America into ``an ownership society'' \nwill solve our retirement security problems. Just privatize part of \nSocial Security and give Medicare beneficiaries a voucher so they can \nbuy private prescription drug coverage and the problems are solved.\n  But I think seniors see through this. They understand that what they \nare hearing from the administration about Social Security and Medicare \ndoes not give them peace of mind. If there are challenges in Social \nSecurity, they are in the distant future, as I said in an earlier floor \nstatement: 37 years from now. If we are to make changes, they should be \nchanges that don't cut the benefits for Social Security retirees and \nbeneficiaries. They should not create an additional national debt of $2 \ntrillion or more, but that is the projection coming out of the \nPresident's suggestions.\n  We will wait for the details. In fairness to the President, he should \npresent this to us in its entirety. It is an interesting theory to \nthink that we can start privatizing Medicare, Social Security, Medicare \nprescription drug programs, but here is the reality: 1,500 pages of \nregulatory gobbledygook, big guaranteed profits for the pharmaceutical \nindustry and the HMOs and insurance companies, and precious little \nsavings for people like Sally Mitchell of Aurora, IL.\n  Why is this all so complicated and so costly? Because when the \nMedicare prescription drug benefit was designed, it was with the \npharmaceutical companies and the HMOs in mind, not the seniors of \nAmerica. Instead of simply offering a prescription drug benefit through \nMedicare and negotiating bulk prices, we divided the country into 34 \npharmaceutical regions. This is a map that shows these regions. We are \ngoing to have to spend $300 million to explain to seniors what region \nthey live in and who is going to offer prescription drug coverage in \neach of these regions.\n  Do you remember when there was a discussion about the Clinton \nproposal for dealing with the cost of health care? Senator Dole and \nothers came to the Senate floor with this flowchart which showed a \nspaghetti mess of lines going every single direction. That applies as \nwell to this prescription drug benefit from the Bush administration. \nEach of the 34 regions on the map that I just showed you will have at \nleast 2 private options for prescription drugs, either a prescription \ndrug plan or an HMO. If there are two plans in each region, it means \ninstead of the Secretary of Health and Human Services negotiating on \nbehalf of 41 million seniors for lower drug prices, pharmaceutical \ncompanies will be negotiating with 68 private companies on behalf of \nseniors.\n  Think about your negotiating power at the table when you divide the \nnumber of seniors by 68 instead of having Medicare bargaining on behalf \nof all 40 million-plus seniors. Simple economics tells you, you lose \nyour negotiating power when the number of people you are representing \ngoes down, as the power of the pharmaceutical companies goes up.\n  What is worse is that private plans can change their drug formularies \nafter seniors sign up, but the seniors are locked into it. That is \nright. If you decide you need to sign up for a prescription drug plan \nthe President is proposing, and one of these companies decides it is \ngoing to stop carrying the drug that the doctor told you that you \nneeded, you are still stuck with that prescription drug program you \nsigned up for. So if you do your research and decide on a plan in your \narea because it offers a low price for a drug you are taking, you are \nlocked into that plan, but it can drop coverage of your drug during the \nyear.\n  The regulations released on Friday also govern bidding by HMOs \nwanting to contract with Medicare. The HMOs are divided into 26 \nregions. Although most seniors are happy to receive their benefits \ndirectly through Medicare, we will spend $14 billion over the next 10 \nyears to expand coverage by HMOs. The Republicans who passed this \nargued that the HMOs and private insurance companies could do things \nmore effectively and efficiently.\n  Yet we have built into this proposal a Federal subsidy of millions, \nif not billions, of dollars to the HMOs to reward them for competing. \nSomething is\n\n[[Page S134]]\n\nwrong with this picture. If they are supposed to be so efficient, why \ndo they make it a Federal subsidy? The sponsor of the bill couldn't \nexplain it. The private plans are 7 to 9 percent more expensive than \nMedicare fees for service and less efficient. And we are going to \nsubsidize it so they can compete with whatever Medicare has to offer?\n  PacifiCare CEO Howard Phanstiel told Bloomberg News over the weekend: \n``We are encouraged that CMS continues to demonstrate its commitment to \nbe a good business partner with the private sector.'' But isn't it \nGovernment agencies' first obligation to seniors and the citizens of \nthis country rather than to the businesses that will profit from this \nnew arrangement?\n  Let us take a look at Mr. Phanstiel and his colleagues in the HMO \nindustry. He made more than $3 million in the year 2003, the year we \npassed the Medicare bill. As a result of this bill, many companies and \nmany others like it will probably make even more because Mr. \nPhanstiel's company will have access to some 700,000 Medicare \nbeneficiaries in addition to the ones he currently serves.\n  When you look at compensation, the CEO of Aetna, $8.9 million; Larry \nGlassock's compensation, $6.8 million. Here is one CEO who earned $21.6 \nmillion. Look at what these HMO CEOs are making. And now we are not \ngoing to cut into their profits but increase them.\n  When Mr. Phanstiel sent this nice thank-you note to CMS, a Federal \nagency, and said they are continuing to demonstrate their commitment to \nbe a good business partner, it means even more money and profits for \nthe HMOs at the expense of senior citizens.\n  When it comes to pharmaceutical companies, this chart tells you what \nhappened to the Fortune 500 companies in America. This is the analysis \nof the 2002 profits. Look, if you will, at the return on revenues. The \nNo. 1 industry, pharmaceuticals; return on assets, No. 1 industry, \npharmaceuticals.\n  When you turn on the television and you can't escape another ad for \nthe ``little purple pill,'' let me tell you that company is spending \nmore money on advertising than it is on research to find new drugs. \nThey are trying to create an appetite and desire among American \nconsumers to buy drugs they don't need; too expensive drugs, I might \nadd. In this situation, you are going to find pharmaceutical companies \ndoing even much better because the Medicare prescription drug plan says \nthey don't have to compete.\n  Is the idea of asking drug companies to reduce their costs to help \npeople under Federal programs a radical, Socialist, Communist, \ncollectivistic idea? I don't think so. Go to the Veterans' \nAdministration. That is exactly what they do. They call in the drug \ncompanies and say: We have a lot of veterans in America who are going \nto VA hospitals to pick up their drugs through a program we are \noffering. If you want to sell drugs to them, you have to give us your \nbest price. And the American drug companies line up and reduce their \ncosts for VA. They don't scream and they don't holler and squirm away. \nThey like to deal. And the VA serves the veterans. Why is it we can't \ndo the same thing for Medicare? It is just that simple.\n  The fact that we didn't is the reason the administration last Friday \nhad to put 1,500 pages of regulations together on an already \ncomplicated bill to try to explain the Medicare prescription drug \nbenefit that is, frankly, not what it should be. We started off \nunderstanding the need. We passed a bill that didn't meet that need. \nNow, in the name of the ownership society, we are saying to people: You \nown the right to be virtually defenseless in bargaining with \npharmaceutical companies and HMOs.\n  Is that what we are here for--to make certain their profitability \ngoes through the roof at the expense of seniors who can't afford \nlifesaving drugs? I don't think so.\n  The time will come--and I hope soon--when we will have reforms of \nthis Medicare prescription drug program. When we do, let us keep our \nfirst obligation to our seniors.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/24/senate-section/article/S134-1", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S134-S136]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                     sergeant thomas eugene houser\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise in remembrance of a brave Iowan \nwho has left his countrymen to join the ranks of those who have paid \nthe highest price in the defense of freedom. Sergeant Thomas Eugene \nHouser was a native of Council Bluffs, IA and was killed on January 3, \n2005, in action against enemy forces in the Al Anbar Province of Iraq. \nHe was twenty-two years old.\n  An active young man, SGT Houser participated in football, wrestling, \nand track while attending St. Albert's Catholic High School and is \nremembered by his family and friends as a compassionate soul who, as \nhis mother says, could ``talk to anyone.'' As a boy, he dreamed of \nfollowing in the tradition of military service set by his father and \ngrandfather, a dream which he fulfilled courageously as a member of the \n1st Marine Division.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me and all Iowans in remembering SGT \nHouser. My prayers go out to his family and friends who feel his loss \nso deeply. Such men as Thomas Houser inspire us to hold in ever higher \nesteem the ideals of freedom and service. His valor shall certainly not \nbe forgotten.\n\n\n                   Private First Class Gunnar Becker\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to PFC Gunnar \nBecker, a member of the United States Army, who died on January 13, \n2005, while serving in Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n  PFC Becker was a member of the 63rd Armored Regiment, 1st Infantry \nDivision.\n  Answering America's call to the military, PFC Becker joined the U.S. \nArmy shortly after graduating from Artesian-Letcher High School in \n2003. His friends remember him as a good-natured, outgoing person with \nboundless enthusiasm and confidence to match. Kelvin Peterson, a good \nfriend remembers him as always being able to put a smile on people's \nfaces. Kelvin said, ``He knew how to make a person laugh and have a \ngood time, because that's what he was all about, having a good time.''\n  PFC Becker served our country and, as a hero, died as a proud member \nof our Armed Forces. He served as a model of the loyalty and dedication \nthat comes with preservation of freedom. The thoughts and prayers of my \nfamily, as well as our Nation's, are with his family during this time \nof mourning. As well, our thoughts continue to be with all those \nfamilies who have children, spouses, parents, and other loved ones \nserving overseas.\n  PFC Becker lived life to the fullest and was committed to his family, \nhis Nation, and his community. It was his incredible dedication to \nhelping others that will serve as his greatest legacy. Our Nation is a \nfar better place because of PFC Becker's contributions, and, while his \nfamily, friends, and Nation will miss him very much, the best way to \nhonor his life is to remember his commitment to service and his family.\n  I join with all South Dakotans in expressing my sympathies to the \nfriends and the family of PFC Becker. I know that he will always be \nmissed, but his service to our Nation will never be forgotten.\n\n\n       Specialists Jimmy Buie, Joshua Marcum and Jeremy McHalffey\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President. I rise today to honor the lives of three \nbrave Arkansans and to pay tribute to the sacrifice they made on behalf \nof our freedom. Jimmy Buie, Joshua Marcum, and Jeremy McHalffey were \nall beloved by their families, admired by their friends, and respected \nwithin their communities. Today, they are remembered as heroes by the \ngrateful Nation for whom they gave their lives.\n  SPCs Buie, Marcum, and McHalffey were proud members of the Arkansas \nNational Guard's 39th Infantry Brigade. Together, they served with the \n2nd platoon of Bravo Company, 3rd Battalion of the 39th, a close-knit \ngroup who quickly earned a reputation for dependability and whose \nsoldiers were known to do absolutely anything for each other. This was \nespecially true for SPC Marcum, SPC McHalffey, and SPC Buie, who were \nall roommates at their company's base at Camp Gunslinger, just north of \nBaghdad.\n  It was obvious to those who served with them that in addition to \nbeing outstanding soldiers, these three men were so much more. While \nthe easy-going SPC Buie and SPC Marcum could always be counted on to \nbrighten a mood with their humor and infectious smiles, the hard-\ncharging SPC\n\n[[Page S135]]\n\nMcHalffey often motivated his colleagues with his determination and \nfocus. While the three had differing approaches to their service, they \nwere united in the belief that they were doing what was right; helping \nrebuild the lives of a people they had never met and bringing stability \nto a nation they had never known.\n  SPC Buie joined the military upon his graduation from high school in \n1980. Later, while working for a dental products manufacturer, he met a \nwoman named Lisa who would become the love of his life. The two were \ninseparable, and the natural chemistry between them soon led to \nmarriage. SPC Buie quickly took to Lisa's two sons and found great \npleasure in spending time with them, whether they were building a go-\ncart or playing catch.\n  In his hometown of Batesville, SPC Buie worked as a mechanic at Mark \nMartin Ford Mercury, where he rightfully earned the reputation of a \nquiet, hard-working guy who always got the job done. He joined the \nNational Guard in August of 2004 and was deployed to Iraq after \nspending a month of training at Fort Hood, Texas. While serving in \nIraq, he spoke with Lisa every Sunday evening. During these \nconversations, he always remained upbeat and spoke of the joy he found \nin improving the lives of Iraqis, particularly the local farmers, whom \nhe pitied for their poor living conditions. These words and actions \nspoke volumes of SPC Buie, a humble man who found comfort in knowing \nfolks were praying for him back in Arkansas, and who used that \ninspiration to improve the lives of those around him.\n  SPC Marcum was from the small northern Arkansas town of Evening \nShade, where he lived with his wife, Lisa, and their five children. \nFriends and family describe him as one of the nicest people you could \never meet, a unique individual who disliked cursing, avoided arguments, \nand had a special calming effect on those around him. He was also the \ntype of person who found pleasure in bringing joy to others; a gift of \nhis that was attributable to his sense of humor and his loving heart.\n  While serving in Iraq, SPC Marcum, who had always wanted to be a \nsoldier, was remembered by his comrades as a quiet guy who naturally \nwent out of his way to lend a helping hand to those in need. He kept in \nfrequent contact with his wife throughout his deployment and sought to \ncomfort her by keeping her up to date on his welfare and relaying his \npositive experiences along the way. With his time in Iraq nearing its \nend, he was looking forward to returning to his friends and family back \nin Arkansas and often spoke of taking a float trip down the Spring \nRiver soon after.\n  SPC McHalffey was born in the small northeastern Arkansas town of \nParagould but later moved to Springfield, MO, where he graduated from \nhigh school in 1995. Throughout his life, he had a love for the \noutdoors and if you ever needed to find him during hunting season, he \nwas most likely in the woods with his father, looking for turkey or \ndeer. At the age of 18, he joined the United States Marine Corps, and \nwould proudly serve for 4 years. Upon his return to Springfield, he \nworked for the Greene County Sheriff's Office and later for Showcase \nBuilding Supply. In 2002, he met a dispatcher named Lacy Tindele at a \nfirefighters' training camp. The couple quickly fell in love and their \nengagement soon followed.\n  SPC McHalffey's deep love for his country is what originally \nmotivated him to enlist in the Marine Corps and it is also what later \nmotivated him to serve in Iraq. As his brother Mike reflected, ``He was \nthe type of guy to volunteer. If something needed to be done, Jeremy \nwould jump in.'' SPC McHalffey initially wanted to re-enlist in the \nMarines but was told the process could take months. As a result, he and \nLacy chose to move to Little Rock, to continue his career in law \nenforcement and to join the Arkansas National Guard, because he was \ntold it had a significantly shorter waiting time. The couple chose the \nnearby community of Mabelvale, where SPC McHalffey commuted to his new \njob as a detention deputy at the Pulaski County Jail until his \ndeployment. Lacy spent much of her time planning the couple's small \nwedding, which was to take place upon her fiancee's return from Iraq in \na few months.\n  The lives of these three Arkansas soldiers was forever intertwined \nwhen, tragically, they were killed on January 4 when their humvee was \nstruck by a roadside bomb. Their vehicle, which was traveling as part \nof a convoy, was leaving an Iraqi National Guard bunker in the al-Shaab \ndistrict of Baghdad. The loss of these heroes will be felt by not only \ntheir comrades in Iraq, but by the many friends and loved ones they \nhave left behind.\n  At the memorial service of SPC Marcum, Linda Beckham reflected on her \nbrother; ``He wanted to honor his country. It was his dream and he \nfulfilled it.'' These words ring true not only for SPC Marcum, but also \nfor SPC McHalffey and SPC Buie. The courageous and selfless way in \nwhich they served in uniform brings honor to our Nation. The \nimpassioned and generous way in which they led their lives, brings \nhonor to us all.\n  On behalf of a grateful Nation, my thoughts and prayers go out to the \nfamily and friends of Jimmy Buie, Joshua Marcum, and Jeremy McHalffey. \nAlthough they may no longer be with us, we must find some solace \nknowing that they died for a cause in which they believed. Their legacy \nand their spirit will forever live on in our hearts.\n\n\n                       Army Private Cory R. Depew\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart and deep \nsense of gratitude to honor the life of a brave young man from Beech \nGrove. Army PVT Cory R. Depew, 21 years old, died on January 4 when the \nStryker military vehicle he was riding in was struck by rocket-\npropelled grenades just west of Mosul, Iraq. With his entire life \nbefore him, Cory risked everything to fight for the values Americans \nhold close to our hearts, in a land halfway around the world.\n  After graduating from high school, Cory went on to pursue a dream he \nhad been working toward since he was in the eighth grade. In September \nof 2003, Cory made his dream a reality by enlisting in the United \nStates Army. Cory's mother, Sheryl Ann, recalled her son's determined \nspirit when speaking to the Indianapolis Star saying, ``He was going to \nthe military, he wanted to serve his country. . . . He was a hero. He \ngave his life for this country.''\n  Cory was the 44th Hoosier soldier to be killed while serving his \ncountry in Operation Iraqi Freedom. He was assigned to the 2nd \nSquadron, 14th Calvary Regiment, 1st Brigade, 25th Infantry Division, \nbased in Fort Lewis, Washington. This brave young soldier leaves behind \nhis mother, Sheryl Ann May; his son, Brendan Favre; his brothers, Wyatt \nand Elliot; and his grandfather, Austin Hall.\n  Today, I join Cory's family, his friends and the entire Beech Grove \ncommunity in mourning his death. While we struggle to bear our sorrow \nover this loss, we can also take pride in the example he set, bravely \nfighting to make the world a safer place. It is his courage and \nstrength of character that people will remember when they think of \nCory, a memory that will burn brightly during these continuing days of \nconflict and grief.\n  Cory was known for his dedication to family and his love of country. \nWhen reflecting on Cory's life, his mother told the Indianapolis Star \nthat her son's best attributes had been on display while he was home on \na two-week leave only a few months ago, ``his `wise guy' sense of \nhumor, his love of children, his hard work.'' During his short break, \nCory spent time playing with his son, Branden and volunteered to help \nbuild a new garden at his church, a place where his mother and many \nothers now go to find solace. Today and always, Cory will be remembered \nby family members, friends and fellow Hoosiers as a true American hero \nand we honor the sacrifice he made while dutifully serving his country.\n  As I search for words to do justice in honoring Cory's sacrifice, I \nam reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the families \nof the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: ``We cannot dedicate, we cannot \nconsecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and \ndead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power \nto add or detract.

This statement \nis just as true today as it was\n\n[[Page S136]]\n\nnearly 150 years ago, as I am certain that the impact of Cory's actions \nwill live on far longer than any record of these words.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Cory R. Depew in the official \nrecord of the United States Senate for his service to this country and \nfor his profound commitment to freedom, democracy and peace. When I \nthink about this just cause in which we are engaged, and the \nunfortunate pain that comes with the loss of our heroes, I hope that \nfamilies like Cory's can find comfort in the words of the prophet \nIsaiah who said, ``He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord \nGod will wipe away tears from off all faces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be \nwith all of you, as I know He is with Cory.\n\n\n                     Lance Corporal Eric Hillenburg\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart and deep \nsense of gratitude to honor the life of a brave young man from \nHendricks County. LCpl Eric Hillenburg, twenty-one years old, died on \nDecember 23 during a patrol when he was struck by small-arms fire in \nFallujah. With his entire life before him, Eric risked everything to \nfight for the values Americans hold close to our hearts, in a land \nhalfway around the world.\n  After graduating from Chapel Hill Christian School with honors, Eric \nwent on to become a Marine, a dream he first set his sight on at the \nyoung age of 14. According to family and friends, Eric followed a long-\nstanding tradition of service as his family has proudly served our \ncountry in every conflict since the Civil War. When reflecting upon the \nloss of his son to members of his congregation at Hope Baptist Church, \nRev. Hillenburg expressed his deep sense of pride and patriotism \nsaying, ``When I see that flag flying from now on, it will mean more to \nme than ever before. . . . When I see a young man in uniform, he will \nbe my son.'' According to the Indianapolis Star, the congregation stood \nand applauded these heartfelt remarks. I stand here today to express \nthe same sentiments of gratitude for Eric's sacrifices and for those \nmade by the entire Hillenburg family on behalf of our country.\n  Eric was the 43rd Hoosier soldier to be killed while serving his \ncountry in Operation Iraqi Freedom. He was assigned to the 3rd \nBattalion, 5th Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Division, I Marine \nExpeditionary Force, Camp Pendleton, California. This brave young \nsoldier leaves behind his mother, Pamela; his father, Jerry; his \nsister, Erin; and his brother, Evin.\n  Today, I join Eric's family, his friends and the entire Indianapolis \ncommunity in mourning his death. While we struggle to bear our sorrow \nover this loss, we can also take pride in the example he set, bravely \nfighting to make the world a safer place. It is his courage and \nstrength of character that people will remember when they think of \nEric, a memory that will burn brightly during these continuing days of \nconflict and grief.\n  Eric was known for his dedication to family and his love of country. \nToday and always, Eric will be remembered by family members, friends \nand fellow Hoosiers as a true American hero and we honor the sacrifice \nhe made while dutifully serving his country.\n  As I search for words to do justice in honoring Eric's sacrifice, I \nam reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the families \nof the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: ``We cannot dedicate, we cannot \nconsecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and \ndead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power \nto add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we \nsay here, but it can never forget what they did here.'' This statement \nis just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, as I am certain \nthat the impact of Eric's actions will live on far longer than any \nrecord of these words.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Eric Hillenburg in the \nofficial record of the United States Senate for his service to this \ncountry and for his profound commitment to freedom, democracy and \npeace.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the latest \ndevelopments regarding the Canadian softwood lumber dispute. With yet \nanother curious and ultimately inconsequential lumber unfair trade \ndetermination due today at the behest of a NAFTA dispute panel, it is \nimportant to place this matter in proper perspective.\n  Would the distinguished Senator from Montana and my colleague from \nIdaho engage in a colloquy with me concerning the Canadian softwood \nlumber dispute?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I would be pleased to engage in such a colloquy.\n  Mr. CRAPO. I would also like to join my colleagues in a colloquy on \nthis matter.\n  Mr. CRAIG. The Commerce Department has found repeatedly that Canadian \nlumber is subsidized and dumped. World Trade Organization and NAFTA \ndispute settlement panels have definitively rejected Canada's long-time \narguments that its underpricing of timber cannot be deemed a subsidy. \nThe panels have also upheld findings that Canadian lumber is unfairly \ndumped in the U.S. market. The International Trade Commission has found \nrepeatedly that the unfair imports threaten our industry with harm.\n  President Bush was well prepared to answer the Canadian Prime \nMinister when they last met. The President told the Prime Minister that \nthe problem of subsidies and dumping is caused by Canada, and the \nsolution lies with Canada, unless Canada wants the solution to be \npermanent duties to offset the subsidies and the dumping. In over two \ndecades, Canadian officials have not gotten the message, at least not \nin a way that takes, that this problem will not be resolved by Canada's \ninvesting hundreds of millions of dollars in legal fees on more than 30 \nWashington law firms to circumvent U.S. laws in countless appeals to \nthe WTO, to NAFTA panels and to the U.S. courts--several more were \nfiled just this month. And it will not be solved by the cottage \nindustry that has grown up in Canada to mount PR campaigns in the \nUnited States.\n  The U.S. timber industry vigorously supports the administration's \nview that the unfair Canadian lumber problem could most appropriately \nand productively be resolved through negotiations--although perhaps \nthere just ought to be permanent duties in place. But the U.S. timber \nindustry is taking the statesmanlike high road, and I support it. Some \nvested interests in Canada do not see this, and prefer endless \nlitigation, probably based on misguided advice that this will be \nproductive from those who have made a living defending Canadian \nsubsidies.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Specifically, the problem remains that the market is \ngrossly distorted by Canadian unfair trade practices. Absent \ntermination of or an offset to the unfair practices, the U.S. timber \nindustry will be severely impacted by subsidized and dumped Canadian \nimports. We in the Congress have been assured that those responsible in \nthe administration will not allow this further injury to our industry \noccur.\n  A solution can be either border measures imposed by the United States \nor Canadian border measures agreed to with the United States pending \nadequate Canadian timber policy reforms.\n  The Bush administration has concluded that the November 2004 \ndetermination of the International Trade Commission that Canadian \nimports threaten the U.S. industry with injury--the ``Section 129'' \ndetermination--represents an independent basis authorizing and \nnecessitating retention of the countervailing and antidumping duty \norders. The United States has faith in winning the NAFTA Extraordinary \nChallenge Committee proceeding on the injury issue, but even a negative \noutcome before the committee would not be the end of the matter.\n  The Bush administration has concluded that duty deposits, amounting \nto approximately $3 billion and growing daily, cannot and will not be \nreturned absent a negotiated settlement\n\n[[Page S137]]\n\nbetween the Canadian and U.S. Governments. The panels can provide \nprospective but not retroactive relief. In any event, these funds are \nrightly due under U.S. law to the injured domestic timber industry. If \nthere is a negotiated solution, the funds can be apportioned fairly as \npart of the settlement.\n  There is zero likelihood that the countervailing duty, antisubsidy, \norder will disappear absent settlement of the lumber subsidy and \ndumping issues, no matter how often a NAFTA panel tries to achieve this \noutcome.\n  The U.S. right to challenge Canadian log export restrictions at the \nWTO is clear under the WTO, and Canada is clearly in violation of its \nWTO obligations. I understand that the Bush administration is \nevaluating this issue.\n  I also understand that the U.S. timber industry intends to bring a \nconstitutional challenge to NAFTA dispute settlement if the lumber \ndumping issue is not resolved. The future of U.S. sawmills and \nmillworkers cannot be allowed to be ruined by outlandish decisionmaking \nby NAFTA dispute panels and a panelist's service with an obvious, \nundisclosed conflict of interest.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I agree completely with my colleagues. As suggested, a \nNAFTA dispute panel is requiring that the Commerce Department issue \ntoday yet another revised version of the original 2002 lumber-subsidy \ndetermination. Given the panel's pattern of overreaching, it may be a \nrelatively low subsidy estimate. If so, this will be trumpeted in \nheadlines across Canada as a victory for Canada's lumber policies. \nBefore all those editorial writers seize on this supposed ``victory,'' \nthey should understand that this determination will have absolutely no \nlegal effect. It is the Commerce Department's December 2004 findings of \na subsidy of over 17 percent and dumping of 4 percent that controls. \nHyping the January 24 decision as having any meaning performs a \ndisservice to Canadian interests, which lie in a mutually beneficial \nnegotiated settlement.\n  Nothing can change the facts. The Canadian provinces provide timber \nto their lumber companies for a fraction of its value. This harms not \nonly U.S. sawmills, millworkers and family forest landowners, but also \nthe Canadian forest. Environmental groups have long decried the \noverharvesting of timber caused by undervaluing the resource.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/24/senate-section/article/S137-1", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S137]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       WIND TRANSMISSION FUNDING\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise to discuss funding for a wind \ntransmission study that was included in the fiscal year 2005 Omnibus \nAppropriations bill signed into law last December. As a member of the \nSenate Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee, I appreciated the \nefforts of Senators Domenici and Reid, the chairman and the ranking \nmember of our subcommittee, to include $500,000 for the Western Area \nPower Administration, WAPA, to continue its work on the placement of \nadditional wind capacity in the Dakotas. They have generously provided \nfunding for similar work for the past two years, and I am glad these \nefforts will be continued during this coming fiscal year.\n  North Dakota is the ``Saudi Arabia'' of wind. The Department of \nEnergy has long identified North Dakota as having the greatest wind \nenergy resource and potential for wind generation development in the \nlower 48 States. During my time in the Senate, I have been pushing hard \non a number of fronts to develop our wind energy resources. For \nexample, I have been a strong supporter of the Renewable Portfolio \nStandard, RPS, which requires utilities to produce 10 percent of their \nelectricity from renewable energy sources by 2020. In addition, I \nbelieve the Federal Government should be a leader in this area and \ndevelop a policy of purchasing electricity from renewable energy \nsources.\n  Last February, I hosted the Fifth Annual Wind Energy Conference with \nthe Energy and Environmental Research Center at the University of North \nDakota to further promote this clean and limitless energy resource. \nWind energy stakeholders from around the Nation attended this \nsuccessful event, which attracted 436 people from 30 States and three \nCanadian provinces. Last year, the conference included a second day of \nevents because of the overwhelming interest in wind energy. As a result \nof the wind energy industry's growth, North Dakota's skyline and \neconomic future are forever changing and progressing forward. We will \nbe doing another conference in February 2005, which more broadly \nembraces renewable energy in the Upper Midwest.\n  Despite my continued efforts to increase the use of wind as an energy \nsource, North Dakota faces many transmission challenges in moving wind \nenergy to other parts of the country. I have held field hearings in \nNorth Dakota on these issues and have also supported the development of \nnew transmission technologies. While the Senate has wisely included \nfunding for the last several years for WAPA to make some progress on \nthese transmission problems, the fact remains that more needs to be \ndone. WAPA and others have done a number of general studies on this \nissue and I think the next steps are clear. WAPA should use the funding \nearmarked in FY2005 for an Environmental Impact Study, EIS, that would \nallow transmission expansion for wind generation to be placed in North \nand South Dakota and should use the remaining funds to support specific \ndemonstration projects in the region.\n  With respect to site-specific projects to support wind development \nfor future electric generation, I believe that WAPA should first \ndevelop parameters for determining what constitutes a bona fide wind \nproject. In doing this, WAPA should ensure that projects meet the \nfollowing requirements: a minimum period of at least one year; minimum \nanemometer height of at least 40 meters; multiple monitoring points \nallowing calculation of wind shear; a defined system interconnection \npoint and wind right easements adequate for the proposed project. To \nmake these limited funds stretch farther, I would expect any proposed \nproject to include a 50-50 cost share provision. It is my hope that \nWAPA will be able to support projects that will accurately determine \nthe transmission requirements and related costs associated with the \ninstallation of specific wind and coal generation projects.\n  Following this guidance, it is my expectation that WAPA will use this \nfunding to make real progress on these transmission problems in the \nnext fiscal year, and provide wider benefits to the large region of the \nU.S. served by WAPA. After all, WAPA was created to market hydropower, \na renewable energy resource. Wind is the next step.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/24/senate-section/article/S137-2", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S137-S138]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR A SOUND FUTURE ACT\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the Fiscal Responsibility for a Sound \nFuture Act, S. 19, would help restore budget discipline and fiscal \nresponsibility to our Nation's finances. Given the Federal budget's \ndramatic swing from record surplus to record deficit and debt over the \nlast few years, it is vital that we restore the strong budget \nenforcement mechanisms that have worked in the past.\n  This legislation would return us to a path of budget discipline by \nrestoring a strong pay-go rule, reinstating sequestration to enforce \npay-go and discretionary spending caps, and limiting the use of \nreconciliation to deficit reduction legislation.\n  The first step we should take to put our Nation's finances back in \norder is to stop digging the hole deeper. Restoring a strong pay-go \nrule would help to do exactly that. This legislation would restore the \nSenate pay-as-you-go rule to require that mandatory spending and tax \nlegislation be fully paid for, or be subject to a 60-vote point of \norder. Pay-go is one of the crucial budget enforcement tools that \nallowed the Federal Government to move from deficit to surplus in the \n1990s. Unfortunately, the Senate pay-go rule has been weakened in \nrecent years, in order to allow for passage of large tax cuts. Since \nthen, deficits and debt have skyrocketed.\n  In 2004, a Democratic amendment was adopted to the Senate Republican \nbudget resolution that would have restored a strong pay-go rule \nrequiring that both mandatory spending and tax cuts be paid for. \nHowever, the Republican leadership refused to accept a budget \nresolution conference agreement that contained the provision, so the \nbudget resolution was never adopted and the strong pay-go rule was \nnever brought into effect. The Fiscal Responsibility for a Sound Future \nAct\n\n[[Page S138]]\n\nwould end the current practice of exempting all mandatory spending and \ntax cuts assumed in the budget resolution from the pay-as-you-go rule, \nand extend the Senate pay-go rule currently set to expire in 2008 \nthrough fiscal year 2015.\n  The bill would also reinstate sequestration, across-the-board \nspending cuts, to enforce pay-go and discretionary spending limits. \nLegislation that exceeds fiscal year 2005 discretionary spending caps, \nas well as mandatory spending and tax legislation that would increase \nthe deficit, would trigger sequesters. The bill also expresses the \nsense of the Senate that a statutory discretionary spending limit \nshould be enacted for 2006 to prevent passing more debt on to our \nchildren.\n  The bill would also limit the use of the Senate's fast-track \n``reconciliation'' procedures, which cut off debate after only 20 \nhours, to deficit reduction legislation. Legislation that would \nincrease the deficit could still be considered in the Senate, but could \nnot be expedited using reconciliation procedures. This would restore \nreconciliation to its original purpose of deficit reduction, and ensure \nthat any legislation increasing deficits is subject to full scrutiny, \ndebate, and consideration in the Senate.\n  In addition, the legislation would prohibit the fast-tracking of \nCongressional budget resolutions that contain a reconciliation \ninstruction that would worsen the deficit. Any budget resolution that \nincludes an instruction to a committee to increase the deficit would be \nsubject to unlimited debate rather than limited to 50 hours.\n  We must return our Nation to a path of fiscal responsibility. We must \nput an end to these record deficits and record debt. This legislation \npresents a clear test of whether we are serious about putting our \nfiscal house back in order. I urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/24/senate-section/article/S138-1", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S138]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                THE PASSING OF NEBRASKA'S JOHNNY CARSON\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise to express my sympathy over the loss \nof Nebraska's Johnny Carson, the 30-year host of the ``Tonight Show'' \nand a dedicated Nebraska philanthropist. He passed away yesterday at \nthe age of 79 in his Malibu, CA home.\n  Johnny Carson was a Nebraska original and an American icon. He \nelevated the late night talk show to an art-form and he did it with \nclass and fun. Carson will be remembered as a generous individual who \nwas proud of his State.\n  After serving in the Navy during World War II, Carson attended the \nUniversity of Nebraska at Lincoln, UNL, and earned a bachelor of arts \ndegree in radio and speech. As a student, Carson practiced his comedy \nand perfected his ability to perform card and magic tricks. His \nexperiences at UNL greatly influenced his career in entertainment.\n  Carson made many significant contributions to Nebraska. Among them a \n$2.27 million donation to a cancer radiation center in Norfolk and last \nNovember, he donated $5.3 million to UNL to help with the renovation of \na building where he took classes.\n  I had the opportunity over the years to meet Carson. In 1967, he \nreturned to Nebraska for the State's Centennial celebration. He was \ninvited by the Governor to headline the gala with his former Omaha \nradio morning show co-host Harvey Swenson. Swenson was the manager of \nKLMS radio station in Lincoln, where I worked at the time. Carson came \nto the station and talked with all of us about his early days in \nNebraska radio.\n  After Carson graduated from high school, his parents moved from \nNorfolk to Columbus, NE, where I lived. I would occasionally see Carson \nwalking his dogs in Columbus when he would visit his parents during the \nsummers.\n  America will miss this good man, Johnny Carson. We are all very proud \nof him--of what he represented and where he came from. I ask my \ncolleagues to join me and all Americans in honoring Johnny Carson.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/24/senate-section/article/S138-2", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S138]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE 32ND ANNUAL MARCH FOR LIFE\n\n  Mr. HAGEL.

Mr. President, rising health care costs and access to \naffordable health insurance are among the biggest worries Americans \nface today.\n  Health care costs are increasing faster than any other basic service \nin American society. Today, 44 million Americans lack health insurance \nat any given point during the year, and between 20 to 30 million of \nthem are chronically uninsured.\n  My Republican colleagues and I will soon be introducing one of our \npriority bills for the coming Congress. This legislation, the Healthy \nAmerica Act of 2005, will bring together an aggressive and innovative \nset of health care solutions. These solutions build on the already \nimpressive health care record of the last Congress--principally \ndelivering Medicare prescription drug coverage to seniors and making \ntax-free health savings accounts available to all Americans.\n  Our bill will include many of President Bush's health care reform \npriorities, as well as the proposals developed last year by the Senate \nRepublican Task Force on Health Care Costs and the Uninsured, of which \nI was proud to be a member.\n  At the heart of this legislation are measures aimed at restraining \nhealth care costs, increasing access to care, and improving health care \nquality.\n  Toward this end, one of our--and the President's--topmost priorities \nis comprehensive reform of America's costly, unfair, and chaotic \nmedical liability system. Our bill will ensure fair and rapid \ncompensation to injured patients, reduce frivolous lawsuits, and limit \nexcessive and costly damage awards.\n  Also especially important, I believe, is the creation of a new \nnational framework for establishing personal electronic health records \nand for exchanging health information securely and privately. As the \nnew chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \nCommittee I will be working closely with my colleagues in the coming \nmonths to develop legislation that will speed the adoption of standards \nand enable systems to ``talk'' to each other--reforms that eventually \nwill save billions of dollars and, potentially, many thousands of \nlives.\n  Other critical features of this legislation include a commitment to \nreforming the struggling small group and individual health insurance \nmarkets, expanding the availability of health savings accounts, HSAs, \ncreating targeted tax credits to help Americans purchase private health \ninsurance, and expanding America's Community Health Centers and related \nfacilities.\n  Mr. President, this legislation will be a solid foundation and a \npromising beginning as we begin this new Congress. Together with my \ncolleagues and with the President, I will work tirelessly to assure \nthat health care costs, access, and quality are at the forefront of our \npriorities in the weeks and months ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/24/senate-section/article/S138-4", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S138-S139]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      CONFIRMATION OF MARGARET SPELLINGS AS SECRETARY OF EDUCATION\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for Ms. \nMargaret Spellings as our new Secretary of Education.\n  This is a key position at a key time. As I travel around the great \nState of\n\n[[Page S139]]\n\nUtah, there is no single issue area of greater concern than education. \nI am proud of the way Utah has been educating the children of my State. \nOur schools and teachers are among some of the best anywhere. Although \nwe spend less per student than many other States, we are getting a \ngreat bang for our buck.\n  As a strong supporter of education, I have been pleased to play an \nactive role in every piece of education reform legislation that has \ncome before the Congress in the past 28 years. I attended public \nschools, as did my children and now my grandchildren, and I have faith \nin our Nation's schools. I look forward to working closely with Ms. \nSpellings and the Department of Education, particularly as I return to \nthe Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  I have been impressed by the President's complete confidence in Ms. \nSpellings and her ability to serve our Nation and its most valuable \nasset, our children, as our top educator.\n  While Ms. Spellings' credentials and experience are very impressive, \nnone is greater than her role as a mother and primary educator of her \ntwo daughters, Mary and Grace. Without a doubt, the home is the \ngreatest classroom.\n  We are all aware of Ms. Spellings' background of service in Texas as \nchief education advisor to then-Governor George W. Bush. I have been \npleased to work with Ms. Spellings during the past four years in her \ncapacity as the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy. Since \nthe announcement of her nomination by President Bush, I have received \nnumerous letters in support of Ms. Spellings by various groups and \nindividuals concerned about education issues.\n  Education is the hallmark of domestic issues. While I believe our \nNation's education system ranks among the finest in the world, we can \nstill make improvements. Funding for schools is vital, and I have \nconsistently supported federal funding to assist our Nation's teachers, \nschools, and students. I will continue to support programs to enrich \nand improve our school system.\n  Ms. Spellings has indicated her strong commitment to the No Child \nLeft Behind Act, NCLB, signed into law by President Bush on January 8, \n2002. I have been supportive of NCLB. Even those who don't agree with \neverything in NCLB agree that they are now focused on making sure every \nchild is progressing, and they are using innovative approaches to \ntracking student achievement and motivating them to meet the new \nstandards.\n  For example, an inner-city school in Utah with a large number of \nstudents in low-income, non-English-speaking families is using funds \nfrom NCLB to purchase a student tracking database that shows how each \nchild is doing in each subject with every teacher. They know who needs \nthe extra help and in what areas. They are enlisting the support of \nparents, teachers, and the community to make sure that these kids get \nthe help they need. And they are having great results. Test scores are \nup. Honor roll is up. Parents are more satisfied. Students are taking \npride in their education. And, that's what NCLB is all about.\n  Of course, this does not mean the law is perfect. We need to fund it \nbetter, and too many schools do not make Annual Yearly Progress or AYP \nbecause they just do not understand what is required, or misinterpreted \nthe law. I think it is going to take some time to adjust. We need to \ncontinue to do what is working in NCLB and look at what is not.\n  Utah has been in the forefront of the debate and was one of the first \nStates to make moves toward possibly opting out of No Child Left \nBehind, due in part to concerns about retaining State control and \nobjections to federal mandates without sufficient funding.\n  Make no mistake, I am a strong advocate for local control of \neducation and want to make sure that there is sufficient flexibility \nfor our States. I trust that the Department of Education will keep open \nlines of communication with the States and localities as we work \ntogether to ensure that truly no child is left behind.\n  I was particularly pleased that during her hearing before the Senate \nHELP Committee, Ms. Spellings accepted my invitation to personally \nvisit Utah to meet with legislators and educators there. We look \nforward to her visit.\n  With her confirmation, Ms. Spellings will replace Secretary Roderick \nPaige. I would like to take a moment to note outgoing Secretary \nRoderick Paige's service. During his tenure, he led the implementation \nof major education reforms. He showed great commitment to providing our \nchildren a quality education, notwithstanding their circumstances, \nthereby honoring the pledge to leave no child behind. While so doing, \nSecretary Paige demonstrated willingness to consider certain \nadjustments in an effort to align the implementation of the No Child \nLeft Behind Act with the intent of the law. We thank him for his \nservice.\n  Without a doubt, Ms. Spellings has many challenges ahead, but I am \nconfident that she will serve our country with dedication and \ndistinction.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/24/senate-section/article/S139-1", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S139-S140]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           IN HONOR OF DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.'S BIRTHDAY\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask that this statement be inserted \nin the proper place in the Record.\n  I rise today to honor the life and legacy of Reverend Dr. Martin \nLuther King, Jr.\n  While I participated in an event commemorating the life of Dr. King \nat the Morning Star Community Tabernacle Church in Linden, New Jersey, \nI felt it was important to pay tribute to the life and legacy of this \nextraordinary American on the first legislative day of this 109th \nCongress.\n  The impact of Dr. King's life, actions and deeds is just as great \ntoday as it was 36 years ago, when his life was taken from us. Dr. King \naccomplished so much in his short life; he was a pastor, civil rights \nactivist and leader, Nobel Peace Prize recipient, Time magazine's Man \nof the Year, and in many ways, the emancipator of all Americans.\n  Dr. King's adherence to nonviolence in the pursuit of social justice \nleft an indelible mark on our nation's history and conscience. Clearly, \nmuch progress has been made in the struggle for civil rights, equality \nand social justice. We rightly pay tribute to the civil rights \naccomplishments to date, and we rightly attribute much of that progress \nto Dr. King.\n  But there is still much to do. And sadly, the current administration \nhas had a disappointing record on civil rights and has shown little \ninterest in shouldering leadership responsibility on these important \nissues.\n  Two years ago, on the week before we celebrated the birthday of Dr. \nKing, Jr., President Bush intervened in a case before the United States \nSupreme Court in an effort to destroy affirmative action, which is \neffectively ``equal education rights'' for African Americans and other \nminority groups.\n  The case involved the University of Michigan program which used race \nas one factor among many when selecting incoming students. I joined \nother United States Senators in an amicus brief in support of the \nUniversity of Michigan affirmative action program. Thankfully, in its \nfirst ruling on affirmative action in higher education admissions in 25 \nyears, the nation's highest court ruled on June 23, 2003, that race can \nbe used in university admission decisions. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor \nwas the eventual deciding vote in the case, saying that affirmative \naction is still needed in America--but hoped that its days are \nnumbered.\n  Last year, on Dr. King's 75th birthday, President Bush went to \nAtlanta and laid a wreath at Dr. King's grave. The very next day, \ndespite protest from the civil rights community and against the \nexpressed will of the Senate, President Bush recess appointed Judge \nCharles Pickering to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  President Bush cast aside several significant concerns of the African \nAmerican and civil rights community. Some of these concerns included: \nJudge Pickering's support as a State Senator in the 1960s for the \nMississippi Sovereignty Commission, which was established to prevent \nthe implementation of Brown v. Board of Education; Judge Pickering's \nopposition as a legislator and Federal judge to voting rights for \nAfrican Americans; and Judge Pickering's disturbing positions as a \nFederal judge on two of the key protections of equal voting rights for \nall Americans--the one person-one vote\n\n[[Page S140]]\n\nConstitutional doctrine and the Voting Rights Act.\n  These are just two examples of a broader indifference President Bush \nhas shown to the social, economic, and legal obstacles African-\nAmericans are forced to overcome in their ongoing effort to achieve \nreal equality.\n  Affirmative action has proven beneficial in combating past \ndiscrimination and it remains necessary today. Judge Pickering is just \none of a host of judicial nominees opposing civil rights President Bush \nhas put forth as part of a larger effort to pack the Federal courts \nwith ultra-conservative ideologues.\n  Each of us must do our part to advance the legacy of Dr. Martin \nLuther King, Jr., and to promote civil rights equality. I will continue \nto provide leadership in the 109th Congress to help minority \nbusinesses, increase access to education and health care, improve job \ngrowth, and fight racial profiling.\n  I hope that President Bush and the entire Congress will do the same.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/24/senate-section/article/S140-1", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S140]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO STEVE BEASLEY\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President. I rise today to say a few words of thanks \nto Steve Beasley, an outstanding agriculture economist at USDA who \nrecently completed a year-long fellowship on the Senate Finance \nCommittee. Steve's service to the committee, and by extension to the \nState of Montana, will be remembered fondly and with great \nappreciation.\n  A year ago I was able to snag Steve away from his job at the Foreign \nAgriculture Service at the Department of Agriculture. He brought to us \nyears of experience in foreign market development and capacity-\nbuilding. During his time with the committee, his expertise proved \ninvaluable as he worked on calculating the effects of the North \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement on Montana agricultural products, \nanalyzing the effect of agricultural trade liberalization on crop \nprices over the past few years, as well as helping prepare me for trade \nmissions to Australia, New Zealand, China, Japan, and Thailand.\n  Half of my State's economy is based on agriculture, and the work \nSteve did for us will serve us for the next several years as we examine \nthe effects of trade on our economy's largest sector. I am sad to see \nhim go, but I know the USDA is eager to get him back. I thank him for \nhis hard work over this past year, and I wish him all the luck in the \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/24/senate-section/article/S140-2", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S140]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO MR.

Mr. President, Senator Baucus and I are honored today to \npay tribute to Paul Kasten and thank him for the exceptional service \nand commitment he has given to the people of Montana. Mr. Kasten served \nfaithfully with the U.S. Postal Service, particularly to Montanans \nalong the Brockway, Paris, Watkins, and Flowing Wells rural mail route \nloop. As he celebrates a well-deserved retirement, let it be known that \nhe leaves behind a memorable and strong legacy, spanning 57 years of \ndedicated service to the U.S. Postal Service, his eastern Montana mail \nroute loop, and the people of the State of Montana. We know Congressman \nRehberg sends his support and congratulations as well for Paul's \nsignificant achievement.\n  Beginning with a team of horses, Mr. Kasten delivered the mail \nfaithfully to this frontier mail route for 57 noteworthy years, \nhonorably upholding the U.S. Postal Service's code of conduct. In fact, \nhe has gone above and beyond the call of duty on many occasions, \ndelivering groceries and other necessary items to many people along \nthis remote mail route during his tenure. It is clear that Mr. Paul \nKasten has ceaselessly served the U.S. Postal Service and the State of \nMontana for nearly six decades, and is justly deserving of the honor \ndue to him today. It is with great pride that Senator Baucus and I \nbring to the attention of this great body the hard work that Mr. Kasten \nhas completed, both to the State of Montana and to Montana's people. \nThank you for all your commendable service, Paul, and we wish you and \nyour family all the best in your future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/24/senate-section/article/S140-3", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S140]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         HONORING DENNIS WIESE\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to publicly commend \nthe work of Mr. Dennis Wiese, President of South Dakota Farmers Union, \nSDFU, for his 12 years of dedicated service to South Dakota's farmers, \nranchers and rural people. After six and a half terms as President of \nSDFU, Dennis has decided not to seek reelection and will begin his own \nconsulting business in his hometown of Flandreau, SD.\n  Over the years, Dennis has been extraordinarily committed to South \nDakota agriculture and is a real ambassador for farming and ranching in \nthe state. As chair of the National Farmers Union subcommittee that \nworked on the farm bill rural development section, Dennis' insight was \ninvaluable, during negotiations on the Farm Security and Rural \nInvestment Act of 2002.\n  Since its establishment in 1914, South Dakota Farmers Union has \nconsistently been a voice for family farmers and ranchers, always \nstriving to improve the business climate for agriculture and the \nquality of life for all South Dakotans. Now, 91 years later, SDFU is \nregarded as the leader on issues concerning concentration in the agri-\nbusiness sector. I have always been able to rely on Dennis and the SDFU \nfor the backing needed to stand up for the family agricultural \nproducers and the special position they hold America's business and \ncultural structure. Always looking to improve the quality of rural \nliving, Dennis has been a consistent champion for fair trade, even when \nthe notion has been unpopular to some. Throughout his presidency, \nDennis faced some difficult situations. However, he never lost focus on \nthe concerns that are important to South Dakotan's and continued to \nwork for the betterment of rural America.\n  Under Dennis' leadership, SDFU has enhanced the lives of thousands of \nSouth Dakotans through various educational programs, particularly those \naimed at the younger generation of farmers. Involvement in the SDFU \neducation program jumped from 389 young producers enrolled in camps in \n1997, to over 1,200 participants in the most recent camps. These camps \nteach young people about the benefits of cooperatives and shared \nresponsibility, as well as the important rural values that make South \nDakota stronger. As Dennis noted in his farewell speech to SDFU:\n\n       The most important Farmers Union is not the Farmers Union \n     of yesterday. It is not the Farmers Union that I inherited \n     from Dallas Tonsager, or the one we enjoy today. The most \n     important Farmers Union is the one we turn over to the next \n     generation of Farmers Union leaders. The most important \n     Farmers Union is the Farmers Union of tomorrow.\n\n  Dennis' hard work as president is reflected in the impressive legacy \nhe leaves behind. SDFU has a strong, expanding membership, and \nprosperous and thriving education program filled with innovative ideas \nto revitalize South Dakota's rural communities.\n  It is with great honor that I share Dennis' accomplishments with my \ncolleagues and publicly commend him for excellently serving South \nDakota and family farmers. I wish the very best for him, his wife \nJulie, and his children Dayton, Kyle, Owen, Austin and Elysa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/24/senate-section/article/S140-4", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S140-S141]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HONORING DR. VINE DELORIA, JR.\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, it is with great honor that I \npublicly commend Dr. Vine Deloria, Jr., for receiving the American \nIndian Visionary Award.\n  Dr. Deloria, a member of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, is a \ndistinguished Native American scholar whose research, writings, and \nteaching span history, law, religion, and politics. This award, given \nby the Native American publication, Indian Country Today, honors those \nwho display ``the highest qualities and attributes of leadership in \ndefending the foundations of American Indian freedom.'' This is an \nhonor Dr. Deloria richly deserves.\n  Born in 1933 in Martin, SD., Dr. Deloria has been at the forefront of \nAmerican Indian activism since the 1960s. As executive director of the \nNational Congress of American Indians from 1964 to 1967, Dr. Deloria \nfrequently worked with leaders whose experience dated back to the \nIndian Reorganization Act of 1934. Consequently, Dr. Deloria attributes \nhis involvement\n\n[[Page S141]]\n\nin the Indian movement to working with those influential people, as \nthey encouraged a new breed of activists.\n  For the past 4 decades, Dr. Deloria has been a voice of influence in \nIndian history, writing more than twenty books and countless articles \nand lectures. His works stimulated political thinking and discourse \namong Indian activists. As Wilma Mankiller, former Principal Chief of \nthe Cherokee Nation, said of Dr. Deloria, ``No writer has more clearly \narticulated the unspoken emotions, dreams and lifeways of contemporary \nNative people.''\n  Now a retired professor of political science from the University of \nArizona and retired professor emeritus from the University of Colorado, \nDr. Deloria is still writing and inspiring young activists from his \nhome in Tucson, Arizona. In fact, Time magazine recognized Deloria as \none of the 11 most influential religious thinkers of the twentieth \ncentury. As Indian Country Today notes, ``Vine Deloria Jr. provided \nenormous perception, guidance, strategy and sheer analytical heft to \nthe struggle for respect and justice for American Indians.''\n  Dr. Vine Deloria, Jr., is an extraordinary pioneer and supporter of \nNative American rights and the honor of winning the American Indian \nVisionary Award is one he highly deserves. He is a man of great \nscholarship and knowledge, and will continue to shape history for years \nto come. Dr. Deloria has never sought honors or recognition, but his \nscholarship has brought him well-deserved accolades. It is an honor for \nme to share his accomplishments with my colleagues and to publicly \ncommend Dr. Deloria on his talent and commitment to history, \nunderstanding, and education.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/24/senate-section/article/S141-1", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S141]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO DR. DAVID A. AUSTIN\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that I \nrise today to pay tribute to Dr. David A. Austin, an extraordinary man \nwho touched many lives but passed away on November 4, 2004.\n  Dr. Austin lived a life full of vitality and enthusiasm. He had an \naccomplished career, always helped others without thought for himself \nand made his family the center of his life.\n  Dr. Austin was born in Brattleboro, VT, where he graduated from St. \nMichael's High School and received his Bachelor of Science from St. \nMichael's College. From there he went on to medical school at the \nUniversity of Vermont where he began his lifelong career of healing and \nhelping others.\n  After receiving his Naval Medical Officer commission, he continued \nhis education, graduating from the Naval Deep Sea Diving School here in \nWashington, DC and the School of Submarine and Undersea Medicine in New \nLondon, CT.\n  After completing his active duty and residency at St. Albans Naval \nHospital in New York, Dr. Austin opened his medical practice in Rutland \nin 1970. When not practicing medicine, he was busy serving the \ncommunity as a member of the Christ the King Elementary School Parent-\nTeacher Association and the Mount St. Joseph Academy school board, on \nboth of which he served as president for a time.\n  Later in life, when many people his age were settling into \nretirement, he was called up during the first Gulf War to Bahrain to \nserve his country once again, after which he was awarded the \nPresidential Meritorious Service Medal.\n  But one of his greatest honors came last April when his peers in the \nmedical community awarded him the Physician of the Year Award. A better \nman could not have been recognized.\n  Dr. Austin will be missed by family, friends and all those he touched \nwith his healing hand.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/24/senate-section/article/S141-2", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S141]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   TRIBUTE TO ADAM GARDNER, YILEI YANG, ASHLEY SMITH, JACK HARTZ AND \n                             BENJAMIN GOWAN\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to Adam \nGardner, Yilei Yang, Ashley Smith, Jack Hartz and Benjamin Gowan as \nfive truly outstanding students from the Commonwealth of Kentucky.\n  The National Honor Society organizes a Scholar's Bowl to foster a \nspirit of aspiration and hard work in America's students. These Scholar \nBowls include testing of each student in five different categories: \nEnglish, math, science, social studies, and general knowledge. The \ntests are rigorous and they require a longstanding history as a good \nstudent.\n  Being recognized by this organization is truly an honor and I am \npleased to hear that these five students from Kentucky have become the \nNational Honor Society's Scholar Bowl Champions. The four students from \nduPont Manual High School in Louisville, KY successfully defended their \nschool's title as National Honor Society National Scholar's Bowl \nChampions.

Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Stabenow and \nmyself, I congratulate the William Beaumont Hospital on 50 years of \ndedicated service to the Michigan community.\n  William Beaumont Hospital opened its doors in Royal Oak in 1955 as a \nresult of a survey in southeast Michigan which showed an overwhelming \nneed for medical assistance in the area. The survey was quickly proven \ncorrect. Within its first week of operation, the hospital performed \nover 40 major surgeries and delivered over 30 babies. As the need \ncontinued to grow, Beaumont opened a second hospital in 1977 in Troy.\n  In the past 50 years, Beaumont has grown significantly, logging \nnearly 1.7 million inpatient admissions and nearly 3.3 million \nemergency visits. It works closely with several universities in \nMichigan to provide premier residency and fellowship programs and the \nBeaumont Research Institute conducts more than 800 active studies \nfunded by grants.\n  Today, Beaumont is ranked among the top hospitals not just in \nMichigan but in the Nation. With staff representing over 90 different \nmedical and surgical specialties, Beaumont has been honored with \nnumerous awards including AARP's ``Top 50 Hospitals,'' one of \n``America's Best Hospitals'' by U.S. News and World Report, a ``100 Top \nHospitals--National Benchmarks for Success'' by Solucient, and one of \nMichigan's ``Best Places to Work'' by Crain's Detroit Business.\n  Senator Stabenow and I are delighted to have the opportunity to thank \nthe former and current staff of Beaumont Hospital for their enormous \ncontributions to the State of Michigan and to congratulate them on \nreaching this significant milestone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/24/senate-section/article/S141-4", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S141]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/24/senate-section/article/S141-5", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S141]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/24/senate-section/article/S141-6", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S141-S142]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXECUTIVE REPORT OF COMMITTEE\n\n  The following executive report of committee was submitted:\n\n       By Mr. CRAIG for the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n       * Jim Nicholson, of Colorado, to be Secretary of Veterans \n     Affairs.\n\n  * Nomination was reported with recommendation that it be confirmed \nsubject to the nominee's commitment to\n\n[[Page S142]]\n\nrespond to requests to appear and testify before any duly constituted \ncommittee of the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/24/senate-section/article/S142-1", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S142-S145]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second times by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Mr. GREGG (for himself, Mr. Frist, Mr. Sessions, Mr. \n             DeWine, Mr. Allen, Mr. Santorum, Mr. McConnell, and \n             Mr. DeMint):\n       S. 3.

A bill to strengthen and protect America in the war on terror; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, as reports continue to appear in the media, \nthere can be little doubt that a critical area of homeland security, \nand one on which I will be focusing as Chairman of the Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pensions Committee, is the issue of bioterrorism. \nIt is clear that we cannot separate the need for a strong national \nbiodefense from other aspects of emergency preparedness.\n  Last summer, when President Bush signed the Project Bioshield Act \ninto law, he called bioterrorism and efforts to use modern technologies \nagainst us the greatest danger of our time. The threat posed by \nbioterror has not gone unnoticed by terrorists and those who wish to do \nus harm. That is why we must continue to do everything we can to ensure \nour ability to respond to the use of biological weapons.\n  In the months to come, my Committee will be working together to \ndevelop the strategy we will need to provide for a strong national \nbiodefense. We will be exploring a number of options in that effort, \nlike providing incentives to increase private sector participation in \nthe development of bioterror countermeasures and biopreparedness tools. \nWe will also be examining ways to strengthen our domestic vaccine \nindustry and increase the overall readiness of our public health \nsystem.\n  While I commend its intent, I declined to cosponsor S. 3, the \nRepublican leadership bioterrorism bill introduced today. I look \nforward to developing bipartisan legislation to strengthen our national \nbiodefense system in our Committee. Senator Burr, who will be heading \nthe Subcommittee on Bioterrorism and Public Health Preparedness, will \nbe an important part of that effort. I am also looking forward to the \ninput of my fellow Committee members, including Senators Kennedy, Gregg \nand Hatch, as well as Senator Lieberman, who, while not a member of my \nCommittee, has made this a priority of his work in the Congress and put \na great deal of thought and effort into the area. In the coming weeks \nand months, I will also be convening a number of discussions with \ncritical stakeholders and experts as we develop our legislation.\n  Together, I am confident we can build on the work Congress and \nPresident Bush began with the Project Bioshield legislation and do what \nis necessary to ensure that we are as prepared as we possibly can be \nfor the ever-present and constantly changing threat of bioterrorism.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ENZI (for himself, Mr. Frist, and Mr. McConnell):\n  S. 9. A bill to improve American competitiveness in the global \neconomy by improving and strengthening Federal education and training \nprograms, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, last week we had an opportunity to be a part \nof a truly historic event. As we gathered together on the west front of \nthe Capitol, a huge crowd joined us along the Mall and down \nPennsylvania Avenue to witness the inauguration of President Bush. It \nwas a great moment for America as the President took his oath of \noffice. Later, in what was one of the best inaugural speeches I have \never heard, he outlined his vision for the future and the theme for his \nsecond term.\n  It filled my heart with pride to hear him speak about freedom and the \nrole America would continue to play in helping to bring its bright \nlight to bear on the darkest regions of the world. As he spoke, I was \npleased to hear him also renew, his commitment to our Nation's \neducation system and to bringing the highest standards to our schools. \nThe President made it clear that such an effort was an important part \nof making sure that every American has a stake in our future as a \nnation. Without it, the American dream we have shared for many years \nmay be reduced to a nightmare for future generations.\n  Clearly, we can't allow that to happen. That is why I am pleased to \njoin, with the distinguished majority leader, Dr. Frist, and my friend \nand colleague, from Tennessee, Senator Alexander, in introducing \nlegislation we have written to address that need and ensure a brighter \nfuture for our children. Among the goals our legislation seeks to \naddress is the importance of strengthening our public education system, \nensuring parents are involved in the process and, above all, giving our \nteachers the support they need to obtain the results we must have if \nour children are to have the best chance to succeed in life.\n  The legislation I am introducing today continues the work we began \nwith the passage of the No Child Left Behind Act. That bipartisan \nlegislation made it clear that we had high expectations for all public \nschool children. It made making sure those expectations were met the \ncenter of our Federal education policy. That policy has had good \nresults. Children all over the country, including minority children, \nare improving their reading skills. Their math scores are getting \nbetter. In another 2 years, when science is included in the State \nassessments, I believe we will see that students are doing better in \nthat subject, too. Thanks to the passage of the No Child Left Behind \nAct that we all had a hand in, we are continuing to see more and more \npositive results in our schools.\n  Although our record of success is impressive, there is still room for \nmore improvement. According to the most recent National Assessment of \nEducation Progress, over 25 percent of twelfth grade students could not \nread at grade level. Only two-thirds of students entering the ninth \ngrade are expected to complete high school within 4 years. That is a \ndire forecast for our future, but it need not be so if we stick to the \ngoals we have set and work to achieve them.\n  We want to make sure we continue to set high expectations of what all \nstudents can achieve, regardless of their background. This needs to be \na common theme in all our Federal education programs. All students can \nlearn and every child can be a star pupil. It is not just a slogan. It \nis a philosophy that our teachers need to put into practice every day \nin the classroom. It must then be echoed by every student's parents \neach evening at home at the dinner table.\n  We need to make sure Federal programs emphasize accountability, but \nwe also need to make sure we do it in a way that makes sense. Many \nFederal programs designed to serve the same population of students have \ndifferent requirements. We can help our teachers serve their students \nbetter by reducing the amount of time they spend outside the classroom \non activities that don't help our children learn. Federal program \nrequirements should not work against the, goal we have set of improving \nstudent achievement.\n  It is important to provide flexibility to the States so they can \nmanage Federal program dollars and address their unique needs in the \nmost effective manner possible. We need to let leaders at the State and \nlocal level make the important decisions about this country's \neducation, because they are at the level closest to the people--and \nclosest to the classroom where we must continue to get good results \nfrom our efforts.\n  The needs of rural schools must also continue to be addressed. \nSchools in rural States like Wyoming have unique needs and serve \nsmaller populations. They can't be administered like the large schools \nof the big cities in the East. One-size-fits-all policies that may work \nin large population centers are all too often doomed to fail in the \nsmaller towns and cities of the West.\n  Although funding will be a key in the effort to address these issues, \nthe Federal Government provides only a fraction of education spending \nin this country. For K-12 education, the Federal investment is still \naround 8 percent. The rest of the money comes from States and local \ndistricts. We need to trust these educators and administrators to work \non behalf of the children in their charge. We must ensure they have the \ntools they need to serve their students and help all children in their \narea succeed.\n  We also want to support lifelong learning opportunities for students \nat every stage in their life. Education is\n\n[[Page S147]]\n\nchanging; the way we approach learning has to change as well. Federal \nprograms should reflect these changes and help our students adapt to \nthem. Las year, more than 70 percent of college students were \nconsidered ``nontraditional.'' Our education system needs to address \nthe needs of adult learners, as well as children who take the more \n``traditional'' track in education.\n  We want to create a strong link between education and the workforce. \nBusinesses are creating and filling good jobs with good candidates, and \nwe want to make sure we are filling those jobs with American workers.\n  In our technology-driven economy, school can never be out. It is \nestimated that 60 percent of tomorrow's jobs will require skills that \nonly 20 percent of today's workers possess. It is also estimated that \nthe average worker leaving college today will switch careers 14 times \nin their life, and 10 of those careers haven't been invented yet.\n  To address those needs, we need a system in place that can support a \nlifetime of education, training, and retraining. As tomorrow's workers \nchange careers, they will need to learn new skills, or to apply their \ncurrent skills in new ways. Our postsecondary institutions will play a \ncritical role in supporting these students, as they do now through a \nnumber of Federal education programs.\n  High school dropouts are the most at-risk school population in the \nworkforce. We must look at Federal efforts to reform high schools to \nmake sure we are keeping students in school. We need to make sure that \nstudents are leaving high school with a diploma, a quality education, \nand the strong foundation of reading, writing, math and science skills \nthat will help them succeed in the workforce. We must also reach out to \nthose who do not have high school diplomas to give them an opportunity \nto increase the level of their skills so that they, too, have a chance \nto succeed in life. We can do that by increasing their awareness of and \ninvolvement in lifetime of learning programs.\n  In this bill, we have also included language to reauthorize the \nWorkforce Investment Act. That will help an estimated 900,000 \nunemployed workers each year get back to work and provide American \nworkers with the skills they will need to be competitive in the global \nmarketplace. That will help them land the good jobs that will be \ncreated in the years to come. Our legislation will also support the \nneeds of businesses including small businesses looking for skilled \nworkers. In addition, the bill will strengthen the role of public \neducation institutions in the Federal workforce preparation effort, \nincluding our community colleges.\n  As we work on this and other education legislation, we must ensure we \nare focused on getting the results that will help our children succeed \nin life. We can do that by incorporating high expectations, \naccountability, flexibility for our States in administering Federal \nassistance, and a lifetime of learning opportunities, into our \neducation policies. If we do that, every child's life will be a success \nstory and everyone will have the freedom to live their own version of \nthe American dream.\n  As we continue to work on improving our Nation's education system, an \neducated citizenry will continue to be our goal. It will never be \nenough to provide our children with a diploma. We must provide them \nwith the skills they will need to compete for and win the jobs of \ntomorrow and keep them.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEVIN (for himself, Mr. Reid, Ms. Mikulski, Ms. Stabenow, \n        Mr. Inouye, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Salazar, \n        Mr. Rockefeller, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Bingaman, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. \n        Durbin, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Pryor, Mr. Nelson of \n        Nebraska, Mr. Reed, Mr. Schumer, and Mr. Dayton):\n  S. 11. A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to ensure that \nthe strength of the Armed Forces and the protections and benefits for \nmembers of the Armed Forces and their families are adequate for keeping \nthe commitment of the people of the United States to support their \nservice members, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am honored to introduce the Standing with \nOur Troops Act of 2005. This bill addresses the needs of the Soldiers, \nSailors, Airmen, and Marines who have responded so bravely to the call \nof our Nation. We owe it to them and their families to ensure that they \nare properly trained and equipped for the hazardous duties they are \nperforming, that they are fairly compensated for their service, and \nthat they receive their pay in the correct amount, on time.\n  We start with the recognition that we have cut our troop strength too \nfar to sustain current military operations. This bill would authorize \nincreases of up to 40,000 additional active duty Soldiers and Marines \nover the next two years. The bill authorizes an increase in the active \nduty Army end strength by up to 20,000 Soldiers in 2006 and an \nadditional 10,000 in 2007, and it authorizes an increase in the Marine \nCorps' active duty end strength by up to 5,000 Marines in 2006 and an \nadditional 5,000 Marines in 2007.\n  The Department of Defense currently reports numbers of service \nmembers killed or seriously wounded in action in our ongoing combat \noperations in Iraq and Afghanistan. This bill would require a formal \nmonthly report that includes the numbers of Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen \nand Marines who are killed in action; killed as a result of non-combat \ninjuries incurred during combat operations; killed as a result of self-\ninflicted wounds or suicide; wounded in action, when the injuries \nprevent the service member from returning to duty within 72 hours; \nwounded in action when the service member returns to duty within 72 \nhours, insofar as this data is currently maintained; and the total \nnumber of service personnel evacuated from theater for medical reasons.\n  To ensure that awards and decorations are expeditiously and fairly \nawarded to deserving military personnel, this bill would establish an \nAdvisory Panel on Military Awards and Decorations to review the \npolicies and practices of each of the Services for awarding medals and \ndecorations and to report to Congress. This Panel would compare the \ndifferent Service policies and practices for decorating its military \npersonnel, and make a recommendation as to whether individual service \npractices should be continued or a single standard adopted that applies \nto all Services; recommend measures that can be taken to ensure that \nservice members serving in combat are at least as likely to receive \nmedals as those not exposed to combat, and enlisted personnel are just \nas likely as officers to be decorated for their service.\n  This bill would create an Office of Mobilization Planning and \nPreparedness within the National Security Council to ensure that all of \nour national resources are assembled and organized to respond to a \nnational security emergency. National resources include our military, \nlabor, transportation, industry and financial resources.\n  We know that current military operations are wearing out military \nequipment faster than we are replacing it. To address this, this bill \nwould require the Secretary of Defense to report to Congress on the \nneeds of our military forces for reconstituting stocks of equipment and \nmaterial damaged, destroyed, and worn out in Operation Iraqi Freedom \nand Operation Enduring Freedom. The report will include the needs of \neach military service, including the reserve components, for repair and \nreplacement of equipment; and authorize appropriation of $8.5 billion \nfor the Army and $2.1 billion for the Marine Corps for repair, \nrefurbishment, and replacement of equipment used in OIF and OEF.\n  The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found, and I agree, that \nthe Department of Defense's mobilization and deployment policies were \nimplemented in a piecemeal fashion not linked to a strategic framework. \nWe owe it to our service men and women to have clear policies regarding \nlengths of deployments. The Department of Defense must clearly \ncommunicate these policies and other deployment related information to \nservice members and their families. This bill would require the \nSecretary of Defense to report to Congress on DoD policies on lengths \nof mobilization and deployment periods and on the use of stop-loss to \nkeep military personnel in the service beyond their service \ncommitments.\n\n[[Page S148]]\n\n  In two separate reports, the GAO has found that more than 90 percent \nmobilized reserve component personnel experienced pay problems. The GAO \nfound that ``These pay problems often had a profound adverse impact on \nindividual soldiers and their families.'' This bill would require the \ndesignation of a senior official to ensure implementation of GAO \nrecommendations to correct these pay problems.\n  Representation of our reserve component personnel at the highest \nlevels in the Department of Defense has not kept pace with the \nincreased role of our Guard and Reserve personnel. Accordingly, this \nbill creates a new position, a Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for \nReserve Affairs, to speak for the Reserve Components.\n  This bill would give tax relief to mobilized service members and \nemployers who make up for pay lost to service members who are ordered \nto active duty. It would amend the Internal Revenue Code to authorize \nactivated National Guard and Reserve personnel to make penalty free \nwithdrawals from qualified retirement plans; allow employers a tax \ndeduction for making up the difference between military pay and \ncivilian income of mobilized reservists; and authorize a tax credit to \nsmall business employers who continue to compensate members of the \nReady Reserve ordered to active duty and for costs of hiring a \nreplacement employee.\n  We know that the military pay of about a third of our mobilized \nNational Guard and Reserve personnel is less than the pay they received \nfrom their civilian jobs. Many private employers already pay a wage \ndifferential to those who lose money, and we will encourage more to do \nso with the tax incentives I have just described. The biggest employer \nof our Guard and Reserve personnel is the Federal Government, and the \nFederal Government should do as much as the private employers do for \nthose who lose money while serving our Nation. This bill would require \nFederal Agencies to make up the pay differences for Federal employees \nwho are ordered to active duty.\n  Studies have shown that 40 percent of our junior enlisted members in \nthe reserve components have no health insurance except when they are on \nactive duty. This bill would provide access to the military's TRICARE \nhealth care program for all members of the Selected Reserve and their \nfamilies. They would pay a subsidized premium similar to the premium \ncharged Federal Employees for health care. This will help to ensure \nthat members of the National Guard and Reserves are medically ready \nwhen called to serve in the military.\n  When a Soldier, Sailor, Airmen or Marine dies on active duty, his \nsurvivors currently receive a death gratuity of just over $12,000. This \nis simply not enough. This bill would raise the death gratuity to \n$100,000, and would allow survivors to receive Dependency and Indemnity \nCompensation from the VA as well as a Survivor Benefit Plan annuity \nfrom the Department of Defense.\n  United States taxpayers have borne a disproportionate share of the \ncost for the reconstruction of Iraq. The support of the international \ncommunity for this reconstruction is critical. This bill would require \nthe President to report to Congress on U.S., Iraqi, and foreign \ncontributions to Iraq's reconstruction before any new U.S. \nreconstruction funds are appropriated. The bill would also require any \nU.S. funds for reconstruction in Iraq be in the form of a \ncollateralized loan which the U.S. would guarantee unless the President \nreports to Congress that it is in the U.S. national security interest \nto provide the funds other than in the form of a loan.\n  I again want to compliment the service of the young men and women \nserving in our military forces for their magnificent and unselfish \nservice to our Nation. I trust that the measures included in this bill \nwill serve as a token of the Nation's sincere appreciation for their \ngreat sacrifices and service.\n\n                                 S. 11\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Standing With Our Troops Act \n     of 2005''.\n\n  DIVISION A--FULFILLMENT OF OBLIGATIONS TO THE MEMBERS OF THE ARMED \n                                 FORCES\n\n     TITLE I--STRENGTHS OF THE ARMY AND MARINE CORPS ACTIVE FORCES\n\n     SEC. 101. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) While the United States Armed Forces remain the premier \n     fighting force in the world, the Defense Science Board, in a \n     study carried out in the summer of 2004, found that ``When we \n     match the existing and projected force structure with the \n     current and projected need for stabilization forces we see an \n     enduring shortfall in both total numbers of people and their \n     ability to sustain the continuity of stabilization \n     efforts.''.\n       (2) Between 1989 and 2004, the military personnel end \n     strength of the Army has been reduced by more than 34 \n     percent, and the Department of the Army's civilian workforce \n     has been reduced by more than 45 percent, while the mission \n     rate of the Army has increased by 300 percent.\n       (3) Because of the personnel reductions, the Army National \n     Guard and the Army Reserve are repeatedly being called to \n     active duty to meet Army mission requirements that the \n     active-duty force of the Army is no longer large enough to \n     meet alone. Army National Guard and Army Reserve units have \n     provided up to 40 percent of the military personnel engaged \n     in Operation Iraqi Freedom while they have also been \n     performing a dramatically increased role in homeland defense \n     and continuing to respond to natural disasters, other \n     domestic emergencies, and military contingencies. As a \n     result, the reserve components of the Army have been pushed \n     to the breaking point.\n\n     SEC. 102.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) United States military personnel serving in Operations \n     Iraqi Freedom have experienced significant shortages of \n     critical equipment, such as body armor, aircraft \n     survivability equipment, and armored trucks, including up-\n     armored High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles. In many \n     cases the shortages have lasted several months. For example, \n     the individual body armor needed for protecting every member \n     of the Armed Forces and Department of Defense civilians in \n     Iraq was not produced and fielded until February 2004, 11 \n     months after Operation Iraqi Freedom was launched. Shortages \n     of armor for Army trucks still existed as of the beginning of \n     2005.\n       (2) Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom \n     have taken a substantial toll on military equipment of the \n     Armed Forces. The commanding general of the Army Material \n     Command estimated in 2004 that the Army is wearing out its \n     equipment in Iraq and Afghanistan at a rate that could be up \n     to 10 times faster than the rate at which it wears out its \n     equipment elsewhere during peacetime, and there are no \n     significant reserve stocks of that equipment remaining.\n       (3) It is a solemn obligation of the United States \n     Government to ensure that, whenever the Armed Forces are \n     called into battle, the military personnel fighting or \n     supporting the battle are provided with the safest, most \n     effective technology and equipment.\n\n     SEC. 302.

CONGRESSIONAL DEFENSE COMMITTEES DEFINED.\n\n       In this title, the term ``congressional defense \n     committees'' has the meaning given such term in section \n     101(a)(16) of title 10, United States Code.\n\n         TITLE IV--PERIODS OF OVERSEAS DEPLOYMENTS OF RESERVES\n\n     SEC. 401. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Department of Defense failed to establish an \n     adequate troop deployment and rotation policy for Operation \n     Iraqi Freedom until several months after the operation had \n     begun. For several reserve component units involved in that \n     operation before 2005, the demobilization date was \n     rescheduled three or more times before the unit members were \n     finally allowed to return home.\n       (2) Without an adequate deployment and rotation plan, the \n     Department of Defense has relied on a series of stop-gap \n     measures to retain a sufficient number of troops to carry out \n     the United States missions in Operation Iraqi Freedom and \n     Operation Enduring Freedom, including--\n       (A) institution of a so-called ``stop-loss'' policy that \n     prevents personnel from leaving their units during \n     deployment;\n       (B) extensions of deployments beyond scheduled \n     demobilization dates; and\n       (C) activation of members of the Individual Ready Reserve.\n       (3) In September 2004, the Government Accountability Office \n     reported that ``Many of DOD's policies that affect mobilized \n     reserve component personnel were implemented in a piecemeal \n     manner and were not linked within the context of a strategic \n     framework to meet the organizational goals. . . . Without a \n     strategic framework, OSD and the services made several \n     changes to their personnel policies to increase the \n     availability of the reserve components for the longer-term \n     requirements of the Global War on Terrorism, and \n     predictability declined for reserve component members.''.\n       (4) Fairness to the men and women of the Armed Forces \n     deployed overseas requires that the Department of Defense--\n       (A) have clear policies regarding lengths of deployment \n     periods; and\n       (B) communicate these policies and other deployment-related \n     information to them and their families.\n\n     SEC. 402.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In November 2003, the General Accounting Office \n     reported, in connection with a study conducted by that \n     office, that among Army National Guard soldiers ``450 of the \n     481 soldiers from our 6 case study units had at least 1 pay \n     problem associated with their mobilization. These pay \n     problems severely constrain the Army's and the Department of \n     Defense's (DOD) ability to provide a most basic service to \n     these personnel, many of whom were risking their lives in \n     combat.''.\n       (2) In August 2004, a second study by that office (by then \n     renamed the Government Accountability Office) found that \n     among Army Reserve soldiers ``332 of 348 soldiers (95 \n     percent) we audited at 8 case study units that were \n     mobilized, deployed, and demobilized at some time during the \n     18-month period from August 2002 through January 2004 had at \n     least 1 pay problem.''.\n       (3) The August 2004 report concluded that ``These pay \n     problems often had a profound adverse impact on individual \n     soldiers and their families. For example, soldiers were \n     required to spend considerable time, sometimes while deployed \n     in remote, hostile environments overseas, seeking help on pay \n     inquiries or in correcting errors in their active duty pays, \n     allowances, and related tax benefits.''.\n\n     SEC. 502.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n\n[[Page S152]]\n\n       (1) Since September 11, 2001, the National Guard and the \n     other reserve components of the Armed Forces have experienced \n     an expansion of their role in the total force structure of \n     the Armed Forces to an unprecedented level. In 2004, the \n     reserve components comprised 40 percent of the total force of \n     the Armed Forces. Reservists are experiencing a dramatic \n     increase in operation tempo and average length of deployment.\n       (2) While the extent of the role of the reserve component \n     has changed so dramatically, the Department of Defense \n     approach to management of the reserve components has remained \n     much the same. No new senior leadership positions have been \n     established to manage the reserve components more effectively \n     in the expanded role.\n\n     SEC. 602.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) According to a Government Accountability Office report \n     in November 2004, ``The September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks \n     and the global war on terrorism have triggered the largest \n     activation of National Guard forces since World War II. As of \n     June 2004, over one-half of the National Guard's 457,000 \n     personnel had been activated for overseas warfighting or \n     domestic homeland security missions in Federal and State \n     active duty roles.''. In all, over 400,000 reservists have \n     been mobilized between September 11, 2001, and the beginning \n     of 2005.\n       (2) In March 2003, the General Accounting Office reported \n     that among members of the National Guard and other reserve \n     components of the Armed Forces ``. . . data for past military \n     operations show that 41 percent of drilling unit members \n     reported income loss . . .''. The report further noted that \n     senior officers in the reserve component reported average \n     losses of $5,000 in income upon activation.\n       (3) Not only has operation tempo drastically increased for \n     members of the reserve components, meaning that reservists \n     are being called away from their civilian jobs more often, \n     but also the durations of deployments have increased \n     dramatically as well, meaning that reservists are being \n     called away from their civilian jobs for longer periods. The \n     Government Accountability Office reported in September 2004 \n     that the average annual days of duty performed by members of \n     the reserve components has risen from approximately 40 days \n     in 1989 to approximately 120 days in 2003. A consequence of \n     both increased operations tempo and increased duration of \n     deployment has been a far greater loss of income for \n     reservists answering their country's call to duty.\n\n     SEC. 2102.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) According to the results of a Department of Defense \n     survey conducted in 2000, 20 percent of members of the \n     reserve components of the Armed Forces, including 40 percent \n     of junior enlisted personnel, had no health care coverage \n     while not on active duty.\n       (2) In 2004, Congress passed legislation authorizing \n     reservists to obtain access to the military TRICARE health \n     care program for one year for each 90-day period of active \n     duty service. While the enactment of this law was an \n     important step forward, the law only provides eligibility for \n     health care after active duty has been completed and fails to \n     provide the complete health care coverage necessary to ensure \n     that reservists are medically ready to answer a future call \n     to active duty.\n       (3) In September 2004, the Government Accountability \n     Office, after reviewing pre-deployment health screenings of \n     over 240,000 reservists, reported finding that nearly 7 \n     percent of activated reservists were categorized as \n     nondeployable for health reasons, including nearly 10 percent \n     of the Army Reserve.\n\n     SEC. 2203.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) No amount of money can make up for the loss of a loved \n     one. But the United States can, and is obliged to, honor the \n     service of lost servicemembers by ensuring that their \n     families are financially supported at the time of great need \n     occasioned by those losses.\n       (2) The Federal Government owes families of servicemembers \n     dying on duty a death gratuity that is sufficient to help \n     each family pay for costs associated with the death of the \n     servicemember and to help the members of the family adjust to \n     the financial instability that results from termination of \n     the servicemember's income.\n       (3) Survivors of fallen military personnel who are eligible \n     for both a Survivor Benefit Plan annuity and Dependency and \n     Indemnity Compensation suffer a loss of income as a result of \n     the law that requires a reduction in the Survivor Benefit \n     Plan annuity by the amount of the Dependency and Indemnity \n     Compensation. This unjust prohibition against concurrent \n     receipt of two independent benefits prevents the United \n     States from fulfilling its obligation to the survivors during \n     the time of financial need that is occasioned by the deaths \n     of the fallen servicemembers.\n\n     SEC. 2302.

A bill to combat international terrorism, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the Democratic Leader \nin introducing S. 12, a bill to combat international terrorism.\n  We all know that the primary security threat facing America is from \nterrorists motivated by a radical Islamic fundamentalism. Since the 9/\n11 attacks, we have done much to confront this threat, but we must do \nmuch more. As the 9/11 Commission reported, we are safer, but we are \nnot yet safe. I know that all Senators are committed to the objective \nof making our country safer.\n  We must understand that those who would spread radical Islamic \nfundamentalism and weapons of mass destruction are beyond the reach of \nreason. We must--and we will--defeat them. But hundreds of millions of \nhearts and minds around the world are open to American ideas and \nideals. We must reach them.\n  This bill contains a range of proposals that are designed to \nstrengthen our anti-terrorism efforts in a broad range of areas. It \nwill strengthen our military by expanding our special forces. It will \nstrengthen our intelligence operations by increasing the cadre of the \ntrained linguists in the government. It will strengthen our public \ndiplomacy by increasing funds for State Department programs, \ninternational exchanges, and international broadcasting. It will \nstrengthen our effort to expand basic educational opportunities in the \nMuslim world and combat radical madrassas. It will strengthen our \nassistance to non-governmental organizations working to build \ndemocratic institutions. It will strengthen our programs to help Russia \naccount for, secure and destroy dangerous nuclear materials. And it \nwill strengthen our law enforcement by increasing support for cops on \nthe beat--the people\n\n[[Page S157]]\n\nwho labor on the front lines of homeland security.\n  I cannot take credit for every proposal in this bill. Many of them \nare ideas contributed by my Democratic colleagues. The Democratic \nLeader has graciously allowed me to be the lead sponsor of the bill, \nfor which I am grateful. I look forward to working with all my \ncolleagues to strengthen America's defenses against the threat of \nterrorism--through this and other legislation--in the coming Congress.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 12\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

INCREASED STRENGTH OF ARMY SPECIAL OPERATIONS \n                   FORCES.\n\n       (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the number of the active-duty Army personnel comprising the \n     Army Special Forces Command as of the last day of a fiscal \n     year should be increased as follows:\n       (1) To 4,644, as of September 30, 2006.\n       (2) To 5,144, as of September 30, 2007.\n       (3) To 5,644, as of September 30, 2008.\n       (4) To 6,144, as of September 30, 2009.\n       (b) Increased Active Forces End Strengths To Effectuate \n     Policy on Increase in Strength of Army Special Forces.--\n       (1) Fiscal year 2006.--Effective on October 1, 2005, \n     section 691(b)(1) of title 10, United States Code, is amended \n     by striking ``502,400'' and inserting ``502,900''.\n       (2) Fiscal year 2007.--Effective on October 1, 2006, \n     section 691(b)(1) of such title is amended by striking \n     ``502,900'' and inserting ``503,400''.\n       (3) Fiscal year 2008.--Effective on October 1, 2007, \n     section 691(b)(1) of such title is amended by striking \n     ``503,400'' and inserting ``503,900''.\n       (4) Fiscal year 2009.--Effective on October 1, 2008, \n     section 691(b)(1) of such title is amended by striking \n     ``503,900'' and inserting ``504,400''.\n\n     SEC. 102. FOREIGN LANGUAGE EXPERTISE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Success in the global war on terrorism will require a \n     dramatic increase in institutional and personal expertise in \n     the languages and cultures of the societies where terrorism \n     has taken root, including a substantial increase in the \n     number of national security personnel who obtain expert \n     lingual training.\n       (2) The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the \n     United States identified the countries in the Middle East, \n     South Asia, Southeast Asia, and West Africa as countries that \n     serve or could serve as terrorist havens.\n       (3) Although 22 countries have Arabic as their official \n     language, the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon \n     the United States found that a total of only 6 undergraduate \n     degrees for the study of Arabic were granted by United States \n     colleges and universities in 2002.\n       (4) The report of the National Commission on Terrorist \n     Attacks Upon the United States contained several criticisms \n     of the lack of linguistic expertise in the Central \n     Intelligence Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation \n     prior to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, and called \n     for the Central Intelligence Agency to ``develop a stronger \n     language program, with high standards and sufficient \n     financial incentives''.\n       (5) An audit conducted by the Department of Justice in July \n     2004, revealed that the Federal Bureau of Investigation has a \n     backlog of hundreds of thousands of untranslated audio \n     recordings from terror and espionage investigations.\n       (6) The National Security Education Program Trust Fund, \n     which funds critical grant and scholarship programs for \n     linguistic training in regions critical to national security, \n     will have exhausted all its funding by fiscal year 2006, \n     unless additional appropriations are made to the Trust Fund.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the overwhelming majority of Muslims reject terrorism \n     and a small, radical minority has grossly distorted the \n     teachings of one of the world's great faiths to seek \n     justification for acts of terrorism, such radical Islamic \n     fundamentalism constitutes a primary threat to the national \n     security interests of the United States, and an effective \n     strategy for combating terrorism should include increasing \n     the number of personnel throughout the Federal Government \n     with expertise in languages spoken in predominately Muslim \n     countries and in the culture of such countries;\n       (2) Muslim-Americans constitute an integral and cherished \n     part of the fabric of American society and possess many \n     talents, including linguistic, historic, and cultural \n     expertise that should be harnessed in the war against \n     radical, fundamentalist terror; and\n       (3) amounts appropriated for the National Flagship Language \n     Initiative pursuant to the amendments made by subsection \n     (e)(2) should be used to support the establishment, \n     operation, and improvement of programs for the study of \n     Arabic, Persian, and other Middle Eastern, South Asian, \n     Southeast Asian, and West African languages in institutes of \n     higher education in the United States.\n       (c) Authorization of Appropriations.--\n       (1) National security education trust fund.--Section 810 of \n     the David L. Boren National Security Education Act of 1991 \n     (50 U.S.C. 1910) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n       ``(d) Authorization of Appropriations for the Fund for \n     Fiscal Year 2006.--\n       ``(1) In general.--There are authorized to be appropriated \n     to the Fund $150,000,000 for fiscal year 2006.\n       ``(2) Availability of funds.--Amounts appropriated pursuant \n     to the authorization of appropriations in paragraph (1) shall \n     remain available until expended and not more than $15,000,000 \n     of such amounts may be obligated and expended during any \n     fiscal year.''.\n       (2) National flagship language initiative.--\n       (A) In general.--Section 811(a) of the David L. Boren \n     National Security Education Act of 1991 (50 U.S.C. 1911(a)) \n     is amended by striking ``there is authorized to be \n     appropriated to the Secretary for each fiscal year, beginning \n     with fiscal year 2003, $10,000,000'' and inserting ``there is \n     authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary for each \n     fiscal year 2003 through 2005, $10,000,000, and for each \n     fiscal year after 2005, $20,000,000,''.\n       (B) Availability of funds.--Section 811(b) of such Act (50 \n     U.S.C. 1911(b)) is amended by inserting ``for fiscal years \n     2003 through 2005'' after ``this section''.\n       (3) Demonstration program.--There are authorized to be \n     appropriated to the Director of National Intelligence such \n     sums as may be necessary for each of fiscal years 2006, 2007, \n     and 2008 in order to carry out the demonstration program \n     established under subsection (c).\n\n     SEC. 103. CURTAILING TERRORIST FINANCING.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The report of the National Commission on Terrorist \n     Attacks Upon the United States stated that ``[v]igorous \n     efforts to track terrorist financing must remain front and \n     center in United States counterterrorism efforts''.\n       (2) The report of the Independent Task Force sponsored by \n     the Council on Foreign Relations stated that ``currently \n     existing U. S. and international policies, programs, \n     structures, and organizations will be inadequate to assure \n     sustained results commensurate with the ongoing threat posed \n     to the national security of the United States''.\n       (3) The report of the Independent Task Force contained the \n     conclusion that ``[l]ong-term success will depend critically \n     upon the structure, integration, and focus of the U. S. \n     Government--and any intergovernmental efforts undertaken to \n     address this problem''.\n       (b) Policy.--It is the policy of the United States--\n       (1) to work with the Government of Saudi Arabia to curtail \n     terrorist financing originating from that country using a \n     range of methods, including diplomacy, intelligence, and law \n     enforcement;\n       (2) to ensure effective coordination and sufficient \n     resources for efforts of the agencies and departments of the \n     United States to disrupt terrorist financing by carrying out, \n     through the Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence in \n     the Department of the Treasury, a comprehensive analysis of \n     the budgets and activities of all such agencies and \n     departments that are related to disrupting the financing of \n     terrorist organizations;\n       (3) to provide each agency or department of the United \n     States with the appropriate number of personnel to carry out \n     the activities of such agency or department related to \n     disrupting the financing of terrorist organizations;\n       (4) to centralize the coordination of the efforts of the \n     United States to combat terrorist financing and utilize \n     existing authorities to identify foreign jurisdictions and \n     foreign financial institutions suspected of abetting \n     terrorist financing and take actions to prevent the provision \n     of assistance to terrorists; and\n       (5) to work with other countries to develop and enforce \n     strong domestic terrorist financing laws, and increase \n     funding for bilateral and multilateral programs to enhance \n     training and capacity-building in countries who request \n     assistance.\n       (c) Authorization of Appropriations To Provide Technical \n     Assistance To Prevent Financing of Terrorists.--\n       (1) In general.--There are authorized to be appropriated to \n     the President for the ``Economic Support Fund'' to provide \n     technical assistance under the provisions of chapter 4 of \n     part II of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2346 \n     et seq.) to foreign countries to assist such countries in \n     preventing the financing of terrorist activities--\n       (A) for fiscal year 2006, $300,000,000; and\n       (B) for fiscal years 2007 and 2008, such sums as may be \n     necessary.\n       (2) Availability of funds.--Amounts appropriated pursuant \n     to the authorization of appropriations in this subsection are \n     authorized to remain available until expended.\n       (3) Additional funds.--Amounts authorized to be \n     appropriated under this subsection are in addition to amounts \n     otherwise available for such purposes.\n\n[[Page S158]]\n\n     SEC. 104.

HIRING AND TRAINING OF BORDER SECURITY PERSONNEL.\n\n       (a) Inspectors and Agents.--\n       (1) Increase in inspectors and agents.--During each of \n     fiscal years 2005 through 2008, the Under Secretary shall--\n       (A) increase the number of full-time agents and associated \n     support staff in the Bureau of Immigration and Customs \n     Enforcement of the Department of Homeland Security by the \n     equivalent of at least 100 more than the number of such \n     employees in the Bureau as of the end of the preceding fiscal \n     year; and\n       (B) increase the number of full-time inspectors and \n     associated support staff in the Bureau of Customs and Border \n     Protection by the equivalent of at least 200 more than the \n     number of such employees in the Bureau as of the end of the \n     preceding fiscal year.\n       (2) Waiver of fte limitation.--The Under Secretary is \n     authorized to waive any limitation on the number of full-time \n     equivalent personnel assigned to the Department of Homeland \n     Security to fulfill the requirements of paragraph (1).\n       (b) Training.--The Under Secretary shall provide \n     appropriate training for agents, inspectors, and associated \n     support staff on an ongoing basis to utilize new technologies \n     and to ensure that the proficiency levels of such personnel \n     are acceptable to protect the borders of the United States.\n                     Subtitle C--Seaport Protection\n\n     SEC. 321. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States port system is a vital artery of the \n     economy of the United States. Almost 95 percent of all \n     foreign trade passes through one or more of the 361 ports in \n     the United States. Such seaports handle more than \n     2,000,000,000 tons of domestic and international freight each \n     year of which has a value of more than $740,000,000. The \n     shipment of cargo in vessels creates employment for \n     13,000,000 people within the United States.\n       (2) The United States Coast Guard has estimated that, given \n     this tremendous commerce, a terrorist attack shutting down a \n     major port in the United States would have a $60,000,000 \n     impact on the United States economy during the first 30 days \n     after such an attack.\n       (3) Although 6,000,000 cargo containers, each a possible \n     hiding place for a bomb or other weapon, are off-loaded at \n     ports in the United States each year, less than \\1/10\\ of \n     these containers are physically inspected. A container ship \n     can carry as many as 3,000 containers, each one weighing up \n     to 45,000 pounds, hundreds of which may be off-loaded at a \n     port.\n       (4) The United States Coast Guard has estimated that the \n     maritime security requirements set for ports by the Maritime \n     Transportation Security Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-295; 116 \n     Stat. 2064), which are critical to protecting United States \n     ports from a nuclear terrorist attack, will cost \n     $5,400,000,000 to implement over a 10-year period.\n\n     SEC. 322.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In a report entitled ``Emergency First Responders: \n     Drastically Underfunded, Dangerously Unprepared'', an \n     independent task force sponsored by the Council on Foreign \n     Relations found that ``America's local emergency responders \n     will always be the first to confront a terrorist incident and \n     will play the central role in managing its immediate \n     consequences.

PROHIBITION ON WAR PROFITEERING.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) War profiteering, the overcharging of taxpayers for any \n     good or service with the specific intent to excessively \n     profit from a conflict or reconstruction situation, not only \n     defrauds taxpayers in the United States, but also threatens \n     the safety of United States troops in harms way by hindering \n     reconstruction progress, damaging the credibility of the \n     United States, and wasting resources that could be used for \n     troop protection.\n       (2) Laws prohibiting fraud protect against waste of tax \n     dollars within the United States, but no current fraud \n     statute expressly prohibits waste of tax dollars resulting \n     from war profiteering during conflicts in foreign countries.\n       (3) War profiteers have hindered United States efforts to \n     secure and reconstruct Iraq. In its third quarterly report, \n     the Coalition Provisional Authority Inspector General \n     reported that, as of October 12, 2004, it had received a \n     total of 113 potential criminal cases.\n       (4) In nine separate reports, the Defense Contract Audit \n     Agency, the Coalition Provisional Authority Inspector \n     General, and the Government Accountability Office have found \n     widespread, systematic abuses by the Halliburton Company and \n     its subsidiaries, including instances of overcharging worth \n     tens of millions of dollars, fraudulent accounting practices, \n     and kickbacks. Contracts awarded to Custer Battles, LLC, were \n     suspended by the Department of Defense after it uncovered \n     fraudulent billing practices including the establishment of \n     phantom off-shore corporations. Government investigators have \n     found contract irregularities, including lack of transparency \n     and poor accounting, in contracts awarded to other firms.\n       (b) Prohibition of Profiteering.--\n       (1) Prohibition.--\n       (A) In general.--Chapter 47 of title 18, United States \n     Code, is amended by adding at the end the following new \n     section:\n\n     ``Sec. 1038.

A bill to amend titles 10 and 38, United States Code, to \nexpand and enhance health care, mental health, transition, and \ndisability benefits for veterans, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that would \nmake sweeping changes to the way the Department of Veterans Affairs \n(VA) delivers health care and benefits to our nation's veterans. S. 13 \nwould, among other things, guarantee full funding for VA health care, \nprovide for full concurrent receipt, enhance mental health care \nservices, and ease the transition from military service to civilian \nlife.\n  This bill would mean that the 115,000 veterans who choose to make \nHawaii their home would be assured the services they have earned. The \nnearly 18,000 veterans who avail themselves of VA health care in \nHonolulu, Hawaii,\n\n[[Page S169]]\n\nKauai, and Maui would not have to worry if resources for doctors and \nnurses will materialize next year.\n  And because so many of our reservists and Guardsmen are being \ndeployed for the current wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, this bill will \nhelp ensure they get the care they need upon their return.\n  Every year the President sends forward his budget proposal to \nCongress, and every year we go through the same battles to get VA \nhealth care the money it needs to adequately serve its veteran \npatients. The time has come to approach this process more rationally. \nThis legislation would ensure full funding for VA health care by simply \nchanging the way funds are allocated. To be perfectly clear, this bill \nmerely shifts money already being allocated over to a more reliable \nmechanism.\n  The American Legion, the Disabled American Veterans, and the Veterans \nof Foreign Wars support this approach to fully fund the veterans health \ncare system.\n  These three organizations--representing more than 7 million military \nveterans--rightly believe that veterans have earned the right to VA \nmedical care through their ``extraordinary sacrifices and service to \nthis Nation.''\n  We have seen huge numbers of veterans seeking VA care for the first \ntime. I, for one, believe this is a good thing. Others rationalize that \nas we are at war, we must cut back on VA care. I simply do not \nunderstand this logic. We are at war, and therefore we must do \neverything we can to show our military that VA health care will be \nthere for all veterans who served. To accomplish this goal, we must \nchange the way VA health care is funded.\n  Although we have continued to make progress on eliminating the long-\nstanding injustice that has affected our disabled retired veterans' \nretirement pay, we still have work to do.\n  S. 13 will correct this unfairness by allowing all disabled military \nretirees to collect both their full military retired and VA disability \npay concurrently.\n  Most military retirees who have a service-connected disability are \nnot permitted to collect both their retirement and disability benefits \nconcurrently. Military retired pay is the promised reward for 20 or \nmore years of uniformed service and is based on length of service. VA \ndisability compensation is unrelated to length of service and is \nintended to compensate a veteran for a service-connected loss of \nfunction.\n  In order to continue to recruit and retain quality soldiers, sailors, \nairmen and marines, we must pay attention not only to the present, but \nalso to the future. George Washington said:\n\n       The willingness with which our young people are likely to \n     serve in any war, no matter how justified, shall be directly \n     proportional to how they perceive the Veterans of earlier \n     wars were treated and appreciated by their nation.\n\n  Our disabled military retirees deserve to receive the retirement pay \nthat they earned and be compensated for their service-connected \ndisabilities. Our young people will wear the uniforms of our Armed \nForces only if they believe that their service is appreciated and \ncompensated accordingly.\n  Along those lines, S. 13 also seeks to ensure that veterans and \nreturning service members can receive the mental health care they might \nneed as a result of their service. The legislation requires that VA \nemploy at least one psychiatrist and treatment team at each medical \ncenter that does not currently have one. This legislation would also \nmandate that VA carry out a community outreach program to let Operation \nIraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom veterans know about the \nservices available to them at VA.\n  Why is good VA mental health care so important?\n  Because so often battle wounds do not manifest in physical illness, \nbut in quiet and equally debilitating mental illness. These wounds are \nrevealed as post-traumatic stress disorder with effects that linger and \nsymptoms that can be brought on years after combat.\n  While hypertension and heart disease afflict vast numbers of \nveterans, mental illness is not far behind. It might surprise some of \nmy colleagues to know that cancer and depression affect roughly the \nsame number of veterans. But is VA reaching and treating all veterans \nwho need care? This remains very much an open question.\n  This legislation also seeks to improve access to needed prescription \ndrugs. Many veterans have expressed their desire to bring prescriptions \nfrom their Medicare doctors to VA pharmacies to get them filled. \nCurrent VA policy requires that nearly all veterans see a VA doctor \nbefore such prescriptions are issued. This does not make sense.\n  The Department's inspector general testified that VA could see \nsavings of $1 billion a year if veterans were allowed to bring their \noutside prescriptions, because it would obviate the need for VA to re \ndiagnose patients and then re-issue prescriptions that have already \nbeen written. S. 13 would allow these veterans to get their \nprescriptions filled by VA at prices that are far better than in the \nprivate sector.\n  This legislation also seeks to help veterans with their education. S. \n13 would exclude MGIB benefits from computation as income when \ncalculating campus based aid, such as Perkins loans. This draws the \ndistinction between a benefit that has been earned, and paid for, by \nthe veterans, and other types of income. This allows the individual \napplying for financial aid to subtract $1,200 from the expected family \ncontribution for 1 year. This $1,200 represents the money that the \nindividual paid to participate in the MGIB program.\n  S. 13 also offers an opportunity for enrollment in the MGIB education \nprogram for servicemembers who participated in or were eligible to \nparticipate in the post-Vietnam era educational assistance program, \nknown as VEAP. This bill would create a 1-year window and requires the \nindividual to pay $2,700, which was the VEAP contribution.\n  Last year, Congress extended the period of eligibility for education \nbenefits for survivors of servicemembers who were killed during active \nduty. We would like to further extend this delimiting date for veterans \nand other dependents. The 10-year period of eligibility would not begin \nto toll until they began to use the benefit, rather than when they \nbecame eligible for the benefit.\n  Overall, this is a bill to spur dialogue started on the issues that \nare truly important to our Nation's veterans.\n  We all need to work harder towards the goal of seeing that the \npromises made to the men and women who are serving today are met; that \ntheir sacrifices were not in vain.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 13\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Fulfilling Our Duty to \n     America's Veterans Act of 2005''.\n\n                      TITLE I--HEALTH CARE MATTERS\n\n     SEC. 100. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The three largest veterans advocacy groups, the \n     Disabled American Veterans, the American Legion, and the \n     Veterans of Foreign Wars, have called upon Congress to change \n     veterans funding to a mandatory process, stating, ``We \n     believe it is time to guarantee health care funding for all \n     veterans. We believe health care rationing must end. We \n     believe it is time the promise is kept.''.\n       (2) The May 2003 report of The President's Task Force To \n     Improve Health Care Delivery For Our Nation's Veterans found \n     that ``there is a significant mismatch in VA between demand \n     and available funding--an imbalance that . . . if unresolved, \n     will delay veterans' access to care and could threaten the \n     quality of VA health care.''.\n       (3) Under the current funding process, the VA has \n     experienced billion-dollar shortfalls every year for the past \n     several years, resulting in waiting lists several months long \n     for appointments with physicians, a substantial disability \n     claims backlog, and policies designed to prevent veterans \n     from obtaining the health care they were promised.\n\n                      Subtitle A--Funding Matters\n\n     SEC. 101. FUNDING TO ADDRESS CHANGES IN POPULATION AND \n                   INFLATION.\n\n       (a) In General.--Chapter 17 of title 38, United States \n     Code, is amended by inserting after section 1706 the \n     following new section:\n\n     ``Sec. 1706A. Management of health care: funding to address \n       changes in population and inflation\n\n       ``(a) By the enactment of this section, Congress and the \n     President intend to ensure access to health care for all \n     veterans.

The discretionary amount \n     should be equal to the fiscal year 2005 discretionary funding \n     for such programs, functions, and activities, and should \n     remain unchanged each fiscal year thereafter. The annual \n     level of mandatory amount shall be adjusted according to the \n     formula specified in subsection (c). While this section does \n     not purport to control the outcome of the annual \n     appropriations process, it anticipates cooperation from \n     Congress and the President in sustaining discretionary \n     funding for such programs, functions, and activities in \n     future fiscal years at the level of discretionary funding for \n     such programs, functions, and activities for fiscal year \n     2005.

A motion to \n     postpone, or a motion to proceed to the consideration of \n     other business,\n\n[[Page S171]]\n\n     or a motion to recommit the resolution is not in order. A \n     motion to reconsider the vote by which the resolution is \n     agreed to or disagreed to is not in order.\n       (3) Vote on final passage.--Immediately following the \n     conclusion of the debate on a joint resolution described in \n     subsection (b) and a single quorum call at the conclusion of \n     the debate if requested in accordance with the rules of the \n     appropriate House, the vote on final passage of the \n     resolution shall occur.\n       (4) Appeals from decisions of the chair.--Appeals from the \n     decisions of the Chair relating to the application of the \n     rules of the Senate or the House of Representatives, as the \n     case may be, to the procedure relating to a joint resolution \n     described in subsection (b) shall be decided without debate.\n       (f) Consideration by Other House.--\n       (1) Procedure.--If, before the passage by one House of a \n     joint resolution of that House described in subsection (b), \n     that House receives from the other House a joint resolution \n     described in subsection (b), then the following procedures \n     shall apply:\n       (A) The resolution of the other House shall not be referred \n     to a committee and may not be considered in the House \n     receiving it except in the case of final passage as provided \n     in subparagraph (B)(ii).\n       (B) With respect to a joint resolution described in \n     subsection (b) of the House receiving the resolution--\n       (i) the procedure in that House shall be the same as if no \n     resolution had been received from the other House; but\n       (ii) the vote on final passage shall be on the resolution \n     of the other House.\n       (2) Disposition.--Upon disposition of the resolution \n     received from the other House, it shall no longer be in order \n     to consider the resolution that originated in the receiving \n     House.\n       (g) Rules of Senate and House.--This section is enacted by \n     Congress--\n       (1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate \n     and House of Representatives, respectively, and as such it is \n     deemed a part of the rules of each House, respectively, but \n     applicable only with respect to the procedure to be followed \n     in that House in the case of a joint resolution described in \n     subsection (b), and it supersedes other rules only to the \n     extent that it is inconsistent with such rules; and\n       (2) with full recognition of the constitutional right of \n     either House to change the rules (so far as relating to the \n     procedure of that House) at any time, in the same manner, and \n     to the same extent as in the case of any other rule of that \n     House.\n\n                   Subtitle B--Mental Health Matters\n\n     SEC. 111.

ARMED FORCES REVIEW OF MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMS.\n\n       (a) Review of Mental Health Programs.--The Secretary of \n     each military department shall conduct a comprehensive review \n     of the mental health care programs of the Armed Forces under \n     the jurisdiction of that Secretary in order to determine ways \n     to improve the efficacy of such care, including a review of \n     joint Department of Defense and Department of Veterans \n     Affairs clinical guidelines to ensure a seamless delivery of \n     care during transitions from active duty or reserve status to \n     civilian life.\n       (b) Report to Congress.--The Secretary of Defense shall \n     submit to Congress a report setting forth the results of such \n     review not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment \n     of this Act.\n\n                       Subtitle C--Other Matters\n\n     SEC. 121. AUTHORITY OF DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS \n                   PHARMACIES TO DISPENSE MEDICATIONS TO VETERANS \n                   ON PRESCRIPTIONS WRITTEN BY PRIVATE \n                   PRACTITIONERS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Under longstanding regulations of the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs, most veterans who receive prescriptions for \n     medication from private doctors are forced to complete \n     physicals conducted by Department of Veterans Affairs \n     physicians before the veterans can have their prescriptions \n     filled by a pharmacy. This bureaucratic red tape can prevent \n     veterans from quickly receiving the medical treatment they \n     need.\n       (2) In December 2000, the Inspector General of the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs reported that eliminating this \n     unnecessary red tape would save the underfunded Department of \n     Veterans Affairs over $1,000,000,000 per year. The report \n     concluded that ``a decision to continue the current policies \n     results in inefficiency and waste that we estimate annually \n     costs the Department over $1,000,000,000 in resources that \n     could be better used in the delivery of healthcare services \n     to veterans.''.\n       (3) In 2004, the Department of Justice, in a reversal of an \n     earlier legal opinion, stating that the Secretary of Veterans \n     Affairs has the authority to eliminate this rule without \n     further legislative action. The Secretary has failed to take \n     such a step, thus necessitating action by Congress.\n       (b) Authority.--Section 1712 of title 38, United States \n     Code, is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating subsection (e) as subsection (f); and\n       (2) by inserting after subsection (d) the following new \n     subsection (e):\n       ``(e)(1) The Secretary shall furnish to any medicare-\n     eligible veteran on an out-patient basis such drugs and \n     medicines as may be ordered on prescription of a duly \n     licensed physician as specific therapy in the treatment of \n     any illness or injury suffered by such veteran.\n       ``(2) In this subsection, the term `medicare-eligible \n     veteran' means any veteran who--\n       ``(A) is entitled to or enrolled in hospital insurance \n     benefits under part A of title XVIII of the Social Security \n     Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.); or\n       ``(B) is enrolled in the supplementary medical insurance \n     program under part B of such title (42 U.S.C. 1395j et seq.).\n       ``(3) The furnishing of drugs and medicines under this \n     subsection shall be subject to the provisions of section \n     1722A(b) of this title.''.\n       (c) Copayment Requirements.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 1722A of such title is amended--\n       (A) in subsection (a)(1), by inserting ``(other than a \n     veteran covered by subsection (b))'' after ``require a \n     veteran'';\n       (B) by redesignating subsections (b) and (c) as subsections \n     (c) and (d), respectively;\n       (C) by inserting after subsection (a) the following new \n     subsection (b):\n       ``(b)(1) In the case of a veteran who is furnished \n     medications on an out-patient basis under section 1712(e) of \n     this title, the Secretary shall require the veteran to pay, \n     at the election of the Secretary, one or more of the \n     following:\n       ``(A) An annual enrollment fee in an amount determined \n     appropriate by the Secretary.\n       ``(B) A copayment for each 30-day supply of such \n     medications in an amount determined appropriate by the \n     Secretary.\n       ``(C) An amount equal to the cost to the Secretary of such \n     medications, as determined by the Secretary.\n       ``(2)(A) In determining the amounts to be paid by a veteran \n     under paragraph (1), and the basis of payment under one or \n     more subparagraphs of that paragraph, the Secretary shall \n     ensure that the total amount paid by veterans for medications \n     under that paragraph in a year is not less than the costs of \n     the Department in furnishing medications to veterans under \n     section 1712(e) of this title during that year, including the \n     cost of purchasing and furnishing medications, and other \n     costs of administering that section.\n       ``(B) The Secretary shall take appropriate actions to \n     ensure, to the maximum extent practicable, that amounts paid \n     by veterans under paragraph (1) in a year are equal to the \n     costs of the Department referred to in subparagraph (A) in \n     that year.\n       ``(3) In determining amounts under paragraph (1), the \n     Secretary may take into account the following:\n       ``(A) Whether or not the medications furnished are generic \n     medications or brand name medications.\n       ``(B) Whether or not the medications are furnished by mail.\n       ``(C) Whether or not the medications furnished are listed \n     on the National Prescription Drug Formulary of the \n     Department.\n       ``(D) Any other matters the Secretary considers \n     appropriate.\n\n[[Page S172]]\n\n       ``(4) The Secretary may from time to time adjust any amount \n     determined by the Secretary under paragraph (1), as \n     previously adjusted under this paragraph, in order to meet \n     the purpose specified in paragraph (2).''; and\n       (D) in subsection (d), as so redesignated--\n       (i) by striking ``subsection (a)'' and inserting \n     ``subsections (a) and (b)''; and\n       (ii) by striking ``subsection (b)'' and inserting \n     ``subsection (c)''.\n       (2) Deposit of collections in medical care collections \n     fund.--Paragraph (4) of section 1729A(b) of such title is \n     amended to read as follows:\n       ``(4) Subsection (a) or (b) of section 1722A of this \n     title.''.\n       (d) Clerical Amendments.--(1) The heading for section 1712 \n     of such title is amended by striking ``for certain disabled \n     veterans''.\n       (2) The table of sections at the beginning of chapter 17 of \n     such title is amended in the item relating to section 1712 by \n     striking ``for certain disabled veterans''.\n\n   TITLE II--CONCURRENT RECEIPT OF RETIRED PAY AND SERVICE-CONNECTED \n                        DISABILITY COMPENSATION\n\n     SEC. 201. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Retired Pay Restoration \n     Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 202. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States Government has an essential \n     obligation to provide support and care for men and women who \n     have completed honorable military service in defense of the \n     Nation. In no instance is this obligation more critical than \n     for veterans who were injured or disabled during their \n     military service.\n       (2) Disability compensation and military retired pay are \n     benefits earned for two distinct reasons. Disability \n     compensation is provided to veterans for disabilities \n     resulting from their military service to the Nation as an \n     expression of the Nation's gratitude and as recompense for \n     their sacrifice. Military retired pay is earned by members of \n     the Armed Forces for the devotion of 20 or more years of \n     their lives to the military service of the Nation.\n       (3) Until 2002, Federal law prohibited disabled veterans \n     from concurrently receiving both disability compensation and \n     retirement pay. The prohibition against concurrent receipt \n     was a gross violation of the Government's commitment to \n     veterans.\n       (4) Despite recent legislative advances, over 1,500,000 \n     disabled veterans continue to be prohibited from receiving \n     both military retirement and disability payments \n     concurrently.\n\n     SEC. 203.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In its final report, the President's Task Force To \n     Improve Health Care Delivery For Our Nation's Veterans found \n     that ``. . . increased collaboration between the Departments \n     [of Defense and Veterans Affairs] for the transfer of \n     personnel and health information is needed. Within VA, \n     broader sharing of the information received from the DOD and \n     individual veterans is required so that veterans are not met \n     at every turn with the question, `Who are you and what do you \n     want?' A `seamless transition' from military service to \n     veteran status is especially critical in the context of \n     health care, where readily available, accurate, and current \n     medical information must be accessible to health care \n     providers''.\n       (2) The Task Force put forward a series of seven \n     recommendations designed to create a seamless transition from \n     military service to veteran status. Nearly two years after \n     the submittal of its final report, few of the recommendations \n     have been adopted.\n       (3) Leading nonpartisan veterans' advocates, including the \n     American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars, Disabled American \n     Veterans, and the Military Officers Association of America, \n     support the adoption of the recommendations made by the Task \n     Force to create a seamless transition from military service \n     to veteran status.\n\n     SEC. 302.

FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) Disability is a natural part of the human experience \n     and in no way diminishes the right of individuals to \n     participate in or contribute to society. Improving \n     educational results for children with disabilities is an \n     essential element of our national policy of ensuring equality \n     of opportunity, full participation, independent living, and \n     economic self-sufficiency for individuals with disabilities.\n       (2) Before the date of enactment of the Education for All \n     Handicapped Children Act of 1975 (Public Law 94-142), the \n     predecessor to the Individuals with Disabilities Education \n     Act (20 U.S.C. 1400 et seq.), the educational needs of \n     millions of children with disabilities were not being fully \n     met because--\n       (A) the children did not receive appropriate educational \n     services;\n       (B) the children were excluded entirely from the public \n     school system and from being educated with their peers;\n       (C) undiagnosed disabilities prevented the children from \n     having a successful educational experience; or\n       (D) a lack of adequate resources within the public school \n     system forced such families to find services outside the \n     public school system.\n       (3) The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act has \n     been successful in ensuring children with disabilities and \n     the families of such children access to a free appropriate \n     public education and in improving educational results for \n     children with disabilities.\n       (4) The implementation of the Individuals with Disabilities \n     Education Act has been impeded by the Federal Government's \n     failure to honor the commitment it made 30 years ago to \n     provide States with 40 percent of the excess costs of special \n     education.\n       (5) While States, local educational agencies, and \n     educational service agencies are primarily responsible for \n     providing an education for all children with disabilities, it \n     is in the national interest that the Federal Government have \n     a supporting role in assisting State and local efforts to \n     educate children with disabilities in order to improve \n     results for such children and to ensure equal protection of \n     the law.\n       (6) Congress passed authorizing language to fully fund the \n     Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and should \n     appropriate such sums as authorized.\n       (7) A more equitable allocation of resources is essential \n     for the Federal Government to meet its responsibility to \n     provide an equal educational opportunity for all individuals.\n\n     SEC. 302.

SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) Congress enacted, with bipartisan support, and the \n     President signed into law the No Child Left Behind Act of \n     2001 (Public Law 107-210; 115 Stat. 1425), that reauthorized \n     the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. \n     6301 et seq.). The new law required States to set high \n     standards for learning and required schools to implement \n     reforms to help improve student achievement. In return, \n     Congress and the President pledged to make sure schools would \n     have resources to carry out the reforms as called for in the \n     new law.\n       (2) $22,750,000,000 is needed to fund part A of title I of \n     the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. \n     6311 et seq.) in fiscal year 2006, as promised pursuant to \n     the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (Public Law 107-210; 115 \n     Stat. 1425).\n       (3) $25,000,000,000 is needed to fund part A of title I of \n     the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. \n     6311 et seq.) in fiscal year 2007, as promised pursuant to \n     the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (Public Law 107-210; 115 \n     Stat. 1425).\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) it is in the best interest of the Nation that all \n     students have access to a high-quality elementary and \n     secondary education; and\n       (2) part A of title I of the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6311 et seq.) should be \n     funded as promised pursuant to the No Child Left Behind Act \n     of 2001 (Public Law 107-210; 115 Stat. 1425).\n\n    TITLE VII--PROVIDING A ROADMAP FOR FIRST GENERATION COLLEGE FOR \n                                STUDENTS\n\n     SEC. 701.

Reg. 76926), shall not apply to a student to the extent \n     the updates will reduce the amount of Federal student \n     assistance for which the student is eligible.\n\n     SEC. 802. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING INCREASING THE \n                   MAXIMUM PELL GRANT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Increasing the percentage of individuals who obtain a \n     postsecondary education has become increasingly important, \n     not just to the individual beneficiary, but to the Nation as \n     a whole. The growth and continued expansion of the Nation's \n     economy is heavily dependent on an educated and highly \n     skilled workforce.\n       (2) The opportunity to gain a postsecondary education also \n     is important to the Nation as a means to help advance the \n     American ideals of progress and equality.\n       (3) The Federal Government plays an invaluable role in \n     making student financial aid available to ensure that \n     qualified students are able to attend college, regardless of \n     their financial means. Since the inception of the Pell Grant \n     program in 1973, nearly 80,000,000 grants have helped low- \n     and middle-income students go to college, enrich their lives, \n     and become productive members of society.\n       (4) Nationwide, almost 63 percent of secondary school \n     graduates continue on to higher education immediately after \n     completing secondary school. This degree of college \n     participation would not exist without the Federal investment \n     in student aid, especially the Pell Grant program. More than \n     4,000,000 low- and middle-income students receive Pell \n     Grants; 95 percent of whom have a family income of not more \n     than $40,000.\n       (5) In the next 10 years, the number of undergraduate \n     students enrolled in the Nation's colleges and universities \n     will increase by 15 percent to more than 15,000,000 students. \n     Many of these students will be the first in their families to \n     attend college. The continued investment in the Pell Grant \n     program is essential if college is to remain an achievable \n     part of the American dream.\n       (6) Increasing the maximum Pell Grant to $5,100 would allow \n     more than 430,000 additional students to benefit from the \n     program.\n       (7) Increasing the maximum Pell Grant to $5,100 would \n     result in 200,000 new Pell Grant recipients.\n\n[[Page S182]]\n\n       (8) Pell Grant recipients are more likely to graduate with \n     student loan debt and to amass more debt than other student \n     borrowers. Increasing the maximum Pell Grant to $5,100 will \n     help remedy this disparity.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the maximum Pell Grant should be increased to $5,100 \n     during award year 2006-2007; and\n       (2) the maximum Pell Grant amount set by Congress should be \n     the amount eligible students receive.\n\n     SEC. 803. ESTABLISHMENT OF A PELL DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that:\n       (1) A student remains eligible to receive a Federal Pell \n     Grant as long as the student is income-eligible and has not \n     received a bachelor's degree.\n       (2) By encouraging persistence and degree acquisition in a \n     timely manner, the Federal Government, in effect, saves \n     money--\n       (A) by reducing the courses that do not lead to a degree; \n     and\n       (B) by helping students get the financial benefits of a \n     college degree as soon as possible.\n       (b) Pell Demonstration Program.--\n       (1) Authorization.--The Secretary of Education shall \n     establish a demonstration program to facilitate the ability \n     of low-income students to complete the students' degree \n     within 150 percent of the time expected to complete such \n     degree.\n       (2) Grants.--The Secretary of Education shall award \n     competitive grants to institutions of higher education to \n     enable students who are eligible to receive Federal Pell \n     Grants under subpart 1 of part A of title IV of the Higher \n     Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1070a et seq.) to enroll in \n     courses in the summer at such institutions to expedite the \n     students' graduation from the institutions.\n       (3) Authorization of appropriations.--There is authorized \n     to be appropriated to carry out this subsection $500,000,000 \n     for the period of fiscal years 2006 through 2008.\n\n TITLE IX--TUITION FREE COLLEGE FOR MATHEMATICS, SCIENCE, AND SPECIAL \n                           EDUCATION TEACHERS\n\n     SEC. 901.

A bill to reduce to the cost of quality health care coverage \nand improve the availability of health care coverage for all Americans; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it's an honor to join our Democratic \nLeader and so many of our colleagues in introducing the Affordable \nHealth Care Act.\n  This legislation states our strong commitment as Democrats to end the \ncrisis in health care that affects every family. It's a down payment on \nour commitment to quality, affordable health care for every American, \nand we\n\n[[Page S184]]\n\nwill not rest until that goal is achieved.\n  The worsening crisis in health care is caused by skyrocketing costs, \ndeclining insurance coverage, and less security for every family. \nBusinesses--especially small businesses--find it increasingly difficult \nto provide decent coverage for their employees. Companies struggling \nwith foreign competition are at an every-larger competitive \ndisadvantage because of their constantly rising costs.\n  Last year, the percentage of the Nation's gross domestic product \ndevoted to health was 15.5%, the highest in our history. Since 2000, \nannual spending on health care has risen from $1.3 trillion to $1.7 \ntrillion, an increase of almost half a trillion dollars in just four \nyears.\n  Even worse, insurance premiums have soared by 59 percent during those \nfour years. The cost of insurance for a family has risen by almost \n$3,000. Last year, the cost of the premiums for family coverage \naveraged $10,000, and was much higher for many families.\n  Drug costs are also out of control. According to current data, they \nrose 47 percent in the first three years of the Bush Administration. \nToo many patients are cutting the pills their doctors prescribe in half \nor going without them altogether, because they can't afford the drugs \nthey need to treat or prevent disease.\n  Even Medicare premiums are out of control. The largest premium \nincrease in Medicare's history went into effect just three weeks ago. \nSince President Bush took office, Medicare premiums have climbed by 72 \npercent. Senior citizens, with an average income of $15,000, now have \nto pay almost $1,000 a year for their Part B premiums under Medicare. \nThe recent report of the Medicare trustees included the stunning \nrevelation that Medicare cost sharing and premiums will soon eat up \nmore than 40 percent of the total Social Security benefit of the \ntypical 85 year old.\n  As a proportion of Gross Domestic Product spent on health care, \nAmerica is first in the world by a large margin. We spend 30 percent \nmore than the Swiss who are number two, a third more than the Germans, \nfifty percent more than the French and the Canadians, and seventy-eight \npercent more than the Japanese.\n  These extraordinarily high levels of health spending might be \njustified if they produced dramatically better health care for the \nAmerican people. But they don't. Among the world's leading \nindustrialized countries, the United States ranks 22nd in average life \nexpectancy and 25th in infant mortality.\n  We also face a worsening crisis of the uninsured. Since President \nBush took office, the number of uninsured Americans has increased by a \nshameful million a year. Today, 45 million Americans have no coverage. \nBetween 2001 and 2004, five million jobs offering health insurance were \nlost.\n  Even these figures understate the problem. Over a two-year period, 82 \nmillion Americans--one out of every three non-elderly Americans--will \nbe uninsured for a significant period of time.\n  Tragically, eight and a half million children are uninsured and may \nwell be denied the opportunity for a healthy start in life that should \nbe the birthright of every child. Even people who have health insurance \ntoday cannot count on it being there for them tomorrow. No American \nfamily is more than one pink slip or one employer decision away from \nbeing uninsured.\n  The uninsured are vulnerable not only to unaffordable costs, but to \nsubstandard or health care or no care at all. In any given year, one-\nthird of the uninsured go without needed medical care. Two hundred \nseventy thousand children suffering from asthma never see a doctor. \nThree hundred fifty thousand children with recurrent earaches never see \na doctor. Three hundred fifty thousand children with severe sore \nthroats never see a doctor.\n  Twenty-seven thousand uninsured women are diagnosed with breast \ncancer each year. They are twice as likely as insured women not to \nreceive medical treatment until their cancer has spread too far, and \nthey are 50 percent more likely to die of the disease.\n  Thirty-two thousand Americans with heart disease go without life-\nsaving and life-enhancing bypass surgery or angioplasty--because they \nare uninsured.\n  The bottom line is that whether the disease is AIDS or mental illness \nor cancer or heart disease or diabetes, the uninsured are left out and \nleft behind. In hospital and out, young or old, black or brown or \nwhite, they receive less care, suffer more, and are 25 percent more \nlikely to die prematurely than those who have insurance.\n  Even for those with insurance, the quality of health care is often \nneedlessly compromised. Recent events cast serious doubt on the FDA's \nability to respond promptly when drugs it has approved turn out to have \ndangerous side effects. By some estimates, tens of thousands of \nunnecessary deaths have resulted.\n  The lack of coordination in our system results in duplicative, \ncostly, and often counterproductive tests and procedures. The Midwest \nBusiness Group on Health estimates that the cost of poor quality care \nto employers providing health insurance coverage is $2,000 per worker, \nand it's paid in the form of higher insurance premiums. A recent study \nfound that for many serious illnesses, patients are as likely to \nreceive substandard care as they are to receive care meeting accepted \nprofessional standards.\n  In the face of this massive crisis in health care, the Administration \nand Congress have been missing in action for too long. The Bush \nAdministration and the Republican leadership in Congress defend the \nspecial interests that profit from the status quo and ignore the \nsuffering of the millions of families victimized by their neglect.\n  Reports suggest in fact that the Administration's new budget will \npropose to cut Medicaid, which provides health care for more than 50 \nmillion of the poorest of the poor. The deficit must be addressed--but \nit was created by the Administration's tax breaks for the wealthy, and \nthe poor and the sick should not have to bear the burden of reducing \nit. That's the wrong priority and the wrong values.\n  The legislation we are offering today will not solve all these \nproblems, but it is a good start, and we are committed to finishing the \njob.\n  The Affordable Health Care Act guarantees that every child in America \nwill have quality health care coverage.\n  It reduces health costs substantially, by making FDA-approved drugs \navailable at the same fair prices available to Canadians and Europeans, \nrather than the inflated prices charged to U.S. patients.\n  It takes a giant step toward adoption of modern information \ntechnology in health care, which has the potential to dramatically \nimprove the quality of care and dramatically reduce its cost--by as \nmuch as $140 billion a year. It also improves quality by giving the FDA \nadditional authority to monitor the safety of approved drugs.\n  It addresses the special burden faced by small businesses by offering \ntax credits to reduce the premiums they pay to cover their employees. \nIt also establishes a demonstration program in 25 cities to see if a \nsuccessful program in Michigan to expand insurance coverage for small \nbusinesses can be replicated elsewhere. Finally, our bill includes a \nsense of the Senate resolution to put Congress firmly on record against \ndestructive cuts in Medicaid.\n  Affordable health care is a high priority for every family, and it \nshould be an equally high priority for this Congress. We face a crisis, \nand it is time to act. Senate Democrats are committed to guaranteeing \nthe basic right to health care for all Americans, and when we say \n``all'', we mean ``all''.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 16\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Need for universal coverage.--\n       (A) Currently, there are 9,000,000 children under the age \n     of 19 that are uninsured. One out of every 8 children are \n     uninsured while 1 in 5 Hispanic children and 1 in 7 African \n     American children are uninsured. Three-quarters, \n     approximately 6,800,000, of these children are eligible but \n     not enrolled in the medicaid program or the State children's \n     health insurance program (SCHIP). Long-range studies found \n     that 1 in 3 children went without health insurance for all or \n     part of 2002 and 2003.\n       (B) Low-income children are 3 times as likely as children \n     in higher income families to be uninsured. It is estimated \n     that 65 percent of uninsured children have at least 1 parent \n     working full time over the course of the year.\n       (C) It is estimated that 50 percent of all legal immigrant \n     children in families with income that is less than 200 \n     percent of the Federal poverty line are uninsured. In States \n     without programs to cover immigrant children, 57 percent of \n     non-citizen children are uninsured.\n       (D) Children in the Southern and Western parts of the \n     United States were nearly 1.7 times more likely to be \n     uninsured than children in the Northeast. In the Northeast, \n     9.4 percent of children are uninsured while in the Midwest, \n     8.3 percent are uninsured. The South's rate of uninsured \n     children is 14.3 percent while the West has an uninsured rate \n     of 13 percent.\n       (E) Children's health care needs are neglected in the \n     United States. One-quarter of young children in the United \n     States are not fully up to date on their basic immunizations. \n     One-third of children with chronic asthma do not get a \n     prescription for the necessary medications to manage the \n     disease.\n       (F) According to the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention, nearly \\1/2\\ of all uninsured children have not \n     had a well-child visit in the past year. One out of every 5 \n     children has problems accessing needed care, and 1 out of \n     every 4 children do not receive annual dental exams. One in 6 \n     uninsured children had a delayed or unmet medical need in the \n     past year. Minority children are less likely to receive \n     proven treatments such as prescription medications to treat \n     chronic disease.\n       (G) There are 7,600,000 young adults between the ages of 19 \n     and 20. In the United States, approximately 28 percent, or \n     2,100,000 individuals, of this group are uninsured.\n       (H) Chronic illness and disability among children are on \n     the rise. Children most at risk for chronic illness and \n     disability are children who are most likely to be poor and \n     uninsured.\n       (2) Role of the medicaid and state children's health \n     insurance programs.--\n       (A) The medicaid program and SCHIP serve as a crucial \n     health safety net for 30,000,000 children. During the recent \n     economic downturn and the highest number of uninsured \n     individuals ever recorded in the United States, the medicaid \n     program and SCHIP offset losses in employer-sponsored \n     coverage. While the number of children living in low-income \n     families increased by 2,000,000 between 2000 and 2003, the \n     number of uninsured children fell due to the medicaid program \n     and SCHIP.\n       (B) In 2003, 25,000,000 children were enrolled in the \n     medicaid program, accounting for \\1/2\\ of all enrollees and \n     only 19 percent of total program costs.\n       (C) The medicaid program and SCHIP do more than just fill \n     in the gaps. Gains in public coverage have reduced the \n     percentage of low-income uninsured by a \\1/3\\ from 1997 to \n     2003. In addition, a recent study found that publicly-insured \n     children are more likely to obtain medical care, preventive \n     care and dental care than similar low-income privately -\n     insured children.\n       (D) Publicly funded programs such as the medicaid program \n     and SCHIP actually improve children's health. Children who \n     are currently insured by public programs are in better health \n     than they were a year ago. Expansion of coverage for children \n     and pregnant women under the medicaid program and SCHIP \n     reduces rates of avoidable hospitalizations by 22 percent.\n       (E) Studies have found that children enrolled in public \n     insurance programs experienced a 68 percent improvement in \n     measures of school performance.\n       (F) Despite the success of expansions in general under the \n     medicaid program and SCHIP, due to current budget \n     constraints, many States have stopped doing aggressive \n     outreach and have raised premiums and cost-sharing \n     requirements on families under these programs. In addition, 8 \n     States stopped enrollment in SCHIP for a period of time \n     between April 2003 and July 2004. As a result, SCHIP \n     enrollment fell by 200,000 children for the first time in the \n     program's history.\n       (G) It is estimated that nearly 50 percent of children \n     covered through SCHIP do not remain in the program due to \n     reenrollment barriers. A recent study found that between 10 \n     and 40 percent of these children are ``lost'' in the system. \n     Difficult renewal policies and reenrollment barriers make \n     seamless coverage in SCHIP unattainable. Studies indicate \n     that as many as 67 percent of children who were eligible but \n     not enrolled for SCHIP had applied for coverage but were \n     denied due to procedural issues.\n       (H) While the medicaid program and SCHIP expansions to date \n     have done much to offset what otherwise would have been a \n     significant loss of coverage among children because of \n     declining access to employer coverage, the shortcomings of \n     previous expansions, such as the failure to enroll all \n     eligible children and caps on enrollment in SCHIP because of \n     under-funding, also are clear.\n\n   CHAPTER 1--EXPANDED COVERAGE OF CHILDREN UNDER MEDICAID AND SCHIP\n\n     SEC. 301.

SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Medicaid program under title XIX of the Social \n     Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.) provides essential \n     health care and long-term care coverage to more than \n     50,000,000 low-income children, pregnant women and families, \n     individuals with disabilities, and senior citizens. It is a \n     Federal guarantee that even the most vulnerable will have \n     access to needed medical services.\n       (2) Medicaid provides health insurance for more than \\1/4\\ \n     of America's children and is the largest purchaser of \n     maternity care, paying for more than \\1/3\\ of all the births \n     in the United States each year.\n       (3) Medicaid provides critical help for the elderly and \n     individuals living with disabilities. Medicaid is America's \n     single largest purchaser of nursing home services and other \n     long-term care, covering the majority of nursing home \n     residents.\n       (4) Medicaid pays for personal care and other supportive \n     services, which are typically not provided by private health \n     insurance, even if individuals could obtain it. These \n     services are necessary to enable individuals with spinal cord \n     injuries, developmental disabilities, neurological \n     degenerative diseases, serious and persistent mental \n     illnesses, HIV/AIDS, and other chronic conditions to remain \n     in the community, to work, and to maintain independence.\n       (5) Medicaid is an essential supplement to the Medicare \n     program under title XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 1395 et seq.) for more than 6,000,000 Medicare \n     beneficiaries who are low-income elderly or disabled, \n     assisting them with their Medicare premiums and co-insurance, \n     wrap-around benefits, and, in most States, the costs of \n     nursing home care that Medicare does not cover.\n       (6) About 42 percent of all Medicaid spending is for those \n     who are elderly or are living with disabilities and are \n     dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid.\n       (7) Medicaid faces an ever growing burden as a result of \n     Medicare's gaps. The Medicaid program spent nearly \n     $40,000,000,000 on uncovered Medicare services in 2002. \n     Medicaid payments for low-income Medicare beneficiary cost-\n     sharing are the largest and fastest growing share of Medicaid \n     spending.\n       (8) The Medicare drug benefit imposes additional costs on \n     States, which will add to the already significant long-term \n     care cost burden. Medicaid spending on Medicare \n     beneficiaries' long-term care costs is expected to double \n     from $25,000,000,000 in 2002 to $51,000,000,000 in 2012.\n       (9) Medicaid helps ensure access to care for all Americans. \n     Medicaid is the single largest source of revenue for the \n     Nation's safety net hospitals and health centers and is \n     critical to the ability of those providers to serve Medicaid \n     enrollees and uninsured Americans.\n       (10) Medicaid serves a major role in ensuring that the \n     number of Americans without health insurance, approximately \n     45,000,000 in 2003, is not substantially higher. Medicaid \n     helps buffer the drop in private coverage during recessions. \n     More than 4,800,000 Americans lost employer sponsored \n     coverage between 2000 and 2003. Medicaid covered an \n     additional 5,800,000 Americans during this period, preventing \n     even greater numbers of uninsured.\n       (11) Medicaid matters to women in America. More than \n     16,000,000 women depend on Medicaid for their health care. \n     Women comprise the majority of seniors (71 percent) on \n     Medicaid. Half of nonelderly women with permanent mental or \n     physical disabilities have health coverage through Medicaid. \n     Medicaid provides treatment for low-income women diagnosed \n     with breast or cervical cancer in every State.\n       (12) Medicaid is critical for children with disabilities. \n     Medicaid covers 78 percent of poor children with disabilities \n     who are under\n\n[[Page S203]]\n\n     5 years of age and 70 percent of poor children with \n     disabilities who are between the ages of 5 and 17. Similarly, \n     Medicaid covers a substantial portion of children with \n     disabilities who are near poor, covering 40 percent of \n     children with disabilities who are under 5 years of age and \n     25 percent of children with disabilities who are between the \n     ages of 5 and 17.\n       (13) Medicaid is the Nation's largest source of payment for \n     mental health services, HIV/AIDS care, and care for children \n     with special needs. Much of this care is either not covered \n     by private insurance or limited in scope or duration. \n     Medicaid is also a critical source of funding for health care \n     for children in foster care and for health services in \n     schools.\n       (14) The need for Medicaid is greater than ever today, \n     because the number of Americans living in poverty has \n     increased by 8,000,000 over the last 4 years and the number \n     of the uninsured has increased by 5,000,000.\n       (15) The system of Federal matching for State Medicaid \n     expenditures ensures that Federal funds will grow as State \n     spending increases in response to unmet needs.\n       (16) Despite the varied population served by the Medicaid \n     program, including those with significant health care needs, \n     Medicaid per capita growth has been consistently about half \n     the rate of growth in private insurance premiums and Medicaid \n     has far lower administrative costs. Medicaid costs less per \n     person than private coverage for people who have similar \n     health status.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the Medicaid program under title XIX of the Social \n     Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.) is a critical component \n     of the health care system of the United States;\n       (2) Federal support for the Medicaid program must be \n     adequate to support State spending meeting the essential \n     health needs of the low-income elderly, low-income \n     individuals with disabilities, and low-income children and \n     families, and should not be cut or capped; and\n       (3) any retreat from the Federal commitment to Medicaid \n     would threaten not only the health care safety net of the \n     United States but the entire health care system\n\n        TITLE IV--REDUCING HEALTH CARE COSTS FOR SMALL EMPLOYERS\n\n                         Subtitle A--Tax Relief\n\n     SEC. 401.

Mr. President, the Bush Administration and the \nRepublican Congress are no friend of America's seniors. In 2003, they \nenacted legislation to dismantle Medicare, even though Medicare has \nhelped a generation of seniors live their golden years with health and \ndignity.\n  Now their target is Social Security. They want to privatize this \ntrusted program for the benefit of Wall Street bankers. They even want \nto cut benefits for women because--in the Republican view--they live \ntoo long. It's time to end these shameful attacks on our senior \ncitizens, restore Medicare and protect Social Security.\n  I commend the leadership of my colleague from Minnesota, Senator \nDayton, and our Democratic Leader, Senator Reid, in introducing this \nurgently needed legislation today to enable Medicare to keep its \npromise to the elderly.\n  Forty years ago, Congress enacted the landmark legislation that \nestablished Medicare. We would do well today to remember President \nLyndon Johnson's words on signing that historic bill in 1965: ``No \nlonger will older Americans be denied the healing miracle of modern \nmedicine. No longer will illness crush and destroy the savings they \nhave so carefully put away over a lifetime so that they might enjoy \ndignity in their later years.''\n  The ruinous Medicare legislation that the Republican Congress enacted \nin 2003 breaks that solemn promise.\n  Before Medicare was created, millions of seniors could obtain health \ncare coverage only at the whim of the insurance industry. If they were \ntoo sick or too poor to be profitable to an insurance company, they \nwould be denied health care coverage. Their savings--and their \nchildren's savings--were in jeopardy when illness struck. Before \nMedicare, senior citizens were among the poorest Americans, with almost \nthree in ten living in poverty. Bankruptcies from overwhelming medical \nbills were common.\n  Medicare changed all that, and 40 years later, President Bush and the \nRepublican Congress are wrong to try to turn back the clock.\n  Some of my colleagues attempt to portray Medicare as a failure. But \nthe facts show that it is one of the most successful endeavors the \nNation has ever undertaken. In 1963, before Medicare was enacted, \nalmost half of America's seniors were uninsured. Today that number is \none in a hundred.\n  Before Medicare was enacted, Americans turning 65 could expect to \nlive another 14 years. Today, they can expect almost 18 more years.\n  Seniors understand that Medicare works. They don't want to return to \nthe days when they had to gamble their health, their savings and their \nlives on risky private insurance.\n  The 2003 Republican bill was sold to the American people as a way to \nhelp seniors with the high cost of prescription drugs, so you might \nthink it does something about the high cost of drugs. But it doesn't.\n  It not only fails to help Medicare lower the cost of drugs--it \nactually makes it illegal for Medicare to try. Republicans were so \nworried about protecting drug company profits that they made it illegal \nfor Medicare to do what\n\n[[Page S209]]\n\nthe Veterans Administration does for veterans--negotiate discounts on \ndrug prices. The Bush Administration and the GOP Congress wouldn't dare \nto prohibit the VA from doing that for the veterans, and they shouldn't \ndo it for senior citizens either.\n  The discounts on drug prices for veterans are substantial. On \naverage, the price paid by the VA is 45 percent of the retail price, \nbut often, the savings are even more dramatic. The retail price for \nMevacor is $4 a pill, but the VA pays only 23 cents. The undiscounted \nprice of Zantac is $1.83, but the VA pays two cents.\n  Senator Dayton's legislation abolishes the unconscionable provision \nthat bars Medicare from negotiating discounts on drug prices for \nAmerica's seniors. That's not price control--it's common sense.\n  Republicans also claim that their new drug benefit is ``voluntary.'' \nNot exactly. If seniors don't sign up the first year, they have to pay \nmore and more to join in subsequent years. When they need the coverage, \nthey may not be able to afford it.\n  Senator Dayton's legislation reverses this flagrant system of fines \nand makes the Medicare drug program truly voluntary. When Congress \nenacts it, seniors will be able to sign up for the drug program without \nfacing ruinous fines.\n  Good prescription drug coverage for senior citizens is a priority for \nDemocrats. For the Administration and the Republicans in Congress, \nhowever, tax cuts for billionaires are more important than health care \nfor senior citizens.\n  In addition, the 2003 Medicare law leaves too many elderly citizens \nwith unaffordable costs. Seniors with moderate incomes and high drug \nexpenses still face high drug costs. The benefits under the GOP law--\nwith its $250 deductible, 25 percent cost-sharing, an out-of-pocket \nlimit of $3,600 on costs, but continued co-payment obligations even \nafter the limit is reached--are far less generous than those enjoyed by \nmost younger Americans, even though the elderly's need for prescription \ndrugs is much greater.\n  Senior citizens with an income of $15,000 and drug expenses of $4,000 \nwould have to pay more than $2,900, including premiums, out of their \nown pocket. That's too heavy a burden.\n  If they fall into the so-called doughnut hole, their situation is \nmuch worse. Under the 2003 law, the government makes no contribution to \nany drug costs between $2,250 in expenditures and $5,100 in \nexpenditures. Patients who need $5,200 worth of prescriptions could be \nforced to pay $2,850 in drug expenses without any help at all from \nMedicare. That's too much for an elderly person to pay and still meet \nother essential medical needs, pay the rent or mortgage, and buy food \nand other necessities of life.\n\n  Senator Dayton's proposal begins to fill in that doughnut hole by not \nallowing the cap on total out of pocket expenditures to rise year after \nyear, as it does under the GOP act. Under Senator Dayton's proposal, \nseniors will have the certainty of knowing where that limit is from one \nyear to the next. As drug expenses rise, more seniors will gain the \nbenefit of the assistance from Medicare at these high spending levels, \nand ultimately, the doughnut hole will close.\n  The Republican Medicare law is a raw deal for seniors, but it's a \nbonanza for the drug industry and the insurance industry.\n  It gives massive subsidies to HMOs. Most Americans probably think \nit's the job of insurance companies to guarantee the health of their \nbeneficiaries, but according to the Republican view that's wrong. They \nmake America's seniors guarantee the health and wealth of HMOs.\n  The government already pays private insurance plans 104 percent of \nwhat it costs Medicare to provide seniors with the same health care. \nRepublicans claim to be in favor of competition, but the playing field \nis tilted toward HMOs, and their 2003 Act tilted it further. You might \nthink HMOs need that overpayment because they serve sicker or needier \nbeneficiaries. Not true. Enrollees in private plans are actually \nhealthier than those in Medicare, resulting in a further bonus of 8.7 \npercent to the private plans.\n  Senator Dayton's legislation requires realistic risk adjustment for \nprivate plans that provide services to seniors under Medicare. It \nremoves the artificial calculations that inflate payments to HMOs and \nother private insurance carriers.\n  Another problem with the 2003 Act is that if the subsidies don't \nprovide enough profits, the Republican bill provides cash handouts for \nthe insurance industry. If an HMO doesn't think it can make enough \nmoney in some area of the country, the Bush Administration can simply \nladle out the cash--up to $12 billion a year--until the bribe is high \nenough to get the company to participate.\n  Senator Dayton's legislation reverses this outrageous giveaway and \nensures that the dollars devoted to this slush fund are used instead to \nprovide better health care for seniors.\n  The Republican law stacks the deck against seniors in other ways. It \nallows a region to be served by only one prescription drug plan, along \nwith a PPO. That gives the drug plan a monopoly in that region for \nseniors who want to remain in Medicare. If the only available drug plan \nis tailored to the healthiest and youngest seniors, it might be \nacceptable for a senior whose prescription needs are limited. But it \ngives no help to seniors who take medications for multiple chronic \nconditions every day. Seniors have no real recourse if they can't \nafford the monopoly drug plan. The only way they can get prescription \ndrug coverage is to enroll in the PPO.\n  Senator Dayton's legislation provides an effective guarantee that \nseniors who wish to remain in traditional Medicare will have a genuine \nchoice of prescription-only plans. If a choice between at least two \nprivate drug-only plans is not available in any region, the Federal \nGovernment will provide a plan. This proposal ensures that any senior \nwho wishes to remain in Medicare will have access to high-quality \naffordable prescription drug coverage.\n\n  The Republican Medicare law also dealt a harsh blow to the employer \nplans that millions of retirees depend on. The Congressional Budget \nOffice estimates that almost three million retirees will lose their \ncurrent drug coverage, because employers will drop the coverage when \nretirees become eligible for the new federal benefit, which is not as \ncomprehensive.\n  Democrats fought to include provisions in that flawed legislation to \nhelp employers maintain the good coverage that so many Americans depend \non to meet their needs in retirement. Sadly, some employers could abuse \nthese subsidies by failing to use them to assist their employees--and \nthe Bush Administration is letting them get away with it. Toothless \nenforcement and weak regulation allow some unscrupulous employers to \npocket the subsidy and weaken the coverage.\n  Senator Dayton's legislation will put an end to this scandalous \npractice by requiring employers to account for the funds they receive \nin subsidies. No longer will employers be able to hide that they are \naccepting subsidies to maintain retiree health coverage and still cut \nback the coverage. The Dayton bill also requires new research on ways \nto help employers maintain retiree coverage.\n  One of the most troubling aspects of the 2003 Act is that it \nvictimizes six million senior citizens and disabled people on \nMedicaid--the poorest of the poor. Their out-of-pocket payments for \ndrugs will be raised, even though they do not even have coverage for \nthe drugs they need the most.\n  Today, under Federal law, people with drug coverage under Medicaid \nmay be charged only nominal amounts for the drugs they need. The vast \nmajority of states charge nothing.\n  For every other Medicare benefit, Medicaid wraps around Medicare \ncoverage and picks up the out-of-pocket costs that Medicare does not \npay. Not under this legislation. States are prohibited from wrapping \naround the Medicare benefits with their Medicaid program. Instead, a \nuniform Federal co-payment is imposed. It is indexed, so that it \nincreases every year. If low income seniors need a drug that is not in \nthe insurance company formulary, they have to go through a burdensome \nappeals process. Most will simply go without the drug they need.\n  The people we are talking about are truly the poorest of the poor. In \nmost cases, their incomes are well below poverty. And the impact of \neven small\n\n[[Page S210]]\n\nco-payments is devastating. Study after study finds that when the poor \nhave to pay more for drugs, they end up hospitalized, in nursing homes, \nor dead.\n  Senator Dayton's legislation reverses this cruel provision and allows \nStates to delay implementing the requirement that the new Medicare \nprovisions must immediately supplant State Medicaid programs for the \npoorest of the poor.\n  Congress should be helping seniors with the burden of high drug \ncosts, not allowing a right wing agenda to destroy the guarantee of \naffordable health care that America's seniors deserve and expect.\n  That's why Senator Dayton and Senator Reid have introduced this \nneeded legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CONRAD (for himself, Mr. Reid, Mr. Feingold, Ms. Mikulski, \n        Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Salazar, Mr. \n        Rockefeller, Mr. Schumer, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Dayton, Mr. Dodd, \n        and Mrs. Clinton):\n  S. 19.

Accuracy of contraceptive information.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) Although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n     (referred to in this section as the ``CDC'') included family \n     planning in its published list of the Ten Great Public Health \n     Achievements in the 20th Century, the United States still has \n     one of the highest rates of unintended pregnancies among \n     industrialized nations.\n       (2) Each year, 3,000,000 pregnancies, nearly half of all \n     pregnancies, in the United States are unintended, and nearly \n     half of unintended pregnancies end in abortion.\n       (3) In 2002, 34,000,000 women-half of all women of \n     reproductive age (ages 15-44)-were in need of contraceptive \n     services and supplies to help prevent unintended pregnancy, \n     and half of those were in need of public support for such \n     care.\n       (4) The United States also has the highest rate of \n     infection with sexually transmitted diseases of any \n     industrialized country. In 2003 there were approximately \n     19,000,000 new cases of sexually transmitted diseases. \n     According to the CDC (November 2004), these sexually \n     transmitted diseases impose a tremendous economic burden with \n     direct medical costs as high as $15,500,000,000 per year.\n\n[[Page S211]]\n\n       (5) Increasing access to family planning services will \n     improve women's health and reduce the rates of unintended \n     pregnancy, abortion, and infection with sexually transmitted \n     diseases. Contraceptive use saves public health dollars. \n     Every dollar spent on providing family planning services \n     saves an estimated $3 in expenditures for pregnancy-related \n     and newborn care for Medicaid alone.\n       (6) Contraception is basic health care that improves the \n     health of women and children by enabling women to plan and \n     space births.\n       (7) Women experiencing unintended pregnancy are at greater \n     risk for physical abuse and women having closely spaced \n     births are at greater risk of maternal death.\n       (8) The child born from an unintended pregnancy is at \n     greater risk of low birth weight, dying in the first year of \n     life, being abused, and not receiving sufficient resources \n     for healthy development.\n       (9) The ability to control fertility also allows couples to \n     achieve economic stability by facilitating greater \n     educational achievement and participation in the workforce.\n       (10) The average American woman desires two children and \n     spends five years of her life pregnant or trying to get \n     pregnant and roughly 30 years trying to prevent pregnancy. \n     Without contraception, a sexually active woman has an 85 \n     percent chance of becoming pregnant within a year.\n       (11) The percentage of sexually active women ages 15 \n     through 44 who were not using contraception increased from \n     5.4 percent to 7.4 percent in 2002, an increase of 37 \n     percent, according to the CDC. This represents an apparent \n     increase of 1,430,000 women and could raise the rate of \n     unintended pregnancy.\n       (12) Many poor and low-income women cannot afford to \n     purchase contraceptive services and supplies on their own. \n     12,100,000 or 20 percent of all women ages 15 through 24 were \n     uninsured in 2002, and that proportion has increased by 10 \n     percent since 1999.\n       (13) Public health programs like Medicaid and title X (of \n     the Public Health Service Act), the national family planning \n     program, provide high-quality family planning services and \n     other preventive health care to underinsured or uninsured \n     individuals who may otherwise lack access to health care.\n       (14) Medicaid is the single largest source of public \n     funding for family planning services and HIV/AIDS care in the \n     United States. Half of all public dollars spent on \n     contraceptive services and supplies in the United States are \n     provided through Medicaid and approximately 5,500,000 women \n     of reproductive age-nearly one in 10 women between the ages \n     of 15 and 44-rely on Medicaid for their basic health care \n     needs.\n       (15) Each year, title X services enable Americans to \n     prevent approximately 1,000,000 unintended pregnancies, and \n     one in three women of reproductive age who obtains testing or \n     treatment for sexually transmitted diseases does so at a \n     title X-funded clinic. In 2003, title X-funded clinics \n     provided 2,800,000 Pap tests, 5,100,000 sexually transmitted \n     disease tests, and 526,000 HIV tests.\n       (16) The increasing number of uninsured, stagnant funding, \n     health care inflation, new and expensive contraceptive \n     technologies, and improved but expensive screening and \n     treatment for cervical cancer and sexually transmitted \n     diseases, have diminished the ability of title X funded \n     clinics to adequately serve all those in need. Taking \n     inflation into account, funding for the title X program \n     declined by 58 percent between 1980 and 2003.\n       (17) While Medicaid remains the largest source of \n     subsidized family planning services, States are facing \n     significant budgetary pressures to cut their Medicaid \n     programs, putting many women at risk of losing coverage for \n     family planning services.\n       (18) In addition, eligibility for Medicaid in many States \n     is severely restricted leaving family planning services \n     financially out of reach for many poor women. Many States \n     have demonstrated tremendous success with Medicaid family \n     planning waivers that allow them to expand access to Medicaid \n     family planning services. However, the administrative burden \n     of applying for a waiver poses a significant barrier to \n     States that would like to expand their coverage of family \n     planning programs through Medicaid.\n       (19) As of January of 2005, 21 States offered expanded \n     family planning benefits as a result of Medicaid family \n     planning waivers. The cost-effectiveness of these waivers was \n     affirmed by a recent evaluation funded by the Centers for \n     Medicare & Medicaid. This evaluation of six waivers found \n     that all such programs resulted in significant savings to \n     both the Federal and State governments. Moreover, the \n     researchers found measurable reductions in unintended \n     pregnancy.\n       (20) Although employer-sponsored health plans have improved \n     coverage of contraceptive services and supplies, largely in \n     response to State contraceptive coverage laws, there is still \n     significant room for improvement. The ongoing lack of \n     coverage in health insurance plans, particularly in self-\n     insured and individual plans, continues to place effective \n     forms of contraception beyond the financial reach of many \n     women.\n       (21) Including contraceptive coverage in private health \n     care plans saves employers money. Not covering contraceptives \n     in employee health plans costs employers 15 to 17 percent \n     more than providing such coverage.\n       (22) Approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration, \n     emergency contraception is a safe and effective way to \n     prevent unintended pregnancy after unprotected sex. It is \n     estimated that the use of emergency contraception could cut \n     the number of unintended pregnancies in half, thereby \n     reducing the need for abortion. New research confirms that \n     easier access to emergency contraceptives does not increase \n     sexual risk-taking or sexually transmitted diseases.\n       (23) In 2000, 51,000 abortions were prevented by the use of \n     emergency contraception. Increased use of emergency \n     contraception accounted for up to 43 percent of the total \n     decline in abortions between 1994 and 2000.\n       (24) A February 2004 CDC study of declining birth and \n     pregnancy rates among teens concluded that the reduction in \n     teen pregnancy between 1991 and 2001 suggests that increased \n     abstinence and increased use of contraceptives were equally \n     responsible for the decline. As such, it is critically \n     important that teens receive accurate, unbiased information \n     about contraception.\n       (25) Thirteen percent of all teens give birth before age \n     20. 88 percent of births to teens age 17 or younger were \n     unintended. 24 percent of Hispanic females gave birth before \n     the age of 20. (CDC, December 2004).\n       (26) The American Medical Association, the American Nurses \n     Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American \n     College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American \n     Public Health Association, and the Society for Adolescent \n     Medicine, support responsible sexuality education that \n     includes information about both abstinence and contraception.\n       (27) Teens who receive sex education that includes \n     discussion of contraception are more likely than those who \n     receive abstinence-only messages to delay sex and to have \n     fewer partners and use contraceptives when they do become \n     sexually active.\n       (28) Government-funded abstinence only programs are \n     precluded from discussing contraception except to talk about \n     failure rates. A December 2004 review of federally-funded \n     abstinence-only programs by the United States House of \n     Representatives Committee on Government Reform (Minority \n     Staff) found that many federally funded abstinence-only \n     program curricula distort public health data and misrepresent \n     the effectiveness of contraception. Information on the \n     effectiveness of condoms, in preventing pregnancy and \n     sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV, was often \n     highly inaccurate.\n\n             TITLE I--TITLE X OF PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT\n\n     SEC. 101.

A bill to establish an emergency reserve fund to provide \ntimely financial assistance in response to domestic disasters and \nemergencies; to the Committee on the Budget.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, over the past decade, Congress has \napproved over $46 billion in disaster relief and emergency spending. \nThis is an average of $4.6 billion a year. The majority of this \nfunding--$34 billion--has been provided through supplemental bills, not \nsubject to the normal appropriations process.\n  Supporters of supplemental spending suggest it provides Congress \nflexibility to respond to emergencies and to priorities that did not \nreceive the proper consideration during the budget cycle. While \nsupplemental bills do offer flexibility, they are not always helpful \nfor fiscal responsibility. Millions of dollars are put in emergency \nspending bills that should go through the regular budget process, \nadding more and more to the bottom line.\n  America is at a critical time--we must be prepared to address \ndomestic emergencies without increasing the deficit or being forced to \nfund non-emergency projects in order to release necessary funds. \nSupplemental spending circumvents budgetary enforcement mechanisms and \ncan lead lawmakers to under-fund programs in the regular appropriations \nprocess, because they know they ultimately can get what is needed \nthrough a supplemental.\n  Supplemental bills allocate funding for emergencies, and we have all \nwitnessed, firsthand, how a natural disaster can impact a country \nseverely. Merely because something is unforeseen does not mean we \nshould not prepare. Congress needs to plan in a manner that is fiscally \nresponsible and procedurally transparent.\n  Today, I offer a bill to create an emergency fund under the office of \nthe Secretary of the Treasury, in an interest bearing account, \ncontaining 1.2 percent of the annual non-defense domestic spending, or \nroughly $4.6 billion. This will be America's rainy day fund--a savings \naccount ready for almost any potential unforeseen domestic emergencies.\n  This account is not designed to eliminate the need for supplemental \nbills but rather lessen the need for them.\n  Last year, in supplemental spending alone, Congress spent $2.5 \nbillion on disaster relief in America. Domestic discretionary \nsupplemental bills enacted in response to natural disasters, such as \nhurricanes and earthquakes, rose steadily through the 1990s. Federal \nEmergency Management Agency, FEMA, was the second-largest recipient of \nsupplemental spending during the 1990s. Supplemental appropriations for \n``non-natural'' disasters such as the Los Angeles riots in 1992 and the \nOklahoma City bombing in 1995 as well as the September 11 terrorist \nattack have also demanded quick and efficient funding. History is \nteaching us a lesson; while we do not know what the\n\n[[Page S215]]\n\nemergencies will be, we can feel certain there will be something to \nwhich we will need to respond.\n  Beyond the clear fiscal conservatism we need, I believe this rainy \nday fund would reduce the time it takes to respond to emergencies by \ngiving Congress a more efficient, less political process. My bill would \nrequire the contingency fund to be expended before supplemental \nspending for domestic disasters can be pursued, with the exclusion of \ndefense spending.\n  As we seek to be more fiscally responsible, our next step forward \nshould be this account, from which the funds we draw upon are planned \nfor and set aside through the normal appropriations process. Our \ncurrent system regularly underfunds FEMA and other agencies for \nemergencies, and this should end.\n  As we prepare for the future, it is my goal that we save and prepare \nfor the vital needs of our people should there be a domestic emergency. \nRecent events worldwide demand we be fiscally responsible and \nprocedurally capable of this, our most important duty, the protection \nand safe-keeping of the American people.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CHAMBLISS:\n  S. 25. A bill to promote freedom, fairness, and economic opportunity \nby repealing the income tax and other taxes, abolishing the Internal \nRevenue Service, and enacting a national sales tax to be administered \nprimarily by the States; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Fair Tax \nAct of 2005. This bill will promote freedom, fairness, and economic \nopportunity by repealing the Federal income tax and other taxes, \nabolishing the Internal Revenue Service, and enacting a national sales \ntax.\n  The Fair Tax, which offers a national sales tax as the primary source \nof Federal revenue, is a necessary piece of tax reform that, should it \npass, upon its inception would eliminate our current archaic and \ninefficient Tax Code and replace it with a simpler, fairer means of \ncollecting revenue.\n  Our antiquated Tax Code was implemented in 1913 and has since been \nmodified numerous times. The Federal Tax Code in its present form is \noverly complicated and desperately in need of an overhaul. We are well \nbeyond rectifying the unfairness in our current system by tinkering \naround the edges. All Americans are in dire need of unbiased, sweeping \ntax reform--and the Fair Tax provides just that.\n  The Fair Tax Act of 2005 would repeal the individual income tax, the \ncorporate income tax, capital gains taxes, all payroll taxes, the self-\nemployment tax and the estate and gift taxes in lieu of a 23 percent \ntax on the final sale of all goods and services. Elimination of these \ninefficient taxing mechanisms will not only bring about equality within \nin our tax system, it will also bring about simplicity.\n  This bill will also provide for tax relief for business-to-business \ntransactions. These transactions, including used-product transactions \nwhich have already been taxed, are not subject to the sales tax, \nthereby abrogating any double taxation.\n  Social Security and Medicare benefits would remain untouched under \nthe Fair Tax bill. There would be no financial reductions to either one \nof these vital programs. Instead, the source of the trust-fund revenue \nfor these two programs would be replaced simply by sales-tax revenue \ninstead of payroll-tax revenue.\n  Lastly, under the Fair Tax Act, every American would receive a \nmonthly rebate check equal to spending up to the Federal poverty level \naccording to the Department of Health and Human Services guidelines. \nThis rebate would ensure that no American pays taxes on the purchase of \nnecessities.\n  The Fair Tax creates a fairer, simpler code that allows every \nAmerican the freedom to determine his or her own priorities and \nopportunities. Ronald Reagan once said, ``I believe we really can, \nhowever, say that God did give mankind virtually unlimited gifts to \ninvent, produce and create. And for that reason alone, it would be \nwrong for governments to devise a tax structure or economic system that \nsuppresses and denies those gifts.'' I couldn't agree more.\n  And as long as we continue to operate under our current skewed Tax \nCode, we will continue to suppress and deny these unlimited gifts to \nthe American people, who would otherwise thrive boundlessly under the \nFair Tax.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. HUTCHISON (for herself, Mr. Frist, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. \n        Ensign, Mr. Alexander, and Mr. Cornyn):\n  S. 27. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to make \npermanent the deduction of State and local general sales taxes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce a bill to \npermanently correct an injustice in the tax code that has harmed \ncitizens in many States of this great Nation.\n  State and local governments have various alternatives for raising \nrevenue. Some levy income taxes, some use sales taxes, and others use a \ncombination of the two. The citizens who pay State and local income \ntaxes have been able to offset some of what they pay by receiving a \ndeduction on their federal taxes. Before 1986, taxpayers also had the \nability to deduct their sales taxes.\n  The philosophy behind these deductions is simple: people should not \nhave to pay taxes on their taxes. The money that people must give to \none level of government should not also be taxed by another level of \ngovernment.\n  Unfortunately, citizens of some States were treated differently after \n1986 when the deduction for State and local sales taxes was eliminated. \nThis discriminated against those living in States, such as my home \nState of Texas, with no income taxes. It is important to remember the \nlack of an income tax does not mean citizens in these States do not pay \nState taxes; revenues are simply collected differently.\n  It is unfair to give citizens from some States a deduction for the \nrevenue they provide their State and local governments, while not doing \nthe same for citizens from other States. Federal tax law should not \ntreat people differently on the basis of State residence and differing \ntax collection methods, and it should not provide an incentive for \nStates to establish income taxes over sales taxes.\n  This discrepancy had a significant impact on Texas. According to the \nTexas Comptroller, the ability of taxpayers to deduct their sales taxes \nwill lead to an additional $740 million staying in the hands of Texans \neach year, the creation of more than 16,500 new jobs, and the addition \nof $920 million in State economic activity.\n  Last year, we took an important step by reinstating a sales tax \ndeduction. As a result, everyone now has the opportunity to deduct \neither their State and local income taxes or sales taxes. For the 55 \nmillion of us in the 7 States with a sales tax but no income tax, this \nmeans the tax code no longer discriminates against us. Unfortunately, \nthe new deduction is only in effect for 2004 and 2005. We must act to \nprevent the inequity from returning.\n  The legislation I am offering today will fix this problem for good by \nmaking the State and local sales tax deduction permanent. This will \npermanently end the discrimination suffered by my fellow Texans and \ncitizens of other States who do not have the option of an income tax \ndeduction.\n  This legislation is about reestablishing equity to the tax code and \ndefending the important principle of eliminating taxes on taxes. I hope \nmy fellow Senators will support this effort.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the test of the bill be printed in the \nRecord. \n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, today I am joining my good friend the \nSenator from Texas, (Mrs. Hutchison), and the Senator from Tennessee, \nthe Majority Leader, Mr. Frist, in legislation to permanently extend \nthe State sales tax deduction. This bill aims to make permanent \nlegislation that the Congress passed and the President signed into law \nlast year on October 22, 2004 as a provision of the JOBS Act. It is a \nchange to the tax code that I have worked to see enacted since coming \nto the U.S. Senate, and one I want to maintain.\n  The JOBS Act reinstituted, for a period of 2 years, the ability of \ntaxpayers to deduct State and local sales taxes just as they would \nState and local income taxes. Residents of States such as Washington \nthat do not have income\n\n[[Page S216]]\n\ntaxes, but have State sales taxes, had not been able to do this since \nthe 1986.\n  Make no mistake about it: permanently extending the sales tax \ndeduction is a tax cut for Washington State taxpayers. Such a cut will \nstrengthen our economy and fundamentally restore basic tax fairness.\n  When the Federal income tax was first imposed in 1913, Congress \nallowed taxpayers to deduct State and local sales so they would not be \ntaxed on once at the State level and then, again, at the Federal level \nin the same calendar year.\n  In 1986, after 74 years of precedent, this tax equity abruptly ended. \nTaxpayers from States without income taxes were given a raw deal when \nCongress made a budgetary squeeze play and ended the tax deduction for \nState sales taxes.\n  For States like Washington, where sales tax revenues are nearly 60 \npercent of the State budget, the impact is immense. The loss to \nWashington State taxpayers in 2004 alone, is estimated to be $500 \nmillion.\n  Washington taxpayers waited 18 years to for the Federal government to \ncorrect the unique burden on them that amounts to requiring them to pay \ntaxes twice on the same money. Now that the burden has been lifted for \n2 years, with thanks to this body and the President, Washington \ntaxpayers are now looking for--and must have--permanence in the tax \ncode with regard to their ability to deduct State and local sales taxes \nfrom their Federal income tax.\n  As I mentioned, this issue has been a primary one for me on behalf of \nthe people I serve. In fact, when I became a member of this body in the \n107th Congress, one of my first legislative acts was to cosponsor sales \ntax deduction legislation that at the time was introduced by the former \nSenator from Tennessee, Mr. Thompson. In the 108th Congress, Senator \nHutchison and I carried the banner as the lead sponsors of similar \nlegislation, the core of which we saw enacted into law for a 2-year \nperiod.\n  I am here once again in the 109th Congress with the Senator from \nTexas, Mrs. Hutchison, on the heels of a victory for a two-year \nreprieve for our constituents, looking, now, for permanent equity in \nthe tax code. I look forward to continuing to work with Senator \nHutchison, as well as Senator Frist and others, in moving this sales \ntax deduction legislation forward in the coming months.\n  Only by making the two-year law permanent will we be able to see to \nit that taxpayers from Washington State, or any other State, are not \nunfairly singled out to pay higher taxes.\n  I urge prompt action on this measure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 29. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to limit the \nmisuse of social security numbers, to establish criminal penalties for \nsuch misuse, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEN. Mr. President, I rise on behalf of myself and Senator \nLeahy to again introduce legislation to protect one of Americans' most \nvaluable but vulnerable assets: Social Security numbers. This is the \nsecond Congress in a row that I have introduced this legislation, to \nrestrict the sale and display of Social Security numbers.\n  We have just begun the New Year, and unfortunately we can say with \ncertainty that it will be another year in which millions of Americans \nwill be victimized by identity theft, a crime so often linked to \nunprotected Social Security numbers. It is my hope that Congress will \nfinally approve this legislation this year. For the benefit of all \nCalifornians and of all Americans, the Senate needs to take this step, \nto stop those who would do us harm by taking our very identities.\n  The goal of this bill is straightforward--to get Social Security \nnumbers out of the public domain, so that identity thieves can't get \nthem. Toward this goal, this bill will do the following:\n  The heart of this bill prohibits anyone from selling or displaying an \nindividual's Social Security number to the general public without the \nindividual's express consent.\n  But in recognition that sometimes there are legitimate needs for \nSocial Security numbers, the bill also makes exceptions. Perhaps the \nmost important exception allows the sale of Social Security numbers \nbetween businesses, or between the government and businesses. The bill \nalso makes exceptions for law enforcement, national security, \ncompliance with other laws, and a few other areas.\n  Additionally, this bill prohibits government entities from displaying \nSocial Security numbers on public records that are posted on the \nInternet or in other electronic media after the legislation's effective \ndate. It also prohibits governments from printing Social Security \nnumbers on government checks.\n  This bill also punishes people who fraudulently use Social Security \nnumbers to obtain benefits that they do not deserve.\n  Finally, this law has teeth to enforce its provisions. It gives the \nAttorney General the authority to issue civil penalties of up to $5,000 \nfor people who misuse Social Security numbers. It also creates a \ncriminal penalty, of up to five years in prison, for anyone who obtains \nanother person's Social Security number for the purpose of locating or \nidentifying that individual with the intent to physically harm that \nperson. And it lets the victims of identity theft sue in court to \nrecover their loss from the person who causes it.\n  Mr. President, the need for this bill should be clear. Theft of a \nSocial Security number can be especially devastating, because that \npiece of information has become a de facto universal identifier in \nAmerican society.\n  Despite the widespread use of Social Security numbers, the General \nAccounting Office reported recently that ``No single federal law \nregulates the overall use or restricts the disclosure of SSNs by \ngovernments.'' (Source: Social Security numbers: SSNs are Widely Used \nby Government and Could be Better Protected, 2002 (Report Number GAO-\n02-691T) at page 5). As a result, the use of Social Security numbers is \nregulated by an inconsistent and insufficient patchwork of state and \nfederal laws, that often leaves the numbers in plain view of the whole \nworld.\n  One recent book on privacy in the United States documents how far the \nuse of Social Security numbers has spread beyond its original purpose, \nwhen they were created in 1936, of tracking American workers' earnings \nand benefits. According to the book: ``The SSN began to be used for \nmilitary personnel, legally admitted aliens, anyone receiving or \napplying for federal benefits, food stamps, school lunch program \neligibility, draft registration, and federal loans. State and local \ngovernments, as well as private sector entities such as schools and \nbanks, began to use SSNs as well--for drivers' licenses, birth \ncertificates, blood donation, jury selection, worker's compensation, \noccupational licenses, and marriage licenses.'' (Source: Daniel Solove \nand Marc Rotenberg, Information Privacy Law, Aspen Publishers, 2003, at \npage 447-48.)\n  It isn't surprising, then, that the sale of Social Security numbers \nis proceeding at a furious pace. According to the GAO in a report that \nit released earlier this year, ``Internet-based information resellers \nwhose Web sites we accessed also obtain SSNs from their customers and \nscour public records and other publicly available information to \nprovide the information to persons willing to pay a fee.'' (Source: \nSocial Security numbers: Private Sector Entities Routinely Obtain and \nUse SSNs, and Laws Limit the Disclosure of this Information (2004, \nReport Number GAO-04-11, on Highlights Page).\n  Governments also play a role in the widespread availability of Social \nSecurity numbers to the general public. According to another GAO \nreport, issued just the other month in November 2004, ``State agencies \nin 41 States and the District of Columbia reported visible SSNs in at \nleast one type of record.'' (Source: Government Could Do More to Reduce \nDisplay in Public Records and on Identity Cards, (November 2004, Report \nNumber GAO-05-59, on Highlights Page). This affects about 94 percent of \nthe country's population. The report continues that ``15 to 28 percent \nof the nation's 3,141 counties do place [Social Security numbers] on \nthe Internet and this could affect millions of people.''\n  If anyone who has doubts about the important role that this \nlegislation will in protecting the identity of Americans, let me offer \na few facts.\n\n[[Page S217]]\n\n  For the past four years, the Federal Trade Commission has ranked \nidentity theft as its top consumer complaint. When the new numbers for \n2004 come out in early February, I will not be surprised if identity \ntheft again ranks as the most common complaint.\n  The most comprehensive survey of identity-theft victimization, a \nFederal Trade Commission report released in 2003, found that nearly 10 \nmillion Americans had been victimized by identity theft in the previous \nyear. The California Office of Privacy Protection estimates that 1.1 \nmillion of those victims were Californians.\n  A separate FTC report found California to have the third-highest rate \nof identity theft per capita in 2003, with the number of victims \nincreasing by more than 28 percent from 2002.\n\n  For anyone still unconvinced about the need for this law, let me \noffer a few specific examples of identity theft.\n  In November, 2004, in my home state of California, a married couple--\nAntonio and Rose Espino--pled guilty after stealing the identities of \nover 1,000 victims, and also stealing more than $8.8 million in \nfraudulent unemployment insurance. They obtained employer payroll lists \nthat included names and Social Security numbers. (Source: ``San Joaquin \ncouple plead guilty in identity-theft case,'' Fresno Bee, November 23, \n2004).\n  In another case, Christopher Jones, a twenty-five-year-old employee \nat the University of North Carolina-Pembroke, stole approximately 3,000 \nSocial Security numbers through his job, handing out towels and other \nequipment at the university gym, and then tried to sell them in blocks \nof 1,000 on eBay. He stated in his advertisement: ``100 (one hundred \nSocial Security # Numbers Obtain False Credit Cards Idenity Theft I \nDon't Care Bid Starts at a Dollar a Piece USPS Money Orders only all \nDifferent.''\n  Similar behavior--using the Web to gather Social Secuirty numbers--\nstill continues. As The Washington Post reported last February, by \nusing the common search engine Google on the Web, ``Search strings . . \n. often bring up spread sheets, credit card numbers, and Social \nSecurity numbers linked to a customer list.'' (Source: ``Online Search \nEngines Help Lift Cover of Privacy,'' The Washington Post, February 9, \n2004, at A1).\n  I personally first became aware of the need for a law to restrict the \nsale and display of Social Security numbers about eight years ago, when \none of my staff members sat me down and downloaded my own Social \nSecurity Number from the Internet in a matter of minutes.\n  Unfortunately, Congress has done little to protect Social Security \nnumbers since then. We still badly need a uniform law. Year after year, \nI have advocated and proposed such legislation that would restrict the \npublic display and use of Social Security numbers:\n  In the 106th Congress, I introduced S. 2966.\n  In the 107th Congress, I introduced, S. 848 and S. 3100.\n  In the 108th Congress, I introduced S. 228, S. 745, and S. 2801.\n  None of these bills moved. Today, I stand before you yet again, to \nintroduce for a seventh time a bill to take steps that will make it \nmore difficult for thieves to steal this precious resource. This issue \ndoes not concern Republican government or Democratic government; this \nis an issue of good government.\n  Last year, the President signed into law a bill that I helped to \nauthor, to increase penalties for those who steal the identities of \nothers. But punishment is not enough. We need to stop identity theft \nfrom occurring in the first place. This information should have been \nunder lock and key long ago. It is time for us to act. Thank you Mr. \nPresident.\n  I ask for unanimous consent that the text of the legislation directly \nfollow this statement in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 29\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The inappropriate display, sale, or purchase of social \n     security numbers has contributed to a growing range of \n     illegal activities, including fraud, identity theft, and, in \n     some cases, stalking and other violent crimes.\n       (2) While financial institutions, health care providers, \n     and other entities have often used social security numbers to \n     confirm the identity of an individual, the general display to \n     the public, sale, or purchase of these numbers has been used \n     to commit crimes, and also can result in serious invasions of \n     individual privacy.\n       (3) The Federal Government requires virtually every \n     individual in the United States to obtain and maintain a \n     social security number in order to pay taxes, to qualify for \n     social security benefits, or to seek employment. An \n     unintended consequence of these requirements is that social \n     security numbers have become one of the tools that can be \n     used to facilitate crime, fraud, and invasions of the privacy \n     of the individuals to whom the numbers are assigned. Because \n     the Federal Government created and maintains this system, and \n     because the Federal Government does not permit individuals to \n     exempt themselves from those requirements, it is appropriate \n     for the Federal Government to take steps to stem the abuse of \n     social security numbers.\n       (4) The display, sale, or purchase of social security \n     numbers in no way facilitates uninhibited, robust, and wide-\n     open public debate, and restrictions on such display, sale, \n     or purchase would not affect public debate.\n       (5) No one should seek to profit from the display, sale, or \n     purchase of social security numbers in circumstances that \n     create a substantial risk of physical, emotional, or \n     financial harm to the individuals to whom those numbers are \n     assigned.\n       (6) Consequently, this Act provides each individual that \n     has been assigned a social security number some degree of \n     protection from the display, sale, and purchase of that \n     number in any circumstance that might facilitate unlawful \n     conduct.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Electronic Fund Transfer Act to extend \ncertain consumer protections to international remittance transfers of \nfunds originating in the United States, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I am introducing the International \nRemittance Consumer Protection Act of 2005. This legislation extends \nbasic consumer protection rights to those who send remittances, and it \ncreates new avenues and incentives for federally insured financial \ninstitutions to provide remittance and basic banking services to those \nwho currently do not use such institutions to send remittances.\n  The practice of sending remittances is not new. Immigrants to the \nUnited States traditionally have used remittances to provide financial \nassistance to family members who remained in their country of origin, \nbut the practice has been largely overlooked; it has not been \nsystematically studied and its implications have not been fully \nunderstood. The 2000 census shows that 30 million people in this \ncountry are foreign-born--the largest number in our Nation's history--\nand the vast majority of them--22 million are citizens or legal \nresidents. More than 40 percent of our Nation's foreign-born population \nimmigrated to the United States in the 1990s, and some 15.4 million, or \nmore than half the immigrant community, have come from Latin American \ncountries. Immigrants make a vital contribution to the economic and \nsocial life of our Nation.\n  In a recent study, Sending Money Home: Remittances to Latin America \nfrom the U.S., 2004, the Inter-American Development Bank, IADB, found \nthat nationwide over 60 percent of Latin American immigrants send \nremittances. On average, each immigrant sends $240 at a time, 12 times \nper year. Although these individual transactions are not large, they \nhave constituted an aggregate amount of over $30 billion from America \nto our Latin American neighbors in this year alone.\n  In my State of Maryland, we have 175,000 immigrants from Latin \nAmerica and the vast majority send remittances back home. According to \nthe IADB's study 80 percent of Maryland's immigrants from Latin America \nsend remittances. The typical sender remits an average of $245, 14 \ntimes per year--in other words, remittances are a monthly matter, with \nspecial gifts for Christmas and Mother's Day.\n  The subject of remittances has been a major interest of mine for some \ntime. As chairman of the Banking Committee, in February, 2002, during \nthe 107th Congress, I chaired what I understand was the first \nCongressional hearing devoted exclusively to the subject. Dr. Manuel \nOrozco, a leading researcher on remittances at the Inter-American \nDialogue, told the Committee that remittances from the U.S. to Latin \nAmerica had grown substantially--at that point to an estimated $20 \nbillion in 2001--and that between 15 to 20 percent--$3-$4 billion--was \nbeing lost in fees and other transaction costs. Since Dr. Orozco \ntestified, remittances to Latin America have grown by $10 billion, or \n50 percent, in just three years, and continued growth is expected.\n  That an estimated 15 percent to 20 percent of the money sent in \nremittances is diverted to fees and other transaction costs, often \nhidden from the remittance sender, is evidence of the abusive practices \nthat exist in the remittance market. There are two primary factors that \naccount for this abuse. First, studies have shown that people who send \nremittances tend to be relatively low-wage earners, with modest formal \neducation and relatively little experience in dealing with this \ncountry's complex system of financial institutions. As a result they \nare susceptible to unscrupulous actors who can take advantage of them \nby charging all sorts of exorbitant fees, which are often hidden or \nmisrepresented. The exchange rate conversion is often the mechanism for \nthis abusive practice.\n  Second, remittances are currently not subject to the requirements set \nby Federal consumer protection law, including the disclosure of fees. \nThere is no requirement that a remittance transfer provider disclose to \nthe consumer the exchange rate fee that will be applied in the \ntransaction. Without knowing the exchange rate fee that the company is \ncharging, a consumer has little ability to gauge accurately the full \ncost of sending a remittance. As Sergio Bendixen, a leading researcher \nof public opinion and behavior, with a specialty among Hispanic \nconsumers, testified before the Banking Committee: ``an overwhelming \nmajority of Hispanic immigrants are unaware that their families in \nLatin America receive less money than what they send from the United \nStates.'' Further, a remittance sender cannot effectively shop between \nremittance transfer providers. The lack of basic information limits the \namount of competition in this market.\n  The legislation I am introducing today extends basic consumer rights \nto those who send remittances. Further, by requiring clear and \nunderstandable disclosures to the remittance sender of the cost of the \nremittance, thus presenting to the consumer the full cost of sending \nmoney, the legislation will enhance competition, which in turn should \nlead to an overall decrease in the cost of sending remittances. As \nSergio Bendixen testified to the Banking Committee, ``Full disclosure \nshould unleash market forces that, hopefully, will result in a \nsignificant reduction in the cost of sending cash remittances.''\n\n  This legislation amends the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, EFTA, which \nis the primary vehicle for providing basic protections to most persons \nwho engage in electronic transactions, to cover remittances, and to \nprovide the basic rights associated with EFTA to remittance \ntransactions. The two most important components of EFTA are the \nrequirement of full disclosure of fees and the establishment of a \nprocess for the resolution of transactional errors. These rights have \nbeen an integral part of the regulations that govern our banking \ninfrastructure since EFTA's enactment in 1978. The new legislation will \nbuild upon the success of EFTA by extending these basic rights to \nremittance senders.\n  The cornerstone of this legislation is the requirement that \nremittance transfer providers make three key disclosures to their \nconsumers: One, the total cost of the remittance, represented in a \nsingle dollar amount; two, the total amount of currency that will be \nsent to the designated recipient; and three, the promised date of \ndelivery for the remittance. These disclosures follow the core \nrecommendations of the Inter-American Development Bank, which in its \npublication, Remittances to Latin America and the Caribbean: Goals and \nRecommendations,\n\n[[Page S222]]\n\nstates: ``Remittance institutions should disclose in a fully \ntransparent manner, complete information on total costs and transfer \nconditions, including all commissions and fees, foreign exchange rates \napplied and execution time.''\n  The total cost disclosure will include the cost of the exchange rate \nconversion as well as all up-front fees. This single item will both \ngive consumers a more accurate representation of the cost of the \nremittance transaction and allow consumers to more effectively compare \ncosts between remittance transfer providers.\n  In order to calculate the cost of the exchange rate conversion, which \nis part of the total cost, the legislation requires that the Treasury \nDepartment post on its website, on a daily basis, the exchange rate for \nall currencies. At present the Treasury receives this information on a \ndaily basis, but posts it only on a quarterly basis on the Treasury \nwebsite. By posting the information daily, the Treasury could create a \nuniform and credible source for exchange rate information.\n  To calculate the cost to the consumer of the exchange rate \ndifferential, remittance transfer providers will use the difference \nbetween the previous business day's exchange rate, as posted on the \nTreasury website, and the exchange rate that the remittance transfer \nprovider offers. Using the exchange rate posted by the Treasury will \nensure that the exchange rate cost is calculated on a uniform base. \nWhen the exchange rate cost is disclosed to the consumer as part of the \ntotal cost of the remittance transfer, the consumer will be better able \nto understand the full cost of the transaction and to shop between \ndifferent remittance transfer providers.\n  In addition to fee disclosure requirements, this legislation \nestablishes an error resolution mechanism so that consumers whose \nremittance transactions experience an error have a fair, open, and \nexpedient process through which they may resolve those errors with the \ninstitution that conducted the flawed transaction. This basic right is \nalready afforded to consumers who are protected by EFTA, and now this \nright will be extended to cover consumers who send remittances as well. \nFurther, the legislation establishes an error resolution mechanism for \nremittance transfer errors that is responsive to the different types of \nerrors that can occur in a remittance transaction and is reflective of \nthe unique characteristics of the remittance market and its \nparticipants.\n  Under this legislation, a consumer has one year from the date that \nthe remittance transfer company promised to deliver the money to notify \nthe company that an error has occurred. The company is then required to \nresolve the error within 90 days. To resolve the error, the company \nmust either 1. refund the full amount of the remittance that was not \nproperly transferred, 2. resend that amount at no additional cost to \nthe consumer or the designated recipient, or 3. demonstrate to the \nconsumer that there was no error. The Federal Reserve Board is also \ngranted the authority to establish additional remedies for specific \nsituations that cannot be addressed by the three specific remedies that \nare described in the legislation.\n  It is urgent that we continue to encourage efforts to bring those who \nsend remittances into the financial mainstream. In his testimony to the \nBanking Committee, Dr. Orozco pointed out that, ``About two-thirds of \nimmigrants cash their salary checks in check cashing stores that charge \nexorbitant fees. Many of these same immigrants then use what remains of \ntheir income to send remittances back home. In this common scenario, \nimmigrants are penalized in both receiving and sending their \nearnings.'' In order to further bank those who are currently unbanked, \nthe legislation that I am introducing today requires that the Federal \nbanking agencies and the National Credit Union Administration provide \nguidelines to financial institutions regarding the offering of low-cost \nremittance transfers and no-cost or low-cost basic consumer accounts. \nThis legislation also amends the Federal Credit Union Act to allow \ncredit unions to offer remittances and to cash checks for persons who \nare in their field of membership but are not credit union members. The \nguidelines set out in the legislation will help educate the financial \nservices industry about the importance and potential profitability of \nproviding these services.\n\n  The sending of remittances in a fair and scrupulous manner is likely \nto be profitable for the institution that provides the remittance \nservice, and indeed we have begun to see aggressive moves into the \nremittance market by many of the largest banking institutions. \nIndividuals who send remittances but are currently unbanked represent \nan expanded and profitable customer base for financial institutions.\n  By its very nature, the issues involved in sending remittances affect \nboth the United States and other nations. As Professor Susan Martin of \nGeorgetown University, who also testified at our hearing, told the \nBanking Committee: ``Until relatively recently, researchers and policy \nmakers tended to dismiss the importance of remittances or emphasize \nonly their negative aspects . . . but recent work on remittances show a \nfar more complex and promising picture. . . . Experts now recognize \nthat remittances have far greater positive impact on communities in \ndeveloping countries than previously acknowledged.'' In fact, the size \nof the remittance market is such that for six Central American and \nCaribbean nations--Nicaragua, Haiti, El Salvador, Honduras, Guyana and \nJamaica--remittances constitute more than 10 percent of GDP; Haiti and \nJamaica receive more in remittances than in revenues from trade. The \nWorld Bank estimates that Mexico receives more in remittances than it \ndoes in foreign direct investment. Reducing the costs of remittances is \nin the interest of both the United States and the countries that \nreceive them.\n  Given the growing importance of annual remittance flows, we must work \nto increase their efficiency. One mechanism for accomplishing this \nobjective, and for increasing the ability of financial institutions to \noffer remittances, is linking our banking infrastructure with the \nbanking infrastructures of other nations. The Federal Reserve operates \nan international automated clearing house system, ACHi, that is \ncurrently linked to seven countries, of which the vast majority are \nhighly developed trading partners that receive relatively low levels of \nremittances. The ACHi was recently connected to Mexico, however, which \nwill allow financial institutions throughout the United States, \nespecially those institutions of smaller size, to provide remittance \nservices more easily and cheaply to Mexico. This legislation directs \nthe Fed to take into account the importance of remittance flows to \nother countries as it continues to expand the ACHi system. Linking the \nACHi to countries that receive significant remittances has the \npotential to result in great benefits to consumers who send remittances \nfrom America as well as to those who receive the remittances around the \nworld.\n  Finally, I am acutely aware of the need for better and more broadly \navailable financial literacy and education for all Americans. I am \npleased to report that in the last Congress, as part of the \nreauthorization of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, we established a \nPresidential Financial Literacy and Education Commission, which is \ncharged with developing a national strategy to promote financial \nliteracy and education. The Act addresses the issue of remittances by \nincluding in the Commission's work a focus on increasing the \n``awareness of the particular financial needs and financial \ntransactions, such as the sending of remittances, of consumers who are \ntargeted in multilingual financial literacy and education programs.'' \nThe legislation that I am introducing today builds on that framework by \ninstructing the bank and credit union regulators to work with the \nCommission to specifically increase the financial education efforts \nthat target those persons who send remittances.\n  Millions of Americans send remittances to family members around the \nworld, for a total far exceeding the $30 billion that goes to Latin \nAmerica alone. Yet almost all of these transactions take place without \nthe basic consumer rights and protections that apply to other \nelectronic transfers. Consumers who send remittances are often \nimmigrants and workers who earn modest wages, who are not aware of the \nfull costs of each remittance,\n\n[[Page S223]]\n\nand as a practical matter have no way of finding out, and, as a \nconsequence, in the aggregate pay billions of dollars in costs and \nhidden fees. They do not have available to them an established \nprocedure for resolving transactional errors. This legislation \nrectifies this situation by extending to remittances the basic consumer \nrights established in EFTA. The bill also contains provisions that, \nwhen implemented, will allow more insured financial institutions to \nprovide remittance services--and potentially at lower costs to \nconsumers. The bill contains important provisions to help bring the \nunbanked--men and women without an account at a bank or credit union \ninto the financial mainstream. Taken together, these measures will \nincrease transparency, competition and efficiency in the remittance \nmarket, while helping to bring more Americans into the financial \nmainstream.\n  A broad range of community, civil rights, and consumer groups have \nendorsed this legislation including the National Council of La Raza, \nthe Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, the League of \nUnited Latin American Citizens, the Leadership Conference on Civil \nRights, United Farm Workers of America, the Farmworker Justice Fund, \nthe NAACP, Casa de Maryland, the National Federation of Filipino \nAmerican Associations, the Asian Pacific American Labor Alliance, \nNational Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium, Consumers Union, \nConsumer Federation of America, the National Consumer Law Center, the \nNational Community Reinvestment Coalition, the Center for Responsible \nLending, U.S. PIRG, ACORN, Woodstock Institute, and the National \nAssociation of Consumer Advocates. The Credit Union National \nAssociation and the World Council of Credit Unions, both of whom \nprovide remittance services, have also endorsed this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of International Remittance \nConsumer Protection Act be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 31\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to prohibit energy market manipulation; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Electricity \nNeeds Rules and Oversight Now, or ENRON, Act.\n  This legislation does two simple--yet critical--things. The ENRON Act \nwould amend the Federal Power Act to put in place a broad prohibition \non all manipulative practices in electricity markets--rather than just \nround-trip trading, as included in last year's comprehensive energy \nbill; and it would specify that electricity rates resulting from \nmanipulative practices are not just and reasonable under the Federal \nPower Act.\n  Many of my colleagues are, by now, familiar with the provisions of \nthis legislation, as I have often described the circumstances that led \nme to propose it. While the Senate has been considering comprehensive \nenergy legislation over the past few years, various investigations have \nunearthed Enron's ``smoking gun'' memos--detailing the company's \nschemes to drive up electricity prices--and other evidence leading the \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to conclude that market \nmanipulation was ``epidemic'' in western markets during 2000-2001. \nRecently, even more information--including audio files detailing Enron \ntraders' conversations--has come to light. Meanwhile, the energy crisis \ncontinues to take a serious toll on American consumers and businesses: \nit's been estimated that, as a result, the West has lost $35 billion in \ndomestic economic product--in other words, a 1.5 percent decline in \nproductivity and a total loss of 589,000 jobs. Adding insult to injury, \nEnron has now sued a number of utilities throughout the country--for \nalmost a $1 billion--attempting to collect penalty charges on inflated \ncontracts, cancelled when the company went bankrupt. In essence, Enron \nis asking the same consumers it gouged to pay yet again.\n  As I have discussed on the Senate floor many times, the Western \nmarket meltdown of 2000-2001 has had a profound impact on my state's \neconomy, the pocketbooks and economic well-being of my constituents--\ntoo many of whom have had to make the choice between keeping their heat \nand lights on and buying food, paying rent, and purchasing prescription \ndrugs. In some parts of Washington state, utility disconnection rates \nhave risen more than 40 percent. People just can't pay their utility \nbills.\n  As my colleagues can imagine, what we have seen and heard since the \nheight of the crisis--as we have learned about the market manipulation \nand fraud that took place in the Western market, while Enron energy \ntraders laughed about the plight of ``Grandma Millie''--has added \ntremendous insult to substantial economic injury. Moreover, the Western \ncrisis has brought to the forefront a number of very important policy \nquestions about the kind of behavior that will be tolerated in our \nNation's electricity markets, as the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission has continued to pursue its ``restructuring'' agenda.\n  I believe we need strong leadership that will condemn the types of \nschemes\n\n[[Page S225]]\n\nused by Enron traders--manipulation tactics with infamous nicknames \nlike Get Shorty, Death Star and Ricochet. We need to send a strong and \nunanimous message that these practices will not be tolerated in our \nnation's electricity markets. Next, we need to agree--as a matter of \npolicy--that the victims of these schemes should not have to pay the \ninflated power prices resulting from market manipulation. The ENRON Act \nwill make these commonsense principles the law of the land.\n  I would like to thank the original cosponsors of this legislation, \nthe Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Bingaman, the Senator from California, \nMrs. Feinstein, the senior Senator from Washington, Mrs. Murray, and \nthe junior Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. Feingold, for joining me today. \nIt is our hope that the Senate will move toward swift passage of the \nENRON Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the legislation \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 33\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Electricity Needs Rules and \n     Oversight Now (ENRON) Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PROHIBITION OF ENERGY MARKET MANIPULATION.\n\n       (a) Prohibition.--Part II of the Federal Power Act (16 \n     U.S.C. 824 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n\n     ``SEC. 215. PROHIBITION OF MARKET MANIPULATION.\n\n       ``It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or \n     indirectly, to use or employ, in connection with the purchase \n     or sale of electric energy or the purchase or sale of \n     transmission services subject to the jurisdiction of the \n     Commission, any manipulative or deceptive device or \n     contrivance in contravention of such regulations as the \n     Commission may promulgate as appropriate in the public \n     interest or for the protection of electric ratepayers.''.\n       (b) Rates Resulting From Market Manipulation.--Section \n     205(a) of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 824d(a)) is \n     amended by inserting after ``not just and reasonable'' the \n     following: ``or that result from a manipulative or deceptive \n     device or contrivance''.\n\n  Mr. President, I am proud to cosponsor the Energy Needs Regulatory \nOversight Now or ENRON Act of 2005, S. 33, introduced today by Senator \nCantwell. Last summer the release of audiotapes of Enron traders \ngloating about their ability to manipulate energy markets shocked the \nNation. As more tapes surface and energy prices continue to rise, the \nneed for the Senate to pass the ENRON Act has never been more clear.\n  A public utility near Seattle, which is trying to get back the money \nit lost to Enron's unscrupulous energy trading practices, received the \ntapes from the Justice Department. These tapes confirm what we all \nsuspected: Enron manipulated energy markets and gouged consumers. \nAccording to these tapes, Enron traders celebrated when a forest fire \nshut down a major transmission line into California in 2000. This \nshutdown cut power supplies and raised energy prices. An energy trader \nsang: ``Burn, baby, burn. That's a beautiful thing.'' These taped \nconversations also provide evidence that Enron made secret pacts with \npower producers, and Enron traders deliberately drove up prices by \nordering power plants to shut down. The traders also brag about their \nability to manipulate markets and steal money from the ``grandmothers \nof California,'' who one trader called ``Grandma Millie.'' The \narrogance of these traders shocks the conscience. It also demonstrates \nthe need for Congress to protect consumers from energy market \nmanipulation. We cannot let the market abuses that took place during \nthe Western energy crisis of 2000 happen again.\n  S. 2105 requires the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to prohibit \nthe use of manipulative practices like these that put at risk consumers \nand the reliability of the transmission grid. We learned from this \ncrisis that electricity markets need close government oversight to \nensure that companies do not engage in risky and deceptive trading \nschemes leading to soaring energy prices and their own possible \nfinancial failure. In both cases, consumers--the people who depend upon \nthe electricity these companies generate or trade--are the losers.\n  The Senate recently went on record in support of barring abusive \nenergy market practices when it approved an amendment to the fiscal \nyear 2004 agricultural appropriations bill offered by Senator Cantwell. \nI am disappointed this language was stripped from the omnibus spending \nbill. These necessary protections were also omitted from the final \nenergy conference report and the revised energy bill we voted on in \nApril 2004.\n  We need to send a clear message to the energy industry that this \nbehavior will not be tolerated, and we must show consumers that we will \nprotect them from energy market manipulation. I encourage my fellow \ncolleagues to pass this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LIEBERMAN:\n  S. 34. A bill to provide for the development of a global tsunami \ndetection and warning system, to improve existing communication of \ntsunami warnings to all potentially affected nations, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat would close the gaps in our present tsunami warning system and \nestablish a global network that will give all the world's coastal \ncommunities a chance to evacuate--much like the hurricane and typhoon \nwarning system works today across international boundaries.\n  Although the probability is slim, the United States, like all coastal \nnations, is vulnerable to tsunamis. The threat to the Pacific is \ngreatest because of its relatively extensive seismic activity. But \nwhile the threat is less in the Atlantic, it also does exist. Tsunamis \nearly in the last century struck coastal Newfoundland and regions of \nthe Caribbean including Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n  As events last month in the Indian Ocean have shown, a large tsunami \ncan be catastrophic when it catches a coastal population unwarned and \nunprepared. Existing technology, however, can detect tsunamis and with \nthe right forecasting models, be used to predict potential landfall of \na tsunami and provide the warning needed for those in the path of the \ndestructive waves.\n  The United States has been a leader in developing instrumentation for \ndetecting tsunamis and developing forecasting models used for \npredicting tsunami landfall. Such technology is used in two existing \ntsunami warning centers, one in Alaska and one in Hawaii. The recent \ntsunami in South Asia has alerted the world to the dangers of these \ndestructive waves, and has caused many of us to seek ways that the \nUnited States can help the world avoid such tragic loss again.\n  The legislation I am introducing today builds on the existing United \nStates model. It authorizes funding that will enable us to expand our \nexisting capabilities, completes our network of seismic and tsunami \nsensors, and directs us to work in partnership with other nations as \nneeded to build additional centers and the necessary network for \ndisseminating warnings to the appropriate local officials. Similar \nefforts are being put forth by Senators Stevens and Inouye as leaders \nof the Commerce Committee, and by the Administration. I look forward to \nworking with them to enact legislation which, at relatively low cost, \nwill allow us to partner with other nations and complete a global \ndetection and warning system. This will help ensure that the kind of \ntragedy that befell the nations of the Indian Ocean region never \nhappens again.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 34\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION. 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend \nthe credit for production of electricity from wind; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Wind Energy \nProduction Tax Credit Extension Act. This legislation is very important \nfor the expansion and competitiveness of the wind energy sector in \nNorth Dakota and the rest of the country.\n  There should be no doubt that the wind energy production tax credit, \nPTC, is vital for the continued growth of the wind energy sector. The \nPTC was enacted in 1992. Delays in renewing the PTC have caused a boom-\nand-bust cycle in the development of new wind projects. These delays of \nthe credit inhibit the development of a favorable and secure investment \nclimate for wind projects and are also economically damaging as \ncompanies involved in wind energy lay off workers or put off hiring \nuntil the credit is extended. Given the long lead time required to \ndevelop new wind projects, short-term extensions of the credit do not \ngive companies enough certainty to expand wind energy production. We \nneed a long-term extension to provide that certainty.\n  Wind energy is an important component of our Nation's energy \nportfolio. Wind is a clean source of energy that fosters economic \ndevelopment in rural communities. Combined with other domestic sources \nof energy, the use of wind energy helps reduce our dependence on \nforeign sources of energy. In addition, advanced wind energy technology \ncould one day be an important component of a hydrogen-based economy. In \norder to ensure that wind power remains competitive with other fuels, \npassage of a longer-term wind PTC is necessary.\n  In my home State, a long-term extension of the wind PTC is especially \nimportant. North Dakota is ranked number one in wind energy potential. \nAs in other parts of the country, reliance on Congress to re-extend the \nwind PTC prevents companies tied to wind energy from adding workers and \nnegotiating long-term contracts. In general terms, this uncertainty \ninflicts economic costs on communities and certain manufacturers. For \nNorth Dakota, a long-term wind PTC extension is vital to continue the \ndevelopment of wind energy resources that are second to none.\n  The bill I am introducing today will extend the wind energy PTC, \nindexed to inflation, for five years. I believe that Congress has the \nresponsibility to ensure that the wind energy sector in this country \ngrows at its full potential. In my view, wind is a crucial part of our \ncountry's energy portfolio and energy security. This bill will help the \nwind energy industry grow and remain competitive with other types of \nenergy. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INOUYE:\n  S. 36. A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to recognize the \nUnited States Military Cancer Institute as an establishment within the \nUniformed\n\n[[Page S227]]\n\nServices University of the Health Sciences, to require the Institute to \npromote the health of members of the Armed Forces and their dependents \nby enhancing cancer research and treatment, to provide for a study of \nthe epidemiological causes of cancer among various ethnic groups for \ncancer prevention and early detection efforts, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I introduce the United States \nMilitary Cancer Institute Research Collaborative Act. This legislation \nwould formally establish the United States Military Cancer Institute \n(USMCI), and support the collaborative augmentation of research efforts \nin cancer epidemiology, prevention and control. Although the USMCI \nalready exists as an informal collaborative effort, this bill will \nformally establish the institution with a mission of providing for the \nmaintenance of health in the military by enhancing cancer research and \ntreatment, and studying the epidemiological causes of cancer among \nvarious ethnic groups. By formally establishing the USMCI, it will be \nin a better position to unite military research efforts with other \ncancer research centers.\n  Cancer prevention, early detection, and treatment are significant \nissues for the military population, thus the USMCI was organized to \ncoordinate the existing military cancer assets. The USMCI has a \ncomprehensive database of its beneficiary population of 9 million \npeople. The military's nationwide tumor registry, the Automated Central \nTumor Registry, has acquired more than 180,000 cases in the last 14 \nyears, and a serum repository of 30 million specimens from military \npersonnel collected sequentially since 1987. This population is \npredominantly Caucasian, African-American, and Hispanic.\n  The Director of the USMCI, Dr. John Potter, is a Professor of Surgery \nat the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS). A \nhighly talented cancer epidemiologist, Dr. Kangmin Zhu, has also been \nrecruited to lead the USMCI Prevention and Control Programs.\n  The USMCI currently resides in the Washington, D.C., area, and its \ncomponents are located at the National Naval Medical Center, the \nMalcolm Grow Medical Center, the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, \nand the Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute. There are more \nthan 70 research workers, both active duty and Department of Defense \ncivilian scientists, working in the USMCI.\n  The USMCI intends to expand its research activities to military \nmedical centers across the Nation. Special emphasis will be placed on \nthe study of genetic and environmental factors in carcinogenesis among \nthe entire population, including Asian, Caucasian, African-American and \nHispanic subpopulations.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 36\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to extend the special postage stamp for breast cancer \nresearch for 2 years; to the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Hutchison and \nmyself, I rise today to introduce legislation to reauthorize the \ntremendously successful Breast Cancer Research Stamp for 2 additional \nyears.\n  Without Congressional action, the Breast Cancer Research Stamp will \nexpire on December 31 of this year.\n  The life of this extraordinary stamp deserves to be extended as it \nhas proven to be a highly effective and self-supporting fundraiser.\n  Since 1998, the American people have bought over 588 million breast \ncancer stamps--raising $42.66 million for breast cancer research.\n  The National Cancer Institute and the Department of Defense have put \nthese research dollars to good use by funding novel and innovative \nresearch in the area of breast cancer.\n  Over a 7 year period, the Breast Cancer Stamp has demonstrated a very \nsustained and committed customer base.\n  Millions of Americans have bought the stamps to honor loved ones with \nthe disease, to highlight their own personal battle with breast cancer \nor to promote general public awareness--in hope of helping to find a \ncure.\n  One cannot calculate in dollars and cents how the stamp has focused \npublic awareness on this devastating disease and the need for \nadditional research funding.\n  There is still so much more to do because this disease has far \nreaching effects on our Nation:\n  Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women in \nthe United States, ranking second among cancer deaths in women after \nlung cancer.\n  In 2005, approximately 211,240 women in the U.S. will get breast \ncancer.\n  About 40,410 women will die from the disease this year.\n  There are over two million women living today in the U.S. who have \nbeen treated for breast cancer.\n  Though much less common, about 1,300 men in America are diagnosed \nwith breast cancer each year.\n  It is imperative that we extend the life of this stamp so that we can \ncontinue to reach out to American women and men who do not know of \ntheir cancer and to those who are living with it.\n  This legislation would extend the authorization of the Breast Cancer \nResearch stamp for two additional years until December 31, 2007.\n  The stamp would continue to have a surcharge of up to 25 percent \nabove the value of a first-class stamp with the surplus revenues going \nto breast cancer research.\n  Extending the Breast Cancer Research stamp does not affect any other \nsemi-postal proposals under consideration by the Postal Service.\n  We urge our colleagues to join us in passing this important \nlegislation to extend the Breast Cancer Research Stamp for another 2 \nyears.\n  Thanks to breakthroughs in cancer research, more and more people are \nbecoming cancer survivors rather than cancer victims. Every dollar we \ncontinue to raise will help save lives.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n\n[[Page S228]]\n\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 37\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. 2-YEAR EXTENSION OF POSTAGE STAMP FOR BREAST \n                   CANCER RESEARCH.\n\n       Section 414(h) of title 39, United States Code, is amended \n     by striking ``2005'' and inserting ``2007''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. NELSON of Nebraska (for himself, Mr. Domenici, and Mr. \n        Craig):\n  S. 41.

The bipartisan \nRural Community Arsenic Relief Act (RCARA) will amend the Safe Drinking \nWater Act to exempt small rural communities with population of up to \nten thousand from the EPA's strict requirement to limit arsenic in \ndrinking water to 10 parts per billion by January 1, 2006. Currently \nthe allowable level of arsenic in drinking water is 50 ppb.\n  As a former governor who fought against unfunded Federal mandates \nfrom Washington, I understand the impact a policy such as this can have \non local budgets.\n  Small rural communities simply don't have the resources and tax base \nto meet the arsenic standard arbitrarily set by the EPA. This unfunded \nmandate is a strain on local government budgets and will drive up local \ntaxes. It is not right to ask the elected officials of our small \ncommunities to spend their limited funds on risks that we are learning \nare not as dangerous as they have been portrayed. This legislation will \nallow local governments more time to plan for and absorb the costs of \nmeeting the EPA's standards for arsenic.\n  With each passing day it is increasingly evident that small \ncommunities will not be able to count on any immediate federal \nassistance in converting their water systems to meet the new arsenic \nstandard. This bipartisan bill represents one means of giving more time \nto these communities, most of which have lived with arsenic--a widely \ndistributed naturally occurring element--for ages.\n  Rural communities across America are grasping for solutions to comply \nwith the new arsenic standard. Many reach the same conclusion--it is \njust too expensive. RCARA acknowledges that this is happening, \nrecognizes that a one-size-fits-all solution doesn't work, and provides \na framework to protect public health, while at the same time giving \ncommunities the flexibility they need to comply.\n  State officials in Nebraska estimate it could cost communities $120 \nmillion--$176 million to comply with the standard. Many communities, \nfearing that this regulation could bankrupt them, are considering \ndramatically raising rates for drinking water to cover the cost of new \ntreatment and equipment. Extending the deadline is crucial for \ntaxpayers and ratepayers throughout the country.\n  This bill allows small communities to adopt a locally supported \npublic health policy as an alternative to the one prescribed by EPA. In \nmany communities, the rule can reasonably be expected to more than \ndouble water rates on low-income families without improving the quality \nof their water in any appreciative manner. Our bill provides a \nreasonable amount of time for our small communities to understand and \nimplement EPA's requirements, without bankrupting the system. It is the \nleast we should do.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise to address an issue that has begun \nto emerge and gain our attention in rural America. This issue is an \nimportant one because it has the potential to devastate, economically, \nsmall cities and towns across the inter-mountain west--like in my \nState, of Idaho.\n  The new Environmental Protection Agency drinking water standard of 10 \nparts per billion for arsenic is something the current Administration \ninherited from the prior Administration and is now trying to implement. \nI would remind my colleagues, however, that the new lowered arsenic \nstandard was not universally supported in Congress when it was \nproposed.\n  There were Senators--not many, but I was certainly one of them--that \nknew that the cost of complying with the new arsenic standard was going \nto cripple economically--was going to break the back financially--of \nrural communities and small towns across the western United States.\n  I fought this new standard on the floor of the Senate. I knew the \ncosts were crippling and the health benefit was bogus. I also knew that \nthe science to support the lower standard is being exposed as based on \nexamples and sample populations that were very, very flawed. The \nscience is now revealing that extrapolating from those sample \ncommunities to the whole of the United States was a very, very flawed \nbasis for the drinking water standard.\n  I fought this new standard, but I did not succeed.\n  There are communities now in Idaho that will not be able to come into \ncompliance with this new standard by the time it takes effect. Some of \nthese Idaho communities have estimated that it would take double or \ntriple their entire city budget, just to try to come into compliance--\nand that would mean that no other city services could be paid for.\n  That kind of situation is clearly ridiculous, and I will fight as \nlong and as hard as I can to find solutions to this problem.\n  Last year, I raised this issue with then-EPA Administrator Mike \nLeavitt. Mike Leavitt is a Westerner--his folks in Utah are having some \nof the same problems.\n  I discussed the issue with him. I will raise it with any successor of \nhis who is nominated to head the EPA. I will keep raising this issue \nand looking for solutions. The problem is that EPA bureaucrats--who are \nso good at being bureaucrats--think they know Idaho better than \nIdahoans do. Some of our Idaho communities have requested of EPA Region \n10 that EPA exercise some flexibility with this standard. This is \nflexibility that EPA has already incorporated into its final agency \nrule on the arsenic standard.\n  Unfortunately, EPA bureaucrats are doing what they are good at. They \nare saying no to flexibility and hey, by the way, Castleford, Idaho or \nNew Plymouth, Idaho--this won't disadvantage you economically as much \nas you say. That is what EPA says to the communities of Idaho. We know \nbetter than you.\n  Seeing that EPA cannot be reasonable, I have worked with my \ncolleagues Senator Nelson of Nebraska and Senator Domenici of New \nMexico. Both of their States have similar problems. The product of our \ncollaboration is a bill that we introduced last year and are re-\nintroducing today. The name of this bill is the Rural Community Arsenic \nRelief Act. While it may not provide all the relief that I would like \nto see, and it does not repeal the new arsenic standard--as I believe \nis merited by the science--this bill is a good compromise and a good \nstart.\n  With this bill, we are trying to force States--and in Idaho's case, \nthe EPA since Idaho is what they call a ``non-primacy state''--to \napprove requests from communities to delay their compliance with the \nnew arsenic standard.\n  The bill is straightforward, it is vital, and it is needed. It will \nsave some of these communities from bankruptcy or from discontinuing \nessential community services. Many other States--other than Idaho, \nNebraska, and New Mexico--face this same crisis. I implore my \ncolleagues to learn about what their small communities are facing, and \nto join with us in enacting this essential regulatory relief.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLEN (for himself, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. DeWine, Mr. \n        Nelson of Nebraska, Mrs. Dole, Ms. Murkowski, and Mr. Vitter).\n  S. 42. A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to increase the \ndeath gratuity payable with respect to deceased members of the Armed \nForces, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n[[Page S229]]\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise to bring to my colleagues' attention \na bill I introduced today called the Honoring the Fallen Soldiers and \nFamilies Act of 2005, sharing the same views of Senator Sessions of \nAlabama, who has worked on this legislation, as well as many of us over \nthe years, including my partner, Senator Warner. This measure is \noriginally cosponsored by Senators Bill Nelson, Mike DeWine, Ben \nNelson, Elizabeth Dole, Lisa Murkowski, and David Vitter.\n  Mr. President, as Americans, I believe we need to do everything we \ncan to make sure our men and women in uniform are provided with the \nmost technologically advanced armaments and equipment for their safety \nand their security when they are protecting our liberty. We also need \nto take care of the families of the soldiers who lose their lives, \nthose who are killed in action and on duty. We need to care more about \ntheir surviving families.\n  Currently, there are a number of benefits that are provided to family \nmembers who lose a loved one while serving our great Nation. Some of \nthese benefits include the Servicemen's Group Life Insurance policies, \nthe Dependency and Indemnity Compensation Program, education benefits, \nand Government housing.\n  However, there is one benefit I have been concerned with during my \ntenure in the Senate. This is called the military death gratuity. It is \na tax-exempt cash payment, currently at the amount of $12,000, which \nprovides immediate financial compensation to families of those service \nmen and women who have lost their lives serving our great Nation. \nDuring the past 108th Congress, I cosponsored legislation authored by \nSenator Susan Collins of Maine to double the death gratuity from $6,000 \nto $12,000, which at the time was apparently a big deal, since Congress \nhad sparingly raised the death gratuity since its inception in 1908. \nThe last increase before then was at the end of the first gulf war in \n1991. Even then, half of that benefit was subjected to taxation.\n  Some of us in Congress understood the need to provide this financial \nassistance and were able to get this provision included in a larger \nbill, the Military Family Tax Relief Act of 2003. Not only did this \nlegislation double the death gratuity from $6,000 to $12,000, but it \nalso made the payments of these moneys tax exempt.\n  However, that is not enough, $12,000. I still believe this current \namount of $12,000 is a miserly and paltry amount. Indeed, I consider it \ninsulting. I have been speaking with people from Virginia and all \nacross America and listening to them. It is confirmed to me how truly \ninsulting this sum of money is. My sense is that a grateful Nation \nwants to better help the widows, widowers, and the children of those \nwho have given their lives and their futures in defense of our country \nand our liberties, whether it was in Afghanistan, Iraq, or elsewhere in \nthe world.\n  When I was bringing this issue up, I got an e-mail and many messages \nfrom people across the country. This one is from Mrs. Margaret \nStubenhofer from Springfield, VA, who wrote:\n\n       Dear Senator Allen: On December 7, 2004, our son Captain \n     Mark Stubenhofer (U.S. Army) was killed in action while \n     serving in Iraq. He was shot by insurgents. Mark, who was \n     born and raised in Springfield, VA, leaves behind his wife \n     (Patty, age 30) and 3 small children (Lauren, 5 yrs, Justin, \n     2\\1/2\\ yrs, and Hope, 4 months). I am writing to you in \n     support of the proposed legislation to raise the military \n     survivor benefits. It is appalling to me that our people, who \n     also suffered a great tragedy, are receiving millions of \n     dollars after their loved ones died on 9-11 . . . yet, \n     dependents of military personnel killed in action while \n     bravely serving their country in a foreign land receive only \n     slightly more than $12,000 as a death gratuity and $100,000 \n     in insurance benefits. I am very much in favor of these \n     benefits being raised to a more reasonable level; and I ask \n     you to continue to support such action as to make this \n     possible. In all good conscience, how can we possibly ask \n     these young men and women to be ready to die for their \n     country . . . and then leave their survivors with almost \n     nothing when their worst nightmare actually becomes a \n     reality?\n\n  That is a good question. That is why I am introducing, with a number \nof my Senate colleagues who are cosponsoring, the Honoring Our Fallen \nSoldiers and Families Act of 2005. I am glad this is getting a lot of \nsupport from both sides of the aisle and leadership.\n  This legislation will raise the military death gratuity from $12,000 \nto $100,000 for the families of those service men and women who have \nlost their lives serving our great Nation since October 1, 2001. The \nreason for October 1, 2001--the retroactivity--is that is when the \nmilitary action began in Afghanistan. As I mentioned, there a number of \nother benefits that family members whose loved one has died will \nreceive, but unlike the death gratuity that reaches family members \nwithin 48 hours of the death, the other benefits can take some time--in \nfact, months--to make it to the family. That is just too long a period \nof time. They will eventually get it, but that short-term, immediate \ninflux of money helps provide for the monetary stability at a time of \ngreat grief and uncertainty. The money can help pay for a home mortgage \nor for rent or gas or utilities bills, car payments, or schooling. \nSchool kids may be in schools where there are expenses. It will also \nhelp put food on the table. As a matter of fact, many of the fallen \nsoldiers were the sole or significant breadwinner for the families, and \nthe families are left without any immediate source of income.\n  It is doubly important for members of the Guard and Reserve. \nApproximately a quarter to a third of those who serve in the Guard and \nReserve actually take a pay cut when they are called up or activated to \nserve. While it is a source of income that may be less than they were \nreceiving in the private sector, it is still a significant, substantial \npart of that family household's income. So when a soldier loses his or \nher life, even if it is a lower amount, the money stops. That is why it \nis imperative that we in Congress raise the death gratuity to a level \nthat will take care of the immediate financial needs of these families.\n  Some have questioned or critics may argue that raising the death \ngratuity to $100,000 is too costly. I contend that if you look at \nfirefighters and police officers, these great citizens of our \ncommunities who are our warriors at home, saving lives from fires or in \nlaw enforcement actions, they generally get a death gratuity in the \namount of $50,000 to $100,000. In our Commonwealth of Virginia, a \npolice officer or firefighter who loses his or her life in the line of \nduty receives a $75,000 death gratuity. My proposal is to put some \nlogical symmetry between what our warriors on the homefront--the police \nofficers and firefighters--get and what our soldiers stationed at home \nand abroad get.\n  In addition, as long as we have an all-volunteer Army, we need to \nmake sure our soldiers know and their families know they have the best \npossible benefits should the unthinkable happen. I believe this \nlegislation will help put some of those worries at ease. Whatever the \namount may be, I guarantee to each of my colleagues that any family \nwould rather have their loved one there at holidays and birthdays and \nanniversaries than the $100,000, but there is a big financial hole in \ntheir lives. There is also one that cannot be compensated. But it is \none that a grateful Nation would want to provide.\n  I will close by quoting George Washington, who was one of our \ngreatest leaders, when he made a very wise and still cogent \nobservation.\n  He cautioned that the willingness of future generations to fight for \ntheir country, no matter how just the cause, will be proportional to \nhow they perceive previous veterans were treated.\n  It is important that we show a deeper appreciation for those heroic \nsoldiers who died defending our liberty and also their brave families \nback home who have paid the ultimate sacrifice as well. This \nlegislation is a significant striding step in that direction.\n  I urge my colleagues in the Senate to quickly act on this legislation \nand all others trying to help our families of fallen heroes and their \nloved ones and pass these measures as quickly as possible, and also \nmake them retroactive for all of those nearly 1,500 who have lost their \nlives protecting our freedom, advancing liberty throughout the world, \nand people who are truly American heroes whom we will always remember.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HAGEL (for himself, Mr. Coleman, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. DeWine, \n        and Mr. Obama):\n  S. 43. A bill to provide certain enhancements to the Montgomery GI \nBill Program for certain individuals who serve as members of the Armed \nForces\n\n[[Page S230]]\n\nafter the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. Hagel. Mr. President, I rise today to re-introduce the ``Military \nDeath Benefit Improvement Act of 2005'' and the ``G.I. Bill Enhancement \nAct of 2005.'' These pieces of legislation recognize the service and \nsacrifice of the men and women of our armed forces who are proudly and \nbravely serving our country around the world. These bills also \nrecognize the sacrifices borne by the families of our men and women in \nuniform.\n  The ``Military Death Benefit Improvement Act of 2005'' would raise \nthe military death gratuity paid to the families of military personnel \nkilled while on active duty from $12,000 to $100,000. This increase \nwould also be applied retroactively to all service members on active \nduty who have died since September 11, 2001.\n  The military death gratuity is money provided within 72 hours to \nfamilies of service members who are killed while on active duty. These \nfunds assist next-of-kin with their immediate financial needs.\n  Though nothing can replace the hole left in a family by the loss of a \nson, daughter, mother or father, this bill will help alleviate some of \nthe financial hardships faced by the families of our brave service men \nand women who give their lives in service to our country. It will send \na message to our brave young men and women and their families that \ntheir Nation appreciates their service and sacrifice.\n  As we face the challenges of the 21st Century, service men and women \nsacrificing for their country in a time of war should be assured that \ntheir families will be taken care of. The loss of a loved one is a \ntremendous emotional hardship for families. Congress must do what it \ncan to ensure that it does not cause devastating financial hardship as \nwell.\n  I also rise today to re-introduce the ``G.I. Bill Enhancement Act of \n2005.'' This legislation would waive the Montgomery G.I. Bill program's \n$1,200 enrollment fee for active duty members of our Nation's military.\n  The G.I. Bill Enhancement Act covers any member of the United States \nmilitary, including Reserve and National Guard members, serving on \nactive duty during the period after President Bush's November 2001 \nExecutive Order that placed the military on a wartime footing. This \nlegislation would: Waive the G.I. Bill enrollment fee until President \nBush's November 2001 Executive Order is rescinded; allow all service \nmen and women to opt into the G.I. Bill with no penalty or enrollment \nfee; and reimburse those service men and women covered by this bill who \nhave already paid the $1,200 enrollment fee prior to the enactment of \nthis legislation.\n  The current Montgomery G.I. Bill is tailored to serve members of our \nmilitary in a time of peace. Upon enlistment, recruits are given the \noption of enrolling in the G.I. Bill. If they choose to participate, \nthey are charged a $1,200 enrollment fee which is deducted from their \nmonthly pay over 12 months. However, we are now in a time of war and \nthe demands on our service members and their families have been \ntransformed and increased. To that end, changes must be made to the \nG.I. Bill to ensure that it continues to provide realistic and relevant \neducational opportunities to those who are defending our country.\n  This is an issue of fundamental fairness. The men and women serving \nour country in wartime should not have to choose between the long-term \nbenefits of the G.I. Bill and the short-term demands of their paycheck. \nThe G.I. Bill is one of the great legacies of military service to our \ncountry. Men and women sacrificing for their country in a time of war \nneed to be assured that access to higher education is in their future. \nCongress must do all it can to ensure that education options for our \nveterans are accessible and real.\n  The G.I. Bill has long been recognized as one of the most important \nCongressional acts of post World War II America. This legislation \nensured that all who served their Nation would not be penalized as a \nresult of their time away from their careers and communities in service \nto their country. The G.I. Bill helped members of our ``greatest \ngeneration'' upon their return home by providing them with the \neducational tools necessary to pursue the opportunities enjoyed by all \nAmericans.\n  Over the last 60 years, the Federal Government has invested billions \nof dollars in education benefits for our Nation's veterans. Over 21 \nmillion men and women have benefitted from the G.I. Bill, resulting in \na workforce that transformed American society. The bill's far-reaching \nimpact can be seen here today, as Members of this body, including this \nSenator, have prospered as a result of the benefits of the G.I. Bill.\n  Every American should be proud of how we have responded to the \nchallenges of terrorism following September 11, 2001. We owe much to \nthe men and women who have fought bravely in Afghanistan and Iraq. The \n``Military Death Benefit Improvement Act of 2005'' and the ``G.I. Bill \nEnhancement Act of 2005'' recognize these sacrifices. I hope that my \nSenate colleagues will give serious consideration to these important \npieces of legislation, and that we will pass these bills and they will \nbe signed into law by President Bush. I ask unanimous consent that the \ntext of these two bills be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bills were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 43\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Controlled Substances Act to lift the \npatient limitation on prescribing drug addiction treatments by medical \npractitioners in group practices, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the legislation I am introducing today \nalong with my colleagues Senator Hatch and Senator Biden, addresses an \nunintended effect of a provision in the original Drug Abuse and \nTreatment Act of 2000 (DATA) that hinders access to a revolutionary new \ntreatment for thousands of individuals who seek it.\n  When Congress passed DATA as Title XXXV of the Children's Health Act \nof 2000, it allowed for the dispensing and prescribing of Schedule III \ndrugs, like buprenorphine/naloxone, in an office-based setting, for the \ntreatment of heroin addiction. As a result of DATA, access to treatment \nis significantly expanded; patients no longer are restricted to \nreceiving treatment in a large public clinic, usually at a great \ndistance, but now may receive such care in the private, nearby office \nof qualified physicians.\n  DATA limits individual physicians to treating no more than 30-\npatients at a time. Unfortunately, the law results in the same 30-\npatient limit on physician group practices. The difficulties that have \narisen, including the dashed hopes for treatment of many, have resulted \nin the underutilization of this proven therapy all across this country, \nincluding my home state of Michigan.\n  One of the authors of DATA, I can tell you that it clearly was not \nour intention that individuals seeking this new treatment have less \naccess simply because they receive care from a physician practicing in \na group, or from a group-based or mixed-model health plan. \nNevertheless, this is the effect and it is having a severe effect.\n  The problem is addressed by removing the 30-patient aggregate limit \non medical groups. This is achieved in the bill we are introducing \ntoday. Our bill simply removes the statutory limit on physician group \npractices, while maintaining the 30-patient limit on each physician. I \nam pleased that the Senate has already gone on record in support of \nthis modification to DATA. On October 11, 2004, the Senate Passed S. \n2976, to remove the 30-patient limit on the group practices. However, \nthe House adjourned before acting on the legislation. It is our hope \nthat the bill we are introducing today will receive speedy action in \nboth the Senate and House in the very near future.\n  Mr. President, I would like to share some of the sentiments that have \nbeen expressed in support of the group practice modification, as well \nas some first hand accounts of individuals who are being successfully \ntreated with buprenorphine/naloxone. Dr. Charles Schuster, a former \ndirector of the National Institute on Drug Abuse who currently heads \nthe Addiction Research Institute at Wayne State University, writes:\n\n       We have three physicians in a group, all of whom have been \n     trained and granted waivers by the U.S. Department of Health \n     and Human Services to prescribe Suboxone and Subutex for the \n     treatment of opiate addiction. All are specialists in the \n     treatment of addictive disorders. Rather than being able to \n     bring this potentially life saving therapy to 90 members of \n     our community, they are restricted to a total of thirty.\n       This situation is particularly heart breaking in places \n     where there are a few or only one provider. This situation \n     will only get worse as physicians and practice plans reach \n     their 30-patient limitation.\n       I have been involved in the development of Suboxone and \n     Subutex for the treatment of opiate addiction for many years. \n     It is a safer medication with less abuse potential than \n     methadone. It allows people who fear public knowledge of \n     their addictive disease to more discreetly seek help from a \n     private physician. It is a medication that can be used for a \n     short period with adolescents who have become addicted to \n     opiates because it is easier to taper them off of this drug \n     than methadone. In short, office-based practice with Suboxone \n     and Subutex is a major addition to our country's treatment \n     system for opiate addiction. It is essential that we remove \n     the impediment of limiting Physician Practice Plans to 30 \n     patients so that each of the physicians in such Practice \n     Plans who are trained to use this medication can bring their \n     services to those in need.\n\n  Peter DeMarco, in an article in the May 30, 2004 Boston Globe, \nwrites:\n\n       When buprenorphine became available as a treatment for \n     OxyContin and heroin addiction 18 months ago, many medical \n     professionals and addicts hailed it as a miracle drug, \n     bringing addicts back from the brink and helping them lead \n     normal lives when all else had failed. But for many addicts, \n     buprenorphine remains one of the hardest drugs to obtain. . . \n     . (B)prenorphine doesn't cloud the minds of patients, \n     allowing them to work or study as if they're not on any drug \n     at all. Nearly all who take buprenorphine, meanwhile, say \n     they lose all physical cravings for street drugs.\n       But a combination of federal limits on the distribution of \n     buprenorphine . . . has kept thousands of opiate addicts from \n     receiving the drug in Massachusetts and across the country. \n     At the heart of the issue is federal legislation passed in \n     2000--two years before the drug was approved by the FDA--that \n     restricts individual clinical practices from treating more \n     than 30 patients with buprenorphine at a time.\n       While many substance-abuse experts say the 30-patient \n     figure is too low for some practices, their main quarrel with \n     the Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 2000 is its failure to \n     differentiate single-physician practices, hospitals, and \n     health care organizations. For example, all the doctors who \n     work for Tufts Health Plan can treat a combined 30 patients--\n     the same total as can be seen by a physician practicing \n     alone.\n       Boston health officials, along with their counterparts in \n     the State and Federal governments, say the Federal \n     legislation erred on the side of caution, and needs to be \n     changed to allow wider access to buprenorphine.\n       ``Boston Medical Center's main practice has 200 or more \n     general internal-medicine doctors, and within that practice, \n     we can only treat 30 people. It's the craziest loophole,'' \n     said Colleen Labelle, nurse-manager of the hospital's Office-\n     Based Opioid Treatment Program. ``We get 20 calls a day from\n\n[[Page S232]]\n\n     across the state. People are begging, desperate to get \n     treated, who we can't treat.''\n       The Federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services \n     Administration has begun an internal process to increase the \n     30-patient cap. But because any proposed change would be \n     subject to the public-review process, approval could take as \n     long as two years, said Nick Reuter, a senior public health \n     analyst with the agency.\n       Timothy Tigges says his addiction began after he wrenched \n     his back and bummed a few Percocet pills, a prescription \n     analgesic, from a friend to dull the pain. Before he knew it, \n     he was hooked on opiates, alternating between OxyContin and \n     shooting up heroin as his life went to pieces.\n       In October, Tigges, a 27-year-old East Boston carpet \n     installer, began taking buprenorphine, placing an orange pill \n     the size of a dime under his tongue until it dissolves, four \n     times daily. He hasn't touched an illegal drug since the day \n     he started the program, has put on 80 pounds from lifting \n     weights at the gym, and has yet to miss a day of work. For \n     the first time in three years, Tigges hopes to see his 5-\n     year-old daughter, whose mother has refused to let him visit.\n       ``I've had clean urines, 100 percent, for nine months now. \n     There's nothing I'm prouder of than that,'' he said, choking \n     back emotion. ``What I read on the front page of the paper \n     every day is 18- and 20-year-old kids dying of garbage drugs. \n     There's just no need for it. I would take every ounce of \n     heroin off the street and give them this stuff. You watch the \n     crime rate go down.''\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nlegislation be included at the end of my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 45\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize the extension of unconditional and \npermanent nondiscriminatory treatment (permanent normal trade relations \ntreatment) to the products of Ukraine, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today I introduce with my colleague, \nSenator Lugar, a bill to grant normal trade treatment to the products \nof Ukraine. My brother, Congressman Sander Levin and other members are \nintroducing a similar bill in the House. It is our hope that enactment \nof this legislation will help to build stronger economic ties between \nthe United States and Ukraine.\n  The Cold War era Jackson-Vanik trade restrictions that deny most \nfavored nation trade status to imports from former Soviet-Bloc \ncountries are outdated and, when applied to Ukraine, inappropriate. \nThose restrictions were established as a tool to pressure Communist \nnations to allow their people to freely emigrate in exchange for \nfavorable trade treatment by the United States.\n  Ukraine does allow its citizens the right and opportunity to \nemigrate. It has met the Jackson-Vanik test. In fact, Ukraine has been \nfound to be in full compliance with the freedom of emigration \nrequirements under the Jackson-Vanik law. Ukraine has been certified as \nmeeting the Jackson-Vanik requirements on an annual basis since 1992 \nwhen a bilateral trade agreement went into effect.\n  It is time the United States recognizes this reality by eliminating \nthe Jackson-Vanik restrictions and granting Ukraine normal trading \nstatus on a permanent basis. Our bill does this as well as addressing \ntraditional Jackson-Vanik issues such as emigration, religious freedom, \nrestoration of property, and human rights. It also deals with the \nimportant trade issues that must be considered when granting a country \npermanent normal trade relations (PNTR), such as making progress toward \nWorld Trade Organization (WTO), accession and tariff and excise tax \nreductions.\n  Since reestablishing independence in 1991, Ukraine has taken \nimportant steps toward the creation of democratic institutions and a \nfree-market economy. As a member state of the Organization for Security \nand Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), Ukraine is committed to developing a \nsystem of governance in accordance with the principles regarding human \nrights that are set forth in the Final Act of the Conference on \nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe, the Helsinki Final Act.\n  On December 26, 2004, Ukraine took another historic step in its \npursuit of democracy with the legitimate election of its new President \nViktor Yuschenko. This election showed the world that Ukraine has \njoined the family of democracies. The United States can help advance \nthis young democracy by repealing our Cold War-era laws that should no \nlonger apply to them and welcoming them to the international economic \ncommunity as a full partner. This bill will accomplish these goals.\n  In addition to welcoming the Ukrainian government to the family of \ndemocracies, we must also take a moment to honor the Ukranian people \nfor their commitment to democratic institutions in civil society \nthrough peaceful demonstrations. Free and fair elections were conducted \nonly because of the courage and hard work of the Ukranian people. \nWithout their persistence Ukraine was in danger of moving forward with \nan illegitimately elected president.\n  By drawing Ukraine into normal trade relations, the international \ncommunity will be helping Ukraine to achieve greater market reform and \ncontinue its commitment to safeguarding religious liberty and enforcing \nlaws to combat discrimination. PNTR status will hopefully do more than \nincrease bilateral trade between the United States and Ukraine and \nencourage increased international investment in Ukraine. Hopefully it \nwill also stimulate the reform we all want and the Ukrainian people \ndeserve on their way to achieving a more mature and stable democracy.\n  It's time we recognize Ukraine's accomplishments and status as an \nemerging democracy and market economy by lifting the Jackson-Vanik \nrestrictions. I hope my colleagues will support this important bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 46\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) Ukraine allows its citizens the right and opportunity \n     to emigrate, free of anything more than a nominal tax on \n     emigration or on the visas or other documents required for \n     emigration and free of any tax, levy, fine, fee, or other \n     charge on any citizens as a consequence of the desire of such \n     citizens to emigrate to the country of their choice;\n       (2) Ukraine has been found to be in full compliance with \n     the freedom of emigration requirements under title IV of the \n     Trade Act of 1974 since 1997;\n       (3) since reestablishing independence in 1991, Ukraine has \n     taken important steps toward the creation of democratic \n     institutions and a free-market economy and, as a \n     participating state of the Organization for Security and \n     Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), is committed to developing a \n     system of governance in accordance with the principles \n     regarding human rights and humanitarian affairs that are set \n     forth in the Final Act of the Conference on Security and \n     Cooperation in Europe (also known as the ``Helsinki Final \n     Act'') and successive documents;\n       (4) the people of Ukraine deserve praise for demonstrating \n     a deep commitment to democracy and through peaceful civil \n     action demanding a process that achieved a fair election in \n     Ukraine's most recent Presidential runoff;\n       (5) Ukraine has made progress toward meeting international \n     commitments and standards in the most recent Presidential \n     runoff elections, including in the implementation of \n     Ukraine's new elections laws;\n       (6) as a participating state of the Organization for \n     Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), Ukraine is \n     committed to addressing issues relating to its national and \n     religious minorities and to adopting measures to ensure that \n     persons belonging to national minorities have full equality \n     both individually and communally;\n\n[[Page S233]]\n\n       (7) Ukraine has enacted legislation providing protection \n     against incitement to violence against persons or groups \n     based on national, racial, ethnic, or religious \n     discrimination, including anti-Semitism, and has committed \n     itself, including through a letter to the President of the \n     United States, to ensuring freedom of religion and combating \n     racial and ethnic intolerance and hatred;\n       (8) Ukraine has engaged in efforts to combat ethnic and \n     religious intolerance by cooperating with various United \n     States nongovernmental organizations;\n       (9) Ukraine is continuing the restitution of religious \n     properties, including religious and communal properties \n     confiscated from national and religious minorities during the \n     Soviet era, is facilitating the revival of those minority \n     groups, and remains committed to developing a legislative \n     framework for completing this process, as promised in a \n     letter to the President of the United States;\n       (10) Ukraine has received normal trade relations treatment \n     since concluding a bilateral trade agreement with the United \n     States that entered into force on June 23, 1992;\n       (11) Ukraine's accession to the World Trade Organization \n     would be a welcome step, recognizing that many issues remain \n     to be resolved, including commitments relating to access of \n     United States agricultural products, protection of \n     intellectual property rights, tariff and excise tax \n     reductions for goods (including automobiles), trade in \n     services, elimination of export incentives for industrial \n     goods, and reform of customs procedures and other non-tariff \n     barriers;\n       (12) Ukraine has enacted protections reflecting \n     internationally recognized labor rights;\n       (13) as a participating state of the OSCE, Ukraine has \n     committed itself to respecting freedom of the press, and the \n     new administration has affirmed this commitment;\n       (14) Ukraine has stated its desire to pursue a course of \n     Euro-Atlantic integration with a commitment to ensuring \n     democracy and prosperity for its citizens; and\n       (15) Ukraine has participated with the United States in its \n     peacekeeping operations in Europe and has provided important \n     cooperation in the global struggle against international \n     terrorism.\n\n     SEC. 2. TERMINATION OF APPLICATION OF TITLE IV OF THE TRADE \n                   ACT OF 1974 TO UKRAINE.\n\n       (a) Presidential Determinations and Extension of \n     Unconditional and Permanent Nondiscriminatory Treatment.--\n     Notwithstanding any provision of title IV of the Trade Act of \n     1974 (19 U.S.C. 2431 et seq.), the President may--\n       (1) determine that such title should no longer apply to \n     Ukraine; and\n       (2) after making a determination under paragraph (1) with \n     respect to Ukraine, proclaim the extension of unconditional \n     and permanent nondiscriminatory treatment (permanent normal \n     trade relations treatment) to the products of that country.\n       (b) Termination of Application of Title IV.--On and after \n     the effective date of the extension under subsection (a)(2) \n     of nondiscriminatory treatment to the products of Ukraine, \n     chapter 1 of title IV of the Trade Act of 1974 shall cease to \n     apply to that country.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of a bill that I \nhave introduced with Senator Carl Levin authorizing the extension of \npermanent normal trade relations treatment. Ukraine is still subject to \nthe provisions of the Jackson-Vanik amendment to the Trade Act of 1974, \nwhich sanctions nations for failure to comply with freedom of \nemigration requirements. Our bill would repeal permanently the \napplication of Jackson-Vanik to Ukraine.\n  In the post-cold-war era, Ukraine has demonstrated a commitment to \nmeet these requirements, and in addition, has expressed a strong desire \nto abide by free market principles and good governance. Last November, \nI served as President Bush's personal representative to the runoff \nelection between Prime Minister Yanukovich and Viktor Yushchenko. \nDuring that visit, I promoted free and fair election procedures that \nwould strengthen worldwide respect for the legitimacy of the winning \ncandidate. Unfortunately, that was not possible. The Government of \nUkraine allowed, or aided and abetted, wholesale fraud and abuse that \nchanged the results of the election. It is clear that Prime Minister \nYanukovich did not win the election.\n  In response, the people of Ukraine rallied in the streets and \ndemanded justice. After tremendous international\n\n[[Page S234]]\n\npressure and mediation, Ukraine repeated the runoff election on \nDecember 26. A newly named Central Election Commission and a new set of \nelection laws led to a much-improved process. International monitors \nconcluded that the process was generally free and fair. This past \nweekend Viktor Yushchenko was inaugurated as President of Ukraine.\n  Extraordinary events have occurred in Ukraine over the last three \nmonths. A free press has revolted against government intimidation and \nreasserted itself. An emerging middle class has found its political \nfooting. A new generation has embraced democracy and openness. A \nsociety has rebelled against the illegal activities of its government. \nIt is in our interest to recognize and protect these advances in \nUkraine.\n  The United States has a long record of cooperation with Ukraine \nthrough the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction. Ukraine inherited \nthe third largest nuclear arsenal in the world with the fall of the \nSoviet Union. Through the Nunn-Lugar program the United States has \nassisted Ukraine in eliminating this deadly arsenal and joining the \nNonproliferation Treaty as a non-nuclear State.\n  One of the areas where we can deepen United States-Ukrainian \nrelations is bilateral trade. Our trade relations between the United \nStates and Ukraine are currently governed by a bilateral trade \nagreement signed in 1992. There are other economic agreements in place \nseeking to further facilitate economic cooperation between the United \nStates and Ukraine, including a bilateral investment treaty which was \nsigned in 1996, and a taxation treaty signed in 2000. In addition, \nUkraine commenced negotiations to become a member of the World Trade \nOrganization in 1993, further demonstrating its commitment to adhere to \nfree market principles and fair trade. In light of its adherence to \nfreedom of emigration requirements, democratic principles, compliance \nwith threat reduction and several agreements on economic cooperation, \nthe products of Ukraine should not be subject to the sanctions of \nJackson-Vanik.\n  There are areas in which Ukraine needs to continue to improve. These \ninclude market access, protection of intellectual property and \nreduction of tariffs. The U.S. must remain committed to assisting \nUkraine in pursuing market economic reforms. The permanent waiver of \nJackson-Vanik and establishment of permanent normal trade relations \nwill be the foundation on which further progress in a burgeoning \neconomic partnership can be made.\n  I am hopeful that my colleagues will review this legislation and join \nSenator Levin and I in supporting this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself and Mr. Domenici):\n  S. 47. A bill to provide for the exchange of certain Federal land in \nthe Santa Fe National Forest and certain non-Federal land in the Pecos \nNational Historical Park in the State of New Mexico; to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today, I am introducing along with Mr. \nDomenici the ``Pecos National Historical Park Land Exchange Act of \n2005''. This bill will authorize a land exchange between the Federal \ngovernment and a private landowner that will benefit the Pecos National \nHistorical Park in my State of New Mexico.\n  Specifically, the bill will enable the Park Service to acquire a \nprivate inholding within the Park's boundaries in exchange for the \ntransfer of a nearby tract of National Forest System land. The National \nForest parcel has been identified as available for exchange in the \nSanta Fe National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan and is \nsurrounded by private lands on three sides.\n  The Pecos National Historical Park possesses exceptional historic and \narchaeological resources. The Park preserves the ruins of the great \nPecos pueblo, which was a major trade center, and the ruins of two \nSpanish colonial missions dating from the 17th and 18th centuries.\n  The Glorieta Unit of the Park protects key sites associated with the \n1862 Civil War Battle of Glorieta Pass, a significant event that ended \nthe Confederate attempt to expand the war into the West. This Unit will \ndirectly benefit from the land exchange.\n  Similar bills passed the Senate in both the 106th and the 108th \nCongresses, and I hope it finally will be enacted this Congress.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 47\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to reauthorize appropriations for the New Jersey \nCoastal Heritage Trail Route, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about a bill \nthat Senator Corzine and I are introducing, the New Jersey Coastal \nHeritage Trail Route bill. Our bill would reauthorize a law based on a \nbill that former Senator Bill Bradley and I first introduced in 1988. \nThat law was extended once but its authorization has now expired, \nbringing work on the Trail to a complete standstill.\n  This bill would reauthorize federal appropriations for New Jersey's \nCoastal Heritage Trail. This authority would sunset in 2009, allowing \nenough time for unfinished trail projects to be completed.\n  The 300-mile Trail is divided into five sections that extend south \nfrom Perth Amboy to Cape May and west to Deepwater. New Jersey's \nCoastal Heritage Trail is unique. It is neither a National Heritage \nArea, nor a National Trail. Collaboration on this Trail marked the \nNational Park Service's first attempt at protecting a significant \nresource without actually acquiring it. This experiment has been a \nresounding success.\n  The State of New Jersey is heavily developed, and the National Park \nService, the State, and many other public and private organizations \nhave worked hard to preserve the natural and cultural heritage along \nthe Trail.\n  This experiment has also been a bargain. Between 1988 and 2004, the \nPark Service spent 3.9 million dollars on Trail projects, while non-\nfederal sources contributed 5.4 million dollars in matching funds. \nThese funds represent an important investment in New Jersey's economy. \nLast year, 65 million visitors came to New Jersey, and the majority of \nthose visitors went to the shore where many spent time on sections of \nthe Coastal Heritage Trail.\n  In the past, Federal funds have contributed to signs and exhibits \nalong the Trail which entice tourists and local New Jerseyans to \nexplore our maritime history, coastal habitats, and wildlife migration.\n  Most people think that New Jersey is a crowded, highly industrialized \nState. That is true. But New Jersey also contains incredible beauty, \nsuch as a Bald Eagle silhouetted against a Delaware Bay sunset; a lone \nfishing boat making its way through Barnegat Inlet at dawn; or the \nquiet, dark waters flowing slowly through the Pine Barrens.\n  Such sights can be enjoyed in New Jersey, and the Coastal Heritage \nTrail invites New Jerseyans and our many visitors to enjoy these \nsplendors.\n  Mr. President, in the House, Congressman LoBiondo is sponsoring a \ncompanion bill to this legislation, so this is truly a bipartisan \neffort. The Congressman and I have worked with our respective \ncommittees of jurisdiction and have come to agreement on identical \nlanguage in our bills. So, it is my hope that the Senate will be able \nto pass this bill promptly. Getting it passed and signed into law will \nhelp to protect our environment and markedly improve the quality of \nlife for millions of Americans--all at a very low cost to the Nation's \ntaxpayers.\n  Mr. President, I ask for unanimous consent that the text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 48\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. REAUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS FOR NEW JERSEY \n                   COASTAL HERITAGE TRAIL ROUTE.\n\n       (a) Reauthorization.--Section 6 of Public Law 100-515 (16 \n     U.S.C. 1244 note) is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (b)(1), by striking ``$4,000,000'' and \n     all that follows and inserting ``such sums as are \n     necessary''; and\n       (2) in subsection (c), by striking ``10'' and inserting \n     ``12''.\n       (b) Strategic Plan.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 2 years after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the Interior shall \n     prepare a strategic plan for the New Jersey Coastal Heritage \n     Trail Route.\n       (2) Contents.--The strategic plan shall describe--\n       (A) opportunities to increase participation by national and \n     local private and public interests in the planning, \n     development, and administration of the New Jersey Coastal \n     Heritage Trail Route; and\n       (B) organizational options for sustaining the New Jersey \n     Coastal Heritage Trail Route.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. STEVENS (for himself and Ms. Murkowski):\n  S. 49. A bill to establish a joint Federal-State Floodplain and \nErosion Mitigation Commission for the State of Alaska; to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Senator \nMurkowski, I introduce S. 49, the Alaska Floodplain and Erosion \nMitigation Commission Act.\n  For the last several years, we have seen coastal river flooding and \nerosion destroy homes, public buildings, and runways, threatening the \ntraditional lifestyle of our Alaska Native people and rural residents. \nOver 100 feet of land can be lost in a single storm, with homes and \nbuildings literally being washed into the ocean.\n  Last year, the Federal Emergency Management Agency was called in \nafter one storm and assessed millions of dollars in damages.\n  In Alaska, there are over 213 communities that have been identified \nas being affected by erosion, 4 of which are in imminent danger and \nwill be forced to relocate.\n  Given the devastating impacts of erosion on Alaska Native villages, I \nheld a full 2-day Appropriations field hearing in July of 2004. Senator \nConrad Burns of Montana, Senator John Sununu of New Hampshire, and \nSenator Lisa Murkowski were all in attendance.\n  Testifying at the hearing were witnesses from the Federal Government, \nState of Alaska, and representatives from the villages most affected by \ncoastal erosion and flooding.\n  These hearings examined the findings and recommendations from the \nGovernment Accounting Office, GAO, report on the severe flooding and \nerosion problems faced in many Native Alaska villages. Congress had \npreviously directed GAO to study flooding and erosion of Alaska Native \nvillages and to determine the extent to which these villages are \naffected, identify Federal and State flooding and erosion programs, \ndetermine the current status of\n\n[[Page S236]]\n\nefforts to respond to flooding and erosion in nine villages, and \nidentify alternatives that Congress may wish to consider when providing \nassistance for flooding and erosion.\n  This bill is a culmination of the GAO report and the field hearings I \nhave mentioned. It will focus the efforts of the Federal agencies and \nthe State of Alaska to better serve the impacted Native villages and \nrural residents. This bill is intended to provide relief for these \ncommunities. It is going to be a very difficult problem to solve.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 49\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize and strengthen the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration's tsunami detection, forecast, warning, and \nmitigation program, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I introduce the Tsunami Preparedness \nAct with my friend and distinguished colleague, Senator Ted Stevens, in \nour new capacities as Co-Chair and Chair of the Commerce Committee. Our \nbill today provides a scientific and technological response to minimize \nthe threats posed by tsunami to our own shores, and the coastal \ncommunities of the world, as exemplified by the appalling scope of the \nIndian Ocean tragedy. The bill builds on our work to establish a system \nin the Pacific that is a model for the world, and also provides for its \nexpansion and improvement to repair gaps that have been identified \nrecently.\n  Protecting human life and property from natural disaster requires the \nability to reliably detect and forecast, the capacity to broadcast \nwarnings in a timely and informative manner, and the knowledge in \ncommunities of how to respond and evacuate to safety. Above all, \nhowever, it requires the willingness to invest resources to prepare for \na threat that is largely unseen and unpredictable until the last \nmoment, when a monstrous wave actually strikes.\n\n[[Page S238]]\n\n  The people of Alaska and Hawaii have long memories of the threat of \ntsunami. Perhaps it is because Hawaii sits in a position of terrible \nvulnerability in the Pacific Ocean, which is the site of 85 percent of \nthe world's tsunami activity, and because Alaska, perched on the \nnorthern edge of the Pacific's Ring of Fire, suffers frequent tsunami-\ngenerating earthquakes.\n  In order to protect local communities, Hawaii established in 1949 a \ntsunami warning center, following a tragic Hilo tsunami. In response to \nthe Good Friday earthquake and tsunami of 1964, which accounted for 90 \npercent of the deaths in the state that year, Alaska followed suit by \nestablishing an observatory in Palmer, Alaska, in 1967. Collaborations \nbetween the two centers and other partners led to a nascent capacity \nfor predicting and warning coastal communities about potential tsunami \nin Alaska and Hawaii and beyond.\n  As we came to understand the broader threat that tsunami posed, Ted \nStevens and I worked together to pass legislation in 1994 to direct the \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to develop a \nTsunami Hazard Mitigation Program.\n  We are pleased to report that the program has laid the foundation for \ntsunami preparedness. Through its Pacific Marine Environmental \nLaboratory (PMEL), NOAA has developed Deep ocean Assessment and \nReporting of Tsunami--or ``DART''--buoys, which accurately measure the \nsubtle variations in the ocean's sea level caused by tsunami traveling \nover open water. With these measurements, as well as readings from \ncoastal gauges, the mathematical models PMEL and others have developed \ncan forecast tsunami direction, speed, and inundation with astonishing \naccuracy. Although the worldwide network of seismic sensors operated by \nthe U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) provides excellent notice of \nearthquakes with the potential to generate tsunami, the DART buoys \nrepresent a next-generation approach to detection and forecasting of \ntsunami that will form the backbone of our domestic preparedness.\n  Interpreting these data and issuing warnings are Hawaii's Pacific \nTsunami Warning Center, and Alaska's West Coast/Alaska Tsunami Warning \nCenter, which jointly have the capacity to cover our domestic shores, \nand, at the same time, to reach out to all cooperating nations of the \nworld.\n  Forecasting and warning networks, however, depend on ears who know \nhow to respond, and so the Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Program has \npartnered with states and local authorities to produce inundation \nmapping, develop evacuation routes, and conduct tsunami education. As a \nresult of much hard work, fifteen counties up and down the west coast, \nand in Alaska and Hawaii have become national and world leaders by \nbecoming ``tsunami ready.''\n  The appalling scope of the Indian Ocean tragedy illustrates the \nimportance and necessity of our work of the past ten years, and with \nstark clarity, we can see that despite our best efforts, much remains \nto be done. Now, as before, Senator Stevens and I have come together to \nlead the charge toward national and international tsunami preparedness.\n  Our legislation today formally authorizes NOAA to establish, operate, \nand maintain a dependable national tsunami warning system that would \nprovide maximum tsunami detection capability for the nation. The system \nwould build on the model established in the Pacific, and provide for \nits repair, expansion and modernization by the close of calendar year \n2007. The system would include four components: an expanded and \nupgraded detection and warning system, a federal-state tsunami hazard \nmitigation program, a tsunami research program, and a modernization and \nupgrade program. In addition, the bill would direct NOAA to provide any \nnecessary technical or other assistance to international efforts to \nestablish regional systems in other parts of the world, including the \nIndian Ocean.\n  The detection and warning system established by the bill would cover \nthe Pacific Ocean region, as well as the Atlantic-Caribbean-Gulf of \nMexico region, and incorporate a variety of seismic and tsunami \ndetection technologies, including deep ocean buoys, as well as \nencompass tsunami warning centers charged with collecting and analyzing \nthe data and distributing warnings--including the existing Pacific \nTsunami Warning Center in Hawaii and the West Coast/Alaska Tsunami \nWarning Center in Alaska, as well as any others deemed necessary by the \nNOAA Administrator.\n  The bill also formally authorizes NOAA's Tsunami Hazard Mitigation \nProgram and its community-based tsunami hazard mitigation program to \nimprove tsunami preparedness of at-risk areas. The bill directs a \nFederal-State coordinating committee for the program, consisting \n(FEMA), the United States Geological Survey (USGS), the National \nScience Foundation (NSF), and affected coastal states and territories, \nto work together to improve inundation mapping, community outreach and \neducation, and promote and integrate tsunami warning and mitigation \nmeasures, including rescue and recovery guidelines. The program would \nprovide grants to states to ensure the program elements are implemented \nin coastal communities.\n  The bill also requires NOAA to establish, along with other agencies \nand academic institutions, a tsunami research program to continuously \nimprove detection, prediction, communication, and mitigation science \nand technology to support tsunami forecasts and warnings. This program \nwould also focus on the potential for improved communications systems \nfor tsunami and other hazard warnings, including telephones, wireless \nand satellite technology, the Internet, television and radio, and any \ninnovative combination of these technologies.\n  A critical component of the bill requires NOAA to upgrade and \nmodernize the U.S. tsunami detection system by December 2007, as well \nas provide accountability for the long-term operation of the system. \nNOAA is required to repair and upgrade the system, ensuring deployment \nof existing deep ocean detection buoys and related detection equipment, \nas well as notify Congress upon any equipment or system failures that \nwill impair regional detection, and of significant contractor failures \nor delays. In addition, the bill calls for the National Academy of \nSciences to review the system for further modernization \nrecommendations.\n  The bill recognizes the need for global coordination on tsunami \npreparedness, requiring NOAA, and the interagency coordinating \ncommittee of the U.S. Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Program, to provide \ntechnical assistance and advice to international entities as part of an \ninternational effort to develop a fully functional global tsunami \nwarning system.\n  Finally, the bill authorizes $35 million annually for six years to \nsupport these activities. Through this legislation, the work Senator \nStevens and I started over ten years ago will step up to the next \nlevel, and provide our nation with coverage and protection that it \nneeds, while fulfilling our duties as citizens of the global community.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 50\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Tsunami Preparedness Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Tsunami are a series of large waves of long wavelength \n     created by the displacement of water by violent undersea \n     disturbances such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, \n     landslides, explosions, and the impact of cosmic bodies.\n       (2) Tsunami have caused, and can cause in the future, \n     enormous loss of human life, injury, destruction of property, \n     and economic and social disruption in coastal and island \n     communities.\n       (3) While 85 percent of tsunami occur in the Pacific Ocean, \n     and coastal and island communities in this region are the \n     most vulnerable to the destructive results, tsunami can occur \n     at any point in any ocean or related body of water where \n     there are earthquakes, volcanoes, or any other activity that \n     displaces a large volume of water.\n       (4) A number of States and territories are subject to the \n     threat of tsunamis, including Alaska, California, Hawaii, \n     Oregon, Washington, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the \n     Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. \n     Virgin Islands.\n\n[[Page S239]]\n\n       (5) The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is \n     responsible for maintaining a tsunami detection and warning \n     system for the Nation, issuing warnings to United States \n     communities at risk from tsunami, and preparing those \n     communities to respond appropriately, through--\n       (A) the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Ewa Beach, \n     Hawaii, which serves as a warning center for Hawaii, all \n     other United States assets in the Pacific, and Puerto Rico;\n       (B) the Alaska/West Coast Tsunami Warning Center in Palmer, \n     Alaska, which is responsible for issuing warnings for Alaska, \n     British Columbia, California, Oregon, and Washington;\n       (C) the Federal-State national tsunami hazard mitigation \n     program;\n       (D) a tsunami research and assessment program, including \n     programs conducted by the Pacific Marine Environmental \n     Laboratory;\n       (E) the TsunamiReady Program, which educates and prepares \n     communities for survival before and during a tsunami; and\n       (F) other related programs.\n       (6) The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration \n     also represents the United States as a member of the \n     International Coordination Group for the Tsunami Warning \n     System in the Pacific, administered by the Intergovernmental \n     Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO, for which the Pacific \n     Tsunami Warning Center acts as the operational center and \n     shares seismic and water level information with 26 member \n     states, and maintains UNESCO's International Tsunami \n     Information Center, in Honolulu, Hawaii, which provides \n     technical and educational assistance to member states.\n       (7) The Tsunami Warning Centers receive seismographic \n     information from the Global Seismic Network, an international \n     system of earthquake monitoring stations, from the United \n     States Geological Survey National Earthquake Information \n     Center, and from cooperative regional seismic networks, and \n     use these data to issue tsunami warnings and integrate the \n     information with data from their own tidal and deep ocean \n     monitoring stations, to cancel or verify the existence of a \n     damaging tsunami. Warnings are disseminated by the National \n     Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to State emergency \n     operation centers.\n       (8) Current gaps in the International Tsunami Warning \n     System, such as the lack of regional warning systems in the \n     Indian Ocean, the southwest Pacific Ocean, Central and South \n     America, the Mediterranean Sea, and Caribbean, pose risks for \n     coastal and island communities.\n       (9) The tragic and extreme loss of life experienced by \n     countries in the Indian Ocean following the magnitude 9.0 \n     earthquake and resulting tsunami in that region on December \n     26, 2004, illustrates the destructive consequences which can \n     occur in the absence of an effective tsunami warning and \n     notification system.\n       (10) An effective tsunami warning and notification system \n     is part of a multi-hazard disaster warning and preparedness \n     program and requires near real-time seismic, sea level, and \n     oceanographic data, high-speed data analysis capabilities, a \n     high-speed tsunami warning communication system, a sustained \n     program of education and risk assessment, and an established \n     local communications infrastructure for timely and effective \n     dissemination of warnings to activate evacuation of tsunami \n     hazard zones.\n       (11) The Tsunami Warning System for the Pacific is a model \n     for other regions of the world to adopt, and can be expanded \n     and modernized to increase detection, forecast, and warning \n     capabilities for vulnerable states and territories, reduce \n     the incidence of costly false alarms, improve reliability of \n     measurement and assessment technology, and increase community \n     preparedness.\n       (12) Tsunami warning and preparedness capability can be \n     developed in other vulnerable areas of the world, such as the \n     Indian Ocean, by identifying tsunami hazard zones, educating \n     populations, developing alert and notification communications \n     infrastructure, and by deploying near real-time tsunami \n     detection sensors and gauges, establishing hazard \n     communication and warning networks, expanding global \n     monitoring of seismic activity, encouraging the increased \n     exchange of seismic and tidal data between nations, and \n     improving international coordination when a tsunami is \n     detected.\n       (13) UNESCO has recognized the need to establish tsunami \n     warning systems for regions beyond the Pacific Basin that are \n     vulnerable to tsunami, including the Indian Ocean, and has \n     convened a working group to lead an effort to expand the \n     International Tsunami Warning System in the Pacific to such \n     vulnerable regions.\n       (14) The international community and all vulnerable nations \n     should take coordinated efforts to establish and participate \n     in regional tsunami warning systems and other hazard warnings \n     systems developed to meet the goals of the United Nations \n     International Strategy for Disaster Reduction.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to improve tsunami detection, forecast, warnings, \n     notification, preparedness, and mitigation in order to \n     protect life and property both in the United States and \n     elsewhere in the world;\n       (2) to improve and modernize the existing Pacific Tsunami \n     Warning System to increase coverage, reduce false alarms and \n     increase accuracy of forecasts and warnings, and expand \n     detection and warning systems to include other vulnerable \n     States and United States territories, including the \n     Caribbean/Atlantic/Gulf region;\n       (3) to increase and accelerate mapping, modeling, research, \n     assessment, education, and outreach efforts in order to \n     improve forecasting, preparedness, mitigation, response, and \n     recovery of tsunami and related coastal hazards;\n       (4) to provide technical and other assistance to speed \n     international efforts to establish regional tsunami warning \n     systems in vulnerable areas worldwide, including the Indian \n     Ocean; and\n       (5) to improve Federal, State, and international \n     coordination for tsunami and other coastal hazard warnings \n     and preparedness.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Any such \n     payments or reimbursements shall be considered a \n     reimbursement to the appropriated funds of the \n     Administration.\n\n     SEC. 8. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated to the \n     Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \n     Administration $35,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2006 \n     through 2012 to carry out this Act.\n                                 \n  Mr. President, the Tsunami Preparedness Act, S. 50, will authorize \nmuch of the work that Senator Inouye and I have done on the \nAppropriations Committee. It establishes a National Tsunami Hazard \nMitigation Program in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration. The recent\n\n[[Page S241]]\n\nevents in Indonesia reminds us all how critical it is to have a strong \ndetection network and warning system for coastal communities. Currently \nthere are 15 communities from Alaska, the west coast and Hawaii that \nare ``Tsunami Ready'', a certification by NOAA that the community has a \ncommunication and coordination plan in case of a Tsunami event.\n  The Tsunami Preparedness Act provides the essential component of any \nwarning system--a program for outreach and education to inform \npotentially Tsunami-impacted communities and for these coastal areas to \nplan accordingly.\n  I have worked closely with Senator Inouye on this legislation and it \nis an example of how we plan to coordinate on bills from the Commerce \nCommittee. This legislation also represents the importance of tsunami \ndetection and early warning for our States, both of which have \nexperienced deadly tsunamis in the past and are ever vigilant to remain \nprepared for future possible events.\n\n  The administration released its plan for an improved tsunami \nmonitoring system on January 14, 2005, committing $37.5 million to \nimproving early detection and warning of tsunami events. The \nadministration's proposal is a good one and this bill will build on \nmany of the commitments made in their plan. In addition, the bill \nimproves the federal coordination and dissemination of tsunami \ninformation and research. It establishes a multi-agency task force \nconsisting of representatives from NOAA, FEMA, USGS, NSF and \npotentially impacted coastal states and territories.\n  The tsunami preparedness act will expand tsunami research, and \nconsistently upgrade and maintain the improved system, which would \ncover the Pacific and Atlantic-Caribbean-Gulf of Mexico regions. In an \neffort to lend help internationally, the bill also directs NOAA to \nassist other countries that could be impacted by tsunamis and build on \nthe United States efforts to establish an international earth observing \nsystem.\n  It is a pleasure to work with my good friend from Hawaii on this \nimportant legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INOUYE:\n  S. 58. A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to permit former \nmembers of the Armed Forces who have a service-connected disability \nrated as total to travel on military aircraft in the same manner and to \nthe same extent as retired members of the Armed Forces are entitled to \ntravel on such aircraft; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing a bill which is \nof great importance to a group of patriotic Americans. This legislation \nis designed to extend space-available travel privileges on military \naircraft to those who have been totally disabled in the service of our \ncountry.\n  Currently, retired members of the Armed Services are permitted to \ntravel on a space-available basis on non-scheduled military flights \nwithin the continental United States, and on scheduled overseas flights \noperated by the Military Airlift Command. My bill would provide the \nsame benefits for veterans with 100 percent service-connected \ndisabilities.\n  We owe these heroic men and women who have given so much to our \ncountry a debt of gratitude. Of course, we can never repay them for the \nsacrifices they have made on behalf of our Nation, but we can surely \ntry to make their lives more pleasant and fulfilling. One way in which \nwe can help is to extend military travel privileges to these \ndistinguished American veterans. I have received numerous letters from \nall over the country attesting to the importance attached to this issue \nby veterans. Therefore, I ask that my colleagues show their concern and \njoin me in saying ``thank you'' by supporting this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 58\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. TRAVEL ON MILITARY AIRCRAFT OF CERTAIN DISABLED \n                   FORMER MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Chapter 53 of title 10, United States \n     Code, is amended by inserting after section 1060b the \n     following new section:\n\n     ``Sec. 1060c. Travel on military aircraft: certain disabled \n       former members of the armed forces\n\n       ``The Secretary of Defense shall permit any former member \n     of the armed forces who is entitled to compensation under the \n     laws administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs for a \n     service-connected disability rated as total to travel, in the \n     same manner and to the same extent as retired members of the \n     armed forces, on unscheduled military flights within the \n     continental United States and on scheduled overseas flights \n     operated by the Air Mobility Command.

A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to authorize \ncertain disabled former prisoners of war to use Department of Defense \ncommissary and exchange stores; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing legislation to \nenable those former prisoners of war who have been separated honorably \nfrom their respective services and who have been rated as having a 30 \npercent service-connected disability to have the use of both the \nmilitary commissary and post exchange privileges. While I realize it is \nimpossible to adequately compensate one who has endured long periods of \nincarceration at the hands of our Nation's enemies, I do feel this \ngesture is both meaningful and important to those concerned because it \nserves as a reminder that our Nation has not forgotten their \nsacrifices.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 59\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to repeal the provision of law that provides automatic \npay adjustments for Members of Congress; to the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to reintroduce legislation \nthat would put an end to automatic cost-of-living adjustments for \ncongressional pay.\n  As I have noted when I raised this issue in past years, it is an \nunusual thing to have the power to raise our own pay. Most of our \nconstituents do not have that power. And that this power is so unusual \nis good reason for the Congress to exercise that power openly, and to \nexercise it subject to regular procedures that include debate, \namendment, and a vote on the record.\n  I regret to say, that current law permits Congress to avoid that \npublic debate and vote. All that is necessary for Congress to get a pay \nraise is that\n\n[[Page S242]]\n\nnothing be done to stop it. The annual pay raise takes effect unless \nCongress acts.\n  This stealth pay raise mechanism began with a change Congress enacted \nin the Ethics Reform Act of 1989. In section 704 of that act, Members \nof Congress voted to make themselves entitled to an annual raise equal \nto half a percentage point less than the employment cost index, one \nmeasure of inflation.\n  It is true, that on occasion Congress has voted to deny itself the \nraise, and the traditional vehicle for the pay raise vote is the \nTreasury appropriations bill. But that vehicle is not always made \navailable to those who want a public debate and vote on the matter. \nJust last year, for example, the Treasury appropriations bill was \nslipped into the massive Omnibus Appropriations conference report, and \nthus it was completely shielded from amendment. Senators were \neffectively prevented from offering an amendment to force an up or down \nvote on the annual pay raise. And that situation was not unique.\n  Getting a vote on the annual congressional pay raise is a haphazard \naffair at best, and it should not be that way. The burden should not be \non those who seek a public debate and recorded vote on the Member pay \nraise. On the contrary, Congress should have to act if it decides to \naward itself a hike in pay. This process of pay raises without \naccountability must end.\n  This issue is not a new question. It was something that our Founders \nconsidered from the beginning of our Nation. In August 1789, as part of \nthe package of 12 amendments advocated by James Madison that included \nwhat has become our Bill of Rights, the House of Representatives passed \nan amendment to the Constitution providing that Congress could not \nraise its pay without an intervening election. On September 9, 1789, \nthe Senate passed that amendment. In late September 1789, Congress \nsubmitted the amendments to the States.\n  Although the amendment on pay raises languished for two centuries, in \nthe 1980s, a campaign began to ratify it. While I was a member of the \nWisconsin State Senate, I was proud to help ratify the amendment. Its \napproval by the Michigan Legislature on May 7, 1992, gave it the needed \napproval by three-fourths of the States.\n  The 27th amendment to the Constitution now states: ``No law, varying \nthe compensation for the services of the senators and representatives, \nshall take effect, until an election of representatives shall have \nintervened.''\n  I try to honor that limitation in my own practices. In my own case, \nthroughout my 6-year term, I accept only the rate of pay that Senators \nreceive on the date on which I was sworn in as a Senator. And I return \nto the Treasury any additional income Senators get, whether from a \ncost-of-living adjustment or a pay raise we vote for ourselves. I don't \ntake a raise until my bosses, the people of Wisconsin, give me one at \nthe ballot box. That is the spirit of the 27th amendment. The stealth \npay raises like the one that Congress allowed last year, at a minimum, \ncertainly violate the spirit of that amendment.\n  This practice must end. This bill will end it. Senators and \nCongressmen should have to vote up-or-down to raise congressional pay. \nMy bill would simply require us to vote in the open. We owe our \nconstituents nothing less.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 60\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide improved reimbursement for clinical social worker services \nunder the medicare program; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \namend Title XVIII of the Social Security Act to correct discrepancies \nin the reimbursement of clinical social workers covered through \nMedicare, Part B. The three proposed changes contained in this \nlegislation clarify the current payment process for clinical social \nworkers and establish a reimbursement methodology for the profession \nthat is similar to other health care professionals reimbursed through \nthe Medicare program.\n  First, this legislation sets payment for clinical social worker \nservices according to a fee schedule established by the Secretary. \nSecond, it explicitly states that services and supplies furnished by a \nclinical social worker are a covered Medicare expense, just as these \nservices are covered for other mental health professionals in Medicare. \nThird, the bill allows clinical social workers to be reimbursed for \nservices provided to a client who is hospitalized.\n  Clinical social workers are valued members of our health care \nprovider network. They are legally regulated in every state of the \nnation and are recognized as independent providers of mental health \ncare throughout the health care system. It is time to correct the \ndisparate reimbursement treatment of this profession under Medicare.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 61\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

IMPROVED REIMBURSEMENT FOR CLINICAL SOCIAL WORKER \n                   SERVICES UNDER MEDICARE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 1833(a)(1)(F)(ii) of the Social \n     Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395l(a)(1)(F)(ii)) is amended to \n     read as follows: ``(ii) the amount determined by a fee \n     schedule established by the Secretary,''.\n       (b) Definition of Clinical Social Worker Services \n     Expanded.--Section 1861(hh)(2) of the Social Security Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 1395x(hh)(2)) is amended by striking ``services \n     performed by a clinical social worker (as defined in \n     paragraph (1))'' and inserting ``such services and such \n     services and supplies furnished as an incident to such \n     services performed by a clinical social worker (as defined in \n     paragraph (1))''.\n       (c) Clinical Social Worker Services Not to Be Included in \n     Inpatient Hospital Services.--Section 1861(b)(4) of the \n     Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395x(b)(4)) is amended by \n     striking ``and services'' and inserting ``clinical social \n     worker services, and services''.\n       (d) Treatment of Services Furnished in Inpatient Setting.--\n     Section 1832(a)(2)(B)(iii) of the Social Security Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 1395k(a)(2)(B)(iii)) is amended by striking ``and \n     services'' and inserting ``clinical social worker services, \n     and services''.\n       (e) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to payments made for clinical social worker \n     services furnished on or after January 1, 2006.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INOUYE:\n  S. 62. A bill for the relief of Jim K. Yoshida; to the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I am introducing a private relief \nbill on behalf of Jim K. Yoshida, to obtain recognition of his service \nwith the U.S. military in Korea so that he may obtain veteran's status.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 62\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Yoshida of Honolulu, \n     Hawaii, as a volunteer member of the United\n\n[[Page S243]]\n\n     States Army during the period beginning on July 2, 1950, and \n     ending on January 17, 1951, shall be deemed to be active \n     military service from which Jim K. Yoshida was discharged \n     under honorable conditions for the purposes of all laws \n     administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs.\n       (c) Prospective Applicability.--No benefits may be paid or \n     otherwise provided to Jim K. Yoshida of Honolulu, Hawaii, by \n     reason of the enactment of this Act with respect to any \n     period before the date of the enactment of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself and Mr. Domenici):\n  S. 63. A bill to establish the Northern Rio Grande National Heritage \nArea in the State of New Mexico, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce legislation \nto establish the Northern Rio Grande National Heritage Area in northern \nNew Mexico. I am pleased that Senator Domenici is again joining me in \nsponsoring this bill. The Northern Rio Grande National Heritage Area \nwill be established as part of a collaborative effort between local \nresidents, Indian tribes, businesses and local governments, who are \nworking together to preserve the area.\n  By establishing the Northern Rio Grande National Heritage Area, I \nhope to commemorate the significant but complex heritage of northern \nNew Mexico communities and Indian tribes, from the pre-Spanish \ncolonization period to present day. Establishing a National Heritage \nArea will benefit the northern New Mexico communities, local residents, \nstudents, and visitors, as well as help the local protection and \ninterpretation of the unique cultural, historical, and natural \nresources of northern New Mexico.\n  Last Congress, identical legislation passed the Senate by unanimous \nconsent and again as part of a comprehensive heritage area bill. The \nHouse of Representatives amended the bill to add authorizations for \nother heritage areas but unfortunately the different versions were not \nable to be reconciled prior to the sine die adjournment of the \nCongress. However, I am encouraged that the Senate and House have each \napproved authorization for the Northern Rio Grande National Heritage \nArea, and it is my hope that since both Houses have now passed \nlegislation that is essentially identical to the bill I am introducing \ntoday, it can be swiftly considered and enacted into law.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 63\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Northern Rio Grande National \n     Heritage Area Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) northern New Mexico encompasses a mosaic of cultures \n     and history, including eight Pueblos and the descendants of \n     Spanish ancestors who settled in the area in 1598;\n       (2) the combination of cultures, languages, folk arts, \n     customs, and architecture make northern New Mexico unique;\n       (3) the area includes spectacular natural, scenic, and \n     recreational resources;\n       (4) there is broad support from local governments and \n     interested individuals to establish a National Heritage Area \n     to coordinate and assist in the preservation and \n     interpretation of these resources;\n       (5) in 1991, the National Park Service study Alternative \n     Concepts for Commemorating Spanish Colonization identified \n     several alternatives consistent with the establishment of a \n     National Heritage Area, including conducting a comprehensive \n     archaeological and historical research program, coordinating \n     a comprehensive interpretation program, and interpreting a \n     cultural heritage scene; and\n       (6) establishment of a National Heritage Area in northern \n     New Mexico would assist local communities and residents in \n     preserving these unique cultural, historical and natural \n     resources.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       As used in this Act--\n       (1) the term ``heritage area'' means the Northern Rio \n     Grande Heritage Area; and\n       (2) the term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of the \n     Interior.\n\n     SEC. 4.

I also want to thank my colleague in the other chamber, \nCongressman Jim Gibbons, for his leadership on this issue and for \nintroducing the companion version of this bill.\n  This bill will abolish the Federal Aviation Administration's Age 60 \nRule-the regulation that for more than 40 years has forced the \nretirement of airline pilots the day they turn 60 and replace it with a \nrational plan that ties the commercial pilot retirement age to the \nSocial Security retirement age currently 65.\n  Most nations have abolished mandatory age 60 retirement rules. The \nUnited States is one of only two countries in the Joint Aviation \nAuthority that requires its commercial pilots to retire at the age of \n60. Some countries, including Canada, Australia, and New Zealand have \nno upper age limit at all.\n  The Age 60 Rule has no basis in science or safety and never did. FAA \ndata shows that pilots over age 60 are as safe as, and in some cases \nsafer than, their younger colleagues. There have been numerous studies \nand statements in support of abolishing the Age 60 Rule.\n  In 1981, the National Institute of Aging stated that ``the Age 60 \nRule appears indefensible on medical grounds'' and ``there is no \nconvincing medical evidence to support age 60, or any other specific \nage, for mandatory pilot retirement.''\n  The FAA released the Hilton Study in 1993, which stated ``the data \nfor all groups of pilots were remarkably consistent in showing a modest \ndecrease in accident rate with age no hint of an increase in accident \nrates as pilots near age 60.''\n  Furthermore, in May 1999, the Senate Appropriations Committee asked \nthe FAA to report on why the US should not cautiously increase the age \nto 63, ``like other countries have for commercial aviation.''\n  Airline Pilots magazine stated in a September 2003 article, ``If a \npermanent replacement for the 30 year Treasury bond rate is also \napplied to the calculation of lump-sum payments, we recommend a long \ntransition period, similar to that proposed in H.R. 1776, the pension \nlegislation introduced by Rep. Bob Portman. For pilots who must retire \nat age 60, this is particularly important. It would be unfair to pull \nthe rug out from under employees who have carefully planned their \nretirement finances, especially pilots who can't fly longer to make up \nfor the amounts lost because of a change in the basis used to calculate \nlump-sum payments.''\n  As recently as September 14, 2004, in a hearing before the Senate \nSpecial Committee on Aging, Captain Joseph ``Ike'' Eichelkraut, \nPresident of Southwest Airlines Pilots' Association, testified:\n  ``The 4400 plus pilots of the Southwest Airlines Pilots' Association, \noppose the Age 60 Rule.\n  ``Flying a commercial airliner is not the physically demanding \nenvironment I encountered 15 years ago in the 7 9 ``G'' world of the F-\n16 I flew in the Air Force. Commercial piloting is, however, a job \nrequiring key management skills and sound judgment. These are talents \nthat I have found typically come with age and experience.\n  ``The facts are that plain. The FAA has the ideal mechanisms for \nensuring safe pilots at any age are already in place. To retain my \nlicense and fly as a pilot for Southwest Airlines, I must pass semi-\nannual flight physicals administered by a qualified (FAA licensed) \nAero-Medical Examiner (AME). When a pilot turns 40 years of age, he \nmust undergo an EKG every other flight physical, which is \nelectronically transmitted by the AME directly to FAA headquarters \nwhere a computer program alerts if parameters dictate.\n  ``Pilots must also successfully pass semiannual simulator training \nand flight checks designed to evaluate the crewmember's ability to \nrespond to various aircraft emergencies and/or competently handle \nadvances in flight technology and the Air Traffic Control (ATC) \nenvironment. Captains must demonstrate, twice yearly, complete \nknowledge of systems and procedures, safe piloting skills and multi-\ntasking by managing emergency and normal flight situations, typically \nin instrument flight conditions conducted in advanced simulators. There \nis no greater test of cognitive ability and mental dexterity than these \nsimulator rides. Flight crews are also administered random inflight \ncheck rides by FAA inspectors and Southwest check airmen. Further, we \nare subject to random alcohol and drug testing at any time while on \nduty. There is no other profession examined to this level. The 59 year \nold Captain arrives at this point in his career having demonstrated \nsuccessful performance following years of this kind of scrutiny. FAA \nstudies have verified the superior level of safety exhibited by this \nsenior Captain.\n  ``At Southwest, our pilots are trained to fly the aircraft on \ninstruments down to 50\u007f above the ground in poor visibility conditions \nbefore acquiring the intended runway and landing visually. In \nsimulators, both pilots must demonstrate the ability to immediately \ndetermine whether a safe landing can be made at this point and then \neither execute a ``go-around'' or land. The First Officer is trained to \nassume control of the aircraft and execute a ``go-around'' if the \nCaptain fails to respond to procedures at this critical decision point. \nIf either pilot should become incapacitated, even at touchdown, the \nother pilot is capable of assuming control in order to fly the airplane \nto a safe landing. The passengers would probably remain unaware that a \npilot had become ill until the aircraft is met at the gate by Emergency \nMedical Technicians (EMT).\n  ``Simulator failure rates among SWA pilots are low. Last year there \nwere only 31 out of 4,200 simulator checkrides. But as pilots approach \nage 60 the failure numbers are at their lowest. The graph attached \nshows this and I believe that experience is the key. As pilots get \nolder, they know how to better handle the extreme situations they may \nhave encountered in simulator checks. The mean failure rate declines at \nan even rate from a pilot's thirties through his fifties. Of course, \nbecause of the Age 60 rule, I don't have data to\n\n[[Page S245]]\n\nshow that this trend would continue throughout a pilot's sixties, but I \nsuspect it would.''\n  I urge the Commerce Committee to hold hearings along these lines.\n  Furthermore, on September 29, 2004, thousands of people watched as \n63-year-old Michael Melvill made history by becoming the first civilian \nto pilot a craft into space. In doing so, he helped Paul Allen, the \nowner of Mojave Aerospace Ventures, which owns SpaceShipOne technology, \nalong with the designer of SpaceShipOne, Burt Rutan, win the coveted \n$10 million Ansari X-Prize.\n  Melvill took SpaceShipOne above the 62-mile altitude point, \nultimately soaring to 337,500 feet. Despite rolling nearly 30 times, \nMelvill was able to gain control of the vehicle, re-enter the \natmosphere, and glide to a landing. I attribute this recovery and \nsubsequent landing to Melvill's years of extensive experience as a test \npilot.\n  This bill will allow our most experienced pilots, those like Michael \nMelvill demonstrably healthy, and fit for duty-to retain their jobs, a \nstep that will benefit pilots, the financially burdened airlines, and \nmost importantly, passengers. Now, more than ever before, we need to \nkeep our best pilots flying.\n  Again, there is no scientific justification for requiring pilots to \nretire at age 60. Our pilots, our airlines, and our passengers deserve \nour consideration. I urge the rest of my colleagues to support this \nimportant legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INOUYE:\n  S. 66. A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for coverage of services provided by nursing school clinics \nunder medicaid programs; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I introduce the Nursing School \nClinics Act. This measure builds on our concerted efforts to provide \naccess to quality health care for Americans by offering grants and \nincentives for nursing schools to establish primary care clinics in \nunderserved areas where additional medical services are most needed. In \naddition, this measure provides the opportunity for nursing schools to \nenhance the scope of student training and education by providing \nfirsthand clinical experience in primary care facilities.\n  Primary care clinics administered by nursing schools are university \nor nonprofit primary care centers developed mainly in collaboration \nwith university schools of nursing and the communities they serve. \nThese centers are staffed by faculty and staff who are nurse \npractitioners and public health nurses. Students supplement patient \ncare while receiving preceptorships provided by college of nursing \nfaculty and primary care physicians, often associated with academic \ninstitutions, who serve as collaborators with nurse practitioners. To \ndate, the comprehensive models of care provided by nursing clinics have \nyielded excellent results, including significantly fewer emergency room \nvisits, fewer hospital inpatient days, and less use of specialists, as \ncompared to conventional primary health care.\n  This bill reinforces the principle of combining health care delivery \nin underserved areas with the education of advanced practice nurses. To \naccomplish these objectives, Title XIX of the Social Security Act would \nbe amended to designate that the services provided in these nursing \nschool clinics are reimbursable under Medicaid. The combination of \ngrants and the provision of Medicaid reimbursement furnishes the \nfinancial incentives for clinic operators to establish the clinics.\n  In order to meet the increasing challenges of bringing cost-effective \nand quality health care to all Americans, we must consider a wide range \nof proposals, both large and small. Most importantly, we must approach \nthe issue of health care with creativity and determination, ensuring \nthat all reasonable avenues are pursued. Nurses have always been an \nintegral part of health care delivery. The Nursing School Clinics Act \nrecognizes the central role nurses can perform as care givers to the \nmedically underserved.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord. \n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 66\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Public Health Act to provide health care \npractitioners in rural areas with training in preventive health care, \nincluding both physical and mental care, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Rural \nPreventive Health Care Training Act, a bill that responds to the dire \nneed of our rural communities for quality health care and disease \nprevention programs. Almost one fourth of Americans live in rural areas \nand frequently lack access to adequate physical and mental health care. \nAs many as 21 million of the 34 million people living in underserved \nrural areas are without access to a primary care provider. Even in \nareas where providers do exist, there are numerous limits to access, \nsuch as geography, distance, lack of transportation, and lack of \nknowledge about available resources. Due to the diversity of rural \npopulations, language and cultural obstacles are often a factor in the \naccess to medical care.\n  Compound these problems with limited financial resources, and the \nresult is that many Americans living in rural communities go without \nvital health care, especially preventive care. Children fail to receive \nimmunizations and routine checkups. Preventable illnesses and injuries \noccur needlessly, and lead to expensive hospitalizations. Early \nsymptoms of emotional problems and substance abuse go undetected, and \noften develop into full-blown disorders.\n  An Institute of Medicine IOM report entitled, ``Reducing Risks for \nMental Disorders: Frontiers for Preventive Intervention Research,'' \nhighlights the benefits of preventive care for all health problems. The \ntraining of health care providers in prevention is crucial in order to \nmeet the demand for care in underserved areas. Currently, rural health \ncare providers lack preventive care training opportunities.\n  Interdisciplinary preventive training of rural health care providers \nmust be encouraged. Through such training, rural health care providers \ncan build a strong educational foundation from the behavioral, \nbiological, and psychological sciences. Interdisciplinary team \nprevention training will also facilitate operations at sites with both \nhealth and mental health clinics by facilitating routine consultation \nbetween groups. Emphasizing the mental health disciplines and their \nservices as part of the health care team will contribute to the overall \nhealth of rural communities.\n  The Rural Preventive Health Care Training Act would implement the\n\n[[Page S246]]\n\nrisk-reduction model described in the IOM study. This model is based on \nthe identification of risk factors and targets specific interventions \nfor those risk factors. The human suffering caused by poor health is \nimmeasurable, and places a huge financial burden on communities, \nfamilies, and individuals. By implementing preventive measures to \nreduce this suffering, the potential psychological and financial \nsavings are enormous.\n  Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 67\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nprovide 100 percent reimbursement for medical assistance provided to a \nNative Hawaiian through a federally-qualified health center or a Native \nHawaiian health care system; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I introduce the Native Hawaiian \nMedicaid Coverage Act. This legislation would authorize a Federal \nMedicaid Assistance Percent (FMAP) of 100 percent for the payment of \nhealth care costs of Native Hawaiians who receive health care from \nFederally Qualified Health Centers or the Native Hawaiian Health Care \nSystem.\n  This bill was originally a provision within the Medicare Prescription \nDrug Bill, which the Senate passed by an overwhelming majority of 76 to \n21, but was dropped from the final Medicare Prescription Drug \nConference Report.\n  This bill is modeled on the Native Alaskan Health Care Act, which \nprovides for a Federal Medicaid Assistance Percent (FMAP) of 100 \npercent for payment of health care costs for Native Alaskans by the \nIndian Health Service, an Indian tribe, or a tribal organization.\n  Community health centers serve as the ``safety net'' for uninsured \nand medically underserved Native Hawaiians and other United States \ncitizens, providing comprehensive primary and preventive health \nservices to the entire community. Outpatient services offered to the \nentire family include comprehensive primary care, preventive health \nmaintenance, and education outreach in the local community. Community \nhealth centers, with their multidisciplinary approach, offer cost \neffective integration of health promotion and wellness with chronic \ndisease management and primary care focused on serving vulnerable \npopulations.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 68\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Box, the now-\ndeceased mother of Donald C. Pence. It is rare that a federal agency \nadmits a mistake. In this case, the Department of Veterans Affairs has \nadmitted that a mistake was made and explored ways to permit payment \nunder the law, including equitable relief, but has found no provision \nauthorizing the Department to release the remaining benefits that were \nunpaid to Mrs. Box at the time of her death. My bill would correct this \ninjustice, and I urge my colleagues to support this measure.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 69\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I introduce legislation to authorize \nthe autonomous functioning of clinical psychologists and clinical \nsocial workers within the Medicare comprehensive outpatient \nrehabilitation facility program.\n  In my judgment, it is unfortunate that Medicare requires clinical \nsupervision of the services provided by certain health professionals \nand does not allow them to function to the full extent of their State \npractice licenses. Those who need the services of outpatient \nrehabilitation facilities should have access to a wide range of social \nand behavioral science expertise. Clinical psychologists and clinical \nsocial workers are recognized as independent providers of mental health \ncare services under the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program, the \nTRICARE Military Health Program of the Uniformed Services, the Medicare \n(Part B) Program, and numerous private insurance plans. This \nlegislation will ensure that these qualified professionals achieve the \nsame recognition under the Medicare comprehensive outpatient \nrehabilitation facility program.\n\n[[Page S247]]\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 70\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for patient protection by limiting the number of mandatory \novertime hours a nurse may be required to work at certain medicare \nproviders, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I introduce the Registered Nurse \nSafe Staffing Act. I am introducing this bill on behalf of the American \nNurses Association's Chief Executive Officer and President Linda \nStierle, MSN, RN, CNAA and Barbara A. Blakeney, MS, APRN, BC, ANP, \nrespectively. For over four decades I have been a committed supporter \nof nurses and the delivery of safe patient care. While enforceable \nregulations will help to ensure patient safety, the complexity and \nvariability of today's hospitals require that staffing patterns be \ndetermined at the hospital and unit level, with the professional input \nof registered nurses. More than a decade of research demonstrates that \nnurse staff levels and the skill mix of nursing staff directly affect \nthe clinical outcomes of hospitalized patients. Studies show that when \nthere are more registered nurses, there are lower mortality rates, \nshorter lengths of stay, reduced costs, and fewer complications.\n  A study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association \nfound that the risks of patient mortality rose by 7 percent for every \nadditional patient added to the average nurse's workload. In the midst \nof a nursing shortage and increasing financial pressures, hospitals \noften find it difficult to maintain adequate staffing. While nursing \nresearch indicates that adequate registered nurse staffing is vital to \nthe health and safety of patients, there is no standardized public \nreporting mechanism, nor enforcement of adequate staffing plans. The \nonly regulations addressing nursing staff exists vaguely in Medicare \nConditions of Participation which states: ``The nursing service must \nhave an adequate number of licensed registered nurses, licensed \npractice (vocational) nurse, and other personnel to provide nursing \ncare to all patients as needed''.\n  This bill will require Medicare Participating Hospitals to develop \nand maintain reliable and valid systems to determine sufficient \nregistered nurse staffing. Given the demands that the healthcare \nindustry faces today, it is our responsibility to ensure that patients \nhave access to adequate nursing care. However, we must ensure that the \ndecisions by which care is provided are made by the clinical experts, \nthe registered nurses caring for these patients. Support of this bill \nsupports our nation's nurses during a critical shortage, but more \nimportantly, works to ensure the safety of their patients.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 71\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Registered Nurse Safe \n     Staffing Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) There are hospitals throughout the United States that \n     have inadequate staffing of registered nurses to protect the \n     well-being and health of the patients.\n       (2) Studies show that the health of patients in hospitals \n     is directly proportionate to the number of registered nurses \n     working in the hospital.\n       (3) There is a critical shortage of registered nurses in \n     the United States.\n       (4) The effect of that shortage is revealed in unsafe \n     staffing levels in hospitals.\n       (5) Patient safety is adversely affected by these unsafe \n     staffing levels, creating a public health crisis.\n       (6) Registered nurses are being required to perform \n     professional services under conditions that do not support \n     quality health care or a healthful work environment for \n     registered nurses.\n       (7) As a payer for inpatient and outpatient hospital \n     services for individuals entitled to benefits under the \n     medicare program established under title XVIII of the Social \n     Security Act, the Federal Government has a compelling \n     interest in promoting the safety of such individuals by \n     requiring any hospital participating in such program to \n     establish minimum safe staffing levels for registered nurses.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to promote food safety and to protect the animal feed \nsupply from bovine spongiform encephalopathy; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Animal Feed \nProtection Act of 2005. It is similar to legislation that I introduced \nin the 108th Congress.\n  Last week, during the Senate's consideration of the nomination of \nGovernor Mike Johanns to be the Secretary of Agriculture, I spoke in \nfavor of exercising caution with respect to re-opening the U.S.-\nCanadian border to imports of live animals and processed beef products \nuntil the Animal Protective Health Inspection Service fully \ninvestigates the most recent case of Mad Cow in that country. This \nlegislation is important to our ongoing efforts to eradicate the \npossibility that Mad Cow disease will infect U.S. cattle herds.\n  My legislation provides necessary enhancements to current Federal \nfeed regulations. It reduces the chance that the riskiest materials, \nthose most likely to transmit Mad Cow disease, cross-contaminate cattle \nfeed or are accidentally fed to cattle.\n  Specifically, my legislation would ban the inclusion of specified \nrisk materials, or SRM, in all animal feed. Currently these materials \nare only banned from ruminant feed.\n  As we continue to negotiate the reopening of export markets to U.S. \nbeef, a comprehensive SRM ban is a prudent step. It is necessary to \nassure our trading partners that we have secured our domestic feed, and \neliminated the risk of spreading Mad Cow disease through feed.\n  As our domestic beef producers continue to suffer from the closure of \nour largest export markets, I encourage my colleagues to join me by \ncosponsoring this legislation--a measure that will strengthen our Mad \nCow firewalls and our assurances to foreign beef consumers. I also hope \nthat as the Senate Agriculture Committee conducts hearings next month \ninto the appropriate Federal response to the most recent Canadian Mad \nCow case, the committee will consider examining this legislation as \nwell. The Senate should move toward its swift passage. Mr. President, I \nask unanimous consent that a copy of the legislation be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 73\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to designate a portion of the White Salmon River as a \ncomponent of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, today I am introducing the White Salmon \nWild and Scenic Rivers Act. I am pleased to be joined by the Senior \nSenator from Washington (Mrs. Murray), who has been a strong supporter \nof this legislation.\n  This bill would designate some 20 miles of the main stem of the upper \nWhite Salmon River Salmon and one of its tributaries, Cascade Creek, \nall within the Gifford Pinchot National Forest, as components of the \nNational Wild and Scenic Rivers System. By designating this upper third \nof the White Salmon, we can permanently protect this special river as a \npremiere recreational destination, a Southwest Washington economic \nresource, and an important wildlife habitat.\n  I am happy to note that my delegation colleague, Congressman Baird, \nrecently offered identical legislation in the House.\n  The White Salmon River's remarkable beauty and pristine condition are \nnot in question. In fact, the lower eight miles of the river received \nprotection when Congress granted that stretch of the river Wild and \nScenic status in 1986. As we saw then, its protected status hasn't \nprevented residents and visitors from taking advantage of the unique \nrecreational opportunities the White Salmon River offers. Extending \nWild and Scenic protection to the river's upper reaches today is an \nimportant step forward in protecting even more of its wild character \nfor fishing, boating, and other recreational activities.\n  As one of the best whitewater rivers in the Pacific Northwest, the \nWhite Salmon already supports a number of whitewater rafting companies. \nAbout 12,000 whitewater boaters visit the river each year. So I see \nthis designation as not just protecting a pristine river, but also its \nbeneficial impact on the local economy downstream.\n  Protecting the White Salmon River will help increase opportunities \nfor other outdoor sports, as well. This is an important sector of our \nstate's economy. According to the Washington Department of Fish and \nWildlife, fish and wildlife related recreation pumps nearly $2.2 \nbillion per year into our economy. And we rank first in the Northwest \nand eighth in the nation in spending by sport fishers.\n  Safeguarding the White Salmon through this designation will also be \nan important step toward restoring wildlife habitat. Once the Condit \nDam is removed from the lower reach of the river, the White Salmon will \nagain become valuable spawning habitat for salmon and steelhead.\n  I am proud that identical legislation to the measure I introduce \ntoday passed the Senate unanimously on October 10, 2004. While the bill \nnarrowly missed clearing the House of Representatives, I am confident \nthat because this bill has a broad range of support, and is a true win-\nwin proposal for local interests, that it will become law during the \n109th Congress.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to working with my colleagues in the \nSenate, as well as other members of the Washington state congressional \ndelegation, to ensure swift passage of this important legislation. I \nask unanimous consent that a copy of the legislation be printed in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 74\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Upper White Salmon Wild and \n     Scenic Rivers Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. UPPER WHITE SALMON WILD AND SCENIC RIVER.\n\n       Section 3(a) of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (16 U.S.C. \n     1274(a)) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       `` ( ) White Salmon River, Washington.--The 20 miles of \n     river segments of the main stem of the White Salmon River and \n     Cascade Creek, Washington, to be administered by the \n     Secretary of Agriculture in the following classifications:\n       ``(A) The approximately 1.6-mile segment of the main stem \n     of the White Salmon River from the headwaters on Mount Adams \n     in section 17, township 8 north, range 10 east, downstream to \n     the Mount Adams wilderness boundary as a wild river.\n       ``(B) The approximately 5.1-mile segment of Cascade Creek \n     from its headwaters on Mount Adams in section 10, township 8 \n     north, range 10 east, downstream to the Mount Adams \n     Wilderness boundary as a wild river.\n       ``(C) The approximately 1.5-mile segment of Cascade Creek \n     from the Mount Adams Wilderness boundary downstream to its \n     confluence with the White Salmon River as a scenic river.\n       ``(D) The approximately 11.8-mile segment of the main stem \n     of the White Salmon River from the Mount Adams Wilderness \n     boundary downstream to the Gifford Pinchot National Forest \n     boundary as a scenic river.''.\n\n     SEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as are \n     necessary to carry out this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. CANTWELL:\n  S. 75. A bill to permanently increase the maximum annual contribution \nallowed to be made to Coverdell education savings accounts; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, today I am introducing two pieces of \nlegislation to help families save for their children's education.\n  In today's global marketplace, ensuring access to high-quality \neducation--starting in early childhood and grade school, moving on to \ncollege and beyond--is central in maintaining America's competitive \nedge. To make paying for school easier, I am introducing two pieces of \nlegislation that would expand Coverdell Education Savings Accounts or \nESAs: The Education Savings for Students Act and College Savings Act.\n  Coverdell ESAs are trusts created solely for the educational benefit \nof any child under the age of 18. Contributions to a Coverdell \nEducation Savings account can be used toward a child's education from \nkindergarten through 12th grade, college, and even graduate school. All \nearnings in the account grow tax-free and can be withdrawn on a tax-\ndeferred basis, if used for educational expenses. Currently, annual \ncontributions to each Coverdell ESA cannot exceed $2,000. But this \nparticular provision will sunset on 12/31/2010 unless Congress takes \naction to extend it, otherwise the maximum contribution will drop back \nto a previously set stipulation of $500.\n  My bill, the Education for Students Act would expand the existing \nCoverdell ESA by permanently increasing the maximum annual contribution \nfrom $2,000 to $5,000. This bill keeps the current Coverdell ESA \nprovision that investment earnings accumulate tax-free and withdrawals \nfrom the account are tax-exempt when the child uses the funds for \nschool.\n  My other bill, the College Savings Act would also permanently \nincrease the maximum annual contribution to a Coverdell ESA to $5,000. \nInstead of anticipating future earnings, families would be able to \ndeduct the amount they contribute to their education savings account \nfrom income.\n  Rather than putting away money ad-hoc, both bills provide a financial \nincentive to save for college or other educational expenses. And since \nthere is no limit on the number of Coverdell ESAs that may be opened \nfor a child under age 18, parents have the flexibility to set aside \nmoney now through deductible contributions or bank on projected savings \nthrough tax-deferred earnings and withdrawals, or even take on both \noptions. The College Savings and Education Savings for Students Acts \nwill help families plan for future educational expenses, paving a path \nto financial self-sufficiency.\n  I understand that all families are different. Saving for college may \nbe the last thing on a parent's mind, especially when their child is \nyoung and their family has significant financial needs. But just as \nfast as our children\n\n[[Page S251]]\n\ngrow, so does the cost of tuition. Mounting prices for books and \nmaterials, plus room and board have made colleges and universities less \naffordable for most families.\n  College is expensive. There are many parents whose children aim to go \nto college, but soon discover they can't afford it because the price of \npursuing a higher education costs too much. If the College Savings and \nEducation for Students Acts became law, families would have another \npowerful tool to help their children realize their educational dreams.\n  By saving money early and often, families won't feel as hard hit by \nskyrocketing college prices because you'll know what's coming in and \nwhat's going out of these accounts.\n  In 2002, the National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education \nreported on the national trends of rising college prices. The Center \ndetermined that if educational costs are unaddressed there will be \nadverse consequences for expanding students' opportunities to pursue a \nhigher education and future career.\n  This report found that over the last two decades, the cost of \nattending two- and four-year public and private colleges have not only \ngrown more rapidly than inflation, but faster than family incomes, \nincreasing the share of family income that is needed to pay for tuition \nand other college expenses. From 1991 through 2001, tuition at four-\nyear public colleges and universities rose faster than family income in \n41 states, including my home state of Washington.\n  The Washington State Higher Education Coordinating Board reports \nthat, over the last ten years, tuition and fees have far outpaced \nfamily income, increasing 89 percent compared to 51 percent in per \ncapita personal income in my state. In comparison, the cost of most \nconsumer goods increased an average of 20 percent during the same time. \nPer capita personal income in Washington increased 51 percent during \nthis same period.\n  As a result, more students and families at all income levels are \nborrowing more money than ever before to pay for college. According to \na recent study by the College Board, nonfederal borrowing reached $11.3 \nbillion in 2003-04, up 39 percent over the previous year, and jumping \nnearly 150 percent in three years. Over $10 billion of these loans are \nprivate. Over the past five years, borrowing through banks and other \nprivate lenders has increased from 7 percent to 16 percent of education \nloan volume.\n  Although borrowing is an acceptable way to pay for college, the \nfinancial consequences of high debt can still ensue, and students spend \nyears paying back loans, undermining their ability to purchase a home \nor save for retirement. Additionally, college students on average \ngraduate with about $3,300 in credit card debit alone. Concern about \nthe increase in educational loan debt may cause students to spend more \ntime working than attending class or to opt out of enrolling in college \naltogether.\n  Moreover, the steepest increases in college and university tuition \nhave been imposed during times of greatest economic hardship. Just in \nthe past three years, our economy has experienced a loss of 1.8 million \nprivate sector jobs and 2.7 million manufacturing jobs. Preparing \nAmerica's workforce and keeping up with the demand for skilled workers \nacross all sectors of the 21st century economy is my priority. If we \nwant to maintain our economic competitiveness, it is imperative that \nthere are opportunities for individuals to fully take advantage of \neducational opportunities.\n  The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that six of the ten fastest-\ngrowing occupations in the U.S. economy require an associate's degree \nor bachelor's degree, and that all ten of these careers will require \nsome type of skills training. By 2010, 40 percent of all job growth \nwill require some form of post-secondary education.\n  On average, a college graduate earns nearly 73 percent more than a \ntypical high school graduate. In 2003, the average worker in the U.S. \nwith a four-year college degree earned just under $50,000, over 60 \npercent more than the $30,800 earned by the average worker with a high \nschool diploma, reports the College Board. Those with advanced degrees \nearn two to three times as much as high school graduates. In addition, \nsociety reaps the benefits of an educated workforce by improving \nquality of life and overall, the well-being of our communities.\n  Affordability is key to expanding opportunities to go to college. \nSaving for college early and often will help lift the pressures off of \nparents who are feeling the financial squeeze of increased tuition and \nfees.\n  Because my family qualified for financial aid, I was able to work my \nway through college using Pell grant funding. But there are many \nfamilies who do not qualify for Pell or other sources of financial aid.\n  For these families, Coverdell Education Savings plans provide \nnecessary relief for the middle class. The purpose of education savings \nplans are to increase saving by increasing net returns. Today, parents \ncan put up to $2,000 a year into a Coverdell Education Savings account. \nThe actual contribution is not tax deductible, but all earnings in this \naccount are free from taxes when they are withdrawn to pay for school.\n  However, the current $2,000 annual limit on Coverdell contributions \nwill be repealed in 2010 unless Congress acts to extend it. If we don't \nextend the contribution level, the maximum contribution will drop to \n$500.\n  While the current tax benefit makes it easier to save for college, \nthe Education Savings for Students Act would increase the annual \ncontributions from $2,000 to $5,000; making this change permanent \nensures greater savings for families. By increasing the amount parents \ncan put aside for their children's college savings, middle-income \nparents will be able to save more easily for their child's college \neducation.\n  Say, for example, parents start saving when their child turns eight \nyears old. If they put away just $100.00 a month--at an interest rate \nof savings of four percent--by the time their kid turns 18, their \naccount would have earned more than $12,400 in interest. Parents will \nsave over $3,100 in taxes when that child is old enough to go to \nschool.\n  In addition to projected savings, parents also have the option to \nsave now. The College Savings Act would allow families to deduct \nCoverdell ESA contributions from their taxes each year.\n  Mr. President, both of these bills, the College Savings Act and the \nEducation Savings for Students Act are financial incentives for people \nto save by allowing families to deduct the amount they contribute and \ntake tax-free earnings when their child is ready to go to school. These \nbills would further lessen the financial burden that parents bear by \nsaving money early and often.\n  Permanently expanding the Coverdell maximum contribution from its \ncurrent threshold of $2,000 to $5,000 a year and allowing this \ncontribution to be tax deductible is a common-sense savings vehicle \nthat keeps future college costs from spinning out of control. \nIncreasing contribution caps will make school more affordable at a time \nwhen a college education and advanced job training is becoming more and \nmore important for economic success.\n  I urge my colleagues to support these measures and I ask unanimous \nconsent that the full text of these bills be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bills was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 75\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend titles 10 and 38, United States Code, to \nimprove death benefits for the families of deceased members of the \nArmed Forces, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Armed \nServices.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes to discuss \nlegislation that I offer today along with Senator Lieberman and I \nbelieve 15 other cosponsors called the HEROES Act of 2005, the Honoring \nEvery Requirement of Exemplary Service Act, that will increase \nsubstantially the death benefits provided to the families of our \nservice personnel who lose their lives in service to their country. I \nsee Senator Allen. I know he deeply cares about this issue. We are \nworking together on this same idea.\n  Fundamentally, this bill would raise the basic death benefit from \n$12,420 to $100,000. It will raise the servicemen's group life \ninsurance payment from $250,000 to $400,000. Senator Lieberman and I, \nall of us in this body believe we need to make sure that our \nservicemen's families are well taken care of if something were to \nhappen to them.\n  I am very pleased that Senator Frist on Friday made this part of his \nleadership package and that Senator John Warner, chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee, promised quick action in the committee on the \nsubject. And I am very pleased that the Defense Department has worked \nwith us in helping to craft this legislation, actually supports it and \nthe funding it will require.\n  I asked last year about it when our defense bill moved. When no \nconsensus was reached as that bill was moving, we put in the \nlegislation a requirement that the DOD work with the Congress to \ndevelop a plan to improve death benefits, and they have done so. It is \nthe right thing to do.\n  Just last Monday, I was in Iraq. I had the ability to travel \nthroughout that country, and we flew back from Baghdad to Kuwait about \n9 or 10 that night. On the C-130 in which we flew back, in the bay of \nthat great aircraft were two flag-draped coffins of American service \npersonnel who had given their life to their country. There should be no \ndoubt in any soldier's mind that if something happens to them while in \nservice to their country, their family will be well taken care of. The \nAmerican people want that. I believe the people in this Congress will \nsupport that.\n  This legislation needs to be passed promptly. I am proud that Senator \nWarner and Senator Frist have indicated they would accelerate it and do \nwhat they can to see that it does become law. I look forward to working \nwith Senator Lieberman and my fellow Senators to move this bill to \nfinal passage.\n  I see the chairman of Armed Services, Senator Warner. I express my \nappreciation to him for his commitment to do what he can to move this \nbill forward promptly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his thoughtful \nremarks. I so commit to do that.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, America's finest citizens and the world's \ngreatest military men and women continue to put themselves in harm's \nway in support of the establishment of freedom and democracy in Iraq \nand Afghanistan. They also are helping millions throughout South and \nSoutheast Asia to recover from the devastating tsunami that destroyed \nso many lives.\n  These great Americans have made a commitment to serve this country \ncome what may. They are prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice with \nthe knowledge that in doing so, they are defending the security of our \nNation and advancing the very ideals upon which this great country was \nfounded.\n  Just as these men and women have agreed to make this commitment, so \ntoo must we commit to supporting the families of these soldiers who \ngive the ``last full measure of devotion'' for us. It is the very least \nwe can do to provide a greater degree of peace of mind to our service \nmen and women, who should always know and trust that a grateful America \nwill stand with and support their family members should tragedy strike.\n  It is in recognition of their extraordinary selflessness that I join \nmy colleagues, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Lieberman and others in cosponsoring \nthe HEROES Act of 2005. Although Congress last year raised the amount \noffered to families following the death of a service man or woman for \nthe first time in over a decade, I continue to believe that even that \namount is an inadequate level of support in this day and age.\n  For decades, we offered a nominal amount of between $800 and $3,000, \ndepending upon rank, for immediate expenses to surviving family members \nupon the death of a member of our armed forces. In the wake of the 1991 \nGulf War, Congress raised this to a flat $6,000, of which half was \nsubject to income tax. Finally, we raised that to $12,000, made the \nentire amount tax-free, and tied future increases to the annual \nincrease in base pay.\n  Of course, no amount of money can replace the loved ones that are \nlost in combat. It's an unimaginable loss which can never be \nameliorated by financial comfort. However, despite the increase in the \nlevel of support last year, the amount that we currently offer the \nfamilies of our soldiers remains woefully inadequate to try to begin to \naddress the immediate costs of funeral arrangements, the loss of what \nmay in most cases be the primary wage earner in the family and the \nadditional costs associated with the loss of a mother, father, or \nspouse.\n  When one considers how long it may take for a family to regain its \nfooting, how surviving family members may need to move out of military-\nprovided housing and to secure private housing elsewhere, how a \nsurviving spouse may need to search for employment to support his or \nher family, and how long it may take for insurance benefits to be paid \nout, this improvement in benefits is the very least we can do to \nalleviate the burdens and financial worry that come with such a loss.\n  I strongly support raising the amount to $100,000, in addition to \nincreasing the maximum benefit of the Servicemen's Group Life Insurance \npolicy from $250,000 to $400,000, as this bill does.\n  In acknowledgment of and appreciation for the sacrifices of our brave \nmen and women in uniform, I hope that we can all agree on the need to \nhelp ensure that the futures of their children are secured should they \nsacrifice their lives in combat.\n  It is for the sake of our brave servicemen and women and the families \nwho depend on them that we introduce this legislation and for them that \nI urge full support.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. HUTCHISON (for herself, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. \n        Bunning, Mr. Burns, Mr. Hagel, and Mr. Ensign):\n  S. 78. A bill to make permanent marriage penalty relief; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Ms. HUTCHISON. Mr. President I am pleased to introduce a bill to \nprovide\n\n[[Page S254]]\n\npermanent tax relief from the marriage penalty--the most egregious, \nanti-family provision that has been in the tax code. One of my highest \npriorities in the U.S. Senate has been to relieve American taxpayers of \nthis punitive burden.\n  Over the past four years we have made important strides to eliminate \nthis unfair tax and provide marriage penalty relief by raising the \nstandard deduction and enlarging the 15 percent tax bracket for married \njoint filers to twice that of single filers. Before these provisions \nwere changed, 44 million married couples, including 2.4 million Texas \nfamilies, paid an average penalty of $1,480.\n  Enacting marriage penalty relief has been a giant step for tax \nfairness, but it may be fleeting. Even as married couples use the money \nthey now save to put food on the table and clothes on their children, a \ntax increase looms in the future. Since the 2001 tax relief bill was \nrestricted, the marriage penalty provisions will only be in effect \nthrough 2010. In 2011, marriage will again be a taxable event and 43 \npercent of married couples will again pay more in taxes unless we act \ndecisively.\n  Given the challenges many families face in making ends meet, we must \nmake sure we do not backtrack on this important reform.\n  The benefits of marriage are well established, yet, without marriage \npenalty relief, the tax code provides a significant disincentive for \npeople to walk down the aisle. Marriage is a fundamental institution in \nour society and should not be discouraged by the IRS. Children living \nin a married household are far less likely to live in poverty or to \nsuffer from child abuse. Research indicates they are less likely to be \ndepressed or have developmental problems. Scourges such as adolescent \ndrug use are less common in married families, and married mothers are \nless likely to be victims of domestic violence.\n  We should celebrate marriage, not penalize it. The bill I am offering \nwould make marriage penalty relief permanent, because we cannot be \nsatisfied until couples never again must decide between love and money. \nMarriage should not be a taxable event.\n  I call on the Senate to finish the job we started to make marriage \npenalty relief permanent today.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 78\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am reintroducing legislation today that \nwould direct the Secretary of the Army to determine whether certain \nnationals of the Philippine Islands performed military service on \nbehalf of the United States during World War II.\n  Mr. President, our Filipino veterans fought side by side with \nAmericans and sacrificed their lives on behalf of the United States. \nThis legislation would confirm the validity of their claims and further \nallow qualified individuals the opportunity to apply for military and \nveterans benefits that, I believe, they are entitled to. As this \npopulation becomes older, it is important for our nation to extend its \nfirm commitment to the Filipino veterans and their families who \nparticipated in making us the great nation that we are today.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 79\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to restore the traditional day of observance of \nMemorial Day, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, in our effort to accommodate many \nAmericans by making Memorial Day the last Monday in May, we have lost \nsight of the significance of this day to our nation. My bill would \nrestore Memorial Day to May 30 and authorize our flag to fly at half \nmast on that day. In addition, this legislation would authorize the \nPresident to issue a proclamation designating Memorial Day and Veterans \nDay as days for prayer and ceremonies. This legislation would help \nrestore the recognition our veterans deserve for the sacrifices they \nhave made on behalf of our Nation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 80\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \ntax relief for the conversion of cooperative housing corporations into \ncondominiums; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation \nwhich would amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nCooperative Housing Corporations (co-ops), to convert to condominium \nforms of ownership.\n  Under current law, a conversion from cooperative shareholding to \ncondominium ownership is taxable at a corporate level as well as an \nindividual level. The conversion is treated as a corporate liquidation, \nand therefore taxed accordingly. In addition, a capital gains tax is \nlevied on any increase between the owner's basis in the co-op share \npre-conversion and the market value of the condominium interest post-\nconversion. This double taxation dissuades condominium conversion \nbecause the owner is being taxed on the transaction which is nothing \nmore than a change in the form of ownership. While the Internal Revenue \nService concedes that there are no discernable advantages to society of \nthe cooperative form of ownership, they do not view federal tax \nstatutes as providing sufficient flexibility with which to address the \nobstacles of conversion.\n  Cooperative housing organizes the ownership structure into a \ncorporation, with shares of stock for each apartment unit, which are \nsold to buyers. The corporation then issues a proprietary lease \nentitling the owner of the stock to the use of the unit in perpetuity. \nBecause the investment is in the form of a share of stock, investors \nsometimes lose their entire investment as a result of debt incurred by \nthe corporation in construction and development. In addition, due to \nthe structure of a cooperative housing corporation, a prospective \npurchaser of shares in the corporation from an existing tenant-\nstockholders has difficulty obtaining mortgage financing for the \npurchase. Furthermore, tenant-stockholders of cooperative housing also \nencounter difficulties in securing bank loans for the full value of \ntheir investment.\n  As a result, owners of cooperative housing are increasingly looking \ntoward conversion to the condominium structure of ownership. \nCondominium ownership permits the owner of a unit to own the unit \nitself, eliminating the cooperative housing dilemma of corporate debt \nthat supercedes the investment of cooperative housing share owners, and \nother financial concerns.\n  The legislation I introduce today will remove the penalty of double \ntaxation from the conversion of cooperative housing to condominium \nownership, and will greatly benefit co-op owners across the nation. The \nbill does not apply to cooperatives which have been or are now being \nfinanced by any federal, state, or local programs for the purpose of \nassisting in the construction of affordable housing cooperatives or the \nconversion of rental units to affordable housing cooperatives. I urge \nmy colleagues' consideration and support for this measure.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 83\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. NONRECOGNITION OF GAIN OR LOSS ON DISTRIBUTIONS BY \n                   COOPERATIVE HOUSING CORPORATIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 216(e) of the Internal Revenue \n     Code of 1986 (relating to distributions by cooperative \n     housing corporations) is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(e) Distributions by Cooperative Housing Corporations.--\n       ``(1) In general.--Except as provided in regulations--\n       ``(A) no gain or loss shall be recognized to a cooperative \n     housing corporation on the distribution by such corporation \n     of a dwelling unit to a stockholder in such corporation if \n     such distribution is in exchange for the stockholder's stock \n     in such corporation, and\n       ``(B) no gain or loss shall be recognized to a stockholder \n     of such corporation on the transfer of such stockholder's \n     stock in an exchange described in subparagraph (A).\n       ``(2) Basis.--The basis of a dwelling unit acquired in a \n     distribution to which paragraph (1) applies shall be the same \n     as the basis of the stock in the cooperative housing \n     corporation for which it is exchanged, decreased in the \n     amount of any money received by the taxpayer in such \n     exchange.\n       ``(3) Applicability.--This subsection shall not apply with \n     respect to any dwelling unit the basis of which includes \n     financing under any Federal, State, or local program for the \n     purpose of assisting the construction of affordable housing \n     cooperatives or the conversion of rental units to affordable \n     housing cooperatives.''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section \n     shall apply to distributions after the date of the enactment \n     of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INOUYE:\n  S. 84. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to exempt \ncertain sightseeing flights from taxes on air transportation; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill that would \namend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to exempt certain sightseeing \nflights from the air transportation excise tax. A clarifying amendment \nto the Tax Code is needed due to a problem that exists in the \napplication of the excise tax.\n  In 1986, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), issued a Private Letter \nRuling in which it exempted one Hawaii-based air tour operator from \npaying the air passenger transportation excise tax, but has not applied \nequal treatment to other similarly situated aerial sightseeing tour \noperators. It is my belief that the IRS should be consistent in its \napplication of this excise tax.\n  Under current law, a variety of excise taxes on air transportation \nare imposed to finance the Airport and Airway Trust funds program that \nis administered by the Federal Aviation Administration. For example, an \nair passenger transportation excise tax is imposed on users of our \nnation's airports and airways. The Congress intended that the tax be \nlevied on passengers traveling on scheduled commercial airlines. In \naddition, for the most part, the tax is imposed on each flight segment.\n  The Congress did not intend to have the tax applied to air tour \noperators, who utilize our system of airways differently. Our national \ntransportation system receives little or no benefit from aerial \nsightseeing operations. Air tour operations are not scheduled \ncommercial airlines. They are for entertainment purposes and are \ncircular, in that they begin and end at the same destination point.\n  Hawaii is among a small handful of states where our citizens can \nenjoy aerial tours of sights that are remote or difficult to reach by \nland. Aerial sightseeing tours are also enjoyed in Alaska, California, \nWashington, Arizona, and even New York City. The imposition of the air \ntransportation excise tax on aerial sightseeing flights will \nsignificantly raise the consumer price on air tours. Doing so will \ncause many small aerial sightseeing tour operators, especially in my \nhome state, to lose customers. Many of these small companies have \nstruggled to stay in business after incurring significant losses in the \nmonths following September 11, 2001, when our government imposed flight \nrestrictions across the nation. Those flight restrictions prevented \nmany flight operations in all segments of the general aviation industry \nfor many months into early 2002.\n  Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to support my bill, which would \namend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to exempt certain sightseeing \ntrips from the air transportation excise tax. Under my bill, air tour \noperations would still be subject to the aviation fuel excise tax.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 84\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. CERTAIN SIGHTSEEING FLIGHTS EXEMPT FROM TAXES ON \n                   AIR TRANSPORTATION.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 4281 of the Internal Revenue Code \n     of 1986 (relating to small aircraft on nonestablished lines) \n     is amended by adding at the end the following new sentence: \n     ``For purposes of this section, an aircraft shall not be \n     considered as operated on an established line if such \n     aircraft is operated on a flight the sole purpose of which is \n     sightseeing.''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section \n     shall apply with respect\n\n[[Page S256]]\n\n     to transportation beginning on or after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, but shall not apply to any amount paid \n     before such date.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INOUYE:\n  S. 87. A bill to recognize the organization known as the National \nAcademies of Practice; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President today I am introducing legislation that \nwould provide a federal charter for the National Academies of Practice. \nThis organization represents outstanding health care professionals who \nhave made significant contributions to the practice of applied \npsychology, medicine, dentistry, nursing, optometry, osteopathic \nmedicine, pharmacy, podiatry, social work, and veterinary medicine. \nWhen fully established, each of the ten academies will possess 150 \ndistinguished practitioners selected by their peers. This umbrella \norganization will be able to provide the Congress of the United States \nand the executive branch with considerable health policy expertise, \nespecially from the perspective of those individuals who are in the \nforefront of actually providing health care.\n  As we continue to grapple with the many complex issues surrounding \nthe delivery of health care services, it is clearly in our best \ninterest to ensure that the Congress has direct and immediate access to \nthe recommendations of an interdisciplinary body of health care \npractitioners.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 87\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I introduce legislation to amend \nTitle 18 of the United States Code to allow our Nation's clinical \nsocial workers to use their mental health expertise on behalf of the \nfederal judiciary by conducting psychological and psychiatric exams.\n  I feel that the time has come to allow our Nation's judicial system \nto have access to a wide range of behavioral science and mental health \nexpertise.

Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation today to \nmodify Title VII of the Public Health Service Act in order to provide \nstudents enrolled in graduate psychology programs with the opportunity \nto participate in various health professions loan programs.\n  Providing students enrolled in graduate psychology programs with \neligibility for financial assistance in the form of loans, loan \nguarantees, and scholarships will facilitate a much-needed infusion of \nbehavioral science expertise into our community of public health \nproviders. There is a growing recognition of the valuable contribution \nbeing made by psychologists toward solving some of our Nation's most \ndistressing problems.\n  The participation of students from all backgrounds and clinical \ndisciplines is vital to the success of health care training. The Title \nVII programs play a significant role in providing financial support for \nthe recruitment of minorities, women, and individuals from economically \ndisadvantaged backgrounds. Minority therapists have an advantage in the \nprovision of critical services to minority populations because often \nthey can communicate with clients in their own language and cultural \nframework. Minority therapists are more likely to work in community \nsettings where ethnic minority and economically disadvantaged \nindividuals are most likely to seek care. It is critical that continued \nsupport be provided for the training of individuals who provide health \ncare services to underserved communities.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 89\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The purpose of this center is to support and \ndisseminate information about basic and clinical social work research, \nand training, with emphasis on service to underserved and rural \npopulations.\n  While the Federal Government provides funding for various social work \nresearch activities through the National Institutes of Health and other \nFederal agencies, there presently is no coordination or direction of \nthese critical activities and no overall assessment of needs and \nopportunities for empirical knowledge development. The establishment of \na Center for Social Work Research would result in improved behavioral \nand mental health care outcomes for our Nation's children, families, \nthe elderly, and others.\n  In order to meet the increasing challenges of bringing cost-\neffective, research-based, quality health care to all Americans, we \nmust recognize the important contributions of social work researchers \nto health care delivery and the central role that the Center for Social \nWork can provide in facilitating their work.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 90\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``National Center for Social \n     Work Research Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) social workers focus on the improvement of individual \n     and family functioning and the creation of effective health \n     and mental health prevention and treatment interventions in \n     order for individuals to become more productive members of \n     society;\n       (2) social workers provide front line prevention and \n     treatment services in the areas of school violence, aging, \n     teen pregnancy, child abuse, domestic violence, juvenile \n     crime, and substance abuse, particularly in rural and \n     underserved communities; and\n       (3) social workers are in a unique position to provide \n     valuable research information on these complex social \n     concerns, taking into account a wide range of social, \n     medical, economic and community influences from an \n     interdisciplinary, family-centered and community-based \n     approach.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend title VII of the Public Health Service Act to \nestablish a psychology post-doctoral fellowship program, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today to \namend Title VII of the Public Health Service Act to establish a \npsychology post-doctoral program. Psychologists have made a unique \ncontribution in reaching out to the nation's medically underserved \npopulations. Expertise in behavioral science is useful in addressing \ngrave concerns such as violence, addiction, mental illness, adolescent \nand child behavioral disorders, and family disruption. Establishment of \na psychology post-doctoral program could be an effective way to find \nsolutions to these issues.\n  Similar programs supporting additional, specialized training in \ntraditionally underserved settings have been successful in retaining \nparticipants to serve the same populations. For example, mental health \nprofessionals who have participated in these specialized federally \nfunded programs have tended not only to meet their repayment \nobligations, but have continued to work in the public sector or with \nthe underserved.\n  While a doctorate in psychology provides broad-based knowledge and \nmastery in a wide variety of clinical skills, specialized post-doctoral \nfellowship programs help to develop particular diagnostic and treatment \nskills required to respond effectively to underserved populations. For \nexample, what appears to be poor academic motivation in a child \nrecently relocated from Southeast Asia might actually reflect a \ncultural value of reserve rather than a disinterest in academic \nlearning. Specialized assessment skills enable the clinician to \ninitiate effective treatment.\n  Domestic violence poses a significant public health problem and is \nnot just a problem for the criminal justice system. Violence against \nwomen results in thousands of hospitalizations a year. Rates of child \nand spouse abuse in rural areas are particularly high, as are the rates \nof alcohol abuse and depression in adolescents. A post-doctoral \nfellowship program in the psychology of the rural populations could be \nof special benefit in addressing these problems.\n  Given the demonstrated success and effectiveness of specialized \ntraining programs, it is incumbent upon us to encourage participation \nin post-doctoral fellowships that respond to the needs of the nation's \nunderserved.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 92\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to increase the role of the Secretary of Transportation \nin administering section 901 of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Senators Leahy, \nLincoln, Dole, and Smith, I rise today to introduce the Good Samaritan \nHunger Relief Tax Incentive Act of 2005. This important legislation \nallows for expanded charitable tax deductions for contributions of food \ninventory to our nation's food banks and would permit farmers and \nbusinesses of all sizes to take advantage of this tax deduction. Demand \non food banks has been rising, and these tax deductions would be an \nimportant step in increasing private donations to the non-profit hunger \nrelief charities playing a critical role in meeting America's \nnutritional needs.\n  To a certain degree, donations have not diminished or have even \nmodestly increased, but most areas surveyed report that donations \ncannot keep up with the growing demand. According to the U.S. \nConference of Mayors and Sodexho USA ``Hunger and Homelessness Survey'' \nreleased in December 2004, requests for emergency food assistance has \nincreased fourteen percent. Fifty-six percent of the people requesting \nemergency food assistance are either children or their parents. The \nnumber of elderly persons requesting food assistance has increased by \ntwelve percent. The success of welfare reform legislation has moved \nmany recipients off welfare and into jobs. Over the last decade, in \nmany states, welfare roles have been reduced by more than one half. But \nwe need to recognize that these individuals and their families are \nliving on modest wages. As the states' unemployment rates have risen, \nso have the demands placed on the food banks and soup kitchens. The \nproblem of hunger goes well beyond the unemployed. The Mayors' survey \npoints out that thirty-four percent of people requesting food \nassistance were working. Due to increases in rent, underemployment, \nmultigenerational residences, families have to make the tough financial \ndecisions. As a result, food needs of families have been pushed further \nand further down the priority list. This is coupled with the \nnutritional value becoming less important to some families because fast \nfood and ``junk'' food is more economical to those on a tight budget.\n  Private food banks provide a key safety net against hunger. According \nto the 2002 report by U.S. Department of Agriculture, over 13 million \nchildren were hungry or at the risk of being hungry.\n  America's Second Harvest, a nationwide umbrella group of over 200 \nfood banks and food rescue organization, released a 2001 report \nentitled ``Hunger in America'' stating that 23.3 million people sought \nand received emergency hunger relief from just their network of \ncharitable organizations. That would be the equivalent of the \npopulations of New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, Philadelphia, \nSan Diego, Phoenix, San Antonio, Dallas, and Detroit combined. In 1997, \nthe USDA estimated that up to 96 billion pounds of food goes to waste \neach year in the United States at a cost of an estimated $1 billion in \nincreased disposal fees paid by municipalities. This is food and fresh \nproduce that is left unharvested or in storage bins, discarded by \nwholesales, restaurants, and grocery stores, or reduced by the \nmanufacturing or transportation process. If a small percentage of this \nwasted food could be redirected to food banks, we could make important \nstrides in our fight against hunger. I believe the enactment of this \nlegislation would be a great incentive in redirecting this food from \nbeing discarded to being distributed to hungry families.\n  The Good Samaritan Hunger Relief Tax Incentive Act would allow \nfarmers and small business owners to take a deduction when they donate \nfood to their community food bank. Currently this reduction is \navailable to large corporations but not for small businesses. This \napproach would stimulate private charitable giving to food banks at the \ncommunity level. Each citizen can make an important contribution to the \nfight against hunger at a local level. Over the years, I have had the \nopportunity to visit numerous Hoosier food banks, and have been \nespecially impressed by the remarkable work of these organizations. In \nmany cases, they are partnered with churches and faith-based \norganizations and are making a tremendous difference in our \ncommunities. We should support this private sector activity, which not \nonly feeds people, but also strengthens community bonds and \ndemonstrates the power of faith, charity, and civic involvement.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself and Mr. DeWine):\n  S. 95. A bill to amend titles 23 and 49, United States Code, \nconcerning length and weight limitations for vehicles operating on \nFederal-aid highways, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Today, I am proud to introduce, along with my \ncolleague Senator DeWine, legislation which will make our roads safer \nand last longer. Our bill, the ``Safe Highways and Infrastructure \nPreservation Act,'' will extend the current limited freeze of current \ntruck size and weight limits set by states, which only applies to our \n44,000-mile Interstate Highway System, to the entire 156,000-mile \nNational Highway System (NHS). This extension will make more roads \nsafer and will further reduce the wear and tear of our highways and \nbridges.\n  Fifteen years ago, I got a provision into the ISTEA highway \nreauthorization bill to ban triple-trailer trucks and other so-called \n``longer combination vehicles'' (LCVs) from New Jersey and most other \nStates. At that time and ever since, the trucking industry has fought \nto defeat and repeal this ban, under the guise of arguments for \n``states' rights'' and ``unfair re-distribution of business to \nrailroads.'' But these are not rational arguments for allowing larger \nand heavier trucks as well as triple-trailer trucks on our roads. \nAdditionally, the trucking industry's proclaimed hardships have not \nmaterialized. In fact, the trucking companies have survived the current \nlaws quite well, and trucks have refined their role in our national \nfreight transportation system.\n  Anyone who has ever shared the road with a large tractor-trailer \ntruck has probably wondered whether the truck driver is aware of the \nsmaller vehicles around the truck. Anyone who has seen the third \ntrailer on a triple-trailer truck swinging around in a 'crack the whip' \nfashion probably knows that these trucks are to be avoided.\n  Moving to the use of even larger trucks is not safe. The U.S. \nDepartment of Transportation has determined that multi-trailer trucks \nare likely to be involved in more fatal crashes--11 percent more than \ntoday's single-trailer trucks. By expanding the limits on triples and \nother longer combination\n\n[[Page S261]]\n\nvehicles to the entire NHS including more than 2,000 miles of highway \nin New Jersey the Safe Highways and Infrastructure Protection Act will \nsave lives and prevent further deterioration of our roads and bridges.\n  The State of New Jersey sees its share of the nation's truck traffic. \nAnd we are concerned about recent projections that show the amount of \ntraffic increasing considerably over the next 10 to 20 years. We are \nconcerned about these 53-foot, 80,000-pound vehicles on our highways \nand the pressure from other states to increase weight and length \nlimitations to allow larger trucks to come through our State. This \nmakes truck safety even more important to New Jersey drivers.\n  Triple-trailers and other LCVs do more damage to our roads and \nbridges but don't come close to paying associated maintenance and \nrepair costs. Currently, some 37 percent of bridges in New Jersey are \nconsidered structurally deficient or functionally obsolete. Their \naverage age is 42 years old. But the fees, tolls, and gasoline taxes \npaid by the operator of a 100,000-pound truck only covers 40 percent of \nthe cost of the damage that truck does to our roads and bridges; \ntaxpayers make up the difference. I believe that motorists should not \nhave to share the road with these dangerous behemoths and pay for the \nextra damage they cause.\n  In the 108th Congress, the Senate passed portions of this legislation \nin the highway reauthorization legislation package. I believe that if \nwe act to pass this legislation, we can make a big difference in the \nlives of people who share our highways with large truck traffic.\n  I thank my colleague Senator DeWine for once again joining me in \nsponsoring this important legislation, and I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues in the Congress to improve highway safety and \nincrease the remaining life of our country's roads and bridges.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord.\n  (The bill will be printed in a future edition of the Record.)\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INHOFE:\n  S. 96. A bill to target Federal funding for research and development, \nto amend section 1928 of the Social Security Act to encourage the \nproduction of influenza vaccines by eliminating the price cap \napplicable to the purchase of such vaccines under contracts entered \ninto by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, to amend the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 to establish a tax credit to encourage \nvaccine production capacity, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I have long been dedicated to quality \nhealthcare for my constituents in Oklahoma and across America. I \nsupported the Medicare bill of 2003 to give a voluntary prescription \ndrug benefit to seniors. I have championed the rural health care \nproviders, who received some of the greatest benefits of the Medicare \nbill. In 1997, I was one of few Republican to vote against the Balanced \nBudget Act because of its lack of support for rural hospitals. Back \nthen, I made a commitment to not allow our rural hospitals to be \nclosed, and I am pleased we finally addressed that important issue in \nthe Medicare legislation. I also co-sponsored S. 816, the Health Care \nAccess and Rural Equity Act, to protect and preserve access of Medicare \nbeneficiaries to health care in rural regions.\n  I am a strong advocate of medical liability reform and am an original \ncosponsor of S. 11, the Patients First Act, to protect patients' access \nto quality and affordable health care by reducing the effects of \nexcessive liability costs. There are solutions to alleviate the burden \nplaced on physicians and patients by excessive medical malpractice \nlawsuits, and I am committed to this vital reform.\n  I have also worked with officials from the Center for Medicare and \nMedicaid Services to expand access to life-saving Implantable Cardiac \nDefibrillators. I supported legislation to increase the supply of \npancreatic islet cells for research and co-sponsored a bill to take the \nabortion pill RU-486 off the market in the United States.\n  The Federal Government invests in improving hospitals and healthcare \ninitiatives, and I have fought hard to ensure that Oklahoma gets its \nfair share. Specifically, over the past three years, I have helped to \nsecure $5.2 million in funding for the Oklahoma Medical Research \nFoundation, the Oklahoma State Department of Health planning initiative \nfor a rural telemedicine system, the INTEGRIS Healthcare System, the \nUniversity of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, the Oklahoma Center for \nthe Advancement of Science and Technology, St. Anthony's Heart \nHospital, the Hillcrest Healthcare System, and the Morton Health \nCenter.\n  Mr. President, the unexpected influenza (flu) vaccine shortage \nbeginning last month highlights the need to encourage the production of \nflu vaccine in America. As you know, on October 5, 2004, Chiron, a \nCalifornia-based biotechnology company, notified U.S. health officials \nthat its plant in Liverpool, England had been shut down due to vaccine \ncontamination. Almost 50,000 doses of flu vaccine were thrown away, \nwhich created a severe shortage for Americans just as the flu season \nbegan.\n  In light of the current shortage, I have examined why America found \nitself unable to accommodate the public demand for the flu vaccine. As \nwe have seen, once a vaccine shortage strikes, a rapid response is \ndifficult and often impossible. Thirty years ago, more than a dozen \nAmerican companies were in the flu vaccine business. Today, only two \ncompanies make the vaccine for America, and only one is an America-\nbased company. This is no coincidence. High liability costs, tedious \nproduction, price caps, and the complicated United States tax code have \nkept the market bare.\n  In October, President Bush signed the JOBS bill, which curbed the \nbillion-dollar lawsuits that have crippled the flu vaccination \nindustry. By adding flu vaccine to the list of vaccines protected by \nthe National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP), a no-fault \nalternative must be used for resolving vaccine injury claims. I am \nencouraged with this progress, but more can be done to prevent a \nshortage in the future.\n  The FY2005 Omnibus bill provides $100 million to the Department of \nHealth and Human Services (HHS) to ensure a year-round flu vaccine \nproduction capacity and for the development of rapidly expandable flu \nvaccine production technologies. The Omnibus language also permits HHS \nto purchase flu vaccine with these funds, if deemed necessary. Such \ncostly purchasing is a waste of federal dollars that could otherwise be \nused for research through the National Institutes of Health to develop \nfaster and safer vaccine production technology. My bill strikes the \nlanguage that allows government purchasing of the flu vaccine with \nthese funds.\n  Optimizing the flu vaccine production process is imperative. The \never-changing nature of the flu virus results in a complicated \nproduction process. The dominant strain of the flu virus mutates each \nyear, requiring a different vaccine for every flu season. Because \nharvesting the flu vaccine currently takes at least six months and \nrequires tens of thousands of fertilized eggs susceptible to \ncontamination, this process must begin nearly a year before the flu \nseason begins.\n\n  Research should be focused on developing new technologies to allow us \nto produce more vaccine--in the same season--when we encounter a \nshortage. For example, a company in Connecticut is developing a flu \nvaccine relying on cell lines from silk moths. Reverse genetics \ntechnology also holds potential that researchers should explore. These \ntypes of innovative research promise to shave at least one month off of \nproduction time and significantly reduce cost.\n  Rather than temporarily masking problems through wasted spending on \nvaccine surpluses, my bill would ensure that the federal government \ninvests in lasting solutions to the challenges of flu vaccine \nproduction. The encouragement of safer and faster flu vaccine \nproduction technology is a prudent use of federal research dollars \nthrough the National Institutes of Health.\n  To invest in these new technologies, flu vaccine manufacturers will \nhave to renovate existing facilities or construct new ones. My bill \ngives a tax\n\n[[Page S262]]\n\ncredit to companies, new and old, to assist them in this important \nventure.\n  Currently, ten American companies produce the forty-seven FDA-\napproved vaccines. An investment tax credit will encourage these \nexisting companies to expand their production to cover the flu vaccine \nand will invite start-up companies to join the industry. This will \nbetter equip the United States market to prevent and deal with a \nshortage in the future.\n  Furthermore, my bill removes the suffocating price controls that have \ndiscouraged companies from producing the flu vaccine. The Vaccines For \nChildren program (VFC), enacted under the Clinton Administration, \nimposed a price cap on all vaccines purchased through federal \ncontracts. From a shortsighted perspective, these regulated prices may \nexpand access to vaccines. However, in the long run this policy \ndevastates the vaccine production industry and decreases the \navailability of vaccines. This occurred in 1998 when manufacturers of \nTetanus Diphtheria vaccine refused to bid on government contracts. \nConsequently, this vaccine is no longer available to children through \nthe VFC program.\n  Similarly, the CDC purchased nearly 12 percent of the flu vaccine \nthis season, and significant quantities were purchased through the \nDepartment of Defense, the Veteran's Administration, and Medicare. The \nprice controls imposed from federal government purchasing create a \nhigh-risk, low-reward business market. Price controls destroy any \nprofit incentive. Manufacturers avoid this artificial environment and \nwill continue to as long as the government over steps its bounds.\n  The harmful effect of government price controls is especially \npronounced in the flu vaccine market because the vaccine has a single-\nseason shelf life. The difficulty of predicting the demand for vaccines \neach year exposes companies great risk. A slight drop in demand can \nforce them out of the market. Financial losses--from seven million \nextra doses in 2002 and 4.5 million extra in 2003--compelled Wyeth \nPharmaceutical Company to end its flu vaccine manufacturing.\n  Scientific experts consider vaccination to be the most effective \nmedical intervention, and we live in an age of unprecedented vaccine \ndevelopment and implementation. We cannot continue to over-regulate the \nflu vaccine industry and hope companies will hang on and produce \nvaccines regardless of profit. The current national flu vaccine \nshortage reveals the need to act.\n  My bill would steer NIH research dollars towards cutting-edge \ntechnology, remove suffocating price controls, and free American \ncompanies to enter the flu vaccine industry with an investment tax \ncredit. I urge my colleagues to stand with me in supporting this vital \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. TALENT:\n  S. 102.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) \n     Program established by the Personal Responsibility and Work \n     Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-193) \n     has succeeded in moving families from welfare to work and \n     reducing child poverty.\n       (A) There has been a dramatic increase in the employment of \n     current and former welfare recipients. The percentage of \n     working recipients reached an all-time high in fiscal year \n     1999 and continued steady in fiscal years 2000 and 2001. In \n     fiscal year 2003, 31.3 percent of adult recipients were \n     counted as meeting the work participation requirements. All \n     States but one met the overall participation rate standard in \n     fiscal year 2003, as did the District of Columbia and Puerto \n     Rico.\n       (B) Earnings for welfare recipients remaining on the rolls \n     have also increased significantly, as have earnings for \n     female-headed households. The increases have been \n     particularly large for the bottom 2 income quintiles, that \n     is, those women who are most likely to be former or present \n     welfare recipients.\n       (C) Welfare dependency has plummeted. As of June 2004, \n     1,969,909 families and 4,727,291 individuals were receiving \n     assistance. Accordingly, the number of families in the \n     welfare caseload and the number of individuals receiving cash \n     assistance declined 55 percent and 61 percent, respectively, \n     since the enactment of TANF.\n       (D) The child poverty rate continued to decline between \n     1996 and 2003, falling 14 percent from 20.5 to 17.6 percent. \n     Child poverty rates for African-American and Hispanic \n     children have also fallen dramatically during the past 7 \n     years.\n\n[[Page S265]]\n\n       (2) As a Nation, we have made substantial progress in \n     reducing teen pregnancies and births, slowing increases in \n     nonmarital childbearing, and improving child support \n     collections and paternity establishment.\n       (A) The birth rate to teenagers declined 30 percent from \n     its high in 1991 to 2002. The 2002 teenage birth rate of 43.0 \n     per 1,000 women aged 15-19 is the lowest recorded birth rate \n     for teenagers.\n       (B) During the period from 1991 through 2001, teenage birth \n     rates fell in all States and the District of Columbia, Puerto \n     Rico, Guam, and the Virgin Islands. Declines also have \n     spanned age, racial, and ethnic groups. There has been \n     success in lowering the birth rate for both younger and older \n     teens. The birth rate for those 15-17 years of age has \n     declined 40 percent since 1991, and the rate for those 18 and \n     19 has declined 23 percent. The rate for African American \n     teens--until recently the highest--has declined the most--42 \n     percent from 1991 through 2002.\n       (C) Since the enactment of the Personal Responsibility and \n     Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, child support \n     collections within the child support enforcement system have \n     grown every year, increasing from $12,000,000,000 in fiscal \n     year 1996 to over $21,000,000,000 in fiscal year 2003. The \n     number of paternities established or acknowledged in fiscal \n     year 2003 (over 1,500,000) includes a more than 100 percent \n     increase through in-hospital acknowledgement programs--\n     862,043 in 2003 compared to 324,652 in 1996. Child support \n     collections were made in nearly 8,000,000 cases in fiscal \n     year 2003, significantly more than the almost 4,000,000 cases \n     having a collection in 1996.\n       (3) The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity \n     Reconciliation Act of 1996 gave States great flexibility in \n     the use of Federal funds to develop innovative programs to \n     help families leave welfare and begin employment and to \n     encourage the formation of 2-parent families.\n       (A) Total Federal and State TANF expenditures in fiscal \n     year 2003 were $26,300,000,000, up from $25,400,000,000 in \n     fiscal year 2002 and $22,600,000,000 in fiscal year 1999. \n     This increased spending is attributable to significant new \n     investments in supportive services in the TANF program, such \n     as child care and activities to support work.\n       (B) Since the welfare reform effort began there has been a \n     dramatic increase in work participation (including \n     employment, community service, and work experience) among \n     welfare recipients, as well as an unprecedented reduction in \n     the caseload because recipients have left welfare for work.\n       (C) States are making policy choices and investment \n     decisions best suited to the needs of their citizens.\n       (i) To expand aid to working families, almost all States \n     disregard a portion of a family's earned income when \n     determining benefit levels.\n       (ii) Most States increased the limits on countable assets \n     above the former Aid to Families with Dependent Children \n     (AFDC) program. Every State has increased the vehicle asset \n     level above the prior AFDC limit for a family's primary \n     automobile.\n       (iii) States are experimenting with programs to promote \n     marriage and paternal involvement. Over half of the States \n     have eliminated restrictions on 2-parent families. Many \n     States use TANF, child support, or State funds to support \n     community-based activities to help fathers become more \n     involved in their children's lives or strengthen \n     relationships between mothers and fathers.\n       (4) However, despite this success, there is still progress \n     to be made. Policies that support and promote more work, \n     strengthen families, and enhance State flexibility are \n     necessary to continue to build on the success of welfare \n     reform.\n       (A) Significant numbers of welfare recipients still are not \n     engaged in employment-related activities. While all States \n     have met the overall work participation rates required by \n     law, in an average month, only 41 percent of all families \n     with an adult participated in work activities that were \n     countable toward the State's participation rate. In fiscal \n     year 2003, four jurisdictions failed to meet the more \n     rigorous 2-parent work requirements, and 25 jurisdictions \n     (States and territories) are not subject to the 2-parent \n     requirements, most because they moved their 2-parent cases to \n     separate State programs where they are not subject to a \n     penalty for failing the 2-parent rates.\n       (B) In 2002, 34 percent of all births in the U.S. were to \n     unmarried women. And, with fewer teens entering marriage, the \n     proportion of births to unmarried teens has increased \n     dramatically (80 percent in 2002 versus 30 percent in 1970). \n     The negative consequences of out-of-wedlock birth on the \n     mother, the child, the family, and society are well \n     documented. These include increased likelihood of welfare \n     dependency, increased risks of low birth weight, poor \n     cognitive development, child abuse and neglect, and teen \n     parenthood, and decreased likelihood of having an intact \n     marriage during adulthood.\n       (C) There has been a dramatic rise in cohabitation as \n     marriages have declined. It is estimated that 40 percent of \n     children are expected to live in a cohabiting-parent family \n     at some point during their childhood. Children in single-\n     parent households and cohabiting-parent households are at \n     much higher risk of child abuse than children in intact \n     married families.\n       (D) Children who live apart from their biological fathers, \n     on average, are more likely to be poor, experience \n     educational, health, emotional, and psychological problems, \n     be victims of child abuse, engage in criminal behavior, and \n     become involved with the juvenile justice system than their \n     peers who live with their married, biological mother and \n     father. A child living with a single mother is nearly 5 times \n     as likely to be poor as a child living in a married-couple \n     family. In 2003, in married-couple families, the child \n     poverty rate was 8.6 percent, and in households headed by a \n     single mother the poverty rate was 41.7 percent.\n       (5) Therefore, it is the sense of the Congress that \n     increasing success in moving families from welfare to work, \n     as well as in promoting healthy marriage and other means of \n     improving child well-being, are very important Government \n     interests and the policy contained in part A of title IV of \n     the Social Security Act (as amended by this Act) is intended \n     to serve those ends.\n\n                             TITLE I--TANF\n\n     SEC. 101.

A bill to prohibit the operation during a calendar year of \nthe final rule issued by the Secretary of Agriculture to establish \nstandards for the designation of minimal-risk regions for the \nintroduction of bovine spongiform encephalopathy into the United \nStates, including designation of Canada as a minimal-risk region, and \nthe importation into the United States from Canada of certain bovine \nruminant products during that calendar year, unless country of origin \nlabeling is required for the retail sale of a covered commodity during \nthat calendar year; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am an original cosponsor of legislation \nwhich was introduced today by Senators Johnson and Enzi. This \nlegislation requires that a mandatory system of country of-origin \nlabeling be in place before the U.S. Department of Agriculture can open \nthe border to imports of live Canadian cattle.\n  This legislation would not be necessary if USDA and this \nAdministration were not furiously pushing to allow live Canadian cattle \ninto this country. I am very concerned that they are doing this despite \nthe most recent discovery, just a few weeks ago, of two more Canadian \ncows infected with BSE.\n  I believe that the decision to open the border to live Canadian \ncattle should be made based on sound science, not politics. The border \nshould be opened when science indicates that it is safe to do so, and \nnot before.\n  I also believe that it is necessary that this country have a system \nof country-of-origin labeling in place before the border is opened. \nThat is the only way American consumers will be able to choose between \nbeef raised in America and beef raised in Canada. Right now there is no \nway to tell the difference. We must have country-of-origin labeling in \nplace before we allow Canadian cattle into this country, and that is \nwhy I am cosponsoring this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. VITTER (for himself, Mr. Salazar, Mr. Thune, and Mr. \n        DeMint):\n  S. 109. A bill entitled ``Pharmaceutical Market Access Act of 2005''; \nto the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 109\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Pharmaceutical Market Access \n     Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) Americans unjustly pay up to 1000 percent more to fill \n     their prescriptions than consumers in other countries.\n       (2) The United States is the world's largest market for \n     pharmaceuticals yet consumers still pay the world's highest \n     prices.\n       (3) An unaffordable drug is neither safe nor effective. \n     Allowing and structuring the importation of prescription \n     drugs ensures access to affordable drugs, thus providing a\n\n[[Page S279]]\n\n     level of safety to American consumers they do not currently \n     enjoy.\n       (4) According to the Congressional Budget Office, American \n     seniors alone will spend $1,800,000,000,000 on \n     pharmaceuticals over the next 10 years.\n       (5) Allowing open pharmaceutical markets could save \n     American consumers at least $635,000,000,000 of their own \n     money each year.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n       (1) To give all Americans immediate relief from the \n     outrageously high cost of pharmaceuticals.\n       (2) To reverse the perverse economics of the American \n     pharmaceutical market.\n       (3) To allow the importation of prescription drugs only if \n     the drugs and facilities where such drugs are manufactured \n     are approved by the Food and Drug Administration, and to \n     exclude pharmaceutical narcotics.\n       (4) To require that imported prescription drugs be packaged \n     and shipped using counterfeit-resistant technologies.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill for the relief of Robert Liang and Alice Liang; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I offer today private relief \nlegislation to provide lawful permanent residence status to Robert Kuan \nLiang and his wife, Chun-Mei (``Alice'') Hsu-Liang, foreign nationals \nwho live in San Bruno, California.\n  I have decided to offer private relief immigration bills on their \nbehalf because I believe that, without it, this hardworking couple and \ntheir three United States citizen children would endure an immense and \nunfair hardship. Indeed, without this legislation, this family may not \nremain a family for much longer.\n  The Liangs are foreign nationals facing deportation on account of \ntheir overstay of visitors visas and the failure of their previous \nattorney to timely file a suspension of deportation application before \nthe immigration laws changed in 1996.\n  Mr. Liang is a foreign national and refugee from Laos. His wife is a \ncitizen of Taiwan. They entered the United States 22 years ago as \ntourists and established residency in the San Bruno, CA. Because they \noverstayed the terms of their temporary visas, they now face \ndeportation from the United States.\n  After living here for so many years, removal from the United States \nwould not come easily or perhaps without tearing this family apart. The \nLiangs have three children born in this country: Wesley, 13 years old, \nBruce, 10 years old, and Eva, 7 years old. Young Wesley suffers from \nasthma and has a history of social and emotional anxiety. The \nimmigration judge who presided over the Liang's case in 1997 concluded \nthat there was no question that the Liang children would be adversely \nimpacted if they were required to leave their relatives and friends \nbehind in California to follow their parents to Taiwan, a country whose \nlanguage and culture is unfamiliar to them. And that was 7 years ago. I \ncan only imagine how much more they would be adversely impacted now \ngiven the passage of 7 more years.\n  The Liangs have filed annual income tax returns; established a \nsuccessful business, Fong Yong Restaurant, in the United States; are \nhome owners, and are financially successful. Since they arrived in the \nUnited States, they have pursued and, to a degree, achieved the \nAmerican Dream.\n  Mr. and Mrs. Liang's quest to legalize their immigration status began \nin 1993 when they filed for relief from deportation before an \nimmigration judge. The Immigration and Naturalization Service, however, \ndid not act on their application until nearly 5 years later, in 1997, \nafter which time the immigration laws had significantly changed.\n  According to the immigration judge, had the INS acted on their \napplication for relief from deportation in a timely manner, they would \nhave qualified for suspension of deportation, given that they were \nlong-term residents of this country with US citizen children and other \npositive factors. By the time INS processed their application, however, \nCongress passed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant \nResponsibility Act of 1996, which changed the requirements for relief \nfrom removal to the Liangs' disadvantage.\n  I supported the changes of the 1996 law, but I believe sometimes \nthere are exceptions which merit special consideration. The Liangs are \nsuch a couple and family. Perhaps what distinguishes this family from \nmany others is that through hard work and perseverance, Mr. Liang has \nachieved a significant degree of success in the United States while \nbattling a severe form of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. According to \nhis psychologist, this disorder stems from the persecution he, his \nfamily and community experienced in his native\n\n[[Page S283]]\n\ncountry of Laos during the Vietnam War. Throughout his childhood and \nadolescence, Mr. Liang was exposed to numerous traumatic experiences, \nincluding the murder of his mother by the North Vietnamese and frequent \nepisodes of wartime violence. He also routinely witnessed the brutal \npersecution and deaths of others in his village. In 1975, he was \ngranted refugee status in Taiwan.\n  The emotional impact of Mr. Liang's experiences in his war-torn \nnative country have been profound and continue to haunt him. In \naddition to being diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, his \npsychologist has also indicated that he suffers from severe clinical \ndepression, which has been exacerbated by the prospect of being \ndeported to Taiwan, where on account of his nationality, he believes he \nand his family would be treated as second-class citizens. Moreover, Mr. \nLiang believes that the pursuit of further mental health treatment in \nTaiwan would only exacerbate the stigma of being an outsider in a \ncountry whose language he does not speak. Given those prospects, he \nalso fears the impact such a stigma would have on the well-being and \nfuture of his children.\n  Given these extraordinary and unique facts, I ask my colleagues to \nsupport this private relief bill on behalf of the Liangs.\n  I also ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be \nprinted in the Record and that the attached three letters of community \nsupport also be printed.\n  There being no objection, the bill and letters were ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 110\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: Robert and Alice Liang and their \n     Fon Yong Restaurant at 1065 Holly Street are members in good \n     standing of the San Carlos Chamber of Commerce. As such they \n     have shown their commitment to be members in good standing of \n     the San Carlos business community. Chamber members tend to \n     reflect a desire for community involvement and support for \n     their city. The Liangs took the initiative to start a \n     business here and have maintained it beautifully. They have a \n     very loyal cadre of customers.\n       The Chamber is always happy to see good small businesses \n     like Fon Yong thrive. The Chamber stands behind Alice and her \n     family in their quest for permanent residence in the United \n     States. Alice is well known to all who frequent her \n     restaurant as a warm, friendly business woman who even takes \n     the time to remember what her regulars' favorites are.\n       The Liang family is a stable one and they contribute to the \n     community here. They have done good rather than harm as they \n     settled here. I hope you can respond positively to their \n     example and settle the immigration issue quickly.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              Sheryl Pomerenk,\n\n     CEO, San Carlos Chamber of Commerce.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 January 13, 2005.\n     Hon.

Recently, Alice \n     heard about Chloe Chang, a young local girl who had acute \n     promyelocytic leukemia. Chloe had undergone chemotherapy, but \n     had a relapse. She needed a bone marrow transplant, and was \n     looking for a donor. Her family was facing mounting bills \n     from the donor search. Alice asked me if there was any way \n     she could help. I should point out that she had never met \n     this family, she just knew they were in need from newspaper \n     articles and TV broadcasts. We put together a fund-raising \n     dinner event at Stanford University in which I bought the \n     ingredients, and Robert and Alice worked all day cooking a \n     hundred dinners. Together, we raised almost a thousand \n     dollars to help Chloe's family.\n       This is not the only time that Robert and Alice have gone \n     out of their way to help others, even while they themselves \n     face deportation. It amazes me that they can think of others \n     at such a time, but that's the kind of people they are. I am \n     so worried about Robert, especially, because he is still \n     suffering from all the things he saw as a child and a \n     teenager in Laos. People were dragged out and killed in front \n     of him, and his own mother was killed by the Communists \n     before the rest of the family escaped. After two decades \n     here, Robert has found a little peace, and I can't even think \n     what it will do to him to have that taken away. I want you as \n     my senator to do whatever it takes to make sure that these \n     two wonderful people can stay here where they belong. Please \n     sponsor a private bill and try to convince other members of \n     Congress to support it. If there's anything I can do to help, \n     please let me know.\n           Sincerely,\n     Sue Chow.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 January 12, 2005.\n     Senator Dianne Feinstein,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: I am writing you as a friend and \n     customer of Robert and Alice Liang of San Bruno, because I \n     understand that you may be considering resubmitting a private \n     bill in their favor. I certainly hope that you do resubmit \n     and support this private bill. These are extraordinary people \n     in the way they and their business have enhanced our \n     community of San Carlos. Alice and Robert have really created \n     a special community of customers and friends with their \n     restaurant.\n       It's hard to describe how much of an asset the Liangs are \n     to our community. They are good neighbors. They are welcoming \n     friends and hosts. They expect only good from people and they \n     reach out with friendship and aid to those around them.\n       Robert and Alice have touched the hundreds of customers who \n     have walked in the doors of Fon Yong Restaurant by not only \n     preparing very good food, but by reaching us personally with \n     very caring, unsolicited acts of kindness and neighborliness. \n     A couple of examples include their bringing my husband's \n     favorite vegetarian meal to him at Sequoia Hospital, when he \n     was undergoing rehabilitation from a stroke, and regularly \n     assisting the disabled daughter of a customer as she works to \n     feed herself dinner in the restaurant. Their actions of \n     kindness remind all of us what it is to be a good neighbor. \n     These are the values and qualities we hope for in our \n     neighbors.\n       The private bill you submitted in the last Congress did \n     help reduce Robert's anxiety level. (As you know, he is being \n     treated for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.) I am very \n     concerned though, about what may happen to the family if they \n     are forced to leave the United States and relocate to a place \n     the children have never seen, is a half a life away for \n     Alice, and is certainly not Robert's home. I hope you will \n     resubmit your bill for the Liangs and encourage your fellow \n     members of the Senate to support the Liangs in their quest to \n     join us as citizens of the United States.\n       Thank you so much for your support of the Liangs. Also, \n     please know that I am ready and willing to help you help \n     them.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Barbara Maas.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 111. A bill for the relief of Shigeru Yamada; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I offer today private relief \nlegislation to provide lawful permanent residence status to Shigeru \nYamada, a 22-year-old Japanese national who lives in Chula Vista, CA.\n  I have decided to introduce a private bill on his behalf because I \nbelieve that Mr. Yamada represents a model American citizen, for whom \nremoval from this country would represent an unfair hardship. Without \nthis legislation, Mr. Yamada will be forced to return to a country in \nwhich he lacks any linguistic, cultural or family ties.\n  Mr. Yamada legally entered the United States with his mother and two \nsisters in 1992 at the young age of 10. The family was fleeing from Mr. \nYamada's alcoholic father, who had been physically abusive to his \nmother, the children and even his own parents. Since then, he has had \nno contact with his father and is unsure if he is even alive. \nTragically, Mr. Yamada experienced further hardship when his mother was \nkilled in a car crash in 1995. Orphaned at the age of 13, Mr. Yamada\n\n[[Page S284]]\n\nspent time living with his aunt before moving to Chula Vista to live \nwith a close friend of his late mother.\n  The death of his mother marked more than a personal tragedy for Mr. \nYamada; it also served to impede the process for him to legalize his \nstatus. At the time of her death, Mr. Yamada's family was living \nlegally in the United States. His mother had acquired a student visa \nfor herself and her children qualified as her dependents. Her death \nrevoked his legal status in the United States. In addition, Mr. \nYamada's mother was engaged to an American citizen at the time of her \ndeath. Had she survived, her son would likely have become an American \ncitizen through this marriage.\n  Mr. Yamada has exhausted all administrative options under our current \nimmigration system. Throughout high school, he contacted attorneys in \nthe hopes of legalizing his status, but his attempts were unsuccessful. \nUnfortunately, time has run out and, for Mr. Yamada, the only option \navailable to him today is private relief legislation.\n  For several reasons, it would be tragic for Mr. Yamada to be deported \nfrom the United States and forced to return to Japan.\n  First, since arriving in the United States, Mr. Yamada has lived as a \nmodel American. He graduated with honors from Eastlake High School in \n2000, where he excelled in both academics and athletics. Academically, \nhe earned a number of awards including being named an ``Outstanding \nEnglish Student'' his freshman year, an All-American Scholar, and \nearning the United States National Minority Leadership Award. His \nteacher and coach, Mr. John Inumerable, describes him as being \n``responsible, hard working, organized, honest, caring and very \ndependable.'' His role as the Vice-President of the Associated Student \nBody his senior year is an indication of Mr. Yamada's high level of \nleadership, as well as, his popularity and trustworthiness among his \npeers. As an athlete, Mr. Yamada was named the ``Most Inspirational \nPlayer of the Year'' in Junior Varsity baseball and football, as well \nas, Varsity football. His football coach, Mr. Jose Mendoza, expressed \nhis admiration by saying that he has ``seen in Shigeru Yamada the \nresponsibility, dedication and loyalty that the average American holds \nto be virtuous.''\n\n  Second, Mr. Yamada has distinguished himself as a local volunteer. As \na member of the Eastlake High School Link Crew, he helped freshman find \ntheir way around campus, offered tutoring and mentoring services, and \nset an example of how to be a successful member of the student body. \nAfter graduating from high school, he volunteered his time for 4 years \nas the coach of the Eastlake High School Girl's softball team. The \nformer head coach, who has since retired, Dr. Charles Sorge, describes \nhim as an individual full of ``integrity'' who understands that as a \ncoach it is important to work as a ``team player.'' His level of \ncommitment to the team was further illustrated to Dr. Sorge when he \ndiscovered, halfway through the season, that Mr. Yamada's commute to \nand from practice was 2 hours long each way. It takes an individual \nwith character to volunteer his time to coach and never bring up the \nissue of how long his commute takes him each day. Dr. Sorge hopes that, \nonce Mr. Yamada legalizes his immigration status, he will be formally \nhired to continue coaching the team.\n  Third, sending Mr. Yamada back to Japan would be an immense hardship \nfor him and his family here. Mr. Yamada does not speak Japanese. He is \nunaware of the nation's current cultural trends. And, he has no \nimmediate family members that he knows of in Japan. Currently, both of \nhis sisters are in the process of legalizing their immigration status \nin the United States. His older sister is married to a United States \ncitizen and his younger sister is being adopted by a maternal aunt, who \nis a United States citizen. Since as all of his family lives in \nCalifornia, sending Mr. Yamada back to Japan would serve to split his \nfamily apart and separate him from everyone and everything that he \nknows. His sister contends that her younger brother would be ``lost'' \nif he had to return to live in Japan on his own. It is unlikely that he \nwould be able to find any gainful employment in Japan due to his \ninability to speak or read the language.\n  As a member of the Chula Vista community, Mr. Yamada has \ndistinguished himself as an honorable individual. His teacher, Mr. \nRobert Hughes, describes him as being an ``upstanding `All-American' \nyoung man''. Until being picked up during a routine check of riders' \nimmigration status on a city bus, he had never been arrested or \nconvicted of any crime. Mr. Yamada is not, and has never been, a burden \non the State. He has never received any Federal or State assistance.\n  Currently, Mr. Yamada holds sophomore status at Southwestern \nCommunity College. However, he is taking this semester off in order to \nalleviate his financial burdens by working full time. He had hoped to \npursue a career in law enforcement, but his plans have recently changed \ndue to his current immigration status dilemma. Until he obtains \ncitizenship, Mr. Yamada will be prohibited from pursuing a career in \nlaw enforcement. Due to the circumstances, Mr. Yamada has changed his \ncareer goal to that of becoming a high school teacher. Mr. Yamada's \ncommitment to his education is admirable. He could have easily taken a \ndifferent path but, through his own ``individual fortitude,'' he has \ndedicated himself to his studies so that he can live a better life.\n  With his hard work and giving attitude, Shigeru Yamada represents the \nideal American citizen. Although born in Japan, he is truly American in \nevery other sense. I ask you to help right a wrong and grant Mr. Yamada \nlawful permanent resident status so that he can continue towards his \nbright future.\n  Given these extraordinary and unique facts, I ask my colleagues to \nsupport this private relief bill on behalf of Mr. Yamada.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord and that the three letters of community support be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 111\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PERMANENT RESIDENT STATUS FOR SHIGERU YAMADA.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b) of \n     section 201 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. \n     1151), Shigeru Yamada shall be eligible for issuance of an \n     immigrant visa or for adjustment of status to that of an \n     alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence upon filing \n     an application for issuance of an immigrant visa under \n     section 204 of that Act or for adjustment of status to lawful \n     permanent resident.\n       (b) Adjustment of Status.--If Shigeru Yamada enters the \n     United States before the filing deadline specified in \n     subsection (c), Shigeru Yamada shall be considered to have \n     entered and remained lawfully and shall be eligible for \n     adjustment of status under section 245 of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1255) as of the date of enactment \n     of this Act.\n       (c) Deadline for Application and Payment of Fees.--\n     Subsections (a) and (b) shall apply only if the application \n     for issuance of an immigrant visa or the application for \n     adjustment of status is filed with appropriate fees within 2 \n     years after the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (d) Reduction of Immigrant Visa Numbers.--Upon the granting \n     of an immigrant visa or permanent residence to Shigeru \n     Yamada, the Secretary of State shall instruct the proper \n     officer to reduce by 1, during the current or next following \n     fiscal year, the total number of immigrant visas that are \n     made available to natives of the country of birth of Shigeru \n     Yamada under section 203(a) of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act or, if applicable, the total number of \n     immigrant visas that are made available to natives of the \n     country of birth of Shigeru Yamada under section 202(e) of \n     that Act.\n\n                                         Eastlake High School,\n\n                                Chula Vista, CA, January 17, 2005.\n     Senator Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: I am more than happy to write this \n     letter on behalf of Shigeru Yamada as he pursues his efforts \n     to stay in the United States. I was Shigeru's counselor while \n     he attended Eastlake High School. During that time he always \n     displayed exemplary behavior, academic focus, and personal \n     determination.\n       Academically Shigeru was a model student. He earned a 3.84 \n     grade point average; he made the National Honor Roll and was \n     nominated to Who's Who Among High School Students for three \n     straight years. Shigeru plans to attend a university to study \n     sports medicine and physical therapy so he has set high goals \n     for himself. He has the ability to not only handle college-\n     level work, but to thrive on the challenge the university \n     will\n\n[[Page S285]]\n\n     bring. His quiet determination has been an example to his \n     peers and was a joy to his instructors.\n       Shigeru Yamada not only took the most from his high school \n     experience, but he has consistently ``given back'' his \n     talents, time, and effort to serve the school community. He \n     was elected ASB vice-president during his senior year. He \n     demonstrated leadership skills as president of the Inter-Club \n     Council on campus; he mentored incoming ninth-grade students \n     and worked on numerous service projects. In addition to his \n     involvement in student government, Shigeru participated in \n     football, baseball, and wrestling. He was named ``Most \n     Inspirational Player of the Year'' for both his junior \n     varsity baseball and football teams. He was also awarded the \n     J.T. Franks Memorial Award (most inspirational) from the \n     varsity football team. (This award carries a great deal of \n     respect amongst the players as it is named after a teammate \n     who died of cancer.) Shigeru was a role model for our \n     students when he attended our school: He earned good grades; \n     he was an athlete; and he was involved in a variety of \n     additional activities. He is the kind of student that \n     Eastlake High School has been proud to have.\n       A further testimony to Shigeru's character is what he has \n     been doing since graduating. This young man has come back to \n     serve as an assistant football and wrestling coach for our \n     students. He gives his time and energy to working with \n     individual students during the week and on weekends; he not \n     only advises them on how to improve their athletic skills, \n     but he is also a wonderful role model and mentor. He is \n     someone to whom the young men can relate, a person whose \n     opinions are valued. I have personally seen Shigeru interact \n     with these boys; the respect he gives them and the respect \n     they give Shigeru is an absolute indication of the positive \n     influence he has in their lives.\n       Shigeru is seeking permanent resident status in the United \n     States through a private bill that you have agreed to \n     sponsor. Were his mother still alive, his residency would not \n     be in question. However, since she died a few years ago in a \n     car accident, Shigeru has had to get through high school \n     without her guidance and support, and now his future in the \n     United States is in jeopardy. Shigeru Yamada has already \n     proven himself to be a hard-working, law-abiding, goal-\n     oriented young man. He has already proven himself to be a \n     productive member of society. And, most importantly, Shigeru \n     wants to not only take the best this society has to offer, \n     but to also give back to the society to make it a better \n     place for those around him.\n       Perhaps the best endorsement that I can give is that I \n     would be proud to claim Shigeru Yamada as my son. He embodies \n     all the qualities that I have tried to instill in my own \n     sons. Please, I urge you to submit the bill that would give \n     Shigeru Yamada permanent residency in the United States. He \n     will represent all of us well.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Ann M. Stevens,\n     Asst. Principal.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                         Eastlake High School,\n\n                                Chula Vista, CA, January 13, 2005.\n       Hon. Dianne Feinstein: I am writing to bring to your \n     attention the need to support a fine young man, Shigeru \n     Yamada. I am a teacher and coach at Eastlake High School; I \n     have known Shigeru for 8 years, both as a student and as a \n     volunteer coach during the last 5 years. What has singularly \n     impressed me about this young man is that he has created \n     himself and never complained about his life's struggles. His \n     mother died when he was young. He got little support from his \n     aunt--materially, emotionally, spiritually. Yet all the while \n     you would not have known that. He set goals for himself \n     academically and athletically; modeled himself on good ideals \n     of community service and service to his school. He was vice-\n     president of the Associated Student Body at Eastlake High and \n     would have pursued an academic future at UCLA were it not for \n     his citizenship status. Instead, he did what he could do and \n     has gone to community college in an effort to pursue his \n     college degree.\n       All the while, he volunteered his time during these past 5 \n     years to help coach our school's softball team (as well as \n     other sports on campus). It was only recently that I had \n     discovered that it would take him 2 hours with bus transfers \n     just to get to softball practice.\n       I provide this information to you as a testimonial to the \n     character of this young man. Exceptional in attitude and \n     determination. We need this kind of spirit and resolve in \n     America. We do not want to export it somewhere else. Please \n     help.\n           Respectfully,\n\n                                             Charles R. Sorge,\n\n                                        Ed.D., English Teacher and\n     Head Softball Coach.\n                                  ____\n\n                                             Eastlake High School,\n\n\n                                      Associated Student Body,\n\n                                Chula Vista, CA, January 14, 2005.\n       Congressman Filner: Please consider the reintroduction of \n     the private bill for permanent residency on behalf of Shigeru \n     Yamada. He is a most outstanding person, with character \n     second to none. Shigeru Yamada has no ties, nor any cultural \n     background with Japan. Since he has been raised in the United \n     States for the past 12 years out of his 22 years, he is not \n     able to communicate in the Japanese language. Therefore, to \n     throw Shiguru back into a world of confusion will not only be \n     a tragic event for him, but a loss for the United States and \n     the Chula Vista community.\n       Once again we cannot lose a strong member of this society. \n     Please consider his request for sponsorship.\n       Sincerely,\n                                                      Bob Barrett,\n                                              Assistant Principal.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 112. A bill for the relief of Denes Fulop and Gyorgyi Fulop; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I offer today a private immigration \nrelief bill to provide lawful permanent residence status to Denes and \nGyorgyi Fulop, Hungarian nationals who have lived in California for \nmore than 20 years. The Fulops are the parents of six U.S. citizen \nchildren. Today, they face deportation having exhausted all \nadministrative remedies under our immigration system.\n  The Fulop's story is a compelling one and one which I believe merits \nCongress' consideration for humanitarian relief.\n  The most poignant tragedy to affect this family occurred in May 2000, \nwhen the Fulops eldest child, Robert ``Bobby'' Fulop, an accomplished \n15 year-old teenager, died suddenly of a heart aneurism. Bobby was \nconsidered the shining star of his family.\n  That same year their six-year-old daughter, Elizabeth, was diagnosed \nwith moderate pulmonary stenosis, a potentially life-threatening heart \ncondition and a frightening situation similar to Bobby's. Not long ago, \nshe successfully underwent heart surgery, but requires medical \nsupervision to ensure her good health.\n  The Fulop's youngest child, Matthew, was born seven weeks premature. \nHe subsequently underwent several kidney surgeries and is still being \nclosely monitored by physicians.\n  Compounding these tragedies is the fact that today the Fulops face \ndeportation. They face deportation, in part, because in 1995 the family \ntraveled to Hungary and remained there for more than 90 days. Under the \npre-1996 immigration law, prior to the Illegal Immigration Reform and \nImmigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, their stay in Hungary would not \nhave been a factor in their immigration case and they would have been \neligible for adjustment of status to lawful permanent residents.\n  Indeed, in 1996, Mr. and Mrs. Fulop applied to the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service, INS, for permanent resident status. Due to \nlarge backlogs, the INS did not interview them until 1998. By the time \ntheir applications were considered, the new 1996 immigration law had \ntaken effect. Given their one-time 90 day trip outside the United \nStates, they were statutorily ineligible for relief pursuant to the \ncancellation of removal provisions of the Immigration and Nationality \nAct.\n  One cannot help but conclude that had the INS acted on the Fulop's \napplication for relief from deportation in a timelier manner, they \nwould have qualified for suspension of deportation under the pre-1996 \nlaw, given that they were long-term residents of the United States with \nU.S. Citizen children and many positive factors in their favor.\n  The irony of this situation is that the Fulops were gone from the \nUnited States for nearly five months in 1995 because they traveled to \nHungary to help Mr. Fulop's brother build his home. Mr. Fulop's brother \nis handicap and they went to help remodel his home.\n  The Fulops are good and decent people. Mr. Fulop is a masonry \ncontractor and the owner and president of his own construction \ncompany--Sumeg International. He has owned this business for 10 years \nand currently has three full-time employees.\n  The couple are active in their church and community. As Pastor Peter \nPetrovic of the Apostolic Christian Church of San Diego says in his \nletter of support, ``[t]he family is an exceptional asset to their \ncommunity.'' Mrs. Fulop has served as a Sunday school teacher and \nvolunteers regularly at Heritage K-8 Charter School in Escondido. Mrs. \nMorris, a Heritage K-8 Charter School faculty member says in her letter \nof support that Mrs. Fulop is \n``. . . a valuable asset to our school and community.''\n  Mr. President, this is a tragic situation. Essentially, as happened \nto many families under the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant \nResponsibility Act of 1996, the rules of the game were\n\n[[Page S286]]\n\nchanged in the middle. When the Fulops applied for relief from \ndeportation they were eligible for suspension of deportation. By the \ntime the INS got around to their application, nearly three years later, \nthey were no longer eligible and in fact suspension of deportation as a \nform of relief ceased to exist.\n  The Fulops today have been in the United States since the early \n1980s. Most harmful is the effect that their deportation will have on \nthe children, all of whom were born here and who range from one year \nold to 17 years of age. Their eldest, Dennis, is a 4.0 honor student at \nPalomar Community College having graduated from high school one year \nearly. His sister, Linda, has a 3.8 grade point average and is an honor \nstudent in high school.\n  It is my hope that Congress sees fit to provide an opportunity for \nthis family to remain together in the United States given their many \nyears here, the profound sadness they have already experienced and the \nharm that would come from their deportation to their six U.S. citizen \nchildren.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nthree letters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 112\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

They have been members in good \n     standing in our church for approximately 20 years. Denes has \n     served the congregation faithfully in many capacities. He was \n     a building committee member during the construction of our \n     church 10 years ago. He also served as church treasurer for \n     four years and Sunday School Superintendent for many years. \n     Presently he is a member on the board of trustees.\n       Joy Fulop was a building sub-committee member during the \n     construction of the church and also served for a few years as \n     a Sunday school teacher. Joy is a devoted and committed \n     homemaker, and a wonderful example of a loving mother and \n     wife. Their three younger children, Elizabeth, Sarah and \n     Abigail are actively involved in Sunday school and in various \n     youth group activities. The two oldest, Denny and Linda, are \n     also active in the church. They are very diligent and \n     excellent students in High School and outstanding citizens.\n       The family is an exceptional asset to their community. \n     Denes has been self-employed for many years and is a \n     knowledgeable and successful contractor. Their family has \n     never depended on any government aid, but rather contributes \n     and shares their blessings with others. Denes, Joy, and their \n     six children are truly an asset to our church and community.\n       Should you have any further questions, please don't \n     hesitate to contact me.\n           Respectfully submitted,\n                                                   Peter Petrovic,\n     Pastor.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                  Heritage K-8 Charter School,\n\n                                  Escondido, CA, January 14, 2005.\n       Dear Members of Congress, I am writing this letter on \n     behalf of the Fulop Family. I want to express my deep \n     appreciation for Mrs. Fulop's involvement at our elementary \n     school.\n       Abigail Fulop is a successful kindergarten student in my \n     class who performs above grade level. Sarah and Elizabeth \n     Fulop attend Heritage charter as well and are outstanding \n     students.\n       Mrs. Fulop volunteers on a regular basis in my kindergarten \n     classroom helping students become better readers. She takes a \n     reading group and works on reading strategies that increase \n     student' learning. She also takes time to volunteer in her \n     daughter Sarah's class. Her time and effort fosters a \n     learning environment. Recently she participated in a cooking \n     demonstration for the class. She also takes time out of her \n     busy schedule to help her daughter's third grade teacher plan \n     and prepare for field trips.\n       In all these things I have confidence that she is a \n     valuable asset to our school and community. Please consider \n     supporting their desire to remain with us. Please feel free \n     to contact me with any questions.\n           Sincerely,\n     Mrs. Morris.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                  R. Rimmer Construction Inc.,\n\n                                    Cardiff, CA, January 13, 2005.\n       To Whom It May Concern: The purpose of this letter is to \n     describe my relationship with Dennis Fulop, whom I have known \n     for approximately twenty-two years.\n       As a building contractor in the San Diego area I have been \n     fortunate to have worked with Dennis for most of those years. \n     He has constructed nearly all of the foundations for the room \n     additions and new houses that I have built. Dennis has also \n     constructed most of the driveways, sidewalks, retaining \n     walls, fireplaces and masonry on my projects. He has also \n     attended to much of my finish grading, drainage and backhoe \n     construction needs.\n       Dennis has long been an invaluable member of my \n     construction ``team''. He is very knowledgeable in nearly all \n     construction matters. He has always been very reliable and \n     responsible in meeting deadlines and upholding high standards \n     of construction quality.\n       Dennis is also a very successful small business owner. He \n     has his own credit accounts with all of the necessary \n     construction suppliers and to my knowledge has always paid \n     his bills in a timely manner. In fact, I have never been \n     contacted or liened by any of his suppliers to date. Dennis \n     is also very proficient at managing and providing work for \n     his employees.\n       Dennis's wife Joy is a dedicated wife and mother to their \n     six children.\n       I am very thankful to know the Fulop family personally and \n     I can attest that their values and deeply held convictions \n     make them valuable contributors to their local community and \n     society as a whole.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Ron Rimmer,\n                                                        President.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 113. A bill to modify the date as of which certain tribal land of \nthe Lytton Rancheria of California is deemed to be held in trust; to \nthe Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that would \nstrike a small provision in the Omnibus Indian Advancement Act of 2000; \nlanguage that circumvents the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act's common-\nsense protections and safeguards against the inappropriate siting of \nNevada-style casinos.\n  In December 2000, a one-paragraph provision was attached to the \nOmnibus Indian Advancement Act taking land into trust for a single \nIndian tribe--the Lytton--with the aim of allowing the tribe to bypass \nthe federal and state review process and expedite plans to establish a \nlarge, off-reservation gaming complex in an urban area near San \nFrancisco. Most astoundingly, this provision included a clause which \nmandated that the Secretary of Interior backdate the acquisition of \nthis land to October 17, 1988--despite the fact that the land was \nactually taken into trust in 2004. This backdating permitted the tribe \nto completely circumvent the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act's \nrequirements for gaming on newly acquired lands and avoid an important \nconsultative process prescribed in federal law.\n  Today California is home to 110 federally recognized tribes. Sixty-\nsix tribes have gaming compacts with the state and there are 57 tribal \ncasinos. With more than 50 tribes seeking federal recognition and \napproximately 25 recognized tribes seeking gaming compacts from the \nGovernor, revenues from California's tribal gaming industry are \nexpected to be the highest of any state's by the end of the decade. \nAccording to the latest statistics released by the National Indian \nGaming Commission, in 2003 California by itself accounted for about \nhalf of the increase in gaming revenues nationwide.\n  Mr. President, I have serious reservations about the expansion of \nNevada-style gaming--with its slot machines and in-house banking--into \nurban areas, and I am particularly concerned about off-reservation \ngambling and ``reservation shopping''. Off-reservation casinos often \ncause counties additional costs in public and local services, intrude \non residential areas, and are responsible for an increase of traffic \nand crime within local communities.\n\n[[Page S287]]\n\n  That is why Section 20 of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act requires \nthat tribes complete a ``two-part determination'' process prior to \nengaging in Class III gaming on newly acquired, or off-reservation \nlands. Under this law, tribes seeking to game on lands acquired after \nOctober 17, 1988, must receive the approval of both the state Governor \nand the Secretary of the Interior. In addition, this process requires \nthat the Secretary of the Interior consult with local communities and \nnearby tribes before making a final decision in these cases.\n  In August 2004, the Lytton tribe and the Governor of my state reached \nan agreement on a compact that would have permitted the development of \na 6-8 story casino housing 5,000 slot machines. Notably, this would be \nthe largest inventory of slot machines found in any casino outside of \nConnecticut. After the State Legislature balked at approving this \nmassive deal, the Governor and the tribe agreed to put forward a \nrevised compact that would allow for a 2,500 slot casino, while \npermitting the tribe to negotiate for additional slots in 2008. This \nlatest proposal remains unratified by the State Legislature.\n  Mr. President, without this legislation, the Lytton tribe will be \nable to open a massive gambling complex in a metropolitan area outside \nthe regulations set up by the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. Allowing \nthis to happen would set a dangerous precedent not only for California, \nbut every state where tribal gaming is permitted.\n  The changes I seek today are extremely limited. This legislation \nwould not reverse restoration of the tribe. It would not infringe on \nNative American sovereignty. It does not affect the land acquisition or \neven block the casino proposal. It only seeks to give the State and the \nlocal communities a voice in the process and ensure that gaming \ncontinues to be organized within the framework of the Indian Gaming \nRegulatory Act.\n  The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act has provided this Nation with a fair \nand balanced approach to Indian gaming by facilitating tribal plans for \neconomic recovery without compromising a multitude of factors that \nshould be taken into account when deciding on the siting of casinos. \nThis law works. It is a fair process that should continue to be \nfollowed.\n  It is simply not asking too much to require that Lytton be subject to \nthe regulatory and approval processes applicable to newly acquired \ntribal lands by the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this legislation and I look forward \nto working with the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Indian Affairs \nCommittee to pass this legislation quickly.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 113\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. LYTTON RANCHERIA OF CALIFORNIA.\n\n       Section 819 of the Omnibus Indian Advancement Act (114 \n     Stat. 2919) is amended by striking the last sentence.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mrs. Murray, Mr. \n        Lautenberg, Mr. Corzine, and Ms. Cantwell):\n  S. 114. A bill to amend titles XIX and XXI of the Social Security Act \nto ensure that every uninsured child in America has health insurance \ncoverage, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I'm honored to join my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Kerry, in introducing this legislation to guarantee \naffordable health insurance for every child. We made a good start \ntoward this goal in the 1990s, by enacting the Children's Health \nInsurance Program to cover more low-income children. Now it is time to \nfinish the job.\n  Twelve million Americans who are twenty-one years old or younger have \nno health insurance today. Seven million are already eligible for \nMedicaid or CHIP, but five million are not eligible for these current \nprograms.\n  Every uninsured child represents a national failure. Every uninsured \nchild is at risk for losing the healthy start in life that should be \nbirthright of every American. Every uninsured child is a potential \nsource of heartbreak for parents and other loved ones. Every uninsured \nchild is an American tragedy waiting to happen.\n  This year, three hundred eighty thousand children suffering from \nasthma will never see a doctor. Five hundred thousand children with \nrecurrent earaches will never see a doctor. Five hundred thousand \nchildren with severe sore throats will never see a doctor.\n  Uninsured children pay for their lack of coverage in human suffering, \nunnecessary disability, and even death, and our society pays too. Sick \nchildren cannot learn. Every child whose education is limited or whose \nfuture potential is lost because of avoidable illness is a loss to \nAmerica, because America's children are America's future.\n  The legislation we are introducing today will guarantee coverage for \nevery child twenty-one years of age or younger. It makes health \ninsurance affordable for every family, but it also asks families to \nshare the responsibility of covering their children, when they are able \nto do so.\n  The bill expands Medicaid and CHIP up to 300 percent of poverty. \nFamilies of moderate means will be able to obtain subsidized coverage \nfor their children. Families with incomes above 300 percent of poverty \nwill be able to buy into Medicaid or CHIP for their children, and they \nwill be guaranteed that the cost will not exceed 5 percent of their \nfamily income.\n  The bill also lifts the cap on CHIP funding that has caused some \nStates to limit enrollment. It assists States financially by shifting \ncurrent State spending for children under 100 percent of poverty to the \nFederal government. It requires all States to adopt the proven methods \nthat encourage families to enroll and stay enrolled--methods such as \npresumptive eligibility, the ability to apply on-line or by telephone \nfor the coverage, and coverage for at least twelve months without \neligibility redeterminations.\n  This legislation is vitally important to all children. It is a pledge \nthat they will have access to good health care without regard to their \nfamily's wealth. It is a commitment to a healthy start in life for \nevery child.\n  As important as those objectives are, the significance of this \nlegislation goes beyond coverage of all children. It is a major step \ntoward the day when the basic right to health care will be a reality \nfor every American, whatever their age or income. We will not rest \nuntil that goal is achieved, and I commend Senator Kerry for leading \nthis essential effort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 115. A bill to require Federal agencies, and persons engaged in \ninterstate commerce, in possession of electronic data containing \npersonal information, to disclose any unauthorized acquisition of such \ninformation; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Notification \nof Risk to Personal Data Act of 2005. This legislation will require \nthat individuals are notified when their most sensitive personal \ninformation is stolen from a corporate or government database. This is \nthe second Congress in a row that I have introduced this legislation--\nit is time for us to pass it to give Americans the notice they need to \nprotect themselves from identity thieves.\n  Specifically, the bill would require government or private entities \nto notify individuals if a data breach has compromised their Social \nSecurity number, driver's license number, credit card number, debit \ncard number or financial account numbers.\n  In most cases, if authorities know that someone is a victim of a \ncrime, the victim is notified. But, that isn't the case if an \nindividual's most sensitive personal information is stolen from an \nelectronic database.\n  Measuring the problem of security breaches is difficult, because many \ncompanies never report breaches of their systems for fear that their \nreputation for securing data would be harmed. But, in a survey \nconducted in 2004 by the FBI and the Computer Security Institute, 52 \npercent of respondents reported some level of unauthorized use of their \ncomputer systems. (Source: 2004 CSI/FBI Computer Crime and Security \nSurvey)\n  Data breaches are becoming all too common. Consider the following \nincidents which have compromised the\n\n[[Page S288]]\n\nrecords of hundreds of thousands of Americans.\n  On January 10, 2005, George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia \nnotified 30,000 students that their names, photos and Social Security \nnumbers were taken by an online intruder; (Source: Cnet news, ``Hackers \nSteal ID Info from Virginia University,'' Monday, January 11, 2005)\n  On August 30, 2004, a University of California-Berkeley database \ncontaining the personal information of 600,000 people was penetrated. \nThe computer contained names, addresses, telephone numbers, dates of \nbirth and Social Security numbers; (Source: Associated Press, October \n21, 2004)\n  Already in the new year, cell phone carrier T-Mobile announced that a \nhacker broke into its database and accessed the names and Social \nSecurity numbers of 400 customers. (Source: Cnet News, ``Hacker Had \nLimited Access'' January 12, 2004)\n  Last year, San Diego State University reported that hackers broke \ninto a server, gaining access to names and Social Security numbers for \nmore than 178,000 former and current students, alumni and staff; \n(Source: San Francisco Chronicle, ``Colleges Leaking Confidential \nData,'' April 5, 2004)\n  At the Georgia Institute of Technology, a hacker downloaded \ninformation that could have included names, addresses, phone numbers \nand credit card numbers for about 57,775 people; (Source: San Francisco \nChronicle, ``Colleges Leaking Confidential Data,'' April 5, 2004) and\n  Finally, in 2004, a Florida man and his employees hacked into Acxiom \nCorp.'s computer system for 16 months and stole large amounts of \npersonal information. Christopher Way, a U.S. assistant attorney \ngeneral, said then that the case represents ``what may be the largest \nintrusion of personal data ever.'' (Source: Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, \n``Hacker Accesses Load of Data from Acxiom,'' July 22, 2004)\n  My home State of California has a similar data notification law, on \nwhich my bill today is modeled. But this sort of protection needs to be \nextended to all Americans.\n  I strongly believe Americans should be notified if a hacker gets \naccess to their most personal data. This is both a matter of principle \nand a practical measure to curb identity theft.\n  Let me take a moment to describe the proposed legislation.\n  The Notification of Risk to Personal Data Act will set a national \nstandard for notification of consumers when a data breach occurs.\n  The legislation requires a business or government entity to notify an \nindividual when there is a reasonable basis to conclude that a hacker \nor other criminal has obtained unencrypted personal data maintained by \nthe entity.\n  Personal data is defined by the bill as an individual's Social \nSecurity number, State identification number, driver's license number, \nfinancial account number, or credit card number.\n  The legislation's notification scheme minimizes the burdens on \ncompanies or agencies that must report a data breach. In general, \nnotice would have to be provided to each person whose data was \ncompromised in writing or through e-mail.\n  But there are important exceptions.\n  First, companies that have developed their own reasonable \nnotification policies are given a safe harbor under the bill and are \nexempted from its notification requirements.\n  Second, encrypted data is exempted.\n  Third, where it is too expensive or impractical (e.g., contact \naddress information is incomplete) to notify every individual who is \nharmed, the bill allows entities to send out an alternative form of \nnotice called ``substitute notice.'' Substitute notice includes posting \nnotice on a website or notifying major media. Substitute notice would \nbe triggered if any of the following factors exist:\n  (i) the agency or person demonstrates that the cost of providing \ndirect notice would exceed $250,000;\n  (ii) the affected class of subject persons to be notified exceeds \n500,000; or\n  (iii) the agency or person does not have sufficient contact \ninformation to notify people whose information is at risk.\n  The bill has a tough, but fair enforcement regime. Entities that fail \nto comply with the bill will be subject to fines by the Federal Trade \nCommission of $5,000 per violation or up to $25,000 per day while the \nviolation persists. State Attorneys General can also file suit to \nenforce the statute.\n  Additionally, the bill would allow California's law to remain in \neffect, but preempt conflicting state laws. It is my understanding that \nlegislators in a number of states are developing bills modeled after \nthe California law. Reportedly, some of these bills have requirements \nthat are inconsistent with the California legislation. It is not fair \nto put companies in a situation that forces them to comply with \ndatabase notification laws of 50 different states.\n  A year after California's landmark legislation went into effect, the \nlaw has raised overall awareness of the need to have strong privacy \nprotections in place. Chris Jay Hoofnagle, associate director of the \nnonprofit Electronic Privacy Information Center, said: ``the California \nlaw has given the public a window into a very serious problem of \ninformation security.'' (Source: Associated Press, ``Authorities Probe \nU.C. Hacking Attack,'' October 21, 2004)\n  As Beth Givens, director of the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, points \nout ``if [California] didn't have this law, the vast majority of these \nsituations would go unreported.'' (Source: The Orange County Register, \n``Ingram Micro Discloses Database Break-In,'' May 15, 2004)\n  I strongly believe individuals have a right to be notified when their \nmost sensitive information is compromised--because it is truly their \ninformation. Ask the ordinary person on the street if he or she would \nlike to know if a criminal had illegally gained access to their \npersonal information from a database--the answer will be a resounding \nyes.\n  Enabling consumers to be notified in a timely manner of security \nbreaches involving their personal data will help combat the growing \nscourge of identity theft. If individuals are informed of the theft of \ntheir Social Security numbers or other sensitive information, they can \ntake immediate preventative action.\n  They can place a fraud alert on their credit report to prevent crooks \nfrom obtaining credit cards in their name;\n  They can monitor their credit reports to see if unauthorized activity \nhas occurred;\n  They can cancel any affected financial or consumer or utility \naccounts; and\n  They can change their phone numbers if necessary.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this vitally \nneeded legislation. This bill will give ordinary Americans more control \nand confidence about the safety of their personal information. \nAmericans will have the security of knowing that should a breach occur, \nthey will be notified and be able to take protective action. Thank you, \nMr. President.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 115\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to require the consent of an individual prior to the \nsale and marketing of such individual's personally identifiable \ninformation, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to re-introduce the \n``Privacy Act of 2005.''\n  This legislation would establish, for the first time, a comprehensive \nnational system of privacy protection. This is the second Congress in a \nrow that I have introduced this legislation. Every year that we wait, \nmillions more Americans become victims of identity theft. It is time \nfor us to act.\n  As you know, Mr. President, I have ardently fought for years for \nlegislation to hamper identity theft. Today, this legislation is one of \nthree bills that I am introducing to continue that fight. I am also \nintroducing the Social Security Number Misuse Prevention Act of 2005, \nand the Notification of Risk to Personal Data Act of 2005. I urge my \ncolleagues to pass all of them, to protect Americans from those who \nwould steal our very identities.\n  At the heart of this bill is the requirement that companies may not \nsell consumers' most intimate personal information unless consumers \naffirmatively give their authorization. This is known as ``opt-in.'' \nTherefore, companies must obtain consumers' written consent prior to \nselling their personal health information, financial information, \nSocial Security numbers, and drivers' license data (opt-in). For this \nsensitive data, the bill gives the individual ultimate control over \nwhether\n\n[[Page S290]]\n\nor not his or her information is shared. If an individual does not \nactively decide to permit sharing of personal data, the data is not \ndisclosed.\n  The bill recognizes that different sorts of information deserve \ndifferent levels of protection. For information that is still personal, \nbut not as intimate, the bill allows businesses more flexibility. \nTherefore, for other personal information--names, physical addresses, \ne-mail addresses, telephones, photographs, birth dates, places of \nbirth, and birth certificate numbers--companies can sell the \ninformation so long as consumers receive notice of the companies' \nintent, and an opportunity to object and prohibit the sale of their \ninformation. This is known as ``opt-out.''\n  That is structure of the overall bill. Let me take a moment to go \nover some of the specifics.\n  For financial data, the Privacy Act would tighten the information-\nsharing provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. This legislation \nwould modify that statute, to prohibit the sale or disclosure of \nsensitive personal financial information to third parties unless the \nconsumer affirmatively consents or opts in. The legislation would also \nrequire that banks let consumers opt out of the sharing of their \npersonal financial information with the bank's affiliates or joint \npartners. The bill makes exceptions for vital public safety concerns. \nThe Privacy Act of 2005 also prohibits banks from denying a customer a \nfinancial product or financial service if the consumer withholds \nconsent.\n  For sensitive medical information, this legislation would expand on \nthe Department of Health and Human Services privacy regulations, by \nextending the restrictions placed on ``covered entities'' (health \ninsurers, health providers, and health care clearinghouses) to ``non-\ncovered entities'' (business associates, health researchers, schools or \nuniversities, and life insurers). All of those entities will be able to \nshare information only with the patients' consent.\n  For Social Security numbers, this bill will prohibit the sale or \ndisplay of an individual's Social Security number to the general public \nwithout the individual's express consent, and prohibit federal, state, \nand local governments from displaying the numbers on the Internet, or \nfrom printing them on checks and drivers' licenses. This legislation \nalso recognizes legitimate uses of Social Security numbers, by allowing \nthe sale of Social Security numbers between businesses, or between the \ngovernment and businesses, among other exceptions.\n  This legislation protects the privacy of information regardless of \nthe medium through which it is collected. Therefore, it recognizes that \nboth paper and electronic records are important to protecting the \nidentities of Americans.\n  To minimize the regulatory burden of these privacy rules, the bill \nsets up a safe harbor so that industries that established approved \npolicies will be exempt from some regulatory requirements of the \nlegislation.\n  To ensure uniformity of the laws across all 50 states, the bill \npreempts inconsistent state laws regarding the treatment of non-\nsensitive information.\n  I note that this legislation is modeled on the California Financial \nInformation Privacy Act, which gives consumers the right to require \ntheir consent before financial companies share their most intimate \ndata. The plan is a good one for Californians, and it is a good one for \nall Americans. The fact that the California law is under assault in the \ncourts makes it all the more vital that the uniform, national standard \nI introduce today becomes law.\n  I want to give a sense of why this legislation is so necessary. \nRecent statistics on the growth of identity theft show we have no time \nto waste in protecting personal privacy.\n  For years, identity theft has topped the list of complaints reported \nto the Federal Trade Commission. In 2003, the Commission received over \nhalf a million such complaints, about 42 percent of the total. While \nthe FTC will not report its numbers for 2004 until early February, I \nunfortunately expect to again see identity theft as the cause of the \nmost complaints.\n  According to a 2003 report from the FTC, 10 million Americans \ndiscovered that year their identities had been stolen. The report also \nstated that consumers have to spend an average of 30 hours to clear \ntheir name; The Identity Theft Resource Center puts the number at 175 \nhours. And as Attorney General John Ashcroft said last August, \n``Identity theft costs the nation's businesses nearly $50 billion a \nyear in fraudulent transactions and often involves coordinated criminal \nconduct.''\n  My own State, California, has more victims of identity theft than any \nother state. The FTC recorded 39,452 complaints of identity theft cases \nin 2003 in California alone.\n  But the numbers tell only part of the story. More important are the \nindividual people whose lives have been devastated by identity theft. \nLet me tell just one story that I find particularly disturbing:\n  Eric Drew was a patient in a hospital receiving a bone marrow \ntransplant. Yet unbeknownst to him, a worker in the hospital had stolen \nDrew's identity, and had taken advantage of this sick patient. As the \nAssociated Press reported, ``Drew said that while he was lying in a \nhospital bed, dying from cancer and weak from massive doses of \nchemotherapy, he began to get mail thanking him for opening accounts he \nknew nothing about.'' In this case, luckily, the criminal was caught \nand convicted.\n  Since I introduced this legislation for the first time in the 108th \nCongress, there are millions more stories like this one.\n  Indeed, there are also new common methods of identity theft. There \nhas been a massive upswing in the phenomenon known as ``Phishing,'' in \nwhich criminals send emails to people, spoofed to fraudulently look \nlike emails from banks and other financial institutions. These emails \ntell consumers to click on a Web page, and then to enter their name, \naccount numbers, passwords, and other sensitive financial information. \nThe criminals then use this information not only to steal from the \nunwitting consumers, but to literally lock them out of their own \naccounts. This one sort of identity theft has, according to a December \nstudy from e-mail security company MessageLabs, increased by almost \ntenfold over the last year.\n  Given the grave risks that technology poses to our privacy, it is our \nresponsibility to start taking action. This is especially the case for \nolder Americans, who are disproportionately vulnerable to identity \ntheft, as I tried to highlight last year by cosponsoring the \n``Protecting Older Americans From Fraud Month'' resolution last \nOctober.\n  I would like to highlight some of the key provisions of the law.\n  For financial information this legislation tightens the privacy \nprovisions of the Financial Services Modernization Act, commonly known \nas the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. Under Gramm-Leach-Bliley, a bank can \nshare a customer's personal information with other companies so long as \nit gives consumers notice and the right to opt-out of the data sharing.\n  The problem with the prevailing opt-out is that most people throw \naway their privacy notices from banks along with the rest of the \nunrelenting pile of commercial solicitations they receive. Since the \npassage of Gramm-Leach-Bliley, banks have sent out over one billion \nprivacy notices.\n  According to available published information, fewer than 5 percent of \nbank customers have opted out of sharing their personal information, \nand for many financial institutions, the response rate has been less \nthan one percent.\n  Accordingly, this legislation prohibits the sale or disclosure of \nsensitive personal financial information to third parties unless the \nconsumer affirmatively consents or opts in--the burden thus shifts off \nof the consumer.\n  This legislation also toughens Federal financial privacy laws for \naffiliate-sharing and joint-marketing. An affiliate is a company that \nis linked by common ownership with another company. Under Federal law, \na bank can share with affiliates or joint marketing partners regardless \nof whether the consumer wants this information shared.\n  This legislation would require that banks give consumers the option \nof opting out of the sharing of their personal financial information \nwith the bank's affiliates or joint partners.\n  I would also like to describe several other key components of the \nfinancial privacy section.\n\n[[Page S291]]\n\n  The bill prohibits banks from denying a customer a financial product \nor financial service just because the customer chooses to not disclose \nhis personal information to third parties, affiliates, or joint venture \npartners. However, the bill does allow banks to offer incentives to \ncustomers to encourage them to permit the sharing of their personal \ninformation.\n  Additionally, the bill permits banks to disclose, but not sell, \npersonal information to third parties for vital public interest \npurposes such as identifying or locating missing and abducted children, \nwitnesses, criminals and fugitives, parents delinquent in child support \npayments, organ and bone marrow donors, pension fund beneficiaries, and \nmissing heirs.\n\n  Just as with financial data, personal health and medical data \ndeserves the most stringent privacy protections.\n  The recently adopted Department of Health and Human Services privacy \nregulations set a basic opt-in framework for disclosure of health \ninformation. But more can be done to protect patient privacy.\n  The regulations only prohibit ``covered entities''--namely health \ninsurers, health providers, and health care clearinghouse--from selling \na patient's health information without that patient's prior consent.\n  Meanwhile, non-covered entities--such as business associates, health \nresearchers, schools or universities, and life insurers--are not \nsubject to this opt-in requirement, except through contractual \narrangements.\n  This legislation would preserve the privacy of health information \nwherever the information is sold. Any business associate, life insurer, \nschool or non-covered entity trying to sell or market protected health \ninformation would, like covered entities, have to get the patient's \nprior consent. This is a crucial step to protect what is truly our most \nintimate information.\n  Drivers' license data also are given the strongest level of \nprotection under this bill.\n  The Driver's Privacy Protection Act, DPPA was amended in 2000 to \noffer some meaningful protections for drivers' privacy.\n  For example, under the DPPA, a State Department of Motor Vehicles \nmust obtain the prior consent (opt-in) of the driver before ``highly \nsensitive information''--defined as a physical copy of the license, a \nSocial Security number, medical or disability information, and other \ninformation can be disclosed to a third party.\n  However, loopholes remain. Other sensitive information found on a \ndriver's license deserves equal protection.\n  This legislation would expand the definition of ``highly sensitive \ninformation'' to include a physical copy of a driver's license, the \ndriver identification number, birth date, information on the driver's \nphysical characteristics and any biometric identifiers, such as a \nfingerprint, that are found on the driver's license.\n  Thus, this bill would ensure consumers have control over how their \nmotor vehicle records and driver's license data are used.\n  I would like to take a moment to highlight the Social Security number \nsection of this legislation. I have also introduced this section as a \nstand-alone bill, the ``Social Security Number Misuse Prevention Act of \n2005.''\n  It is crucial to protect Social Security numbers because Social \nSecurity numbers are the key to a person's identity. Many identity \ntheft cases start with the theft of a Social Security number. Once a \nthief has access to a victim's Social Security number, it is only a \nshort step to acquiring credit cards, driver's licenses, or other \ncrucial identification documents.\n  This legislation bars the sale or display of Social Security numbers \nto the public except in a very narrow set of circumstances. In general \ndisplay or sale is permitted only if the Social Security number holder \naffirmatively consents or if there are compelling public safety needs. \nGovernment entities will have to redact Social Security numbers from \nelectronic records that are readily available to the public on the \nInternet. State governments will no longer be permitted to use the \nSocial Security number as the default driver's license number.\n  The legislation, however, recognizes that some industries rely on \nSocial Security numbers to exchange information for certain \ntransactions.\n  Thus, the bill directs the Attorney General to develop regulations \nallowing for the sale or purchase of Social Security Numbers to \nfacilitate business-to-business and business-to-government \ntransactions, so long as businesses put appropriate safeguards in place \nand do not permit public access to the number.\n  This legislation codifies steps Congress can take to protect citizens \nfrom identity thieves and other predators of personal information.\n  It restores to an individual more control over her most sensitive \npersonal information, such as Social Security numbers, health \ninformation, and financial information. It also sets reasonable \nguidelines for businesses that handle our personal information every \nday. Every American has a fundamental right to privacy, no matter how \nfast our technology grows or changes.\n  Last year, President Bush signed into law the Identity Theft Penalty \nEnhancement Act, legislation that I helped to write, to increase \npunishment on people who steal others' identities. I am proud of my \nwork to make that bill into a law. But we all must realize that \npunishment is no substitute for prevention. My legislation today will \nmake fewer suffer from identity theft in the first place.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact this \nlegislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 116\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Such regulations shall prescribe \n     sanctions for noncompliance, require that such department or \n     agency provide notice of failure to comply with such section \n     prior to any action being taken against such recipient, and \n     require that a determination be made prior to any action \n     being taken against such recipient that compliance cannot be \n     secured by voluntary means.\n       (2) Federal financial assistance.--The term ``Federal \n     financial assistance'' means assistance through a grant, \n     cooperative agreement, loan, or contract other than a \n     contract of insurance or guaranty.\n\n     SEC. 103.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The inappropriate display, sale, or purchase of social \n     security numbers has contributed to a growing range of \n     illegal activities, including fraud, identity theft, and, in \n     some cases, stalking and other violent crimes.\n       (2) While financial institutions, health care providers, \n     and other entities have often used social security numbers to \n     confirm the identity of an individual, the general display to \n     the public, sale, or purchase of these numbers has been used \n     to commit crimes, and also can result in serious invasions of \n     individual privacy.\n       (3) The Federal Government requires virtually every \n     individual in the United States to obtain and maintain a \n     social security number in order to pay taxes, to qualify for \n     social security benefits, or to seek employment. An \n     unintended consequence of these requirements is that social \n     security numbers have become one of the tools that can be \n     used to facilitate crime, fraud, and invasions of the privacy \n     of the individuals to whom the numbers are assigned. Because \n     the Federal Government created and maintains this system, and \n     because the Federal Government does not permit individuals to \n     exempt themselves from those requirements, it is appropriate \n     for the Federal Government to take steps to stem the abuse of \n     social security numbers.\n       (4) The display, sale, or purchase of social security \n     numbers in no way facilitates uninhibited, robust, and wide-\n     open public debate, and restrictions on such display, sale, \n     or purchase would not affect public debate.\n       (5) No one should seek to profit from the display, sale, or \n     purchase of social security numbers in circumstances that \n     create a substantial risk of physical, emotional, or \n     financial harm to the individuals to whom those numbers are \n     assigned.\n       (6) Consequently, this title provides each individual that \n     has been assigned a social security number some degree of \n     protection from the display, sale, and purchase of that \n     number in any circumstance that might facilitate unlawful \n     conduct.\n\n     SEC. 202.

A bill to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to extend \nloan forgiveness for certain loans to Head Start teachers; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President. I rise today with Senator Voinovich to \nintroduce legislation to expand the federal loan forgiveness program to \ninclude Head Start teachers.\n  Nationwide, only 30 percent of Head Start teachers have completed a \nbaccalaureate or advanced degree program.\n  In California, that number is even smaller: about eighteen percent of \nHead Start teachers have completed a bachelor's degree.\n  To prepare Head Start children for elementary school, we must recruit \nhighly qualified teachers who have demonstrated knowledge and teaching \nskills in reading, writing, early childhood development, and other \nareas of the preschool curriculum with a particular focus on cognitive \nlearning.\n  Recruiting and maintaining teachers with such qualifications is the \nonly way to jump-start cognitive development and ensure that our \nchildren start elementary school ready to learn.\n  A survey conducted by the U.S. Department of Health and Human \nServices called the Head Start Family and Child Experiences Survey \n(FACES) found a strong relationship between the education of Head Start \nteachers and classroom quality. Teachers with higher education levels \nwere found to be more sensitive and responsive to their children, to \nhave more high quality language activities, and more creative \nactivities in their classrooms.\n\n  Teachers with higher levels of education also had classes with higher \nquality language activities such as reading books for the children and \nprovided more opportunities for children to develop skills in \nexpressing thoughts.\n  Head Start is the primary federal program that has the potential to \nreach out to low-income children early in their formative years when \ntheir cognitive skills are just developing.\n  We know that poor children disproportionately start school behind \ntheir peers--they are less likely to count to 10 or to recite the \nalphabet.\n  Many of our nation's youngsters enter elementary school without the \nbasic skills necessary to succeed. Often these children lag behind \ntheir peers throughout their academic career.\n  As taxpayers, we will spend millions on efforts to help these \nchildren catch up. Many of these children will never catch up. A recent \nnational study by The High/Scope Perry Preschool confirms the \nimportance of providing preschool children with the opportunity early \non to gain the basic skills necessary for school.\n  The study found that preschoolers were more likely to graduate from \nhigh school and be employed at age 40, earn more money a year, and were \nmore likely to own a home and have a savings account.\n\n  We can save millions by providing low-income children with access to \nquality preschool where they will gain the necessary skills to succeed \nin school and life.\n  In order to give every child a head start in life, we must continue \nto recruit highly qualified teachers to the Head Start field and \nprevent the best teachers from leaving.\n  Many Head Start programs across the country, including in California, \nare losing qualified teachers to local school districts in part because \nthe pay is better.\n  Nationally, the average Head Start teacher earns a salary of $21,287 \ncompared to $43,152 for an elementary school teacher.\n  Head Start teachers are making half of what elementary school \nteachers are paid on average.\n  Low pay, combined with increasing student debt, is a real deterrent \nto getting college graduates to become Head Start teachers.\n  And every teacher that Head Start loses impacts the quality and \naccess to services for our nation's low-income children.\n  One way to recruit and retain highly qualified Head Start teachers is \nto offer incentives to pursue a career in this field.\n  Current law allows elementary and secondary school teachers to \nreceive up to $5,000 in loan forgiveness in exchange for five years of \nservice.\n  We believe Head Start teachers should be given this same opportunity.\n  The legislation we are introducing today is meant to encourage recent \ngraduates, current Head Start teachers without a degree, and college \nstudents to enter and remain in the Head Start field.\n  In exchange for 5 years of service, a Head Start teacher could \nreceive up to $5,000 of their federal loans forgiven.\n  We must continue to improve the Head Start program so that children \nwill have the necessary cognitive skills when they leave the program, \nsuch as being able to count to ten, begin to recite the alphabet, and \nrecognize sizes and colors.\n  This is just the first step. To further ensure cognitive learning, we \nmust also continue to raise the standards and pay for Head Start \nteachers.\n  Providing our nation's low-income children with access to highly \neducated and qualified teachers so that they enter school ready to \nlearn is critical to their future success and should be a priority of \nthis Congress.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of the legislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 117\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join my friend and \ncolleague from California, Senator Dianne Feinstein, in introducing \nvery important legislation that I believe will encourage young teachers \nto go into early childhood education, improve the qualifications of \ncurrent early educators, and lead to a better education for our \nNation's youngest children.\n  Study after study on human development has found that there is no \nmore important time in a child's life than their earliest years. In \nfact, the learning opportunities in these years have a critical and \ndecisive impact on the development of the brain and on the nature and \nextent of their adult capacities.\n  To maximize their potential, we must begin to teach our children the \nnecessary learning skills they will utilize throughout their lives as \nearly as possible; well before they reach kindergarten.\n  I know of few other programs that have the same potential to meet \nthis goal as Head Start.\n  When I was Governor of Ohio, we invested heavily in Head Start, \nincreasing funding from $18 million in 1990, to $180 million in 1998.\n  By the time I left office, there was a space available for every \neligible child in Ohio whose parents wanted them in a Head Start or \npre-school program, and because of our efforts, Ohio led the Nation in \nterms of children served by Head Start.\n  Now that I am in the Senate, I continue to believe that it is \nabsolutely critical that we do more to help our young people prepare to \nbegin school ``ready to learn.''\n  The results of a survey undertaken by the U.S. Department of Health \nand Human Services in 1999 and 2000 has shown a significant correlation \nbetween the quality of education a child receives and the amount of \neducation that child's teacher possesses.\n  Unfortunately, nationwide, just 30 percent of Head Start teachers \nhave earned a baccalaureate or advanced degree.\n  Under Ohio law, by 2007, all Head Start teachers must have at least \nan associate's degree. It is hoped that this requirement will encourage \nHead Start educators to pursue a bachelor's or even an advanced degree. \nAfter all, the more education our teachers have, the better off our \nchildren will be.\n  Unfortunately, as we all know, education can be expensive.\n  The bill we are introducing is designed to encourage currently \nenrolled and incoming college students working on a bachelor's or a \nmaster's degree to pursue a career as a Head Start teacher. It is also \nintended to assist current Head Start teachers, who wish to pursue a \ndegree, to remain in the field.\n  In exchange for a 5-year teaching commitment in a qualified Head \nStart program, a college graduate with a minimum of a bachelor's degree \ncould receive up to $5,000 in forgiveness for their Federal student \nloan. Current law already permits elementary and secondary educators to \nreceive this type of loan forgiveness. It is time to give Head Start \nteachers this same opportunity.\n  Recruiting and retaining Head Start and early childhood teachers \ncontinues to be a challenge for Ohio and other States. This is not \nsurprising. On average, Head Start teachers earn about half of the \naverage salary of kindergarten teachers. For Head Start providers, this \nfinancial difference combined with the growing cost of a college \neducation and student debt makes it difficult to recruit quality \nteachers.\n  This bill will help communities, schools and other funded Head Start \nproviders to meet the challenge of recruiting and retaining high \nquality teachers. It is one of the best ways that I know of where we \ncan make a real difference in the lives of our most precious resource, \nour children.\n  One of the best uses of our Federal education resources is to target \nthem toward our youngest citizens where they can have the most impact.\n  I am pleased to have been able to work with my colleague Senator \nFeinstein on this legislation, and I ask for my colleagues' support.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 118. A bill for the relief of Maria Cristina DeGrassi; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I offer today private relief \nlegislation to provide lawful permanent residence status to Maria \nCristina Degrassi, a 37-year-old severely disabled Italian national \ncurrently living with her family in San Mateo, California.\n  I have decided to offer private relief legislation on Ms. Degrassi's \nbehalf because I believe that her removal from the United States would \nbe tragically unfair not only to her, but to her sister and brother-in-\nlaw, Daniela Degrassi and Luca Prasso, who reside legally in the United \nStates and who are Ms. Degrassi's closest family and only willing \ncaregivers.\n  Ms. Degrassi has legally resided in the United States since 1997 on a \nnon-immigrant tourist visa. However, she is not like an ordinary \ntourist. She cannot enjoy California's beautiful coastline or stunning \nmountain ranges. She cannot tour Hollywood movie studios or Napa Valley \nwineries. Ms. Degrassi was born premature in 1965 and, consequently, is \nseverely mentally handicapped and autistic. Because of these \ndisabilities, Ms. Degrassi has the mental capacity of a two-year old, \ncannot speak and understands only a few sentences in Italian.\n  In addition to these challenges, Ms. Degrassi was diagnosed with \ndiabetes in 2001 and now requires daily insulin shots and a carefully \nmonitored diet.\n  For Ms. Degrassi, the sum of these health problems means that she \nmust have 24-hour-a-day, 7-day-a-week personal care and attention. \nLuckily, however, there are two people in Ms. Degrassi's life who are \nmore than happy not only to care for her daily needs, but to love and \nnurture her.\n  Ms. Degrassi's sister, Daniela, and her brother-in-law, Luca, are \nlegal permanent residents of the United States. Mr. Prasso is a highly \nskilled and valued employee of PDI-DreamWorks, the world renowned movie \nproduction company. Serving as a Character Technical Supervisor and \nearning nearly $200,000 per year, Mr. Prasso has worked on such \ncritically acclaimed films as ``Shrek'' and ``ANTZ.'' In the course of \nthat work, Mr. Prasso has developed and patented new technologies and \nbecome a leader in his field. In a letter in support of this private \nlegislation, DreamWorks referred to Mr. Prasso's skills as ``rar[e]'' \nand ``irreplaceable.''\n  Daniela Degrassi has also excelled in the United States, starting a \nsuccessful freelance photography career and business.\n  Together, Mr. Prasso and Daniela Degrassi have provided Ms. Degrassi \nwith the love, care and attention that she so desperately needs. When \nMs. Degrassi's father and aunt died in 1997, the couple knew that they \nwere the only family left who was willing to care for her. The choice \nfor them was clear. Mr. Prasso wrote in a letter he sent me, ``My wife \nand I then faced a big decision. We refuse[d] completely to put her in \nan institution. We [could not] accept the idea of not being able to \nproperly take care of her. No other relative was alive or came forward \nto offer help. We were the only and closest persons to Cristina. We \ndecided to take care of her like a daughter.''\n\n  For the past seven years, Mr. Prasso and Daniela Degrassi have done \njust that, organizing their lives around caring for and attending to \nMs. Degrassi.\n\n[[Page S303]]\n\nThey cook for her and clothe and bathe her on a daily basis. Because of \nthe close monitoring Ms. Degrassi's diabetic condition requires, when \nthe couple wants to go out to dinner or see a movie, they must do so \nseparately so that one of them is always with Ms. Degrassi in case of \nan emergency.\n  Despite the hardships that caring for Ms. Degrassi have imposed upon \nMr. Prasso and Daniela Degrassi, the experience has deeply enriched \ntheir lives. In Mr. Prasso's letter, he wrote, ``despite my long work \nhours and my wife['s] new successful business as a photographer, we are \nable and fully committed to continue to take care [of Cristina] 24 \nhours a day . . . The reward of a kiss, hug or smile from Cristina is \nan amazing thing and makes all the pain disappear.''\n  Unfortunately, if this private relief bill is not approved, this \nwonderful family will face a tragic set of choices. Since 1997, Ms. \nDegrassi has applied for and always received six-month extensions of \nher non-immigrant tourist visa. The Degrassi's lawyer has informed the \ncouple that approval of the current extension is unlikely and has \nrecommended they withdraw their petition. This would leave Ms. Degrassi \nwith nothing. There are no other avenues available for her to remain in \nthe United States lawfully. In short, if this private relief \nlegislation is not approved, Ms. Degrassi will be forced to return to \nItaly.\n  However, Mr. Prasso and Daniela Degrassi's love for their sister will \nnever allow her to return to Italy alone. Faced with Ms. Degrassi's \nremoval, the couple will leave their lives in California and move back \nwith her in order to continue to provide the care and attention on \nwhich Ms. Degrassi depends.\n  The consequences of such a move will be tragic for this family. It \nwill mean the end of Mr. Prasso's highly accomplished career with \nDreamWorks, as well as, the end of the photography career Daniela \nDegrassi has worked so hard to build. In addition, both Mr. Prasso and \nDaniela Degrassi are eligible to become United States citizens this \nyear.\n  I can think of no compelling reasons why the United States should not \nenable this family to continue as they have in California. Because of \nthe substantial salary that Mr. Prasso and Daniela Degrassi earn and \nbecause of the monthly pension Ms. Degrassi receives, due to her \ndisability, from the Italian government, there is almost no chance that \nMs. Degrassi will become a burden on the state or federal government.\n  In Mr. Prasso's letter to me, he made this simple request, ``We are \nlooking forward to find[ing] a permanent solution to this dilemma that \ndoes not involve dismembering this family or giving up on a wonderful \njob. A solution that will allow us to live a normal life like a normal \nfamily.''\n  We can make this solution a reality for Ms. Degrassi and this \nwonderful family. For that reason, I offer this private relief \nlegislation and ask my colleagues to support it.\n  Given these extraordinary and unique facts, I ask my colleagues to \nsupport this private relief bill on behalf of Ms. Degrassi.\n  I also ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 118\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for the protection of unaccompanied alien \nchildren, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I introduce today the ``Unaccompanied \nAlien Child Protection Act of 2005'', legislation to reform the way the \nfederal government treats unaccompanied alien children who are \napprehended by federal immigration officials at our borders or within \nthe United States.\n  I first introduced legislation similar to this bill during the 107th \nCongress and still strongly believe that its passage is necessary to \nensure the proper treatment of unaccompanied alien children within our \nfederal system. With each passing year, as members realize the \nnecessity for this legislation, the bill has moved further along in the \nprocess.\n  I am pleased to be joined by Senators Collins, Schumer, Hagel, \nDurbin, DeWine, Cantwell, Inouye and Feingold as original co-sponsors \nof this legislation.\n  During the 108th Congress, the ``Unaccompanied Alien Child Protection \nAct'' passed the Senate by unanimous consent, after garnering no less \nthan 34 co-sponsors. Unfortunately, the bill stalled in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  So today I re-introduce this legislation, and again, this will be one \nof my top legislative priorities because I believe we have a special \nobligation to ensure that every child that comes into contact with \nfederal officials is afforded fair and humane treatment.\n  In 2004, approximately 6,200 unaccompanied alien children were \napprehended by Department of Homeland Security officials and \ntransferred to the care of the Office of Refugee Resettlement within \nthe Department of Health and Human Services. This number has grown over \nthe years and shows no signs of abating.\n  Thousands of foreign-born children under the age of 18 enter the \nUnited States each year unaccompanied by parents or other legal \nguardians. These children are among the most vulnerable of the \nimmigrant population and these numbers are going to continue to grow \ngiven the greater emphasis on enforcement actions by immigration \nofficials--which I support--and the relatively unchanged conditions \nbringing them here.\n  These children are from all over the world, although the majority \nencountered by immigration officials today are from Honduras, Guatemala \nand El Salvador. Some are asylum seekers fleeing human rights abuses \nand armed conflict in their homelands. Others are fleeing abuses \nspecific to children, such as forced recruitment of child soldiers, \nforced prostitution and servitude, sexual slavery and exploitation, \nchild labor, abuse of street children, child brides and female genital \nmutilation. Yet other children come to the United States because they \nhave been abused, abandoned or neglected by their parents or \ncaregivers. And finally, some come seeking to reunify with family \nmembers already in the United States or seeking a better life.\n  Historically, U.S. immigration law and policies have been developed \nand implemented without regard to their effect on children. This result \nhas been similar to trying to fit a square peg in a round hole--it just \ndoesn't work.\n  Under current immigration law, these children are forced to struggle \nthrough a system designed for adults, even though they lack the \ncapacity to understand nuanced legal principles or courtroom and \nadministrative procedures. Because of this, children who may very well \nbe eligible for relief are often vulnerable to being deported back to \nthe very life-threatening situations from which they fled--before they \nare even able to make their cases before the Department of Homeland \nSecurity or an immigration judge.\n  Prior to March 1, 2003, the Immigration and Naturalization Service \nhad responsibility for the care, custody and treatment of unaccompanied \nalien children. Unfortunately, the Immigration and Naturalization \nService fell short in\n\n[[Page S304]]\n\nfulfilling these responsibilities. The legislation that I am \nintroducing today builds on Section 462 of Public Law 107-296, the \nHomeland Security Act of 2002, which provided for the transfer of \nresponsibility for the care and placement of unaccompanied alien \nchildren from the now-abolished Immigration and Naturalization Service \nto the Office of Refugee Resettlement within the Department of Health \nand Human Services.\n  Section 462 was based on S. 121, comprehensive legislation relating \nto unaccompanied alien children that I introduced during the 107th \nCongress.\n  With the enactment of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, we set into \nmotion the centralization of responsibility for the care and custody of \nunaccompanied alien children with the Office of Refugee Resettlement. \nThe first phase of this transfer of responsibility occurred on March 1, \n2003. Once the transition was completed, we finally resolved the \nconflict of interest inherent in the former system which pitted the \nenforcement side of the Immigration and Naturalization Service against \nthe benefits side of that same agency in the care of unaccompanied \nalien children.\n  I am pleased that the provision transferring responsibility for the \ncare and custody of unaccompanied alien children was contained in the \nHomeland Security Act and that by all accounts the transition in the \ncare of children between the affected agencies has gone well.\n  But, the transfer of authority to the Office of Refugee \nResettlement--by itself--is not enough to ensure that these children \nare treated fairly and humanely. Congress now has a responsibility to \ngo beyond the simple transfer to actually laying out the process and \nsteps to ensure that unaccompanied alien children are treated fairly \nand humanely. We must provide the Office of Refugee Resettlement, the \nDepartment of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice with the \ntools they will need to succeed in their missions regarding the care of \nunaccompanied alien children after the transfer of jurisdiction took \nplace.\n  First of all, I want to stress that this bill is not about benefits, \nas it provides no new immigration benefit to unaccompanied alien \nchildren. Rather, this bill is about the process of how we treat these \nchildren.\n  The ``Unaccompanied Alien Child Protection Act'' provides guidance \nand instruction to the Office of Refugee Resettlement, the Department \nof Homeland Security and the Department of Justice in the following \nareas:\n  First, in the custody, release, family reunification and detention of \nunaccompanied alien children;\n  Second, it provides access by unaccompanied alien children to \nguardians ad litem and pro bono counsel;\n  Third, it streamlines the Special Immigrant Juvenile (SIJ) program \nand provides guidance on the training of federal government officials \nand private parties who come into contact with unaccompanied alien \nchildren;\n  Fourth, it requires the issuance of guidelines specific to children's \nasylum claims;\n  Fifth, it authorizes appropriations for the care of unaccompanied \nalien children; and\n  Sixth, it amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to provide \nadditional responsibilities and powers to the Office of Refugee \nResettlement with respect to unaccompanied alien children.\n  Central throughout the ``Unaccompanied Alien Child Protection Act'' \nare two concepts:\n  The United States government has a fundamental responsibility to \nprotect unaccompanied children in its custody; and in all proceedings \nand actions, the government should have as a priority protecting the \ninterests of these children.\n  I first became involved in this issue in 2000 when I heard about a \nyoung 15-year old Chinese girl who stood before a U.S. immigration \ncourt facing deportation proceedings with her hands chained to her \nwaist, like a criminal. She had found her way to the United States as a \nstowaway in a container ship captured off of Guam, hoping to escape the \nrepression she had experienced in her home country.\n  She had been placed on a boat bound for the United States by her very \nown parents, fleeing China's rigid family planning laws. Under these \nlaws, she was denied citizenship, education and medical care. She came \nto this country alone and desperate.\n  And what did our immigration authorities do when they found her? The \nImmigration and Naturalization Service detained her in a juvenile jail \nin Portland, Oregon for eight months before her asylum hearing, and \nmore than seven weeks after she was granted asylum.\n  At her asylum hearing, the young girl stood before a judge, \nunrepresented by counsel, confused and unable to understand the \nproceedings against her. She could not wipe away the tears from her \nface because her hands were chained to her waist. According to a lawyer \nwho later came to represent her, ``her only crime was that her parents \nhad put her on a boat so she could get a better life over here.''\n  While the young girl eventually received asylum in our country, she \nunnecessarily faced an ordeal no child should bear under our \nimmigration system. This young Chinese girl represents only one of the \nmore than 6,000 foreign-born children who, without parents or legal \nguardians to protect them, are discovered in the United States each \nyear in need of protection.\n  This is unacceptable treatment and we have a responsibility to do \nbetter than this.\n  Imagine the fear of an unaccompanied alien child, in the United \nStates alone, without a parent or guardian. Imagine that child being \nthrust into a system he or she does not understand, provided no access \nto pro bono counsel or guardians ad litem, placed in jail with adults \nor housed with juveniles with serious criminal convictions. I find it \nhard to believe that our country would allow children to be treated in \nsuch a manner.\n  That is why I am introducing this legislation today. The \n``Unaccompanied Alien Child Protection Act'' will help our country \nfulfill the special obligation to these children to treat them fairly \nand humanely.\n  I am proud to have the support of the United States Conference of \nCatholic Bishops, the Women's Commission on Refugee Women and Children, \nthe Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, Amnesty International USA \nand the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, and many other \norganizations with whom I have worked closely to develop this \nlegislation.\n  I urge my colleagues to join with me by cosponsoring this important \nmeasure and ensuring that these reforms are finally enacted.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 119\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill for the relief of Esidronio Arreola-Saucedo, Maria \nElna Cobian Arreola, Nayely Bibiana Arreola, and Cindy Jael Arreola; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I offer today private immigration \nrelief legislation to provide lawful permanent residence status to \nEsidronio Arreola-Saucedo, Maria Elena Cobian Arreola, Nayely Bibiana \nArreola and Cindy Jael Arreola, Mexican nationals living in the Fresno \narea of California.\n  Mr. and Mrs. Arreola have lived in the United States for almost 20 \nyears. Two of their five children, Nayely, age 18, and Cindy, age 16, \nalso stand to benefit from this legislation. Their other three \nchildren, Roberto, age 13, Daniel, age 9, and Saray, age 8, are United \nStates citizens. Today, Mr. and Mrs. Arreola and their two eldest \nchildren face deportation.\n  The story of the Arreola family is compelling and I believe they \nmerit Congress's special consideration for such an extraordinary form \nof relief as a private bill.\n  The Arreolas are in this uncertain situation in part because of \ngrievous errors committed by their previous counsel, who has since been \ndisbarred. In fact, the attorney's conduct was so egregious that it \ncompelled an immigration judge to write the Executive Office of \nImmigration Review seeking his disbarment for the detriment he caused \nhis immigration clients.\n  Mr. Arreola has lived in the United States since 1986. He was an \nagricultural migrant worker in the fields of California for several \nyears, and as such would have been eligible for permanent residence \nthrough the Seasonal Agricultural Workers, SAW, program had he known \nabout it.\n  Mrs. Arreola was living in the United States at the time she became \npregnant with her daughter Cindy, but returned to Mexico to give birth \nso as to avoid any problems with the Immigration and Naturalization \nService.\n  Given the length of time that the Arreolas had, and have been, in the \nUnited States it is quite likely that they would have qualified for \nrelief from deportation pursuant to the cancellation of removal \nprovisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act, but for the conduct \nof their previous attorney.\n  Perhaps one of the most compelling reasons for permitting the family \nto remain in the United States is the devastating impact their \ndeportation would have on their children--three of whom are U.S. \ncitizens, as I stated earlier, and the other two who have lived in the \nUnited States since they were toddlers. For these children, this \ncountry is the only country they really know.\n  Nayely, the oldest, is a freshman at Fresno Pacific University. She \nwas the first in her family to graduate from high school and the first \nto attend college. She attends Fresno Pacific University, a regionally \nranked university, on a full tuition scholarship package and works \npart-time in the admissions office.\n  At her young age, Nayely has demonstrated a strong commitment to the \nideals of citizenship in her adopted country. She has worked hard to \nachieve her full potential both in her academic endeavors and through \nthe service she provides her community. As the Associate Dean of \nEnrollment Services, Cary Templeton, at Fresno Pacific University \nstates in a letter of support, ``[t]he leaders of Fresno Pacific \nUniversity saw in Nayely, a young person who will become exemplary of \nall that is good in the American dream.''\n  In high school, Nayely was a member of Advancement Via Individual \nDetermination, AVID, a college preparatory program in which students \ncommit to determining their own futures through achieving a college \ndegree. Nayely was also president of the Key Club, a community service \norganization. She helped mentor freshmen and participates in several \nother student organizations in her school. Perhaps the greatest \nhardship to this family, if forced to return to Mexico, will be her \nlost opportunity to realize her dreams and further contribute to her \ncommunity and to this country.\n  It is clear to me that Nayely feels a strong sense of responsibility \nfor her community and country. By all indications, this is the case as \nwell for all of the members of her family.\n  The Arreolas also have other family who are lawful permanent \nresidents of this country or United States citizens. Mrs. Arreola has \nthree brothers who are U.S. citizens and Mr. Arreola has a sister who \nis a U.S. citizen. It is also my understanding that they have no \nimmediate family in Mexico.\n  According to immigration authorities, this family has never had any \nproblems with law enforcement. I am told that they have filed their \ntaxes for every year from 1990 to the present. They have always worked \nhard to support themselves. As I previously mentioned, Mr. Arreola was \npreviously employed as a farm worker, but now has his own business \nrepairing electronics. His business has been successful enough to \nenable him to purchase a home for his family.\n\n[[Page S310]]\n\n  It seems so clear to me that this family has embraced the American \ndream and their continued presence in our country would do so much to \nenhance the values we hold dear. Enactment of the legislation I have \nintroduced today will enable the Arreolas to continue to make \nsignificant contributions to their community as well as the United \nStates.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this private bill. I also ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed in the \nRecord and that the three letters of community support be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 120\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. ADJUSTMENT OF STATUS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law \n     or any order, for the purposes of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.), Esidronio Arreola-\n     Saucedo, Maria Elna Cobian Arreola, Nayely Bibiana Arreola, \n     and Cindy Jael Arreola shall be deemed to have been lawfully \n     admitted to, and remained in, the United States, and shall be \n     eligible for issuance of an immigrant visa or for adjustment \n     of status under section 245 of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1255).\n       (b) Application and Payment of Fees.--Subsection (a) shall \n     apply only if the applications for issuance of immigrant \n     visas or the applications for adjustment of status are filed \n     with appropriate fees within 2 years after the date of \n     enactment of this Act.\n       (c) Reduction of Immigrant Visa Numbers.--Upon the granting \n     of immigrant visas to Esidronio Arreola-Saucedo, Maria Elna \n     Cobian Arreola, Nayely Bibiana Arreola, and Cindy Jael \n     Arreola, the Secretary of State shall instruct the proper \n     officer to reduce by 4, during the current or subsequent \n     fiscal year, the total number of immigrant visas that are \n     made available to natives of the country of the aliens' birth \n     under section 202(e) or 203(a) of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1152(e), 1153(a)), as applicable.\n\n                                    Fresno Pacific University,\n\n                                                       Fresno, CA.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Senator Feinstein: I am writing to ask you to continue your \n     support for the Arreola family of Porterville, CA. and to ask \n     you to reintroduce a private bill to grant the family \n     permanent residency. It is laudable that you came to this \n     families aid in May 2003 because of grievous errors committed \n     by their former immigration attorney. You recognized the \n     outstanding academic achievements of Nayely, Esidronio and \n     Maria Arreola's oldest daughter, as one of the most \n     compelling reasons to allow the family to remain in the \n     United States. You recognized that the ``Arreola family had \n     and continues to embrace the American dream and that their \n     continued presence in our country would enhance the values \n     that we as Americans hold dear.'' Unfortunately the private \n     bill you introduced was not passed into law and the family is \n     in need of your support again.\n       You were right about Nayely!!! Nayely Arreola, the oldest \n     daughter, has continued in her outstanding academic \n     achievements and community service. The leaders at Fresno \n     Pacific University saw in Nayely, a young person who will \n     become exemplary of all that is good in the American dream. \n     She has heart in the face of tough times, desire leading to \n     solid community service, and leadership that our country \n     desperately needs. Nayely has become a role model of success \n     and hope that is so important to many young Hispanic students \n     in Central California. She works in the admission office and \n     often speaks to young people about the importance of a \n     college education. Fresno Pacific was so impressed with her \n     high school achievements that we offered her a full tuition \n     scholarship package to attend our fully accredited and \n     regionally ranked university.\n       Nayely's sister Cindy, now 16, is following Nayely's \n     example. So are Roberto, now 13, Daniel, now 9, and Saray, \n     now 8 years old. Nayely's parents, Esidronio Arreola-Saucedo \n     and Maria Elena Cobian Arreola are continuing to be positive \n     role models to their children and no burden on our American \n     way of life. They would have been eligible for permanent \n     residence through the Seasonal Agricultural Workers (SAW) \n     program except for poor advice from their attorney who \n     government officials have since disbarred. Please reintroduce \n     a private bill seeking to grant this Porterville Family \n     permanent resident status. All of us at Fresno Pacific \n     University who have come to know and love this family would \n     be in your debt as you to continue your support of the \n     Arreola family.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Cary W. Templeton,\n     Associate Dean of Enrollment Services.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                    Granite Hills High School,\n\n                                Porterville, CA, January 14, 2005.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: This letter is in support of \n     Granite Hills High School graduate Nayely Arreola whom I have \n     had the pleasure of knowing for the past four and one-half \n     years. Nayely is a responsible, hard working and intelligent \n     young lady.\n       Nayely was born in Mexico; English is her second language. \n     She came to the United States when she was approximately five \n     years old. When Nayely enrolled in high school at Granite \n     Hills High School she was enrolled in our AVID program. AVID, \n     ``Advancement via Individual Determination'', is a program \n     for students who have the ability and desire to go to college \n     but no one in their family has attended college.\n       Nayely took our AVID program and Granite Hills High School \n     by storm. What a successful four year high school career she \n     had. Throughout high school she was still listed as an \n     ``English Language Learner''. Nayely successfully overcame \n     not only a language barrier but many other obstacles and \n     emerged as a respected scholar.\n       Nayely graduated from Granite Hills High School with \n     honors, was a speaker at our graduation ceremony, and was and \n     is highly regarded and respected by her peers and our \n     teachers. Upon graduation, she earned The Good Samaratin \n     Scholarship a ``full ride'' scholarship to Fresno Pacific \n     University where she will excel as she did here I am sure. \n     She will be successful in any career she pursues. Her parents \n     did an excellent job: I wish I had done as well with my \n     children.\n       Cindy Arreola, Nayely's younger sister, is currently a \n     student at Granite Hills High School.\n       We need more families like the Arreolas in our country. \n     Thank you for supporting them in the past and I fervently \n     hope and pray the family will be allowed to remain in the \n     United States.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                 Veryl Ann Duncan,\n     Principal.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                    Granite Hills High School,\n\n                                                  Porterville, CA.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: I am writing you this letter on \n     behalf of Nayely Arreola and her family. It is with a \n     grateful heart that I praise you for all you have done so far \n     for this family. I am urging that the Arreola bill be \n     reintroduced so that this great family can stay in our \n     country.\n       While Nayely was at Granite Hills High School, she was my \n     prized pupil. I am the Speech and Debate teacher and Nayely \n     represented our school in the Optimist Speech contest and the \n     Lions Club Speech contest. In the Optimist contest she was a \n     Club and Zone winner and last year in the Lions Club contest \n     she was a club winner. Nayely was not only had my respect as \n     a speaker and a student in my program, she had my highest \n     opinion as the person she represented to her peers and \n     teachers. I can honestly say Nayely was the hardest working \n     student I have encountered in my tenure at Granite Hills \n     High. She graduated fourth in her class and was a C. S. F. \n     seal bearer at graduation. She was the president of the Key \n     Club where she assisted in food, coat and toy drives for the \n     needy of our community. She was a LINK, leader, which works \n     with freshmen and their orientation to our school.\n       Nayely Arreola is more than a remarkable student, she is a \n     remarkable person. Everything she has done has been to \n     prepare her to go to a University in the United States. She \n     was accepted at Fresno Pacific University as a President's \n     Scholar. She is doing an outstanding job at Fresno Pacific \n     University as a freshman. She is America's dream-her \n     contribution to our country will be great. I have watched \n     with great pride as she has grown into a wonderful young \n     lady, ready to take on the world.\n       Please, I urge you to reintroduce this bill and work to \n     have it passed.\n                                               Christine L. Amann,\n                            Reading Specialist/Speech Coordinator.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE (for himself, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Allen, Mr. Hagel, Mr. \n        Coleman, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Obama, and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 121. A bill to amend titles 10 and 38, United States Code, to \nimprove the benefits provided for survivors of deceased members of the \nArmed Forces, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Armed \nServices.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the many families of \nour Nation's servicemen and women. We owe them a tremendous debt of \ngratitude for the services they have performed in supporting their \nfamily members in uniform. These families embody courage, patriotism, \nand dedication.\n  Mr. President, we have all heard the saying, ``if the military wanted \nyou to have a family, they would have issued you one at boot camp.'' \nBut, the truth today is that more than 50% of America's men and women \nin uniform are married and about 50% of those families also have \nchildren. These families supply endless support for our servicemen and \nwomen in life and I believe we need to provide them that same support \nin the event of the death of the service member while serving on active \nduty. That is why I am joining my colleagues Senators Durbin, Allen, \nHagel, Coleman, Johnson, Obama, and Leahy in introducing legislation \ntoday\n\n[[Page S311]]\n\nto improve critical survivor benefits for those families who have lost \na loved one on active duty.\n  Our legislation would amend four key benefit programs to improve the \noverall quality of life for survivors and dependent children. First, it \nwould increase the death gratuity to $100,000 and create a death \ngratuity for each child under the age of 18 in the amount of $25,000. \nCurrently, the gratuity for spouses is just $12,000, while no benefit \nexits for dependent children. This change would provide flexibility for \nthe spouse in maintaining a home, paying off remaining debt, and \nproviding immediate funds to transition the family to a life without \nthe service member. Additionally, the dependent benefit would offer \nsurviving children an initial investment that can be used to transition \nto adulthood, for example, as a down payment on a house or for college \ntuition.\n  Second, our legislation would extend military health insurance, known \nas TRICARE Prime, to every dependent child of a deceased service member \nat no cost until the age of 21, or until 23 if the dependent attends \ncollege. The Department of Defense indicates that this important \nbenefit would save dependents approximately $15,000 per year compared \nto the cost of private health insurance premiums. Expanded TRICARE \ncoverage also guarantees that surviving dependents would continue to \nhave access to some of the best doctors this country has to offer and \nwould receive adequate health care and treatment.\n  Third, our legislation would increase the dependency and indemnity \ncompensation, or DIC, for a spouse to $1500 per month, as well as $750 \nper month for each child. In July 2004, the Government Accountability \nOffice released a report titled ``Military Personnel: Survivor Benefits \nfor Service members and Federal, State, and City Employees.'' This \nreport outlined hypothetical situations to demonstrate the benefits \nreceived at certain pay grades. This report indicated that an E-3, \nmeaning a Private First Class or a Lance Corporal, with two dependents \nand three years of service would receive $1,182 per month from the \nSurvivor Benefit Plan, SBP, and $1208 per month for DIC. This equals \n$28,680 per year for the family to live on if the surviving spouse is \nnot employed.\n  In 2003, the USDA Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion released \na report on the costs associated with raising children. The study \nindicated that, on average across the United States, families spent \nbetween $9,500 and $10,500 per child on expenses in a two child, \nhusband-wife family. Further, this study indicated that families with a \nhousehold income below $47,000 per year were only able to spend from \n$7000 to $8000 per year on expenses to raise a child. For the \nhypothetical family I just described, it would cost more than $18,000 \nper year just to meet the expenses of raising the two dependents. \nHowever, since the household income, if the surviving spouse is not \nemployed, would reach just $28,860, then it is likely that only about \n$14,000 will be spent for that purpose. Clearly, that's just not \nenough. Our bill would help ensure that the essential needs of the \nfamily can be met.\n  Finally, our legislation would increase the benefits available from \nthe Survivors' and Dependents' Educational Assistance Program. It would \neliminate the current 45 month cap on benefit payments and establish an \n$80,000 lump sum that can be drawn down for any educational expenses, \nincluding tuition, fees, room, board, and books. Under current law, a \nsurvivor only has access to about $38,867 if he/she attends college or \na trade school on a full-time basis. As we know, this amount would not \neven guarantee a survivor access to a college degree from a state \nuniversity. In fact, let's use the Ohio State University as an example. \nThis public institution will cost in-state students roughly $18,600 for \nthe 2004-2005 school year. Now, if there were no cost increases over \nthe course of a four year matriculation, which, in this day and age, is \nan unrealistic assumption, a degree from OSU would cost $75,600. That \nis $36,733 more than the current benefit available from the Department \nof Veterans Affairs. Clearly a gap exists.\n  Mr. President, we owe the families of those who have lost loved ones \nin active duty our gratitude and support. The President's inauguration \nlast week reminded me of something President Abraham Lincoln said in \nhis second inaugural address. He said this: ``With malice toward none, \nwith charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see \nthe right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up \nthe nation's wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle \nand for his widow and his orphan. . . .'' It is time to do a better job \nof caring for these families. It is time to ensure that this Congress \ndoes what is right. I ask my colleagues to stand with me in support for \nthese families and do our part, as they have done theirs.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 121\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to abolish the death penalty under Federal law; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I introduce the Federal Death \nPenalty Abolition Act of 2005. This bill would abolish the death \npenalty at the Federal level. It would put an immediate halt to \nexecutions and forbid the imposition of the death penalty as a sentence \nfor violations of Federal law.\n  Since 1976, when the death penalty was reinstated by the Supreme \nCourt, there have been almost 1,000 executions across the country, \nincluding three at the Federal level. At the same time, over 100 people \non death row were later found innocent and released from death row. \nExonerated inmates are not only removed from death row, but they are \nusually released from prison altogether. Apparently, these people never \nshould have been convicted in the first place. While death penalty \nproponents claim that the death penalty is fair, efficient, and a \ndeterrent, the fact remains that our criminal justice system has failed \nand has resulted in at least 117 very grave mistakes.\n  Nine hundred and forty-four executions, and 117 exonerations in the \nmodern death penalty era. That is an embarrassing statistic, one that \nshould have us all questioning the use of capital punishment in this \ncountry. And we continue to learn about more cases in which our justice \nsystem has failed. Since I first introduced this bill in November of \n1999, 36 death row inmates have been exonerated throughout the country, \n12 since I introduced this bill in the last Congress in February 2003. \nSince I last introduced this bill, 115 people have been executed \nnationwide. How many innocents are among them? We may never know.\n  While executions continue and the death row population grows, the \nnational debate on the death penalty intensifies and has become even \nmore vigorous. The number of voices joining in to express doubt about \nthe use of capital punishment in America is growing. As evidence of the \nflaws in our system mounts, it has created an awareness that has not \nescaped the attention of the American people. Layer after layer of \nconfidence in the death penalty system has been gradually peeling away, \nand the voices of those questioning its fairness are growing louder and \nlouder. Now they can be heard from college campuses and courtrooms and \npodiums across the Nation, to the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing \nroom, to the Supreme Court. We must not ignore them.\n  That our modern society relies on killing as punishment is disturbing \nenough. Even more disturbing, however, is that our States' and Federal \nGovernment's use of the death penalty is often not consistent with \nprinciples of due process, fairness, and justice. These principles are \nthe foundation of our criminal justice system. It is clearer than ever \nbefore that we have put innocent people on death row. In addition, \nstatistics show that those States that have the death penalty are more \nlikely to put people to death for killing white victims than for \nkilling black victims.\n  After the death penalty was reinstated by the Supreme Court in 1976, \nthe Federal Government first resumed death penalty prosecutions after \nenactment of a 1988 Federal law that provided for the death penalty for \nmurder in the course of a drug-kingpin conspiracy. The Federal death \npenalty was then expanded significantly in 1994, when the omnibus crime \nbill allowed its use to apply to a total of some 60 Federal offenses. \nSince 1994, Federal prosecutions seeking the death penalty have now \naccelerated.\n  A survey on the Federal death penalty system from 1988 to early 2000 \nwas released by the U.S. Department of Justice in September 2000. That \nreport showed troubling racial and geographic disparities in the \nFederal Government's administration of the death penalty. In other \nwords, who lives and who dies in the Federal system appears to relate \nto the color of the defendant's skin or the region of the country where \nthe defendant is prosecuted. Attorney General Janet Reno was so \ndisturbed by the results of that report that she ordered a further, in-\ndepth study of the results. Attorney General John Ashcroft pledged to \ncontinue that study, but we still await the results of that further \nstudy. The Federal Government must do all that it can to ensure that no \nperson is ever subject to harsher penalties because of the color of the \ndefendant's skin.\n  I am certain that not one of my colleagues here in the Senate, not a \nsingle one, would defend racial discrimination in this ultimate \npunishment. The most fundamental guarantee of our Constitution is equal \njustice under law, and equal protection of the laws. Yet we have a \nsystem in place today that raises grave questions about whether that \nguarantee is being met.\n  While the Federal death penalty system is clearly plagued by flaws, \nthere are 38 States across our Nation that also authorize the use of \ncapital punishment. And like the Federal system, those systems are not \nfree from error.\n  Five years ago, Governor George Ryan took the historic step of \nplacing a moratorium on executions in Illinois and creating an \nindependent, blue ribbon commission to review the State's death penalty \nsystem. The Commission conducted an extensive study of the death \npenalty in Illinois and released a report with 85 recommendations for \nreform of the death penalty system. The Commission concluded that the \ndeath penalty system is not fair, and that the risk of executing the \ninnocent is alarmingly real. Governor Ryan later pardoned four death \nrow inmates and commuted the sentences of all remaining Illinois death \nrow inmates to life in prison before he left office in January 2003:\n\n  Illinois is not alone. Four years ago, then Governor Parris \nGlendening learned of suspected racial disparities in the \nadministration of the death penalty in Maryland. Governor Glendening \ndid not look the other way. He commissioned the University of Maryland \nto conduct the most exhaustive study of Maryland's application of the \ndeath penalty in history. Then faced with the rapid approach of a \nscheduled execution, Governor Glendening acknowledged that it was \nunacceptable to allow executions to take place while the study he had \nordered was not yet complete. So, in May 2002, he placed a moratorium \non executions. Unfortunately, Governor Bob Ehrlich later lifted that \nmoratorium and executions have resumed in Maryland.\n  The Maryland study was released in January 2003, and the findings \nshould startle us all. The study found that blacks accused of killing \nwhites are\n\n[[Page S314]]\n\nsimply more likely to receive a death sentence than blacks who kill \nblacks, or than white killers. According to the report, black offenders \nwho kill whites are four times as likely to be sentenced to death as \nblacks who kill blacks, and twice as likely to get a death sentence as \nwhites who kill whites.\n  Maryland and Illinois are not exceptions to a rule, nor anomalies in \nan otherwise perfect system. In fact, since reinstatement of the modern \ndeath penalty, 81 percent of capital cases across the country have \ninvolved white victims, even though only 50 percent of murder victims \nare white. Nationwide, more than half of the death row inmates are \nAfrican Americans or Hispanic Americans.\n  There is evidence of racial disparities, inadequate counsel, \nprosecutorial misconduct, and false scientific evidence in death \npenalty systems across the country. While the research done in Maryland \nand Illinois has yielded shocking results, there are 36 other States \nthat authorize the use of the death penalty, most of them far more \nfrequently. Twenty of the 38 States that authorize capital punishment \nhave executed more inmates than Maryland, and 14 of those States have \ncarried out more executions than Illinois. So while we are closer to \nuncovering the unthinkable truth about the flaws in the Maryland and \nIllinois death penalty systems, there are 36 other States with systems \nthat are most likely plagued with the same flaws. And yet, the killing \ncontinues.\n  At the beginning of 2005, I cannot help but believe that our progress \nhas been tarnished by our Nation's not only continuing, but increasing \nuse of the death penalty. We are a Nation that prides itself on the \nfundamental principles of justice, liberty, equality and due process. \nWe are a Nation that scrutinizes the human rights records of other \nnations. Historically, we are one of the first nations to speak out \nagainst torture and killings by foreign governments. We should hold our \nown system of justice to the highest standard.\n  Over the last few years, some prominent voices in our country have \ndone just that. And they are not just voices of liberals, or of the \nfaith community. They are the voices of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, \nReverend Pat Robertson, George Will, former FBI Director William \nSessions, Republican Governor George Ryan, and Democratic Governor \nParris Glendening. The voices of those questioning our application of \nthe death penalty are growing in number, and they are growing louder.\n  And while we examine the flaws in our death penalty system, we cannot \nhelp but note that our use of the death penalty stands in stark \ncontrast to the majority of nations, which have abolished the death \npenalty in law or practice. There are now 117 countries that have \nabolished the death penalty in law or in practice. The European Union \ndenies membership in the alliance to those nations that use the death \npenalty. In fact, it passed a resolution calling for the immediate and \nunconditional global abolition of the death penalty, and it \nspecifically called on all States within the United States to abolish \nthe death penalty. This is significant because it reflects the \nunanimous view of a group of nations with which the United States \nenjoys the closest of relationships and shares the deepest common \nvalues.\n  What is even more troubling in the international context is that the \nUnited States is now one of only five countries that imposes the death \npenalty for crimes committed by juveniles. So, while a May 2002 Gallup \npoll found that 69 percent of Americans oppose the death penalty for \nthose under the age of 18, we are one of only five nations on this \nearth that puts to death people who were under 18 years of age when \nthey committed their crimes. The others are Iran, the Democratic \nRepublic of the Congo, Nigeria, and Saudi Arabia. In the last decade, \nthe United States has executed more juvenile offenders than all other \nnations combined.\n  These are countries that we often criticize for human rights abuses. \nWe should remove any basis for charges that human rights violations are \ntaking place on our own soil by halting the execution of people who \nwere not even adults when they committed the crimes for which they were \nsentenced to die. No one can reasonably argue that executing child \noffenders is a normal or acceptable practice in the world community. \nAnd I do not think that we should be proud that the United States is \nthe world leader in the execution of child offenders.\n  As we begin a new year and another Congress, our society is still far \nfrom fully just. The continued use of the death penalty shames us. The \npenalty is at odds with our best traditions. It is wrong and it is \nimmoral. The adage ``two wrongs do not make a right,'' applies here in \nthe most fundamental way. Our Nation has long ago done away with other \nbarbaric punishments like whipping and cutting off the ears of \ncriminals. Just as our Nation did away with these punishments as \ncontrary to our humanity and ideals, it is time to abolish the death \npenalty as we seek justice in this new century. And it is not just a \nmatter of morality. The continued viability of our justice system as a \ntruly just system that deserves the respect of our own people and the \nworld requires that we do so. Our Nation's striving to remain the \nleading defender of freedom, liberty and equality demands that we do \nso.\n  Abolishing the death penalty will not be an easy task. It will take \npatience, persistence, and courage. As we work to move forward in a \nrapidly changing world, let us leave this archaic practice behind.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in taking the first step in abolishing \nthe death penalty in our great Nation. I also call on each State that \nauthorizes the use of the death penalty to cease this practice. Let us \nstep away from the culture of violence and restore fairness and \nintegrity to our criminal justice system.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 122\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend part D of title XVIII of the Social Security \nAct to provide for negotiation of fair prices for Medicare prescription \ndrugs; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill that will \nfix one of the fundamental flaws of the Medicare prescription drug \nbenefit signed into law last Congress. The ``Efficiency in Government \nHealth Care Spending Act'' will remove language included in the \nMedicare Modernization Act that prohibits the Medicare program from \nnegotiating prescription drug prices with manufacturers. I believe that \nthe Medicare prescription drug benefit does far too little to bring \ndown the prices of prescription drugs, and that there are not enough \nmeasures to keep the skyrocketing cost of the program in check. In \nfact, it actually takes away one of the best tools the Medicare program \ncould use in bringing down prescription drug prices by denying the \ngovernment the ability to negotiate price discounts on behalf of \nMedicare beneficiaries.\n  My bill will allow the Federal Government to take advantage of the \npurchasing power of the Medicare program, saving taxpayers' dollars \nwhile reducing the costs of prescription drugs for Medicare \nbeneficiaries. We need to act now to fix the flaws included in the \nMedicare prescription drug benefit, before the benefit begins next \nyear.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 123\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Prohibiting the Federal Government from negotiating \n     prescription drug prices with manufacturers fails to take \n     advantage of the purchasing power of the Medicare program.\n       (2) Negotiating prescription drug prices can reduce the \n     costs of prescription drugs for both the Medicare program and \n     taxpayers.\n       (3) A 2002 study by the inspector general of the Department \n     of Health and Human Services found that--\n       (A) both the Medicare program and the beneficiaries of the \n     Medicare program continually pay too much for medical \n     equipment and medical supplies; and\n       (B) if the Medicare program paid the same prices for 16 \n     health care supplies as the Department of Veterans Affairs, \n     which directly negotiates prices with manufacturers, pays for \n     those supplies, the Federal Government could save \n     $958,000,000 each year.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nrepeal the MA Regional Plan Stabilization Fund; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill that will \nremove the multi-billion dollar ``stabilization fund'' from the new \nMedicare prescription drug benefit. This stabilization fund is in \nessence a slush fund that gives billions of dollars to private \ninsurance companies. This is not an efficient use of taxpayers' \ndollars. In fact, it's not clear why it's even necessary. If private \nmanaged care plans are successful in bringing costs down, as backers of \nthe new Medicare bill expect, and if seniors supposedly want to choose \nprivate plans, as backers of the new Medicare bill believe, then why \nshould American taxpayers pay private companies more money to get more \npeople to enroll in them?\n  We should not be subsidizing private health insurance companies in \nthe name of Medicare reform. It is fiscally irresponsible, in a time of \nrecord deficits, to use taxpayers' dollars as a giveaway to private \ninsurance companies. By removing this multi-billion slush fund, my bill \nwill save the American taxpayers $10 billion. Many analysts, including \nthe Administration's analysts, predict that the new Medicare \nprescription drug benefit will far surpass the $400 billion budgeted \nfor it. We need to look carefully at how we spend Medicare dollars, so \nthat we can ensure that the program remains solvent for future \ngenerations.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 124\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to designate the United States courthouse located at \n501 I Street in Sacramento, California, as the ``Robert T. Matsui \nUnited States Courthouse''; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today to name \nthe courthouse in Sacramento, California, as the ``Robert T. Matsui \nUnited States Courthouse.'' I am pleased to be joined in this effort by \nSenators Feinstein and Durbin.\n  Congressman Matsui's death on January 1, 2005 was shocking to all of \nus. Naming the Federal Courthouse in Sacramento in his honor would be a \nvery appropriate memorial to his continual efforts toward a just and \nfair society.\n  After his childhood internment, Bob Matsui could have chosen to dwell \non the sadness of his early years. Instead, he chose to give his life \nto public service, working to improve the lives of those in his \ncongressional district and all Americans. He was a true patriot.\n  He was first elected to Congress in 1978, and spent the past 26 years \nrepresenting the citizens of Sacramento with distinction and pride. He \nserved as a senior member of the Committee on Ways and Means, and took \na particular interest in complex public policy issues including tax, \ninternational trade, social security, healthcare, and welfare reform.\n  Congressman Matsui's dedication to the well-being of America's \nchildren earned him the Congressional Advocate of the Year award from \nThe Child Welfare League of America in 1992 and 1994. The Congressman \nwas also honored with the Anti Defamation League's Lifetime Achievement \nAward for his commitment to human rights.\n  Included in Congressman Matsui's long list of legislative \nachievements were his accomplishments to benefit the people of his \ndistrict including flood control, transportation, and his success in \nobtaining $142 million in federal funding for the courthouse in \nSacramento.\n  A graduate of the University of California at Berkeley and Hastings \nCollege of Law, he founded his own law practice in 1967, and was \nelected to the Sacramento City Council in 1971. After winning \nreelection in 1975 he became vice mayor of Sacramento in 1977. \nCongressman Matsui is survived by his wife, Doris Matsui, their son \nBrian and his wife Amy, and granddaughter, Anna.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INOUYE:\n  S. 127. A bill to amend chapter 81 of title 5, United States Code, to \nauthorize the use of clinical social workers to conduct evaluations to \ndetermine work-related emotional and mental illnesses; to the Committee \non Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I introduce the Clinical Social \nWorkers' Recognition Act to correct a continuing problem in the Federal \nEmployees Compensation Act. This bill will also provide clinical social \nworkers the recognition they deserve as independent providers of \nquality mental health care services.\n  Clinical social workers are authorized to independently diagnose and \ntreat mental illnesses through public and private health insurance \nplans across the nation. However, Title V of the United States Code, \ndoes not permit the use of mental health evaluations conducted by \nclinical social workers for use as evidence in determining workers' \ncompensation claims brought by federal employees. The bill I am \nintroducing corrects this problem.\n  It is a sad irony that Federal employees may select a clinical social \nworker through their health plans to provide mental health services, \nbut may not go to this same professional for workers' compensation \nevaluations. The failure to recognize the validity of evaluations \nprovided by clinical social workers unnecessarily limits federal \nemployees' selection of a provider to conduct the workers' compensation \nmental health evaluations. Lack of this recognition may well impose an \nundue burden on federal employees where clinical social workers are the \nonly available providers of mental health care.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 127\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to designate certain public land in Humboldt, Del \nNorte, Mendocino, Lake, and Napa Counties in the State of California as \nwilderness, to designate certain segments of the Black Butte River in \nMendocino County, California as a wild or scenic river, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am introducing a bill today that will \nprotect hundreds of thousands of acres of wilderness in Northern \nCalifornia. The Northern California Coastal Wild Heritage Wilderness \nAct would designate over 300,000 acres in 14 areas as wilderness and \nwould protect 21 miles of the Black Butte Creek as wild and scenic. The \nSenate passed this legislation during the 108th Congress, and I am \nhopeful this year that the bill will become law.\n  California's natural treasures have always been one of the things \nthat make California unique, drawing millions of people to them over \nthe years to revel in their wild beauty. But that beauty must not be \ntaken for granted. It is important that we move now to designate these \nspecial places in California as wilderness to protect them for the \nenjoyment of future generations.\n  That is why I introduced the statewide California Wild Heritage Act \nduring the 107th Congress and the 108th Congress, and I will soon be \nreintroducing it. The California Wild Heritage Act would protect more \nthan 2.5 million acres of public land throughout the state of \nCalifornia, as well as the free-flowing portions of 23 rivers. Every \nacre of wild land is a treasure, but the areas protected in this bill \nare some of California's most precious.\n  I am pleased to join Representative Mike Thompson of California in \nintroducing this legislation, which protect those portions of my \nstatewide bill that are located in California's First Congressional \nDistrict. The areas protected under this legislation are some of the \nmost magnificent wild places in our state. For example, in southwestern \nHumboldt and northwestern Mendocino counties, over 42,000 acres of the \nKing Range will be protected as wilderness. This is the wildest portion \nof the California coast, boasting the longest stretch of undeveloped \ncoastline in the United States outside of Alaska.\n  This bill will protect watersheds that provide clean water to our \ncities and farms. This bill would also protect the precious plant and \nanimal species that make their homes in these areas. Endangered and \nthreatened species whose habitats will be protected by this bill \ninclude the bald eagle, California brown pelican, steelhead trout, coho \nsalmon, bald eagle, peregrine falcon, northern spotted owl, and \nRoosevelt elk.\n  During the last 20 years, 675,000 acres of unprotected wilderness \nlost their wilderness character due to activities such as logging and \nmining. As our population increases, and California becomes home to \nalmost 50 million people by the middle of the century, development \npressures threaten our remaining wild places. We must protect our \nprecious wild lands and wild rivers before they are lost forever.\n  Mr. President, those of us who live in the United States have a very \nspecial responsibility to protect our natural heritage. With this \nlegislation, we are one step closer to protecting this legacy for our \nchildren's children, and their children.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. TALENT:\n  S. 129. A bill to amend title 23, United States Code, to provide for \nHOV facilities; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I am pleased to be introducing this bill, \nwhich will allow more owners of hybrid electric vehicles, or HEVs, to \nhave access to HOV lanes on Federal highways. For all of us who have a \ndesire to lessen our dependence on foreign oil and encourage the use of \nrenewable energy, this bill represents a step forward towards achieving \nthose goals.\n  The language that is currently in the highway bills passed by the \nHouse and the Senate allows hybrid vehicles that achieve a 45 mile-per-\ngallon fuel economy highway rating to use HOV lanes. Any hybrid that \nachieves that kind of fuel economy certainly deserves to get that \nstatus, because it is a very impressive fuel economy rating and \nrepresents a substantial improvement over non-hybrid vehicles. What the \n45 mile-per-gallon standard fails to take into account, however, is \nthat many larger hybrid vehicles achieve a much larger fuel economy \nimprovement over their internal combustion engine counterparts, and \nthus save more energy, than smaller vehicles which manage to meet the \nstandard but are a less drastic improvement over their non-hybrid \ncounterparts.\n  To illustrate this, take the 2005 model Honda Civic HEV, which gets \njust over 45 miles-per-gallon. This represents less than a 40 percent \nimprovement over the comparable internal combustion model. The 2005 \nFord Escape HEV, on the other hand, is a truck, so it gets fewer miles \nper gallon than a Civic, between 35 and 40. However, this is a 75 \npercent improvement over its internal combustion engine counterpart, \nand in addition, the Escape HEV emits 3-4 tons fewer greenhouse gases \nevery year than the non-hybrid.\n  There is no reason to discriminate against these larger, American-\nmade hybrids like the Ford Escape. They are truly engineering marvels \nand are so clearly beneficial for the environment. The bill that I have \nsponsored will give States the discretion to open up their HOV lanes to \nhybrid vehicles that achieve a substantial increase in fuel economy \nrelative to comparable gasoline vehicles, or achieve a substantial \nincrease in lifetime fuel savings relative to comparable gasoline \nvehicles. It creates a minimum standard of improvement necessary for \nhybrids, but gives States the option of increasing the requirements. \nThis bill also allows States to open HOV lanes to single occupancy \nadvanced lean burn vehicles that achieve at least a 25 percent increase \nin fuel economy relative to comparable gasoline vehicles and that are \ncertified to Clean Air Act Tier 2 standards.\n  I am hopeful that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle can agree \nthat we should do all we can to encourage the use of renewable energy \nin our country, and hybrid vehicles are an important part of that. The \npeople who drive these vehicles are doing their part to help clean up \nthe air and increase energy conservation, and we should give more \npeople an incentive to buy these vehicles by giving them access to HOV \nlanes.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 129\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \ndeduction for premiums on mortgage insurance; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, today, I am reintroducing important \nlegislation to help more Americans realize the dream of homeownership. \nThe Mortgage Insurance Fairness Act would make mortgage insurance \npayment premiums tax deductible. In doing so, it will help more lower-\nincome Americans purchase homes for their families.\n  It is widely recognized that homeownership helps to create stable and \nsafe communities. As such, the Federal Government has long sought to \nincrease homeownership. President Bush has announced a goal of 5.5 \nmillion new homeowners by the year 2010. Achieving that goal requires \nhelping those that have typically had difficulty purchasing homes--\nyoung people, low-income families, members of minority groups.\n  Government and private mortgage insurance programs help first-time, \nlow-income and veteran borrowers afford to purchase homes. The Veterans \nAffairs (VA), Federal Housing Authority (FHA), Regional Housing \nAuthority (RHA) and Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI) programs allow \nbuyers to make a down payment of 3 percent or less of the appraised \nvalue. For many lower- and middle-income families, mortgage insurance \nmakes it possible for them to buy their first home.\n  In Oregon, more than 137,000 families held mortgages with either FHA \nor private mortgage insurance in 2002. In 2001, 62 percent of the \ninsured home purchases in Oregon were low-income borrowers, and insured \nmortgages covered 25 percent of all home purchase loans that year.\n  Nationwide, mortgage insurance covers over half of home loans made to \nAfrican American and Hispanic borrowers. Similarly, over half of the \nloans to borrowers with incomes below the median income were covered by \nmortgage insurance. The people who use mortgage insurance are regular \nworking families who live in every community throughout the country. In \nall, more than twelve million American families pay mortgage insurance.\n  Currently, these borrowers are not allowed to deduct the cost of \ntheir mortgage insurance from their Federal taxes. If these payments \nwere made deductible, the cost of homeownership would go down and more \nfamilies would be able to buy homes. It is estimated that the Mortgage \nInsurance Fairness Act would increase the number of homeowners by \n300,000 per year.\n  Extending tax deductions to mortgage insurance will help to make the \ndream of owning a home attainable for more Americans. We came very \nclose to enacting this legislation last year when it was included in \nthe Senate version of the JOBS Act. Unfortunately, in the end we were \nnot able to complete action on this bill. I look forward to again \nworking with my colleagues to see this legislation is passed and signed \ninto law. I thank you for the opportunity to speak today, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support this important bi-partisan legislation. I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of this legislation be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 132\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to adjust the boundary of Redwood National Park in the \nState of California; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation \ncosponsored by Senator Boxer to adjust the boundary of Redwood National \nPark in the State of California to include the addition of the Mill \nCreek property. This continues the effort initiated in the last \nCongress with the leadership of Congressman Mike Thompson, to solidify \nand expand the co-operative management relationship between the United \nStates Government and the State of California, working together to \nprotect forever the ancient majesty of the redwood forest.\n  In 2002, the California Department of Parks and Recreation acquired \nfrom the Save-the-Redwoods League 25,000 acres of forest land known as \nthe Mill Creek property in Del Norte County, which is contiguous with \nthe Redwood National and State parks boundary. This bill would include \nwithin the park boundary the Mill Creek acquisition and about 900 acres \nof land acquired and added to the State redwood parks since the 1978 \nexpansion of the Redwood National Park boundary. There would be no \nFederal costs for land acquisition or development resulting from this \nlegislation.\n  Approval of the expansion of the boundary of Redwood National Park to \ninclude the headwaters of Mill Creek will complete the vision of the \nRedwood Park embraced by Senator Kuchel in S.1370 that he introduced in \n1967, a vision dating back to the McLaughlin-Cook report issued by the \nNational Park Service in 1937. Protection of the headwaters of Mill \nCreek will secure the long term viability of the ancient redwoods \nalready within Redwood National and State Park. It would permanently \nsafeguard the coho salmon who return to spawn in the clear, cold waters \nof this forest.\n  These lands will be managed by the same cooperative management \nagreement between the National Park Service and the California \nDepartment of Parks and Recreation. This partnership is viewed as a \nmodel of interagency cooperative management efforts and will provide \nfor more efficient and costeffective management of an ecologically \nsignificant resource.\n  This bill enjoys strong support from local and Federal officials, \nincluding Del Norte County and the Department of the Interior. Given \nthis support and lack of controversy, I believe this legislation to be \nof great importance to ensure that our Redwood National Park is further \nprotected.\n  I have long held a deep interest in protecting California's \nmagnificent Redwoods. The coast redwood, the sequoia sempervirens, is \nnative only to the West Coast where it stands in a narrow band from the \ntip of the Big Sur Coast to the Chetco River, just north of the \nCalifornia-Oregon border. The redwood stands taller than any other tree \nin the world and traces its lineage to among the oldest of living \nthings. The cathedrals formed by these ancient trees inspire the best \nin us as a people. The redwood forests of California are a national and \nworldwide treasure that is ours to protect and preserve.\n  In 1966, the Headwaters Agreement was negotiated in part in my \noffices to protect approximately 7,500 acres of old growth redwoods, \nwhich was the largest grove of redwoods held in private ownership at \nthe time. It is my great pleasure today to introduce this legislation \nto extend our national commitment to collaboration in preservation of \nthe redwoods and the watersheds they anchor.\n  I applaud Congressman Mike Thompson's commitment to this issue and \nurge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 134\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

REDWOOD NATIONAL PARK BOUNDARY ADJUSTMENT.\n\n       Section 2(a) of the Act of Public Law 90-545 (16 U.S.C. \n     79b(a)) is amended--\n       (1) in the first sentence, by striking ``(a) The area'' and \n     all that follows through the period at the end and inserting \n     the following: ``(a)(1) The Redwood National Park consists of \n     the land generally depicted on the map entitled `Redwood \n     National Park, Revised Boundary', numbered 167/60502, and \n     dated February, 2003.'';\n       (2) by inserting after paragraph (1) (as designated by \n     paragraph (1)) the following:\n       ``(2) The map referred to in paragraph (1) shall be--\n       ``(A) on file and available for public inspection in the \n     appropriate offices of the National Park Service; and\n       ``(B) provided by the Secretary of the Interior to the \n     appropriate officers of Del Norte and Humboldt Counties, \n     California.''; and\n       (3) in the second sentence--\n       (A) by striking ``The Secretary'' and inserting the \n     following:\n       ``(3) The Secretary;'' and\n       (B) by striking ``one hundred and six thousand acres'' and \n     inserting ``133,000 acres''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 136. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to provide \nsupplemental funding and other services that are necessary to assist \ncertain local school districts in the State of California in providing \neducation services for students attending schools located within \nYosemite National Park, to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to \nadjust the boundaries of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area; to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I rise today to introduce a bill that combines needed \nhelp for small Yosemite schools, and an addition to the beautiful \nGolden Gate National Recreation Area. Each of these bills individually \nhas passed both the House and Senate in previous Congresses.\n  The first title of this legislation provides critical funds to three \nsmall schools nestled in the heart of Yosemite National Park and \nauthorizes the Yosemite Regional Transportation System to shuttle \nvisitors in and out of the park.\n  Approximately 130 children of park service employees are taught in \nthe three elementary small schools located in Yosemite National Park--\nWawona, El Portal, and Yosemite Valley elementary schools.\n  These schools represent a dying breed of education models; they are \nsmall schools that teach children who live in remote communities and \nare taught by one or a group of teachers. At El Portal, three teachers \ninstruct 53 students in seven grades. Wawona has 17 students in 7 \ngrades who are taught by one teacher/principal.\n  And Yosemite Valley serves 60 students in 8 grades who are taught by \ntwo teachers.\n  The remote location of these schools, their small sizes and \nCalifornia's unique method for funding education, have all contributed \nto the schools amassing a combined deficit of $290,000. In their \nefforts to continue to provide basic educational services to students, \nthe schools have had to cut supplemental instruction that would \nnormally be available to students taught outside of the park.\n  Some have suggested that these schools consolidate into one to pool \ntheir limited resources. While this may seem to solve the problem, you \nmust understand that many of these students already travel many miles \non treacherous mountainous roads to attend their current schools. If \nthe three schools were to consolidate, this problem would be \nexacerbated, requiring many students to make a 2 hour commute to their \nnew schools.\n\n[[Page S350]]\n\n  I do not believe this is a viable option and that is why I support \nthis legislation.\n  Last year, Senator Bingaman, Congressman Radanovich and I worked out \na compromise on this legislation that would help the schools while \nprotecting the National Park Service's budget. The compromise includes \nthe following terms:\n  For fiscal year 2006 through 2009, the Secretary of the Interior may \nprovide up to $400,000 in funds to the Bass Lake Union Elementary \nSchool District and the Mariposa Unified School District for \neducational services to students who are dependents of persons engaged \nin the administration, operation, and maintenance of the Park or \nstudents who live at or near the Park; the Secretary can only provide \nthe funds if the State of California and local agencies maintain 2005 \nper-student funding levels to the schools, and the Secretary also must \nmake sure that the assistance to the schools does not reduce the \nremaining funding available to Yosemite National Park below fiscal year \n2005 levels.\n  Furthermore, this legislation allows the Park Service to allot \nfederal funds for the continuing operation of a bus service that \nshuttles visitors through Yosemite National Park--the Yosemite Area \nRegional Transportation System.\n  The federally funded demonstration project that allowed YARTS to \noffer services on a temporary basis expired in May 2002 and since then, \nYARTS has leveraged local funds to ensure that services were not \ndiscontinued.\n  Both the Park Service and YARTS are supportive of continuing their \nmutually beneficial agreement. This legislation would do just that by \ntaking the burden off local entities and providing the necessary \nassistance that this service needs.\n  I am also pleased to introduce today a second title in this \nlegislation to allow the National Park Service to extend the boundaries \nof the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, GGNRA, by acquiring \ncritical natural landscapes and scenic vistas.\n  This bill meets several distinct needs in California and national \nneeds of all National Park System visitors by adding 4,600 acres of \npristine natural land to the boundary of the Golden Gate Recreation \nArea. It will protect four major watersheds, preserve the home of \nnumerous threatened, rare and endangered plant and animal species in \nthe region, allow potential access to valuable future trail links to \ncontiguous State and county parks, and establish a dramatic and logical \nsouthern entrance to the park.\n  A key component of this legislation is its three-way, local-state-\nfederal partnership. Half of the total purchase price of these lands \nhas already been donated by local and State sources. Additionally, this \nlegislation specifically provides that all land transactions involve a \nwilling seller and willing buyer.\n  Furthermore, this bill has the strong support of local community \ngroups, the former Golden Gate National Recreation Area Advisory \nCommission, the San Mateo County Board of Supervisors, the National \nPark Service, and the California State Farm Bureau. It also has the \nendorsement of the San Francisco Chronicle and the San Jose Mercury \nNews. I know of no opposition to this bill.\n  Expanding the boundary of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area to \ninclude Rancho Corral de Tierra through such a beneficial partnership \nis an opportunity not to be missed. A vast land within a major \nmetropolitan area that offers extraordinary scenic views of the Pacific \ncoastline and the greater Bay Area, a place with plants found nowhere \nelse on earth find refuge, a home for rare and endangered animals, is \navailable now for protection and enjoyment. We have the chance to enjoy \nthis special land and to leave a lasting legacy for our children and \nour grandchildren.\n  California's national parks are truly invaluable and the park that \nthis bill supports offers an opportunity for visitors and residents to \nenjoy unique national habitats and offers a unique chance for the \nNational Park Service and the community to work together, not only to \nprotect the environment, but also the interests of the nearby \ncommunities and national and international visitors.\n  This bill enjoys strong support from local and State officials and I \nhope that it will have as much strong bipartisan support this Congress, \nas it did last Congress. Congressman Tom Lantos plans to introduce \ncompanion legislation for this bill in the House and I applaud his \nleadership on this issue.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 136\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Payments may not be used for construction, construction \n     contracts, or major capital improvements.\n       (c) Limitation on Amount of Funds.--Payments made under \n     this section shall not exceed the lesser of--\n       (1) $400,000 in any fiscal year; or\n       (2) the amount necessary to provide students described in \n     subsection (a) with educational services that are normally \n     provided and generally available to students who attend \n     public schools elsewhere in the State of California.\n       (d) Source of Payments.--(1) Except as otherwise provided \n     in this subsection, the Secretary may use funds available to \n     the National Park Service from appropriations, donations, or \n     fees.\n       (2) Funds from the following sources shall not be used to \n     make payments under this section:\n       (A) Any law authorizing the collection or expenditure of \n     entrance or use fees at units of the National Park System, \n     including the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965 \n     (16 U.S.C. 460l-4 et seq.); the recreational fee \n     demonstration program established under section 315 of the \n     Department of the Interior and Related Agencies \n     Appropriations Act, 1996 (16 U.S.C. 460l-6a note); and the \n     National Park Passport Program established under section 602 \n     of the National Parks Omnibus Management Act of 1998 (16 \n     U.S.C. 5992).\n       (B) Emergency appropriations for flood recovery at Yosemite \n     National Park.\n       (3)(A) The Secretary may use an authorized funding source \n     to make payments under this section only if the funding \n     available to Yosemite National Park from such source (after \n     subtracting any payments to the school districts authorized \n     under this section) is greater than or equal to the amount \n     made available to the park for the prior fiscal year, or in \n     fiscal year 2005, whichever is greater.\n       (B) It is the sense of Congress that any payments made \n     under this section should not result in a reduction of funds \n     to Yosemite National Park from any specific funding source, \n     and that with respect to appropriated funds, funding levels \n     should reflect annual increases in the park's operating base \n     funds that are generally made to units of the National Park \n     System.\n\n     SEC. 102.

A bill to amend the Small Business Act to direct the \nAdministrator of the Small Business Administration to establish a \nvocational and technical entrepreneurship development program; to the \nCommittee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, as Ranking Member of the Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship Committee, today I am introducing a package of bills \nthat will help small business owners with access to loans, business \ncounseling and Federal procurement opportunities. Each of the bills was \npreviously introduced on its own or as part of the Committee's \nextensive Small Business Administration reauthorization proposal that \npassed the Senate unanimously last Congress. These are provisions that \nare necessary for enabling our nation's small businesses to continue to \nhave the resources and tools they need to compete with larger \ncompanies. They will help America's budding entrepreneurs continue to \nseek out business opportunities and continue to start businesses. \nEnactment of this assistance will show that the Federal government is \nnot there to make the road to success more difficult for small \nbusinesses, but to help them where the private sector will not.\n  Mr. President, the first bill of this package is the Small Business \nFederal Contractor Safeguard Act. It includes essential contractor \nprotections that were a part of the Small Business Administration \nreauthorization package that passed the Senate unanimously last \nCongress but was stalled during negotiations in the House of \nRepresentatives. These much-needed protections will help level the \nplaying field for small firms and create a procurement atmosphere that \nfosters competition, fair access and equal opportunity for smaller \nentities.\n  With Federal agencies awarding larger, more complex and more costly \ncontracts, and with less staff at the Small Business Administration and \nwithin Agency contracting offices performing oversight, this nation's \nsmall businesses and its taxpayers are the ones shouldering the burden \nwhen small business goals continue to be unmet. In addition to helping \nsmall businesses obtain access to procurement opportunities, these \ngoals are meant to help the government benefit from the cost-savings \nand innovations small business contractors can often provide.\n  Significant steps were made during the last Congress to address the \nchallenges of contract bundling; however, it is my belief that passing \nand implementing binding statutory requirements is the only long-term \nsolution to the on-going problem of contract bundling, also called \ncontract consolidation. The first section of the bill creates a two-\ntiered approach to preventing unnecessary contract consolidation. \nCivilian agencies will be required to meet specific standards if they \nattempt to consolidate contracts above $2 million and additional \nrequirements for those contracts above $5 million. The Department of \nDefense is required to meet two types of similar requirements for \ncontracts above $5 million and $7 million. The bill also eliminates the \nuse of the term ``contract bundling'' and expands the definition of \n``contract consolidation,'' closing a loophole that has been widely \nused to the detriment of many small businesses.\n  In addition to increasing opportunities for prime contracts by \neliminating unnecessary contract consolidation, this bill addresses \nanother serious problem: the dishonest treatment of small business \nsubcontractors by large business prime contractors. Small businesses \nhave been severely hamstrung by the dishonest practices of some large \nbusiness prime contracts that delay paying their subcontractors, \nfalsely report their subcontracting plans and use ``bait and switch'' \ntactics.\n  This bill holds prime contractors responsible for the validity of \nsubcontracting data, requiring the CEO to certify to the accuracy of \nthe subcontracting report under penalty of law. It also makes the \npenalties for falsifying data included in subcontracting reports match \nthe current $500,000 penalty for businesses that falsify their status \nas a small and disadvantaged business. Under this bill, if one \nintentionally falsifies data as a part of a subcontracting report to a \nfederal Agency, he is defrauding the United States government and will \nbe punished to the full extent of the law.\n  Finally, the bill requires contracting officers to maintain a \ndatabase of contract performance that is made available to the small \nbusiness subcontractor upon completion of the contract. This report can \nthen be used as a record of past performance, building a history that \nwill help successful small firms bid on future Federal prime contracts \nor subcontracts. Each contracting officer will be empowered to withhold \na portion of the payment to the prime contractor until he also receives \nthe completed and accurate performance report. Any material breach of \ncontract that is found will be immediately reported to the Inspector \nGeneral of that Agency for a complete investigation.\n  The second bill of this small business legislative package is the SBA \nMicroenterprise Improvements Act. It was also included as part of the \nSmall Business Administration reauthorization package and passed by the \nSenate unanimously last Congress. I am reintroducing these provisions \nbecause they are vital to the microenterprise programs administered by \nthe SBA: the Microloan Program and the Program for Investment in \nMicroentrepreneurs (PRIME).\n  As I have stated on numerous occasions, I disagree with the \nAdministration's proposals to cut back funding for microloans and \ntraining assistance intended to encourage entrepreneurship and foster \nAmerica's smallest small businesses. And I wholeheartedly disagree with \nthe Administration's ill-\n\n[[Page S352]]\n\nfounded argument that these borrowers are being, or will be, served \nthrough the SBA's 7(a) loan guarantee program. SBA's loan programs are \nnot one-size fits all. The small borrower in the Microloan program is \ndifferent, and therefore has different needs, than the small business \nborrower being served through the 7(a) loan program. Both lending \nvehicles are important, but they are different, and one is not a \nsubstitute for the other.\n  Who are these borrowers being served through the microloan program? \nThirty percent are African American; 11 percent are Hispanic; 37 \npercent are women; and, anywhere from 30 percent to 40 percent go to \nsmall businesses in rural areas. Because of their size, the size of the \nloan they need and their relative inexperience, small businesses \nborrowers are turned away by banks, and yet the Administration proposed \ncutting the Microloan program by 36 percent in its fiscal year 2004 \nbudget, and cut all funding in its fiscal year 2005 budget. The SBA \nneeds to fully fund these programs and put more resources into the \noffice that manages the program. Four people are not enough to manage \n1,400 loans and 180 grants. To make matters worse, the SBA's long-time \nmanager of micro-enterprise programs, Jody Raskind, is leaving the \nAgency. All those who support the good work of fostering SBA's \nMicroloan program are sorry to see her go, not only because of her \ndedication and hard work, but also because they are concerned that the \nAdministration will never really fill the job, letting the \nprograms languish. I urge the Administration to move quickly to fill \nthat position, just as the private sector would, by working with the \nMicroloan community to identify someone who is competent, resourceful \nand dedicated to monitoring integrity of these programs and fostering \ntheir success.\n\n  In addition, we need to finally enact some changes to the Microloan \nprogram that have passed the Senate several times over the last four \nyears but have yet to pass the full Congress because of unrelated \npolitical fights. I urge my colleagues to let us move forward with \nmaking these provisions law, once and for all. The first part of the \nSBA Microenterprise Improvements Act includes many of the provisions \npassed as part of S. 174, a bill which Senator Snowe and I introduced \nin 2001 and the Committee and the full Senate voted to pass by \nunanimous consent in 2002. As I mentioned earlier, these provisions \nwere also included as part of S.1375, the SBA reauthorization bill that \npassed the Senate unanimously in 2003. The updates and changes to the \nMicroloan program included in this bill will improve the program in \nseveral ways.\n  First, it will allow intermediaries to make revolving-term loans or \nlonger fixed term loans to small businesses. Currently, intermediaries \nmay only make ``short-term'' loans with fixed terms, which restrict the \nability of microlenders to structure loans that meet the needs of \ncertain small enterprises. This will benefit small businesses, the \nlenders, and the SBA because it will eliminate repeated paperwork and \nunnecessary administrative burdens. It will help small businesses, such \nas carpenters, who need revolving loans to finance the jobs as they \ncome in, rather than taking multiple little, fixed-term loans. Second, \nthis bill also contains a change to the Microlenders eligibility. \nRather than tying eligibility to the expertise of the entity, this bill \nmakes it possible for new entities to qualify as the SBA microlending \nintermediaries if they have staffs who are experienced in this unique \nor specialized lending and technical assistance. This bill also \nadjusts, reflecting changes in the market, the average smaller size of \nmicroloans from $7,500 to $10,000, to make it consistent with similar \nchanges enacted in December 2000. This is important because microloan \nintermediaries that have a microloan portfolio with an average loan \nsize of not more than $10,000 will now be eligible to receive an \ninterest rate lower than the normal rate extended by the SBA to \nintermediaries. This bill also changes, from 25 percent to 30 percent, \nthe amount of technical assistance (TA) funds an intermediary can \ncontract with an outside expert and the amount of grants a lender can \nuse to counsel prospective borrowers. In addition, the legislation \nrequires the SBA to report annually on the requirement that states that \nAgency must contract out 7 percent of its loan dollars for intermediary \ntraining.\n  Last, the SBA Microenterprise Improvements Act, like S.1375, requires \nthe SBA to develop an improved subsidy rate model to determine the cost \nof microloans. The one the Agency has used since the program's \ninception does not reflect the performance of the program. For example, \nin Fiscal Year 2003, the administration's budget doubled the subsidy \nrate (which is the government's cost of the program) from 6.78 percent \nto 13.05 percent, even though the program had not experienced any loss \nof federal funds since the first loan was made in 1992. This broken \nmethod of calculating the cost of these loans is a waste of taxpayer \nmoney because Congress has to appropriate unnecessary funds to run the \nprogram. Now is the time to fix it.\n  The second part of the SBA Microenterprise Improvements Act also \ncomes from S.1375, but was not included in the small business \nreauthorization bill that passed Congress last session. It begins by \nreauthorizing the PRIME program through 2007 and transfers its \nlegislative language from the Riegle Community Development and \nRegulatory Improvement Act of 1994 to section 37 of the Small Business \nAct. Additionally, it includes a provision that Senator Bingaman and I \nworked closely to develop that will expand PRIME with a separate $2 \nmillion authorization to provide direct, in-depth technical assistance \nand counseling to disadvantaged Native American small business owners. \nThe rationale for amending the PRIME Act, rather than creating a \nseparate program, is that PRIME is currently operational and simply \nneeds additional targeted efforts and funding so it can better address \nthe needs of the Native American entrepreneurial community. The \nBingaman-Kerry approach uses an existing program structure to help find \na solution to the long-term economic handicap existing in Native \nAmerican communities nationwide. There are a number of microenterprise \norganizations in states across the country that are willing and \nprepared to take on the additional challenge of assisting disadvantaged \nNative American entrepreneurs, and there are a number of Native \nAmerican communities that are eager to explore a different path to \neconomic development. However, there are currently a limited amount of \nfunds to allow that to happen. Again, I commend Senator Bingaman for \nhis continued attention to these needs, for his continued support of \nsmall business legislation to address them, and for his foresight and \nvision for Native Americans in New Mexico and across the country. The \nNative American communities of our nation will be better off with the \nassistance that this provision makes possible.\n  Again, it is time to move forward. Out of 66 pages of Small Business \nAdministration reauthorizations and improvements that were slipped into \nthe Omnibus Appropriations bill that passed at the end of the 108th \nCongress, these non-controversial provisions were included. They should \nhave been.\n  The third part of the package that I'm introducing today is a \nreintroduction of the Vocational and Technical Entrepreneurship \nDevelopment Act. Last Congress, I introduced this important piece of \nlegislation as a companion to H.R. 1387, which bears the same name and \nwas introduced in the House, in the 107th and 108th Congresses, by \nCongressman Robert Brady of Pennsylvania.\n  Let me begin by reminding my colleagues that the Small Business \nAdministration's Office of Advocacy states that only half of all small \nbusinesses survive past four years and that management and education \nremain two of the most important ingredients to small business success. \nWe often think that small businesses only need money to succeed, but \nwhile adequate financing is vital, so too is careful planning and \ncompetent management. Often Americans who work in the trade sector--\nconstruction, plumbing, electrical work, etc.--enter these professions \nwith the goal of one day starting their own business; however many of \nthese aspiring entrepreneurs who participate in career training or \nvocational training in certain trades, unfortunately, fail to obtain \nthe necessary education and ``back room'' management skills to grow and \ndevelop their fledgling business. This initiative would develop a\n\n[[Page S353]]\n\nprogram that allows workers within the trades industry to move toward \nstarting a new business by giving them the entrepreneurial skills to \nsuccessfully manage a small business. Many small businesses fail not \nbecause they don't know the industry or make low-quality products or \nhave poor service, but because they don't know the ins and outs of \nrunning a successful business.\n  The purpose of the Vocational and Technical Entrepreneurship \nDevelopment Act is to assist in the development of curricula that will \nencourage the successful growth of small businesses. This legislation \npassed the House in each of the last Congresses, but was not taken up \nby the full Senate. I hope that the committee and full Senate will act \nquickly on it now.\n  The bill, in a business-education partnership, establishes a \n``vocational entrepreneurship development demonstration program,'' \nunder which the SBA would provide grants, through the Small Business \nDevelopment Center network, to provide technical assistance to high \nschool and technical career institutes, vo-tech schools, to promote \nsmall business ownership in their curriculum.\n  The SBDC program is designed to deliver such up-to-date counseling, \ntraining and technical assistance in all aspects of small business \nmanagement and is the ideal vehicle to provide such a program. Each \ngrant awarded under this program will be worth at least $200,000--\nwhich, in today's environment where vo-tech programs get shortchanged \nin government education budgets, can do a great deal to help rebuild a \nworker-strapped trades industry.\n  There has been some concern that this legislation will duplicate \nprograms such as those at the Department of Education's Office of \nVocational and Adult Education, OVAE, which does provide valuable \nvocational education. The OVAE, and other such government programs, \nhowever, focus on helping workers gain new and updated skills so that \nthey may find employment. In contrast, this legislation is targeted \ntoward turning workers, not into better employees, but into potential \nemployers. Traditional vocational education programs do not provide \nentrepreneurial training. This is a fundamental difference between this \nlegislation's objective and that of the traditional vocation education \nprovided by the Department of Education. Giving our trades industry \nprofessionals the skills to be successful business owners creates \nbetter employers and better, long-lasting businesses. This, in turn, \nwill go a long way toward creating additional trade jobs across the \ncountry.\n  I again want to commend Representative Brady for his years of hard \nwork on behalf of entrepreneurs not just from his home State but on \nbehalf of every trades industry worker who has ever thought of becoming \nhis or her own boss by starting a business.\n  Mr. President, I urge all of my colleagues to cosponsor and support \nthese three bills.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bills be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n                                 S. 137\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Since the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on our \n     country, communities all across America have been on the \n     front lines in the war against terrorism on United States \n     soil.\n       (2) Since September 11, 2001, communities have been forced \n     to bear a significant portion of the burden that goes along \n     with the war against terrorism, a burden that local \n     governments should not have to bear alone.\n       (3) Our homeland defense will only be as strong as the \n     weakest link at the State and local level. By providing our \n     communities with the resources and tools they need to bolster \n     emergency response efforts and provide for other emergency \n     response initiatives, we will have a better-prepared home \n     front and a stronger America.\n       (4) Homeland security experts have repeatedly called upon \n     Congress to allocate homeland security resources based on \n     threat- and risk-based factors. The National Commission on \n     Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (referred to in this \n     Act as the ``9/11 Commission'') stated in its report: ``We \n     understand the contention that every State and city needs to \n     have some minimum infrastructure for emergency response. But \n     Federal homeland security assistance should not remain a \n     program for general revenue sharing. It should supplement \n     State and local resources based on the risks or vulnerability \n     that merit additional support. Congress should not use this \n     money as a pork barrel.'' The Commission made unequivocally \n     clear that the current method of allocating the majority of \n     Federal homeland security resources to states and local \n     communities, on a per capita basis alone, must be changed.\n       (5) Not only did the 9/11 Commission recommend that such \n     changes be made in how Federal homeland security funds are \n     allocated, but commissions before it, such as the Homeland \n     Security Independent Task Force of the Council on Foreign \n     Relations, chaired by former Senators Gary Hart and Warren \n     Rudman, have strongly recommended it as well.\n       (6) The Hart-Rudman Commission stated almost 2 years ago \n     that ``Congress should establish a system for allocating \n     scarce resources based less on dividing the spoils and more \n     on addressing identified threats and vulnerabilities. To do \n     this, the Federal Government should consider such factors as \n     population, population density, vulnerability assessment, and \n     presence of critical infrastructure within each State.''\n       (7) In addition to the need for threat and risk-based \n     funding, direct funding to our major cities and counties \n     across the country is necessary if we are to ensure that \n     these communities, who are on the front lines of our nation's \n     homeland defense, receive critical Federal homeland security \n     resources quickly and efficiently. Numerous reports by \n     organizations such as the United States Conference of Mayors, \n     have clearly demonstrated that the current method of \n     distributing Federal homeland security resources intended for \n     local communities has not worked. Too often, too many \n     communities receive resources, if at all, years after \n     Congress appropriated the subject funds.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend part A of title IV of the Social Security Act \nto allow up to 24 months of vocational educational training to be \ncounted as a work activity under the temporary assistance to needy \nfamilies program; to the Committee on Finance.\n  I am pleased to be joined by Senator Jeffords in reintroducing \nlegislation that seeks to add an important measure of flexibility to a \nprovision of the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, TANF, \nunder the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation \nAct of 1996. The legislation we are introducing increases the limit on \nthe amount of vocational education training that a State can count \ntowards meeting its work participation rate, from 12 to 24 months.\n  This legislation enjoys the support of the American Association of \nUniversity Women, with over 100,000 members; The Workforce Alliance, a \ncoalition of experienced leaders nationwide from the field of workforce \ndevelopment, who know what works in preparing people for jobs; the \nNational Association of State Directors of Career Technical Education \nConsortium; the Center for law and Social Policy and the American \nAssociation of Community Colleges. \n  Under the pre-1996 Aid to Families with Dependent Children program, \nrecipients could participate in post-secondary vocational training or \ncommunity college programs for up to 24 months. While I support TANF's \nemphasis on moving welfare recipients more quickly into jobs, I am \ntroubled by the restriction on post-secondary education training, \nlimiting it to 12 months. One year of vocational education is, under \ncurrent law, an approved work activity, but the second year of post-\nsecondary education study is not.\n  The limitation on post-secondary education and training raises a \nnumber of concerns, not the least of which is whether individuals may \nbe forced into lower paying, short-term employment that will lead them \nback onto public assistance because they are unable to support \nthemselves or their families. Well, according to recent studies, this \nis exactly what has happened in far too many cases.\n  According to a findings of the Congressional Research Service, \nalthough the majority of recipients who have left the welfare rolls \nleft because they became employed, most remained poor. The research \nalso revealed that the hourly wage for these former welfare recipients \nranged from $5.50 to $8.80 per hour.\n  Study after study indicates that short-term training programs raise \nthe income of workers only marginally, while completion of at least a \n2-year associate degree has the greater potential of breaking the cycle \nof poverty for welfare recipients. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, \nthe mean earnings of adults with an associate degree are 20 percent \nhigher than adults who have not achieved such a degree.\n  In June of 2003, we were very pleased that our proposal was included \nin the Senate Finance Committee reported bill, which reauthorized TANF. \nHowever, the reauthorization bill was not considered by the full \nSenate. Rather the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Act has been \ntwice extended. It is our hope that the Senate will again act favorably \nand expeditiously on this legislation and that the House will support \nthis much-needed State flexibility. We must do what is necessary to \nachieve TANF's intended goal of getting families permanently off of \nwelfare and onto self-sufficiency.\n  All citizens should have the opportunity to become productive and \nsuccessful members of the workforce. Again, I urge my colleagues to act \nquickly on this legislation. This modification will give the States the \nflexibility they need to improve the economic status of families across \nAmerica.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord. \n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 141\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to change the date for regularly scheduled Federal \nelections and establish polling place hours; to the Committee on Rules \nand Administration.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Weekend Voting \nAct. This legislation will change the day for Congressional and \nPresidential elections from the first Tuesday in November to the first \nweekend in November. This legislation is virtually identical to \nlegislation that I first proposed in 1997 in the 105th Congress and \nmost recently reintroduced in the 107th Congress.\n  The last two elections have revealed a glaring need for us to rethink \nhow we conduct elections in our Nation. The 2000 election galvanized \nCongress into passing major election reform legislation. The Help \nAmerican Vote Act, which was enacted into law in 2002, was an important \nstep forward in establishing minimum standards for states in the \nadministration of federal elections and in providing funds to replace \noutdated voting systems and improve election administration. The HAVA \nlegislation also created a new federal agency, the Election Assistance \nCommission, to serve as a clearinghouse for election administration \ninformation. That Commission is finally on its feet after a delayed \nstart.\n  However, as the 2004 election made clear, there is much that still \nneeds to be done.\n  With more and more voters needing to cast their ballots on Election \nDay, we need to build on the movement\n\n[[Page S364]]\n\nwhich already exists to make it easier for Americans to cast their \nballots by providing alternatives to voting on just one election day. \nTwenty-six States, including my own state of Wisconsin, now permit any \nregistered voter to vote by absentee ballot. These States constitute 45 \npercent of the voting age citizens of the United States. Twenty three \nstates permit in-person early voting at election offices or at other \nsatellite locations. The state of Oregon now conducts statewide \nelections completely by mail. These innovations are critical if we are \nto conduct fair elections for it has become unreasonable to expect that \na nation of 294 million people can line up at the same time and cast \ntheir ballots at the same time. And if we continue to try to do so, we \nwill encounter even more reports of broken machines and long lines in \nthe rain and registration errors that create barriers to voting.\n  That is why I have been a long-time advocate of moving our Federal \nelection day from the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November \nto the first weekend in November. Holding our federal elections on a \nweekend will create more opportunities for voters to cast their ballots \nand will help end the gridlock at the polling places which threaten to \nundermine our elections.\n  Under this bill, polls would be open nationwide for a uniform period \nof time from Saturday, 6 p.m. eastern time to Sunday, 6 p.m. eastern \ntime. Polls in other time zones would also open and close at this time. \nElection officials would be permitted to close polls during the \novernight hours if they determine it would be inefficient to keep them \nopen. Because the polls are open from Saturday to Sunday, they also \nwould not interfere with religious observances.\n  Keeping polls open the same hours across the continental United \nStates, also addresses the challenge of keeping results on one side of \nthe country, or even a State, from influencing voting in places where \npolls are still open. Moving elections to the weekend will expand the \npool of buildings available for polling stations and people available \nto work at the polls, addressing the critical shortage of poll workers.\n  Most important, weekend voting has the potential to increase voter \nturnout by giving all voters ample opportunity to get to the polls \nwithout creating a national holiday. There is already evidence that \nholding elections on a non-working day can increase voter turnout. In \none survey of 44 democracies, 29 held elections on holidays or weekends \nand in all these cases voter turnout surpassed our country's voter \nparticipation rates. Closer to home, weekend voting in some California \ncounties resulted in increased voter turnout compared to comparable \nelections held on Tuesdays.\n  In 2001, the National Commission on Federal Election Reform \nrecommended that we move our federal election day to a national \nholiday, in particular Veterans Day. As expected, the proposal was not \nwell received among veterans and I do not endorse such a move, but I \nshare the Commission's goal of moving election day to a non-working \nday.\n  Since the mid-19th century, election day has been on the first \nTuesday of November. Ironically, this date was selected because it was \nconvenient for voters. Tuesdays were traditionally court day, and land-\nowning voters were often coming to town anyway.\n  Just as the original selection of our national voting day was done \nfor voter convenience, we must adapt to the changes in our society to \nmake voting easier for the regular family. Sixty percent of all \nhouseholds have two working adults. Since most polls in the United \nStates are open only 12 hours, from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., voters often have \nonly one or two hours to vote. As we saw in this last election, long \nlines in many polling places kept some waiting much longer than one or \ntwo hours. If voters have children, and are dropping them off at day \ncare, or if they have a long work commute, there is just not enough \ntime in a workday to vote.\n  With long lines and chaotic polling places becoming the unacceptable \nnorm in many communities, we have an obligation to reexamine how our \nNation votes. In the last election, too many Americans had to confront \na variety of obstacles to cast their ballots at their local polling \nplaces. We can do better by offering more flexible voting hours for \nAmericans, especially working families.\n  Serious allegations have been raised about voting irregularities in \nOhio during the 2004 presidential election. I agree with many of my \ncolleagues that these allegations must be investigated to the fullest \nextent possible because every eligible citizen in this nation must have \nan equal opportunity to exercise the constitutional right to cast a \nvote in federal elections.\n  In the meantime, we have an obligation to do more than investigate. \nIf we are to grant all Americans an equal opportunity to participate in \nthe electoral process, and to elect our representatives in this great \ndemocracy, then we must be willing to reexamine all aspects of voting \nin America. Changing our election day to a weekend may seem like a \nchange of great magnitude. Given the stakes--the integrity of future \nelections--I hope my colleagues will recognize it as a common sense \nproposal whose time has come.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Weekend Voting Act be \nprinted in the Record. \n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 144\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

CHANGE IN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION DAY TO SATURDAY AND \n                   SUNDAY.\n\n       Section 1 of title 3, United States Code, is amended by \n     striking ``Tuesday next after the first Monday'' and \n     inserting ``first Saturday and Sunday after the first \n     Friday''.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Res. 1. A joint resolution proposing an amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States relating to marriage; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I would like to first express my gratitude \nto the leadership for making the Marriage Protection Amendment a \npriority in this Congress. The Marriage Protection Amendment is a \nconstitutional amendment that I have introduced today. It is S.J. Res. \n1. In the press conference earlier today I indicated I hoped that the \ndesignation of the number would reflect its priority with the \nleadership. I realize that was an overly optimistic request, but I am \nvery pleased we have the support from leadership that we do and that it \nis among their priority items. We have the complete support of the \nleadership. They all signed as cosponsors on S.J. Res. 1.\n  As of this very moment, we have a quarter of the Senate who have \nsigned on as cosponsors. I think that is fabulous. It is certainly a \nbetter start than we had in the last session. In the last session, if \nmy memory serves me correctly, I think we only had about 13 or so \ncosponsors on it, even after we had the debate in the Senate. So even \nbefore we have sent out a letter to our colleagues in the Senate, we \nhave 25 original cosponsors. I am excited about that.\n  So today we have reintroduced the Marriage Protection Amendment in \nthe Senate. The intent and policy goals remain the same as last year. \nIt is the same bill we debated on the floor of the Senate. What it does \nis define marriage as a union between a man and a woman.\n  The amendment represents a democratic process: the voice of the \nAmerican people following recent and widespread efforts by activist \ncourts to change this ages-old definition of marriage.\n  People say, well, what about the rights of the State legislature? \nWhat we are trying to do is protect the voice of the American people. \nThe right place for this to be determined is in the legislative bodies \nof this country, in the Congress of the United States and each and \nevery legislature in every State, and not in the Federal courts. The \namendment does restrict the ability of the courts to define marriage. \nThe Marriage Protection Amendment does not override State and local \nauthority. Under the Marriage Protection Amendment, cities, States, and \nprivate companies would still be free to determine for themselves civil \nunion, benefit, and partnership definitions.\n  The Marriage Protection Amendment would not permit the redefining of \nmarriage, a definition agreed upon by every civilization, culture, \nethnicity, and religion around the world.\n  The definition of marriage in itself is not discriminatory. Those who \nhave been opposed to the amendment tried to make that argument in the \nlast session. Even civil rights leaders, Hispanic and African \nAmericans, have said this is not a civil rights issue.\n  Congress does have a vital role to play in this debate. The policy \ngoals are widely agreed upon. Recent election results illustrate broad \nsupport for the definition of marriage.\n  Mr. President, 14 million voters in 11 States voted for \nconstitutional amendments on November 2, 2004, with an average majority \nof 67 percent. This reflects great support throughout the country. Some \n13 States voted on the ballot issue in 2004.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the information on \nthis chart printed in the Record, which illustrates what happened in \neach one of those elections.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                                      2004 STATEWIDE BALLOT RESULTS ON MARRIAGE AMENDMENTS\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                                  Signatures turned\n               State             Date of vote         Referred by      Vote in legislature  Signatures required           in           Certified by SOS     Outcome of vote       Percentages\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1       Arkansas...........

The emphasis here must be on the process, democratic, \ndeliberative, and responsive to the electorate, not to just appointed \njudges and lawyers. We want the American public to have a say in this \ndebate. Courtrooms are not the place for this important decision about \nthe most fundamental institution of mankind, and that is the definition \nof marriage. Courts should interpret the law, not write it.\n  So we are eager to begin to have hearings, to talk about the \nresearch, to debate and have constructive dialog on this very important \nissue. It is important to the American people. It is important we \ncontinue to move forward with the momentum that has evolved as a result \nof our debate last year and the momentum that has evolved as a result \nof the elections of this past fall.\n  I am excited about introducing the Marriage Protection Amendment, \nwhich is exactly the same amendment we debated on the floor of the \nSenate last year.\n  Mr. President, before I wrap up, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nCoburn be added as an original cosponsor and Senator Stevens be added \nas an original cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Again, in conclusion, I thank the leadership for their \nsupport and my colleagues for their support on this particular \namendment. We had a number of elections for Senate seats where this was \na very important issue and critical to the election of many of our new \nMembers in the Senate. We have at least five votes that have switched \nas a result of this election. I think that is the American people \nhaving an opportunity to speak their mind.\n\n[[Page S366]]\n\n  I can say, this amendment is to protect the voice of the American \npeople. The proper way to have this debate is in the legislative bodies \nof America. That includes the Congress and each and every legislature.\n  Again, I thank the leader for his leadership on this particular \nissue. I also thank my colleagues who showed up at the press conference \nthis morning to talk about this issue, particularly Senator Santorum, \nSenator Hutchison, Senator Sessions, and Senator Thune who joined me in \nthe press conference. I thank them for their leadership this morning in \nthat press conference.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe joint resolution be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the joint resolution was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. 1\n\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled (two-thirds of \n     each House concurring therein), That the following article is \n     proposed as an amendment to the Constitution of the United \n     States, which shall be valid to all intents and purposes as \n     part of the Constitution when ratified by the legislatures of \n     three-fourths of the several States:\n\n                              ``Article --\n\n       ``Section 1.

Neither this \n     Constitution, nor the constitution of any State, shall be \n     construed to require that marriage or the legal incidents \n     thereof be conferred upon any union other than the union of a \n     man and a woman.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAIG:\n  S.J. Res. 2. A joint resolution proposing an amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States relative to require a balanced budget \nand protect Social Security surpluses; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing the Balanced \nBudget Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. When we were \nin deficit and when we were in surplus, I have always said, if we could \nadopt one fundamental reform to the way the Federal Government does \nbusiness, this is it. The fiscal events of the last few years have \nagain demonstrated the need for this long-term, fundamental, permanent \nreform.\n  For many Americans, one of the signs of our deep respect for the \nConstitution is our acknowledgment that, in exceptional cases, a \nproblem rises to such a level that it can be adequately addressed only \nin the Constitution--by way of a constitutional amendment.\n  From 1998 through 2001, Congress balanced the Federal budget. These \nfour budget surpluses in a row, for the first time since the 1920s, set \nthe modern record for balancing the Federal budget. The first \nRepublican Congresses in 40 years made balancing the budget our top \npriority, and did what was necessary, reaching across the aisle and \nworking on a bipartisan basis. We ran surpluses and began the process \nwe needed to pay down the national debt. This in turn promised, among \nother things, to help us safeguard the future of Social Security.\n  Then events intervened.\n  A return to budget deficits was caused by an economic recession and a \nwar begun by terrorist attacks. Even before taking office in 2001, \nPresident Bush correctly foresaw the coming recession and prescribed \nthe right medicine--the tax relief that has bolstered the economy and \nhas saved and created jobs. The current economic recovery, in turn, has \nprevented even worse Federal budget deficits.\n  The return to deficit spending can and should be a temporary \nphenomenon. We are rebounding from the recession of 2001 and the body \nblow to the economy caused by the war with terrorism.\n  We must do whatever it takes to win that war. Providing for the self-\ndefense and survival of our people and our Nation is the most \nfundamental responsibility of the Federal Government. That principle \nhas been reflected in every significant version of the balanced budget \nconstitutional amendment, in exceptions for war and imminent military \nthreats. Historically, that principle was followed even when balancing \nthe budget was the norm, because the U.S. Government always has \nborrowed when necessary to fight and win a war.\n  Beyond that, we must keep all other Federal spending under control, \nso that we return, as soon as possible, to balancing the budget.\n  In other words, the return to deficit spending will be a temporary \nproblem only if we make a permanent commitment to the moral imperative \nof fiscal responsibility.\n  We always did, and always will, need a balanced budget amendment to \nour Constitution.\n  Even in the heady days of budget surpluses, I always maintained the \nonly way to guarantee that the Federal Government would stay fiscally \nresponsible was to add a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution.\n  Before we balanced the budget in 1998, the Government was deficit \nspending for 28 years in a row and for 59 out of 67 years. The basic \nlaw of political temptation--to just say ``yes''--was not repealed in \n1998, but only restrained some, when we came together and briefly faced \nup to the great threat to the future posed by decades of debt.\n  Now, the Government is back to borrowing. And for some, a return to \ndeficit spending seems to have been liberating, as the demands for new \nspending only seem to be multiplying again.\n  That is why, today, I am again introducing a balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution and calling upon my colleagues to send it \nto the States for ratification.\n  The amendment I introduce today is the same one I sponsored in the \n108th Congress. This is essentially the same as the amendment that came \nwithin a single vote of the two-thirds necessary for passage, twice in \ntwo previous Senates. In addition, this amendment would not count the \nSocial Security surplus in its calculation of a balanced budget. Those \nannual surpluses would be set aside exclusively to meet the future \nneeds of Social Security beneficiaries.\n  It's a new day, a new year, and a new Senate. We have the opportunity \nof a fresh start and, hopefully, the wisdom of experience. Today, with \nthe first piece of legislation I am introducing in the 109th Congress, \nI call on the Senate to safeguard the future, by considering and \npassing a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution--a bill of \neconomic rights for our future and our children.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this joint resolution, \nproposing a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the joint resolution was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the first piece \nof legislation that I will sponsor in the 109th Congress--a resolution \ncalling on the Senate to strengthen the Pell grant program so that more \nfamilies can afford higher education.\n  The Pell grant program is the single largest source of grant aid for \npostsecondary education funded by the Federal Government. It provides \ngrants to students based on their level of financial need to support \ntheir studies at the institutions they have chosen to attend. For this \nfiscal year, the Pell program is funded at $12.8 billion and is \nestimated to serve more than 5.3 million students.\n  I am pleased to have Senator Feingold and Senator Coleman joining me \nin this bipartisan effort to marshal additional Federal resources for \nthe Pell program. They each have been a leader in the effort to expand \naccess to higher education.\n  Our system of higher education is in many ways the envy of the world, \nbut its benefits have not been equally available. Unfortunately, it is \nstill the case that one of the most determinative factors of whether \nstudents will pursue higher education is their family income. Students \nfrom families with incomes above $75,000 are more than twice as likely \nto attend college as students from families with incomes of less that \n$25,000.\n  Even more unsettling are studies demonstrating the negative effect of \nunmet financial need on college attendance for even the most \nacademically prepared students. Among the most highly qualified high \nschool students, those from low-income families were 43 percent less \nlikely to attend college than their wealthier counterparts.\n  To help remedy these inequities, the Federal Government has wisely \ninvested in a need-based system of student financial aid designed to \nhelp remove the economic barriers to higher education. Central to this \neffort over the past 30 years has been the Pell grant program. This \nprogram was designed as the cornerstone of Federal student assistance.\n  Unfortunately, the purchasing power of the Pell grant has been \nsignificantly eroded in recent years, forcing students to rely \nincreasingly on loans to finance their higher education. In 1975, the \nmaximum Pell grant covered approximately 80 percent of the costs of \nattending a public, 4-year institution. Today, it covers less than half \nof these costs, forcing students to make up the difference by taking on \nlarger and larger amounts of debt. On average, students from the \nUniversity of Maine graduate with approximately $18,000 in debt from \nFederal student loans alone, and this reflects national trends. As \nstartling as this figure is, it does not include additional \nindebtedness that many students incur through private loans or credit \ncard debt to finance their education.\n  The decline in the value of grant aid and the growing reliance on \nloans bring other negative consequences. The staggering amount of loans \ncan force some students to abandon their plans to attend college \naltogether. According to the College Board, low-income families are \nsignificantly less willing, by almost 50 percent, to finance a college \neducation through borrowed money than their wealthier counterparts.\n  That does not surprise me. Many working families in Maine are \ncommitted to living within their means. Understandably, they are \nextremely wary of the staggering amount of debt that is now required to \nfinance a college education.\n  I also know this to be true from my experiences as a college \nadministrator at Husson College in Maine. At Husson, 85 to 90 percent \nof students currently receive some sort of Federal financial aid, and \napproximately 60 percent of students receive Pell grants.\n\n  As Linda Conant, the financial aid director at Husson told me, ``You \ncannot imagine how difficult it is to sit with a family and to explain \nto them the amount of loans that are needed to finance a post-secondary \ndegree. It\n\n[[Page S368]]\n\nscares them. That is why Pell grant aid is so important for low-income \nfamilies. For these families, loans don't always work, but Pell does.''\n  I also heard from Judy Kenney from Northern Maine about the \nimportance of Pell grants. Judy lives in Castle Hill, not far from my \nhome town of Caribou. Her daughter and son both were able to attend \ncollege with the help of Pell grants. As she told me, ``At the time, my \nhusband Maylen was farming and having a rough go of it and I was a \nteacher and didn't make much. But the Pell grants my children received \nmade it possible for them to graduate, one from the University of New \nEngland and one from Thomas College. Without these grants, they \ncouldn't have finished and now they are making good wages and paying \ntaxes!''\n  Judy couldn't be more right on both counts. Not only can the typical \nbachelor's degree recipient expect to earn about 73 percent more over a \nlifetime than a high school graduate, they also typically contribute \n100 percent more in Federal income taxes than the average high school \ngraduate. So this is truly a Federal investment that pays for itself \nover the long run.\n  We also know that having a well-educated workforce is crucial to our \neconomic future and competitiveness in the global economy. The Bureau \nof Labor Statistics has projected that over the next 10 years, there \nwill be significant growth in jobs requiring at least some post-\nsecondary education. So increasingly, higher education is going to be \nnecessary to ensure employability and to prepare Americans to \nparticipate in tomorrow's economy.\n  Pell grants make the difference in whether students have access to \nhigher education, and a chance to participate fully in the American \ndream. That is why today I am introducing a resolution calling on the \nSenate to begin restoring the value of the Pell grant program.\n  This resolution calls on the Senate to raise the Pell maximum grant \naward to $4,500, a $450 increase in a single year. This increase is \nlong overdue. The maximum grant award has been essentially level-funded \nfor 4 straight years--at $4,050 for the past 3 years and only a $50 \nincrease in FY 2002.\n  During these 4 years, think of the students who might have entered \ncollege and graduated with a degree, if only they had received \nadditional Pell grant aid. Pell grants are targeted to the neediest of \nstudents--recipients have a median family income of only $15,200. An \nadditional $450 in Pell grant aid may very well be the deciding factor \non whether these students can pursue their college dreams.\n  The resolution also calls on the Senate to amend the Higher Education \nAct to provide higher authorization levels for the Pell maximum grant \nthat would allow for a doubling of the maximum grant to $9,000 over the \nnext 5 years. This is an ambitious goal but a worthy one for a nation \nthat understands the opportunities that a college education brings.\n  As my colleagues know, the Higher Education Act is expected to be \nreauthorized this year. As the Senate HELP Committee considers the \nreauthorization, it is my hope that this resolution will prompt a \ndiscussion about the need for the maximum grant to grow.\n  I know that my good friends Senator Enzi, the new chairman of the \nSenate HELP Committee; Senator Kennedy, the ranking member; Senator \nAlexander, the chairman of the new Education and Early Childhood \nDevelopment Subcommittee; and his Democratic counterpart will all work \nhard with other committee members to produce a strong reauthorization \nbill. I look forward to working with them further; they are all \nchampions of ensuring greater access to quality education for all \nAmericans, regardless of their financial means.\n  The President also has recently announced his intention to include a \nproposal in his 2006 budget request to eliminate the Pell shortfall and \nto provide an increase in the maximum grant of $100 for each of the \nnext 5 years. I commend the President for focusing on Pell grants, and \nI hope that we can work together to provide a more substantial increase \nfor the maximum grant for the upcoming year. An increase of \napproximately $100 for each of the next 5 years will not be enough to \nincrease the purchasing power of Pell grants and will not keep pace \nwith inflation or rising tuition costs. For 2004-2005, the average \ncosts of tuition and fees for a public, 4-year institution rose by over \n10 percent.\n  I will ask unanimous consent to have a letter of support for my \nlegislation printed in the Record. This letter is from the Student Aid \nAlliance, a coalition of more than 60 organizations representing \nstudents, colleges and universities. Founded by the American Council on \nEducation and the National Association of Independent Colleges and \nUniversities, the Student Aid Alliance includes members such as the \nAmerican Association of Community Colleges, the American Association of \nState Colleges and Universities, and the National Association of \nStudent Financial Aid Administrators, to name just a few. I am pleased \nto have their support.\n  Mr. President, now is the time for us to make a commitment to raising \nthe Pell maximum award to $4,500 for the upcoming award year. The Pell \ngrant program is the foundation of making good on the American promise \nof access to higher education. I hope that my colleagues will join me \nin supporting this resolution.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the letter to which I referred \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n                                         Student Aid Alliance,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 24, 2005.\n     Re support for Collins-Feingold Resolution on Pell Grants\n\n       Dear Senator: The Student Aid Alliance, a coalition of over \n     60 higher education associations representing students, \n     parents, colleges and universities, supports the passage of \n     the Collins-Feingold resolution to increase the Pell Grant \n     maximum award to $4,500 in the 2005-06 award year, and to \n     double the maximum over the next 5 years. We urge the Senate \n     to adopt this legislation, which paves the way toward \n     achieving increased support for students seeking to finance a \n     college education.\n       The Pell Grant program is one of the most successful \n     programs that the federal government has ever initiated. It \n     has financed the education of millions of college students \n     who are now contributing members of society--doctors, \n     teachers, mayors, and members of Congress. It is rooted in \n     the abiding American value that one's aspirations--not one's \n     income--should determine the shape of one's future.\n       Increasing the Pell Grant maximum award by $450 is vitally \n     important to the millions of college students who have seen \n     no increase in their grants for the past three years in a \n     row. During this period, the college-age population has \n     continued to expand, states have been cutting their \n     investments in higher education, and family savings have been \n     diminished by economic losses. Increasing the Pell Grant \n     maximum award is an essential and necessary component of \n     keeping college possible for these students.\n       Passage of the Collins-Feingold resolution will signal \n     Congress' interest in and support of America's neediest \n     students. We encourage you to support this important \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n     David Ward,\n       Co-Chair.\n     David Warren,\n       Co-Chair.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                          2005 List of Members\n\n       American Association for Higher Education\n       American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education\n       American Association of Colleges of Nursing\n       American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy\n       American Association of Collegiate Registrars and \n     Admissions Officers\n       American Association of Community Colleges\n       American Dental Education Association\n       American Association of State Colleges and Universities\n       American Association of University Professors\n       American College Personnel Association\n       American College Testing\n       American Council on Education\n       American Indian Higher Education Consortium\n       American Jewish Congress\n       American Psychological Association\n       American Society for Engineering Education\n       American Student Association of Community Colleges\n       APPA: The Association of Higher Education Facilities \n     Officers\n       Association of Academic Health Centers\n       Association of Advanced Rabbinical and Talmudic Schools\n       Association of American Colleges and Universities\n\n[[Page S369]]\n\n       Association of American Law Schools\n       Association of American Medical Colleges\n       Association of American Universities\n       Association of Catholic Colleges and Universities\n       Association of Community College Trustees\n       Association of Governing Boards of Universities and \n     Colleges\n       Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities\n       Citizen's Scholarship Foundation of Arnerica\n       Coalition of Higher Education Assistance Organizations\n       College and University Personnel Association for Human \n     Resources\n       College Board\n       College Parents of America\n       Council for Advancement and Support of Education\n       Council for Christian Colleges and Universities\n       Council for Higher Education Accreditation\n       Council of Graduate Schools\n       Council of Independent Colleges\n       Council for Opportunity in Education\n       Educational Testing Service\n       Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities\n       Lutheran Educational Conference of North America\n       NAFSA: Association of International Educators\n       National Association for College Admission Counseling\n       National Association for Equal Opportunity in Higher \n     Education\n       National Association of College and University Business \n     Officers\n       National Association of Graduate and Professional Students\n       National Association of Independent Colleges and \n     Universities\n       National Association of State Student Grant and Aid \n     Programs\n       National Association of State Universities and Land-Grant \n     Colleges\n       National Association of Student Financial Aid \n     Administrators\n       National Association of Student Personnel Administrators\n       National College Access Network\n       National Collegiate Athletic Association\n       National Council for Community and Education Partnerships\n       National Council of University Research Administrators\n       National Education Association\n       NAWE: Advancing Women in Higher Education\n       The Council on Government Relations\n       United Negro College Fund\n       United States Public Interest Research Group\n       United States Student Association\n       University Continuing Education Association\n       Women's College Coalition\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 9--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING \n  DESIGNATION OF THE MONTH OF NOVEMBER AS ``NATIONAL MILITARY FAMILY \n                                MONTH''\n\n  Mr. INOUYE submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                               S. Res. 9\n\n       Whereas military families, through their sacrifices and \n     their dedication to our Nation and its values, represent the \n     bedrock upon which our Nation was founded and upon which our \n     Nation continues to rely in these perilous and challenging \n     times: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate--\n       (1) that the month of November should be designated as \n     ``National Military Family Month''; and\n       (2) to request that the President--\n       (A) designate the month of November as ``National Military \n     Family Month''; and\n       (B) issue a proclamation calling upon the people of the \n     United States to observe the month with appropriate \n     ceremonies and activities.\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I rise to honor all our military \nfamilies by introducing a Resolution to designate November as National \nMilitary Family Month. As we all know, memories fade and the hardships \nexperienced by our military families are easily forgotten unless they \ntouch our own immediate family.\n  Today, we have our men and women deployed all over the world, engaged \nin this war on terrorism. These far-ranging military deployments are \nextremely difficult on the families who bear this heavy burden.\n  To honor these families, the Armed Services YMCA has sponsored \nMilitary Family Week in late November since 1996. However, due to \nfrequent ``short week'' conflicts around the Thanksgiving holidays, the \ndesignated week has not always afforded enough time to schedule \nobservance on and near our military bases.\n  I believe a month long observation will allow greater opportunity to \nplan events. Moreover, it will provide a greater opportunity to \nstimulate media support.\n  A resolution will help pave the way for this effort. I ask my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting this tribute to our military \nfamilies.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 3--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE CONGRESS \n               WITH RESPECT TO THE MURDER OF EMMETT TILL\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER (for himself and Mr. Talent) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the \nJudiciary:\n\n                             S.

Milam, \n     kidnaped Emmett Till from his uncle Moses Wright's home;\n       Whereas Bryant and Milam brutally beat Emmett Till, took \n     him to the edge of the Tallahatchie River, shot him in the \n     head, fastened a large metal fan used for ginning cotton to \n     his neck with barbed wire, and pushed the body into the \n     river;\n       Whereas 3 days later, Emmett Till's decomposed corpse was \n     pulled from the Tallahatchie River;\n       Whereas Emmett's mother, Mamie Till, made the extraordinary \n     decision to leave the casket open at her son's funeral in \n     Chicago, in order to allow the world to see the brutality of \n     the crime perpetrated against her son;\n       Whereas tens of thousands of people viewed Emmett Till's \n     body in a Chicago church for 4 days; and press from around \n     the world published photographs of Emmett's maimed face; and \n     the sheer brutality of his murder became international news \n     that highlighted the violent racism of the Jim Crow South;\n       Whereas Jet Magazine and the Chicago Defender published \n     photographs of Emmett Till's body outraging African-Americans \n     around the United States;\n       Whereas the trial of J.W. Milam and Roy Bryant began in \n     September of that year with an all-male, all-White jury, \n     because African-Americans and women were banned from serving;\n       Whereas the trial of Milam and Bryant was a microcosm of \n     the Jim Crow South: African-Americans were packed in a \n     specific section of the courtroom balcony; the defendants' \n     families were seen laughing and joking with the prosecution \n     and the jury; and food and snacks were passed out to White \n     observers;\n       Whereas Moses Wright did the unthinkable as an African-\n     American and openly accused the White defendants in public \n     court of murdering his nephew;\n       Whereas Moses Wright was run out of town for his actions in \n     court;\n       Whereas J.W. Milam and Roy Bryant were acquitted of the \n     murder of Emmett Till, and Bryant celebrated his acquittal \n     with his wife in front of the cameras;\n       Whereas protected from further prosecution, Milam and \n     Bryant candidly confessed their torture and murder of Emmett \n     Till; Milam did so on the record to Look Magazine for $4,000;\n       Whereas Mamie Till and thousands of others pleaded with the \n     Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation \n     to reopen and investigate the case;\n       Whereas the Federal Government did absolutely nothing, and \n     President Eisenhower and FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover refused \n     to reopen the case and did not even answer Mamie Till's \n     urgent telegraph;\n       Whereas 100 days later, Rosa Parks refused to give up her \n     bus seat to a White patron and the modern civil rights \n     revolution began;\n       Whereas many historians regard the murder of Emmett Till as \n     the true spark of the civil rights movement;\n       Whereas Mamie Till, who died on January 6, 2003, moved back \n     to Chicago, taught, and continued to talk about her son \n     Emmett's murder; and expressed her wishes for a full Federal \n     investigation;\n       Whereas more than 48 years have passed since the murder of \n     Emmett Till;\n       Whereas the remaining witnesses to this gruesome crime are \n     elderly;\n       Whereas House Concurrent Resolution 360 entitled \n     ``Expressing the sense of Congress with respect to the murder \n     of Emmett Till'', was introduced on February 10, 2004, by \n     Representative Bobby Rush;\n       Whereas the Department of Justice reopened the \n     investigation into the murder of Emmett Till on May 11, 2004; \n     and\n       Whereas Congress supports the decision to reopen the \n     investigation of the murder of Emmett Till: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) calls on all authorities with jurisdiction, including \n     the Department of Justice and the State of Mississippi, to--\n\n[[Page S370]]\n\n       (A) expeditiously bring those responsible for the murder of \n     Emmett Till to justice, due to the amount of time that has \n     passed since the murder and the age of the witnesses; and\n       (B) provide all the resources necessary to ensure a timely \n     and thorough investigation; and\n       (2) calls on the Department of Justice to fully report the \n     findings of their investigation to Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/24/senate-section/article/S370-1", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S370]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NOTICES OF HEARINGS/MEETINGS\n\n\n                      COMMITTEE ON INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\n  Mr. McCAIN.
