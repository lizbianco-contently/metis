Mr. President, I rise today to speak to legislation that \nwill be introduced by myself and others later today that focuses on an \nissue which has for too long been neglected, not just by our people or \nour Government but, indeed, peoples around the world. It centers on the \nissue of access to safe water and sanitation. This legislation focuses \non developing countries with specific policies outlined in the \nlegislation. I am pleased we have Members on both sides of the aisle \njoining me as original cosponsors of this legislation which will be \nintroduced later today.\n  It boils down to the simple fact that every 15 seconds, a child dies \nbecause of a disease contracted from unclean water. Four children have \ndied since I began talking on this particular issue.\n  Fully 90 percent of infant deaths, of deaths of children less than 5 \nyears of age, relate to waterborne illnesses, a product of lack of \naccess to clean water or inadequate sanitation. In total, water-related \nillnesses kill 14,000 people a day, and most of them are children. That \nis over 5 million people a year. It does not include the other millions \nof individuals who will be debilitated and prevented from living \nhealthy lives.\n  Globally, in many ways, waterborne disease is a silent tsunami. That \nis the impact it has on a continuing basis. Now is the time to focus on \nit. Now is the time to act because these are preventable deaths. \nTyphoid, cholera, dysentery, dengue fever, trachoma, intestinal \nhelminth infection, and schistosomiasis can all be prevented by simply \nproviding safe water and sanitation. More than 1.1 billion people today \nlack access to clean water. They do not have access to what we take for \ngranted. We can go to the water faucets and drink water in most parts \nof this country, but lack of access to that clean water is killing a \nchild every 15 seconds. Malaria, which is a mosquito-borne disease \ndirectly linked with stagnant pools of water, kills 1 million people \neach year. Again, most of those are young children. It is preventable.\n\n[[Page S1886]]\n\n  Unfortunately, reliable projections suggest that the problem is bad, \nbut projections are that it is getting worse. We know it is getting \nworse. Water stress and water scarcity, leading to disease-borne and \nimpure water, is increasing. If we look forward to 2025, upwards of \ntwo-thirds of the world's population may be subject to water stress.\n  There are over 260 river basins across the world that are shared by \ntwo or more countries that actually share the water basins. There are \n13 basins that flow through 5 or more countries. There, water is scarce \nwhere it is shared by so many. Yet it is so necessary that scarcity \ncan, historically, result in armed conflict. Clean water seems so \nsimple. It seems so basic. In America, we, for the most part, take it \nfor granted. The rest of the world cannot.\n  UNICEF reports that over half of the world's schools lack safe water \nand sanitation. In many parts of the world, including in Africa where I \nhave the opportunity to visit, people travel not just an hour but 3 and \n4 hours to provide water on a daily basis for their family. In many \nways, it becomes a women's issue globally because in most countries \nthat burden falls upon women who are pulled away from addressing other \nissues such as their children and family. It takes time going to that \nwater source and carrying it home.\n\n  Imagine living in a rural village in Sub-Saharan Africa or East Asia \nwhere village members share their water with livestock, where you have \ncontamination occurring on an ongoing basis. Imagine being a \ngrandmother like Mihiret G-Maryam from a small village in Ethiopia who \nwatched five of her grandchildren between the ages of 3 and 8 die from \nwater-related diseases. Before the U.K.-based WaterAid organization \nintervened in her community, constant stomach pain and diarrhea were a \nfact of life, an accepted fact of life. The foul-smelling contaminated \nwater exposed Mihiret and her neighbors to parasitic diseases. They had \nno latrines. Human waste, human excretions were everywhere.\n  As Mihiret testifies:\n\n       It was horrid to see, as well as being unhealthy.\n\n  Now, because of the education and investment of WaterAid, together \nwith the local church, her village is clean, and people no longer have \nto suffer from that chronic stomach ache, pain, and diarrhea. Clean \nwater has literally saved lives. This story demonstrates that proper \nmanagement and intervention can be a currency for peace and \ninternational cooperation.\n  On my medical missions, I have seen this on a daily basis. Most \nrecently, in January, a bipartisan group of Senators went to East Asia \nto serve in the aftermath of the December 26 tsunami. As I have \nmentioned in the Senate, traveling over the Sri Lanka coast for \nhundreds and hundreds of miles, we could see that devastation was \nnonstop. We saw the destruction of local water sources, water buckets \nwashed away, and the contamination of wells with saltwater.\n  We know the statistics: Well over 150,000 people died, and a million \nlost their homes. Many are still missing as of today. Thousands of \nchildren will grow up without their parents. It will take a lot of time \nand, yes, a lot of resources to rebuild that infrastructure. A lot of \npeople will never recover from the psychological shock, and the scale \nof the tragedy is difficult to comprehend.\n  I mention that because if you look at what happened in the tsunami, \nit illustrates what can happen when one focuses aggressively on relief \nwith clean water. The tsunami poisoned wells, and the routine \ndependence on water was taken away. That lack of access to clean water \nintroduced the potential for dysentery, for cholera, and for malaria.\n  As we flew over the coast we could look out the window and see \nstagnant pools of water that, if left, will become a source of breeding \nfor the mosquitos that ultimately could have led to a malaria epidemic. \nThose things did not happen because of the rapid relief addressing \nclean water and sanitation. We participated in these relief efforts. \nMany participated in some way.\n  What is critical to understand in the immediate aftermath of the \ntsunami is that there are long-term solutions to the problem \nsurrounding water which we in this body and our Government have not yet \naddressed. But when you have a child dying every 15 seconds from a \npreventable cause--that is, lack of access to clean water--there are \nthings we can do to focus and, hopefully, prevent thousands and \nthousands of deaths that occur now every week.\n  March 22nd is designated by the U.N. General Assembly Resolution 58/\n217 World Water Day and will launch the International Decade For \nAction. That will launch an initiative called Water for Life. For the \ndecade ahead--that is the next 10 years--from 2005 to 2015, the United \nStates has agreed to work to reduce by one-half ``the proportion of \npeople who are unable to reach or afford safe drinking water along with \naccess to basic sanitation.''\n\n  The President and the administration have taken steps to fulfill \nthese commitments. In August 2002, the Water for the Poor Initiative \nwas launched with the intent to improve sustainable management of fresh \nwater resources in over 70 developing countries. An estimated $750 \nmillion was invested in this initiative in 2004.\n  However, in a time of limited public resources, we find that in that \nyear only a little over 6 percent, or about a 20th of total U.S. \nforeign assistance funding for water activities, was targeted for sub-\nSaharan Africa. Yet it is in sub-Saharan Africa that the major problem, \nfor the most part, rests. It is an allocation of resources that we need \nto examine to see if it is appropriate instead of investing where the \nproblem is. If the objective is to save lives, the allocation of our \nresources seems to be going to other areas. Sub-Saharan Africa is not \nonly where we have the greatest problem today, but it has the fastest \ngrowing population. Thus, they will have some of the greatest need for \nclean water and sanitation in the future.\n  As we look at the legislation we will be introducing, we all \nrecognize there is no single piece of legislation that can fully \naddress this huge challenge before us to eliminate these water-related \ndiseases around the world. But I do think this legislation underscores \nthe importance, in a bipartisan way, of continued leadership in this \narena of addressing a problem that has been hidden from the world for \ntoo long. Alongside Government leadership, many dedicated \norganizations, private individuals, faith-based organizations, \nnonprofits, and international governmental organizations are working \nhard, each in their own ways, to address this challenge.\n  The bipartisan legislation we are introducing today has three simple \nobjectives.\n  No. 1, it would make it clear that we would have an unequivocal \npronouncement that clean, safe water and sanitation, sound water \nmanagement, and improved hygiene for people around the world is a major \npolicy goal of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. It becomes a major \npolicy goal. It is not today, but it should be. And with this \nlegislation it will be.\n  Second, it would authorize a 5-year pilot program of $250 million a \nyear to assist those countries that have the highest rates of \nwaterborne diseases. This is what it does: It helps them develop \nfunding mechanisms such as investment insurance, investment guarantees, \nor loan guarantees of up to 75 percent to develop sustainable--the key \nword is ``sustainable''--water infrastructure systems.\n  Third, the legislation directs the Secretary of State, along with the \nAdministrator of the USAID, to develop within 180 days a national \nstrategy that would both assess what is being done today and what \nchanges need to be made in order to expand access to safe water and \nsanitation. This national strategy would be produced in consultation \nwith all of the Federal agencies addressing components of this problem \ntoday, along with appropriate international organizations, foreign \ncountries, and U.S. nongovernmental associations and entities.\n\n  I will close with mentioning this, as well: In the weeks ahead, I \nwill introduce companion legislation to create a global health corps \nthat will be using the Peace Corps as a model and inspiration. It will \nallow teams of medical professionals and other volunteers to travel to \nremote areas to provide medical treatment and public health \ninformation. Some of these teams will provide quick assistance when \ndisaster\n\n[[Page S1887]]\n\nstrikes. Some will provide ongoing care in some of the neediest parts \nof the world. And many of these health volunteers would come from the \nranks of experienced doctors, nurses, and medical technicians.\n  We know that such public health and medical assistance can serve as a \ncurrency of peace and a vital tool of public diplomacy. Our assistance \nto other nations carries the most weight when it involves that personal \nand intimate contact at the community level, and where it also provides \ntangible benefits to everyday people. Medical and public health \nassistance does both of these things. Thus, it can be used as a \ncurrency of peace and a vital tool of public diplomacy.\n  I look forward to the Foreign Relations Committee reporting this \nlegislation in the near future, and I look forward to enacting this \nlegislation expeditiously. Remember, every 15 seconds a child dies \nsomewhere in the world from a waterborne illness because of a lack of \naccess to clean water.\n  In the short time I have given this statement on the Senate floor, \nanother 50 children have died from diseases we know how to prevent. We \nmust do our part to bring health and hope to the millions of people who \nneed clean water. It is as simple as the glass of water that sits on my \ndesk.\n  I do thank the Democratic leader. We have been talking and working \ntogether on this legislation. I believe this can represent a tremendous \nbipartisan, ultimately bicameral effort that can reverse a human \ntragedy that is unfolding before our eyes as a product, at least in \npart, because of inadequate attention.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Democratic leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, these 50 children who have died during the \npresentation by the majority leader are children, of course, who have \nparents, and brothers and sisters in most instances. The grief and \nheartache is multiplied each day with the death of children. I \nappreciate very much the majority leader reaching out to make sure this \nis a bipartisan piece of legislation. I think it sets a good tone that \nthe two leaders are moving forward on an initiative that speaks of the \ngoodness of America. That is what this is all about. We care about \nchildren dying, wherever it happens.\n  We have the unique situation in this Senate that we have one of the \nleaders, the Republican leader, who is a medical doctor. During his \ntenure in the Senate, he has traveled the world looking at medical \nproblems that exist and there is no bigger problem than water.\n  Our former colleague who recently passed away, Paul Simon from \nIllinois, wrote a book, ``Tapped Out.'' In that book, he mentioned some \nof the things I have said. The State of Nevada is different from the \nState of Tennessee. We have what we call rivers, but they are tiny, \nlittle. I do not know what they would be called in most States.\n  The Colorado River is a river that at times can be a mighty river, \nbut the rest of the rivers we have in Nevada are tiny, little rivers. \nThe Truckee River, which supplies the second largest city in Nevada, \nReno, with all its water, is a little stream. You can walk across it in \nmost places. The world-famous city of Las Vegas gets 4 inches of rain \nevery year.\n  We need to do something about the lack of water around the country, \nand not only the lack of water but the quality of the water. A lot of \nplaces have water, but it is not water you can drink and stay healthy \nwith.\n  I am pleased to join the majority leader in cosponsoring this \nimportant legislation. We are going to introduce it later today. Our \nstaffs are working on the language.\n  With this legislation, we are seeking to do something meaningful for \nthe hundreds of millions of people across the globe who lack safe and \nclean water. It is something so basic, yet so critical to human life. \nImproving the delivery and access of clean and safe water, better \nhygiene and medicine, that is what this bill seeks to achieve.\n  No one knows more in this body than the majority leader, from his \ntravels in Africa and elsewhere, that over a billion people--and that \nis probably a figure that is too low--lack access to clean water. Each \nyear, as has been indicated, millions of people die. We do not know how \nmany people, but at least 5 million people die from water-related \ndiseases. More people die from unsafe water than from all forms of \nviolence, including war. Eighty percent of all sickness in the world is \nattributable to unsafe water and improper sanitation, and they go \ntogether in most instances.\n  These statistics are staggering and disturbing because so much of \nthis disease and despair is preventable. That is what the legislation \nis all about. We need greater U.S. and international involvement and a \nmore proactive strategy. In addition, we need to fully fund this \ninitiative and the other water programs currently undertaken by our \nGovernment.\n  I am grateful the majority leader will shortly enter into a colloquy \nwith me that directly addresses the strategy and funding problems. We \nare going to work together. This is bipartisan legislation. The \nmajority leader and I are doing this not for purposes of showing we can \ndo something together, which I think is an important message, but we \nare actually going to do something. We are going to do more than \nintroduce this legislation. There is going to be more than authorizing \nlegislation. We have a huge budget in the United States. I think we can \nfind money to actually do this. It is important. And we do not have to \ntake from other programs. I hope that is the case.\n  So I look forward to continuing to work with the majority leader, \nSenator Leahy, and Senator McConnell, who are the ranking member and \nchair of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Foreign Operations, and, of \ncourse, Senators Lugar and Biden, who are the chair and ranking member \nof the Foreign Relations Committee. There are others. But we are going \nto get working to make sure we do something positive to make sure the \nworld is a safer place.\n  When people are healthy, they have less problems with raising their \nchildren properly. It creates all across the world an influence that is \npositive and resolves many differences. We know, as is pointed out in \nthe book by Senator Simon, in the future, wars are going to be fought \nover water, not over territorial boundaries necessarily, unless it does \ninvolve water. There is a shortage of water.\n  If we can do some good work in the Middle East, for example, with \nwater--and here, I have to compliment Israel. Israel, as we speak, does \nnot have the best relations with some of its neighbors, but they have \njoint water projects that they are working on. There is not a lot of \nfanfare for that, but they all realize that water is important, as we \ndo.\n  So again, I compliment and I applaud the majority leader for his \ninitiative. I look forward with anticipation to doing something good \nfor millions and even billions of people around the world.\n  Mr. FRIST. I am pleased to enter into this colloquy with the \ndistinguished minority leader and I appreciate his cosponsorship of the \nCurrency for Peace Act of 2005.\n  Mr. REID. I am grateful to the majority leader for raising the \ncritical issue of the lack of safe water in developing countries. It is \none of the world's most pressing development challenges which impacts \nhundreds of millions of people across the globe.\n  Mr. FRIST. Unsafe water and water-related diseases have far reaching \nconsequences. That is why U.S. Government, acting through the \nDepartment of State and the United States Agency for International \nDevelopment, has been undertaking critically important programs in \ndeveloping countries to provide clean and safe water, sanitation and \nhygiene for many years. These life-saving programs should be continued \nand expanded, wherever possible.\n  Mr. REID. It is also critical for the United States and the \ninternational community to fully recognize the role that unsafe water \nplays in causing death, disease, poverty, environmental degradation, \nand instability. An aggressive and timely response is required, and the \nUnited States should be at the forefront of that effort. The U.S. \nGovernment and other donor nations must develop a more proactive \nresponse that commits greater resources and ensures that these \nresources are allocated where the greatest needs exist.\n  Mr. FRIST. And while we bolster and enhance our existing programs and\n\n[[Page S1888]]\n\nstrategies, Senator Reid and I are pleased to put forward this new \ninitiative that fully acknowledges the role that safe water plays in \nhealth and development. In the future, we must find the additional \nresources to fully fund the Safe Water Act of 2005, without decreasing \nour support for existing safe water and other foreign assistance \nprograms.\n  Mr. REID. I fully agree that the initiatives set forth in this act \nshould be fully funded, but not with funds taken from existing and \nongoing foreign assistance programs. I look forward to working with \nSenator Frist and the White House to obtain full funding for this \nprogram in the President's fiscal year 2007 budget and in subsequent \nyears so the United States can implement pilot programs that can \neventually be expanded to other countries in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/02/senate-section/article/S1888-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1888]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Without being presumptuous, in \nmy judgment, I think it was one of his best, maybe his finest, and in \nthe years to come, I hope he can parallel the achievements of this \nparticular trip.\n  My views are important, perhaps, but more important are the views of \nthe representatives from nations in Europe to the United States. I had \nseveral of the ambassadors visit in my office this week to discuss the \nPresident's trip.\n  I would like to read some quotes from television programs on which \nthese three ambassadors appeared recently. Jean-David Levitte is \nFrance's Ambassador, and I have had a particularly warm and productive \nrelationship with this ambassador since he was posted. He has had an \nextraordinary career. He has been here in Washington a number of times \nin previous positions.\n  It is well known he is very close to President Chirac. When asked a \nquestion about the relationship between our country in the context of \nthe President's trip, he said as follows:\n\n       Yes, I do think so. Wolf, I participated--I was privileged \n     to participate in the dinner in Brussels between the two \n     Presidents, and it worked very well.\n\n  That is his appraisal.\n  Then Wolfgang Ischinger, Germany's Ambassador, when asked the \nquestion, Has the relationship, based on what you know, Mr. Ambassador, \nimproved? he replied:\n\n       Oh, I certainly think so, Wolf. In fact, I don't really \n     think we really needed the meeting in minds, President Bush's \n     visit to Germany this past week, to improve this relationship \n     between the two governments. I think we've been doing quite \n     well over the last year already.\n\n  He continued when pressed again:\n\n       I think there has also been substantive movement and \n     change, not only because President Bush, by visiting the \n     European Commission, put to rest the suspicions in this \n     country and in Europe that America might no longer be \n     supportive of the European Union, of the idea of European \n     integration, but also because in the meeting with the German \n     side, in which I had the chance of participating, President \n     Bush, I believe, enhanced the degree of U.S. support. He went \n     a step further in terms of expressing his support for \n     European efforts on Iran.\n\n  Then Sir David Manning of Great Britain. I have had a warm and \nproductive relationship through the years with this fine individual, \nanother individual who has been posted to this country on a number of \noccasions. When asked a similar question about the President's trip, he \nreplied:\n\n       Well, I think we're all very encouraged by the President's \n     visit and, indeed, by Secretary Rice's visit, because this \n     has been an issue that's been discussed by all our heads of \n     government, and much more widely than the three of us here.\n\n  The point I make is, as I read through the press reports from these \nthree ambassadors in the United States, they were all very strong on \nthe issue of the success of the President's visit, together with our \ndistinguished Secretary of State.\n  Then to another subject that President Bush quite properly raised, it \nis one of concern to this Senator and I think a number of us here in \nthe Senate. I would like to quote from the President on his trip. He \nsaid as follows:\n\n       Well, I talked about this issue with President Chirac last \n     night, and Prime Minister Blair.\n\n  The issue, if I might step back, is:\n\n       Mr. President, European countries are talking about lifting \n     their 15-year arms embargo on China. What would be the \n     consequences of that? And could it be done in a way that \n     would satisfy your concerns?\n\n  The President replied:\n\n       Well, I talked about this issue with President Chirac last \n     night, and Prime Minister Blair, and I intend to talk about \n     it in a couple of hours at the European Union meeting. We \n     didn't discuss the issue at NATO, by the way. And here's what \n     I explained. I said there is deep concern in our country that \n     a transfer of weapons would be a transfer of technology to \n     China, which would change the balance of relations between \n     China and Taiwan, and that's of concern. And they, to a \n     person, said, well, they think they can develop a protocol \n     that isn't--that shouldn't concern the United States. And I \n     said I'm looking forward to seeing it. . . .\n\n  Referring to the protocol.\n  I discussed this with several ambassadors when they came into my \noffice and, indeed, a team is to be forthcoming from the European \nnations to visit the United States. I think we should hold final \njudgment until we have had the opportunity, in a courteous way, to \nreflect on those precautions that the European countries will take in \nthe context of lifting this ban.\n\n  But I point out that in my study of the relationship between China \nand not only the United States and Taiwan but the entire region, they \nare on a very fast pace to modernize a wide array of weapons--weapons \nthat could, for the first time, begin to pose in the outyears a threat \nto our fleet units.\n  I select the fleet units because our concept of the projection of our \nforce forward is dependent on the protection of naval components, \nparticularly our carriers. I see on the horizon grave concerns about \nlifting this embargo in terms of China's capability militarily in the \noutyears.\n  A third subject I would like to cover in the context of the \nPresident's visit is he was addressing the challenge to, indeed, all \nfree nations as we participate to try and give support to Israel and \nthe Palestine Government to come to a final consensus to resolve their \nproblems and to bring about a cessation of the turmoil in that region.\n  I am so deeply grateful the President made the following statement:\n\n       President Bush on his recent trip to Europe stated, \n     ``America and Europe have made a moral commitment. We will \n     not stand by as another generation in the Holy Land grows up \n     in an atmosphere of violence and hopelessness.''\n\n  Yesterday, the Armed Services Committee had a hearing. General Jones, \nthe NATO Commander, was on the stand. I questioned him regarding a \nconcept which General Jones and I have discussed on a number of \noccasions over the past several years, and that is the possibility of \nNATO playing a role of peacekeeping on behalf of the Palestinian and \nIsraeli interests. That would have to be at the invitation of both of \nthose Governments.\n  Why NATO? Our country is very proud of a very long relationship with\n\n[[Page S1889]]\n\nthe State of Israel, an island of democracy in that part of the world. \nWe have very strong ties there, as we should. Correspondingly, Europe \nhas had very strong ties with the Palestinian people through the years. \nIt goes way back. Significant portions of their population have ties to \nthat region. So a NATO peacekeeping force comprised of both the \nmilitary units from the European nations and some, I would say, \nproportionate amount of American forces would be perceived as a \nbalanced force and could come, in my judgment, and provide a sense of \nsecurity to support such frameworks of peace and accords as these two \nnations could hopefully achieve with our help and the help of other \nnations.\n  Again, it would only be at the invitation of the two Governments, but \nI think it is a concept that I have addressed on this floor many times. \nOthers have likewise; indeed, some prominent journalists whom I \nrespect. I do hope that it be given consideration.\n  General Jones in his testimony yesterday said it has been brought up \nin the North Atlantic Council of recent. Other nations are interested \nin this concept, and I hope our Nation, the United States, can get \nbehind and explore the options.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator from Kentucky.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I, along with others, had an \nopportunity yesterday to get a briefing from the President about his \ntrip to Europe. It was a bipartisan group, well attended, and everyone \nwas quite interested in getting the President's views of the results of \nhis trip.\n  It is clear that the Iraqi election has transformed the political \nlandscape, not only in the Middle East but in Europe as well.\n  First in the Middle East, we have witnessed in the last few months \nthe election in Afghanistan on October 9, the election in the \nPalestinian territories on January 9. We have witnessed the Rose \nrevolution up in Georgia, the Orange revolution in Ukraine. Then we \nhave had the election in Iraq. And in the post-Iraq period, we have \nseen people take to the streets in Lebanon.\n  It is clear with the unified message from the French and the \nAmericans that the international community wants, at long last, Syrian \ntroops out of Lebanon--entirely out, not just the troops but the \nsecurity forces as well--so that the Lebanese elections this spring can \nbe uninhibited by foreigners.\n  All of this is going on, and added to that we have the President of \nEgypt saying they are going to have a real election. That has certainly \nnot been the case in Egypt in the past. A real election presumably \nmeans real choices with the opposition allowed to speak, participate, \nand run for office.\n  We have even seen some elections in Saudi Arabia, though women are \nnot yet allowed to vote. That is a step obviously in the right \ndirection.\n  What is happening here? I think the Iraqi policy of the President of \nthe United States is transforming the Middle East and transforming \nEuropean attitudes toward America and the policy in the Middle East. \nThe President's trip last week I think underscores that.\n  He had unanimous support from NATO, all 26 countries, to do something \nwithin their capability to help the Iraqi emerging democracy. The \nFrench want to help. The Germans want to help. This is an enormous \ntransformation in Europe, as well as in the Middle East. All of this, I \nwould argue, is a result of the extraordinarily effective war on terror \nand particularly the Afghanistan and Iraqi chapters.\n  The President's grand strategy is not just to protect us at home--and \nthat has worked so far; since 9/11 they have not been able to hit us \nagain--but through these policies of transformation, he sort of drained \nthe swamp and made it likely that the kinds of people who tend to join \nup with these terrorist groups will feel a sense of hopelessness in \ntheir own countries because they do not have a chance to influence \noutcomes and determine their own governments and their own fates.\n  This is an incredible step in the right direction. Clearly, problems \nremain, and at the top of the list would have to be Iran and North \nKorea. With regard to Iran, the President is pursuing a multilateral \npolicy in which the British, the Germans, and the French engage the \nIranians, hoping to convince them to follow the policy chosen by \nMuammar Qadhafi, for example, in Libya, witnessing what happened to \nSaddam Hussein in Iraq, deciding it would be better to give up weapons \nof mass destruction and work his way back toward being part of the \ncommunity of civilized nations. The Europeans hopefully will make that \npoint to the Iranians, and we are looking forward to pursuing a very \naggressive policy. Everyone in Europe agrees that a nuclear Iran is \nsimply not an option.\n  While we do have growing areas of agreement with our European allies, \nthere are some differences. As the Senator from Virginia pointed out, \nwe are not happy about the apparent decision of the European community \nto trade with China in possibly missile technology or other military \nequipment that could potentially destabilize Asia and raise the anxiety \nof the Japanese, for example, and ourselves and exacerbate the cross-\nstraits problem between China and Taiwan. So we do have our differences \nwith the Europeans on that.\n  The President made it clear that in addition to the public meetings \nhe had with President Putin of Russia, privately he also aggressively \nemphasized the importance of Russia continuing in a democratic \ndirection and the importance of not unraveling the democratic reforms \nof the early 1990s if Russia is going to be a place where foreign \ninvestment will be willing to go. If there is not a respect for the \nrule of law and not a free press, not the kind of atmosphere in which \none can function, the chances of Russia realizing its aspirations will \nbe significantly set back if President Putin continues down the path he \nhas chosen.\n  The new Ukrainian President was there. It was very exciting for all \nof the 26 NATO members to have an opportunity to see this hero. His \nopponents tried to kill him, and he is still in the process of trying \nto recover from the poisoning that almost took his life. It was \nremarkable to see the Ukrainian people take to the streets and demand \nan honest election, get an honest election, and elect someone who is \nwestward leaning and who wants to bring the Ukraine into the European \ncommunity and make it a country that can advance the hopes, desires, \nand aspirations of the Ukrainian people.\n  Finally, the President indicated he had an extraordinary, uplifting \nexperience in Slovakia. He said he was standing there in the square \nspeaking to the Slovakian people, and he said the best evidence that \nthey have a genuine democracy was that one fellow had a sign up with \nsome kind of anti-Bush comment on the sign. The President said the man \nstood there quietly holding up his sign during all of the President's \nspeech, and the President pointed out that that was a further \nillustration that in Slovakia they are free to speak their mind and \npeacefully protest. The President thought that was a good sign of the \nstability and effectiveness of the new Slovakian democracy. By the way, \nthat is a country that is making remarkable progress, which is, I am \nsure, the reason the President chose to go there.\n\n  I conclude by saying that President Bush clearly had a good week, and \nthe reason he had a good week is because he has been pursuing policies \nthat are working. Democracy is breaking out, springing up, taking root \nall through the Middle East, and the Europeans look at that and have to \nconclude that whether or not they supported the Iraq war initially, \nthat single decision to liberate Iraq could well be the turning\n\n[[Page S1890]]\n\npoint in transforming the Middle East into a place where democracies \nthat respect the rights of minorities, engage in protection of human \nrights, and have free presses are the wave of the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask that the Chair let me know when I \nhave 6 minutes remaining on our time, please.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will so inform the Senator.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. President, President Bush has recently concluded an \nhistoric and highly productive trip to Europe. During my review of what \nwas said, and more importantly, what was accomplished, I was struck by \nthe number of significant issues that were addressed and how so many of \nthem portend a better future for our important transatlantic \nrelationship. This was a ``good news'' trip, which might explain why \nits coverage in the U.S. media was minimal at best.\n  There is no doubt that relations between the United States and Europe \nhave been strained, especially over the conflict to liberate the people \nof Iraq. And, as we know, the media seems to thrive on reporting bad \nnews at the expense of the good, which can distort what actually \nexists.\n  I know, for example, that reading about the situation in Iraq in the \npress forms one perception of reality. But, one gets a very different \npoint of view if they visit Iraq and meet with our military personnel \nwho are serving there, as I was able to do recently. One would think \nthat they are talking about two completely different countries. The \nfact is that Iraq is not all doom and gloom, nor is it yet the place we \nenvision it to become.\n  It is evolving politically, economically, socially, and yes, it is \nfacing significant challenges from insurgents and terrorists. Yet, \nthanks to the vision and fortitude of President Bush, the extraordinary \nmen and women in our military and diplomatic service, and the Iraqi \npeople, Iraq is becoming a more secure country working toward its own \nunique form of representative government.\n  In Europe, it is my firm belief that we have far more in common than \nwe have differences over foreign policy. Again, the media has tended to \nfocus its reporting on the problems between us, which distorts the \nreality of our relationship with Europe. And, what is that reality? \nWhat are the issues? And, how do we see the transatlantic alliance in \nthe future?\n  I come to this issue without any ``rose colored'' glasses. As a \ncongressional delegate to the WorId Economic Conference in Davos, \nSwitzerland, last January, I experienced first-hand the depth of \nresentment toward the United States felt by many Europeans. But on that \nsame trip, in a meeting with French President Chirac, I also saw the \nbeginning of the end of this feeling.\n  We have a vision for Iraq and the Middle East in general that calls \nfor individual freedom and representative government. I do not think \nthat the French, or any other democratic, European nation was opposed \nto this ``vision.'' Rather, they were skeptical that President Bush \ncould actually move his vision of freedom to becoming a reality in an \narea of the world pretty much devoid of democratic governments, with a \nfew exceptions like Israel and Turkey.\n  In our meeting with President Chirac it was clear that he saw that \nUnited States polices in Iraq are beginning to work, that freedom might \nreally take root in the Middle East, and that France and the rest of \nEurope had to be a part of this historic process.\n  By working together with European leaders, President Bush has put our \ntransatlantic alliance and relations with Europe back on a normal \ntrack. We came to agreement on some issues, agreed to work on others, \nand identified those where we differ.\n  The list of results and issues addressed by President Bush during his \ntrip is impressive and I want to highlight some of the major ones that \nfall into several categories:\n  First, with respect to NATO, all 26 member counties have now agreed \nto provide some form of assistance to support the NATO mission of \ntraining Iraqi defense forces.\n  With regard to Afghanistan, NATO continues to expand its role as the \nleader of the International Security Assistance Force, ISAF, and the \nUnited States and NATO agreed to work toward merging the United States-\nled Operation Enduring Freedom and ISAF into one allied command.\n  With regard to Ukraine, strong support was expressed by NATO \nSecretary General de Hoop Scheffer and President Bush for the future \naccession of Ukraine into NATO.\n  With regard to the E.U., the United States and the E.U. issued a \njoint statement in support of the people and the Government of Iraq.\n  United States concerns were clearly expressed to the E.U. about \nlifting its arms embargo against China.\n  President Chirac understands these concerns and there will be more \nUnited States and E.U. discussions on the embargo.\n  The United States and Germany announced joint actions on cleaner and \nmore efficient energy policies and on climate change, which will \ninclude: Joint activities to develop and deploy cleaner, more efficient \nenergy technologies; Cooperation in advancing climate science; and \njoint action to address air-pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.\n  With regard to Iran, the United States and its European allies \nexchanged views on nuclear weapons in Iran and agreed to that it is not \nin the world's interest and that a common approach on this issue should \nbe developed.\n  The United States agreed to take a more proactive role in the \nEuropean-led negotiations with Iran on its nuclear program.\n  With regard to Russia, President Bush made clear to President Putin \nthe importance of promoting democracy in Russia.\n  Both presidents announced cooperation in combating the spread of man-\nportable air-defense systems or MANPADS.\n  Both agreed that Iran and North Korea should not have nuclear \nweapons.\n  Both voiced strong support for a peace agreement between Israel and \nPalestine.\n  Presidents Bush and Putin announced six areas, called the Bratislava \ninitiatives, designed to bring Russia and the United States closer \ntogether. These initiatives are: nuclear security cooperation, World \nTrade Organization, energy cooperation, counterterrorism, space \ncooperation, and humanitarian, social, and people-to-people programs\n  With regard to Lebanon, President Bush and President Chirac jointly \nannounced their condemnation on the assassination of former Lebanese \nPrime Minster Rafiq Hariri and pledged their mutual support for a free, \nindependent, and democratic Lebanon.\n  I began my remarks by stating that President Bush's European trip was \nhistoric and productive. The partial list of issues I just mentioned \nclearly shows how much President Bush and European leaders have moved \nbeyond policy differences over Iraq and that we share a common vision \nfor a peaceful, democratic world. We may not always agree on how to \nreach our objectives, but we can agree on what those objectives are.\n  Our remaining challenge to further strengthen our ties with Europe is \nto change the negative perception that many average Europeans have of \nthe United States. This is where the media can, and should, play a \nconstructive role by balanced reporting on the true state of our \nrelationship with Europe.\n  Let me repeat that we have far more in common with Europe than the \ndifferences between us and President Bush made great strides in \npromoting our common vision of the world with our allies.\n  It is now up to the rest of us to reinforce the President's message \nof working with our European allies, just as it is up to the Europeans \nto understand that President Bush's goal of promoting freedom around \nthe world is a perpetual one that is in all mankind's interest to \npromote.\n  I close by commenting on some statements that were made yesterday in \na hearing. In the Senate Armed Services Committee, under the leadership \nof Senator John Warner and Senator Carl Levin, we had General Jones, \nGeneral Abizaid, and General Brown, who represent the commands \nresponsible for the Iraqi conflict. In his opening statement, General \nAbizaid made the comment that as a result of what\n\n[[Page S1891]]\n\nhas happened in Iraq, in Operation Iraqi Freedom, and Afghanistan, we \nhave now seen free and open elections in Afghanistan, and we have seen \nfree and open elections in Iraq. We have seen an election take place in \nSaudi Arabia that were it not for the conflict in Iraq would never have \nhappened. We have seen the people in Lebanon rise up against their \nSyrian invaders and put pressure on the Syrian Government to return \nthat country to the people of Lebanon.\n  We have seen the Government of Libya turn over their nuclear weapons \nto the IAEA and to the United States for examination, to rid their \ncountry of the potential to have any nuclear weapons.\n  We have seen the leader of Egypt now proclaim he wants to see \ndemocratic elections in his country for the first time.\n  There are any number of instances that have occurred and are going to \noccur in the Middle East, a part of the world where violence has \nprevailed for decades, and where the terrorist community has trained \nand perpetuated itself for decades. Were it not for the vision of \nPresident Bush relative to the freedom of the Iraqi people, were it not \nfor the support of Congress and the American people of that vision, and \nwere it not for the strong leadership of our military, the strongest, \ngreatest fighting force in the world, those events General Abizaid \nticked off yesterday simply would not have happened.\n  If he had come in 12 months ago and said here is what is going to \nhappen in the Middle East over the next year, no one would ever have \nbelieved that what he said would come to be true. The fact is it did. \nThe fact is the people of Iraq are moving toward freedom and democracy. \nThe fact is that now, after President Bush's highly successful trip to \nEurope, the Europeans have a better understanding of the importance of \nthe transatlantic alliance working together to promote our president's \nvision of freedom throughout the world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I will take the remaining time on the \nRepublican side. I thank my colleagues, Senator Warner, Senator \nMcConnell, and Senator Chambliss, for laying out the leadership our \nPresident has shown in going overseas, talking about our fight for \nfreedom, and showing it is a fight for freedom for every country that \nhas a democracy, and that it should also be a shared responsibility.\n  I appreciate the President's leadership and our Senators for talking \nabout what is happening. It is incredible, the changes we are seeing in \nthe world because of the President's steadfast determination that we \nare going to do the right thing, that America will be the banner of \nfreedom throughout the world, and that we could use help from our \nallies and hopefully they will understand and agree it is a shared \nresponsibility for all the freedom-loving peoples of the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/02/senate-section/article/S1891-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1891-S1892]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TEXAS INDEPENDENCE DAY\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to take a moment, as I do on \nMarch 2 every year since I have been in the Senate, and before me \nSenator John Tower did the same thing, to commemorate Texas \nIndependence Day.\n  Today is, indeed, the 169th anniversary of the day when a solemn \nconvention of 54 men in a small Texas settlement took a step which had \na momentous impact, not only on Texas but on the future of the United \nStates. These 54 men, including my great-great-grandfather Charles S. \nTaylor from the town of Nacogdoches, met on March 2, 1836. They were in \nWashington-on-the-Brazos and, after laying out the grievances they had \nwith the Government of Mexico, they declared:\n\n       We therefore . . . do hereby resolve and declare . . . that \n     the people of Texas do now constitute a free, sovereign and \n     independent republic.\n\n  They brought the Lone Star Republic into existence with those words. \nAt the time, Texas was a remote territory of Mexico. It was hospitable \nonly to the bravest and most determined of settlers. While few of the \nmen signing the declaration could have predicted Texas's future \nprosperity, they immediately embarked on drafting a constitution to \nestablish foundations for this new republic.\n  The signers of the Texas declaration, as their forefathers who signed \nthe American Declaration of Independence in 1776, risked their lives \nand families when they put pen to paper. They were considered traitors \nto Mexico because they were in a Mexican territory. But they were going \nto fight for freedom and independence.\n  My great-great-grandfather Charles S. Taylor didn't know it at the \ntime, but all four of his children had died when he left home to go and \nsign the declaration of independence. His wife took the children in \nwhat is now called the ``runaway scrape,'' when the women in the \nNacogdoches territory took the children to flee from what they thought \nmight be the oncoming Mexican army. In the ``runaway scrape,'' many \nchildren died. They were fleeing to Louisiana at the time. But my \ngreat-great-grandmother had the same spunk and determination as my \ngreat-great-grandfather, so she returned to Nacogdoches and they had \nnine more children. That was one of the examples that was set by people \nof that time who believed freedom was worth fighting and dying to \nachieve.\n  They spent their last days in Texas, trying to build the Republic and \neventually supporting the statehood of Texas coming into the United \nStates of America.\n  While the convention met in Washington-on-the-Brazos, 6,000 Mexican \ntroops held the Alamo under siege, seeking to extinguish this newly \ncreated republic.\n  Several days earlier, from the Alamo, Col. William Barrett Travis \nsent his immortal letter to the people of Texas and to all Americans. \nHe knew the Mexican Army was approaching and he knew that he had, \nreally only a few men, under 200 men to help defend the San Antonio \nfortress. Colonel Travis wrote:\n\n       Fellow Citizens and Compatriots: I am besieged with a \n     thousand or more of the Mexicans under Santa Anna. I have \n     sustained a continual Bombardment and cannonade for 24 hours \n     and have not lost a man. The enemy has demanded surrender at \n     discretion, otherwise, the garrison is to be put to the \n     sword, if the fort is taken. I have answered the demand with \n     a cannon shot, and our flag still waves proudly over the \n     wall. I shall never surrender or retreat.\n       Then I call on you in the name of Liberty, of patriotism, \n     of everything dear to the American character, to come to our \n     aid with all dispatch. The enemy is receiving reinforcements \n     daily and will no doubt increase to three or four thousand in \n     four or five days. If this call is neglected I am determined \n     to sustain myself as long as possible and die like a soldier \n     who never forgets what is due his honor and that of his \n     country--Victory or Death.\n\n  No Texan--no person--can fail to be stirred by Colonel Travis' \nresolve in the face of such daunting odds.\n  Colonel Travis' dire prediction came true, 4,000 to 6,000 Mexican \ntroops did lay siege to the Alamo. In the battle that followed, 184 \nbrave men died in a heroic but vain attempt to fend off Santa Anna's \noverwhelming army. This battle, as all Texans know, was crucial to \nTexas independence because those heroes at the Alamo held out for so \nlong that Santa Anna's forces were battered and diminished. Gen. Sam \nHouston gained the time he needed to devise a strategy to defeat Santa \nAnna at the Battle of San Jacinto a month or so later on April 21, \n1836. That battle was won and the Lone Star was visible on the horizon \nat last.\n  Each year on March 2, there is a ceremony at Washington-on-the-Brazos \nState Park where there is a replica of the modest cabin where the 54 \npatriots pledged their lives, honor, and treasure for freedom.\n  Every year I honor the tradition Senator John Tower started by \nreading this incredible letter from the Alamo, written by William \nBarrett Travis, that showed so much about the kind of men who were \nwilling to stand up and fight for freedom, men we have seen throughout \nthe history of our country, starting in 1776 and going on. Even today, \nas we know, our young men are in Iraq and Afghanistan, fighting the war \non terrorism.\n  I think it is important for us to remember our history. I am proud to \nbe able to do it. We were a republic for 10 years before we entered the \nUnited States as a State. We are the only State to enter the United \nStates as a republic, and we are very proud that we are now a great \nState, a part of the\n\n[[Page S1892]]\n\nUnited States of America, with a vivid history and past.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of S. 256, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 256) to amend title 11 of the United States \n     Code, and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n  Feingold Amendment No. 17, to provide a homestead floor for the \nelderly.\n  Akaka Amendment No. 15, to require enhanced disclosure to consumers \nregarding the consequences of making only minimum required payments in \nthe repayment of credit card debt.\n  Leahy Amendment No. 26, to restrict access to certain personal \ninformation in bankruptcy documents.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 20 \nminutes of debate, equally divided, prior to a vote on amendment No. \n17.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I appreciate this opportunity to speak \nfurther on my amendment which I offered yesterday. I urge my colleagues \nto support my senior homeowner protection amendment, amendment No. 17.\n\n  As I explained yesterday, my amendment would protect senior \nhomeowners who need to file for bankruptcy relief. It would help to \nensure that these older Americans do not have to lose their hard-earned \nhomes in order to seek the protection of the bankruptcy system.\n  The homestead exemption in the bankruptcy laws is supposed to protect \nhomeowners from having to give up their homes in order to seek \nbankruptcy relief. But in too many States, the homestead exemption is \nwoefully inadequate. The value of this exemption varies widely from \nState to State. Federal law currently creates an alternative homestead \nexemption of just under $20,000, but each State gets to decide whether \nit will allow its debtors to rely on this already low Federal \nalternative, and most do not. In many States, the amount of equity a \nhomeowner can protect in bankruptcy has lagged far behind the dramatic \nrise in home values in recent years. For example, in the State of Ohio \nthe homestead exemption is only $5,000, and in the State of North \nCarolina the homestead exemption is a mere $10,000. Even for States \nthat have no State exemption but allow debtors to use the $20,000 \nFederal exemption, like New Jersey, the number is just too low in this \nage of rising housing costs.\n  My amendment would create a uniform Federal floor for homestead \nexemptions of $75,000, applicable only to bankruptcy debtors over the \nage of 62. States could no longer impose lower exemptions on their \nseniors. If a State's exemption is higher than $75,000, however, that \nexemption would still apply. My amendment creates a floor, not a \nceiling.\n  Older Americans desperately need this protection. Americans over the \nage of 65 are the fastest-growing age group filing for bankruptcy \nprotection. Job loss, medical expenses and other crises are wreaking \nhavoc on the finances of our seniors. In the 1990s, the number of \nAmericans 65 and older filing for bankruptcy tripled. They need our \nhelp.\n  Older Americans also are far more likely to have paid off their \nmortgages over decades of hard work, making the homestead exemption \nparticularly important for them. In fact, more than 70 percent of \nhomeowners age 65 and older own their homes free and clear. For these \nseniors, their home equity often represents nearly their entire life \nsavings, and their home is often their only significant asset. That \nmeans seniors are hit hardest by the very low homestead exemptions in \nsome states.\n  It has become apparent that when there is no substantive argument \nagainst a worthy amendment, we will hear arguments cautioning against \nthe unraveling of delicate compromises and agreements. It has become a \nconvenient and frequent refrain on the floor of the Senate, that \namendments cannot be tolerated. That is very troubling, particularly \nbecause in the Judiciary Committee we were implored to hold our \namendments for the floor and promised that supporters of the bill would \nwork with us to try to resolve our concerns. There is a bait and switch \ngoing on here. Bills that come before this body are not sacrosanct. If \nthere is a substantive argument to be made against my amendment, I am \neager to hear it and debate it. But it is just not right to say that an \namendment will be defeated because the bill must remain ``clean'' to \npass.\n  It is especially wrong to make that argument when it is just not \ntrue. Some amendments might be termed poison pills, but that term does \nnot apply to this amendment.\n  To be frank, my amendment simply has no bearing whatsoever on the \nother provision of the bill that addresses the homestead exemption--\nthat is, the provision whose delicate balance we have been so strongly \ncautioned not to disrupt.\n  Section 322 of the bill addresses abuses resulting from the fact that \nsome States have unlimited homestead exemptions. An agreement on that \nprovision--often called the Kohl amendment after my senior colleague \nfrom Wisconsin, who led the fight against these abuses--was reached in \nthe 2002 conference. Senators from the States that had unlimited \nhomestead exemptions, such as Florida and Texas, objected strenuously \nto a Federal ceiling preempting their States' unlimited exemptions. \nThey agreed to the provision only when it was modified to its current \nversion, in which the Federal cap applies only to people engaging in \nfraud and people who purchase property shortly before filing for \nbankruptcy.\n  My amendment has no bearing whatsoever on that compromise deal. The \nSenators who initially objected to Senator Kohl's attempt to limit \nwealthy debtors' abuse of the homestead exemption are from States where \nthe homestead exemption is already unlimited. In those States, my \nuniform Federal floor would have absolutely no effect. The unlimited \nexemption would still apply.\n  On the other side of the negotiations were people like Senator Kohl \nwho were attempting to prevent wealthy debtors from abusing the \nhomestead exemption by buying multi-million dollar mansions in States \nwith unlimited homestead exemptions. I have not heard them object to \ngiving seniors a uniform homestead exemption that is less than the \nFederal ceiling provided in Section 322. Once again, my amendment has \nabsolutely no effect on the deal that was cut.\n  I would also point out that supporters of the bill are perfectly \nwilling to override State decisions with regard to homestead exemptions \nin certain circumstances. This bill already requires that a Federal \nmaximum exemption apply to prevent abuse by wealthy debtors seeking to \nhide their assets in a mansion and get rid of their debts through \nbankruptcy. Why can't we insist on a Federal floor to protect senior \ncitizens? It makes no sense to suggest that this amendment violates \nState prerogatives on the homestead exemption since the bill already \ndoes just that.\n  So I am having a hard time figuring out who would object to my \namendment, and what delicate compromise is going to be undone if my \namendment passes. Is anyone going to stand on the floor of the Senate \nand defend the right of States to harm the elderly by forcing them to \nsell their homes in order to seek bankruptcy protection? Are we really \ngoing to take the States rights argument that far?\n  So my amendment has nothing to do with compromises already made in \nthis bill. It would not unravel the bill, or upset the compromise on \nthe homestead exemption. Now the credit card companies probably don't \nlike this amendment because it will protect\n\n[[Page S1893]]\n\nsome seniors from having to sell their homes to pay their debts. Once \nagain, the Senate has a choice to make. Will we stand with our senior \ncitizens or with the credit card companies and big banks?\n  I also want to explain a bit more why I have limited the amendment to \ndebtors age 62 and over. The argument was made yesterday by the Senator \nfrom Alabama that a single mother or a young family also would benefit \nfrom a larger exemption. But seniors are the people who need the \nexemption most. Most people in their 20s and 30s do not have $75,000 of \nequity in their homes, if they own homes at all. Certainly those who \nare filing for bankruptcy do not. Seniors, on the other hand, have \nworked their whole lives to payoff their mortgages and guarantee \nthemselves a comfortable place to live in their retirement. They \nsurvive on their modest social security benefits precisely because they \nhave no mortgage or rental payments. Are we now going to force them to \nforfeit their homes because they face such high medical expenses that \nthey have to seek bankruptcy protection?\n  In addition seniors are typically living on fixed incomes and simply \ndon't have the ability to rebuild wealth that younger people have. Nor \ncan they afford to make payments on a new mortgage. If forced to sell \ntheir homes, many older Americans will not be able to afford to rent a \nhabitable, safe place to live. Some can barely afford to the pay the \nproperty taxes on their current paid-off homes because of rising real \nestate assessments.\n  We need to protect our senior citizens in their retirement years. I \nstrongly urge my colleagues to vote for my amendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the Feingold \namendment. I explained yesterday why I oppose this provision and would \nlike to summarize my remarks today.\n\n  First off, I commend Senator Feingold's commitment to the elderly. He \nis very sincere in his efforts. We all are concerned about our senior \ncitizens.\n  I have worked particularly hard on this bill to make sure there are \nprovisions that protect the elderly along with women and children and I \nthink that my colleagues who have worked with me on this bill recognize \nthis fact. We have lots of protections in this bill.\n  Senator Grassley is the lead sponsor of this bill and he has a long \ntrack record of working with the elderly on Social Security and \nMedicare and other issues, as I do. I serve on the Finance Committee \nwith Senator Grassley, who chairs that committee. We were both proud to \nhave played a role in bringing prescription drug coverage to our \nseniors under the Medicare program in the landmark medicare reform bill \nthat was enacted last Congress.\n  My opposition to this amendment has nothing to do with the elderly. I \nbelieve that this bill takes their concerns to heart.\n  I would not object if every State in the Nation passed laws that \nwould put a similar floor--or a higher floor--in their respective \nhomestead laws. But that choice belongs to the States, and not the \nFederal Government. There is a long history in bankruptcy law of \ndeference to States on issues like homestead provisions.\n  The hard reality is that nearly every State in the country has \nvehemently defended their homestead laws. If you do not believe me you \ncan ask the Senators from States like Texas, Florida, and Kansas. They \nhave all been involved in reaching the compromise that has been \nachieved in this legislation on this issue over the past 8 years.\n  It is a grand compromise that both sides of the Hill will accept if \nwe vote down the Feingold amendment. The Feingold amendment would bring \nthe bill down.\n  If some States wish to change their laws, that is their prerogative. \nA key purpose of this bill, and the purpose of the current homestead \nprovisions, is to curb fraud and abuse.\n  The provisions of S. 256 impose a 10-year look back for fraud. They \nimpose a 2-year residency requirement that is designed to prevent \nwealthy debtors from moving from States with low homestead exemptions \nto States with high or unlimited exemptions and then filing for \nbankruptcy. They are a compromise--a balance--of States' rights and \nFederal imperatives under bankruptcy law, and we must let the \nprovisions stand as written. This amendment will upset that balance and \ncould act to bring this bill down.\n  The reason has nothing to do with a hostility to the elderly, or to \nany other class of persons, but because the homestead provisions have \ntaken years to negotiate and are the result of difficult choices and \ncompromises. There are many members of this body who would like to see \nthe homestead provisions changed in some fashion, but to accommodate \nthem any further than what presently exists in the bill would likely \nforce other Senators to oppose the legislation.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject the Feingold amendment, however well \nintentioned it may be, because this is a grand compromise of a bill \nthat I don't believe the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin has ever \nsupported. The fact of the matter is, if his amendment were agreed to, \nhe would not support this bill. And the reason he would not is because \nhe would not agree to the compromise we have in the bill which the vast \nmajority of Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle in both \nHouses have agreed to.\n  I hope we can vote down the Feingold amendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, first, I want to correct the record. The \nSenator from Utah is incorrect that I never supported a version of the \nbankruptcy bill. I did, in 2002 when there was a vote on the Senate \nfloor. Our late colleague from Minnesota and I used to have a little \ncontest about who was the only one to vote ``no'' on a bill the most. \nThis was a case where Senator Wellstone voted ``no'' and I actually \nvoted ``aye'' for a version--a reasonable, balanced version--of a \nbankruptcy bill when it appeared on one occasion during the past 7 \nyears. Unfortunately, that bill was not accepted and was basically \nrejected out of hand by those in the House who insisted on an \nunbalanced, unfair bill.\n  That is exactly what we have before us today. I reject the argument \nthat this amendment in any way, shape, or form endangers this bill. How \ncan that be the case?\n  The Senator from Utah has said this bill affects States rights with \nregard to the homestead exemption. This bill does affect the rights of \nFlorida and Texas to have an unlimited homestead exemption, as it \nshould. The Federal Government has an interest here in making sure \nwealthy people cannot abuse the system. I support that goal of stopping \nfraud.\n  The Federal Government also has an interest in making sure our senior \ncitizens have absolute minimum protection for their homes when they are \nforced into bankruptcy, particularly because of unanticipated health \ncare costs.\n  I am not creating some new precedent in this bill. This bill already \nchanges state rules on the homestead exemption, and my amendment has \nabsolutely no impact on the delicate balance achieved with regard to \nthe high end of the homestead exemption.\n  This amendment is not intended to harm the bill, and, in fact, it \ndoes not harm the bill. It is simply trying to bring an element of \nfairness and balance to the bankruptcy laws with regard to senior \ncitizens who might lose their homes.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, it is my understanding the distinguished \nSenator from Alabama will have 2 minutes before the Akaka amendment. Is \nthat correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HATCH. He does not need time from my time at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1 minute of debate on the majority \nside.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I would be happy to yield some of my time \nat this point, and then I will have an additional 1 minute immediately \nbefore the vote.\n  Let me answer my dear colleague from Wisconsin. My point is he has \nnever been for this bill. Frankly, he knows this language in this bill \nis the result of tremendous compromise between the House and the \nSenate. His amendment, would bring this bill down. All of us would like \nto make changes. This is a complex bill. I think\n\n[[Page S1894]]\n\nall of us, if we could be dictator for a day, would put our own imprint \non this bill. But this is 8 years of work, and I don't want to see this \nbill brought down because one person doesn't agree with one provision. \nIn the viewpoint of the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin, most of \nthe protections he doesn't agree with. He is not going to vote for this \nbill, whether his amendment is agreed to. All his amendment does is \ncreate a confusion and a situation where literally this bill could go \ndown.\n  We have to get this bill in a form which the House will accept, and \nthis is the form in which the House will accept it.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to the distinguished Senator from \nAlabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n\n                            AMENDMENT NO. 15\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I appreciate the time.\n  I rise in opposition to the upcoming amendment submitted by Senator \nAkaka. The amendment would amend the Truth in Lending Act and impose \nsignificant new compliance mandates and disclosure requirements on \nlenders.\n  This amendment makes considerable changes to an area of law squarely \nwithin the jurisdiction of the Banking Committee which I chair, and I \nhope it will not be included in the bankruptcy bill. This is simply not \na dispute about asserting the Banking Committee's jurisdiction which we \nhave here. The Akaka amendment, if it were agreed to, would be a \nsignificant change to the Truth in Lending Act.\n  This is a highly complex law, and amendments to it, must be \nconsidered carefully, and should be considered in the committee first.\n  I will be glad and happy to work with the distinguished Senator from \nHawaii in that regard. But we have not had an opportunity to look at \nthis, nor to conduct an appropriate examination of the substance \ninvolved in the amendment, and, therefore, there is no record upon \nwhich to base a judgment here with respect to the soundness of the \nprovision. I don't believe this is either the time or the place for \nthis amendment.\n  I will oppose the amendment.\n\n\n                        VOTE ON AMENDMENT NO. 17\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nLincoln be added as a cosponsor of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, S. 256 includes a requirement that credit \ncard issuers provide additional information about the consequences of \nmaking minimum payments. However, this provision fails to provide the \ndetailed information for consumers on their billing statement that our \namendment would provide. Our amendment will make it very clear what \ncosts consumers will incur if they make only minimum payments on their \ncredit cards. If this amendment is adopted, the personalized \ninformation they will receive for each of their accounts on their \nbilling statements will help them make informed choices about payments \nthey choose to make toward reducing their outstanding debts.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment that will empower \nconsumers by providing them with details and personalized information \nto assist them in making better informed choices about their credit \ncard use and repayment. This amendment makes clear the adverse \nconsequences of uninformed choices, such as making only minimum \npayments, and provides opportunities to locate assistance to better \nmanage their credit card debt. I thank my cosponsors, Senators Durbin, \nLeahy, Sarbanes, and Lincoln, for their support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized for 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, this is a very complicated amendment. This \nis in the jurisdiction of the Banking Committee. It deals with the \ntruth in lending law. We have not had any hearings on this issue. I \nwould be glad to work with the Senator from Hawaii. We can sit down and \nsee if we can do something on this issue. To bring it up on the Senate \nfloor and try to make it part of the bankruptcy bill and bypass the \nBanking Committee is something we should not do. I hope we will not.

Madam President, I had the opportunity to talk with our \nfloor leaders. Because my amendments are related, I am prepared to \ndiscuss or debate these issues and to consider them together, if it is \nagreeable with the other side. Then we could enter into a time \nagreement and leave that up to the leadership as to when we might move \nahead and vote on them, hopefully back to back, with a brief interlude \nof, I think, probably 4 minutes evenly divided, so we would have a \nchance later in the day to describe them.\n  I do not offer that as a unanimous consent request at this time. I \njust mention on the floor now that it is my understanding that it will \nbe worked out by the leadership, so Members have some idea as to how we \nare going to proceed.\n  These two amendments relate to the health care challenges so many of \nour fellow citizens are facing in with regard to going into bankruptcy. \nWe know at the present time there are 1.5 million people who go into \nbankruptcy every year. Half of those people go into bankruptcy because \nof medical bills. About three-quarters of those individuals who go into \nbankruptcy because of the medical bills have health insurance, but \nnonetheless the explosion of costs in health care have added such a \nburden to these families that they have had to go into bankruptcy. It \ndoes seem to me if the purpose of this legislation is to try to deal \nwith spendthrifts and those who are abusers of credit, we ought to be \nable to distinguish between hard-working Americans, basically middle-\nclass working families who have health insurance or those right on the \nmargin who wish they had health insurance, who perhaps lost their \nhealth insurance because of a change in their employment, and then \nsuddenly are facing catastrophic health needs, and those who \nirresponsibly acquire debt.\n  What are those types of health needs? We start off with cancer. The \naverage out-of-pocket expenditure, even for families who have \ninsurance, is approximately $35,000. That often is enough to trigger a \nfamily to go into bankruptcy because of the limitations it puts on the \nincome of the families. Often it is one of the breadwinners of the \nfamily who becomes ill, and it is the loss of that breadwinner's \nincome, not only the medical bills, that in frequent instances drives \nthat family into bankruptcy. I will give some examples of why that \nhappens.\n  It does seem to me we should not apply the harsher provisions--and \nthey are harsher provisions, what is called the means test--the harsher \nprovisions that put an additional penalty on those families than \nalready exists in the current bankruptcy law. That effectively is what \none of the amendments addresses.\n  The second amendment says if those families are going to go into \nbankruptcy, then we are going to let them preserve their homestead to \nthe extent of $150,000 of equity in their primary residence through a \nhomestead exemption.\n  The average cost of a house in this country is $240,000. It is vastly \nmore expensive in my part of the country. In Massachusetts the cost of \nhousing is the second highest in the country. In many of the areas in \nthe Northeast, in the coastal areas, and even in the heartland of this \nNation, housing is much more than $150,000.\n  What we are trying to say is that it is hard enough, meeting the \npersonal burdens of illness and sickness and disease--in the case I \njust mentioned in terms of cancer, but those conditions apply as well \nif you have heart disease, stroke, other kinds of serious illness, or \nif you have a child who has serious illness: autism, spina bifida, the \nwhole range of challenges which infants have. More often than not, the \nhealth insurance proposals, most that I have seen, exclude any \ncomplications in the first 10 days of life. That is the time the \nillness or sickness is detected in many of these children, and that is \nwhen the economic spiral down starts.\n  What we are saying in these two amendments is, No. 1, it is difficult \nenough to face the pain and anxiety of a serious medical condition. You \nshould not have the more punitive provisions under the means test. We \ncan go into details about how they would be expected to pay a good deal \nmore from the means test even though under the current law they would \nnot have to. They would have their assets and their liabilities and \nthere would have to be a determination for the payment, what assets \nthey have, and then they could start fresh. Under the means test it \nwould mean further obligations for the next 5 years, and the real \nquestion is how some of these individuals would be able to survive and, \nsecondly, to say these families face a serious enough problem and they \nshould not lose a home where they have equity of $150,000 or less.\n\n[[Page S1896]]\n\n  There will be those who say this bill is not about our health care \nsystem, which has its good points and has its bad points. We are not \ndebating that today. We ought to debate comprehensive health care for \nthis country, and ways we try to get a handle on health care costs--\nthat is all well and good. But what we have to do if we are going to \ntry to be honest to the consumers and families of this country is talk \nabout what the implications of this legislation are going to be.\n  One of the serious facts that remains is for those people who have \nserious indebtedness through no fault of their own, who have worked \nhard, played by the rules, have gotten health insurance or in other \ninstances lost their jobs, they are not going to be penalized and \nforced into indentured servitude, basically, for the credit card \ncompanies--because they are the principal beneficiaries of these \nprovisions. So it is only fair we say that.\n  People will say we have homestead laws in this country. They apply \nacross the Nation. The fact is, in most of the parts of the country, \nthe homestead provisions are less than $25,000--$25,000 or less. The \nfact is, this legislation applies to 50 States, not to one State or two \nStates. It applies to 50 States. It has application to all the people \nin all 50 States. So if we are going to apply something to all 50 \nStates, why not at least have some uniformity? We think it is difficult \nenough and tragic enough that you are going to have a health challenge \nthat is going to wipe out your family and perhaps even cause death; we \nare not going to take a home away that is worth $150,000.\n  Those are the facts. Those are essentially the provisions. I will \nmention them in greater detail.\n  The first amendment exempts from the means test any debtor whose \nsevere medical expenses have caused financial hardship and forced them \nto file bankruptcy. Financial hardship is defined in the amendment as \none of the following: Being out of work for a month or more or \nunreimbursed medical expenses totaling 25 percent of your income. This \nis your out-of-pocket, after all the other expenses--25 percent of your \nincome. We estimate that about 20 percent of all bankruptcy filers--\nthis doesn't even reach all of those who are going to be medically \nbankrupt, but it would reach about 20 percent of all bankruptcy filers \nin this category. They would be exempted from the means test through \nthese provisions.\n  The proponents of the bankruptcy bill have said the goal of the bill \nis to force those individuals who run up bills irresponsibly to take \ngreater personal responsibility.\n  They claim that people are going to the mall making frivolous \npurchases such as plasma televisions and designer clothes and then \ngoing to bankruptcy court to discharge their debts. Nothing could be \nfurther from the truth for the thousands of individuals who are forced \ninto bankruptcy to deal with the debt they were forced to take on to \ncope with serious medical expenses and the loss of income when they are \nunable to work due to serious illness or injury.\n  We had testimony from Professor Elizabeth Warren of the Harvard Law \nSchool last week making clear that more than half of those filings for \nbankruptcy have been forced to do so at least in part due to medical \nproblems and their aftermath. If the goal of the bill is to deal with \nthose individuals who some feel are abusing the bankruptcy process, we \nought to protect those individuals who are forced into bankruptcy \nthrough no fault of their own.\n  We will listen to the proponents of the bill say: Look, we want to \nhave people responsible here in the United States of America. Those \npeople who go out and buy the fancy yachts, go to the mall, run up \nbills, ought to be held accountable. Absolutely, I say. Put me on as a \ncosponsor. But that ain't what this bill does. As a matter of fact, \nthere is an enormous loophole in this bill that ought to shame its \nproponents who have left it in there with regard to spendthrifts. We \nwill come to that later.\n  Let me finish a brief description of these two amendments.\n  Those who go to bankruptcy court because of cancer or diabetes and \nheart attacks have not been irresponsible. Those who file for \nbankruptcy to deal with medical debts incurred when a child was born \nearly with severe complications or an elderly parent needing costly \nprescription drugs or placement in a nursing home are not \nirresponsible. These clearly are not the type of debtor the proponents \nof this bill say they are; the kinds of debts that the proponents of \nthe bill are trying to address. They deserve a chance to make a fresh \nstart, and a specific exemption from the applications of the means test \ngives them that chance. They will still be subject to the bankruptcy \nlaw as it is today but not the additional kinds of punitive aspects \nthat exist in this proposed bill under the means test.\n  The second amendment provides that medically distressed debtors be \nallowed to protect, at a minimum, $150,000 of the equity in their \nprimary residence through a homestead exemption.\n  The enormous increase in medical debt and the bankruptcy cases caused \nby medical debts, along with the significant increase in real estate \nprices over the recent years, have led to a new and rapidly growing \nproblem. Families who face insurmountable debt problems following \nserious medical problems are faced with obtaining relief from their \ndebts in bankruptcy only if they give up their homes. A family should \nnot have to lose their home to obtain relief from debts caused by \nserious medical problems. These families should not be forced to choose \nbetween debt relief and losing their modest homes.\n  In nearly half of all States, homestead exemptions are less than \n$25,000. Several States have no homestead exemption. People facing \nbankruptcy in these States are often forced to give up their home to \nobtain debt relief.\n  In a chapter 7 bankruptcy case, the family with equity greater than \nthe State exemption limits can be forced to give up their home. In \nchapter 13, the family must pay the creditors an amount equal to the \nequity above the homestead exemption, which they cannot afford. The \namount of equity a homeowner can protect in bankruptcy has not kept up \nwith the rise in home prices. This change of $25,000 has been there for \nyears and years. I don't know where you can find a home in this country \nfor $25,000. With incomes of $800 or $1,000 per month, they could live \nin their current homes, which may be paid off, and have low monthly \ncosts. If they are forced out of their homes, they can't afford to rent \na decent place to live. Effectively, these homeowners have no \nbankruptcy relief available to them. They sell the home, and they are \ntold, OK. They are on a fixed income of Social Security, getting \n$1,000, perhaps, a month. How are they going to be able to afford to \nrent the places available to them at $800 to $1,000 and have enough to \nlive on?\n\n  The notion of forcing people out of their homes after an illness or \nan accident is made more outrageous by the fact that in a handful of \nStates, debtors of all kinds--famous sports figures, doctors who drop \ntheir malpractice insurance, real estate tycoons--can shelter millions \nof dollars in homestead.\n  Do we understand that?\n  In this legislation, there is a handful of States where individuals \ncan shelter their homes from creditors who won't be able to get access \nto it. Yet when we say, OK, let us just protect others in other States \nup to $150,000, they say, No, we are not going to do that, no, because \nyou know the States ought to make the decision. This bill applies to 50 \nStates. If you are going to take that position, why not wipe out the \nexemption that exists for these handful of other States? Where is the \nfairness in this bill? Where is the fairness? Why should wealthy \nindividuals be able to shelter their income in half a dozen States and \nescape all of the harshness of this bill and other hard-working, decent \npeople who have lived in their homes over a lifetime find out their \nhousing disappears as it goes into bankruptcy? Please. Where is the \nfairness? Where in the world is the fairness?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I want to make sure that people following this debate \nunderstand what is at issue.\n  The Senator is talking about someone who, because of the diagnosis of \nmedical illness or treatment of a medical illness, ends up incurring a \ncrushing debt they can't pay back, and their health insurance doesn't \ncover it. The Senator from Massachusetts is suggesting that those \nindividuals who are\n\n[[Page S1897]]\n\nfacing bankruptcy, at least when it is all said and done, have their \nhomes to return to, to the tune of $150,000, which is a modest home in \nmost places in America. Is that what the Senator from Massachusetts is \ntalking about?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is absolutely correct. The average cost of a \nhome in America is $240,000. We are only talking at $150,000. I am sure \nthe Senator can relate to us the kinds of situations that I see of \nthese three-decker houses, not only in Boston but in many of the older \ncities and in my State where families have lived there for years and \nyears. They see the increase in the water rate of $50 to $75, and they \nwonder how they are going to be able to afford it.\n  What we want to say is to those individuals who are faced with \nhardship, worked hard all of their lives, more often than not have been \nable to get health insurance but find out that health insurance is not \nenough. As a result of cancer, serious heart failure, serious \nillnesses, diabetes, or a child that needs special kinds of attention, \nthey go in to debt--after it is all said and done, let them list their \nassets and their liabilities and pay what they need, but don't take \ntheir home away from them.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will yield further for a question, as I \nunderstand, what the Senator is saying is that in some States you could \nhave a person who was a compulsive gambler who went deeply into debt to \nthe point that they faced bankruptcy, but if they are smart enough to \ntake the remaining assets they owned and put them into a home to the \ntune of $1 million--if they pick the right State, such as Florida--that \ncompulsive gambler, irresponsible person who goes to bankruptcy court \nwill be protected by the law of Florida, be able to keep their \nmultimillion dollar home. Yet in a State such as Massachusetts or \nIllinois, if someone faces devastating cancer diagnoses, treatments \nthat costs more than they can ever pay back, they could go to \nbankruptcy court and loose their homes, but the gambler keeps his \nmultimillion dollar home. In other States, the person who has a medical \ndiagnosis they never expected ends up losing their home under the \ncurrent law we are considering.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Perhaps the Senator can explain how that meets any \ndefinition of fairness, how that meets any requirement of treating \npeople equitably.\n  We have the proponents in the Senate Chamber; they ought to be able \nto explain that. They have resisted treating the families the same in \nall parts of the country. This is one of the fatal failures in this one \narea, the homestead area.\n  The Senator is absolutely correct. As the Senator knows, we are \ntalking about individuals who have worked hard more often than not, \nhave gotten health insurance and tried to provide for their families, \nbut then that incident occurs, the cancer occurs, the heart failure \noccurs, the diabetes occurs.\n  We have a growing aging population. Increases in bankruptcy among the \nelderly have risen by two or three times in the last 5 years. The basic \nprojections are increasing because they will have increasing health \ncare needs.\n  We are saying to these individuals who have been part of this \nAmerican fabric and have helped more often than not in fighting our \nwars, they have built this country, saved for their children, now they \nwill end up getting thrown out of their home through no fault of their \nown because they are blighted with some form of cancer.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will yield for a question, I will give an \nexample of a family in my home State of Illinois and what happened to \nthem. Ten years ago, Randall Lemmon and his wife Mary were living in \nChampaign, IL, downstate Illinois. His wife was diagnosed with an \nautoimmune disease, sceradoma, a connective tissue disease which can \ndebilitate very quickly. Within months of her diagnosis, Mary \nexperienced the loss of independent functioning and found herself \nneeding assistance with even the most basic tasks in life. She \neventually collapsed and went to a nursing home, which was not covered \nby the family's insurance. Eventually she died, leaving behind her \nhusband, five children, and a $150,000 nursing home bill. As a result, \nthey were forced into bankruptcy.\n  Currently, in Illinois you can only protect $7,500, up to $15,000 in \nthe value of your home. What could anyone live in for $15,000? Here is \nRandall Lemmon with five children, and because he was forced into \nbankruptcy court he would lose his home.\n  Senator, you are saying, at the minimum, let him at least protect \n$150,000 in his home to raise the five children after his wife has died \nin a nursing home; is that what your amendment says?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is absolutely correct. He gives an \nenormously persuasive argument.\n  These are hard-working people, as the Senator has pointed out, \naffected by an illness. They are getting caught up in the system.\n  This bill was supposed to be about spendthrifts. This bill does not \ntake care of the sheltered income, as the Senator from Illinois points \nout. It does nothing about the corporate irresponsibility where the \ncorporations go into bankruptcy and leave their workers high and dry \nand they walk off with the golden parachutes.\n  We see health care coverage lost for these families who have paid in \nfor 20 or 30 years. WorldCom closed down, Polaroid closed down, Enron \nclosed down, their health benefits are cut off, they get cancer, the \nbills run up, and what does this bill do? It puts them into indentured \nservitude to the credit card companies.\n  We call that fairness? That may be the priority of some in this body, \nbut it is not mine. Who do we in this body represent? The credit card \ncompanies who make record profits? They are the principal beneficiary \nof this legislation: $30 billion in profits last year, and they want \n$35 billion. The best estimate is the credit card companies are going \nto get $5 billion more out of this bill.\n  Who are they going to get it out of? They are going to get it out of \nthat family the Senator from Illinois just discussed.\n\n  That is what we are about in the Senate? We have the problems of \nunemployment, the escalating costs of prescription drugs, 8 million of \nour fellow citizens unemployed, school tuition going through the roof, \nand we are talking about an additional $5 billion for the most \nprofitable industry in America. Hello. Hello. That is what we are \ndebating here. It is extraordinary.\n  I heard this morning that some of our friends on the other side went \nup to the press to announce their poverty program. Imagine that. This \nwill drive more and more people into poverty, and our friends on the \nother side announce how they will address poverty in this Nation. And \nwhat are we seeing happening with the increase of poverty for children? \nFor the first time, again, infant mortality is going up for minorities \nin the inner cities.\n  We have an explosion of asthma in the inner cities of this country, \ntwice the deaths we had 5 years ago as a result of deterioration of \nconditions. My gosh, and we are debating the credit card company \nprofits. This is what we will do to our fellow citizens?\n  Let me mention who else is affected. Christopher Heinrichs was \ndiagnosed with melanoma in 2002 after visiting a dermatologist for a \nroutine consultation after discovering a small discoloration. He was \ngiven a prognosis of 5 years to live. He was director of operations for \na truck parts company. His wife Deborah was a $14-an-hour office \nworker. They had a joint income of $140,000.\n  Listen, middle America, listen to what happened to this family. \nChristopher had good health insurance that covered 90 percent of his \nhospital costs. He also had disability benefits and life insurance \nthrough his employer. The 10 percent cost sharing on Christopher's \nprescription drugs cost $100 a week. Copayments for three surgeries, \nseven rounds of chemotherapy added up. Christopher continued to work \nbut was laid off from his job a year after his diagnosis. He had to pay \n$969 per month to keep his health coverage after he lost his job. \nChristopher's health insurance had a $100,000 maximum benefits cap \nwhich they reached at the same time they learned the cancer had spread \nto his colon. They had to give up the family car and were ultimately \nforced to file for bankruptcy in the summer of 2003 and discharge their \ndebt. Christopher died in April 2004 at the age of 47, leaving his \nwidow and two sons, Joshua, 17, and Travis, 14,\n\n[[Page S1898]]\n\nand left an additional $90,000 in hospital bills for costs after \nbankruptcy. They also have had a bill for $3,100 for Christopher's \ncremation.\n  And we are going after this family with a means test, an additional \nkind of burden to squeeze out whatever this family is going to be able \nto try and put together for the next 5 years? That is what the means \ntest does.\n  Where do you think you get the next $5 billion for the credit card \ncompanies? They get it by squeezing these families for $35, $50 a \nmonth, $75 a month for the next 5 years.\n  Kelly Donnelly was diagnosed with skin cancer, September 2003. Her \nfamily lived in Oswego, NY, with a joint income of $32,000. They owned \na three-bedroom house with a daughter and a second on the way. When \nKelly, 26, became too weak to work, she had to quit her drugstore job, \nleaving the family with only $20,000 in income. Even though Andrew \nreceived health insurance from his job, copayments from Kelly's \ntreatment and medication for the new baby who was delivered prematurely \nso Kelly could undergo cancer surgery, totaled $330 a month. The couple \nlost their house, filed for bankruptcy in August 2004, were forced to \nmove to an apartment, had to give up the family dog because pets were \nnot allowed there. Because they had defaulted on electric bills they \nhad to put down a $500 deposit to turn on the power in their new \napartment. Their medical bills totaled $20,000.\n  This is what is happening. We are going to put additional burdens, \nbesides the existing bankruptcy law, on those people? This bill does.\n  I am going to speak about two individuals whom I will call ``TT'' and \n``ST'' from Minneapolis, MN. They do not want their names mentioned. \nThey had good medical insurance from ``T'' 's job with the State of \nMinnesota, but when ``T'' retired, he could not afford the $941 per \nmonth for his health insurance. He paid for a few months, and then he \ncouldn't anymore. ``S'' was diagnosed with breast cancer in February \n2004, after being misdiagnosed in September 2003. ``S'' was \nmisdiagnosed, as I mentioned, in September 2003, when she had health \ncoverage. The first 3 months of her cancer treatment cost $26,000, and \nthey have no health insurance. They were forced into chapter 13 \nbankruptcy to try to save their home. Unfortunately, they were unable \nto make enough to pay the chapter 13 payments to save their home, and \nthey ultimately had to sell it for less than it was worth before it was \nforeclosed and convert their chapter 13 filing to a chapter 7 case.\n  We have constant examples. We know one out of four people die from \ncancer, and we know about one out of four die from heart disease. We \nknow that today. We can look around at any kind of group. These are the \nstatistics. If you have good health insurance, with the exception, \nperhaps, of the health insurance we have in the Congress of the United \nStates, which we do not extend to the American people--we are pretty \nwell protected, but not those people out there. I am tired, when one \nperson tries to extend the same kind of health care we have to people \nout there, of people on the other side who say: Well, we are not going \nto support you. The problem is the health care problem, and we ought to \ndeal with that. This is a bankruptcy issue.\n  Come on. Come on. They oppose us when we try to pass health care \nlegislation, and then they oppose us when we try to deal with the \nhealth care problems that are going to be impacted by the bankruptcy \nbill. It does not work that way. At the same time, we have all the \ncircumstances that take place in the corporations.\n  I want to mention the various groups, once again, that are supporting \nus. We have the American Bar Association. We have about 80 percent of \nthe representatives of the trade union movement, the Alliance for \nRetired Americans. We have the Consumer Federation of America. We have \nthe Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, which understands that this, \nas well, affects many minorities in this country. We have the National \nWomen's Law Center because of the impact of this legislation on women. \nWe have Physicians For A National Health Program, some 2,000 doctors--\n2,000 doctors from across this country--who understand and say: Do not \npass this bill because of the health implications. Don't do it, Senate, \nif you care about what is happening to your fellow citizens out there \nacross this country. They are facing enough challenges with the \nexplosion of health care costs, the explosion of prescription drug \ncosts, and the dramatic decline in health care coverage. Don't do this \nto them. It is too unfair. It is unwise. But no, no, we are going \nahead.\n  We have support from group after group after group. I think it is \ntime we give consideration and priority to the workers in this country.\n  I will mention, quickly, a final couple of points to give a bit of an \noverview about where we are in these medical bankruptcies. Annually, \nhalf result from illness; nonmedical causes, 54 percent; medical \ncauses, 46 percent.\n  This is from the Health Affairs study that was done this year.\n  We know there is a dramatic increase in the number of uninsured. So \nit makes a good deal of sense we are going to have an increased number \nof medical bankruptcies because we are seeing the total number of \nindividuals who are not being covered dramatically increase. Now it is \nup to 45 million. With all respect, the reason it did not go up higher, \nis because we had the CHIP program that enrolled several million \nchildren. If we had not done that, these figures would be right up \nthrough the roof.\n  Here is the cost. We have not only the coverage issue, but you see \nthe cost of single coverage in 2000 at $2,400; in 2004, $3,600. For \nfamilies, it has gone from $6,300 to $9,950. There has been an \nexplosion in the costs, an explosion in the number of companies that do \nnot provide coverage, and an explosion in the number of companies \nswitching to part-time employees who do not get benefits like \ninsurance.\n  We see the difference in the cost for Medicare premiums and Social \nSecurity. You wonder why this is a particular burden on seniors? Listen \nto this. Basically, seniors paid for their Part B premiums with their \nCOLA increases in Social Security. But what we are finding out now is \nthey are falling farther and farther behind in that ability to pay. \nWhat you are finding out now is the increase in premiums is 72 percent \nover the period of the last 4 to 5 years. For Social Security, it is 12 \npercent. So increasing numbers of seniors on Social Security are unable \nto keep up with part B premiums. And this does not even include the new \nprescription drug bill, where you are going to find out it is even more \ncostly.\n  There are 3.9 million Americans who are affected by bankruptcy. You \nhave 700,000 dependents, 1.3 million children, and the bankruptcy \nfilers, 1.9 million--effectively 4 million of our fellow citizens who \nare affected by this provision.\n  As my friend from Illinois pointed out, when you take a look at the \nfailure to deal with, on the homestead issue, the high rollers in \nStates that have high homestead protections versus working families in \n90 percent of the other States, that is unfairness.\n  In my State of Massachusetts, if you talk about the problems of \nbankruptcy, on the lips of most of the workers would be Polaroid, that \ngreat company that started with Ed Land, who was an absolute genius, \nwho developed instant film. And finally, after he left, the company ran \ninto difficult times, and they went bankrupt. I will mention what \nhappened to those individuals.\n\n  Polaroid filed for bankruptcy in 2001. In the months leading up to \nthe company's filing, the corporation made $1.7 million in incentive \npayments to a chief executive, Gary DiCamillo, on top of his $840,000 \nbase salary. The company also received bankruptcy court approval to \nmake $1.5 million in payments to senior managers to keep them on board. \nThese managers, collectively, received an additional $3 million when \nthe company assets were sold off.\n  By contrast, just before Polaroid filed for bankruptcy, it canceled \nthe health and life insurance for 6,000 retirees, coverage for workers \non long-term disability.\n  Do you understand what we are saying here? Here you have these \nindividuals who lost their coverage. Can you imagine the number of \nthose individuals who do not have health insurance and then run into \nserious health problems, cancer or heart disease? What happens to them?\n  This is a typical example. We have other examples of corporate abuse \nwhich I will come back to. I hope the\n\n[[Page S1899]]\n\nSenate--we might not be accepting a lot of amendments--but I would hope \nthe managers could find a way to accept these two amendments. It would \nmake an enormous difference in terms of the legislation and the \nfairness and its implications for middle America.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I sat here and listened to my dear \ncolleague from Massachusetts, and almost everything he has spoken about \nis a flaw in the current bankruptcy system we are trying to change. It \nis the current bankruptcy system that we have been trying to change for \n8 solid years. And guess who one of the principal voices against \nchanging it is? Why, none other than my distinguished friend from \nMassachusetts, and my distinguished friend from Illinois, who make \nthese great populous arguments on the floor that sound so good. I do \nnot want to characterize them in my Utah terminology, but they are not \naccurate.\n  How is that for being a person who uses discretion?\n  If you listened to the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts, you \nwould think this country can spend trillions of dollars solving every \nperson's problem. I have been here 29 years. I have never heard the \ndistinguished Senator from Massachusetts once ask: Where are we going \nto get the money to pay for this? How do we pay for this? How do we \njustify it?\n  It is easy to talk about taking care of everybody in every way, \nuniversal health care, and to decry a Medicare reform bill that adds no \nless than $400 billion, but maybe as much as $750 billion now--\naccording to CBO, OMB, and other analysts--and say it does nothing for \nthe poor when that is exactly what it does do, a lot for the poor.\n  In the 8 years we have tried to correct these infirmities in the \nbankruptcy bill, we have not had any help from many who are speaking on \nthis floor criticizing this bill today. They have never been for any \nchange unless it is their change in bankruptcy, changes they could not \nget through the Senate floor. And we have come up with a bill that has \nbeen basically passed by huge majorities every time it comes up on the \nfloor because we are trying to correct some of the things the \ndistinguished Senator from Massachusetts is complaining about.\n  Yet I do not believe--and I can't speak for him--that we have a \nchance of having him vote for final passage of this bill. It may be \nbecause he differs with part of it, as I do. But I am trying to do the \nbest we can in two legislative bodies that have great difficulty \npassing legislation as complicated as this with as many nuances and \nchanges as this will make in the current laws that will be for the \nbetterment of people in our society and in our country today.\n  I rise today in total opposition to these two Kennedy amendments. I \ncommend Senator Kennedy for his longstanding commitment to health \nissues. Most of the health care bills that work in this country are \nHatch-Kennedy or Kennedy-Hatch bills over the last 28 years. He knows \nhe can't accuse me of not having compassion for the poor and for those \nwho have difficulty. We wouldn't have passed them had it not been for \nbipartisan efforts of Republicans and Democrats. So don't let anybody \nget on this floor and act as though only one side cares about the poor. \nThat is not only a joke, it is a sad joke at that.\n  I know how devoted the Senator from Massachusetts is, and I share his \ngeneral concerns about people in our society today who are hard-working \npeople. However, I do not believe these two amendments are the answer \nto their problems. We accepted the Sessions amendment yesterday. It \nspeaks directly to the circumstances surrounding serious medical \nconditions, which would be a major change over current law that I \nbelieve the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts and others, \nincluding the distinguished Senator from Illinois, will vote against in \nthe end because they don't agree with some aspects of this bill. I \ndon't agree with some aspects of this legislation, but I have worked my \nguts out to try and get a compromise here that will help the poor, that \nwill help our society and will make people more honest, that will stop \nsome of the fraud and abuse.\n  To continually make this sound as though it is a credit card company \nbill--give me a break.\n  I note the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts mentioned the \nWarren study when he says that half or thereabouts of the people go \ninto bankruptcy because of medical conditions. That study is so flawed, \nnobody who is in their right mind is going to accept everything in it. \nFirst of all, it includes all gambling; that is a medical condition. \nDrug abuse and alcohol abuse, they are medical conditions. I agree \nmaybe that may be. But those are voluntary medical conditions. It may \nbe somebody is crazy because they gamble all the time. I have known \ncompulsive gamblers. But is it a medical condition that justifies \nallowing people to cheat their creditors, as is going on in this \ncountry today? I don't think most people would agree with that. If you \nlook at the statistics in the Warren report, you have to say: My gosh, \nwhy would anybody rely on that?\n  I believe it is worth pointing out that that report includes gambling \ndebts as a medical condition under the rubric of medical expenses. \nLet's get real.\n  This bankruptcy bill is fair. It is needed. I pointed out several \nabuses yesterday, and I am sure will point out more before this debate \nis over.\n  The issues the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts has raised \nare important ones, as far as I am concerned. Make no mistake about it. \nBut I think we ought to change current law to address them. This bill \ndoes to a large degree.\n  All we hear from Democrats over the years is: We need a means test so \nthe rich pay more. Why are they suddenly against a means test to \nprotect the poor, a means test that requires those who can pay \nsomething against their debts rather than every 5 years go into \nbankruptcy after running up bills galore? Why shouldn't they have to \npay or at least try to pay? A means test protects those who are \ndesignated poor. And frankly, there are other rules in this new bill \nthat will protect those who are above the means test better than \ncurrent law.\n\n  I would suggest to the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts, if \nhe wants to correct some of these problems--all of which he has raised \nunder current law as though they are going to be caused by this bill--\nhe ought to vote for this bill, because it takes dramatic steps to \nchange in current law the things he has been complaining about and that \nI happen to be concerned about as much as he is and others on this \nfloor as well on both sides.\n  For 8 years we have fought to bring both sides of this floor \ntogether. For 8 years we have fought to bring both Houses of Congress \ntogether. For 8 years we have tried to correct these deficiencies in \nthe Bankruptcy Code. This bill doesn't correct everything, but it does \nmake strides. It does make real efforts to try and not only be fair but \nto get people to be responsible for their debts when they have the \nability to be responsible for their debts.\n  The issues the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts has raised \nare important ones. Make no mistake about it. But let me shine a little \nmore light on these issues. The people the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts and the distinguished Senator from Illinois have held out \nas victims of the means test will be in fact protected by that test. \nThat is what is amazing to me, how we can hear these populous arguments \non the floor as though that is reality. We have heard this so many \ntimes. As the decibel level goes up, the reality of those arguments is \nless and less real.\n  The Sessions amendment yesterday makes sense, trying to do something \nabout what the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts is complaining \nabout. The things he is complaining about are in the current law we are \ntrying to change. The means test protects the poor.\n  Now are there going to be problems with any bill that comes out of \nthe Congress? Sure. We have to make an effort to do the best we can to \nresolve these problems and this bill does make the best effort we can \nbetween both Houses of Congress to do so.\n  I might add that the other amendment of the distinguished Senator \nfrom Massachusetts provides a homestead exemption for medically \ndistressed debtors. Well, medically distressed debtors should be taken \ncare of under the Sessions amendment because he specifically provides \nfor that.\n\n[[Page S1900]]\n\n  We had a vote this morning on a homestead amendment. We all know we \ncannot accept the amendment. It is an issue for the States, pure and \nsimple. The reason we can't is because after 8 years of careful, \nserious negotiations, after 8 years of that, we have arrived at a \ncompromise that, though imperfect, is the best we can do. That is what \nlegislating is all about. I wish we could make every bill perfect. \nUnfortunately, we have to deal with imperfect people. Some of us may \nthink we are perfect and that everybody should do exactly what we think \nthey should do. That isn't reality around here.\n  So we do the best we can. After 8 years, after multiple votes, and \nafter votes overwhelmingly in favor of this bill, because it makes \ntremendous changes from current law that do protect the poor, and \nothers as well, and those who are losing billions of dollars because of \nit--at least millions, because of fraud--we are trying to do what has \nto be done.\n  Let me make a few remarks about the Kennedy amendment and why it \nshould be rejected. Yesterday, we acted to adopt the Sessions amendment \nby a broad 63-to-32 bipartisan vote. The Sessions amendment included \nmedical costs as a factor to be considered under the special \ncircumstances provisions under chapter 13. That amendment will allow \nthose who make those decisions to determine whether people are going to \nbe inordinately hurt by being pushed into chapter 13. You have to \nbelieve there are idiots in the system who will not resolve these types \nof major problems, especially the ones the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts has been talking about.\n  Please recall that under the so-called means test Senators Durbin and \nKennedy are trying to vilify today--when they are always arguing for \nmeans tests for the rich--will only result in about 10 percent of those \nwho file for bankruptcy will be required to repay any of their debts \nout of future earnings. That is right, only 10 percent right off the \nbat. Eighty percent of those individuals who make under the median \nincome will ever face the prospect of paying past debts out of future \nearnings. Of the remaining 20 percent, only about one-half will ever be \nrequired to pay. When all is said and done, only about 1 in 10 of those \nwho filed for bankruptcy will ever be required to pay past debt from \nfuture earnings under the means test.\n  Medical expenses will be eligible as a factor in determining if and \nhow much money will be repaid by those relatively few--1 in 10--who \nqualify under the mischaracterized means test. That is not an onerous \ntest; it is fair. It treats medical expenses fairly. That is what we \naccomplish with the bipartisan 63-to-32 basically overwhelming vote on \nthe Sessions amendment yesterday.\n  Now, the Senator from Massachusetts opposes this bill. That is no \nsecret. He has opposed every bill we have brought up here in the last 8 \nyears. We should oppose his amendment because the bill already \nadequately responds to the subject matter of his amendment. By the way, \nagain, all of the litany of bad things that are happening to people, \nand especially the hard-working poor, are occurring under the current \nbankruptcy system we are trying to change and make better.\n  I will also acknowledge that I wish I could make this bill even \nbetter. But in all honesty, we are to a point where if we want to \ncorrect the wrongs in society that are occurring in bankruptcy, this is \nthe chance to do it, and then let us work in the future to correct what \nneeds to be corrected in this bill. But this is the only chance we have \nto correct some of the ills the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts is bringing out here today. I commend him for being \nconcerned about those ills, but if he is, he ought to be voting for \nthis bill because we at least do something about it. It may not be \nexactly what he wants; it is not exactly what I want; but it is the \nbest we can do when we consider this bicameral legislative body called \nthe Congress of the United States.\n  Again, I want to speak in favor of S. 256--and I think I have been--\nthe Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005. \nThis issue has become more important over the last 8 years, when we \nstarted to work on reforming the system. It is more important than ever \ntoday. Bankruptcies are up markedly.\n  Over the past decade, look at how they have gone up on this chart. \nFrom 1947, all the way up to 2003, you can see how, since about the \nlate 1980s, it automatically shoots up like mad. I know people in Utah \nwho run up all the debts they can for 5 years, then go into bankruptcy, \nand then they do it again. This is happening much more than it should. \nAs we pointed out yesterday, we have more bankruptcies in 1 year now \nthan they had in the whole Depression of 10 years.\n  The bankruptcy system can be improved. It seems unlikely that \nconsumer bankruptcy abuses are going to get better without this \nlegislation. I will recount some of the glaring facts about this \nproblem. First, we are seeing more bankruptcies filed every year than \nin the entire decade of the Great Depression, as I have mentioned. Our \neconomy has generally grown over the last 10 years, and we have enjoyed \nrelatively low unemployment and low interest rates. But despite this, \nwe continue to see record numbers of bankruptcy filings every year. Why \nis that?\n  One factor may be that too many people view bankruptcy as an easy way \nto erase their debts, rather than as a means of last resort. This \naffects all consumers. When creditors are left without payment, they \nhave to pass these costs on to all of the rest of us. It costs us in \nterms of higher interest rates, higher downpayment requirements, \nshorter grace periods, higher penalty fees, late charges, and retailers \nare forced to raise prices, all because of the abuse of the bankruptcy \nsystem, which this bill would do a great deal to correct.\n  If you want to help the poor, vote for this bill because this bill \nwill save the poor at least $400 a year, minimally, for each household. \nBankruptcy can also cost job loss among those who are victims of \nuncollected obligations. Part of the problem with the current \nbankruptcy system is that it allows certain higher income individuals \nto wipe away debts that they can and should be required to pay. Some \nhave mischaracterized provisions in the bill that require some \nindividuals to repay past debts with future earnings. The provision in \nthe bill--the so-called means test--applies only to those persons above \nthe median income. Where a higher income debtor has the means to repay, \nthe means test established in the bill would require such debtor to \nshoulder more responsibility in paying the bills they have incurred. \nFor debtors below the median income--which is over 80 percent of all \nfilings--there would be no presumption of abuse. But even for those \nabove the median with means to repay a substantial part of their debts, \na judge would still have the ability to allow a liquidation bankruptcy \nto proceed in cases of hardship.\n  This is not the onerous bill that some of my colleagues would have \nyou believe. Throughout the course of the debate over the last four \nCongresses, we have had different arguments from opponents of this \nlegislation. It is always the same opponents. Some of those failing \narguments are rearing their heads again in this debate. And again, the \narguments they are making basically criticize current law that we are \ntrying to change with the bankruptcy bill, we believe for the better. \nCan you find some flaws in this? Of course, and so can I. But it is \nhead and shoulders over current law and over some of the illustrations \nmy friends on the other side have brought up.\n  Let me take a few minutes to dispel a few of the more prominent myths \nabout the bill. First, some suggested that higher debt burdens have led \nto the dramatic spike in bankruptcy filings over the last 25 years. The \nbasic measurement for establishing financial distress shows that this \nis simply not the case. The debt service ratio--a measurement of income \nto expenses--has remained relatively constant over the last 25 years, \nas this chart behind me illustrates. The bottom red line shows the \nbankruptcy filings per 1,000 families from 1980 up until 2001. The \nblack line on the top is the debt service ratio. This shows that \nbankruptcies have not increased due to a decreased ability to make \npayments on debt obligations. Examining the lowest 20 percent of income \nearners shows that even when the debt service ratio in these categories \ndeclined or stayed the same, bankruptcies overall still climbed \ndramatically, as the next chart reveals.\n\n[[Page S1901]]\n\nThe bottom line, as you can see, is consumer liabilities between 1979 \nand 2001. The red line represents consumer assets between 1979 and \n2001. The green line happens to be the consumer net wealth between 1979 \nand 2001. They have all gone up--even the bottom line, the consumer \nliabilities--but not very much. The others have gone up much more. The \nconsumer assets and consumer net wealth have gone up much more.\n  Another measurement of financial distress is net wealth, the amount \nof assets against liabilities. But this test, too, shows that even as \nnet wealth has soared, as was shown on that prior chart, bankruptcy \nfilings have soared as well.\n  This chart makes the point. The bottom line is revolving disposable \npersonal income. That has gone up from 1959 to 2003. The red line is \nthe nonrevolving disposable personal income. As one can see, that has \ngone down. The black line on top is the total disposable personal \nincome which has basically remained the same, except it has gone up a \nlittle bit in these past years.\n  Another exaggerated myth is that increased use of credit cards is the \ncause for more and more bankruptcies. But, again, the facts strongly \nsuggest this simply is not the case. When there has been an increase in \nthe use of credit card debt, this was largely due to a substitution for \nother high-interest debt.\n  The chart behind me shows that while revolving debts, such as credit \ncards, have increased as a percentage of disposable personal income, \nthere is a corresponding decrease in nonrevolving debt. The net effect \nis that overall consumer indebtedness has remained roughly the same.\n  Others have tried to argue that increases in housing costs are a \nmajor reason for skyrocketing bankruptcy filings, but the amount of \nincome going into mortgage expenses has remained steady over the years. \nAccording to Professor Warren's book, ``The Two-Income Trap,'' which \nwas cited favorably by the distinguished Senator from Illinois, Mr. \nDurbin, yesterday, in the early seventies, mortgage payments \nconstituted 14 percent of a typical family's income.\n  Here is a chart showing the allocation of income. The red part on the \nleft, the large part, which is 46 percent, happens to be discretionary \nincome. The purple small part is health insurance, and that amounts to \n3 percent. Discretionary is 46 percent. The mortgage people are paying \nis now 14 percent, about the same as it has always been, in that little \nsection of red. The yellow is automobile, which is 13 percent of \nincome, and taxes are 24 percent.\n  In all honesty, 30 years later, according to Professor Warren, this \npercentage actually fell to 13 percent. As this chart shows, the \nmortgage went down to 13 percent. Obviously, attributing the rise in \nthe bankruptcy rate to higher mortgage payments does not appear to be \nborne out by the facts. Further debunking this myth is the fact that \ndefault rates on mortgages have also remained fairly steady over the \nyears.\n  Another prominent myth about this issue is that about 50 percent of \nall bankruptcy filings is caused by medical debts. We heard the \ndistinguished Senator from Massachusetts in very excited terms talk \nabout these type of debts, medical debts. Undoubtedly, there are many \nbankruptcies caused by medical debts. This is why this bill makes \nseveral exceptions for treatments of health expenses and health \ninsurance, something that does not exist today. These exceptions do not \nexist today. This is why we were so pleased yesterday that the Senate \nadopted the Sessions amendment that explicitly identified medical costs \nas a factor to be taken under consideration by a bankruptcy judge in \ndeciding whether there are special circumstances that affect a debtor's \nability to pay.\n  But the study cited for the proposition that 50 percent of \nbankruptcies are medically related is misleading at best. This claim is \nbased on the study conducted by Professor Elizabeth Warren, but this \nstudy does not even purport to claim that medical bills were the \nprimary basis for half of bankruptcy filings, as the charts of the \nSenator from Massachusetts seem to indicate; the study merely claims \nthat about half the filings were medically related. This is a \ndistinction with a real difference, but we did not hear the difference \nas our friend from Massachusetts was describing this. Only a definition \nof the health problem that is stretched beyond recognition could lead \nto the conclusion that these filings were medically caused. The study \nactually classifies gambling as a medical cause. Gracious, come on. \nGive me a break. Gambling?\n  Finally, let us look at two other exaggerated explanations for \nbankruptcy filings: unemployment and divorce. With respect to \nunemployment, this chart shows that even as unemployment has dropped, \nbankruptcy filings continue to increase.\n  Let me refer to this next chart. The red dots represent the \nunemployment rate. It has been going down since basically 1981. The \nblack dots show the bankruptcies per 1,000 families, and they have gone \nup dramatically, as one can see. If there was a correlation between \nunemployment and bankruptcy, we would have expected bankruptcy filings \nto decrease over the last 25 years, but this obviously has not been the \ncase. In fact, just the opposite has occurred.\n  Again, on divorce rates, bankruptcies have increased by a huge \npercentage, even as we have seen a modest decline in the divorce rate \nover the last 25 or so years. The red line at the bottom shows \nbankruptcies per 1,000 households. Look how it has gone up since about \n1987. The black dots represent the divorce rate per 1,000 households. \nThat went up, but it is now headed down. That is a good thing for our \nsociety. I am glad to see that. But the bankruptcy rates keep going up.\n\n  The bottom line is that despite the low interest rates, low \nunemployment, steady debt ratios, and steady increase in net wealth, \nbankruptcy filings continue to set record highs. Frankly, these facts \nsuggest another reason to explain the increase in bankruptcy filings is \nthat it is simply too easy for some relatively high-income debtors to \nsimply wipe away their debts and stick all the rest of us in society \nwith them, even where they have the means to pay a substantial share of \nthe obligations. It is absolutely unfair to saddle all consumers with \nthe increased costs associated with these off-the-chart levels of \nfilings. This bankruptcy bill we are debating today will cut down on \nsome of these abuses and bring back some sense of accountability to the \nhigh-income debtors.\n  Let me say again, it is one thing to come on this floor and give \nthese wonderful populist talks about how much they love to help the \npoor when, in fact, this bill will do more to help the poor than all \nthose talks in the world. And to complain about this bill when what \nthey are really doing is complaining about the current system, it is \namazing to me.\n  The only thing I can conclude is some people who make these arguments \nactually must believe the people out there are really stupid and that \npopulist arguments really count today, like they used to when people \ndid not have the education Americans have today. That is what those \npopulist arguments are all about. It is easy to stand on the floor, \nshake your fist, scream and shout, and talk about how bad things are \nwhen they are bad because we are not changing them. It is amazing to \nme, absolutely mind-boggling to me.\n  I respect anybody who wants to change these laws and make them \nbetter. The only way we are going to do that is to pass this bill, and \nthe only way we are going to pass this bill through both Houses is to \npass this bill without amendment.\n  If we want to make some changes, let's do it. We have now been 8 \nyears through this stuff, and the same old tired, wornout saw arguments \nare still being made by the people who complain about the current \nsystem as though this bill is going to make the current system worse. \nIt is going to make it better.\n  Again, I will acknowledge it is not a perfect bill. My gosh, nothing \nis around here. But it will make a great difference in some of the \ncomplaints that have been lodged against current law.\n  This bankruptcy bill we are debating today will cut down on some of \nthese abuses and bring back some sense of accountability to these high-\nincome debtors. It will stop some of the fraud and abuse that is going \non. It will\n\n[[Page S1902]]\n\nmake everybody a little more responsible. We put in a lot of other \nprovisions that make corporate America more responsible as well.\n  Could we do more? I suspect we could, but not and pass the bill. That \nis my bottom line right now after 8 years of doing this, after passing \nit four times overwhelmingly in the Senate and overwhelmingly in the \nHouse but not being able to get it signed because the one time it did \ngo to the President, President Clinton pocket vetoed it. So I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting this measure. I hope my colleagues \nwill help us finally pass this important measure because it is long \noverdue. It will help to resolve an awful lot of the problems that we \nhear complaints about on the floor today by those who have done \neverything they could over the last 8 years to kill this bill.\n  If we passed both of the amendments of the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts, even if we could agree that they were good amendments--\nand they are not--I guarantee my colleagues he is not going to vote for \nthis bill. He never has, and I do not think he ever will. His reasons \nare his own, and they are important reasons to him, but I suggest that \nif our colleagues really mean they want to do something about these \nawful current situations, this is the bill to do it with. If this bill \ndoes not prove to be everything that we would like it to be, let us \nwork in the next session of Congress or immediately thereafter to start \ntrying to make changes that might help.\n  This bill is a step in the right direction. It is a very important \nstep forward, and we certainly should not allow any killer amendments \non this bill that would make it impossible to pass once again.\n  Hopefully I have been fair to my colleagues. I have tried to be. But \nI cannot just sit here and let these type of arguments be made without \nsome response, especially since I have heard them over and over again. \nThe complaints are always about current law and some of the aspects of \nthis bill that they just do not like that are essential in order to \npass the bill.\n  So I hope my colleagues will vote against both of these amendments. I \nam going to do everything in my power to see that they are both \ndefeated.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, like the distinguished Senator from Utah, \nthe former chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I agree that this is an \nimportant bill whose time has come. As he said, it is not a perfect \nbill, but it may be the best that we are capable of. Frankly, there is \na lot more we could do to make it better.\n  A few weeks ago, I introduced S. 314, the Fairness in Bankruptcy \nLitigation Act of 2005. Today, I filed amendment 30 to the \ncomprehensive bankruptcy litigation before us, but at this time I will \nnot call up the amendment. This amendment would provide much needed \nprotection for consumers, creditors, workers, pensioners, shareholders, \nand small businesses--in short, virtually everyone who is a stakeholder \nin bankruptcy litigation in this country today. It would do so by \nreforming the rules governing venue in bankruptcy cases to combat forum \nshopping, otherwise known as judge shopping, by corporate debtors.\n  The sad fact is that today judge shopping is endemic in our \nbankruptcy courts and has led to the abuses of the law, abuses that \nchallenge our national aspiration to be a nation that believes in and \nactually practices equal justice under the law.\n  My experience in my former capacity as attorney general of my State, \nparticularly with the Enron bankruptcy, which has gained quite a bit of \nnotoriety, opened my eyes to a very real abuse in our current \nbankruptcy system and the need to end the current practice of judge \nshopping. After seeing how that bankruptcy played out, I do not believe \nthat we can only be concerned with the letter of the law. We need to be \nconcerned as well with how that law is administered, venues where those \ncases are litigated, and necessarily with accountability and \naccessibility of working men and women, the creditors, and everyone \nelse who is affected by bankruptcy litigation.\n  My amendment would prevent corporate debtors from moving their \nbankruptcy thousands of miles away from the communities and the workers \nwho have the most at stake, and it would prevent bankrupt corporations \nfrom effectively selecting the judge in their own cases, because \npicking the judge is not far off from picking the result.\n  I know that my distinguished colleagues from Delaware do not like \nthis particular amendment, and they have voiced their concerns to me \ndirectly and candidly, which I appreciate, but it is principally \nbecause their State is the beneficiary of the status quo with huge \npercentages of all bankruptcies occurring in the United States--that \nis, in all 50 States--ending up in Delaware and to a lesser extent in \nNew York.\n  I believe the record is clear that forum shopping hurts people in the \noverwhelming majority of the States and necessarily the overwhelming \nmajority of our citizens, and that this amendment, if adopted, would \nserve the national interest.\n  This reform is good government. It is good for the economy. It is \ngood for consumers. To those concerned, as I have heard those concerns \nexpressed so far in this debate that we have not done enough to combat \nbankruptcy abuses, particularly on the part of corporate debtors, I ask \nthem to seriously consider this amendment. This amendment would \nimplement a major recommendation from the October 1997 National \nBankruptcy Review Commission report and has earned support by prominent \nbankruptcy professors and practitioners nationwide. It has also gained \nbipartisan support from people who have seen the problems of the \ncurrent system up close, including numbers of attorneys general, 24 of \nwhom, along with the Attorneys General of Puerto Rico and the U.S. \nVirgin Islands, have signed a letter in support of S. 314.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record, \nfollowing my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. CORNYN. This legislation has also been endorsed by the National \nAssociation of Credit Management and the Commercial Law League of \nAmerica. This amendment also protects small businesses, and that is why \nit has been endorsed by the National Federation of Independent \nBusinesses. Because it protects consumers, it is supported by the \nConsumer Federation. This amendment would protect and restore the \nintegrity of our civil justice system, and that is why, as I said, it \nis endorsed by a bipartisan coalition of our Nation's State attorneys \ngeneral.\n  This amendment would send a message that we recognize the danger of \nthis growing crisis which negatively affects so many consumers and \nworkers and that we are committed to achieving fairness and truly \ncomprehensive bankruptcy reform.\n  Sadly, our current bankruptcy venue law has become a target for \nenormous abuse. It is a problem that has been well documented by \nscholars in the field, most recently in a comprehensive book published \nearlier this year by UCLA law professor Lynn M. LoPucki, as well as by \nHarvard law professor Elizabeth Warren, whose name has been invoked \nnumerous times in this debate, who served as a reporter for the \nNational Bankruptcy Review Commission, as well as Professor Jay L. \nWestbrook of the University of Texas Law School.\n  I know that Professor LoPucki has been in contact with the office of \nvirtually every Member of this body, including, it is reported to me, \npersonal contact with 71 Senators. The professor has documented \ninstances of forum shopping by corporate debtors that have harmed \nconsumers and workers in virtually all of our States.\n  I had personal experience with this abuse during my service as \nattorney general of the State of Texas. I argued that the Enron Federal \nbankruptcy litigation should occur in Houston, TX. That seemed to me to \nbe a commonsense argument, of course, because Houston, after all, is \nwhere the majority of employees, the majority of pensioners, the \nmajority of creditors and every other stakeholder involved in that \nbankruptcy was located. Of course, many of these people were victimized \nby this corporate scandal that occurred, unfortunately, in my State.\n\n  Yet that is not where the case ended up, not in Houston, TX, but, \nrather, in\n\n[[Page S1903]]\n\nNew York. Enron was able to exploit a key loophole in bankruptcy law to \nmaneuver their proceedings as far away from Houston, TX, as possible. \nThey ended up in their desired forum, and that is, as I mentioned, New \nYork. Enron used the place of incorporation of one of its small \nsubsidiaries in order to file their bankruptcy in New York and then \nused that smaller claim as a basis for shifting all of its much larger \nbankruptcy proceedings into that same court.\n  Let me make it clear. This company had 7,500 employees in Houston, \nbut they filed for bankruptcy in New York where it had only 57 \nemployees. This blatant kind of forum shopping, judge shopping, makes a \nmockery of all of our laws. The commonsense amendment which I have \nfiled will combat such egregious forum shopping by requiring that \ncorporate debtors file where their principal place of business is \nlocated or where their principal assets are located, rather than their \nState of incorporation, and forbidding parent companies from \nmanipulating the venue by first filing through a subsidiary.\n  Bankruptcy venue abuse is not just bad for our legal system, it hurts \nAmerica's consumers, creditors, workers, pensioners, shareholders, and \nsmall businesses alike. Under the current law, corporate debtors \neffectively go to the court that they themselves pick. Debtors can \nforum shop and pick jurisdictions that they think are more likely to \nrule in their favor. If debtors, in fact, get to pick the jurisdiction, \nthen bankruptcy judges, unfortunately, according to Professor LoPucki \nand others, have a disturbing incentive to compete with other \nbankruptcy courts for major bankruptcy litigation by tilting their \nrulings in favor of corporate debtors and their lawyers. As a result, \ncreditors can also be forced to litigate far away from the real world, \ntheir real world location, where costs and inconvenience associated \nwith travel are prohibitive--in fact, leading too many of them to \nsimply give up rather than to expensively litigate their claims in a \nfar-off forum.\n  This troubling loophole serves to unfairly enable corporate debtors \nto evade their financial commitments; it badly disables consumers, \ncreditors, workers, pensioners, shareholders, and small businesses from \npursuing and receiving reasonable compensation from bankruptcy \nproceedings.\n  There are numerous examples. Let me mention three of the more \nprominent ones.\n  In 2001, in October, Boston-based Polaroid filed for bankruptcy in \nDelaware, listing assets of $1.9 billion. Polaroid's top executives \nclaimed that the company was a ``melting ice cube'' and arranged a \nhasty sale for $465 million to a single debtor. This same court refused \nto hear testimony as to the true value of the company and closed the \nsale in only 70 days. The top executives went to work for the new buyer \nand received millions of dollars in stock. Meanwhile, disabled \nemployees had their health care coverage canceled. The so-called \nmelting ice cube became profitable the day after the sale became final.\n\n  In January of 2002, K-Mart filed for bankruptcy in Chicago, a venue \nwhich had reportedly been active in soliciting large corporate debtors \nto file there. With a workforce of 225,000, K-Mart had more employees \nthan any company that had ever filed for bankruptcy nationwide. The \njudge in that case let the failed executives take tens of millions of \ndollars in bonuses, perks, and loan forgiveness. Bankruptcy lawyers \nalso profited, pocketing nearly $140 million in legal fees. But some \n43,000 creditors received only about 10 cents on the dollar.\n  The third example I would like to mention is WorldCom, known for \nperpetrating one of the biggest accounting frauds in the history of our \ncountry, inflating its income by $9 billion. Although based in \nMississippi, WorldCom followed Enron to New York bankruptcy court where \nits managers received the same sort of lenient treatment that I \nmentioned a moment ago. No trustee was appointed. Indeed, 5 months \nafter the case was filed, the debtors in office when the fraud occurred \nstill constituted a majority on the board. They, in fact, chose their \nown successors. A top WorldCom executive used money taken from the \ncompany to build an exempt Texas homestead, and WorldCom took no \naction. That executive then used the homestead to buy his way out of \nhis problems with the SEC. Meanwhile, creditors, mostly bondholders, \nlost $20 billion.\n  This is not the first time Congress has addressed this important \nissue. The House Judiciary Subcommittee on Commercial and \nAdministrative Law held a hearing on July 21, 2004, entitled \n``Administration of Large Business Bankruptcy Reorganizations: Has \nCompetition for Big Cases Corrupted the Bankruptcy System?'' \nCongressman Sherman of California has led efforts to champion \nbankruptcy venue reform in that body.\n  During the 107th Congress, my colleague from Illinois, Senator \nDurbin, introduced S. 2798, the Employee Abuse Prevention Act of 2002, \njoined by the Senators from Massachusetts, the Senator from Vermont, \nand the Senator from West Virginia, which also would have reformed \nbankruptcy venue law. Congressman Delahunt of Massachusetts introduced \nthe same legislation in the House.\n  I believe we need to take the next logical step to respond to this \nimportant problem. The American people deserve better from our legal \nsystem when it comes to corporate bankruptcies. All bankruptcy cases \ndeserve to be handled fairly and justly, and no corporate debtor should \nbe allowed to escape responsibility by fleeing to a far-flung venue. It \nis high time we make this important and needed reform.\n  As I have indicated earlier, I have filed this amendment, but I have \nnot called it up but certainly reserve the right to do so during the \ncourse of these proceedings. I have listened closely to the Senator \nfrom Utah and others, the Senator from Iowa, the chief sponsor of this \nlegislation, who say that amendments to this bill would endanger its \nultimate passage. While I certainly am sympathetic to what they have to \nsay, I still believe these amendments ought to be decided on their \nmerits, not based on perhaps concerns that are expressed about \namendments jeopardizing a bill. In fact, I would think, indeed, in \nevery instance the chief sponsor of the bill would ask Senators to \nrefrain from filing any amendments, believing that their bill without \namendments would have a better chance of ultimate passage. But that is \nnot how our legislative process works.\n  I have, nevertheless, decided to refrain from calling up this \namendment at this time. As I said, I reserve the right to do so later. \nI also reserve the right to ask for the yeas and nays and a vote on \nthis amendment. But I have refrained from calling it up out of respect \nfor the managers of this legislation, out of respect for Chairman \nGrassley, the chief sponsor, and out of respect for the American \npeople, who deserve to have better than they have under the status quo \nand who deserve to see this bill pass.\n  I hope I have made clear that judge shopping when it comes to \nbankruptcy litigation is a cancer that needs to be cut out, corrected, \nand cured.\n  I do hope my colleagues in this body will listen, will study this \nparticular piece of legislation, and will lend their support.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                    March 2, 2005.\n\n     RE: S. 314, the Fairness in Bankruptcy Litigation Act of \n         2005.\n\n     Hon. John Cornyn,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cornyn: We understand that the United States \n     Senate is about to debate S. 256, the Bankruptcy Abuse \n     Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005. We write to \n     express our hope that, in doing so, the Senate will also take \n     action on S. 314, the Fairness in Bankruptcy Litigation Act \n     of 2005, which we support and which you introduced on \n     February 8, 2005. After all, consistent with the title of S. \n     256, your legislation to reform the bankruptcy venue laws \n     would indeed help prevent some of the worst abuses we have \n     witnessed in bankruptcy litigation, and provide much needed \n     protection to consumers as well as to the innumerable other \n     parties--large and small alike--that are harmed by \n     opportunistic forum shopping by corporate debtors: creditors, \n     workers, pensioners, retirees, shareholders, and small \n     businesses.\n       As state attorneys general, we are charged with a solemn \n     duty to enforce the law, to protect consumers, and to combat \n     corporate wrongdoing. It is bad enough that corporate \n     scandals have victimized countless American\n\n[[Page S1904]]\n\n     citizens in recent years. What's worse, many corporations \n     have abused the bankruptcy venue laws and engaged in unseemly \n     forum shopping in order to avoid their financial \n     responsibilities. All too often, corporate debtors have fled \n     their home states to pursue relief in far away \n     jurisdictions--and in search of judges more friendly to the \n     corporations' interests than to the interests of those the \n     corporations have left behind. As you noted in your remarks \n     upon introducing the legislation, literally thousands and \n     thousands of workers, shareholders, retirees, small \n     businesses and countless other Americans are regularly \n     thwarted from protecting their interests and left financially \n     stranded as a result.\n       Your legislation has already received an impressive and \n     broad range of support, and the undersigned--a bipartisan \n     group of state attorneys general from across the country \n     united in a commitment to protect consumers and curb abusive \n     corporate judge-shopping--is pleased to add its strong \n     support. Not only does S. 314 finally implement a major \n     recommendation from the October 1997 National Bankruptcy \n     Review Commission report, it is supported by innumerable \n     bankruptcy law professors and practitioners nationwide; the \n     National Federation of Independent Business; counsel for the \n     Enron Employees Committee; Brady C. Williamson, who served as \n     chairman of the National Bankruptcy Review Commission; and \n     major national bankruptcy organizations like the National \n     Association of Credit Management, the Commercial Law League \n     of America, and the National Bankruptcy Conference.\n       We commend your efforts to strengthen our bankruptcy system \n     and protect consumers, creditors, workers, pensioners, \n     shareholders, retirees, and small businesses against unsavory \n     forum shopping by corporate debtors. Passage of S. 314 will \n     end this gamesmanship, help restore credibility to our \n     nation's bankruptcy laws, and safeguard the interests of \n     Americans from all walks of life.\n       We urge the United States Senate to pursue every means \n     necessary to enact the provisions of your bill into law.\n           Sincerely,\n       Scott Nordstrand, Acting Attorney General of Alaska.\n       Mike Beebe, Attorney General of Arkansas.\n       Bill Lockyer, Attorney General of California.\n       John Suthers, Attorney General of Colorado.\n       Mark Bennett, Attorney General of Hawaii.\n       Lisa Madigan, Attorney General of Illinois.\n       Stephen Carter, Attorney General of Indiana.\n       Charles Foti, Jr., Attorney General of Louisiana.\n       J. Joseph Curran, Jr., Attorney General of Maryland.\n       Tom Reilly, Attorney General of Massachusetts.\n       Mike Cox, Attorney General of Michigan.\n       Mike Hatch, Attorney General of Minnesota.\n       Jay Nixon, Attorney General of Missouri.\n       Patricia Madrid, Attorney General of New Mexico.\n       Brian Sandoval, Attorney General of Nevada.\n       Wayne Stenehjem, Attorney General of North Dakota.\n       Hardy Myers, Attorney General of Oregon.\n       Roberto Sanchez-Ramos, Secretary of Justice of Puerto Rico.\n       Patrick Lynch, Attorney General of Rhode Island.\n       Lawrence Long, Attorney General of South Dakota.\n       Paul Summers, Attorney General of Tennessee.\n       Greg Abbott, Attorney General of Texas.\n       Mark Shurtleff, Attorney General of Utah.\n       Alva Swan, Attorney General of the Virgin Islands .\n       Rob McKenna, Attorney General of Washington.\n       Darrell McGraw, Attorney General of West Virginia.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I have come to the floor today to briefly address the pending \nlegislation. This issue forces us to face a fundamental question about \nwho we are as a country, how we progress as a society, where our values \nlie as a people, how do we treat our fellow Americans who have fallen \non hard times, and what is our responsibility to cushion those falls \nwhen they occur. We do so not only out of compassion for others but \nalso knowing that hard times might at any moment fall on ourselves.\n  The proponents of this bill claim it is designed to curb the worst \nabuses of our bankruptcy system. I think that is a worthy goal shared \nby all those in this Chamber, and we can all agree that bankruptcy was \nnever meant to serve as a ``get out of jail free'' card for use when \nyou foolishly gamble away all your savings and don't feel like taking \nresponsibility for your actions.\n  But to accomplish that, this bill would take us from a system where \njudges weed out the abusers from the honest to a system where all the \nhonest are presumed to be abusers, where declaring chapter 7 bankruptcy \nis made prohibitively expensive for people who have already suffered \nfinancial devastation.\n  With this bill, it doesn't matter if you run up your debt on a trip \nto Vegas or a trip to the emergency room; you are still treated the \nsame under the law. You still face the possibility that you will never \nget a chance to start over.\n  It would be one thing if most people were abusing the system and \nfalling into bankruptcy because they were irresponsible with their \nfinances. I think we need more responsibility with our finances in our \nsociety as well as from our Government. But we know that for the most \npart bankruptcies are caused as a result of bad luck.\n  We know from a recent study, which was mentioned by the distinguished \nSenator from Massachusetts, that nearly half of all bankruptcies occur \nbecause of an illness that ends up sticking families with medical bills \nthey can't keep up with.\n  Let me give you as a particular example the case of Suzanne Gibbons, \na constituent of mine. A few years back, Suzanne had a good job as a \nnurse, and a home on Chicago's northwest side. Then she suffered a \nstroke that left her hospitalized for 5 days. Even though she had \nhealth insurance through her job, it only covered $4,000 of the $53,000 \nin hospital bills. As a consequence of that illness, she was soon \nforced to leave her full-time nursing job and take a temporary job that \npaid less and didn't offer health insurance. Then the collection \nagencies started coming after her for her hospital bills that she \ncouldn't keep up with. She lost her retirement savings, she lost her \nhouse, and eventually she was forced to declare bankruptcy. If this \nbill passes as written without amendment, Suzanne will be treated by \nthe law the same as any scam artist who cheats the system. The decision \nabout whether she can file for chapter 7 bankruptcy would not account \nfor the fact that she fell into financial despair because of her \nillness.\n  With all that debt, she would have to hire a lawyer and pay hundreds \nof dollars more in increased paperwork. After all that, she still might \nbe told she is ineligible for chapter 7 bankruptcy.\n\n  As much as we like to believe that the face of this bankruptcy crisis \nis credit card addicts who spend their way into debt, the truth is it \nis the face of people such as Suzanne Gibbons. It is the face of \nmiddle-class Americans.\n  Over the last 30 years, bankruptcies have gone up 400 percent. We \nhave had 2,100 more in Illinois this year. We also know what else has \ngone up: the cost of childcare, the cost of college, the cost of home \nownership, and the cost of health care which is now at record highs. \nPeople are working harder and longer for less, and they are falling \nfarther and farther behind.\n  We are not talking about only the poor or even the working poor here. \nThese are middle-class families with two parents who both work at good-\npaying jobs that put a roof over their heads. They are saving every \nextra penny they have so their children can go to college and do better \nthan they did. But with just one illness, one emergency, one divorce, \nthese dreams are wiped away.\n  This bill does a great job helping the credit card industry recover \nprofits they are losing, but what are we doing to help middle-class \nfamilies to recover the dreams they are losing?\n  The bankruptcy crisis this bill should address is not only the one \nfacing credit card companies that are currently enjoying record \nprofits. We have to look after those hard-working families who are \ndealing with record hardships. As Senator Dodd, Senator Feinstein, and \nothers have pointed out, this bill also fails to deal with the \naggressive marketing practices and hidden fees credit card companies \nhave used to raise their profits and our debt. Charging a penalty to \nconsumers who make a late payment on a completely unrelated credit card \nis but one example of these tactics. We need to end these practices so \nthat we are making life easier not only for the credit card companies \nbut for honest, hard-working, middle-class families.\n  If we are going to crack down on bankruptcy abuse, which we should, \nwe should also make it clear we intend to\n\n[[Page S1905]]\n\nhold the wealthy and the powerful accountable as well.\n  One example: In my own State, we had a mining company by the name of \nHorizon that recently declared bankruptcy and then refused to pay its \nemployees the health benefits it owed them. A Federal bankruptcy judge \nupheld the right of Horizon to vacate the obligations it had made to \nits workers. The mine workers involved had provided a total of 100,000 \nyears of service and dedication and sacrifice to this company. They had \nspent their entire lives working hard. They had deferred part of their \nsalaries because there was an assurance that health care would be \navailable for them. These are men and women with black lung disease, \nwith bad backs, with bad necks, and the company made a decision to go \nback on their promise, saying we will not pay the debt we owe these \nworkers. And a Federal bankruptcy judge said that is OK, you are \npermitted to do that.\n  These same workers now are going to have a tough time as a \nconsequence of this bill filing for bankruptcy. The irony should not be \nlost on this Chamber. It is wrong that a bill would make it harder for \nthose unemployed workers to declare bankruptcy while doing nothing to \nprevent the bankrupt company that puts them in financial hardship in \nthe first place from shirking its responsibilities entirely.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. OBAMA. I yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. As I understand it, these workers had health insurance \nthat would have protected them as a result of illness and sickness. \nThey had it probably for themselves and their families. What the \nSenator is saying is obviously in most of these circumstances when they \nhad health insurance, they sacrificed wage increases and other kinds of \nbenefits in order to get that health insurance. As I listened to the \nSenator, I heard that many of these workers have worked for lifetimes \nfor this company. Now, as a result of the company going into \nbankruptcy, these workers effectively lost their health care coverage. \nI imagine a number of them may have some illness, perhaps some health \ncare needs, probably an older population, and the cost to them to \nreplace that kind of family coverage would be rather dramatic.\n  Mr. OBAMA. It would be prohibitive.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Particularly if they are out of work.\n  What we are talking about here is, if they run into illness and \nsickness under the existing bankruptcy laws, they have a chance to be \nable to measure their assets and their creditors to be able to at least \ngo on to another day. They may pay a fearsome price in terms of their \nown lives, but under the circumstances of the bill as proposed, they \nwould be treated even more harshly.\n  As I listened to the Senator, he was talking about a rough sense of \nequity in terms of legislation that we ought to be considering here in \nthe Senate.\n  Mr. OBAMA. That is an accurate assessment by the distinguished \nSenator from Massachusetts. I appreciate that amplification.\n  The central point is, what kind of message does it send when we tell \nhard-working, middle-class Americans, you have to be more responsible \nwith your finances than the companies you work for? They are allowed to \nbe irresponsible with their finances and we give them a pass when they \nhave bad management decisions, but you do not have a pass when \nconfronting difficulties outside of your control.\n  We need to reform our Bankruptcy Code so corporations keep their \npromises and meet their obligations to their workers. I remain hopeful \nour companies want to do the right thing for workers. Doing so should \nnot be a choice, it should be a mandate.\n  Senator Rockefeller and I have proposed two amendments to ensure \nthis. I strongly urge my colleagues' support. One will increase the \nrequired payments of wages and employee benefit plans to $15,000 per \nindividual from the current level of $4,925. It requires companies that \nemerge from bankruptcy to immediately pay each retiree who lost health \nbenefits an amount of cash equal to what a retiree would be expected to \nhave to pay for COBRA coverage for 18 months.\n  The second amendment prevents bankruptcy courts from dismissing \ncompanies' Coal Act obligations to pay their workers the benefits they \nwere promised. These companies made a deal to their mine workers. They \nshould be forced to honor that deal. That will be an amendment that \nhopefully will be added to the pending bill.\n  This bill gives a rare chance to ask ourselves who we are here to \nprotect, for whom we are here to stand up, for whom we are here to \nspeak. We have to curb bankruptcy abuse and demand a measure of \npersonal responsibility from all people. We all want that. We also want \nto make sure we are helping middle-class families who are loving their \nchildren and doing anything they can to give them the best possible \nlife ahead.\n  To wrap up, in the 10 minutes I have been speaking, about 30 of those \nmiddle class families have had to file for bankruptcy. We live in a \nrapidly changing world, with an economy that is moving just as fast. We \ncannot always control this. We cannot promise the changes will always \nleave everyone better off. But we can do better than 1 bankruptcy every \n19 seconds. We can do better than forcing people to choose between the \ncost of health care and the cost of college. We can do better than big \ncorporations using bankruptcy laws to deny health care and benefits to \ntheir employees. And we can give people the basic tools and protections \nthey need to believe that in America your circumstances are no limit to \nthe success you can achieve and the dreams you may fulfill.\n  While, unfortunately, I cannot support this bill the way it is \ncurrently written, I do look forward to working with my colleagues in \namending this bill so we can still keep the promise alive.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield for one more question?\n  Mr. OBAMA. I yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. As I listened carefully to the excellent presentation of \nthe Senator from Illinois on this legislation, this legislation has \nbeen presented as though it is for going after spendthrifts, \nindividuals who abuse the credit system, who go out and live life high \non the hog, go to the malls, buy the expensive clothes and charge it \nup. These individuals should not be let off scot-free. I gather from \nremarks of the Senator from Illinois he agrees with me, that we want \naccountability for those individuals.\n  Legislation that ought to be targeted toward those individuals and \ncorrected with a hammer is addressed with a cannon, picking on the \nworking families in its path who face bankrupcy through no fault of \ntheir own, as a result of the explosion of health care costs, the \nexplosion of housing costs, explosion of tuition cost, the outsourcing \nof jobs, the increase in part-time jobs, and the issue of a growing \nolder population which has a greater proclivity toward serious illness \nand disease such as cancer and stroke, and increasing numbers of \nindividuals who are virtually cast adrift by major companies such as \nEnron, WorldCom, and Polaroid, and the company from Illinois the \nSenator has mentioned. The sweep of this legislation is going to be \nunduly harsh on a lot of hard-working, middle-income families playing \nby the rules, struggling for their families. They will be treated \nunjustly.\n\n  Mr. OBAMA. That is an accurate statement by the distinguished Senator \nfrom Massachusetts. He characterizes it correctly.\n  I add that all the statistics I have seen indicate one of the fastest \ngrowing segments engaged in bankruptcy is senior citizens who I don't \nthink are any different than they were back in the day when we think \npeople were more responsible and more thrifty. I think they are still \nthrifty and responsible. What has happened is they are experiencing \nextremely tough times partly because they are having difficulty paying \nfor prescription medicines that are not covered under Medicaid.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If the Senator will yield further, the Senator mentions \nthe number of bankruptcies for our senior citizens has tripled in the \nlast 10 years. The average income for those over 65 is $24,000. These \nare not great populations of free-spending people ringing up large \nexpenses at the mall.\n  Shouldn't we take a look at the impact of the legislation before the \nSenate and the impact it will have on our population?\n\n[[Page S1906]]\n\n  I commend the Senator for bringing this very important fact to the \nattention of the Senate. We have three times the number of bankruptcies \nnow for our senior citizens. These are not the spendthrifts. Are those \nthe people we are trying to catch with punitive measures in this \nbankruptcy legislation? I don't think so.\n  The Senator made a strong point. I thank him.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I commend my colleague from Illinois \nbecause he pointed to several issues in our State which dramatized the \nproblem with this bankruptcy bill. This Horizon Mining Company in \nsouthern Illinois when it goes out of business not only shortchanges \nshareholders but leaves retirees in the lurch. We have reports of \nindividuals who worked a lifetime for this mining company, paid in as \nthey were supposed to, expecting to receive health care benefits after \nthey retired, and then the company files bankruptcy and men and women \nwith serious health issues--black lung and emphysema--find themselves \nwithout health care protection before they are eligible for Medicare. \nThese are the people falling into the bankruptcy courts.\n  Our friends on the other side of the aisle say we need to change \nbankruptcy law because of moral failures in America, immoral conduct by \npeople walking into the bankruptcy court when they should just pay \ntheir bills.\n  We go to the people who are supposed to monitor abuse in bankruptcy \ncourts and they say of all the bankruptcies filed, only 3 percent--3 \nout of 100--may fall in that category. The credit card companies say it \nmay be as high as 10 percent--1 out of 10--who should not be filing for \nbankruptcy. But, still, we are going to change the law for everyone \nwalking into the court.\n  We find in reality--the Senator from Massachusetts has made this \npoint--we are not talking so much about moral failures leading to \nbankruptcy, we are talking about economic failures leading to \nbankruptcy.\n  Professor Warren from Harvard Law School went out and actually asked \nthe people filing bankruptcy, Why are you here today? What forced you \ninto bankruptcy? Almost half of the people said medical bills. Three-\nquarters of those filed bankruptcy because the cost of their treatment \nwas more than they could pay; three-fourths of them had health \ninsurance when they were diagnosed, but it was not enough, or they lost \ntheir job, or the copays overwhelmed them.\n  If you are following this debate and you say, isn't it a shame these \npeople did not plan for their future--the man who worked in the mine \nfor 35 years planned for his future. He worked every day and he \ncontributed every day to a pension, believing he would have health \ncare. Guess what. Bankruptcy comes along, and he has no health care.\n\n  Take a look at the people walking into bankruptcy court. Did they \nplan for their future? They had health insurance. But it was not good \nhealth insurance. It had limits on it, and a catastrophic illness wiped \nthem out. Is there one of us who believes we are somehow sheltered from \nthis? Well, come to think of it, there may be. It could be Members of \nCongress believe they are sheltered from this. Do you know why? We have \na pretty generous health insurance plan, as most Federal employees do. \nAnd when we retire, we are protected by that health insurance plan.\n  What is the likelihood a Member of Congress or retired Member of \nCongress will end up in bankruptcy court because of medical bills? Slim \nto none. So we live in this bubble, those of us in Congress, this \nbubble of protection, and think the whole world has the benefits we \nhave. They do not.\n  Senator Kennedy has been arguing for years to take the same health \ncare Members of Congress receive and offer it to America. Whoa, what a \nradical idea, another Kennedy extremist position, to take the same \nhealth care of Congressmen and offer it to America. If we did that, we \nwould not be talking about medical bankruptcy in the numbers we are \nfacing today. But there are these bankruptcies by people who planned, \nby people who had health insurance, by people who paid a lifetime into \nthe system believing they protected their family. They are that \nvulnerable.\n  Along comes the credit card industry that says: We want to change the \nbankruptcy law so if you get crushed by medical bills, you cannot get \nout from under. You keep paying and paying and paying for a lifetime. \nOne of Senator Kennedy's amendments says, losing your home because of a \nmedical crisis in your family in bankruptcy is a tragedy we should \navoid. He is right. Think about it.\n  I can give you examples. Let me give you one. I say to Senator \nKennedy, I think this illustrates the point you are making. Senator \nKennedy is trying to protect at least $150,000 worth of home for \nsomeone who goes into bankruptcy because of a medical crisis. Let me \ntell you about some people in Illinois.\n  Joyce Owens raised a son and a foster son and took care of her \nhusband. She worked full time as a paralegal. Everything was fine with \nher family. She lived in Chatham, IL, 20 miles from my hometown. Then, \nin April 1997, her two sons Chris and Darrell were hit by a drunk \ndriver. Darrell was killed. Chris, 27 years old, had a severed spinal \ncord and was rendered a quadriplegic.\n  Joyce was doing paralegal work at home because she wanted to stay \nthere with her son Chris. He was in a wheelchair and needed help all \nthe time. Slowly, working and caring for her son every day got to be \ntoo much and she was laid off.\n  Then, in 2000, 3 years after the accident, her husband died of a \nheart attack. He had always told her: Don't worry, I have life \ninsurance. He did not. There was no life insurance. She was left to pay \n$200,000 in medical bills incurred by her quadriplegic son and the \ndeath of her husband.\n  How about that? Is that a moral failure? What did she do wrong \nmorally? She worked her life to help her family, and when her son was \nin his worst condition, she did everything she could to help. And then \nshe lost her husband as a helping hand. A moral failure? She tried to \ndeclare bankruptcy. Do you know why she did not? She would have lost \nher home--the home that was set up for her quadriplegic son.\n  So there she faces the dilemma. There is a lien on her home for the \nmedical bills. She will not give it up because she cannot think of \nanother place where her son can be taken care of. So what does it mean? \nA lifetime of $200,000 in debt for a woman who is doing her level best \nto take care of her family. She is one of the victims of this bill.\n  Under this bill, if she went to bankruptcy court, she would lose her \nhome. She would not have enough equity in it to keep it. What is she \ngoing to do with that boy? He is now over 30 years old. She has \ndedicated the rest of her life to him.\n  Senator Kennedy says, if you face that tragedy in your family, we are \ngoing to protect your home. When it is all said and done, you get \n$150,000 worth of home after your medical bills are wiped out. Is this \nsuch an outrage to say to the credit card companies, to say to the \nfinancial companies: You ought to be a little bit concerned about Joyce \nOwens of Chatham, IL?\n  This is a good woman, a good mother, a good wife, from a good family, \nstruggling every day, who is going to be hammered by this bill. She is \nno moral failure. She, in my view, is a moral standard for all of us to \nlive up to. And this bill is going to penalize her because some Members \nof Congress think the credit card industry deserves more profit at her \nexpense.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Because this is a dramatic family circumstance--I think \nany of us who have listened have found this is too often not the \nexception but too often is the rule. But aren't there other provisions \nin this legislation to preserve those homes that are not just the homes \nof someone who has sacrificed, as she has, to try to preserve the home \nfor her son, but that this legislation, as it exists now, has \nprotections for homes that are worth many, many, many, many, many more \ntimes that will escape any kind of threat from bankruptcy because of \nthe homestead exemption? And could the Senator explain to me how we can \npossibly pass a piece of legislation that is so unfair to some families \nand gives such extraordinary benefits to others? Where is, possibly, \nthe equity and the fairness?\n  As a member of the Judiciary Committee, does the Senator not wonder\n\n[[Page S1907]]\n\nwhy in the world those who have been the principal sponsors of this \nlegislation have not tried to address that during all the time we have \nbeen considering it, whether it was when we considered it 4 years ago \nor when we considered it in the committee markup? There was absolutely \nno attempt to do that. There was a strong effort by our friend and \ncolleague Senator Kohl, who did an outstanding job with our last \nlegislation that was before us. I am very hopeful he will offer a \nsimilar amendment this time.\n\n  But how could we possibly allow a system that is going to take that \nhome from that family the Senator has outlined, and at the same time \npermit half a dozen different States to be able to have individuals \nshelter hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of real estate?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts. I think people \nliving in Illinois are some of the luckiest people in the world. I \nthink it is a wonderful State. I am proud to represent it. But for \nJoyce Owens' situation, if she faced the same tragedy with her family \nand they lived in Florida, Texas, or Kansas, she could keep her home. \nYou may say, why? Well, because the States have different standards--\nall the States.\n  What Senator Kennedy says is, this is national legislation, and we \nshould have a national standard to protect families' homes when they \nface a medical crisis.\n  In my State, you cannot protect much, if any, of a home. That is why \nJoyce Owens will be paying off these bills and facing debt collectors \nand harassment the rest of her natural life. She has no way out.\n  The Senator is exactly right; if you happen to live in one of these \nthree States, you hit the jackpot. Do you know what some of the real \nsharp people do in bankruptcy? Bowie Kuhn--do you remember that name?--\nformer Commissioner of Baseball. A prosperous man, right? Well, he got \npretty deeply in debt one day, so he decided to take all of his assets \nand buy a mansion in Florida and file for bankruptcy. He filed for \nbankruptcy and got out from under his debts, but they let him keep his \nmultimillion-dollar mansion in Florida. Bowie Kuhn got to keep his \nmansion. Joyce Owens cannot even keep her home to try to care for her \nquadriplegic son.\n  And you say to yourself, my friends on the other side of the aisle, \nsurely in your home States you have people like this. You must be able \nto find them if you get outside this bubble we live in here and speak \nto people in the real world. Senator Kennedy is speaking to people in \nthe real world, and this is what he is hearing. This is what I hear, \nand what Senator Obama and others hear. That is why his amendment is so \nimportant.\n  Yesterday, we lost an amendment that said if you were serving in the \nGuard or Reserve, activated to duty in Iraq, and you go over there to \nserve your country and risk your life for America, and you lose your \nbusiness and go into bankruptcy because you are overseas serving \nAmerica--I offered an amendment to say, at least give those soldiers a \nchance in bankruptcy to protect their homes.\n  Do you know what happened to that amendment? We lost it, 58 to 38. \nMany of the 58 Senators who voted against that amendment for the Guard \nand Reserve are the first ones waving the flag in the Fourth of July \nparade: How much we love our soldiers.\n  Where were they yesterday? These great lovers of the American \nmilitary were nowhere to be found when they had a chance to do \nsomething for them when they serve their country and face bankruptcy at \nhome.\n  Here is a chance for some of our colleagues who talk long and hard \nabout feeling the pain of ordinary families to do something. The \nKennedy amendment offers them a chance to do something, to say that in \nthe bankruptcy court, we will acknowledge the disasters that families \nface across America because of medical bills, and we will do something \nabout it.\n  I salute the Senator for his leadership, and I look forward to \npassing the amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I see my colleagues, and I want to hear from them. But I \nwelcome the fact that the Senator has brought up the issue of the \nNational Guard and Reserve. There are some in this body who think that \nwith the acceptance of the Sessions amendment we have protected the \nGuard and Reserves. That is absolutely wrong. The Sessions amendment \nonly refers to the expenditures of health care after the individual has \nalready been submitted to the means test, and it only applies to future \nexpenditures of health care by the Guard or the Reserve. It is my \nunderstanding that the trustee already has that flexibility and that \nauthority. I welcome the opportunity to submit with the Senator from \nIllinois a legal technical analysis of that amendment that will reflect \nclearly the fact that those guardsmen and reservists who are \nactivated--and I believe the figure is up to 20,000; I know we used the \nfigure 16,000 yesterday, but I believe the figure is closer to 20,000--\ndo not have the protections that the Senator from Illinois wanted to \nprovide for them.\n  We have to be serious about this. Hopefully, we will not be caught up \nin cliches and slogans. The Senator from Illinois had an amendment that \nwould have had a direct impact on protecting the Guard and Reserve. The \nSessions amendment does not do that because the Sessions amendment only \napplies to provisions that would apply to future health outlays. Those \nexpenditures could already be considered by the trustee in bankruptcy.\n  I don't see how those who voted for the Sessions amendment and \nagainst the Durbin amendment could believe they have met the \nresponsibilities to our National Guard and Reserves. I appreciate, \nagain, the Senator reminding us about the importance of protecting our \ntroops. We are down in terms of recruitment on the Guard and Reserve to \ncritical numbers. We are not meeting our amount for Reserves and the \nNational Guard at the present time. If we pass this legislation in this \nform it will be a powerful message to those guardsmen and reservists \nwho are self-employed, out there trying to serve our country under \ndifficult and trying circumstances, and who are in many instances the \nsole proprietor of a small business, that they get into the Guard and \nthe Reserve at their risk because this legislation will put them at \ngreater risk.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  We let down the Guard and Reserve yesterday. Military families and \ngroups supported my amendment, but 58 Senators voted against it. They \ndecided that the men and women serving in the military, risking their \nlives, were not entitled to any breaks when it came to filing \nbankruptcy because as they were overseas their families and businesses \nfailed. That was the decision yesterday. Fifty-eight Senators said, no, \nthey are not entitled to any special help.\n  Today we have a chance to give a helping hand to people facing \nmedical crises. Over half of the bankruptcies in America involve people \nwho faced a medical crisis and were crushed by it. They turned to \nbankruptcy court. Senator Kennedy gives them a chance in that court to \ncome out with dignity and to start their lives anew. He gives them a \nchance to keep their homes. Is this unreasonable? I don't think it is. \nIt is only fair. I gladly support the amendments of the Senator and \nthank him for offering them both.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, a recent study by Professor Elizabeth \nWarren and her associates at Harvard exposes the flawed rationale for \nthis legislation. According to Professor Warren, about 2 million \nAmericans experienced medical bankruptcy, with half of all bankruptcy \nfilings citing medical causes as a major factor. Among those who cited \nillness as a cause of bankruptcy, their average reimbursed medical \ncosts since the start of their illness was nearly $12,000, even though \nmore than three-quarters had health insurance at the onset of their \nillness.\n  Professor Warren's study found that those who filed for medical \nbankruptcy did everything they could to keep from filing. In the 2 \nyears before they actually declared bankruptcy, those who filed after \nsuffering a serious illness or injury went through extensive sacrifices \nas they struggled to pay for their health care and make ends meet. One \nin five went without food. One-third had their electricity shut off. \nHalf lost their phone service. One in\n\n[[Page S1908]]\n\nfive were forced to move. And many more went without needed health care \nor couldn't fill a needed prescription. And 7 percent actually had to \nmove an elderly relative to a less expensive home.\n  According to Professor Warren, families were bankrupted both directly \nby medical costs and indirectly from lost income when they were \nphysically incapable of working. Diagnoses commonly named by those \nfiling medical bankruptcy include heart disease, trauma or orthopedic \nproblems, cancer, diabetes, pulmonary disease, childbirth related or \ncongenital disorders, ongoing chronic illness, or mental disorders.\n  Interestingly, most medical bankruptcy filers had health coverage at \nthe onset of their illness. More than three-quarters had coverage, and \nless than 3 percent voluntarily chose to go without insurance. The \nmajority of those without insurance could not afford to maintain it, \nwhile almost 1 in 10 could not obtain coverage because of pre-existing \nhealth conditions.\n  A significant loss of income or years of piling up medical debt \nbecause of ongoing medical needs frequently makes bankruptcy \nunavoidable. The average out-of-pocket cost since the beginning of the \nfiler's illness was significantly higher, averaging $11,854, although \nmany had much higher costs. The average out-of-pocket costs for those \nwith cancer was $35,000, while those families dealing with neurological \ndisorders averaged more than $15,500.\n  The Harvard study looks at the reality of people who file bankruptcy \nand what forces them into bankruptcy, and it shows that 50 percent of \nthose debtors had significant medical debt. The proponents of this bill \nwant to ignore this reality because it doesn't fit in with their \nrhetoric about the bill.\n  My amendment focuses on those people for whom medical debts and lost \nincome due to illness were the primary factors in their bankruptcies. \nTheir medical debts would have to equal 25 percent or more of their \nannual income or they have to have lost one month's income due to their \nillness. This is what it means to be a medically distressed debtor \nunder my amendment. Those families clearly deserve laws that will \nprotect them. As currently written, this bill does not protect those \nwho were forced into bankruptcy by a serious family illness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 32\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, before I call up my amendment, let me \ncompliment the Senator from Massachusetts for his continued argument on \nbehalf of the men and women who work very hard for a living, are put \ninto difficult circumstances because of medical care costs, and end up \nin a situation that is extraordinarily heavy handed and insensitive to \nthe realities of what is going on with the cost of health care. I \ncompliment him and the Senator from Illinois for looking after our men \nand women in uniform.\n  All of these are areas where the overall Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention \nand Consumer Protection Act is missing the point. So much of what is \noccurring in the personal bankruptcy area is a function of personal \nsituations, things that are circumstances beyond the control of the \nindividual. I will talk about another one, economically distressed \ncaregivers, in my amendment.\n  It is impossible to think that we need to use a means test as the \nbasis of how we are solving this problem, particularly when we are \ntaking a completely unbalanced approach and not looking seriously at \ncorporate bankruptcy. Now we read in the paper today, we have these \nprotection trusts that are offshore, and we even learn they are \nonshore. It was published in the New York Times today about how the \nwealthy can protect their assets, not even using the homestead. They \njust set up a trust and it is automatic. They can avoid it. But someone \nwho has grave medical difficulties, and in my amendment, the long-term \ncare situation, there is a lack of fairness that people are just not \naddressing when we are talking about Bankruptcy Code changes that \nreally are harsh on those people most vulnerable in our society.\n  I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to setting aside the \npending amendments? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Corzine] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 32.\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To preserve existing bankruptcy protections for individuals \nexperiencing economic distress as caregivers to ill or disabled family \n                                members)\n\n        On page 19, strike line 13, and insert the following:\n        monthly income.\n       ``(8) No judge, United States trustee (or bankruptcy \n     administrator, if any), trustee, or other party in interest \n     may file a motion under paragraph (2) if the debtor is an \n     economically distressed caregiver.''.\n       On page 113, between lines 19 and 20, insert the following:\n       (4) by inserting after paragraph (14A), as added by this \n     Act, the following:\n       ``(14B) `economically distressed caregiver' means a \n     caregiver who, in any consecutive 12-month period during the \n     3 years before the date of the filing of the petition--\n       ``(A) experienced a reduction in employment for not less \n     than 1 month to care for a family member, including a spouse, \n     child, sibling, parent, grandparent, aunt, or uncle; or\n       ``(B) who has incurred medical expenses on behalf of a \n     family member, including a spouse, child, sibling, parent, \n     grandparent, aunt, or uncle, that were not paid by any third \n     party payer and were in excess of the lessor of--\n       ``(i) 25 percent of the debtor's household income for such \n     12-month period; or\n       ``(ii) $10,000.''; and\n       (5) by inserting after paragraph (44), the following:\n       ``(44A) `reduction in employment' means a downgrade in \n     employment status that correlates to a reduction in wages, \n     work hours, or results in unemployment.''.\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, economically distressed caregivers are \nthose who have incurred substantial medical debt on behalf of dependent \nor nondependent family members. This is the easy thing, taking care of \nmom and dad. It is a normal value concept in America that people look \nafter their seniors. Sometimes that comes at an enormous cost to those \nfamilies' ability to maintain their employment status or reduced hours \nor wage levels. Many people have to go on the unemployment rolls.\n  There are an estimated 44 to 50 million family caregivers in our \ncountry, a large number. Nobody really knows the number. These \nAmericans spend anywhere from a few hours a week to 40 hours a week or \nmore taking care of a loved one, sick or disabled.\n  These individuals provide an enormous service to our society because \nthe costs they take up are not borne by the broader society through \nMedicaid or other areas, and they provide an enormous benefit to their \nfamilies. The economic estimate of this value is over $257 billion \nannually. According to the National Family Caregivers Association, in \nmy home State, there are 830,000 or so family caregivers. So New Jersey \nhas 830,000 of these people in a population of about 8.5 million. \nAlmost 10 percent of the population is involved with family caregiving. \nThe estimated value is just shy of $8 billion.\n  That unpaid care comes with a real cost. According to Harvard Law \nSchool Professor Elizabeth Warren, whom I know Senator Kennedy has \nquoted a number of times in the presentation, approximately 125,000 \nAmerican families in this long-term care situation, family caregiving \nsituation, go and declare bankruptcy each year because of their \ninability to work. It is really a Hobson's choice about whether they \ntake care of their families or go to work. It puts them in an \nincredible position of choosing what they think is right for their \nfamily or whether they deal with the economic system, which now, \naccording to the means test, will put them into chapter 13. It is an \nincredible thing that we are foisting on the American people.\n  I have one anecdote everybody should look to regarding the practical \nreality of these situations. A young lady from Blackwood, NJ, wrote to \nmy office talking about this bill. She is 31 years old and the sole \ncaregiver for her husband, who is 47 and has Lou Gehrig's disease. He \nis in a long-term care situation. He will be there for as long as he is \nable to sustain himself with this tragic disease. They have four young\n\n[[Page S1909]]\n\ndaughters, 11, 7, 2, and 6 weeks old. She is the sole caregiver. She \nhas $40,000 in medical bills, with untold numbers ahead of her. The \nfinancial strain for her and her children will put her into bankruptcy. \nIs this a lady who ought to go directly to chapter 13 because she \ndoesn't meet the median income standard?\n  It is inconceivable in my mind that we are prepared to let those who \nare doing very well in life set up these protection trusts that we know \nabout, which protect the wealthy who have fancy homes and homestead \nrebate situations, and the young woman in Blackwood cannot protect \nherself, her four daughters, and take care of her husband. This is \noutside of the realm of reason, and it doesn't make sense economically \nfor the country because what is going to happen is this individual is \ngoing to be on charity care or Medicaid to take care of the medical \nbills of her husband, who has Lou Gehrig's Disease. They are going to \nturn somewhere, and we are going to pay for it. We have taken away the \nopportunity for that individual to take care of her family. And $257 \nbillion worth of long-term caregiving is the estimate we have in this \nsociety. We are going to put that at risk through this bill. We ought \nto amend that. We ought to have standards set with regard to \nindividuals who are giving care to their families and those they are \nresponsible for and take care of these 125,000 folks who declare \nbankruptcy each year and make sure they are not forced into chapter 13. \nThis is a mistake. It is essential that people recognize what we are \ndoing here in a practical sense--undermining that safety net provided \nto families and individuals. I hope my colleagues will support my \namendment and support Senator Kennedy's because the broader question of \nmedical care is a driving force in over 50 percent of all of the \nbankruptcies in this country.\n  It is hard to imagine that we are going to put folks into this \nindentured servitude, which is only going to lead to most of them using \nother social services in the country and will rack up even higher costs \nin Medicaid and charity care. The cost is going to come out, and the \ncredit card companies are going to benefit. It doesn't seem to be a \nsensible economic practice.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If the Senator will yield, those who have been \nproponents say: Look, we have these spendthrifts who use these credit \ncards and go to the malls and exceed their credit, and there has to be \naccountability and responsibility to make sure they are going to \neffectively be dealt with. So we have, allegedly, this legislation. It \nhas been pointed out during the course of the debate that even the \ncredit card companies say it is less than 10 percent of all filers that \nfall in to this spendthrift category. Most of the commissions that have \nstudied bankruptcy over a period of time have actually put it at 4 or 5 \npercent. Nonetheless, we are passing this legislation that is going to \nhave the impact that the Senator has mentioned in terms of those who \nare involved in long-term care or those who are elderly and have three \ntimes the bankruptcies today then they did in the past, with the \naverage income for seniors being $25,000--large spendthrifts, seniors, \nlarge spendthrifts. But the tragedy is that they run into the health \ncare challenges, cancer or stroke, and they run up these medical bills, \nand they will end up losing their homes and with their lives virtually \nbeing destroyed.\n\n  Does the Senator not agree that we ought to be able to fashion pretty \neasily legislation to deal with those who are involved in the excesses \nof spending in relationship to credit, and we ought to have \naccountability for those people? But that isn't what this bill is, is \nit? That isn't what this legislation is really all about, is it? \nDoesn't the Senator agree with me that we could fashion a bill to \naddress the needs that are out there? But this bill isn't it. I would \nbe interested in the Senator's view, as somebody who has had great \nexperience and a background in understanding both credit and the \nfinancial world. I believe his views on this would be enormously \nvaluable.\n  Mr. CORZINE. The Senator from Massachusetts asks the correct \nquestion. What is the problem we are addressing here? Is it a narrow \nproblem of a few abusers of the credit system--and the estimates I see \nare 10 percent or less--and when we address that, are we encompassing \nfar too many people who are situationally disadvantaged by how the \nbankruptcy system would work in future circumstances?\n  The Reserve and Guard folks who the Senator from Illinois talked \nabout, the people who are dealing with an out-of-control cost structure \nin our medical system or long-term caregivers--44 million people who \nare looking after seniors and disabled in this country are getting not \na whit paid for from that. We are going to impose a cost on them that \nwe are going to end up paying back in the Medicaid system? It is just \nbad economics. It is not even smart public policy, saying, let's do an \naccounting estimate of what the cost is and the way it is today, where \npeople are providing $257 billion worth of aid, and we are going to \nturn around and force that into a system. I don't know. Where I came \nfrom, we like to look at the costs and the benefits, and we try to \nidentify the right side of the equation.\n  In my view, this bankruptcy bill is not taking into account these \nvery important situational circumstances. It is going to raise \nenormously the cost of doing health care business in this country and \nthe cost of recruitment in our military, and the only people who will \nbenefit are the guys who have the smart lawyers who will teach them how \nto put protective trusts together and move to Florida or wherever the \nhomestead protections are the highest. It is a disaster economically, \nas well as for individuals' lives.\n  I appreciate the question. We ought to try to work to amend this \nlegislation so we are dealing with the 10 percent of the people who are \ntrying to avoid paying their bills. Most people do not want to be in \nbankruptcy.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a Consumer Federation of America be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Hon. John Cornyn,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cornyn: The Consumer Federation of America \n     applauds your efforts to prevent corporations in financial \n     trouble from fleeing their home states to declare bankruptcy \n     in courts far from their workers, retirees, shareholders and \n     small business vendors. We strongly support S. 314, the \n     Fairness in Bankruptcy Litigation Act of 2005, which would \n     require corporations to declare bankruptcy in the states in \n     which they are headquartered or have their principal assets, \n     as opposed to their state of incorporation. It would also \n     forbid parent companies from filing first through a \n     subsidiary corporation in an effort to manipulate the \n     bankruptcy venue.\n       The raft of corporate scandals in the last few years has \n     exposed many flaws in a system of market oversight that used \n     to be the envy of the world. Many investors lost faith in our \n     markets, tens of thousands of employees lost their jobs and \n     retirees have lost significant portions of their pension \n     plans. Corporate officers systematically looted their \n     companies and lined their pockets, even as their companies' \n     financial position began to deteriorate.\n       To add insult to injury, firms like Enron and Worldcom \n     filed for bankruptcy in New York, far from their headquarters \n     in Texas and Mississippi. Other infamous bankruptcies \n     involving the Boston-based Polaroid Corporation and Texas-\n     based Continental Airlines ended up in Delaware courts. By \n     filing for bankruptcy thousands of miles from their principal \n     place of business, these companies were gaming the system. \n     They chose bankruptcy courts well-known for their leniency \n     with debtor corporations. These firms were also shutting out \n     employees, retirees, small business vendors and some \n     creditors from meaningfully participating in the bankruptcy \n     proceeding, making it far more likely that these individuals \n     would end up financially stranded.\n       Thank you for your efforts to correct this corporate \n     bankruptcy abuse. I strongly urge you to formally offer it as \n     an amendment to bankruptcy legislation, S. 256.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                           Travis B. Plunkett,\n\n                                             Legislative Director,\n                                   Consumer Federation of America.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To limit the amount of interest that can be charged on any \n                   extension of credit to 30 percent)\n\n        At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. TERMS OF CONSUMER CREDIT.\n\n       (a) Cap on Interest Chargeable.--A creditor who extends \n     credit to any consumer shall not impose a rate of interest in \n     excess of an annual rate of 30 percent with respect to the \n     credit extended.\n       (b) Preemption of State Law.--The provisions governing \n     rates of interest under subsection (a) shall preempt all \n     State usury laws.\n       (c) Exemption to Preemption.--If a State imposes a limit on \n     the rate of interest chargeable to an extension of credit \n     that is less than the limit imposed under subsection (a), \n     that State law shall not be preempted and shall remain in \n     full force and effect in that State.\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I salute my colleague, Senator Kennedy, \nfor his powerful and heroic statements today on behalf of the people of \nAmerica who do not have the time or the money to come to Washington or \nhire expensive lobbyists to press their causes in the Senate. He has \nchampioned their concerns for decades now.\n  I am very proud to have been a member of his caucus a short while \nago, listening to him speak the truth about this legislation, which is \na totally one-sided assault on real Americans, the folks we see out \nthere in our States who cannot be here because they are working, \nbecause they have earned a decent living, a middle-income living, but \nthey are not getting rich, and they are not taking advantage of \nprograms, but they have suffered the kind of personal misfortunes \nSenator Kennedy, Senator Durbin, and others have described--serious \ninjuries, illnesses to themselves, to their spouses, or to their \nchildren. But they do not have health coverage, or they actually find \nout now they have health coverage, but the gaps in that coverage are so \nlarge or the copayments are so high they run up debts they cannot \nafford.\n  We can talk about people who lost their jobs and often, therefore, \ntheir health coverage, which means they have added economic misfortune \non to a health crisis. They are the targets of this legislation, the \nvictims of this legislation. It is self-entitled the Bankruptcy Abuse \nPrevention and Consumer Protection Act. If this bill is a consumer \nprotection act, believe me, the consumers of America are in very \nserious trouble. This is a Credit Card Company Protection Act. The poor \ncredit card companies of America are the innocent victims, we are being \ntold, if we believe what we are hearing from the other side, of some \nsupposed massive consumer fraud when, in fact, in the 8 years since \nthis legislation was first introduced, the number of credit card \nsolicitations in this country has doubled to 5 billion a year. Between \n1993 and 2000, the amount of credit extended to people in this country \ngrew from $77 billion to almost $3 trillion.\n  During the 8 years of the existence of this legislation, the \nbankruptcy filings in America have increased by 17 percent, and the \ncredit card company profits have increased by 163 percent, from $11.5 \nbillion to over $30 billion in profits last year. Does that seem like \nan industry that is facing a financial crisis or is being taken \nadvantage of by people who are trying to get out from under their \nresponsibilities? Not at all. In fact, the opposite. In fact, the \nopposite is that the credit card companies are taking advantage of \nAmericans, not the other way around.\n  Some courts around the country have demanded that the credit card \ncompanies disclose the amount that remains to be repaid from what was \nactually borrowed and how much are the fees, the penalties, and the \ninterest rates they are charging. It turns out that with the interest \nrates conventionally charged and the terms and conditions that are \nwritten into these agreements, many of the credit card companies are \nactually billing two times or more than the amount that is actually \nborrowed or remains to be paid. Often now it is higher than that.\n  Here is a form of a loan operation in my home State of Minnesota \ncalled Money Centers. Their slogan is: ``We make it easy.'' They make \nit easy all right. Their annual interest charge is 384 percent. But \nthat is a bargain compared to Check and Go in Wisconsin. Their annual \ninterest charge is 535 percent. Both of them combined do not equal the \ninterest rate that is charged by the County Bank of Rehoboth Beach, DE, \nwhose annual interest rate is 1,095 percent of annual interest charged \non the amount that is borrowed. Now that is real abuse. That goes way \nbeyond what we call predatory lending. That is ``terroristic'' lending. \nYet this bill before us does nothing about those lenders' abuses that \ndrive far more people into bankruptcy than what we are hearing about \nfrom the other side today.\n  This legislation does nothing about hospitals and other health care \nproviders who charge uninsured patients much more than they charge \ntheir insured patients, or those covered by programs such as Medicare \nand Medicaid, and then turn around and charge exorbitant interest rates \non top of on bills of tens of thousands of dollars to the very people \nthey are supposed to be helping who cannot possibly afford, with \nmoderate incomes, to repay those kinds of costs.\n  That overcharge for the uninsured is why an overnight stay at a \nVirginia hospital costs $6,000 if someone is on Medicaid, but it costs \n$29,000 if it is Paul Shipman who had a heart attack and is uninsured. \nThat is why a woman named Rose Schaffer, who is now being harassed by a \nhospital collection unit after she suffered a heart attack, said:\n\n       The hospital saved my life, but now they are trying to kill \n     me.\n\n  This bill also does nothing about the abuses of bankruptcy laws that \nallow large corporations to declare bankruptcy, dump their pensions and \ntheir retiree health benefits, and then emerge from bankruptcy and \nleave thousands of innocent victims. I met with some of them just this \nlast week in my State of Minnesota. It is heartbreaking. It makes you \nwant to cry, and then it makes you so angry at the injustice that has \noccurred to good, hard-working men and women who have worked all their \nlives, played by the rules, did everything they are supposed to do, did \ntheir part, helped build these companies, and now they are retired and \nthe companies go into bankruptcy, such as mining companies. As one of \nthe workers said: A company gets the mine, and we get the shaft. The \ncompany comes out of bankruptcy court proceedings and it is profitable \nagain, having left behind its pension obligations and its health \nobligations to retirees--people who are betrayed, abandoned, and left \ndestitute with no recourse whatsoever.\n  Those are the terrible and huge abuses of bankruptcy laws that are \ndestroying lives in Minnesota and across this country and are leaving \nAmerican taxpayers with billions of dollars of unfunded pension \nobligations that they are going to have to pay rather than the \ncompanies that incurred them. This legislation before us does nothing \nabout addressing those abuses.\n  A spokesperson for the distinguished chairman of the Senate Finance \nCommittee, the author of this legislation, Senator Grassley, said on \nbehalf of Senator Grassley, when he recently reintroduced the \nlegislation:\n\n       People who have the ability to repay some or all of their \n     debts should not be able to use bankruptcy as a financial \n     planning tool so they get out of paying their debts scot-free \n     while honest Americans who play by the rules have to foot the \n     bill.\n\n  I do not think any of us would disagree with that; I certainly would \nnot. Then I see these companies using bankruptcy law as a financial \nplanning tool, as a corporate car wash where they can go through and \nclean their ledgers of these obligations to workers and retirees and \ncome out, reestablish profitability, and these men and women, good \nAmericans, are left behind with nothing.\n  Again, that is an injustice enough by itself, but the other result is \nthe taxpayers pay the bill. This bill does nothing about that. So my \namendment actually adds a real consumer protection clause to the bill \nthat otherwise does not deserve the name. It would limit the maximum \nannual interest that could be charged by anyone, any lender, to 30 \npercent.\n  Now, that tells us how bad things are in this country, that a 30-\npercent interest charge would actually be a reduction. Right now \ninflation has been running less than 2 percent annually. The\n\n[[Page S1911]]\n\ncurrent rate for a 3-month Treasury bill is 2.75 percent. The prime \nlending rate is 5\\1/2\\ percent. Thirty percent as a ceiling of what \ncould be charged annually is still consumer abuse, but it is a lot \nbetter than 384 percent or 1,095 percent or 1,095 percent. So that is \nwhat this amendment would do. It would set a limit of the annual \ninterest rate that could be charged by any lender to 30 percent.\n  If somebody believes it is not profitable for them to lend money, for \nwhatever reasons, liability, likelihood of repayment, whatever else, \nthat it is not profitable at a 30-percent annual interest, I say it is \nnot a wise loan for the lender and it is not a wise loan for the \nborrower.\n  We have too many people in this country who are taking advantage of \nothers and charging these astronomical, shameful, disgraceful, and they \nought to be illegal, rates of interest and taking advantage of those \npeople, driving them deeper into debt, many of those that my colleagues \nhave cited as being the culprits in this situation, the nonhealth care \nborrowers who are running up these credit card debts.\n  If someone is paying 384-percent interest a year, they are going to \nrun up that debt very fast. If someone is paying 1,095-percent interest \non anything they have borrowed, believe me, anybody in this country is \ngoing to be needing to file for bankruptcy very fast. This bill does \nnot even mention those abuses.\n  This amendment would put a real consumer protection clause into this \nbill and for that reason, as well as basic justice, we should do what \nthis body is supposed to do, which is to stand up and protect \nAmericans. I urge my colleagues to give it their support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Brownback's \nname to this amendment as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, this amendment is offered on behalf of \nthe Senator from Arizona, Mr. Kyl, and myself. Because Senator Kyl has \nan urgent appointment, I will make a very brief statement and then turn \nit over to Senator Kyl, and then I will wrap up. I ask unanimous \nconsent to be able to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today 144 million Americans have \ncredit cards and they are charging more debt than they have in the \npast. Let me give one example of that. Credit card debt between 2001 \nand 2002 increased 8\\1/2\\ percent. Between 1997 and 2002, it increased \n36 percent, and between 1992 and 2002, it increased by 173 percent. \nForty to 50 percent of all credit card holders make only the minimum \npayment.\n  I am a supporter of the bankruptcy bill, but here is the rub: \nIndividuals get six, seven, or eight different credit cards, pay only \nthe minimum payment required, and then end up with debt rolling over \ntheir shoulders like a tsunami. That happens in case after case. So \nthat is the predicate for this amendment. It is like Senator Akaka's \namendment, but it is less onerous than the amendment of Senator Akaka. \nI will explain that, but first I defer to my cosponsor, the Senator \nfrom Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from California for \ndeferring because I do have only a moment. I join her in speaking in \nfavor of this amendment and laying it before our colleagues. The point \nof the bankruptcy reforms is to try to help people get into a position \nto pay their obligations freely contracted and to try to make sure that \ncreditors get as much of what they are owed as possible. Part of that \nis to try to help people not get into situations where they are not \ngoing to be able to pay their debts, and that is the basic philosophy \nof this amendment.\n  One can go too far and put conditions on companies such as credit \ncard companies, for example, that are so onerous that they cannot \npossibly comply. People want to have ease of dealing with credit cards, \nbut one can also get into a lot of trouble with credit card debt, as \neverybody acknowledges. It can get away from a person if they are not \ncareful. What this amendment does is to borrow from a California \nstatute that was declared invalid in California by a Federal court only \nbecause it was preempted by the Federal law, the Truth In Lending Law, \nwhich we are hereby amending, so that that same provision would apply \nagain in California and to the other States as well.\n  It requires the companies that offer these cards, when they find \nsomeone is paying the minimum amount on a monthly basis, to let them \nknow what will happen or what can happen if they continue to do that, \nwhich is essentially that a person is going to end up paying a lot of \ninterest and they are going to end up with a huge debt at a certain \npoint in time that they are not aware of. They need to be aware of it. \nSo we are going to tell the person either hypothetically, if it is not \npossible to do it on an individual basis, or individually, what the \nconsequences of their paying this minimum amount are, a way to try to \nhelp people understand what they are doing and thereby better arrange \ntheir affairs so they can pay their debts, and therefore the creditors \nget paid. That is a win/win for everybody.\n  We have tried to strike the right balance. I think the legislation \nthat was offered by Senator Akaka was simply seen as unworkable and \nthat is why I opposed it. The concept is not bad; it is that the \nexecution of it would not be possible. We think this strikes a better \nbalance. If our colleagues can demonstrate that somehow or other this \nis impossible to do, we invite them to demonstrate that. We think it \nstrikes the right balance and yet achieves both of the objectives of \nhelping people keep their affairs straight and making sure all of the \ncreditors get paid.\n  We will have more to say, but I do only have a moment. I thank \nSenator Feinstein for her leadership on this issue, for bringing it to \nmy attention and for helping to pursue it today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator from Arizona for his \ncosponsorship on this amendment and also for his friendship as well.\n  We have talked about credit card debt increasing. Let me talk a \nlittle bit about what it is today. It has increased from about $251 \nbillion in 1990 to over $790 billion in the year 2000. That is an \nincrease of 300 percent.\n  There has been a dramatic rise in personal bankruptcies during these \nsame years. In 1990 there were 718,107 personal bankruptcies. In 2000 \nthat number had almost doubled to 1,217,972 personal bankruptcy \nfilings. In 2004 it went up again, to 1,563,145 personal bankruptcy \nfilings. Many of these personal bankruptcies are from people who get a \ncredit card. It looks alluring. They do not recognize what a 17-, 18-, \n19-percent interest rate can do. They pay just the minimum payment. \nThey pay it for 1 year, 2 years--they have something else, they get \nanother card, they get another card, they get another card, they do the \nsame thing.\n  They get 2 or 3 years down the pike and they find that the interest \non the debt is such that they can never repay these cards, and they do \nnot know what to do about it.\n  We say that the credit card companies have some responsibility. \nDuring the first 6 months of the minimum payment of the balance, the \ncredit card companies, under this amendment, would just put forward \nwhat they negotiated to put forward in California. There are a couple \nof options, and it is just really incremental debt sizes. If you have \n$1,000 worth of debt, and you make the minimum payment, this is what \nhappens. If you have $2,500 worth of debt or $5,000 worth of debt, this \nis what happens. So there is that scheme and that is in the underlying \nbill. Or another one, which is $250, $500, or $750 in debt.\n  After that, if the consumer makes only minimum payments for 6 \nconsecutive months, then this is where the bill comes in. The credit \ncard company is responsible for letting the individual know essentially \nhow much interest they have, and disclose in each subsequent bill the \nlength of time and total cost which is required to pay the debt plus \ninterest.\n  People have to know this. If they are a minimum-payment person, they \nhave to know what it means to make those minimum payments over a \nsubstantial period of time.\n  The amendment would also require that credit card companies be \nresponsible to put out a 800 number, included on the monthly statement, \nwhere consumers can call to get an estimate of the time it would take \nto repay their balance, if only making minimum payments, and the total \namount of those payments. If the consumer makes only minimum payments \nfor these 6 months they, then, receive the 800 number and they can \nbegin to get involved and understand it.\n  Senator Kyl pointed out the differences between our bill and the \nAkaka amendment. The underlying bill, as I said, provides only for \nbasic payment disclosure. The bill does not require credit card \ncompanies to disclose to card holders exactly how much each individual \ncard holder will need to pay, based on his or her own debt, if a card \nholder is only making minimum payments.\n  As I said, what we do is after 6 months of these basic minimum \npayments, then the credit card company must let the individual know: \nYou have X dollars remaining on your debt, the interest is Y, and your \npayout time will take Z, or whatever it is.\n  We think this is extraordinarily important. We believe it will \nminimize\n\n[[Page S1913]]\n\nbankruptcies. This, I suppose, is what I deeply believe. When companies \ncharge very substantial interest rates, they have an obligation to let \nthe credit card holder know what those minimum payments really mean, in \nterms of the ability of a minimum payment to completely pay back that \ndebt--how long it takes. I have people close to me I have watched, with \nsix or seven credit cards, and it is impossible for them, over the next \n10 or 15 years, to pay off the debt if they continue making just \nminimum payments. Therefore, they have to find a way to resolve that \ndebt. To date, you have two recourses.\n  One recourse is you go into a counseling center and they can \nrepackage all this debt for you and put it into one and somehow work \nout an agreement with the credit card company. I tried to do this for \nsomeone. As a matter of fact, the credit card company would not agree \nto any reduced payment. Or they go into bankruptcy.\n  These huge numbers of bankruptcy filings show that this is, indeed, a \nproblem. If we are going to have a bankruptcy bill, and I certainly \nsupport a bankruptcy bill, it is also important that the credit card \ncompanies play their role in disclosure. That disclosure is that if you \nmake a minimum payment, and your interest is 17, 18, 19 percent or even \n21 percent, here is what it means in terms of the length of time you \nwill be paying your bill and what it will take to pay that bill.\n  I think you will have people who are more cautious, which I believe \nis good for the bankruptcy courts in terms of reducing their caseloads, \nand also good for American consumers.\n  I join with Senators Kyl and Brownback in presenting this amendment, \nwhich is a kind of compromise to the Akaka amendment, in hopes that the \nSenate will accept it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). The Senator from Alabama is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank Senator Feinstein for her \ncomments. As I see it, we have probably a couple of little difficulties \nwith amending the Truth in Lending Act--the Banking Committee has \njurisdiction over that--how we will go forward. I do agree with the \nSenator from California that the plain fact is that credit card \ncompanies have an interest in getting reliable credit card holders not \nto pay on time--because they would be making 18 percent or whatever \npercent interest--if they are reliable people and they pay their debts. \nSo I think sometimes their disclosure is not clear enough on the \nminimum payment. They put the minimum payment in big print and the \ntotal amount due is printed small because I think sometimes they don't \nreally want people to pay it early. Some attention should be given to \nthat, and I would consider their amendment.\n  Let me repeat what we are about here. We have been hearing all day, \nvirtually, about health care bankruptcies as if this bankruptcy bill \ndoes not provide relief for people who have health care debts. It \ncertainly does. What we are about is to reform the procedure of Federal \nbankruptcy courts in America. All over this country there are Federal \ncourts, bankruptcy courts. They handle the petitions of people who have \nincurred debts that they say they are unable to repay. They would like \nto wipe out those debts, not owe anybody anything. Stop the phone \ncalls, stop the lawsuits--nada--not pay what they owe.\n  We provide for that. As has been stated before, the last numbers we \nhave, 1.6 million people have filed that way.\n  I would say without doubt that a number of those people who have \nfiled, quite a number, really needed that relief for whatever reason. \nThey got themselves in serious financial trouble. It is interesting \nthat people who manage their money well are very careful with how they \nspend. They don't run off and buy new cars. They take care of their \nmoney carefully. They don't usually end up in bankruptcy court--very \nseldom. Look around at your neighbors, the people you know who take \ncare. They don't overdress. They drive a modest car. They take care of \ntheir money. They are not filing bankruptcy.\n  Some of them get into trouble through no fault of their own, no \ndoubt. But I am just saying that.\n  There are advertisements all over America in newspapers and late \nnight TV and cable: Come on down. Wipe out your debts. You don't have \nto pay what you owe. Just come on and talk to old Joe, your good, \nfriendly bankruptcy attorney, and he will just wipe them all out.\n  Do you know what they tell them when they come in there? They say: \nTake out your credit card. I want you to take your paycheck that is \ncoming in now, you pay that to me, pay my fee, and you put everything \nelse on your credit card. Then when you are bankrupt you just wipe that \nout and you don't have to pay the credit card company.\n  That is the way it works. We know that. People are following the \nadvice of their lawyer. Lawyers are giving them advice based on what \nthe law allows them to do.\n  Mr. President, you are a lawyer. When you come in there, the law \nallows you to tell your client that is what they ought to do and it is \ngoing to save them money. Then they do it. It is not illegal. I guess \nit can't even be said to be unethical, because it is provided for under \nthe Federal bankruptcy law that we in this Senate are responsible for \ncreating, monitoring, and fixing when it is not working right. That is \nall I am saying. We are not here to deal with the uninsured on a \nbankruptcy reform bill. We are not here to fix all the language on bank \nlending and interest rate problems in America on a bankruptcy bill.\n  This legislation is now up for its fourth time in the Senate. We have \nalready had four markups in Judiciary over 8 years. It is basically the \nsame bill. It is time for us to have some reform. That is all we are \nsaying.\n  I want to talk about the health care debt. I hate to say it. We have \nhad some demagogic comments. You know, some of them have been down \nhere--not Senators Feinstein and Kyl--talking about credit card \ncompanies. When they give out money they are bad companies, as though \nthey are the evil forces. I know they have a profit interest. I know \nthey like to get that high interest rate. I know they are not unhappy \nif my mother sends in by mistake the minium payment rather than the \ntotal debt due when she probably would have paid the total debt due if \nshe could read those complicated forms. I am not saying they don't have \nan interest in making a profit. They do. But the very act of any credit \ncard company that provides money to Americans and then they don't pay \nit back, who is oppressing whom here? We have class warfare rhetoric \ngoing on such as the credit card companies ought to be blamed for \nproviding money to people who do not pay it back. That is just an \naside; not particularly valuable, I suppose, in the course of this \ndebate.\n  We are trying to create a system that allows us to fairly and \nresponsibly wipe out people's debt so they don't have to pay what they \nowe.\n  What about medical debt? If you have enough money to pay some of your \ndebt, let me ask you: Should you pay your doctor, should you pay your \nhospital, or those evil entities? If other people are getting paid \nmoney, ought not they to be paid? That is in some sense what is being \nsuggested here.\n  Let us take a look at what the deal is. This is to repeat, the deal \nis this: On this reform, people who file for bankruptcy who make above \nmedian income may be required by the bankruptcy court to pay at least a \nportion of what they owe based on their income as they show it to the \ncourt. If their income is below median income, they wipe out all their \ndebt, as they always have.\n  There is a growing concern in America that doctors, lawyers, high-\nincome people run up a bunch of debt, and they have decided they would \nrather wipe it out than to pay it back, and they go into bankruptcy \ncourt. Do you know they can do it? Now a person with a $200,000 a year \nsalary can have $100,000 in debt and go into bankruptcy court and wipe \nout those debts today and not pay any of it, be free and clear.\n  Under this bill, they would say, Wait a minute. Your income is high \nenough. Over 5 years is all they can be made to recompense the debt \nwhen they got money or services. We are going to scale out what we \nthink you can pay for at least 5 years so that those people you got \nmoney and services from will get something back. You don't get to wipe \nout all of your debt. That is what we are talking about.\n  What the experts have told us in the Judiciary Committee, of which I \nam a\n\n[[Page S1914]]\n\nmember, is that 80 percent of the people who file bankruptcy are below \nmedian income. Surprise, surprise. Most people who are filing \nbankruptcy have lower incomes. So 80 percent will not ever be in the \nhigher level and not be required to pay back any of their debt, whether \nthey are medical debts, gambling debts, automobile repair debts, \nwhatever those debts are. They won't be required to do that.\n  In addition, the bill provides for special circumstances, and the \ncourt can still not make them have to pay back any of it. The expert \nwitness we had in Judiciary Committee a few weeks ago said that based \non his opinion and what he has studied, he felt probably an additional \n7 percent would qualify there.\n  I submitted yesterday, and it was agreed to, the Sessions amendment \nto the bill that explicitly states health care can be a special \ncircumstance that would cause a person not to go into chapter 13 and \nthe court could find them to stay in chapter 7.\n  What Senator Kennedy's amendment would do is provide protection for \nthe rich. It would provide no protection, no benefit whatsoever for \npoor people--people making below median income. They do not get any \nbenefit out of it. He is providing an amendment that says somebody \nmaking $200,000 or $300,000 a year won't have to pay a dime to his \nlocal hospital; won't have to pay his doctor bills; won't have to pay \nhis pharmacy. Why? That is not right, in my view.\n  Not only that, it goes at the core of what this legislation is \nabout--trying to bring some balance into the system to treat poor \npeople fairly; let them wipe out a bit of their debt, and people with \nsome income to pay it back. The court would require them to pay some of \nthat back, depending on the level of that income. I think we need to \nthink about that.\n  Let me say this: I have been around this bill now since I have been \nin the Senate. There is a Professor Elizabeth Warren who has been \nabsolutely incredibly determined to defeat this bill. She has written \nop-eds, and she has distorted this legislation, in my view. She has not \naccurately stated the facts, and she has been given every opportunity. \nShe was allowed to testify at the last hearing which I referred to. I \nwant to comment on some things that I think are important which this \nprofessor ought to be aware of.\n  On the eve of our hearing, she announced this big, new survey that 54 \npercent of people in bankruptcy are in bankruptcy because of medical \nbills. Therefore, we ought to collapse, I suppose, and not have \nbankruptcy reform on that view.\n  Let me show you what the accurate numbers are.\n  Her study involved interviews of certain numbers of people; about \n1,700 people as I recall, 1,700 bankruptcy filers they surveyed. They \nhave a very broad definition of what a medical bankruptcy is. Whoever \nheard of a medical bankruptcy?\n  I see the Presiding Officer, an attorney from the State of Florida.\n  There are bankruptcies; you go into bankruptcy. This is not a medical \nbankruptcy. Medical debts are part of a debt you may owe. Maybe you \ndon't have any medical debt. But it is not medical bankruptcy. It is \nbankruptcy. According to the column on medical bankruptcy, her \ndefinition of medical bankruptcies is gambling debts, and alcohol and \ndrug abuse, in addition. So if you have alcohol, drugs, or gambling, \nshe counts that as a medical bankruptcy. That goes to show you the tilt \nin her report that she accounted with such great fanfare a few weeks \nago.\n  Now, interestingly, the Department of Justice, which operates the \nU.S. trustee system in 48 States--they work in the bankruptcy courts. \nThey monitor the bankruptcy courts. They try to watch out for fraud and \nabuse. They did a survey in 2000 to 2002 on medical cost as a factor in \nbankruptcy cases. They reviewed 5,203 chapter 7 cases from 48 States. \nOnly slightly more than 5 percent of unsecured debt reported in those \ncases was medically related from actually looking at their bankruptcy \nfiling.\n\n  When you file bankruptcy, you fill out a form. You ask the court to \nwipe out these debts so you do not have to pay them, and you list your \ndebts. If you do not list a debt, the court cannot wipe it out. \nEveryone today who chooses to file chapter 7 can wipe out their debts, \nbut they have to list them. All we have to do to determine how much of \nthe total existing debt is based on medical is to look at the files. \nThat is what the U.S. Trustee did. They found 5 percent of the total \ndebt was medically related. They also revealed in their study that 54 \npercent of the cases listed had no medical debts whatever. Fifty-four \npercent did not mention any medical bill--not a $25 bill to the doctor \nor a $50 bill to the pharmacist.\n  They noted that those who did have medical debts--and it has been \nsuggested that Americans are crushed under huge medical bills; \nsometimes that happens, I do not deny that--they found that 90 percent \nof the cases that did have medical debts reported debts of less than \n$5,000. If you are making $75,000 or $80,000 a year, you might be able \nto pay back part of that $5,000. So why shouldn't they pay back a \nportion of that cost? Even in those cases where a medical debt was \nlisted on their petition for bankruptcy, the medical debts only \naccounted for 13 percent of the total unsecured debt for those files.\n  That is a completely different picture than what we have been hearing \ntoday. This is a completely different picture, I submit, than we have \nbeen hearing from Professor Warren, who has opposed bankruptcy reform \nfor any reason she can conjure. I have read her statements, and they \nhave not been objective. This is another example of it. I don't \nappreciate it. She can say what she chooses. Senators can quote her \nnumbers all they want, but I believe those numbers from the U.S. \nTrustee Program based on review of actual bankruptcy filings where \ndebts have to be listed are accurate, far more accurate than the other.\n  Now, if you do have medical debts and those debts tip you over into \nbankruptcy--maybe you were getting by, and, bam, you have an $8,000 \nbill you cannot handle and you feel you have to go into bankruptcy. If \nyour income is below median income in America, you wipe out every bit \nof that debt. For 80 percent of the people, they will be able to do \nthat if that is what they choose. If they make above that higher income \nlevel and can pay back, according to the court, some of their hospital \ndebt, they ought to pay it back. I don't apologize for that. That is \nwhat we ought to do. That is what this bill strives to do.\n  As my amendment we passed yesterday explicitly states, if medical \ncauses are a problem and extraordinarily difficult, medical problems \ncan be a factor for the court to allow those with incomes even above \nmedian income to go into chapter 7 where you wipe out all your debts \nrather than chapter 13 where you pay back a portion.\n  Finally, chapter 13 has many good values. There are many things good \nabout chapter 13. This will shock some of my colleagues. In Alabama, \nthe latest reports I got from our bankruptcy judges are that around 50 \npercent of the filers in Alabama file under chapter 13. Why would they \nagree to pay back part of their debts? No. 1, they like paying back \ntheir debts. Like under chapter 7, the creditors can no longer call \nthem, they cannot be sued, and they cannot be harassed at their \nworkplace. Any lawsuits filed against them are stayed and stopped. The \nmoney is paid to the bankruptcy court. They pay out a percentage to \neach of the creditors based on the court's finding of how much each is \nentitled to get. They do this and work their way out of it, and they \nare happy. They are able to keep their automobile, often, and cram down \nthe value of it. Maybe they bought an automobile for $25,000 and they \nkept it 3 years. They went into bankruptcy, and it is now worth \n$15,000. When they recompute the numbers, they only have to pay back \n$15,000. They actually walk away from paying an obligation they \npromised the dealer or the bank. It may help them keep a home. There \nare a lot of reasons why lawyers who represent their clients think \nchapter 13 is not such a bad thing. In fact, it is in the interest of \nthe client.\n  Those people I refer to in Alabama who voluntarily choose chapter 13 \ncould choose chapter 7 without any hesitation if they thought it was \nbetter. Just because someone is moved into chapter 13 does not mean it \nis all bad. In fact, many people choose it for a variety of reasons.\n  Anyone with median income or below or even above who has extensive \nmedical bills will either be able to wipe\n\n[[Page S1915]]\n\nthem all out if they are below median income; if they are above median \nincome, they can be required to pay some of that debt back in monthly \npayments in a period not to exceed 5 years. That is fair. That is just. \nWho knows, it might help our hospitals keep their doors open instead of \nhaving to close.\n  I feel strongly about this bill. Every issue that has come up now has \ncome up previously. It is time to move forward. Let's get this bill \ndone, complete this work, and help improve the integrity of the \nbankruptcy system.\n  It also provides tremendous benefits for women and children. They \nhave a much higher priority in bankruptcy for alimony and child \nsupport. It eliminates the obstructive use of bankruptcy court to block \nevictions, eliminates a lot of other abuses, and contains some attorney \nfees in ways that have not been good in the past. There is a lot that \nis helpful that will streamline our system and make it better.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I listened with some interest to my \ncolleague and his description of the bankruptcy bill. I have felt for \nsome long while, and have voted that way in the Senate, that the \npendulum swung a bit too far in bankruptcy and needed to be adjusted \nsome. I believe the last time we voted in the Senate was 5 years ago.\n  But I am concerned there is an effort on the floor of the Senate to \nturn back every single amendment that is being offered, believing that \nthe only body of thought that has any merit at all is that which came \nout of the committee; that all of the proposals that are offered on the \nfloor of the Senate somehow are without merit; that the adjustments or \nthe approaches that might be helpful to some people who are more \nvulnerable are provisions without merit.\n  They may find, it seems to me, if they turn back all of these \namendments, that there might not be so much support for the bankruptcy \nbill as there has been in the past.\n  Let me talk for a moment about this issue of credit cards. My \ncolleague just spoke about the credit card companies. First of all, let \nme admit, I think there have been abusive bankruptcies. There is no \nquestion about that. It is one of the reasons I believe the pendulum \nwas swung a bit too far and probably should be brought back a bit. But \nthere are two sides to all of this as well.\n  We have credit card companies these days that blizzard this country \nwith credit cards, wall to wall. Go to a college campus and take a look \nat every mailbox. Credit card companies want to offer credit cards to \npeople who have no income and no jobs. They say: Take our credit card. \nTake a second credit card. Take a third and a fourth.\n  My son was age 10 when he got a preapproved credit card, a submission \nfrom Diners Club. He was 10 years old. So I called Diners Club. I said: \nIt's a good thing I got ahold of it before my son did. He would have \nprobably been in France.\n  I guess a 10-year-old couldn't travel. But the fact is, he probably \nwould have been interested in doing something with that credit card.\n  They said: Well, it was a mistake.\n  It was not a mistake. And it is not just Diners Club. Go through the \nwhole list of credit cards. It is not a mistake that they are sending \ncredit cards to people who have no income, people who have no jobs, \npeople who do not have a prospect of income. Do you know why it is not \na mistake? Because they take these giant mailing lists and they ship \nthese preapproved credit cards to everybody, understanding that some \npeople are going to get them who should not get them, and they won't \npay, and so they will just figure out how to deal with all that with \nhigher charges to everybody else, and at some point they will get \nrelief from Congress, even, on bankruptcy issues.\n  It is not just credit cards. Go down the street someday and see the \npicture window that beckons you, in big red color type, that says: Hey, \ncome over here. Buy our product. We'll give you a zero-percent interest \nrate until next August. Before you get home, we will send you a rebate \ncheck. Come on, buy it. It doesn't matter whether you can afford it or \nnot, buy our product.\n  Turn on the television set in the morning and hear the advertisement \nfrom the company that says: Bad credit? Come and see us. You have not \nbeen paying your bills? You have a problem on your credit report? Come \nand see us. We have credit available for you.\n  So there are two sides to all of this as well. Those who are \nblizzarding and papering this country with credit cards and debt, those \nwho know better, even as they do it, ought not come to this Congress \nand say: Well, now we have some problems. Now we have some defaults. We \nwant you to tighten the bankruptcy laws.\n  I think if the majority decides that in every circumstance every \namendment that is going to be offered in the Senate on these issues is \ngoing to be turned away, perhaps they will not have the robust vote on \nbankruptcy reform they expect.\n\n\n                            Social Security\n\n  Mr. President, I think this issue of bankruptcy in some ways ties to \nanother very significant issue that we are debating in the Congress and \nwill be debating across the country for months; this issue of Social \nSecurity. There are so many millions of Americans--tens of millions of \nAmericans--often women, often in their seventies, eighties, and \nnineties, often living alone, whose only source of income is a Social \nSecurity payment each and every month. It is the difference between \ntheir ability to live, to eat food, to buy prescription drugs, to pay \nrent, and their not having the ability to do those things.\n  You go back to 1935, when Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed the Social \nSecurity bill. Fifty percent of America's senior citizens who reached \nretirement age were living in poverty. In this great country of ours, \none-half of our elderly were living in poverty.\n  What a wonderful country this is in which to live. There is no \nquestion about that. We share this globe with 6 billion people--6 \nbillion of them. It is only us who have the opportunity to live in this \ncountry. Six billion people are our neighbors. One-half of them have \nnever made a telephone call. One-half of them live on less than $2 a \nday. A billion and a half people do not have access to clean, potable \nwater every day. We are lucky enough to live here.\n  But just think, 70 years ago, in this great country, as we were \nbuilding and creating and expanding our country, one-half of the people \nwho reached retirement age were living in poverty. They helped build \nthis country. They worked hard. They went to work every day. They did \nnot complain. They did the best they could and reached that period of \ntheir lives where they had a declining income situation because they \nwere not working anymore. They were retired and living in poverty.\n  Well, this country did something about that, and it ought to be proud \nof it. Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed a bill called Social Security. \nYes, the same people who are now skeptical about Social Security back \nthen attacked him unmercifully. Social Security was decried as creeping \nsocialism. It was decried as Government interference. The fact is, the \nSocial Security Program created an insurance program that all workers \npaid into for the purpose of providing a stable insurance policy upon \nretirement that would always be there, a guaranteed benefit upon \nretirement that you could count on. And like that, the poverty rate \namong America's senior citizens went from 50 percent to now slightly \nless than 10 percent.\n  This program has lifted tens of millions of Americans out of poverty. \nIt has worked, and worked well. And as this Congress now talks about \nbankruptcy legislation, let us talk about the issue of that which has \nprevented so many people from having to file bankruptcy, and that is \nthe Social Security Program that has provided stable, predictable, \nconsistent, and dependable revenue from an insurance program when \npeople retired from their jobs. It has worked, and worked well for over \n70 years.\n  There were some who did not like it in the 1930s and 1940s. They were \naggressively opposed to Social Security. Their ideas live on even \ntoday. They would like to take the Social Security system apart because \nthey believe it is, in the words of one of the far right conservatives, \nthe ``soft underbelly of the liberal welfare state.'' Those are his \ndirect words.\n\n[[Page S1916]]\n\n  In 1978, President George W. Bush ran for Congress in Texas, and he \nsaid: Social Security will be broke in 10 years. So in 1978, President \nBush said Social Security would be flat busted in 10 years, by 1988. Of \ncourse, he was not accurate. But he said back then we should go to \nprivate accounts in Social Security.\n  Now, all that says to me is that this is not about economics for this \nPresident. It is about philosophy. I am not critical of him for that. \nHe has every right to believe the Social Security system is somehow \nunworthy, ought to be taken apart, that it ought to be changed to a \nsystem of private accounts. The President has the right to believe \nthat. He believed it back in 1978, and he manifested that belief even \nnow as President.\n  But let's understand, then, that this is not about economics, it is \nabout philosophy. In fact, there is a memorandum dated January 3, which \ncomes from the chief strategist in the White House about Social \nSecurity, and let me quote from it. This is from Peter Wehner, who is \nthe chief strategist in the White House on Social Security planning:\n\n       I don't need to tell you that this will be one of the most \n     important conservative undertakings of modern times.\n\n  Interesting, isn't it? The first paragraph describes what is \nhappening in the President's proposal, about Social Security as ``one \nof the most important conservative undertakings of modern times.'' And \nif accomplished, it will be ``one of the most significant conservative \ngoverning achievements ever.'' Again, describing this issue as a \n``conservative undertaking.'' Its success is a ``conservative governing \nachievement.'' And then he connects it to the commitment to the \nownership society, control for individuals over their own lives, and so \non.\n  He says:\n\n       If we borrow $1-2 trillion to cover transition costs--\n\n  That is the first place this shows up, which is an acknowledgment \nthat everybody understands, that the President never talks about, that \nin order to go to transitions to private accounts, you have to borrow \nmoney--$1 to $2 trillion. That would be borrowing money on top of the \nlargest debt this country has ever experienced. We have the largest \nfiscal policy deficit in history. We have the largest trade deficit in \nthe history of this country right now. On top of that, the President \nwould propose a $1 to $3 trillion--this says $2 trillion--but $1 to $3 \ntrillion borrowing in order to set up private accounts. It is: Borrow \nmoney, put it in the stock market, cut benefits in the underlying \nSocial Security Program--I will get to that in a moment in this \nmemorandum--and hope that somehow it will all come out all right.\n  Let me read what is the most telling piece in the White House \nmemorandum about the Social Security plan:\n\n       For the first time in six decades, the Social Security \n     battle is one we can win. . . .\n\n  It is clear what he is saying. The White House memorandum of the \nstrategy, No. 1, in the front end calls it a conservative undertaking, \nnot just some policy debate about something that will strengthen the \ncountry, a conservative undertaking. Then he said:\n\n       For the first time in six decades, the Social Security \n     battle is one we can win. . . .\n\n  What is that battle? Go back to Alf Landon in the 1930s, who decried \nSocial Security, and bring it back every decade since; the fact is that \nthere are those who have never wanted Social Security, never liked \nSocial Security, believe it is some sort of Government intrusion in \npeople's lives and they have always wanted to basically get rid of it. \nThat is the battle.\n  The White House says:\n\n       For the first time in six decades, the Social Security \n     battle is one we can win. . . .\n\n  Well, who wins when we decide to begin taking apart one of the most \nsuccessful things that we have ever done in our history to lift people \nout of poverty? When you work you pay an insurance premium in your \npaycheck. It is called FICA and the ``I'' is for insurance. That is \nwhat it stands for. You put it in this fund, and when you retire, \nSocial Security payments will be there for you. They don't belong to \nsomeone else, they belong to you. They are yours. And it is not just \nthe old age benefit or the retirement benefit. If along the way you are \ndisabled, there are disability benefits. If along the way the principal \nwage earner dies and you have children under the age of 18, there are \nsurvivor benefits. All of that is available to those workers who are \npaying these premiums month after month.\n  It is really interesting and--for me at least--a bit disturbing that \nwe have turned in this country to a debate about me, me, me, and me: \nWhen is it my turn? How about me? Forget about the other guy, how about \nme?\n  I think both political parties contribute to this country. The notion \nof self-reliance, coming from the pioneers on the homestead, breaking \nsod, building log cabins, rolling up their sleeves, doing for \nthemselves, herding cattle on the open range, hard work every day, \nself-reliance, I understand all that. It is a wonderful ethic that \nhelped build this country. But there is more than that, much more than \nthat because those pioneers on the prairie, the pioneers who \nhomesteaded the prairies where I come from in southwestern North Dakota \nknew there was more than self-reliance and rolling up your sleeves and \nhandling it yourself. It was also about building a community, building \nyour churches and roads and schools and building the rural electric co-\nops to move electricity to the farms. It was about fighting things that \nwere more than just yourself, being a part of something bigger than \nyourself, fighting for women's rights, worker rights, for equal rights, \nfor minority rights. All of that is also a part of the legacy that has \nimproved this country and lifted it.\n  Now we come back to this mantra almost every day--centered now around \nSocial Security--what about me, what about mine. I want mine right now.\n  The Social Security system in many ways is a compact between the \ngenerations. It is a compact from my kids to me to my parents and has \nbeen for over 70 years. Some people say: Compacts don't matter. \nPromises don't matter. None of this matters. What matters is what is \nme, mine, right now, ownership.\n  I don't know. I wonder sometimes if this country would be the kind of \ncountry it is if that attitude prevailed in every circumstance. There \nare things that we do alone that represent initiative and self-reliance \nthat are very important, that represent the incentive to build and to \ndo better, the incentive for success. But there are other things \nequally important that represent the things we do together that have \nhelped build a great society, helped build great communities of \ninterest and helped pull each other up as a society. To sacrifice one \nfor the other injures opportunities in this country's future.\n  I have never quite understood if there is someone in this Chamber who \nbelieves there is something more important than their kids. I guess \nnot. Most of us would aspire to do anything for our children. We love \nour children. We want life to be better for our children.\n  But following that, we also believe that when our parents reach that \nperiod in their life where we call them elderly and they have less \nincome than they used to have and less ability to meet their daily \nneeds and to pay for the high cost of prescription drugs and pay the \nrent and buy the groceries, all the things they are required to do, \nthat we want to reach out and help them. We believe helping our parents \nand our grandparents is something that is important as a part of this \ncountry's responsibilities. That is what the Social Security system has \nbeen about.\n\n  We are going to have a lot of discussion about Social Security, and \nit is going to go from coast to coast. The President has a big old \nairplane, a 747, a big fat one with a hump on the nose. He has \nunlimited fuel, and good for him. I respect him. He is our President. \nHe has a right to believe as he does on these issues. He is going to \nsell this all across the country. But we, too, have an opportunity and \na responsibility. I believe strongly that what we have done to build \nopportunity has included the creation of a Social Security system that \nI know works.\n  Our late colleague, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Moynihan used to say \nthat everyone is entitled to his own opinion, but not to his own facts. \nMy hope is as the President travels around the country, and as we \ndebate here in the Congress, my hope is that we can agree on the basic \nset of facts.\n  The facts are contrary to the President's assertion in the State of \nthe\n\n[[Page S1917]]\n\nUnion Address. In the year 2018, the Social Security system will not be \ntaking in less money than it spends. That was the allegation the \nPresident made. Not true, just flat not true. According to Social \nSecurity actuaries, if we have a very low rate of economic growth, much \nbelow that which we experienced in the previous 75 years, if we have \nthat low rate of economic growth, by the year 2042, we will have less \nrevenue coming in to the Social Security system from both payroll taxes \nand accrued interest on the assets than we will need to be paying out. \nThe Congressional Budget Office says that year is 2052. That is almost \na half century from now.\n  Pick the one you like. In any event, we do not have a crisis in \nSocial Security. It is not going to take major surgery or a major \nadjustment to make Social Security whole for the long term. Our job \nought to be to work together to find a way to strengthen and preserve \nSocial Security for the long term and then strengthen and improve on \nthe other two elements of retirement security. One is pensions, and \nthat is to encourage more employers to offer pensions because only half \nof American workers are now covered. The second is private investment \naccounts such as IRAs and 401(k)s outside of Social Security and \npensions.\n  We can, should, and--I hope--will do much more in incentivizing those \nkinds of investments. But job No. 1 for us ought to be to preserve the \nbasic Social Security system. We can do that. We surely will do that. \nBut first we have to turn back the philosophy of those who write \nmemorandums from the White House and who are the chief strategists, who \ncreate the White House plan on Social Security, who say:\n\n       For the first time in six decades, the Social Security \n     battle is one we can win. . . .\n\n  Meaning they have never liked it. They didn't support it in the first \nplace, and they would love to begin taking it apart first by creating \nprivate accounts; second by, in this memorandum, describing the change \nin indexing which will cut everyone's benefit in the Social Security \nProgram.\n  I wanted to make one additional comment. I understand some colleagues \nare waiting. I intend to offer an amendment on the bankruptcy bill--\nhopefully tomorrow morning--that deals with something extraneous to \nbankruptcy but an issue that is important and timely.\n  At a hearing this morning, the Defense Department told me we are \nspending $4.9 billion a month in Iraq and Afghanistan. The \nadministration has included zero in its next year's budget for that \npurpose. But they are asking for an emergency supplemental to fund it.\n  I have held hearings--my colleague from Illinois has attended those, \nand I believe my colleague from Florida has as well--on the subject of \ncontracting in Iraq. There is massive waste, fraud, and abuse going on. \nI will describe a couple of things that have been testified to. \nSomebody orders 50,000 pounds of nails to be sent to Iraq for \nconstruction contracts. It turns out they are the wrong size. You know \nwhat happens? They are dumped on the ground--50,000 pounds of nails on \nthe ground in Iraq that are the wrong size. People driving $85,000 \nbrand new trucks. If they run out of gas or something happens to them, \nthey leave the truck and let somebody torch it. Halliburton is alleged \nto be billing us for serving 42,000 meals a day to our soldiers when, \nin fact, they are only serving 14,000 meals. They are overbilling us by \n28,000 meals a day. It is unbelievable, the massive waste, fraud, and \nabuse going on.\n  At a hearing a couple of weeks ago, we had people with pictures that \nshowed they have massive cash in vaults and they say if you are going \nto pay contractors, tell them to bring a bag and we will fill it with \ncash. We are talking about the massive wasting of taxpayers' money \ngoing to these sole-source contracts for billions of dollars and nobody \ncares.\n  My colleague from Illinois introduced a piece of legislation last \nyear on this subject. I talked to him yesterday about an amendment I \nwanted to introduce on this bill and am going to introduce in the \nmorning, and he will join me. This is a very important issue.\n  I am happy to yield to the Senator for a question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like the people following this \ndebate to understand what is being said. We have spent billions of \ndollars on the war in Iraq, and I voted for every penny of it. If it \nwere my son or daughter over there, I would give them everything they \nneeded to get their mission accomplished and come home safely. I ask \nthe Senator from North Dakota, how many official committee hearings and \ninvestigations have there been in Congress looking into the sole-\nsource, multibillion-dollar contracting the Senator has referred to?\n  Mr. DORGAN. My understanding is, I believe there was only one in the \nHouse, and the bulk of that was to defend the company called \nHalliburton--and there were no such hearings by the standing committees \nin the Senate. Essentially, there has been no interest in looking at \nthis kind of abuse. The Senator from Illinois was at a DPC hearing we \nheld. We had a guy there who used to purchase towels. He purchased hand \ntowels for soldiers. He held up the towels. He showed us that they are \nnearly three times the price of the towels they purchased for U.S. \nsoldiers. Why? Because the company wanted its logo on the towel. So \nthey buy a towel with a company logo on it for the soldiers and nearly \ndouble-bill the American taxpayer. This is a small issue in itself, but \nit is an example of what is going on, pervasively.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will yield for another question, the \namendment he is going to offer, which I have worked on as well and am \nhonored to join him as a cosponsor, is modeled after the Truman \nCommission that was created during World War II. Isn't it true that \nHarry Truman, a Democratic Senator from Missouri, initiated this \ninvestigation into what he called profiteering during the war at the \nexpense of soldiers and taxpayers, and was literally examining the \npractices of a Democratic President, Franklin Roosevelt, with that \ncommission, so that here he was, a Democrat, saying he had a higher \nresponsibility to the taxpayers and soldiers. He was going to \ninvestigate the activities of the War Department under a Democratic \nPresident. I ask the Senator, was that not the case?\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator from Illinois is correct. President Truman \ngot in his car, as a matter of fact, and began driving around the \ncountry to military installations to see what was going on. He came \nback and said there is something rotten here; a massive amount of waste \nis going on. He convinced Congress to create the Truman Commission, \nwhich was an investigative committee. And he was a Democrat, and there \nwas a Democrat in the White House, but that didn't stop him from \ninvestigating.\n  In this circumstance today, we have a Republican in the White House, \nRepublicans controlling the House and Senate, and they have no interest \nin doing any oversight hearings. Our colleagues asked the committee: \nWill you do an oversight hearing on the issues? The answer is no. I \nhave additional examples. How about $7,500 a month rent for an SUV in \nIraq? How about Halliburton charging a dollar more for every gallon of \ngas, compared to what the Department of Defense could have obtained \nfrom its own supply office? How about two guys who show up in Iraq \nhaving no money and very little experience and decide they are going to \nbe contractors? They decide to bid on contracts, and they win one. \nSomebody delivers a suitcase full of $2 million in cash and they are \noff and running. They soon got over $100 million in contracts. Some of \ntheir employees became whistleblowers because they said what was going \non was crooked. These people were taking forklift trucks off an airport \nthey were supposed to secure, taking them to a warehouse and repainting \nthem and selling them back. They sold them to the Coalition Provisional \nAuthority. Who is that? The American taxpayer. The Justice Department \nsays it won't join in a false claims action because defrauding the \nCoalition Provisional Authority in Iraq is not the same as defrauding \nthe American taxpayers. It is unbelievable, the lengths to which some \nof these people will go to avoid looking truth in the eye.\n\n  There is massive waste, fraud, and abuse. Billions of dollars is \nbeing abused and wasted and nobody seems to give a whit about it. \nSenator Durbin\n\n[[Page S1918]]\n\nfrom Illinois introduced legislation, which I was happy to support, in \nthe last Congress on this subject. I don't believe that got a hearing \nand certainly didn't get to the President's desk. My sense is that in \nany way we can, in every way we can, on behalf of the American \ntaxpayer, we need to do this. It undermines our support for American \nsoldiers if we don't have oversight. Do you think American soldiers \nwant to be stuck in Iraq doing what their country asked them to do only \nto find out that those serving them meals are overbilling by 28,000 \nmeals a day, or are double-charging for hauling gasoline in? This makes \nno sense. The minute you raise any of these things with the one party \nin this town, they say you are being totally partisan. Well, no, I \nthink we are being a little bit like Harry Truman here. He had the guts \nto look truth in the eye and say when something going on is rotten, \nwhen the American taxpayers are being bilked, tax money is being \npilfered, somebody ought to stand up and stop it.\n  I intend to offer this amendment in the morning. I am proud of the \nwork my colleague has done as well. I have spoken longer than I \nintended. The Senator from Florida wishes to speak. Let me say that I \nwill be back in the morning to offer this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe pending amendment be temporarily laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 37\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. Nelson] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 37.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nfurther reading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To exempt debtors from means testing if their financial \n                problems were caused by identity theft)\n\n        At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. IDENTITY THEFT.\n\n       (a) Definition.--Section 101 of title 11, United States \n     Code, as amended by this Act, is further amended--\n       (1) by redesignating paragraph (27B) as paragraph (27D); \n     and\n       (2) by inserting after paragraph (27A) the following:\n       ``(27B) `identity theft' means a fraud committed or \n     attempted using the personally identifiable information of \n     another person;\n       ``(27C) `identity theft victim' means a debtor who, as a \n     result of an identify theft in any consecutive 12-month \n     period during the 3-year period before the date on which a \n     petition is filed under this title, had claims asserted \n     against such debtor in excess of the least of--\n       ``(A) $20,000;\n       ``(B) 50 percent of all claims asserted against such \n     debtor; or\n       ``(C) 25 percent of the debtor's gross income for such 12-\n     month period.''.\n       (b) Prohibition.--Section 707(b) of title 11, United States \n     Code, as amended by section 102(a) of this Act, is further \n     amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(8)(A) No judge, United States trustee (or bankruptcy \n     administrator, if any), trustee, or other party in interest \n     may file a motion under paragraph (2) if the debtor is an \n     identity theft victim.''.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I want to make sure and will \nask unanimous consent, if need be, that both Senators Durbin and \nSchumer are listed as cosponsors of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They are currently listed as cosponsors.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, as we debate the merits on this bankruptcy bill, I \noffer an amendment, and I believe it is critical to improving this \npiece of legislation. This amendment will create an exemption from the \nrequirements of this bankruptcy bill for victims of identity theft. The \nlong and short of the amendment is, if you have had your identity \nstolen and charges have been run up on you because your identity was \nstolen, and if that causes you to go into bankruptcy, then you are \ngoing to have an exemption from the provisions of this legislation that \nsaid you would not be able to file bankruptcy.\n  It is carefully tailored as an amendment. It would not apply to every \nsingle identity theft victim. Rather, it would require identity theft \nvictims to show they were defrauded out of the minimum dollar amount.\n  There is an epidemic of identity theft that has plagued millions of \nAmericans. There are 60 Senators in this Chamber who had Bank of \nAmerica Government credit card information lost or stolen over the \nweekend. 1.2 million other Americans, including this Senator from \nFlorida, had personal financial information that was lost or stolen. In \nmy particular Senate office, two other of our senior staff members had \nsensitive financial account information that was compromised in this \nincident. The lost data tapes could have names, Social Security \nnumbers, and addresses on them.\n  How long down the road before we find that our Social Security \nnumbers and other personally identifiable privileged financial \ninformation come into the hands of the thief to be used in stealing our \nidentity, and we suddenly start finding we have charges we never made.\n  This phenomenon of identity theft is happening. We saw it in a big \ncase called ChoicePoint, an Atlanta, GA, company that had hundreds of \nthousands of records purloined as a result of someone disguised as a \nregular customer of that information broker, and instead their \nidentities are now stolen. Mr. President, 10,000 of those 400,000 \nstolen we know are in the State of Florida--at least 10,000. This is a \nphenomenon that is continuing to occur.\n  Identity thieves typically take advantage of the electronic records \nto steal people's names, addresses, telephone numbers, Social Security \nnumbers, bank account information, or other personal, financial, and \nmedical data.\n  If you were a customer of something such as ChoicePoint, an \ninformation broker, not only do you have information, such as your \ncredit, which is covered under existing law for protection, but you \nhave a lot of other information in there, such as I mentioned, Social \nSecurity numbers and bank accounts. What about job applications, what \nabout drivers' licenses, what about DNA tests, what about the records \nof all kinds of different medical tests?\n  This is the alarming theft that is occurring today, and it is not \nbeing done with the hammer and crowbar of a typical thief. It is being \ndone by sophisticated methods as we are living in this technological \nage.\n  Listen to these alarming statistics. The Federal Trade Commission \nsays 10 million Americans were affected by identity theft last year. \nIdentity theft is now the most common fraud perpetrated on consumers. \nIn 2004, identity theft accounted for 39 percent of consumer fraud \ncomplaints, the Federal Trade Commission tells us. And a figure that \nwill blow your mind is that identity theft cost the United States $52 \nbillion last year.\n  Because identity thieves misuse people's personally identifiable \ninformation, some individuals are denied jobs, they are arrested for \ncrimes they did not commit, or they face enormous debts that are not \ntheir own.\n  Last week, in Orlando, I met with six of those victims of identity \ntheft. One of them was an elderly mother who was there with her \ndaughter who, upon the passing of her husband of half a century, the \ndaughter taking over all the financial records, and paying her mother's \nbills--her mother had always provided for the children's needs, so when \nthe daughter started getting these credit card bills on the mom's \ncredit card of $5,000 and $10,000, she paid them. It was not until a \nstore owner in California, on the other side of the country from where \nthis couple lives in Coca, FL, an alert store owner called and said: We \nwant to make sure that you are willing to have this charge of $26,000 \ncharged to your mother's credit card. Your mother is standing right \nhere in the store in San Francisco to ring up this charge. The \ndaughter, of course, replied: My mother is sitting right here with me \nin Florida. Obviously, someone is masquerading as my mother with a \nstolen identity.\n\n  The sad result is that even though that $26,000 charge was averted, \nthe daughter had already paid what she thought were the legitimate \ndebts of\n\n[[Page S1919]]\n\nher mom to the tune of $40,000, and because of that stolen identity, \nshe can never get that back.\n  What happens if that is a debt that would drive a person like that \ninto bankruptcy? Should that be used against them to prevent them from \nbeing able to have bankruptcy? I do not think we want to do that in \nthis legislation.\n  The law does not require creditors to automatically erase a person's \ndebt arising from identity theft. Creditors sometimes refuse to erase \nthese debts or they allow credit investigations to drag on for years. \nThis leaves some identity theft victims with no choice but to file for \nbankruptcy.\n  Let me give some more examples.\n  Last year, a Pennsylvania woman was victimized by a brazen identity \ntheft. This thief was actually renting a room in the lady's house. The \nidentity thief stole her checks, her bank card, her personally \nidentifiable financial information. Then the thief used that \ninformation to wipe out the lady financially. One month before \nChristmas, this woman was forced to file for bankruptcy relief. \nShouldn't this bankruptcy reform bill cut people such as that some \nslack? I think that is the humane thing to do.\n  There is another example. It is in New York. An identity thief stole \nthe personal information of a girlfriend, and then he ran up huge debts \nin the victim's name. Pretending to be the victim, the identity thief \ntook out three personal loans and even purchased two automobiles. In \ntotal, the thief ran up a tab of over $300,000. The local postal \ninspector in the victim's area called it the worst case of identity \ntheft they had ever seen. In that case, the victim had no choice but to \nfile for bankruptcy.\n  Should not there be an exemption in a case like this? This is a very \nstraightforward amendment. It states that people who have been victims \nof identity theft and have to file for bankruptcy because of that \nidentity theft should get a break from the stringent means test in the \nbill. As identity theft becomes more prevalent--and it happened last \nweek with the revelation of ChoicePoint, an information broker, 400,000 \npeople. It could have happened Friday night after 5 when Bank of \nAmerica released the information that 1.2 million Federal employees' \nidentities had been stolen, including 60 Senators in this Chamber. As \nit becomes more prevalent, more innocent people are going to encounter \nthis situation.\n  I think it is only right to be fair to those victims when they file \nbankruptcy and not to add insult to their injury.\n  The Consumer Federation of America has endorsed this amendment as \nbeing in the best interest of Americans. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this amendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Of course, to the distinguished assistant \nDemocratic leader, I yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I must be living under a dark cloud because I not only \nhad my identity stolen several weeks ago, but I am also one of the 60 \nSenators who, like the Senator from Illinois, was a victim of this \napparent theft of a computer tape of official business credit cards of \nthe Senate which compromises our credit cards. In my situation 4 or 5 \nyears ago, I received a phone call from a collection agency in my home \nin Illinois saying: Durbin, we finally caught up with you. I do not \nknow if you thought you could get by with this forever. We knew we \nwould find you. You owe our company in Denver, CO, $2,000. I said: I \nhave never been to your company's place in Denver, CO. I have never \ndone business with you. It turned out to be someone using my name and \nmy Social Security number, who had run up several thousand dollars in \ncharges. It took several months to sort it out, but I was lucky. I \nsorted it out. There are some stories that have come to my office, and \nI am sure to the Senator's office as well, where it took years before \nthey finally came to the bottom of it.\n  So I ask the Senator from Florida, for those people who were victims \nof identity theft, maybe a credit card where charges were run up out of \nsight, tell me exactly what the Senator's amendment will do to protect \nthem in this new bankruptcy reform we are considering.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I thank the Senator for his question. Yes, the \nSenator may well be one of the victims that was not announced until \nafter work on Friday afternoon at 5, but we have identified that it is \n60 Senators in this Chamber, along with 1.2 million Federal employees. \nWe are talking about this credit card that is provided for official \nexpenses of Government business, and all your personally identifiable \ninformation is on that file. So it may well be that a majority of this \nSenate finds they could become the victims and experience the similar \nkind of agony of the six people I just met with in Orlando, that it \nkeeps going on and on and they cannot get their identity back.\n  I had one who was a truck driver with special permission to drive \nhazardous materials. His identity is stolen and there is somebody out \nthere driving a truck of hazardous materials who has stolen his \nidentity.\n  The Senator's specific question is: What does this amendment do? What \nit does is carve an exemption for the people who have debts that have \ndriven them into bankruptcy because those debts have occurred through \nno fault of their own. Their identity has been stolen and someone has \ncreated a credit card that then runs up bills in their name, that they \ndid not know about, they did not intend, nor could they afford, and as \na result, because they cannot get it worked out--and I wish the Senator \ncould hear these victims, how long it takes them to get their identity \nback--in a timely fashion, they have to file for bankruptcy.\n\n  My amendment says this is going to be an exception from all the \nrigors of the bill that say a person cannot file for bankruptcy.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I could further ask the Senator from Florida, this \nbankruptcy reform is going to affect millions of Americans. About 1 \nmillion to 1\\1/2\\ million a year file for bankruptcy, and all of their \nmembers of their family, of course, are affected by the bankruptcy so \nthese people filing for bankruptcy have reached a point where their \nbills are so large they have said: I cannot do it, it is far in excess \nof what I can ever pay off, and they go into bankruptcy court asking \nthat they have their debts relieved. They give up most of their assets \nin life and their debts are then paid off partially, as much as they \ncan, and they walk out of the bankruptcy court with a new day ahead of \nthem. That has been the law for a long time.\n  This bill we are considering says, wait a minute, we may not let you \nwalk out of the court with all of your debts behind you. You may walk \nout of the court with some of the debts still on your shoulders that \nyou have to keep paying. So if I understand the Senator's amendment, he \nis saying if the debts we are talking about were incurred not by the \nperson filing bankruptcy but in their name because of identity theft, \nthen for goodness sakes it should not be said at the end of the \nbankruptcy process that they still have to carry these debts which some \ncriminal has incurred in their name.\n  Is that my understanding of what the Senator is trying to achieve?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Indeed, the Senator has put his finger on the \nproblem and the attempted solution to the problem, recognizing that we \nwant to work with the banking industry and the credit card industry so \nthis does not become a loophole that somebody can get out of following \nthe law and be irresponsible about filing bankruptcy. We have even put \nit in the amendment that there has to be a threshold for the person who \nwould have this exemption because of identity theft. For example, it \nwould have to be a claim against the debtor in excess of $20,000, or 50 \npercent of all the claims asserted against the debtor, or 25 percent of \nthe debtor's gross income for a 12-month period.\n  With that reasonable protection, so that somebody is not abusing the \nlaw, we come back to the basic issue of fairness.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I could ask the Senator from Florida, yesterday we \nconsidered an amendment, which the Senator supported and cosponsored, \nwhich said take into consideration the members of the National Guard \nand Reserve who are being activated and sent overseas to Iraq and \nAfghanistan, risking their lives for America, that if they are gone for \na year or more they may have an\n\n[[Page S1920]]\n\neconomic misfortune; maybe that small business they were running fails \nbecause they are gone serving their country. So we offered an amendment \nyesterday which said when it comes to that bankruptcy situation we \nshould be more tolerant, more lenient and more sensitive to these men \nand women who have risked their lives serving America in the Armed \nForces.\n  When we offered that amendment the Senator from Florida may recall \nthat yesterday some 58 Senators voted against it, many of whom will be \nthe first to welcome these guardsmen and reservists with open arms, \nthank you for your service to our country. Now Senator Kennedy has an \namendment pending which says, what about the category of Americans who \nhave overwhelming medical bills because of a medical condition they \nnever could have anticipated and they get trapped in bankruptcy? Can we \ntake that into consideration and not hit them as hard as others and not \ntake their homes away from them at the end of the day? Now the Senator \ncomes in with another category, which I think is equally legitimate, of \nvictims of identity theft.\n  If I understand the Senator from Florida, he is following in the same \nline of argument, and that is the bankruptcy court should not be blind \nto reality, to the reality of the guardsmen and reservists serving our \ncountry and paying a heavy price at home in terms of their personal \nfinances. Nor should this bill be insensitive to a single mother \nraising children, diagnosed with breast cancer, who as a waitress with \nanother job cannot pay off her medical bills, or in the Senator's case \nan elderly person whose identity was stolen and charges were run up \nbeyond anything that she could handle.\n  It is my understanding that what you are saying is this law should be \nsensitive to the realities of people who are doing the right thing but \nare being victimized, either by medical illness or by identity theft. \nIs that the intention of the Senator?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. The Senator is correct. Indeed, this amendment \nis saying that under the circumstances, where a person, through no \nfault of their own, because they have been preyed upon by larceny, by a \nthief, and bills have been run up because their identity has been \nstolen, and that happens, tragic as it is, to cause them to go into \nbankruptcy, that they should be exempted the harsh means test provision \nof this bill and should be allowed to file Chapter 7 bankruptcy under \nthose circumstances. The stolen identity is enough. The debts run up \nare enough. The harassment of trying to get your identity back is \nenough. Lord help them, then when they have to file bankruptcy, that \nought to be enough. But to say that they cannot file Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy under this condition? What are we trying to do to our fellow \nAmericans? This amendment perfects that glaring error and \ninconsistency.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Florida for his \nleadership on this issue. I am happy to join him as a cosponsor. I \nwould like at this time to offer another amendment which I would like \nto describe.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 38\n\n  I ask the pending amendment be set aside, and I send an amendment to \nthe desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coburn). Without objection, it is so \nordered. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois (Mr. Durbin), proposes an \n     amendment numbered 38.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n          (Purpose: To discourage predatory lending practices)\n\n     SEC. 206. DISCOURAGING PREDATORY LENDING PRACTICES.\n\n       Section 502(b) of title 11, United States Code, is \n     amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (8), by striking ``or'' at the end;\n       (2) in paragraph (9), by striking the period at the end and \n     inserting ``; or''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(10) if the creditor has materially failed to comply with \n     any applicable requirement under section 129(a) of the Truth \n     in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. 1639(a)) or section 226.32 or \n     226.34 of Regulation Z (12 C.F.R. 226.32, 226.34), such claim \n     is based on a secured debt.''.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, there is hardly one of us who has not \nheard a story that goes as follows: An elderly widow is living in her \nfamily home. Her children have moved out. She is getting up in years, \nbut she is happy in her home, exactly where she wants to be. As time \ngoes on, life gets more complicated for her, and someone takes \nadvantage of her. There is a knock on the door and someone says to her: \nI just took a look at your roof. You must realize it is in terrible \ncondition, and luckily I do roofing. I will be happy to repair your \nroof. Or, if you put vinyl siding on this old house, you could save so \nmuch on your heating bill. Or, did you notice that your basement \nfoundation is starting to crack? That could be dangerous, and luckily I \ndo the work.\n  You hear the story over and over, that this person--I do not mean to \npick on elderly widows; it could be a widower, too--says: Sure, that \nsounds good. You seem like a nice, bright young man. Why doesn't your \ncompany come in and fix my house.\n  They say: Great. Here is a little contract we would like you to sign \nto have the home improvements.\n  They look at it and they say: It is tough for me to read it. I am not \na lawyer.\n  Trust me, it is a standard contract.\n  They sign on the dotted line.\n  You have heard this story. Maybe someone in your family has been \nthrough this. Then what happens. The work turns out to be shoddy. They \ndo not do what they are supposed to do. The charges are outrageously \nhigh. Then you take a look at the contract, and it turns out the \ncontract creates a lien on the property, perhaps another mortgage on \nthe property, perhaps a balloon payment, maybe interest rates that go \nright through the roof for the unsuspecting person. There are finance \ncompanies behind these door-to-door con artists who write out these \ncontracts and end up, when all is said and done, owning the home.\n  That is not an outrageous story I have told you. It is repeated over \nand over, day in and day out, in my home State of Illinois and around \nthe country. That is why I am proposing this amendment. This is called \npredatory lending. You know what a predator is: the animal that goes \nout trying to devour its prey. Predatory lenders do just that, too. \nThis amendment is designed to penalize the growing number of high-cost \npredatory mortgage lenders who lead vulnerable borrowers down the path \nto foreclosure and bankruptcy. It is about balance, something this \nbankruptcy bill desperately needs.\n  If we are going to change the bankruptcy laws because too many people \ngo to bankruptcy court, then we must also address predatory lending, \nwhich I have described, which is driving too many vulnerable Americans \ninto bankruptcy court. If we are going to make the door to the \nbankruptcy court harder for consumers to open, then we must also make \nsure we are not protecting predatory creditors that force consumers to \nknock on that door.\n  There is no uniformly accepted definition of predatory lending. It is \na lot like the old Supreme Court saying: I will know it when I see it. \nBut high-pressure consumer finance companies have cheated \nunsophisticated and vulnerable consumers out of millions of dollars \nusing a variety of abusive credit practices. Let me give examples of \nwhat they are: hidden and excessive fees and interest rates; lending \nwithout regard to the borrower's ability to pay; repeatedly refinancing \na loan over a short period of time without any economic gain, known as \nloan flipping; committing outright fraud and deception, such as \nintentionally misleading borrowers about the terms of the loan.\n  Some automobile lenders in the used car industry have gouged \nconsumers with interest rates as high as 50 percent with assessments \nfor credit insurance, repair warranties, and hidden fees, adding \nthousands of dollars to the cost of an otherwise inexpensive used car. \nPawn shops in some States have charged annual rates of interest of 240 \npercent or more. I could give you a lot more description of these \npredatory lending practices. Let me just tell you a few stories.\n  My colleagues who were listening to this debate know I have offered \nthis before. They are likely to say: Here\n\n[[Page S1921]]\n\ncomes Durbin again with the same old amendment. I am here again as I \nwas in a previous Congress because this problem is still with us today. \nThe last time I called up this amendment on debate on a bankruptcy bill \nwe lost by one vote. This problem has only become worse since Congress \ndefeated that amendment.\n  As predatory mortgage lending increases, it continues to target lower \nincome women, minorities, and older Americans. In 1998, Senator \nGrassley of Iowa, my friend and colleague and the author of the \nbankruptcy bill, held a hearing in the Senate Special Committee on \nAging looking into predatory lending. At the hearing, this is what a \nformer career employee of that industry had to say.\n  Listen to how he described his customers:\n\n       My perfect customer would be an uneducated woman who is \n     living on a fixed income, hopefully from her deceased \n     husband's pension and Social Security, who has her house paid \n     off, is living off credit cards but having a difficult time \n     keeping up her payments, and who must make a car payment in \n     addition to her credit card payments.\n\n  This witness acknowledged that unscrupulous lenders specifically \nmarket their loans to elderly widowed women, blue-collar workers, \npeople who have not graduated with higher education, people on fixed \nincomes, non-English speaking, and people who have significant equity \nin their homes.\n  That statement was made in 1998, 7 years ago. Six years later, \nFebruary 2004, the Special Committee on Aging held another hearing on \nthe same subject. At this hearing, held just 1 year ago, this is what a \nwitness from the Government Accountability Office said:\n\n       Consistent observational and anecdotal evidence, along with \n     limited data, indicates that for a variety of reasons, \n     elderly homeowners are disproportionately the targets of \n     predatory lending. Because older homeowners on average have \n     more equity in their homes than younger homeowners, abusive \n     lenders could be expected to target these borrowers and \n     ``strip'' the equity from their homes. The financial losses \n     older people can suffer as a result of abusive loan practices \n     can result in the loss of independence and security, \n     significant decline in the quality of life.\n\n  So has the problem of predatory lending gone away, as my opponents \nmight argue? No, it has gotten worse.\n  What else has been going on since we first considered this in the \nSenate?\n  The AARP Litigation Foundation, which files lawsuits to help seniors, \nhas been party to seven lawsuits since 1998 involving allegations of \npredatory lending against more than 50,000 elderly Americans. As of \nFebruary 2004, six of their lawsuits have been settled, and one is \nstill pending.\n  Minorities are still being targeted by these unscrupulous lenders as \nwell.\n  According to the Center for Responsible Lending, Hispanic Americans \nare two and a half times more likely than whites to receive a \nrefinancing loan from one of these lenders. African Americans are more \nthan four times more likely to be targeted.\n  Let me share a credible article from the Los Angeles Times of \nFebruary 2004 by Ameriquest, one of the largest subprime lenders. The \narticle includes a story about how they tricked a minority, Sara Landa, \nfrom East Palo Alto, CA. She speaks Spanish and limited English.\n  She entered into a settlement with one of these companies, \nAmeriquest. After that, it was alleged that Ameriquest employees \ntricked her into signing a mortgage that required her to pay almost \n$2,500 a month, far more than her income from cleaning houses. All the \nnegotiations were in Spanish. All the loan documents were in English. \nThe only thing she ever received from Ameriquest in Spanish was a \nforeclosure notice. It is amazing.\n  In this same article, you will find statements from many ex-employees \nof this company, Ameriquest, asserting that while they worked for this \ncompany they were engaged in improper and predatory practices.\n  Mark Bomchill, a former Ameriquest employee, said he left his job \nbecause he didn't like the way Ameriquest treated people. He said that \nthe drive to close deals and grab six-figure salaries led many of his \nfellow employees astray. Listen to what he said. He said:\n\n       They forged documents, hyped customer's credit worthiness \n     and ``juiced'' mortgages with hidden rates and fees.\n\n  Two other former employees said borrowers were often solicited to \nrefinance loans that were not even 2 years old. This happened even \nthough Ameriquest pledged in 2000 not to resolicit customers for at \nleast 2 years. They completely ignored that pledge.\n  Nearly one in nine mortgages made by Ameriquest last year was a \nrefinance on an existing loan less than 2 years old. The abuses don't \nend there.\n  Former Kansas City Ameriquest employees described another predatory \npractice by the same company where they would fabricate borrowers' \nincomes and falsify appraisals.\n  Lisa Taylor, a former loan agent from Sacramento, said she witnessed \ndocuments being altered as she walked around the vending machine that \npeople were using as a tracing board, copying borrowers' signatures on \nan unsigned piece of paper.\n  If you think these are isolated examples, exaggerated stories, let me \nrefer you to a 2004 GAO study that found that this is a prevalent \nproblem in the subprime mortgage industry--this predatory lending. They \nfound plenty of indications that predatory mortgage lending was a major \nand growing problem in the year 2004.\n  According to the 2004 study, in the past 5 years, there have been a \nnumber of major settlements resulting from government enforcement acts. \nI will mention a few.\n  Household International agreed to pay up to $484 million to \nhomeowners across America to settle allegations by States that it used \nunfair and deceptive lending practices.\n  In September 2002, Citigroup agreed to pay $240 million to resolve \nFTC and private party charges that Associates First Capital Corporation \nengaged in systematic and widespread abusive lending practices.\n  In March 2000, First Alliance Mortgage Company settled with the \nFederal Trade Commission, six States, and the AARP to compensate \nborrowers more than $60 million because of their deceptive practices to \nlure senior citizens. An estimated 28 percent of the 8,700 borrowers in \nthat suit were elderly.\n  These are documented. While some victims of predatory lending are \nlucky enough to receive compensation because of these lawsuits, many \nmore have fallen to predatory lenders, and they never can turn to our \nlegal system for help.\n  Here is an astonishing statistic. Mr. President, 1 in 100 \nconventional loans ends in foreclosure, but 1 in 12 subprime predatory \nloans ends in foreclosure. While it might be expected, these loans, \nbecause they are made with less creditworthy borrowers, would result in \nan increased rate of foreclosure, but the magnitude of the differences \ntells us that there is more at stake here than just the \ncreditworthiness of the borrower.\n  The Senate Banking Committee held a hearing in July 2001. At that \nhearing, a report from the Center for Responsible Lending was released \nwhich showed the predatory lending practices cost American borrowers an \nestimated $9.1 billion annually.\n\n  Let me tell you why I am offering this amendment. Imagine, if you \nwill, that it is your mother, father, grandmother, or grandfather alone \nin their home, and they signed this home improvement loan or signed \nthis refinancing, which you learn about months later. You say: Grandma, \nyou didn't tell me that you had somebody come in and do some work, and \nyou didn't tell me you signed these papers. Did anybody read them?\n  No. He seemed like such a nice man, and he told me it was a standard \nform.\n  And you take it over to your family attorney. He says: My goodness. \nWhat your grandmother signed here is a remortgage of the property. She \nowned the home, and now, by buying vinyl siding, she has remortgaged \nher property and promised to pay back just a few hundred dollars a \nmonth to start with, but in a matter of a year or two, it explodes. The \nballoon pops, and it turns into a $2,000-a-month payment.\n  How is she going to pay it? Let us assume the worst circumstance--she \ndoesn't pay. The mortgage is foreclosed on. She is about to lose her \nhome, and she files for bankruptcy. She has nothing left on this Earth \nexcept a Social Security check, maybe a little pension check, some \nsavings, or meager savings. She goes into bankruptcy court\n\n[[Page S1922]]\n\nto try to get out from under this burden. Guess who shows up at the \nbankruptcy court. The same predatory lender shows up saying: We own \nwhatever she owns. She signed this mortgage.\n  Is it fair? Is it fair for somebody to take in a legal document, a \npredatory mortgage, that takes advantage of elderly people, and then be \nprotected in the bankruptcy court? I don't think so.\n  If we are going to hold people coming into bankruptcy court who file \nfor bankruptcy to the high moral standard of paying back their debts, \nshould we not hold the creditors walking into bankruptcy court to a \nsimilar high moral standard that they must have followed the law, that \nthey must have engaged in this highly regulated, moral conduct?\n  The amendment I am offering prohibits a high-cost mortgage lender \nfrom collecting on its claim in bankruptcy court if the lender extends \ncredit in violation of existing law--the Home Ownership and Equity \nProtection Act of 1994, which is part of the Truth in Lending Act.\n  I am not reinventing the law. I am just saying when you issued this \nmortgage, you violated the law. You took advantage of a person by \nviolating the law. You cannot then go in court and say protect me with \nthe law. You can't have it both ways. If you broke the law to incur \nthis debt, you can't go in court and ask for the law to protect you to \ncollect the debt.\n  That seems to me to be just. If you were legal in the way you treated \nthis person, then you can use the law in enforcing your debt. If you \nwere illegal in the way you treated this person, you can't go into \ncourt and use the law to collect on that illegally based debt. That is \nsimple.\n  When an individual falls prey to lenders and files for bankruptcy \nseeking last resort help, the claim of the predatory lender will not be \nallowed against a debtor. If the lender failed to comply with the \nrequirements of the Truth in Lending Act for high-cost mortgages, the \nlender has no claim in bankruptcy court. The law has long recognized \nthe doctrine of unclean hands where a party to an illegal agreement is \nnot able to recover damages from other parties to such an agreement \nbecause the claimant itself was the party to an illegality.\n\n  My amendment is not aimed at all subprime lenders. The amendment will \nhave no impact whatever on honest lenders who make loans that followed \nthe law even if the loans carry high interest rates or high fees. \nInstead, it is directed solely at the bottom feeders, the scumbags, the \npredator lenders. My amendment reinforces current law and will help \nensure that predatory lenders do not have a second chance to victimize \ntheir customers by seeking repayment in a bankruptcy proceeding.\n  Second, this amendment is not aimed at technical violations of the \nTruth In Lending Act. The violations must be material. I specifically \nmade that change in my language to address some of the concerns raised \nin the first debate.\n  Third, the amendment does not amend the Truth In Lending Act. There \nis no question as to whether the Senate Banking Committee has any \njurisdiction. We do not change the Truth In Lending Act. I point out \nthe bankruptcy bill does amend that act in some parts. My amendment \nabsolutely does not.\n  Some may argue the amendment is unnecessary because current law is \nsufficient. I disagree. I recognize Congress has passed numerous laws \nthat Federal agents and regulators have used to combat predator \nlending, but predatory lending is on the rise. Many Americans are being \ncheated and duped by these unscrupulous business people.\n  President Bush has attempted to promote home ownership as part of the \nvision of an ownership society. I applaud him. For my wife and me, the \nfirst time we purchased a home was a turning point in our lives. We \nstarted to look at the world a lot differently. This was our home, on \nour block, in our neighborhood, in our town. It is an important part of \neverybody's life. I support that. But unless we rein in the abusive \nbehavior of some in the lending industry, we will be promoting not an \nAmerican dream, but an American nightmare for thousands of homeowners.\n  Let me say one more word. The last time I offered this amendment, the \nmost stunning thing I learned was that the major financial institutions \nin America, the big boys, the blue chips, the best in the industry, \noppose my amendment. You think, wait a minute, why would the best \nfinancial institutions in America oppose an amendment to stop people \nfrom cheating and violating the law in issuing mortgages? I never quite \nunderstood. Maybe their logic is this: If we let this amendment in \nwhere some of the worst lenders are held to the standard, then maybe \nthe Government will take a closer look at us, too, so let's be opposed \nto all amendments. Let's try to protect everybody in the industry even \nif what they are doing is fundamentally unfair and even illegal. That \nis the best argument I can come up with.\n  I urge those in the financial industry who may be following this \ndebate and desperately trying to see this bill pass, please be honest \nabout this. Do you want to protect the subprime lenders, these \npredatory lenders who are engaged in the worst practices in your \nbusiness? Why in the world would you want them to stay in business? Why \nwould you want to protect them in court when they give lending a bad \nname, which is your business?\n  There are an awful lot of examples I can give. Let me mention a few \ncases before I close. Alonzo Hardaway owned a home in Pennsylvania for \n28 years, raised his family there, went through a divorce there, his \nparents died there, but he no longer lives there. As of summer, he was \nliving in a homeless shelter. Why? Because in 1999 a home remodeler and \nsubprime lender convinced Mr. Hardaway to take a home equity loan for \n$35,000 at 13-percent interest to redo his kitchen windows and doors. \nWhen this 56-year-old man's trash hauling business faltered, he \ndefaulted on his loan, his home was sold at a sheriff's sale and he was \nevicted in March of 2004. The loan is with The Associates, a large \nsubprime lender later bought by Citigroup, which 2 years ago paid $215 \nmillion in fines for unscrupulous lending. That was documented in the \nPittsburgh Post-Gazette.\n  There are many other examples. I mention one or two of particular \ninterest. Here is one of a victim of appraisal fraud known as ``house \nflipping.'' Ms. Wragg, a retired school aide, found the home of her \ndreams in a little neighborhood in Brooklyn. It was a classic brick \nhouse with a porch, a backyard. She had not originally set out to be an \nowner, but her eyes drifted to an advertisement offering the home of \nher dreams. She began her journey.\n  Now, 2 years later, she said that journey has turned into a \nnightmare. Her life savings has been depleted by a house she could \nnever afford. The house was appraised at far more than it was worth and \nMs. Wragg was given two mortgages she would never have qualified for, \ncarrying costs more than double her income. She blames the mortgage \ncompany, the appraiser, the lawyer who represented her, and United \nHomes, LLC, of Briarwood, Queens, the company that owned the home, \nplaced the ad, and arranged almost everything about closing. This is \nwhat she said: I trusted them, because I had never done this before and \nI didn't know any better.\n  These cases go on and on. I will not read them into the Record. There \nis one in your community, in your State. Maybe it happened in your \nfamily. You have read about them. You have seen them on television. And \nI am sure you wondered, Who is going to stop this abuse and \nexploitation? We only stop it when we tell these companies we will not \nprotect you in bankruptcy court. You cannot take away the home of \nsomeone if you have engaged in illegal practices in issuing your \nmortgage.\n  When we consider the amendments before the Senate on this bankruptcy \nbill, I hope we will not only hold those walking in the bankruptcy \ncourt seeking relief from their debts to high standards of moral \nconduct, we will also hold the creditors who are seeking repayment of \ndebts to the same conduct, perhaps just legal conduct, which is the \nonly standard I have included in my amendment.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coburn). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S1923]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 4:55 today, \nthe Senate proceed to vote in relation to the following amendments: \nKennedy No. 28, Kennedy No. 29, and Corzine No. 32; provided further \nthat prior to the first vote there be 10 minutes equally divided for \ndebate, and that there be 2 minutes equally divided for debate prior to \nthe second and third vote. I further ask consent that no second-degree \namendments be in order to the above amendments prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                       Amendments Nos. 28 and 29\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 4 minutes.\n  Mr. President, in America, we believe that if you work hard, meet \nyour family responsibilities, then you should be able to provide for \nyour family. You should be able to afford a decent home for your family \nin a safe neighborhood. You should be able to send your children to \ncollege so they can enjoy lives of opportunity and happiness. You \nshould be able to save for a comfortable retirement after years of \ndisciplined saving and careful planning. That is the American dream. It \nis a dream of opportunity, of fairness, of infinite hope for the \nfuture.\n  But in recent times, average Americans have had to work harder and \nharder to fulfill their hopes and dreams. In just the past 4 years, \nhousing prices are up 33 percent, college tuition is up 35 percent, and \nhealth care costs are up 59 percent. Families are counting their \npennies. And now this Republican Congress wants to make it even harder \nwith this bankruptcy bill.\n  Corporate CEOs can force their companies into bankruptcy and enrich \nthemselves, but they are not held accountable. This bill ignores their \nirresponsible actions. But an average American facing cancer can lose \neverything under this bill: their home, their savings, their hopes, \ntheir dreams. They get no second chance.\n  One day, you are doing well. You have done all the right things. Your \nfamily is healthy and happy. And the next day, you discover that you \nhave cancer, and even though you have health insurance, you are left \nwith $35,000 in medical bills. You cash in your savings. You sell your \nsecond car. You sell your mother's wedding ring. You take out a second \nmortgage on your home. But it still is not enough. Half the Americans \nin bankruptcy face this exact situation. Their illness was bad enough, \nbut now their medical bills are destroying their lives, and this bill \nadds further injury to their pain.\n  CEOs can get away with it. They are not held responsible for their \ncompanies' bankruptcies. Look at Enron, WorldCom, and Polaroid. But \nthis bill requires average citizens to pay and pay and pay and pay, \neven when you do not have a dime to your name. And who is first in line \nto get your money? The credit card companies. They do not care if you \nare sick. They demand your money--with interest.\n  My amendments would give those facing illness a real second chance. \nOne amendment says, if you are sick, you do not have to lose your home. \nIt says that if illness forces you into bankruptcy, at least $150,000 \nof equity that you have built up in your home is yours--no matter what. \nFat cats who go into bankruptcy do not lose their mansions. They can \nbuild palaces in Florida and Texas, and the bankruptcy courts cannot \ntouch them. So my amendment says, if you get sick, you should at least \nget some protection for your home, too.\n  My other amendment says that if your medical bills force you into \nbankruptcy and they exceed 25 percent of your income, you are not \nsubject to this bill's harsh provisions. You are not penalized under \nits so-called means test, which would require you to keep paying down \non your bills even when you cannot afford it.\n  Let's give our fellow Americans a chance. They will do their part to \nrebuild their lives. We should help them, not hurt them.\n  I urge my colleagues to support these amendments.\n  I withhold the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1 minute 11 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time is there for the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes 30 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time of \nthe quorum call be charged to the other side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 32\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, how much time is left on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 2 minutes 38 seconds.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would like to comment on Senator Corzine's amendment \nNo. 32 to exempt ``economically distressed caregivers'' from the means \ntest. I remind all of my colleagues that people who are economically \ndistressed and have incomes below the median income already will be \nexempt from the means test. Secondly, I point out that page 10 of the \nbill is explicit that expenses people incur for the care and support of \nan elderly, chronically ill or disabled member of their household or \nfamily is subtracted from their income, even if they have very high \nincome. This means that the bankruptcy bill we have drafted will still \nallow people who take care of their sick and aging family members to \nfile for bankruptcy under chapter 7, the chapter that allows you to \ncompletely wipe out all your debts.\n  Let me read directly from page 10 of the statute. In other words, the \namendment is covered by the legislation. It came up in committee. We \ntalked about it, and it was adopted. When we talk about monthly \nexpenses, you are trying to determine if your income level exceeds \nmedian income level and whether you can afford to pay anything back if \nyou owe some of your debts and you have a higher income. So it reads:\n\n       In addition, the debtor's monthly expenses may include, if \n     applicable, the continuation of actual expenses paid by the \n     debtor that are reasonable and necessary for the care and \n     support of an elderly, chronically ill, or disabled household \n     member or member of debtor's immediate family (including \n     parents, grandparents, siblings, children, and grandchildren \n     of debtor, the dependents of the debtor, and the spouse of \n     the debtor in a joint case who is not a dependent) and who is \n     unable to pay such reasonable and necessary expenses.\n\n  So we have dealt with that. We tried to consider these things and be \nreasonable as we calculated this. There was a concern expressed in \ncommittee that people might not be able to pay back any of the money \nbecause they have debts as a caregiver. That is taken care of already \nin the statute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield my remaining time to the Senator \nfrom New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. May I inquire how much time is available?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 58 seconds available.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Let me start by saying, I don't understand why we are \ntrying to solve a problem on large swathes of our society in the case \nof the economically distressed caregivers--there were 44.125 million in \nbankruptcy last year--why we think 5 percent of the population or 10 \npercent of the population, of those that are using the bankruptcy laws \nneed to have a whole adjustment in how we approach putting people into \nbankruptcy to take\n\n[[Page S1924]]\n\ncare of a small percentage of individuals, when in fact including the \nconsideration of deductions of expenses that would go under chapter 13, \nwhy we don't want to encourage families to take care of their \nindividuals. I hope my colleagues will support the Corzine amendment \nwhich takes care of economically distressed caregivers.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 28\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n28.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The following Senator was necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Santorum).\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, for the information of our colleagues, we \ndo have two more votes. I cannot yet announce about votes later \ntonight, but we will do it shortly after the second vote. We would like \nto continue business, but as soon as we finish that second vote we will \nbe making an announcement as to the future plans tonight. There are two \nstacked votes.\n  Tomorrow morning, in all likelihood, we will have debate, and then \nlate in the morning we will have some stacked votes as well. Again, I \nwill say more about that tonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, in this bankruptcy bill, in several \nStates there are the protections for homesteads of multimillion dollar \nhomes. All this amendment says is that if one has severe medical \nproblems that are going to drive one into bankruptcy, they will be able \nto have a protection for up to $150,000 in home equity. We know that \napproximately 50 percent of the total bankruptcies are medically \nrelated, and what we are saying is that in those cases where we have \nthe high costs of health care, because of cancer or the sickness of a \nchild, we will carve out a homestead for $150,000 and protect that \nhomestead. That is what this amendment does. We have the protections \nfor much larger homesteads in a number of States. Let us protect our \nfamilies.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, there is a great deal of misinformation \nout about the impact of health care expenses on bankruptcy. Let me just \nsay what the Department of Justice, U.S. Trustee Program, has found by \nexamining 5,000 petitions, where you state exactly what the debts are, \nthat 54 percent of the bankruptcies do not mention health care at all. \nThey say, of the ones that mention health care, only 10 percent show it \nover $5,000. And of the total debts shown on those forms, only 5 \npercent represent health care debts. That is No. 1.\n  No. 2, this bill absolutely protects people and allows them to \nbankrupt and wipe out their medical debts. If you are below median \nincome, all of it is wiped out. If you are above median income, you may \nhave to pay back some of it. But I say, why should you not pay your \nhospital if you can? I ask that we vote no.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

There will now be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided on the Corzine amendment numbered 32.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, this is an amendment that is \nunjustified, incredibly unjustified. It basically says if you take off \none month from work to\n\n[[Page S1925]]\n\ntake care of a family member in need, you can never be put in chapter \n13 and pay back some of your debts, even if your income is $500,000 a \nyear.\n  I think Senator Leahy offered the amendment in committee. On page 10 \nit says:\n\n       (II) In addition, the debtor's monthly expenses may \n     include, if applicable, the continuation of actual expenses \n     paid by the debtor that are reasonable and necessary for care \n     and support of an elderly, chronically ill, or disabled \n     household member or member of the debtor's immediate family \n     (including parents, grandparents, siblings, children and \n     grandchildren of the debtor, the dependents of the debtor, \n     the spouse . . .\n\n  And so forth. It is provided for in the bill. This amendment will \ngive an absolute exemption no matter what the person's income is. It \nabsolutely should be voted down.\n  Mr. CORZINE. This amendment deals with the economically distressed \ncaregivers. There are 44 million of those in America. Mr. President, \n$257 billion is saved each year by family caregiving. If we value \nfamilies, we ought to protect them under the harsh changes we are \nimplementing here. I hope people will say we want to reward that. There \nare 125,000 bankruptcies a year from distressed caregiving. This is one \nwhere family values and all of the things that people claim they care \nabout are represented. This ought to be carved out from the bankruptcy \nreform. I hope my colleagues will support this.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, for the information of our colleagues, this \nwill be the last rollcall vote tonight. We will continue debate tonight \non amendments. We will plan on stacking votes on those amendments--not \nfirst thing in the morning but late morning or very early afternoon.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I hope people on our side, if they have \namendments to offer, will offer the amendments tonight. If they are \nbankruptcy-related amendments, we would like to have them tonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. \nThe yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, over the last years, as the economy \ncame down from the highs of the 1990s, we have seen devastating \ncorporate bankruptcies and how they can affect workers and their \nfamilies. I have seen that in my State, and we have all seen that in \nour States. From the enormous Enron bankruptcy at the end of 2001 to \nthe bankruptcies in my State, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, of Wheeling-Pitt, \nWeirton Steel, Horizon Natural Resources, and involving also Kentucky, \nevery bankruptcy has brought heartache for workers who had dedicated \nthemselves to employers, many of them for many years.\n  In many cases, employees and retirees have very limited ability under \nbankruptcy to recover their wages, to recover their severance or any \nbenefits they are due when companies seek protection from their \ncreditors. Workers deserve better. And as we debate changes to our \nNation's bankruptcy laws, Congress must address, in this Senator's \njudgment, these injustices.\n  Today I am offering an amendment to strengthen the rights of workers \nand retirees in bankruptcy. I am very\n\n[[Page S1926]]\n\npleased that Senator Leahy, the distinguished ranking Democrat on the \nSenate Judiciary Committee, is an original cosponsor of this amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent to add Senators Dayton and Obama as \ncosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Specifically, the amendment will do two things. \nFirst, it would allow employees to recover more of the back pay or \nother compensation that is owed to them at the time of the bankruptcy.\n  Second, it will ensure that retirees whose promised health insurance \nis taken away receive at least some compensation for their lost \nbenefits.\n  In the simplest terms, employees sell their labor to companies. They \ntoil away in offices and plants and factories and mills and mines \nbecause they are promised that at the end of the day they will receive \na certain compensation. Many workers then have a difficult time \nrecovering what is owed to them by their employer when their company, \nas so often happens these days, files for bankruptcy.\n  Under current law, employees are entitled to a priority claim of up \nto $4,925. That is it. The legislation we are debating would increase \nthat claim to $10,000, which is better. But even that figure is usually \nnot enough to cover the back wages, vacation time, severance pay, or \npayment benefits the employees are owed for work done prior to the \nbankruptcy. Congress needs to update the amount of the priority claim \nto ensure that more workers are able to receive what is rightfully \ntheirs. My amendment, thereby, would increase the priority claim to \n$15,000. So we are basically going from $5,000 to $15,000.\n  My amendment would also eliminate the accrual time period for \ncalculation of priority claims. In too many cases, employees are not \nable to receive the full amount of the priority claim because the \nbankruptcy courts have interpreted the accrual period very strictly. \nJudges do not agree that promised severance pay for accrued vacation \ntime was all earned in the last 90 or 100 days before bankruptcy, even \nwhen it might have been. Because there is no uniformity in the way \nthese benefits are earned or paid, the location of the bankruptcy \nchanges the way the wage priority operates and results in costly and \ntime-consuming legislation, litigation over the accrual of benefits. \nEliminating the accrual time period streamlines the application of the \nwage priority and allows employees to recover more of what they have \nearned.\n  Another important type of compensation that workers earn is the right \nto enjoy certain benefits when they retire. Pensions, life insurance, \nor health care coverage are earned by workers--it is part of the deal--\nin addition to their weekly paychecks. They have reason to expect these \nthings will be coming to them. We know the nature of the American \neconomy is changing. I do not argue that. Yet sadly we have seen many \ncompanies in the past few years abandon the promises they made when \nthey declared bankruptcy.\n  Sometimes bankruptcy is used as a reason to avoid promises that were \nmade. More and more we see companies taking the easy road by abandoning \ncommitments they made to workers. For retirees who have planned for \ntheir golden years based upon the benefits they have earned, losing \nhealth insurance could be a devastating blow. That is sort of one of \nthe more obvious statements one can make. Retirees must have the right \nto reasonable compensation if the company seeks to break its promise to \nprovide health insurance.\n  Under current law, these retirees receive what is called a general \nunsecured claim for the value of the benefits they lost. As any \ncreditor will tell you, a general unsecured claim is essentially \nworthless in most bankruptcies. It means you are at the end of the line \nand there are not enough assets to go around. This law allows companies \nto essentially rescind compensation that retirees have earned with \nvirtually no cost to the company. Of course, that is a great deal for \nthe company, but it is spectacularly unfair to the retirees.\n  Recognizing that so-called legacy costs are often an impossible \nburden for a company that is trying to emerge from bankruptcy, my \namendment would still allow companies in some circumstances to alter \nthe health coverage offered to retirees. However, it would require that \nthe company pay at least some minimum level of compensation to \nretirees.\n  Under my proposal, each retiree would be entitled to a payment equal \nto the cost of purchasing comparable health insurance for a period of \n18 months. I will repeat that. Each retiree would be entitled to a \npayment equal to the cost of purchasing comparable health insurance for \na period of 18 months. Of course, 18 months of health insurance \ncoverage is a lot less than many of these retirees are losing, but it \ncan ease the transition as retirees try to make alternative plans, and \nit will discourage companies from thinking that terminating retiree \nhealth coverage is an easy solution or perhaps even part of the reason \nfor seeking bankruptcy in the first place. The retirees would still be \nentitled to a general unsecured claim for the value of the benefits \nlost in excess of this one-time payment. This change would ensure that \nretirees, while still not being made whole on lost benefits, will at \nleast receive some compensation for broken promises.\n  Mr. President, I understand that many creditors or investors are not \nable to recover what is rightfully owed to them in the course of \nbankruptcy, but employees deserve protection that recognizes the unique \nnature of their dependence on the employer. Any smart investor \ndiversifies his or her portfolio so that a bankruptcy at one company \ndoes not bankrupt the investor. Likewise, suppliers and creditors that \ndo business with a company typically have many other clients. That is \nnot the case, however, with workers. They cannot diversify away the \nrisk of working for a bankrupt company. They are there all by \nthemselves, and the financial hardship bankruptcy brings is more \ndevastating to the average worker than the average creditor or \nsupplier. I believe that logic is pretty clear.\n  The relief provided by this amendment is modest. It will not take the \nsting out of bankruptcy. By definition, a bankruptcy is a failure, and \nit is painful for the company's employees, retirees, and also for the \nbusiness partners. But by this amendment we would make progress toward \nensuring that bankruptcies are more fair--more fair to workers who gave \ntheir time, energy, and sweat to the company in exchange for certain \npromised compensation, which then did not turn out to be available.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise to discuss my opposition to the \nDurbin amendment to S. 256, the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and \nConsumer Protection Act of 2005.\n  I have tremendous respect for my colleague from Illinois, and believe \nhe has only the best of intentions with this amendment, which would \nexempt members of the armed forces from the means testing required \nunder the bill before us.\n  I have the most profound respect for our servicemen and women, and \nfor our Nation's veterans. Many of you know that my oldest son Brooks \nis a member of the Armed Forces, and saw active duty in Iraq with the \n101st Airborne. But with all due respect, I believe this amendment \ncould in fact harm America's soldiers.\n  Two years ago, we spent a great deal of time reauthorizing the Fair \nCredit Reporting Act, the statute governing our Nation's credit \ngranting system. This system is the finest in the world and has \nessentially opened up access to credit to working Americans throughout \nthis country, regardless of race, gender, marital status, physical \nlocation, medical condition, or profession. If someone has the ability \nto pay, then the credit system allows underwriters to grant credit to \nthat individual without bias.\n  S. 256 is carefully crafted so we don't reintroduce possible bias \ninto this system. It would be unacceptable to undo the system which has \nopened doors of opportunity to millions of Americans who in the past \nwho had experienced bias in the lending process.\n  Under Senator Durbin's amendment, military personnel filing for \nbankruptcy would be exempt from the means test and would automatically\n\n[[Page S1927]]\n\nqualify for a Chapter 7 filing, regardless of whether that person has \nthe ability to repay part of his or her debt.\n  If this amendment were to pass, potential creditors would have a \nlegitimate concern that loans to military personnel could require \ndifferent underwriting standards. This could well mean higher interest \nrates for our soldiers and veterans. Even more disturbing, this would \nintroduce bias into the system against soldiers and veterans--a \nperverse result and clearly not what this amendment envisions.\n  The Senator from Illinois raises a concern that none of us should \nturn our backs on: and that is whether our servicemen and women are \nfairly compensated, and whether they have the resources they need, \nparticularly during deployment, to take care of their families. I call \non the Congress to look carefully at this issue, and to make sure we \nare doing right by our military personnel and veterans.\n  But I urge you not to remedy any possible injustices through the \nbankruptcy courts.\n  Bankruptcy represents a longstanding commitment in this country to \nhelping people get a fresh start. This principle has never been giving \nonly certain people a fresh start: for example, only if you are a \nteacher, or a doctor or a soldier. If we started down that road, I'm \nnot sure what would happen to most members of Congress, who tend to be \nlawyers.\n  The point is, this safety net should be available when a person truly \ncannot make good on his or her commitments, no matter who he or she is \nor what she does for a living.\n  No matter how noble the individual, no matter how compelling the \nstory behind the economic need, the bankruptcy system must treat people \nequally and fairly.\n  This bill establishes a simple means test, which will affect \napproximately 10 percent of current filers. All it says is, after we've \nbacked out all your current expenses, including your your house \npayment, your car payment, your child care costs, your education costs, \nyour utility costs, your medical costs, and a whole host of other \nitems, if after backing out all these payments you have the ability to \npay back some of your loans, then you should. That's only right. That's \nonly fair. And it shouldn't matter what your profession is.\n  Americans are an honorable people, and we work hard and play by the \nrules. If you can pay your debts, you should.\n  I am also troubled about the message this amendment sends about \nchapter 13 filings.\n  The implication is, do anything you can to avoid a repayment plan. \nThe fact is, under the mechanism set forth in this bill, we have an \nunprecedented opportunity to help debtors rehabilitate their credit \nrating faster under a chapter 13 proceeding.\n  I will be working to encourage bankruptcy trustees to report on-time \npayments under a chapter 13 payment plan to the three major credit \nbureaus, so that debtors who get back on track will, quite literally, \nget credit for that discipline.\n  I also pledge to work with the creditor community to help them \nunderstand how these new payment reports might help them evaluate a \nchapter 13 debtor.\n  An amendment that automatically steers debtors to chapter 7 is \nmisguided and would give no thought to the potential benefits of a \nchapter 13 filing.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/02/senate-section/article/S1927-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1927]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DeMINT.

He was 21 years old.\n  SPC Gooding grew up in Keokuk, IA and eventually moved to the Des \nMoines area. He attended the Scavo Alternative School and Lincoln High \nSchool. In the fall of 2000, at the age of 17, Dakotah fulfilled a \nlife-long dream of joining the U.S. Army, following in the footsteps of \nmany family members. He had served in the United States and Korea \nbefore going to Iraq. SPC Gooding came to Iraq as part of an Army \nSpecial Security Force that helped with voter protection in the recent \nhistoric democratic elections.\n  A cousin mentioned that SPC Gooding knew he had a mission to protect \nthose around the world and those at home. SPC Gooding's mission was a \nnoble one, and he carried it out with the courage and dignity that are \nso characteristic of our American soldiers. For his dedication and \nsacrifice, Dakotah deserves our respect and admiration. For family and \nfriends who have felt this loss most deeply, I offer my sincere \nsympathy. My prayers go out to his wife, Angela, his mother, Judith, \nhis two sisters, and his many other family and friends.\n  May we always remember with pride and appreciation Specialist Dakotah \nL.

The \nassailants than assaulted the two men and fled the scene. The incident \nis being investigated as a hate crime.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/02/senate-section/article/S1928-2", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1928]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Feinstein as a \ncosponsor of her legislation to reauthorize the assault weapons ban. I \nvoted for the original 1994 assault weapons ban and for the amendment \nto reauthorize the ban in the 108th Congress.\n  When the 1994 assault weapons ban expired on September 13, 2004, \ncriminals and terrorists gained potential easy access to 19 of the \nhighest powered and most lethal firearms produced. In addition to \nbanning 19 specific weapons, the assault weapons ban also prohibited \nthe sale of semiautomatic weapons that incorporated a detachable \nmagazine and two or more specific military features. These features \nincluded folding/telescoping stocks, protruding pistol grips, bayonet \nmounts, threaded muzzles or flash suppressors, barrel shrouds, or \ngrenade launchers. Common sense tells us that there is no reason for \ncivilians to have easy access to guns with these military style \nfeatures.\n  During the 108th Congress, I joined with the majority of my Senate \ncolleagues in adopting an amendment to reauthorize the assault weapons \nban for another 10 years. However, the bill to which it was attached \nwas later derailed. Despite the overwhelming support of the law \nenforcement community, the ongoing threat of terrorism, bipartisan \nsupport in the Senate, and the pleas of Americans who have already lost \nloved ones to assault weapons tragedies, the ban was allowed to expire, \nas the President and the Republican Congressional leadership were \nunwilling to act.\n  Despite the National Rifle Association's assertions that the ban is \nineffective, unnecessary, and that guns labeled as assault weapons are \nrarely used in violent crimes, the need for the assault weapons ban is \nclear. Just last week, AK-47 assault rifles, like the ones included in \nthe original assault weapons ban, were reportedly used in two separate \nshootings in Texas and California that left four people dead and four \nothers seriously injured, three of whom were police officers. In Tyler, \nTX, a gunman armed with an AK-47, wearing a military flak jacket and a \nbulletproof vest, opened fire outside a courthouse, killing his ex-wife \nand wounding his son. In the ensuing shootout with police, the gunman \nwas reportedly able to fire as many as 50 rounds at police and innocent \nbystanders before fleeing in his truck. He was finally shot in another \ngun battle with police a few miles away. The same day in Los Angeles, a \nman reportedly armed with an AK-47 walked into his workplace and shot \ntwo of his coworkers to death following a dispute. He later turned \nhimself in at a Los Angeles police station.\n  Unfortunately, assault weapons such as the ones reportedly used in \nthese two shootings as well as many other similar assault weapons are \nonce again being legally produced and sold as a result of the \nexpiration of the assault weapons ban. I again urge my colleagues to \nact to help prevent tragedies like these by enacting a common sense ban \non assault weapons.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/02/senate-section/article/S1928-3", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1928]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        SENATOR HIRAM R. REVELS\n\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise to recognize an important \nanniversary in the history of this Nation.\n  One hundred and thirty-five years ago on this day, Hiram R. Revels \nwas sworn in as a U.S. Senator from Mississippi. On that day, February \n25, 1870, Senator Revels became the first African American to ever \nserve in the U.S. Congress.\n  But Hiram Revel's story started in a place very far from Washington, \nDC. He was born to free parents in 1822 and grew up as an apprentice to \na barber in North Carolina. But Hiram wanted to learn more and see \nmore, and so he left for Indiana and then Ohio, where he furthered his \neducation. He was soon ordained a minister by the African Methodist \nChurch, and traveled to congregations all over the Midwest and the \nSouth until he finally ended up in Baltimore.\n  At the beginning of the Civil War, he helped recruit African-American \ntroops for the Union, and he ended up serving as a chaplain for a \nMississippi regiment of free Blacks. He stayed in Mississippi after the \nwar, and continued serving as a pastor at various local churches. In \n1868, and he ran and was elected alderman. Respected by both Whites and \nAfrican Americans, he was soon elected as a Mississippi State senator. \nThen, in 1870, just 5 years after the end of the very war fought for \nhis freedom, Hiram Revels was elected the first African-American U.S. \nSenator in history.\n  Like so many of our own, Hiram's story is America's story. The story \nof the seemingly impossible occurring in a land where good people will \ngive everything to make it possible. The story of hope winning out \nagainst all odds. The story of one man's improbable achievement paving \nthe way for so many others.\n  Did Hiram ever know what he was destined for in that barber shop? \nWhen he was sweeping that floor in North Carolina and so many of his \nbrothers and sisters were enslaved, did he ever dream that he would end \nup a U.S. Senator?\n  We don't know. But we do know that he did dream of bigger things.\n  He dreamed of an education, and so even though many kids like him \ndidn't do it, he went to college. He dreamed of helping others, and so \neven though it involved sacrifice, he became a minister. He dreamed of \na free America, and so even though it could have cost him his life, he \njoined the Union. And he dreamed of lifting up his community, and so \neven though it wasn't done by people of his color, he ran for office.\n  He dreamed of making this world a better place, and in doing so, he \nfound a place in history. And so we remember this day--his day--as a \nsymbol of what is possible for those of us who are willing to make it \nso in this magical place we call America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/02/senate-section/article/S1928-4", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1928-S1929]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise to recognize and remember the \nlife of Earl Langdon Neal.\n  Mr. Neal was one of the finest lawyers and civic leaders Chicago has \never known. From mayors to citizens, business leaders to college \nstudents, he was a trusted friend and inspiring mentor to many--\nincluding myself.\n\n[[Page S1929]]\n\n  Earl earned his law degree from Michigan Law School in 1952. \nFollowing graduation, he served his country in the U.S. Army until \n1955, when he returned to Chicago to join his father's law firm, Neal & \nNeal.\n  On their very first case, Earl and his father were forced to commute \n170 miles from Chicago to Lincoln simply because there were no hotels \nin Lincoln that would accept African Americans. But he went anyway \nbecause, as his son has said, it wasn't just a job for Earl--it was a \nway of life.\n  It was a way of life that led him to serve the city of Chicago as a \nspecial assistant corporation counsel responsible for countless land \nacquisition projects, including the Dan Ryan Expressway, O'Hare's \nexpansion, and the Chicago city colleges, a way of life that led him to \nstart his own practice and earn a place on the University of Illinois \nboard of trustees, a way of life that made almost every person who came \nto know him speak of him as a warm, compassionate man who put the well-\nbeing of his clients above all else.\n  Earl's passion for his work wasn't complicated. He simply looked \naround his community and wanted to make it better. And in so many ways, \nfrom the places he made possible, to the people's lives he touched, he \ndid. We honor his life, pray for his family, and will miss him \ndearly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/02/senate-section/article/S1929-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1929]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/02/senate-section/article/S1929-2", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1929]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting nominations \nwhich were referred to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/02/senate-section/article/S1929-3", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1929]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:23 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \nagreed to the following concurrent resolution, without amendment:\n\n       S.

A bill to amend the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets \nAct of 1968 to expand the definition of firefighter to include \napprentices and trainees, regardless of age or duty limitations; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition today to introduce the \nChristopher Kangas Fallen Firefighter Apprentice Act, a bill designed \nto correct a flaw in the current definition of ``firefighter'' under \nthe Public Safety Officer Benefits Act.\n  On May 4, 2002, 14-year-old Christopher Kangas was struck by a car \nand killed while he was riding his bicycle in Brookhaven, PA. The local \nauthorities later confirmed that Christopher was out on his bike that \nday for an important reason: Chris Kangas was a junior firefighter, and \nhe was responding to a fire emergency.\n  Under Pennsylvania law, 14- and 15-year-olds such as Christopher are \npermitted to serve as volunteer junior firefighters. While they are not \nallowed to operate heavy machinery or enter burning buildings, the law \npermits them to fill a number of important support roles, such as \nproviding first aid. In addition, the junior firefighter program is an \nimportant recruitment tool for fire stations throughout the \nCommonwealth. In fact, prior to his death Christopher had received 58 \nhours of training that would have served him well when he graduated \nfrom the junior program.\n  It is clear to me that Christopher Kangas was a firefighter killed in \nthe line of duty. Were it not for his status as a junior firefighter \nand his prompt response to a fire alarm, Christopher would still be \nalive today. Indeed, the Brookhaven Fire Department, Brookhaven \nBorough, and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania have all recognized \nChristopher as a fallen public safety officer and provided the \nappropriate death benefits to his family.\n  Yet, while those closest to the tragedy have recognized Christopher \nas a fallen firefighter, the Federal Government has not. The U.S. \nDepartment of Justice (DOJ) determined that Christopher Kangas was not \neligible for benefits because he was not acting within a narrow range \nof duties at the time of his death that are the measured criteria to be \nconsidered a ``firefighter,'' and therefore, was not a ``public safety \nofficer'' for purposes of the Public Safety Officer Benefits Act. In \norder to be eligible for benefits under the Public Safety Officer \nBenefits Act, an officer's death must be considered the ``direct and \nproximate result of a personal injury sustained in the line of duty.'' \nAlthough the United States Code includes firefighters in the definition \nof ``public safety officer'' and specifies a firefighter as ``an \nindividual serving as an officially-recognized or designated member of \na legally-organized volunteer fire department;'' it offers no \ndefinition of ``line of duty''. DOJ had to defer to an arbitrarily \nnarrow definition of ``line of duty,'' as described in the Code of \nFederal Regulations that restricts activities to the ``suppression of \nfires.'' DOJ decided that the only people who qualify as firefighters \nare those who play the starring role of operating a hose on a ladder or \nentering a burning building. According to this interpretation, those, \nsuch as junior firefighters, who play the essential supporting roles of \ndirecting traffic, performing first aid, or dispatching fire vehicles \ndo not contribute to the act of suppressing the fire.\n  Any firefighter will tell you that there are many important roles to \nplay in fighting a fire beyond operating the hoses and ladders. \nFirefighting is a team effort, and everyone in the Brookhaven Fire \nDepartment viewed young Christopher as a full member of their team.\n  As a result of this DOJ determination, Christopher's family will not \nreceive a $267,000 Federal line-of-duty benefit. In addition, \nChristopher will be barred from taking his rightful place on the \nNational Fallen Firefighters Memorial in Emmitsburg, MD. For a young \nman who dreamed of being a firefighter and gave his life rushing to a \nfire, keeping him off of the memorial is a grave injustice.\n  The bill I introduce today will ensure that the Federal Government \nwill recognize Christopher Kangas and others like him as firefighters. \nThe bill clarifies that all firefighters will he recognized as such \n``regardless of age, status as an apprentice or trainee, or duty \nrestrictions imposed because of age or status as an apprentice or \ntrainee.'' The bill applies retroactively back to May 4, 2002 so that \nChristopher, as well as three others, can benefit from it.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FRIST (for himself, Mr. Reid, and Mr. Lugar):\n  S. 492. A bill to make access to safe water and sanitation for \ndeveloping countries a specific policy objective of the United States \nforeign assistance programs, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 492\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Safe Water: Currency for \n     Peace Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Water-related diseases are a human tragedy, killing and \n     debilitating millions of people annually, preventing millions \n     of people from leading healthy lives, and undermining \n     development efforts.\n       (2) Providing safe supplies of water, and sanitation and \n     hygiene improvements would save millions of lives by reducing \n     the prevalence of water-borne diseases, water-based diseases, \n     water-privation diseases, and water-related vector diseases.\n\n[[Page S1933]]\n\n       (3) An estimated 1,800,000 people die of diarrhoeal \n     diseases every year. Ninety percent of these people are \n     children under the age of five who live in developing \n     countries. Simple household and personal hygiene measures, \n     such as household water treatment and safe storage and \n     effective hand washing with soap, reduce the burden of \n     diarrhoeal disease by more than 40 percent.\n       (4) According to the World Health Organization, 88 percent \n     of diarrhoeal disease can be attributed to unsafe water \n     supply, and inadequate sanitation and hygiene.\n       (5) Around the world, more than 150,000,000 people are \n     threatened by blindness caused by trachoma, a disease that is \n     spread through poor hygiene and sanitation, and aggravated by \n     inadequate water supply.\n       (6) Chronic intestinal helminth infections are a leading \n     source of global morbidity, including cognitive impairment \n     and anemia for hundred of millions of children and adults. \n     Access to safe water and sanitation and better hygiene \n     practices can greatly reduce the number of these infections.\n       (7) Schistosomiasis is a disease that affects 200,000,000 \n     people, 20,000,000 of whom suffer serious consequences, \n     including liver and intestinal damage. Improved water \n     resource management to reduce infestation of surface water, \n     improved sanitation and hygiene, and deworming treatment can \n     dramatically reduce this burden.\n       (8) In 2002, 2,600,000,000 people lacked access to improved \n     sanitation. In sub-Saharan Africa, only 36 percent of the \n     population has access to improved sanitation. In developing \n     countries, only 31 percent of the population in rural areas \n     has access to improved sanitation.\n       (9) Improved management of water resources can contribute \n     to comprehensive strategies for controlling mosquito \n     populations associated with life-threatening vector-borne \n     diseases in developing countries, especially malaria, which \n     kills more than 1,000,000 people each year, most of whom are \n     children.\n       (10) Natural disasters such as floods and droughts threaten \n     people's health. Floods contaminate drinking-water systems \n     with industrial waste refuse, sewage, and human and animal \n     excreta. Droughts exacerbate malnutrition and limit access to \n     drinking water supplies. Sound water resource management can \n     mitigate the impact of such natural disasters.\n       (11) The United Nations Population Fund report entitled \n     ``Water: A Critical Resource'' stated that ``Nearly 500 \n     million people [suffer from] water stress or serious water \n     scarcity. Under current trends, two-thirds of the world's \n     population may be subject to moderate to high water stress by \n     2025''. Effective water management and equitable allocation \n     of scarce water supplies for all uses will become \n     increasingly important for meeting both human and ecosystem \n     water needs in the future.\n       (12) The participants in the World Summit on Sustainable \n     Development, held in Johannesburg, South Africa, in 2002, \n     agreed to the Plan of Implementation of the World Summit on \n     Sustainable Development which included an agreement to work \n     to reduce by one-half ``the proportion of people who are \n     unable to reach or afford safe drinking water,'' and ``the \n     proportion of people without access to basic sanitation'' by \n     2015.\n       (13) At the World Summit on Sustainable Development, \n     building on the U.S.-Japan Partnership for Security and \n     Prosperity announced in June 2001 by President Bush and Prime \n     Minister Koizumi, the United States and Japan announced a \n     Clean Water for People Initiative to cooperate in providing \n     safe water and sanitation to the world's poor, improve \n     watershed management, and increase the productivity of water.\n       (14) At the World Summit on Sustainable Development, the \n     United States announced the Water for the Poor Initiative \n     which committed the United States to provide $970,000,000 \n     over 3 years to increase access to safe water and sanitation \n     services, improve watershed management, and increase the \n     productivity of water. During fiscal year 2004, the United \n     States provided an estimated $817,000,000 in assistance to \n     the Water for the Poor Initiative, including funds made \n     available for reconstruction activities in Iraq, of which \n     $388,000,000 was made available for safe drinking water and \n     sanitation programs.\n       (15) During fiscal year 2004, the United States provided \n     $49,000,000 in assistance for activities to provide safe \n     drinking water and sanitation in sub-Saharan Africa, an \n     amount that is equal to 6.5 percent of total United States \n     foreign assistance provided for all water activities in the \n     Water for the Poor Initiative.\n       (16) At the 2003 Summit of the Group of Eight in Evian, \n     France, the members of the Group of Eight produced a plan \n     entitled ``Water: A G8 Action Plan'' that stated that a lack \n     of water can undermine human security. The Action Plan \n     committed the members of the Group of Eight to playing a more \n     active role in international efforts to provide safe water \n     and sanitation to the world's poor by mobilizing domestic \n     resources in developing countries for water infrastructure \n     financing through the development and strengthening of local \n     capital markets and financial institutions, particularly by \n     establishing, where appropriate, at the national and local \n     levels, revolving funds that offer local currency financings, \n     which allow communities to finance capital-intensive water \n     infrastructure projects over an affordable period of time at \n     competitive rates.\n       (17) The G8 Action Plan also committed members of the Group \n     of Eight to provide risk mitigation mechanisms for such \n     revolving funds and to provide technical assistance for the \n     development of efficient local financial markets and building \n     municipal government capacity to design and implement \n     financially viable projects and provide, as appropriate, \n     targeted subsidies for the poorest communities that cannot \n     fully service market rate debt.\n       (18) The United Nations General Assembly Resolution 58/217 \n     of February 9, 2004, proclaimed ``the period from 2005 to \n     2015 the International Decade for Action, `Water for Life', \n     to commence on World Water Day, 22 March 2005'' for the \n     purpose of increasing the focus of the international \n     community on water-related issues at all levels and on the \n     implementation of water-related programs and projects.\n\n     SEC. 3. WATER FOR HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT.\n\n       (a) In General.--Part I of the Foreign Assistance Act of \n     1961 (22 U.S.C. 2151 et seq.) is amended by inserting after \n     section 104C the following new section:\n\n     ``SEC. 104D. WATER FOR HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT.\n\n       ``(a) Finding.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       ``(1) Access to safe water and sanitation and improved \n     hygiene are significant factors in controlling the spread of \n     disease in the developing world and positively affecting \n     economic development.\n       ``(2) The health of children and other vulnerable rural and \n     urban populations in developing countries, especially sub-\n     Saharan Africa and South Asia, is threatened by a lack of \n     adequate safe water, sanitation, and hygiene.\n       ``(3) Efforts to meet United States foreign assistance \n     objectives, including those related to agriculture, the human \n     immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immune deficiency \n     syndrome (AIDS), and the environment will be advanced by \n     improving access to safe water and sanitation and promoting \n     sound water management throughout the world.\n       ``(4) Developing sustainable financing mechanisms, \n     including private sector financing, is critical to the long-\n     term sustainability of improved water supply, sanitation, and \n     hygiene.\n       ``(5) The annual level of investment needed to meet the \n     water and sanitation needs of developing countries far \n     exceeds the amount of Official Development Assistance (ODA) \n     and spending by governments of developing countries, so \n     attracting greater public and private investment is \n     essential.\n       ``(6) Long-term sustainability in the provision of access \n     to safe water and sanitation and in the maintenance of water \n     and sanitation facilities requires a legal and regulatory \n     environment conducive to private sector investment and \n     private sector participation in the delivery of water and \n     sanitation services.\n       ``(7) The absence of robust domestic financial markets and \n     sources for long-term financing are a major impediment to the \n     development of water and sanitation projects in developing \n     countries.\n       ``(8) At the 2003 Summit of the Group of Eight in Evian, \n     France, the members of the Group of Eight produced a plan \n     entitled `Water: A G8 Action Plan' that contemplated the \n     promotion of domestic revolving funds to provide local \n     currency financing for capital-intensive water infrastructure \n     projects. Innovative financing mechanisms such as revolving \n     funds and pooled-financings have been effective vehicles for \n     mobilizing domestic savings for investments in water and \n     sanitation both in the United States and in some developing \n     countries. These mechanisms can serve as a catalyst for \n     greater investment in water and sanitation projects by \n     villages, small towns, and municipalities.\n       ``(9) The G8 Action Plan also committed members of the \n     Group of Eight to improving coordination and cooperation \n     between donors, and such improved coordination and \n     cooperation is essential for enlarging the beneficial impact \n     of donor initiatives.\n       ``(b) Policy.--It is a major objective of United States \n     foreign assistance--\n       ``(1) to promote good health and economic development by \n     providing assistance to expand access to safe water and \n     sanitation, promote sound water management, and improve \n     hygiene for people around the world; and\n       ``(2) to promote, to the maximum extent practicable and \n     appropriate, long-term sustainability in the provision of \n     access to safe water and sanitation by encouraging private \n     investment in water and sanitation infrastructure and \n     services.\n       ``(c) Authorization.--\n       ``(1) In general.--To carry out the policy set out in \n     subsection (b), the President is authorized to furnish \n     assistance, including health information and education, to \n     advance good health and promote economic development by \n     improving the safety of water supplies, expanding access to \n     safe water and sanitation, promoting sound water management, \n     and promoting better hygiene.\n       ``(2) Local currency.--The President may use payments made \n     in local currencies under an agreement made under title I of \n     the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954 \n     (7 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) to provide assistance under this \n     section, including assistance for activities related to \n     drilling or maintaining wells.''.\n       (b) Conforming Amendment.--Section 104(c) of the \n     Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954 (7 \n     U.S.C. 1704(c)) is\n\n[[Page S1934]]\n\n     amended by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n       ``(9) Safe water.--To provide assistance under section 104D \n     of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to advance good health \n     and promote economic development by improving the safety of \n     water supplies, including programs related to drilling or \n     maintaining wells.''.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to amend title II of the Higher Education Act of 1965 \nto increase teacher familiarity with the educational needs of gifted \nand talented students, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am reintroducing a bill I proposed in \nthe last Congress to help prepare new teachers to recognize and meet \nthe needs of gifted and talented students. According to the federally \nfunded National Research Center on the Gifted and Talented, the large \nmajority of gifted and talented students spend at least 80 percent of \ntheir time in a regular education classroom. Of course, gifted students \nare not gifted only 20 percent of the time. They are gifted all the \ntime. Unfortunately, the lack of teacher preparation means that gifted \nstudents are not being challenged during much of the time they spend in \nthe classroom. Their educational needs are not being met.\n  Unfortunately, there are many misconceptions about the needs of \ngifted children. You might say, ``Why should we worry about these \nchildren? They\n\n[[Page S1935]]\n\nare the smart ones that the teacher doesn't have to spend so much time \non.'' First of all, I'm not talking about your average straight A \nstudent who maybe learns the material easily, but much the same way as \nother students in the classroom. What makes a child gifted and talented \nis not how well the child does in school, but how he or she learns. A \nstraight A student may or may not be gifted and a gifted student may \nnot always get good grades in school. Gifted and talented children \nactually have a different way of looking at the world. They tend to \nhave distinct approaches to learning and interacting socially, and they \nfrequently learn at a different pace, and to different depths, than \nothers their age. The bottom line is that gifted and talented children \nhave unique learning needs that need to be met in order for them to \nachieve to their potential.\n  To illustrate this point, I would like to remind the Senate of an \nexample I first cited two years ago while speaking on another piece of \nlegislation related to gifted and talented students. It concerns a \nyoung elementary school student from Iowa City named Jose. Jose was not \nputting much effort into his schoolwork and was getting bad grades. He \nwas a good kid but he also had a tendency to act up in class. He got \nalong with his classmates, but didn't have many friends. Jose's teacher \nwas frustrated and couldn't figure out what to do with him. Still, \nJose's parents saw in him a real hunger for learning and had his IQ \ntested over the summer. It turns out that what the teacher saw as \nbehavior problems or a lack of work ethic were really symptoms of a \ngifted student who was not being properly challenged. Jose started \nleaving his regular classroom a couple of times a week to work with a \nteacher who was trained in meeting the needs of gifted students. As a \nresult of the added stimulation he received, Jose started to enjoy \nschool more, made friends with his gifted peers, and began to succeed \nwith his regular school work.\n  Jose was fortunate that his parents were so perceptive and were able \nto have him assessed privately. However, not all parents are in a \nposition to recognize the signs of giftedness or to advocate for their \nchild's needs. Even in schools where there are active gifted and \ntalented programs, many students go unidentified. Moreover, even with \npull-out programs like the one I described that supplement the \nclassroom experience and other strategies like grade skipping, it is \ninevitable that many gifted students will spend much of their time in a \nregular classroom with non-gifted students of the same age but far \ndifferent ability levels. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it \nmeans that all classroom teachers should have at least a basic \nknowledge about how to recognize and meet the needs of gifted and \ntalented students in their classrooms. However, a national survey of \nthird and fourth grade teachers by the National Research Center on the \nGifted and Talented found that 61 percent of teachers had no training \nwhatsoever in teaching highly able students.\n  Only one State currently requires regular classroom teachers to have \ncoursework in gifted education. Some of the techniques used in \nclassrooms to accommodate gifted kids include differentiated \ncurriculum, cluster grouping, and accelerated learning. The time to \nmake sure teachers have the necessary knowledge is when prospective \nteachers are in their pre-service teacher training programs. If \nteachers aren't exposed to information and strategies to meet the needs \nof gifted students in their pre-service training, they may never \nacquire the necessary knowledge and skills. With the Higher Education \nAct due for reauthorization, this is the perfect opportunity to \nencourage schools of education and States to take a greater look at how \nthey can improve teacher preparation programs to integrate instruction \non the unique needs of gifted learners.\n  Title II of the Higher Education Act already contains grants designed \nto enhance the quality of teacher preparation programs. My bill would \nsimply add allowable uses to these existing grants to provide an \nincentive for states and teacher training programs to incorporate the \nneeds of gifted and talented students into teacher preparation and \nlicensure requirements. I should point out that this change would not \ncost the taxpayers any additional money.\n  Under current law, Title II State grants are awarded directly to \nStates and are to be used to reform State teacher preparation \nrequirements. The law lists seven potential reforms under the allowable \nuses for grant funds. The first three allowable uses include: \nstrengthening state requirements for teacher preparation programs to \nensure teachers are highly competent in their respective academic \ncontent areas, reforming certification and licensure requirements with \nrespect to competency in content areas, and providing alternatives to \ntraditional teacher preparation programs. My legislation would add \nanother allowable use, referencing these three reforms, to encourage \nstates to incorporate a focus on the learning needs of gifted and \ntalented students into reforms of state requirements for teacher \npreparation programs, reforms of state certification and licensure \nrequirements, or new alternative teacher preparation programs. In \naddition, my bill would add a new allowable use so that States could \nuse grant funds to create or expand new-teacher mentoring programs on \nthe needs of gifted and talented students. This way, new teachers could \nlearn from veteran teachers about how to identify classroom indicators \nof giftedness and provide appropriate instruction to gifted students.\n  My bill would also add language to the Partnership Grants, which \nprovide funds to partnerships among teacher preparation institutions, \nschool of arts and sciences, and high-need school districts to \nstrengthen new teacher education. These grants come with three required \nuses, including reforming teacher preparation programs to ensure \nteachers are highly competent in academic content areas, providing pre-\nservice clinical experience, and creating opportunities for enhanced \nand ongoing professional development. One allowable use for which a \npartnership may use funds is preparing teachers to work with diverse \npopulations, including individuals with disabilities and limited \nEnglish proficient individuals. To this section, my legislation would \nadd gifted and talented students. Recognizing that every teacher could \nhave gifted students in his or her classroom, my bill would also add a \nnew allowable use so that teacher preparation programs could use the \nfunds to infuse teacher coursework with units on the characteristics of \nhigh-ability learners. In other words, the idea is not to require \nadditional courses, but rather to discuss how to accommodate for the \nneeds of gifted students throughout the teacher preparation curriculum \nwhen new teachers are learning how to present lessons.\n  Again, my bill does not create a new grant program and doesn't cost \nany more money. It simply provides an incentive through existing grant \nprograms to encourage States and teacher preparation programs to make \nsure that new teachers have the skills they will need to identify and \nmeet the unique needs of the gifted and talented students who will be \nin their classrooms. I think we all recognize how important a quality \nteacher can be in helping a student achieve. This is no less true with \ngifted and talented students. Having a teacher that is equipped to meet \nthe unique needs of gifted students can mean the difference between a \nchild hating school and a child loving school; a child falling behind, \nand a child succeeding beyond all expectations. When a gifted child is \nleft behind, the loss of human potential is doubly tragic. Gifted and \ntalented children are a national resource that we must nurture now for \nour nation's future. This modest step could reap rewards for \ngenerations to come. I urge my colleagues to join me in this investment \nin our future.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Ms. Collins, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Levin, \n        Mr. Leahy, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Coleman, Mr. \n        Durbin, Mr. Dayton, Mr. Pryor, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Lautenberg, and \n        Mr. Carper):\n  S. 494. A bill to amend chapter 23 of title 5, United States Code, to \nclarify the disclosures of information protected from prohibited \npersonnel practices, require a statement in nondisclosure policies, \nforms, and agreements that such policies, forms, and agreements conform \nwith certain disclosure\n\n[[Page S1936]]\n\nprotections, provide certain authority for the Special Counsel, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President. Today I rise to reintroduce the Federal \nEmployee Protection of Disclosures Act, which was unanimously reported \nout of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee \nlast year with strong bipartisan support. I am joined again in this \neffort by Senator Collins, chairman of the committee, whose focus on \nthis issue and willingness to work with me in developing this \nlegislation demonstrates how important it is to ensure that Federal \nemployees are protected when they disclose government waste, fraud, and \nabuse. I am pleased to be joined by our committee's ranking member, \nSenator Lieberman.\n  Once again, I am proud to have the support of Senator Charles \nGrassley and Senator Carl Levin, both of whom are longstanding \nadvocates of Federal whistleblowers. My colleagues from Iowa and \nMichigan championed the 1989 Whistleblower Protection Act and have \nsupported my legislation since 2001. Their support, along with the \nstrong bipartisan support of Senators Leahy, Voinovich, Coleman, \nDurbin, Dayton, Pryor, Johnson, Lautenberg, and Carper demonstrates the \nimportance of this good government legislation.\n  Our legislation will strengthen the protections given to Federal \nwhistleblowers and encourage employees to come forward to disclose \ngovernment waste, fraud, and abuse. Providing meaningful protection to \nwhistleblowers fosters an environment that promotes the disclosure of \ngovernment wrongdoing and mismanagement that may adversely affect the \nAmerican public. If Federal employees fear reprisal for blowing the \nwhistle, we fail to protect the whistleblower, taxpayers, and, in \nnotable instances, national security and our public health.\n  The most recent example is the disclosure by Dr. David Graham of the \nFood and Drug Administration, FDA, who exposed problems at the FDA \nregarding the safety of new pharmaceuticals. By revealing the threat \nposed to public health and the safety of pharmaceuticals currently on \nthe market, as well as the organizational structure of the Center for \nDrug Evaluation and Research, CDER, and CDER's internal conflict of \ninterest in evaluating the safety of drugs both pre- and post-\nmarketing, Dr. Graham risked his career to report hazards to our public \nhealth.\n  As a direct result of Dr. Graham's decision to speak publicly, \nAmericans are now more aware of the potential risks of various \npharmaceuticals and government leaders are seeking ways to increase \ntransparency of the oversight of new medications. Two weeks ago, the \nFDA announced the creation of a new Drug Safety Oversight Board to \nmonitor the safety of prescription and over-the-counter drugs on the \nmarket more effectively. This new board is aimed at eliminating the \nconflict of interest found under the current CDER structure as \ndisclosed by Dr. Graham.\n  Other examples of whistle blowers who uncovered government \nmismanagement and threats to public safety include: Ms. Colleen Rowley \nwho disclosed institutional problems at the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation prior to 2001 which affected national security, Mr. \nRichard Foster, who sought to disclose the actual cost of pending \nMedicare legislation to Congress, and Border Patrol Agents Mark Hall \nand Bob Lindemann, who revealed security lapses at our northern border \nimmediately after September 11, 2001.\n  In spite of the positive changes resulting from their disclosures, we \nare concerned that the very public struggles these individuals have \nendured after alerting Americans to waste, fraud, abuse, and security \nand health violations in the Federal Government may discourage others \nfrom coming forward. The root of these struggles lies in part with \nproblems with the current legal structure and interpretation of the \nWhistleblower Protection Act. As a result of recent court decisions, \nlegitimate whistleblowers have been denied adequate protection from \nretaliatory I practices. In fact, Federal whistleblowers have prevailed \non the merits of their claims before the Federal Circuit Court of \nAppeals, which has sole jurisdiction over Federal employee \nwhistleblower appeals, only once since 1994.\n  To address these issues, our legislation would clarify congressional \nintent regarding the scope of protection provided to whistleblowers; \nprovide for an independent determination as to whether a whistleblower \nwas retaliated against by the revocation of his or her security \nclearance; establish a pilot program to suspend the Federal Circuit \nCourt of Appeals' monopoly on Federal employee whistleblower cases for \na period of five years; and provide the Office of Special Counsel, \nwhich is charged with representing the interests of Federal \nwhistleblowers, the authority to file amicus briefs with federal courts \nin support of whistleblowers.\n  Several of the provisions in the legislation reflect our efforts to \naddress concerns raised by the Justice Department. While the Department \nstill has objections to the intent of the legislation, partially \nbecause of its role in representing the interests of the alleged \nretaliatory agencies, I will continue to work with the Department. I am \noptimistic that we can reach an agreement on this good government \nmeasure in the near future.\n  Congress has a duty to provide strong and meaningful protections for \nFederal whistleblowers. Only when Federal employees are confident that \nthey will not face retaliation will they feel comfortable coming \nforward to disclose information that can be used to improve government \noperations, our national security, and the health of our citizens. I \nlook forward to working with my colleagues to make this goal a reality.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord as follows:\n\n                                 S. 494\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to impose sanctions against perpetrators of crimes \nagainst humanity in Darfur, Sudan, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise to talk about the Darfur \nAccountability Act. This is an issue that I and a number of my \ncolleagues have as much passion about and as much conviction and \nconcern as anything that we could speak about on this floor. As we \nstand here today, 225,000, maybe more, Darfurians in the Sudan have \ndied over the last 2 years. A million and three quarters are displaced, \nliving in camps. Senator Brownback is a cosponsor of the Darfur \nAccountability Act, along with Senators DeWine, Talent, Dodd, Durbin, \nFeingold, and Lieberman--a bipartisan basis. All believe strongly and \npassionately that we need to act now.\n  This bill, which we will be introducing today, provides the tools, \nthe authorities to confront the crisis of humanity that is taking place \nin Darfur. It can be a reflection of our Nation's commitment to live up \nto the most solemn promise of our time and our Nation's values--to \nnever stand by quietly while genocide goes forth, while genocide rages \nin a part of the world. ``Never again'' is the rallying cry we have all \nheard from the tragedy of World War II, from the response and \nunderstanding of the tragedy of Rwanda and genocides across history. \nMan's horrific treatment of his fellow man in genocide must be stood up \nagainst, must be pushed back against. We must say no.\n  It has been more than 7 months since the resolution introduced by \nSenator Brownback and myself declaring the atrocities in Darfur to be \ndeclared genocide passed the Senate. It has been more than 7 months \nsince the House of Representatives passed a similar resolution. And it \nhas been 6 months since Secretary of State Colin Powell made the same \ndeclaration.\n  Genocide continues. Just 1 month ago a U.N. commission confirmed a \nlitany of atrocities that have become all too familiar in this \nsituation:\n\n       Government forces and militias conducted indiscriminate \n     attacks, including killing of civilians, torture, enforced \n     disappearances, destruction of villages, rape and other forms \n     of sexual violence, pillaging and forced displacement \n     throughout Darfur.\n\n  It has been going on for 2 years. The report stated that the \natrocities were ``conducted on a widespread and systematic basis,'' and \nthat the ``magnitude and large-scale nature of some crimes against \nhumanity, as well as their consistency over a long period of time, \nnecessarily imply that these\n\n[[Page S1939]]\n\ncrimes result from a central planning operation.''\n  This is public policy in the Sudan--public policy. Maybe more \ncompelling is a series of articles, two of which I will put into the \nRecord, that are reflective of the public and transparent and dogged \ncoverage by a New York Times columnist, Nicholas Kristof, which \ndocument completely the nature of the atrocities going on, including, \nunfortunately, some of the pictorial efforts that bring forth the \ncertainty that genocide is taking place.\n  I will submit a column written on February 23, ``The Secret Genocide \nArchive,'' which carries pictures in the New York Times of some of the \noutcomes of our failure to act. Then there is a second column which I \nwill put into the Record. It is in today's paper, March 2, 2005, ``The \nAmerican Witness,'' where a U.S. marine on the ground, a captain in the \nMarine Corps, is citing and stating and documenting the continuation of \nthis tragedy in the lives of these people in Darfur.\n  I ask unanimous consent that these articles be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Mar. 2, 2005]\n\n                          The American Witness\n\n                        (By Nicholas D. Kristof)\n\n       American soldiers are trained to shoot at the enemy. \n     They're prepared to be shot at. But what young men like Brian \n     Steidle are not equipped for is witnessing a genocide but \n     being unable to protect the civilians pleading for help.\n       If President Bush wants to figure out whether the U.S. \n     should stand more firmly against the genocide in Darfur, I \n     suggest that he invite Mr. Steidle to the White House to give \n     a briefing. Mr. Steidle, a 28-year-old former Marine captain, \n     was one of just three American military advisers for the \n     African Union monitoring team in Darfur--and he is bursting \n     with frustration.\n       ``Every single day you go out to see another burned \n     village, and more dead bodies,'' he said. ``And the \n     children--you see 6-month-old babies that have been shot, and \n     3-year-old kids with their faces smashed in with rifle butts. \n     And you just have to stand there and write your reports.''\n       While journalists and aid workers are sharply limited in \n     their movements in Darfur, Mr. Steidle and the monitors \n     traveled around by truck and helicopter to investigate \n     massacres by the Sudanese government and the janjaweed \n     militia it sponsors. They have sometimes been shot at, and \n     once his group was held hostage, but they have persisted and \n     become witnesses to systematic crimes against humanity.\n       So is it really genocide?\n       ``I have no doubt about that,'' Mr. Steidle said. ``It's a \n     systematic cleansing of peoples by the Arab chiefs there. And \n     when you talk to them, that's what they tell you. They're \n     very blunt about it. One day we met a janjaweed leader and he \n     said, `Unless you get back four camels that were stolen in \n     2003, then we're going to go to these four villages and burn \n     the villages, rape the women, kill everyone.' And they did.''\n       The African Union doesn't have the troops, firepower or \n     mandate to actually stop the slaughter, just to monitor it. \n     Mr. Steidle said his single most frustrating moment came in \n     December when the Sudanese government and the janjaweed \n     attacked the village of Labado, which had 25,000 inhabitants. \n     Mr. Steidle and his unit flew to the area in helicopters, but \n     a Sudanese general refused to let them enter the village--and \n     also refused to stop the attack.\n       ``It was extremely frustrating--seeing the village burn, \n     hearing gunshots, not being able to do anything,'' Mr. \n     Steidle said. ``The entire village is now gone. It's a big \n     black spot on the earth.''\n       When Sudan's government is preparing to send bombers or \n     helicopter gunships to attack an African village, it shuts \n     down the cell phone system so no one can send out warnings. \n     Thus the international monitors know when a massacre is about \n     to unfold. But there's usually nothing they can do.\n       The West, led by the Bush administration, is providing food \n     and medical care that is keeping hundreds of thousands of \n     people alive. But we're managing the genocide, not halting \n     it.\n       ``The world is failing Darfur,'' said Jan Egeland, the U.N. \n     under secretary general for humanitarian affairs. ``We're \n     only playing the humanitarian card, and we're just witnessing \n     the massacres.''\n       President Bush is pushing for sanctions, but European \n     countries like France are disgracefully cool to the idea--and \n     China is downright hostile, playing the same supportive role \n     for the Darfur genocide that it did for the Khmer Rouge \n     genocide.\n       Mr. Steidle has just quit his job with the African Union, \n     but he plans to continue working in Darfur to do his part to \n     stand up to the killers. Most of us don't have to go to that \n     extreme of risking our lives in Darfur--we just need to get \n     off the fence and push our government off, too.\n       At one level, I blame President Bush--and, even more, the \n     leaders of European, Arab and African nations--for their \n     passivity. But if our leaders are acquiescing in genocide, \n     that's because we citizens are passive, too. If American \n     voters cared about Darfur's genocide as much as about, say, \n     the Michael Jackson trial, then our political system would \n     respond. One useful step would be the passage of the Darfur \n     Accountability Act, to be introduced today by Senators Jon \n     Corzine and Sam Brownback. The legislation calls for such \n     desperately needed actions as expanding the African Union \n     force and establishing a military no-fly zone to stop Sudan \n     from bombing civilians.\n       As Martin Luther King Jr. put it: ``Man's inhumanity to man \n     is not only perpetrated by the vitriolic actions of those who \n     are bad. It is also perpetrated by the vitiating inaction of \n     those who are good.''\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, we are truly at a historic moment. The \nU.N. Commission confirmed that these atrocities were continuing even as \nit was doing its investigation. By the way, we just released from the \nU.S. State Department a report on human rights practices in countries \naround the world. The February 28 report reconfirmed our own \nGovernment's view that what is taking place is genocide.\n  We bear the responsibility that came out of the Holocaust to remember \nthe horrors that lead to genocide. That is why we passed the genocide \nconvention, and it is time to act. That is what this accountability act \nis all about. It has a lot of detail in it. But the fact is, it is to \nget us up and moving. I could use a little more graphic language. We \nhave no right to stand by while human life is being taken day after day \nand displacement is taking place day after day. All over this country, \npeople of faith of all denominations, student groups, and people from \nall walks of life are speaking out about this in our churches, our \ncommunity centers, everywhere. They expect our Government and the \ninternational community to act. The time to act is now.\n  Let me describe the legislation, if I may. First, it reconfirms that \ngenocide continues in Darfur. Last week, Human Rights reported new \naccounts of rapes, tortures, and mutilations from eyewitnesses. This \nneeds to be dealt with. There is little doubt whatsoever that this \ncontinues. Again, I refer to the Kristof articles, which are very \ngraphic in their explanation. Reflecting on time, I will not go through \nthe details. There are many of these accounts.\n  There is no reason to turn our backs on this issue. Remember the \nimperative: Never again. This legislation offers specifics about how \nthe genocide should be stopped. It calls for a military no-fly zone in \nDarfur. This discussion about no-fly zones has been going on for the \nbetter part of a year. It is time to make sure that we as an \ninternational community, as a nation, stand up and say, let's implement \nthat.\n  Recent reports state that as recently as January, the Government of \nSudan used aircraft and helicopters to impose its desire in \nimplementing its genocide on the people of Darfur along with the \njingaweit militia, which are notorious about implementing this.\n  The legislation also lays out the report for the African Union \nmission in Darfur. In September of last year, the Senate passed an \namendment by Senator DeWine and myself that sets aside $75 million in \naid to the African Union so they could accelerate their monitoring and \nassistance on the ground in Darfur. So far, we have begun to use some \nof those resources. I think at this point it is about $20 million. \nUnfortunately, the authorization was for 3,300 African Union troops on \nthe ground, but there are about 1,800 there today. This is 7 months \nafter our efforts to get this done. We need to stop the killing now. \nThat means we need to get the troops on the ground now; we have to \nspend the money now. It is absolutely time that we stand up and take \nnotice and move on this issue.\n  The legislation also provides specifics about what should be done in \na new U.N. Security Council resolution, including sanctions that have \npreviously been threatened by the council but never imposed. For \ninstance, we have an arms embargo against the government in Darfur. We \ndon't have an arms embargo against the Government of Sudan. We have one \nin Darfur. So they can get the guns and military equipment into \nKhartoum, and I guess we think somehow they are not going to use it \nwhere they are actually taking the lives of the people in Darfur. It is \ncrazy that we have such a limited and ineffectual arms embargo on \nSudan. We need to act. It is clear that\n\n[[Page S1940]]\n\nwe needed it last summer, and it is clear that we need it today.\n  I was offered the opportunity to visit Darfur last August during that \n30-day period when the U.N. Security Council was examining whether \nSudan was moving to correct some of the problems, get control of the \njingaweit, and actually respond to the international community's \nimperative that they change their actions. It was clear then that the \nonly thing that was moving the Sudanese Government was the transparency \nthat both journalists and the international community were providing \nthe people who were on the ground, but they had no real interest in \nstopping the jingaweit or the tragedy on the ground in Darfur. None. It \nwas only pressure from the outside that was going to have any impact on \nmoving forward.\n  Unfortunately, from that moment on, we have stepped back. We said we \nwere going to do things, and we did not. Guess what. The tragedy \ncontinues and has accelerated in many places, particularly south \nDarfur. It is time to act.\n  I will save going through the rest of the pieces of legislation, but \nI hope my colleagues will keep in mind that we have had over 200,000 \ndeaths and one and three-quarter million people displaced, more or \nless. Nobody is certain of the numbers. Estimates are that 10,000 \npeople die a month in Darfur. Do we have to wake up and understand that \nwe have ``Rwanda 2'' on our hands to act? Do we have to have some \nincredible tragedy at a single point in time for us to act? It is time \nto put down serious accountability requirements on the Government of \nSudan and to act to stop the killing in Darfur. I can only say that \nthere is nothing that reflects our moral values in this country more \nthan standing up to genocide. Our humanity is being challenged, the \nvery essence of who we are as human beings. Genocide is evil. It should \nbe stopped, and we should remember the imperative: Never again.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me salute the Senator from New Jersey, \nMr. Corzine, as well as Senator Brownback, a Democrat and a Republican, \none from the east coast and another from the Midwest, for bringing to \nthe Senate floor today the issue of Darfur. They have been leaders in \nthis issue. I can recall Senator Corzine as the first Member of the \nSenate standing up and making a point many months ago about the \nsenseless killing going on in the Sudan and the fact that the United \nStates could not turn a blind eye to this issue. He returned to the \nfloor today with the same message. I commend him for his humanitarian \ncommitment to the poor people who are losing their lives in this \nconflict.\n  A little over a week ago in Chicago, IL, we had the visit of a rather \nfamous man. He was a man who none of us knew and, frankly, could not \neven pronounce his name. He came to tell a story. His name is Paul \nRusesabagina. He is the manager of the hotel in Hotel Rwanda, which has \nbecome a very famous film. He had a luxury hotel in Rwanda in the midst \nof the terrible genocide. Because of his personal courage and the fact \nthat he was willing to stand up, he saved over 1,200 lives of people \nwho sought refuge in the hotel, who otherwise would have been hacked to \ndeath by machete during the Rwanda genocide. He came to Chicago, to St. \nSabinas Church on the South Side, where Father Michael Flager was his \nhost. He told the story of Rwanda. It wasn't just a reminiscence of \nhistory; he told us that we needed to look today to the genocides we \nface in the world. He pointed specifically to Darfur in Sudan.\n  He asked us what was asked of many during the Rwanda genocide: What \nwill you do now that you know that innocent people are being killed by \nthe hundreds of thousands? What will you do? Will you ignore it because \nit is so far away? Will you ignore it because it is Africa? Will you \nignore it because it may call for sacrifice on the part of U.S. \nleadership?\n  It is a challenge he made to us, an interesting challenge from a man \nwho literally risked his life to save others during a genocide. He \nasked us, in our comfort in America, whether we were willing to risk \nanything to save these victims in Darfur. He touched my soul, and I \ntold him that when I get back to Washington, I will take to the floor \nof the Senate and raise this issue as often as I can. I will try \neverything I can find to move the United States into a stronger \nposition of leadership.\n  Yesterday, President Bush invited about 20 leaders in Congress to the \nWhite House for a briefing on his trip to Europe. It was an excellent \nbriefing. We were allowed to ask questions at the end. I asked the \nPresident, with Steven Hadley close at hand: What are we going to do \nabout Darfur? Sadly, the response was what I have heard over and over \nagain from so many different sources: We are going to count on the \nAfrican Union, a group of soldiers from Africa who are moving into the \nregion. How many soldiers are moving into this region where helpless \npeople are being killed? Their best estimates are 3,000 soldiers. How \nbig is this region? It is about the size of the State of Texas. How in \nthe world can we expect to have an impact on this senseless killing?\n  That is why I am supporting this Darfur Accountability Act. This bill \nwe are pushing seeks to prod the world to do what it needs to do to \nstop the genocide in Sudan. ``Genocide'' is a word this is rarely used \nin human history. There have been genocides against the Armenian people \nand the Jewish people during the Holocaust, perhaps in Pol Pot's times \nin Cambodia, and other times we can point to. Rarely do we use the \nword. It is a word that is freighted with responsibility. You cannot \njust say there is genocide in some part of the world and isn't that a \nshame. We signed a genocide treaty that said once we detect a genocide, \nwe go to international organizations--the United States does--and \ndemand action. So using the word ``genocide,'' as the Bush \nadministration has done, is a good thing because it prods us to do \nsomething, but it is a challenge that we must meet on something this \ntimely and important.\n  This act calls for the United States to call on the United Nations to \nimmediately take action in Darfur. Some will say, well, that is \npointless; Russia and China will veto that action in the Security \nCouncil. Regardless, we should force the issue to a vote. We should \nconfront the Russians and the Chinese and ask them what they would do \nin light of this senseless killing.\n  The horrific stories keep piling up. The jingaweit, the armed \nmilitias, running amok in Darfur are killing innocent people right and \nleft. Sudanese aircraft strafed a village in southern Darfur, killing \nmore than 100 men, women, and children, in January, according to Human \nRights Watch. The world has witnessed this in Darfur. We know it has \nhappened. We must do something about it. That is why I join my \ncolleague in this request that we take action now, move this Darfur \nAccountability Act, join Senator Corzine, join Senator Brownback, and \nmake this happen.\n  Let me also say this. My closest friend in politics was Paul Simon, \nwho preceded me in the Senate. He spoke out on the Rwandan genocide \nwhen very few did. He called on the Clinton administration to do \nsomething, and they did not. They look back now with sorrow and some \nshame that they did not. President Clinton has said that. We do not \nwant to be in that same situation.\n  The United States should not be a guilty bystander in this genocide. \nWe will be guilty if we do not act. We will be bystanders if we come up \nwith excuses to do nothing. We need to take the risk to save these \npeople, as Paul Rusesabagina did in Rwanda. We can step in today and \nsave and protect innocent lives, call on the United Nations to act, and \nif they fail to act, take the next step, even if it involves \ncommitments from the United States which may not be immediately \npopular.\n  I think the American people will understand. We are a compassionate, \ncaring people who will not stand idly by in the face of a genocide as \nwe did during Rwanda.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 495\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S1941]]\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) On July 22, 2004, the House of Representatives and the \n     Senate declared that the atrocities occurring in Darfur, \n     Sudan are genocide.\n       (2) On September 9, 2004, Secretary of State Colin L. \n     Powell stated before the Committee on Foreign Relations of \n     the Senate, ``[w]hen we reviewed the evidence compiled by our \n     team, along with other information available to the State \n     Department, we concluded that genocide has been committed in \n     Darfur and that the Government of Sudan and the [Janjaweed] \n     bear responsibility--and genocide may still be occurring''.\n       (3) President George W. Bush, in an address before the \n     United Nations General Assembly on September 21, 2004, \n     stated, ``[a]t this hour, the world is witnessing terrible \n     suffering and horrible crimes in the Darfur region of Sudan, \n     crimes my government has concluded are genocide''.\n       (4) On July 30, 2004, the United Nations Security Council \n     passed Security Council Resolution 1556, calling upon the \n     Government of Sudan to disarm the Janjaweed militias and to \n     apprehend and bring to justice Janjaweed leaders and their \n     associates who have incited and carried out violations of \n     human rights and international humanitarian law and carried \n     out other atrocities in the Darfur region.\n       (5) On September 18, 2004, the United Nations Security \n     Council passed Security Council Resolution 1564, determining \n     that the Government of Sudan had failed to meet its \n     obligations under Security Council Resolution 1556, calling \n     for a military flight ban in and over the Darfur region, \n     demanding the names of Janjaweed militiamen disarmed and \n     arrested for verification, establishing an International \n     Commission of Inquiry into violations of international \n     humanitarian and human rights laws, and threatening sanctions \n     should the Government of Sudan fail to fully comply with \n     Security Council Resolutions 1556 and 1564.\n       (6) United Nations Security Council Resolution 1564 \n     declares that if the Government of Sudan ``fails to comply \n     fully'' with Security Council Resolutions 1556 and 1564, the \n     Security Council shall consider taking ``additional \n     measures'' against the Government of Sudan ``as contemplated \n     in Article 41 of the Charter of the United Nations, such as \n     actions to affect Sudan's petroleum sector or individual \n     members of the Government of Sudan, in order to take \n     effective action to obtain such full compliance and \n     cooperation''.\n       (7) United Nations Security Council Resolution 1564 also \n     ``welcomes and supports the intention of the African Union to \n     enhance and augment its monitoring mission in Darfur'' and \n     ``urges member states to support the African Union in these \n     efforts, including by providing all equipment, logistical, \n     financial, material, and other resources necessary to support \n     the rapid expansion of the African Union Mission''.\n       (8) On February 1, 2005, the United Nations released the \n     Report of the International Commission of Inquiry on Darfur \n     to the United Nations Secretary-General, dated January 25, \n     2005, which stated that, ``[g]overnment forces and militias \n     conducted indiscriminate attacks, including killing of \n     civilians, torture, enforced disappearances, destruction of \n     villages, rape and other forms of sexual violence, pillaging \n     and forced displacement throughout Darfur'', that such ``acts \n     were conducted on a widespread and systematic basis, and \n     therefore may amount to crimes against humanity'', and that \n     the ``magnitude and large-scale nature of some crimes against \n     humanity as well as their consistency over a long period of \n     time, necessarily imply that these crimes result from a \n     central planning operation''.\n       (9) The Report of the International Commission of Inquiry \n     on Darfur to the United Nations Secretary-General notes that, \n     pursuant to its mandate and in the course of its work, the UN \n     Commission collected information relating to individual \n     perpetrators of acts constituting ``violations of \n     international human rights law and international humanitarian \n     law, including crimes against humanity and war crimes'' and \n     that the UN Commission has delivered to the Secretary-General \n     of the United Nations a sealed file of those named by the UN \n     Commission with the recommendation that the ``file be handed \n     over to a competent Prosecutor''.\n\n     SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the atrocities unfolding in Darfur, Sudan, have been \n     and continue to be genocide;\n       (2) the United States should immediately seek passage at \n     the United Nations Security Council of a resolution that--\n       (A) requires member states to freeze the property and \n     assets of, deny visas to, and deny entry to--\n       (i) those named by the UN Commission;\n       (ii) family members of those named by the UN Commission; \n     and\n       (iii) any associates of those named by the UN Commission to \n     whom assets or property of those named by the UN Commission \n     were transferred on or after June 11, 2004;\n       (B) urges member states to submit to the Security Council \n     the name of any individual that the government of any such \n     member state believes is or has been planning, carrying out, \n     responsible for, or otherwise involved in genocide, war \n     crimes, or crimes against humanity in Darfur, along with \n     evidence supporting such belief so that the Security Council \n     may consider imposing sanctions described in subparagraph (A) \n     against those individuals described in such subparagraph;\n       (C) imposes sanctions or additional measures against the \n     Government of Sudan, including sanctions that will affect the \n     petroleum sector in Sudan, individual members of the \n     Government of Sudan, and entities controlled or owned by \n     officials of the government of Sudan or the National Congress \n     Party in Sudan, that will remain in effect until such time \n     as--\n       (i) humanitarian organizations are granted full, unimpeded \n     access to Darfur;\n       (ii) the Government of Sudan cooperates with humanitarian \n     relief efforts, carries out activities to demobilize and \n     disarm Janjaweed militias and any other militias supported or \n     created by the Government of Sudan, and cooperates fully with \n     efforts to bring to justice the individuals responsible for \n     genocide, war crimes, or crimes against humanity in Darfur;\n       (iii) the Government of Sudan cooperates fully with the \n     African Union, the United Nations, and all other observer, \n     monitoring, and protection missions mandated to operate in \n     Sudan;\n       (iv) the Government of Sudan permits the safe and voluntary \n     return of displaced persons and refugees to their homes and \n     rebuilds the communities destroyed in the violence in Darfur;

and\n       (I) supports African Union efforts to negotiate peace talks \n     between the Government of Sudan and rebels in Darfur, calls \n     on the Government of Sudan and rebels in Darfur to abide by \n     their obligations under the N'Djamena Ceasefire Agreement of \n     April 8, 2004 and subsequent agreements, and urges parties to \n     engage in peace talks without preconditions and seek to \n     resolve the conflict;\n       (3) the United States should work with other nations to \n     ensure effective efforts to freeze the property and assets of \n     and deny visas and entry to--\n       (A) those named by the UN Commission;\n       (B) any individuals the United States believes is or has \n     been planning, carrying out, responsible for, or otherwise \n     involved in genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity \n     in Darfur;\n       (C) family members of any person described in subparagraphs \n     (A) or (B); and\n       (D) any associates of any such person to whom assets or \n     property of such person were transferred on or after June 11, \n     2004;\n       (4) the United States should support accountability through \n     action by the United Nations Security Council, pursuant to \n     Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, to ensure \n     the prompt prosecution and adjudication in a competent \n     international court of justice of those named by the UN \n     Commission;\n       (5) the United States should not provide assistance to the \n     Government of Sudan, other than assistance necessary for the \n     implementation of the Sudan North-South Peace\n\n[[Page S1942]]\n\n     Agreement, the support of the southern regional government in \n     Sudan, or for humanitarian purposes in Sudan, unless the \n     President certifies and reports to Congress that--\n       (A) humanitarian organizations are being granted full, \n     unimpeded access to Darfur and the Government of Sudan is \n     providing full cooperation with humanitarian efforts;\n       (B) concrete, sustained steps are being taken toward \n     demobilizing and disarming Janjaweed militias and any other \n     militias supported or created by the Government of Sudan;\n       (C) the Government of Sudan is cooperating fully with \n     efforts to bring to justice those responsible for genocide, \n     war crimes, or crimes against humanity in Darfur;\n       (D) the Government of Sudan cooperates fully with the \n     African Union, the United Nations, and all other observer, \n     monitoring, and protection missions mandated to operate in \n     Sudan;\n       (E) the Government of Sudan permits the safe and voluntary \n     return of displaced persons and refugees to their homes and \n     rebuilds the communities destroyed in the violence in Darfur;

IMPOSITION OF SANCTIONS.\n\n       (a) Freezing Assets.--At such time as the United States has \n     access to the names of those named by the UN Commission, the \n     President shall take such action as may be necessary to \n     immediately freeze the funds and other assets belonging to \n     anyone so named, their family members, and any associates of \n     those so named to whom assets or property of those so named \n     were transferred on or after June 11, 2004, including \n     requiring that any United States financial institution \n     holding such funds and assets promptly report those funds and \n     assets to the Office of Foreign Assets Control.\n       (b) Visa Ban.--Beginning at such times as the United States \n     has access to the names of those named by the UN Commission, \n     the President shall deny visas and entry to--\n       (1) those named by the UN Commission;\n       (2) the family members of those named by the UN Commission; \n     and\n       (3) anyone the President determines has been, is, or may be \n     planning, carrying out, responsible for, or otherwise \n     involved in crimes against humanity, war crimes, or genocide \n     in Darfur, Sudan.\n       (c) Asset Reporting Requirement.--Not later than 14 days \n     after a decision to freeze the property or assets of, or deny \n     a visa or entry to, any person under this section, the \n     President shall report the name of such person to the \n     appropriate congressional committees.\n       (d) Notification of Waivers of Sanctions.--Not later than \n     30 days before waiving the provisions of any sanctions \n     currently in force with regard to Sudan, the President shall \n     submit to the appropriate congressional committees a report \n     describing the waiver and the reasons therefor.\n\n     SEC. 6.

Mr. President, today with several bipartisan \ncolleagues, Senator Corzine and I introduced the Darfur Accountability \nAct of 2005. For nearly a year, this body has been aware of the ongoing \ngenocide in Sudan. Last July we declared genocide in Darfur, followed \nshortly thereafter by the same declaration by former Secretary of State \nColin Powell. Yet no punitive measure has been taken by the \ninternational community against the Government of Sudan for these \negregious human rights violations. Some sources estimate that as many \nas 400,000 people have died as a result, and nearly 2 million have been \ndisplaced from their homes.\n  Yesterday I spoke on the Senate floor in an attempt to display the \nface of genocide. Photographs of scorched bodies, castrated men, dead \nchildren, and burned villages were provided to me by Nicholas Kristof \nof the New York Times. These photos do nothing less than display the \ncruel impunity of those committing genocide. The haunting reality is \nthat the international community has failed on their promise of ``never \nagain.''\n  The United Nations should take immediate steps to end this genocide \nand Kofi Annan should lead the Security Council to pass a strong, \nmeaningful resolution that will immediately change the situation on the \nground. There is no longer an excuse; we must call this what this is, \nand we must immediately act to prevent further pillaging and death. I \nhave called on Annan several times to lead or leave. He should pass a \nresolution with mechanisms to see that the impunity ends and if he \nfails to do so, resign in moral protest at the international \ncommunity's inaction and complacency.\n  Our bill, the Darfur Accountability Act of 2005, calls for several \nkey measures to be taken, including: a multilateral arms embargo to \ninclude the government of Sudan; a no fly zone; multilateral sanctions; \ntargeted sanctions including travel bans and the freezing of assets of \ncriminals; accelerated assistance to AU monitoring troops, and several \nother items that will secure a peaceful Darfur.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join us in moving this bill through \nCongress. We do not have days or weeks to spare when millions of lives \nare in jeopardy. We cannot grant the government of\n\n[[Page S1943]]\n\nSudan and the janjaweed more time to execute the African tribes in \nDarfur. I look forward to working with Senator Corzine and other \ncolleagues to see passage of this bill immediately.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SALAZAR:\n  S. 496. A bill to provide permanent funding for the payment in lieu \nof taxes program, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SALAZAR:\n  S. 497. A bill to revitalize our nation's rural communities by \nexpanding broadband services; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise to speak about two bills I am \nintroducing today and to speak out in support of rural Colorado and \nrural America. The two bills--one to increase investment in broadband \ntechnology in rural areas, and another to permanently fund the payment \nin lieu of taxes program--are the first bills I am introducing as a \nSenator. I am proud they are both targeted at rural Colorado.\n  Over 400 years ago, in 1598, my family helped found the oldest city \nin what is now these United States. They named the city Santa Fe--the \nCity of Holy Faith--because they knew the hand of God would guide them \nthrough the struggles of survival in the ages ahead.\n  For the next four centuries, that faith in their future guided them \nto overcome extremely painful and challenging times. As humble and poor \nfarmers, the circumstances of their lives forged the priceless and \ntireless values of my father Henry and mother Emma. And they instilled \nthose values in their children.\n  My family has now farmed the same lands in southern Colorado, 110 \nmiles north of Santa Fe, for almost 150 years. On that ranch, we did \nnot have a telephone, and the power lines did not reach us until 1981. \nAlthough we were poor in material goods, we were rich in spirit. My \nparents were part of the World's ``greatest generation''--my father a \nproud veteran of World War II and my mother a proud servant in the War \nDepartment. Although neither had a college degree, they taught us about \nthe values and the promise of America. All eight of their children \nbecame first-generation college graduates, inspired by their dedication \nto God, family, community, and country.\n  As Colorado's U.S. Senator, I am proud of my values and roots in \nrural Colorado. Rural America is the heart of our great Nation.\n  The values my parents taught me are the fundamental values that make \nthis country the place I am privileged to call home.\n  Unfortunately, the America where I grew up is vanishing, left behind \nby a Washington DC that has lost touch with what is important to the \npeople of the heartland. I fear that rural Colorado, like the rest of \nrural America, has become ``the forgotten America.''\n  Rural America has given up its sons and daughters to the cause of \nfreedom without hesitation and in numbers that far exceed its \nproportion of the country's population. It has worked quietly to put \nfood on our tables, and remains humbly grounded, seeking neither praise \nnor thanks.\n  Yet when the President reported on the State of the Union, there was \nnot a word on the state of the more than 3,000 counties that make up \nrural America--not a word. And in the administration's budget, the \nprograms and investments vital to those communities--PILT, block \ngrants, conservation programs, investments in animal and food safety, \nand investments in technology, schools and law enforcement--were \ndrastically cut.\n  Last week, I traveled nearly 2,000 miles to every corner of Colorado \nand convened 17 meetings with elected officials representing Colorado's \n64 counties.\n  In those meetings, I heard the state of rural America in the words of \nthe people who are fighting for their families everyday.\n  The state of rural America is sadly the state of the forgotten \nAmerica.\n  In rural Colorado, residents face lower incomes and are far more \nlikely to be unemployed than people in urban and suburban areas.\n  In Crowley County, east of Pueblo, there is only one nurse \npractitioner to serve a county of nearly 6,000 people. If you get sick \nin Crowley County, you have three choices: wait, go to the emergency \nroom, or hope you get better.\n  In Routt County, veterans have to travel nearly 200 miles to Grand \nJunction to see a doctor in the VA clinic. A few months ago, there was \nno waiting list to see a doctor. Now, there's a waiting list of 400, \nwhich means veterans in western Colorado wait 5 months to see a doctor.\n  The Dolores County Sheriff, Jerry Martin, has to make hiring \ndecisions based not on public security demands but on the ability of \nhis department to provide health care to the prospective employee. \nHealth care premiums have risen 20 percent every year the last 3 years \nin Dolores County.\n  Across the State, people told me that their health care premiums \ndwarf their mortgage payments because in many cases they pay over \n$1,000 per month for health insurance for their families.\n  Between 1996 and 2000, one in three of our rural schools saw its \nenrollment drop more than 10 percent.\n  Though they continue to excel on State tests, too many of our rural \nschools have been forced to divert valuable resources to fulfill the \nunfunded mandates of No Child Left Behind.\n  In Kiowa, Moffat, and Custer Counties, our teachers are paid much \nless than teachers in the big cities. In Kit Carson County, where \nteachers sometimes teach two and three subjects, only half of our \nteachers right now would meet new Federal standards requiring them to \nbe certified for each subject.\n  And in the town of Rico, half of Main Street is boarded up: there's a \nliquor store, but not much else. According to the Kansas City Federal \nReserve Bank, that may be part of a larger trend: Main Street in rural \nColorado is losing its storefronts at an alarming rate.\n  Compare those needs to the budget the Administration recently \nproposed.\n  While we are facing a shortage of qualified and trained health care \nemployees, the administration budget this year cut health professions \ntraining by almost two thirds, $290 million.\n  While our State tries to deal with a devastating budget crisis, the \nAdministration dramatically reduced funding for the Community \nDevelopment Block Grants on which towns, from Greeley to Grand Junction \nto Denver, depend.\n  For the fifth year in a row, the Administration's budget fails to \nfulfill the funding promises made in the No Child Left Behind law, but \nstill heaps mandates on local schools.\n  Moreover, the proposed budget eliminates low-interest loans for \nstudents who have the grades but can't afford to go to college and \neliminates funding for vocational training that many rural Colorado \nstudents use.\n  The proposed budget cuts $250 million from one of the most successful \nsmall business investment programs and decimates USDA investments in \nrural economic development.\n  While we combat methamphetamine production and invest precious \nresources in meth lab clean up, the budget cuts Safe and Drug Free \nSchool grants, the COPS program by nearly $500 million, and State and \nlocal homeland security training programs by 60 percent.\n  I want to propose two small steps in my effort to reinvest in rural \nAmerica. In coming months I intend to introduce measures to strengthen \nrural law enforcement, revitalize rural health care, invest in Main \nStreet, strengthen rural education, help ensure efficient and equitable \nsharing of water resources and underscore the values that shape every \nrural community in Colorado.\n  The first bill is on the PILT program. I know that education in rural \nAmerica is funded through a variety of means, including through \nresources passed to rural counties through the Payment in Lieu of Taxes \nprogram.\n  The idea behind the PILT program is simple. It makes sure that local \ncommunities in States like Colorado--States that have seen large parts \nof land set aside by the Federal Government for public use--do not lose \nvaluable resources from foregone property taxes. Those resources fund \nprograms from education to law enforcement.\n  Unfortunately, this year the administration's budget is again \nproposing to cut that funding. Thanks to the efforts of my Democratic \nand Republican colleagues, such as Senator Bingaman, some of that \nfunding has been won back over the last several years, and I\n\n[[Page S1944]]\n\nam hopeful we will do so again this year.\n  But our local communities should not have to wait and wonder every \nyear whether their resources for schools, roads and law enforcement \nwill make it into the budget, and that is why I am introducing a bill \nto make permanent the funding for the payment in lieu of taxes program.\n  I am also introducing a bill to increase investment in broadband \ntechnology in rural communities. Bringing broadband to our rural \nschools will give our students there access to technology that millions \nof other students take for granted. With broadband will come world \nclass research and access to AP courses at Colorado's universities. And \nwith broadband we will see the economic development for which rural \nColorado has been waiting.\n  The benefits of this investment do not stop in education and \nbusiness. Telehealth is increasingly vital in rural Colorado, held back \nin some cases by the lack of investment in infrastructure. That same \ninfrastructure limits investment opportunities in rural communities.\n  With this bill I am building on the hard work of others and saying \nthat it is long past time for us to invest in the world class broadband \nthat rural communities need and are right to expect. My bill does that \nin three ways.\n  First, it will establish our Nation's first Rural Broadband Office to \ncoordinate all Federal Government resources as they relate to \nbroadband.\n  Second, it will help broadband providers keep pace with our rapidly \nchanging technology.\n  And third, it calls on the Congress to live up to its responsibility \nto fully fund rural utilities.\n  It has been a long road that has carried me from that ranch in the \nSan Luis Valley, growing up as one of eight siblings and proudly \nattending college and law school before having the privilege to serve \nin U.S. Senate.\n  In all of this, I have never forgotten where I come from. In my \noffice, I have a sign on my desk that reads ``No Farms, No Food.'' \nEvery day I look at it, and I am reminded of just how dependent we are \non the people of rural Colorado, and in rural communities all across \nAmerica.\n  At a meeting with leaders from Colorado's farmer and rancher \ncommunity last month, a wheat farmer from southeastern Colorado told me \nthis: ``Senator, you'd never believe how many farmers refuse to go to \nthe doctor when they get sick. It's not that they aren't really sick. \nIt's that they can't afford the doctor.''\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, I do believe that wheat farmer, and I \nknow rural America needs our help.\n  In America, the most powerful, prosperous, idealistic country the \nworld has ever known, we can do better.\n  And protecting that way of life--in our churches and town halls, Main \nStreets and living rooms, ranches and independent drug stores--demands \nit. Together, we can make sure that no one anywhere in this country \nfeels that he is part of a ``Forgotten America'' any longer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I congratulate my colleague from \nColorado. His maiden speech was as brilliant as his life has been. It \nis an honor to serve with him, when I think about the story of his \nfamily and its presence and contribution to this country and the power \nwith which he speaks for those he represents in rural America. This \nwill be one of many speeches that make a great impact on our country. I \nam honored to serve with him and congratulate him on his initial \nvoyage.\n  Mr. SALAZAR.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) transmission networks are the backbone of reliable \n     delivery of electric energy and competitive wholesale power \n     markets;\n       (2) the expansion, enhancement, and improvement of \n     transmission facilities, and rules of the road for using the \n     facilities, are necessary to maintain and improve the \n     reliability of electric service and to enhance competitive \n     wholesale markets across the United States and competitive \n     retail markets that have been adopted by nearly the States;\n       (3) to ensure reliable and efficient expansion, \n     enhancement, and improvement of transmission facilities, the \n     economics of the business of electric transmission and the \n     Federal regulatory structures applicable to the facilities \n     must be improved;\n       (4) Federal electricity regulatory policy should benefit \n     consumers by providing incentives for infrastructure \n     improvement and by removing barriers to efficient \n     competition, and not be dictated by the imposition of market \n     structures or costly mandates;\n       (5) slow, burdensome, or duplicative reviews of utility \n     mergers are a disincentive to the efficient disposition of \n     utility assets needed to ensure a reliable and efficient \n     infrastructure;\n       (6) since efficient competition requires accurate price \n     signals that reflect cost causation, parties that benefit \n     from transmission upgrades should be required to pay for the \n     upgrades;\n       (7) Federal regulation should not override the interests of \n     local consumers or State laws that ensure reliable service \n     and adequate transmission capacity to serve consumers;\n       (8) in regions where the formation of regional transmission \n     organizations or similar entities have been formed \n     voluntarily with oversight or approval by States, the Federal \n     Energy Regulatory Commission should have clear authority to \n     approve applications for the organizations that are \n     consistent with the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 791a et \n     seq.);\n       (9) the States and electricity consumers in each region of \n     the United States, and not the Federal Government, are in the \n     best position to determine how the electric power systems \n     serving their regions should be structured, including whether \n     Regional Transmission Organization formation, traditional \n     vertical integration, or other structures are cost effective \n     for their region; and\n       (10) mandatory reliability rules, developed and enforced by \n     a self-regulating electric reliability organization, are a \n     vital component of a comprehensive policy to ensure a robust \n     and reliable electricity grid.\n\n       TITLE I--RELIABLE AND ECONOMIC TRANSMISSION INFRASTRUCTURE\n\n     SEC. 101.

Res. 55\n\n       Whereas leading reformist and former Chinese Communist \n     Party Secretary General, Zhao Ziyang, died under house arrest \n     in China on January 17, 2005, at the age of 85;\n       Whereas Zhao implemented important agricultural, \n     industrial, and economic reforms in China and rose to the \n     prominent positions of premier and Secretary General within \n     the Communist Party despite criticisms of his capitalist \n     ideals;\n       Whereas, in the early summer of 1989, students gathered in \n     Tiananmen Square to voice their support for democracy and to \n     protest the Communist government that continues to deny them \n     that democracy;\n       Whereas Secretary General Zhao advised against the use of \n     military force to end the pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen \n     Square;\n       Whereas, on May 19, 1989, in Tiananmen Square, Zhao warned \n     the tens of thousands of students clamoring for democracy \n     that the authorities were approaching and urged them to \n     return to their homes; an action that illustrated his \n     sympathy for their cause;\n       Whereas Zhao was consequently relieved of all leadership \n     responsibilities following his actions in Tiananmen Square \n     that summer and was placed under house arrest for the \n     remaining years of his life;\n       Whereas the Government of China remained indecisive \n     regarding a ceremony for Zhao for several days before \n     allowing a relatively modest ceremony at the Babaoshan \n     Revolutionary Cemetery in Beijing, where Zhao was cremated on \n     January 29, 2005;\n       Whereas the Government of China's fear of civil unrest \n     resulted in the prohibition of political dissidents and \n     others from the funeral, and the thousands who were in \n     attendance were surrounded in an intimidating environment \n     without adequate time to mourn and grieve;\n       Whereas news of Zhao's death was announced only in a brief \n     notice by the Communist government and was forbidden to be \n     covered by the radio or national television, while eulogies \n     were erased by censors from memorial websites;\n       Whereas, upon the announcement of Zhao's death, Chinese \n     news agencies were certain to reference the ``serious \n     mistake'' committed by Zhao at what they refer to as a \n     political incident in 1989;\n       Whereas mourning the death of Zhao in the Hong Kong \n     Legislative Council was deemed unconstitutional and lawmakers \n     in Hong Kong were refused the opportunity to observe a moment \n     of silence in honor of his life;\n       Whereas the death of Zhao has renewed the desire of certain \n     Chinese people for a reassessment of the crackdown in 1989 in \n     order to acknowledge the merit of pro-democracy student \n     demonstrations and complaints of government corruption; and\n       Whereas Zhao will continue to serve as a symbol of the \n     dreams and purpose of the 1989 Tiananmen Square \n     demonstration, which survived the Tiananmen massacre but \n     which have still not been realized for the people of China: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes that Zhao Ziyang made an important \n     contribution to the people of China by providing assistance \n     to the students in Tiananmen Square in 1989, and that through \n     this contribution and his decisions to actively seek reform, \n     Zhao remains a symbol of hope for reform and human rights for \n     the people of China;\n       (2) expresses sympathy for Zhao's family and to the people \n     of China who were unable to appropriately mourn his death or \n     to celebrate his life;\n       (3) calls on the Government of China--\n       (A) to release all prisoners of conscience, including those \n     persons still in prison as a result of their participation in \n     the peaceful pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square in \n     1989; and\n       (B) to allow those people exiled on account of their \n     activities to return to live in freedom in China; and\n       (4) stands with the people of China as they strive to \n     improve their way of life and create a government that is \n     truly democratic and respectful of international norms in the \n     area of human rights.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/02/senate-section/article/S1956-5", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1956-S1957]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   DESIGNATING MONTH OF MARCH AS DEEP-VEIN THROMBOSIS AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  Mr. DeMINT.
