Mr. President, the Senate just finished honoring our flag \nwith the Pledge of Allegiance, an innovation we added to the Senate \nproceeding several years ago upon the suggestion and urging of our \nformer colleague, Senator Bob Smith of New Hampshire. As we pay respect \nto those stars and those stripes, the news this morning of the events \nin Iraq bring new strength to the patriotism reflected by the Senate \nfor that flag and, indeed, for our country.\n  Today, our military forces are to be commended for their dedication \nto eradicating the terrorist network in Iraq. Today's success in \neliminating the terrorist, the butcher terrorist, the thuggish \nterrorist, al-Zarqawi, is a sure sign they are on the way to \naccomplishing that goal.\n  In my own visits to Iraq, I have had the opportunity to see firsthand \nthe amazing work our soldiers are doing there on the ground. We are \nproud of our military, proud of the tremendous work they are doing, and \nthank them for their efforts and their sacrifice for us each and every \nday.\n  Al-Zarqawi was a man who was responsible for the beheading, the \nkilling of hundreds and, indeed, thousands of innocent children, women, \nand men. He was responsible for the death of many Americans in uniform, \nmen and women. For those reasons, we all know it is a great day for \nIraq and, indeed, for the United States.\n  Al-Zarqawi was the operational head. He is a symbolic head, we know, \nbut equally importantly the operational head of al-Qaida in Iraq. Osama \nbin Laden called him the ``prince of Al-Qaeda.'' Reportedly, he \nmasterminded the operations, the financial infrastructure, the \nfinancial underpinnings, and the strategic support for the terrorist \nnetwork. While we all know there are many insurgents who remain in \nIraq, this is surely a major blow to the terrorists who threaten both \nthe safety and the security of Iraq and, indeed, the United States.\n  It is also a significant day in the formation of the Government of \nIraq, the appointment of the Ministers of Defense, of the Interior, and \nof National Security. It is a major step forward. The Prime Minister \nand most of the Cabinet have been in place for about 3 weeks. I think \n37 are in place with the completion of that Cabinet today. It is a \nmajor step forward. It has been a good morning. These developments are \nmajor steps forward. Although, as we all know, many challenges remain, \nI am more optimistic than ever that a free and stable Iraq can be \nachieved.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/08/senate-section/article/S5609-7", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5609-S5610]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, I certainly underscore the statement of the \ndistinguished majority leader. This is a good day for the U.S. military \nand especially our intelligence community. We should feel very good \nabout this. The mission we are talking about, the successful outcome, \nis a testament to the bravery, the skill, and the determination of \nthose dedicated men and women on the front lines. This is hard to say \nabout any human being, but he got what he deserved. Anyone who aligns \nhimself with him should know they could await a similar fate as long as \nthey engage in terror.\n  I was very pleased to hear the President's statement. It was \nmeasured. We all recognize there are a lot of difficult days ahead for \nthe United States and Iraqi forces, but having a Security Minister, a \nDefense Minister, and an Interior Minister makes it that much closer to \nwhen we can start drawing down the troops.\n\n\n                 Defense Authorization and Immigration\n\n  I look forward--I hope in the near future, and I am confident that \nwill be the case--to working on our Defense authorization bill, which \nis something we need to do.\n  I also say through the Chair to the distinguished majority leader, \nthis is important for our colleagues. We are trying to work something \nout to get the immigration reform bill to conference with the House. \nPeople think we spend a lot time on minutia, all this procedural stuff, \nbut that is the way it is. People are going to have to be patient. We \nare trying to get a vehicle to go to the House where we have assurances \nthat it will be an immigration bill and not a tax bill. We do not have \nthat worked out yet. I say to my colleagues and through the Chair to \nthe distinguished majority leader, as he knows, negotiations have \nstarted. We are trying to work it out.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, to respond through the Chair to the \nDemocratic leader--and actually our colloquy, in essence, is to our \ncolleagues--we recognize the importance, both of us, both sides of the \naisle, of getting this bill to conference. We have passed a bill that \nreflected the will of the Senate. Not everyone agreed with it. I \nthought we had a very good process we should be proud of in terms of \ndebate and amendment and allowing the people's will to be discussed and \nvoted upon.\n  The next step is getting to conference. We do not need to go into the \ntechnical aspects, but it is a challenge to get it there in a way that \ngives all of the guarantees, but with those guarantees the goal will be \nto have an immigration bill that stays on immigration. That is exactly \nwhat the Democratic leader and I are working on, and we are making \nprogress in that regard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say also that the problem is one person \ncan throw a monkey wrench into the process. We have to try to work it \nout so no wrenches are thrown.\n  Mr. President, I ask consent that Senator Stabenow from Michigan be \nrecognized for up to 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senate will resume consideration of \nH.R. 8, which the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to the consideration of H.R. 8, to make \n     the repeal of the estate tax permanent.\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there is 1 hour \nof debate equally divided between the two leaders or their designees, \nwith 10 minutes of the minority time reserved for Senator Durbin, 10 \nminutes for Senator Dorgan, and the last 20 minutes reserved as \nfollows: 10 minutes for the Democratic leader, to be followed by the \nmajority leader.\n  The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, we are now considering the repeal of the \nestate tax. The estate tax is a tax paid by 2 out of every 1,000 \nAmericans. It is not a tax that will affect the vast majority of \nAmericans because they have not accumulated enough wealth in their \nlifetime to be subject to the tax.\n  It is an action which is imposed on the very wealthiest, the very \nrichest people in America. It is a tax which is imposed on their \nestates after a certain amount is exempt. Up to $4 million is exempt \nfor a couple under current estate tax, and that number is scheduled to \nrise.\n  However, the Republican majority believes this tax is unfair. They \nbelieve it is unfair for the wealthiest people in America, who have \naccumulated millions of dollars, to pay any tax to the Government on \nthat accumulated wealth when they die. They say that is fundamentally \nunfair. They come to the Senate with a sense of outrage that we would \nask wealthy people in America to pay taxes, so they propose the \nelimination or dramatic reduction of this tax, to the point where it \nwill add substantially to the deficit of the United States of America.\n  This is not a tax cut for the wealthy; it is a tax deferral. By \nreducing or eliminating the tax on the wealthiest, they are passing the \nburden of taxation on to those in lower income groups. With their \nelimination of the death tax, they are creating a birth tax.\n  In other words, if you happen to be born in America and you are one \nof the 997 out of 1,000 who don't pay the estate tax, you will have a \nbigger debt and a bigger burden because the Republican majority \nbelieves the wealthiest should be spared paying taxes. People who have \nhad the good fortune of living and succeeding in America should be \nspared, according to the Republicans, any responsibility to pay back to \nthis great Nation for the benefits they have accrued during their \nlifetime. There is a sense of outrage on the Republican side of the \naisle that somehow we would impose this tax. They have created this \nvast mythology about the estate tax. They translated it into a death \ntax, suggesting to Americans that when you die you must pay taxes. That \nis plain false. Only 2 or 3 out of 1,000 people who die each year pay \nany such tax. Yet the average person on the street believes the \nGovernment is going to come and grab whatever small amounts they have \nkept together for their sons and daughters and take it away in tax \ncollection. It is not true. It is false. It is misleading. It is \ndeceptive.\n  Who is pushing this great effort to eliminate the estate tax? Will it \nsurprise you to know they are the fattest special interests in \nWashington, DC? An analysis has shown--and these numbers are nothing \nshort of amazing--that 18 families in the United States of America, \nwith a combined net worth of $185 billion, have spent $200 million \nlobbying on Capitol Hill to repeal this estate tax. Why? They are going \nto make a fortune because their fortunes will be\n\n[[Page S5611]]\n\nprotected from being taxed. This is the ultimate special interest bill. \nThis bill has nothing to do with the average American, the average \nAmerican family, the average American farm or the average American \nbusiness. It is about the wealthiest people in America flexing their \nmuscles, pushing through on Capitol Hill the most outrageous piece of \nspecial interest legislation in modern memory. The Republican majority \nis pushing this to the floor with a straight face: We want to eliminate \nthe death tax.\n  What does it mean for the families behind Wal-Mart, Gallo wine, \nCampbell's soup and other companies? It means that if they are given \nfull repeal of the estate tax, these 18 families will collectively net \na windfall of $71 billion. That is what this is about.\n  Who will end up paying for it? Our children will. We will take the \nmoney which we are not going to collect from the estate tax and end up \nborrowing. And who will loan us the money? More and more the Bush \nadministration goes overseas to borrow the money: Japan, China, Korea, \nthe oil sheikhs, they will loan us the money. But there are strings \nattached. Do you remember the Dubai Ports deal? Think there is a \nconnection between these Middle Eastern oil giants now buying into the \nAmerican economy and what we are doing on the estate tax? It is \ndirectly linked. There are bankers, mortgagors. They sell us oil. Why? \nBecause the Republican majority runs up the biggest deficits in the \nhistory of the United States.\n  When President Bush took office, the national debt was $5.8 trillion. \nThe accumulated debt in the history of America was $5.8 trillion. Five \nyears later, the national debt is knocking on the door of $9 trillion. \nAnd if they continue to eliminate taxes on the wealthiest people, the \ndebt will be $11 trillion. For the students who are watching this \ndebate on television, in the galleries, through C-SPAN, let me tell \nyou, this effort to find a benefit for the wealthiest families, to \nabsolve them from paying debts for the success they have experienced, \nis going to be visited on our children and grandchildren. Where is the \nfairness and where is the justice? Where is the sense of outrage that \nwe would give this special interest legislation such a priority in the \nSenate? Why wouldn't we consider changing the Tax Code so that average \nworking families can deduct the cost of college education for their \nkids? Isn't that something good for America? Isn't that of greater \nvalue than to say to the superrich: We are going to spare you from \npaying $71 billion in taxes over the life of this repeal? No. From \ntheir point of view, you don't think about the families putting the \nkids through college. You don't worry about the situation where we have \nso many Americans, 46 million in fact, without health insurance today. \nYou don't deal with the reality of funding education. You focus your \nattention and the time of the Republican majority on repealing a tax on \nthe super wealthiest people in America.\n  Warren Buffett is the second richest man in America. He said: Do you \nknow what is going on here? It is class warfare. And do you know what? \nMy class is winning.\n  They sure are.\n  Today the Republican majority will try to put a victory on the board \nfor the richest people in America. Why do we do this? For some, it is a \nmatter of philosophy. They happen to believe if the rich get richer, \nAmerica will be better off. That has been a philosophy around this \ncountry for a long time. I come from a different point of view. I think \nthe strength of America is in its families, those families getting up \nand going to work every day, doing their best to keep families \ntogether, to save money for the future, to put their kids through \ncollege. It is in small businesses that take risks and sometimes fail \nbut, when they succeed, build into a business that gives them a chance \nto hire more people. It is in family farms. That is the strength of \nAmerica. These other folks have done quite well.\n  The New York Times went to the Farm Bureau and asked them: Name for \nus a single example of a family being forced to sell its farm because \nof estate tax liability. Not one single example derived from the \nAmerican Farm Bureau. They couldn't find one. I did the same thing in \nIllinois. Not one farm has been lost because of Federal estate tax \nliability.\n  We will hear them crying and moaning and whining and rending their \ngarments about how this is needed to save family farms. They can't come \nup with a single example where a family farm has been lost by the \nestate tax. According to the Congressional Budget Office, only 123 \nfamily-owned farms and 135 family-owned small businesses would pay any \nestate tax at all with a $2 million exemption level--across America, \npay any tax at all, let alone risk losing their business or farm.\n  This has been exaggerated to a point which is shameful. To think that \nat a time when we are facing the biggest deficits, when we are involved \nin a war where we are asking our sons and daughters to risk their lives \nfor America, that we are going to make those who are comfortable more \ncomfortable by sparing them their taxes, that we are going to welcome \nhome the soldiers by saying, thanks for serving America and, \nincidentally, here is a larger national debt for you to carry the rest \nof your life.\n  I urge my colleagues to defeat this effort to repeal the estate tax.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, we are going to have an opportunity very shortly to \ndo something historic; that is, to begin consideration of a process by \nwhich we can either eliminate or substantially reduce the impact of \nthis most unfair tax of all, the estate tax, on small businesses, on \nfamily farms, on Americans of all stripes who worry that they will have \nto pay up to half of what they have put into their life savings, their \nbusiness, their farm, to the Government in an estate tax.\n  It has been found by Gallup surveys and others that the American \npeople believe this is the most unfair tax and by percentages, 60 to 70 \npercent agree that it should be eliminated. To some extent there has \nbeen an argument that I have to address because it is a straw man. That \nargument is that this is all about helping the most wealthy families. \nThat is not correct. Here is why. What we have proposed is that \nimmediately upon going to the House bill, there be a cloture vote on \nthat bill which, frankly, I think all would agree, is doubtful of \npassing. That is to say that there aren't 60 votes in this Chamber to \npermanently repeal the estate tax. That is what the Senator from \nIllinois was talking about. We all know that.\n  As a result, the majority leader has made an absolute commitment--and \nI reaffirm it--that immediately following that vote, the majority \nleader would lay down a substitute, a compromise, if you will, that \nprovides that the estate tax will be substantially modified but not \nrepealed. It will be modified in a way that will help those who, \nbecause land values have been increasing or because they put all of \ntheir money into a small business, would be either required to pay \nsubstantial amounts of money to plan for the potential of paying the \nestate tax, paying lawyers and accountants and buying insurance and the \nlike, would be responsible for a substantial estate tax bill, it would \ngive them relief from that obligation, but it would still say that the \nwealthiest families, the Warren Buffetts and others mentioned a moment \nago, would still have to pay a substantial amount of estate tax.\n  The specific proposal that will be offered provides that there will \nbe $5 million exempted and that that would be indexed to inflation and \nthat after that, the capital gains rate would be the rate that would \napply to estates that would be taxed. But when you get to the superrich \nthe Senator from Illinois referred to, those with a $30 million estate \nwho would probably qualify in that category, anything above that amount \nwould be taxed at a 30 percent rate which would bring in, obviously, a \nsubstantial amount of revenue given the wealth of some of those \nestates. We are not here debating whether it is going to be either all \nor nothing, a permanent repeal of the estate tax or the status quo. \nWhat we are talking about is going to a process by which we consider a \ncompromise which will, in fact, tax the most wealthy but will allow \nthose small businesses and farms the opportunity to continue their \nexistence.\n  It is interesting that there is a suggestion that this somehow \nwouldn't\n\n[[Page S5612]]\n\nhelp the small business or the family farm. Let's quote some actual \ndata. For example, the Senator from Illinois challenged us to show one \nfarm that had to sell property in order to pay the estate tax. Here is \none, Sam and Ann Payne in Georgia, not too far north of Atlanta. The \nfarm had been in their family since the early 1800s. When their father \ndied in 1968, they had their first experience with the death tax. But \nthen Sam's mother was still alive and it was manageable. When she died \n6 years ago, they had to pay close to $400,000 in estate tax. Their \nland had increased in value. So in order to pay that tax, they had to \nsell part of their farm to local developers, including an airport. Here \nis what Sam Payne said:\n\n       At a certain point, you sell off too much land and your \n     farm gets so small that you are not a viable agricultural \n     unit, making it difficult to turn a profit.\n\n  There are many other examples. Here is what the American Farm Bureau \nsaid in a survey. They surveyed their members and nearly 20 percent of \nthe farmers responded to a survey that said that they had to pay \nFederal estate taxes in the previous 5 years; 44 percent said they \nwould have to mortgage the farm to pay the death tax; 28 percent said \nthat all or part of the farm's business would have to be sold; 39 \npercent said that any plans for growth would have to be delayed or \ncanceled.\n  Here is a pernicious aspect of this. A lot of people spend a fortune \ntrying to avoid the tax: 77 percent of farmers reported that they had \nto spend money each year on estate planning; 40 percent said that they \npaid more than $10,000 a year; 13 percent more than $25,000 a year; 5 \npercent pay more than $100,000 a year. That is a real impact, the same \nkind of impact on small business. We can provide examples. I gave an \nexample yesterday.\n  Minority businesses are the most hard hit. Here is what Robert \nJohnson, founder of Black Entertainment TV, had to say:\n\n       Elimination of the estate tax will help close the wealth \n     gap in this nation between African-American families and \n     white families.\n\n  A 2004 study by Impacto Group LLC surveyed Hispanic family-owned \nbusiness owners; 20 percent of Hispanic family business owners said \nthey would have to sell their business or property in order to pay the \nestate tax. Only about half of the respondents believe that they are \nprepared to deal with the death taxes if the principal owner dies.\n  Surveys conducted by the Family Enterprise Center of Kennesaw State \nCollege and the Center for Family Business at Loyola University found \nthat 90 percent of black-owned, family firms say that paying estate \ntaxes makes growth of the business more difficult; 87 percent say \npaying the estate tax makes the survival of the business more \ndifficult. Nobody who has run a small business or family farm or has \naccumulated wealth, perhaps simply by the growth in the value of real \nestate, will argue that this is not a matter of concern to them.\n  As the Wall Street Journal editorialized today, even the people who \nappreciate the fact that it won't apply to them favor repeal. I will \nquote from the editorial:\n\n       Americans favor repealing the death tax not because they \n     think it will help them directly. They're more principled \n     than that. Two-thirds of the public wants to repeal it \n     because they think taxing a lifetime of thrift due to the \n     accident of death is unfair and even immoral. They also \n     understand that the really rich won't pay the tax anyway \n     because they hire lawyers to avoid it.\n\n  That is the point of the argument we heard a moment ago.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the editorial in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           Taxes Everlasting\n\n       If you've followed the death tax debate, you know that few \n     issues raise liberal blood pressure more. Liberal journalists \n     in particular are around the bend: How in the world can the \n     public support repealing a tax that most Americans will never \n     pay? Good question, so let us try to answer.\n       Americans favor repealing the death tax not because they \n     think it will help them indirectly. They're more principled \n     than that. Two-thirds of the public wants to repeal it \n     because they think taxing a lifetime of thrift due to the \n     accident of death is unfair, and even immoral. They also \n     understand that the really rich won't pay the tax anyway \n     because they hire lawyers to avoid it.\n       For proof that they're right, they need only watch the \n     current debate. The superrich or their kin--such as Bill \n     Gates Sr. and Warren Buffett--are some of the loudest voices \n     opposing repeal. Yet they are able to shelter their own vast \n     wealth by creating foundations or via other crafty estate \n     planning. Edward McCaffery, an estate tax expert at USC Law \n     School, argues that ``if breaking up large concentrations of \n     wealth is the intention of the death tax, then it is a \n     miserable failure.''\n       Do the Kennedys or Rockefellers look any poorer from the \n     existence of a tax first created in 1917? The real people who \n     pay the levy are the thrifty middle class and entrepreneurs \n     who've built up a modest nest egg or business and are hit by \n     a 46% tax rate when they die. Americans want family \n     businesses, ranches, farms and other assets to be passed from \n     one generation to the next. Yet the U.S. has one of the \n     highest death tax rates in the world.\n       By far the largest supporter of preserving the death tax is \n     the life insurance lobby, which could lose billions of \n     dollars from policies written to avoid the tax. The Los \n     Angeles Times reported this week that the insurance industry \n     is the main funder of an anti-repeal outfit known as the \n     Coalition for America's Priorities. A coalition ad features a \n     sound-alike of heiress Paris Hilton praising the Senate as \n     ``like awesome'' for cutting her family's taxes. But this is \n     the opposite of the truth. The American Family Business \n     Institute has found that the bulk of the Hilton estate has \n     long been sheltered from the IRS in tax-free trusts.\n       Frank Keating, president of the American Council of Life \n     Insurers, has criticized repeal by saying: ``I am \n     institutionally and intestinally against huge blocs of \n     inherited wealth. I don't think we need the Viscount of Enron \n     or the Duke of Microsoft.'' But while he was Oklahoma \n     Governor in the 1990s, Mr. Keating took a different line: ``I \n     believe death taxes are un-American. They are rooted in the \n     failed collectivist schemes of the past and have no place in \n     a society that values entrepreneurship, work, saving, and \n     families.'' We can appreciate how such a marked change of \n     views would give Mr. Keating intestinal issues.\n       Which brings us back to the political paradox that, even \n     with Republicans at a low ebb, voters still support death tax \n     repeal. A majority in both houses of Congress also supports \n     it, so Senate Democrats can only stop repeal with the \n     procedural dodge of a filibuster. Even at that, several \n     Democrats are clamoring for a compromise that would take the \n     issue off the table in November. They recall what happened in \n     2004 to Tom Daschle in South Dakota.\n       But Republicans should only accept a compromise if it \n     lowers the death tax rate enough (to 15%) to reduce the \n     incentive for avoidance and eliminate its punitive nature. \n     Voters have been saying clearly and for years that they don't \n     want a tax whose only justification is government greed and \n     envy.\n\n  Mr. KYL. A lot of the superrich don't care. That is true. There are \ncertain people I will not name, but they have been named, who support \ncontinuation of the tax. They have the wealth to be able to get around \nit with estate planning and to buy the insurance. You heard me quote \nfrom minority business owners and farmers who say they cannot afford to \npay the cost of that insurance and the estate planning.\n  Of all of the groups, there is only one that opposes what we are \ntrying to do, and that is the insurance industry. Why not? They make \nmoney off of it. If we are talking about special interest legislation, \nlet's understand that the special interests we are trying to protect \nhere are the family-owned businesses, the family farms, the minority \nbusinesses; and the special interests that are fighting us are the big \ninsurance companies and the estate planners that make millions of \ndollars every year.\n  Alicia Munnell, who was a member of the Clinton administration, has \nsaid that the American people pay each year about the same amount to \nplan against paying the estate tax as the Federal Government collects \nin revenues from the estate tax. So in effect it is a double tax. Sure, \nthe superwealthy don't care because they have enough money to plan \nagainst that. What we are going to do in this proposed compromise is \nmake sure that they pay, but that the people who get caught simply \nbecause of the increased value of their property or business will not \nhave to pay.\n  I also ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article \nby Harvey Rosen from the Market Watch, dated June 8, which makes the \npoint that the American people will benefit when we reduce the rates on \nthe estate tax because it enables capital formation by entrepreneurs \nand that the economy is better off as a result of the reduction of \nthese rates.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S5613]]\n\n                   [From Market Watch, June 8, 2006]\n\n                 It Is the Estate Tax Rate That Matters\n\n                          (By Harvey S. Rosen)\n\n       Princeton, NJ.--This week, the U.S. Senate is expected to \n     turn its attention to the Federal estate tax.\n       Under current law, the estate tax is being phased out, with \n     repeal set for 2010. But then in 2011 the old law is \n     scheduled to be restored, with marginal tax rates that can \n     exceed 50%. The old law was capricious, complex, and \n     inefficient--bringing it back to life in 2011 would be bad \n     policy.\n       While the first-best policy response would be to make \n     repeal permanent, this option appears to be politically \n     infeasible. An interesting alternative proposed by Senator \n     John Kyl, R-Ariz., would make the estate tax rate permanent \n     at 15%, increase the exemption level to $5 million, and \n     include step-up in basis.\n       As the debate on Senator Kyl's and other options moves \n     forward, it is important to focus on keeping the rate of the \n     tax law because of the negative consequences that a high rate \n     has on the economy.\n       First, a high estate tax rate has a detrimental effect on \n     the behavior of individuals in their roles as entrepreneurs. \n     People with large estates are disproportionately owners of \n     small businesses--Douglas Holtz-Eakin, former director of the \n     Congressional Budget Office and Donald Marples (GAO) estimate \n     that entrepreneurs are three times more likely to be subject \n     to the estate tax than portfolio investors. The estate tax in \n     effect reduces the returns to entrepreneurs' investment. \n     Thus, the estate tax increases the ``user cost of capital''--\n     the rate of return that an investment must make in order to \n     be profitable. The higher the user cost of capital, the lower \n     the number of profitable investments available to the \n     entrepreneur.\n       According to the U.S. Treasury's Office of Tax Analysis, \n     the estate tax leads to an increase in the tax rate of \n     between 4.5 to 9%. Research on entrepreneurial decision \n     making that I published with several colleagues suggests that \n     a 5 percentage point increase in marginal tax rates leads to \n     a 9.9% decline in investment by entrepreneurs. So, if we take \n     the 4.5% tax increase at the low end of the Treasury's range, \n     the implied decrease in entrepreneurial investment is 8.9%. \n     Using the 9% tax rate at the top of the Treasury's range, the \n     decrease in capital accumulation by entrepreneurs is 17.8%.\n       In short, changes in the user cost of capital induced by \n     the estate tax have a substantial impact on entrepreneurs's \n     investment spending. Given that entrepreneurial enterprises \n     are an important source of growth and innovation in our \n     economy, this is a very sobering result.\n       Second, an increase in the estate tax rate would have a \n     negative effect on individual saving rates and wealth \n     accumulation. Research by academic economists suggests that \n     an increase in the estate tax rate of 10% leads to a roughly \n     14% decrease in net worth. Other serious studies conclude \n     that there would be a substantial increase in saving if the \n     estate tax were eliminated altogether.\n       Put this together with an observation taught in every \n     introductory course in economics: a smaller capital stock \n     reduces productivity and labor income throughout the economy. \n     The clear implication is that the estate tax reduces incomes \n     for everyone. Because of its negative effect on capital \n     accumulation, the burden of the estate tax is shifted, at \n     least in part, to all workers. In particular, future \n     generations are worse off by virtue of having a smaller \n     capital stock with which to work.\n       Third, arguments that high estate tax rates make the U.S. \n     tax code more progressive are problematic. The basic \n     assumption is that the burden of the estate tax falls \n     entirely on the decedent--the rich dead guy takes the entire \n     tax hit. This assumption is natural because, by law, the \n     decedent's estate is responsible for paying the tax. However, \n     it reflects an approach that the economics profession has \n     rejected for at least a century. Who bears the burden of a \n     tax depends on the underlying economic fundamentals, not on \n     who writes the check to the IRS. When the government levied a \n     special tax on yachts, for example, the burden fell not only \n     on the owners of yachts, but also on the individuals who \n     produced and serviced them. Applying the same kind of logic \n     in this case, the most likely scenario is that the decedent \n     will not bear the burden of the tax. Rather, he or she will \n     simply leave a smaller bequest, because the estate tax makes \n     wealth accumulation (saving) less attractive.\n       Thus, the argument made by estate tax proponents that \n     increasing the exemption will enhance progressivity is \n     flawed. Whatever the size of the exemption, some \n     entrepreneurs will be hit by the tax and scale back their \n     investment. Other individuals will simply save less. In both \n     cases, the result is the same: workers are worse off. Any \n     estate tax that is big enough to collect substantial revenue \n     is also big enough to have a substantial negative effect on \n     saving and the economy.\n       In conclusion, although increasing the exemption for the \n     estate tax while retaining a high rate might appear to \n     enhance the progressivity of the tax system, this is not \n     likely correct. True, the typical worker has little reason to \n     know that her weekly paycheck is smaller because of the \n     estate tax. She may never realize that part of the burden of \n     the tax falls on her. But conventional economic analysis \n     suggests that these subtle, indirect effects are real, and \n     critical to understanding the ultimate burden of the tax. As \n     the debate on increasing the estate tax exemption moves \n     forward, policymakers should understand that the putative \n     progressivity of such a step is likely illusory and that \n     reducing the rate would benefit the economy.\n  Mr. KYL. He concludes that ``any estate tax big enough to collect \nsubstantial revenue is also big enough to have a substantial negative \neffect on saving and the economy. Reducing the rate will benefit the \neconomy.''\n  The bottom line is this: We are going to have an opportunity to vote \nyes on cloture to take up the House repeal bill. For those who believe \nin full repeal, the next vote would be to support full repeal. \nPresumably, that won't pass. The next thing that will happen--and the \nmajority leader made this crystal clear, and I reiterate this \ncommitment--is that we will have an opportunity then to vote on the \nproposal that Senator Baucus and Senator Lincoln and Senators Bill \nNelson and Ben Nelson and others of us have been working on to provide \na substantial exempted amount--$5 million per spouse--capital gains \nrate to apply to whatever has to be paid. But when an estate hits $30 \nmillion, from then on, it gets hit with a 30-percent rate. That is a \nfair way to help the people at the lower end of the spectrum and yet \ncollect the revenue from those very wealthy estates which we all agree \ncan pay part of this estate tax.\n  Mr. COBURN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KYL. Yes.\n  Mr. COBURN. A lot has been made that we are going to borrow money to \npay for this tax. But the fact is that the amount of money not \ncollected that is owed to the Federal Government is close to $400 \nbillion a year. The other side of that is there is over $200 billion a \nyear that has been proven to be wasteful or fraudulently misspent by \nthis Government, which we condone each year. That is $600 billion.\n  We would not be debating this tax if we were doing our job in terms \nof oversight. Just in terms of improper payments, is the Senator aware \nof the fact that there is over $150 billion a year paid out by the \nFederal Government to people who do not deserve it, have not earned it, \nand yet have manipulated the system to get it? I am not talking about \npoor people; I am talking about contractors. The point I want to make \nis that we would not even be having a discussion on the principles of \nthis tax because it is not needed because we are not doing our jobs in \nterms of oversight. There is $600 billion that would put us into \nsurplus by $200 billion right now, including the cost of the war, if we \nwould just do our job. I wondered if the Senator was aware of that.\n  Mr. KYL. Yes, because of the great work of the Senator from Oklahoma, \nwe have been made aware of that. He has helped to lead the effort to \ncollect this money and save the money the Government is wasting. The \nSenator knows that we support fully his efforts in that regard and \nintend to pursue it.\n  I will conclude my remarks by simply saying that we have an \nopportunity to do something very historic for an awful lot of folks in \nthis country who deserve the relief. I hope colleagues will give us the \nopportunity by supporting the cloture motion when that comes up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, this is an interesting debate, and in \nsome ways it is very troubling. I wish to talk a little about fiscal \npolicy and where we find ourselves.\n  It is almost as if this place is disconnected from what is happening. \nThe night before last, I sat in HC-5 until about 1:30 in the morning \nworking on the emergency supplemental appropriation request--roughly \n$90 billion for Iraq, Afghanistan, and a portion for Katrina. None of \nit is paid for; it is just emergency spending--$90 billion. This takes \nus to something close to $400 billion over these recent years, none of \nit paid for.\n  Not many weeks ago, we had on the floor of the Senate a proposed $70 \nbillion tax cut. That passed. It wasn't paid for. Just cutting the \nrevenues. I voted against that. So we are spending money without \ncovering it. We are cutting taxes. The gross federal debt will be $8.6 \ntrillion at the end of 2006. We will add over $600 billion to the \nindebtedness just this year alone in fiscal policy. We will add over \n$700 billion this\n\n[[Page S5614]]\n\nyear alone in trade deficits. That is different from the fiscal policy. \nCombined this year, we likely will be in debt by some $1.3 trillion. \nEverybody understands this is completely off track and dangerous.\n  So what is the business today? How about cutting some taxes again? \nWhat is going to come behind this? A third tax cut bill coming from the \nFinance Committee. It is unbelievable. It is almost as if somebody \npulled the plug out of the socket, so there is no current coming \nthrough here by which people can think straight. You can go to the \nhometown cafe or restaurant and folks ask: What do you do next? You are \nchoking on debt up to your neck--$8.6 trillion of fiscal policy debt \nthis year. It is going to increase to almost $12 trillion in the next \nfive years, we expect. So what do we do next? We say we ought to get \nrid of the ``death tax.''\n  But there is no death tax, of course. This is a function of a clever \npollster, paid handsomely by people with a lot of money to come up with \na moniker that would allow them politically to cast this into the water \nand have it float. My colleague spoke at great length about the ``death \ntax.'' Clever, interesting, but it doesn't exist.\n  There is, in fact, a tax on inherited wealth in this country. Very \nfew Americans pay it. Currently, the exemption is $2 million for a \nhusband and $2 million for a wife. If you don't have $4 million in net \nassets in your family, don't worry about this issue. That is going to \n$3.5 million apiece, so that is $7 million. If you are not above $7 \nmillion, don't worry about it.\n  By the way, notwithstanding those exemptions, if one spouse dies, the \nother owns everything--a 100-percent exemption--and there is no estate \ntax. It doesn't matter what the estate is worth; the other spouse owns \nit. There is a 100-percent spousal exemption.\n  This ruse of suggesting that this is a death tax is an unbelievable. \nThe most interesting hoax of all is this small business and family farm \nissue. I will tell you why it is a hoax. I came to the floor of the \nSenate twice and offered amendments twice. The last time I offered the \namendment, it would have completely repealed the estate tax obligation \nof any small business and any family farm passed from the parents to \nthe children, the lineal descendants who continued to operate it. If \nthat family business or farm, no matter the size, were passed from the \nparents to the children, on January 1, 2003, it would have forever been \nexempt from an estate tax. My amendment would have taken that issue off \nthe table. And 54 Members of the Senate voted against that, including \nthe people here today crying crocodile tears over small business and \nfamily farm issues. When they had the chance to do this, they didn't \nwant to. Why? That is not the purpose.\n  The purpose of this issue is to say to the wealthiest Americans that \nwe want to help you. My colleague said we are going to craft something \nthat is a little bit of a modification. He didn't tell you that the \nmodification would lose some 80 percent of the money. But his real \ninterest and the interest of most of the folks who are speaking is to \nrepeal the death tax, which doesn't exist.\n  Now, we are at war, up to our neck in debt--$8.6 trillion in debt, \nheading toward $12 trillion in debt--with a budget policy that is \ncompletely out of control and a trade policy that is wildly out of \ncontrol. What do those who have the majority in this Chamber decide \nthey ought to do? The President, the majority in this Chamber and in \nthe House--what is their next step? It is to cut taxes for the \nwealthiest Americans.\n  Let me tell you what Warren Buffett says about this. He is an \ninteresting guy. He is the second richest man in the world but a really \npublic-spirited man. He said, ``If this is class warfare, my side is \nwinning.'' He doesn't approve of this; he thinks this is nuts. He has \nan estimated worth of $42 billion. He said:\n\n       I personally think that society is responsible for a very \n     significant percentage of what I have earned. If you stick me \n     down in the middle of Bangladesh, or Peru, or someplace, you \n     will find out how much this talent is going to produce in the \n     wrong kind of soil.\n\n  Being here is what allowed him to be successful, he said. He said, by \nimplication, that we owe something back.\n  We are at war, and my colleagues have decided that the pressing \npriority is to remove the tax burden from the wealthiest people in this \ncountry, the ones worth billions of dollars. Franklin Delano Roosevelt \nsaid in one of his fireside chats--this in another age when we were at \nwar:\n\n       Not all of us can have the privilege of fighting our \n     enemies in distant parts of the world. Not all of us can have \n     the privilege of working in a munitions factory or a \n     shipyard, or on the farms or in the oil fields or mines, \n     producing the weapons or raw materials that are needed by our \n     Armed Forces. But there is one front and one battle where \n     everyone in the United States--every man, woman, and child--\n     is in action. . . . That front is right here at home, in our \n     daily lives, and in our daily tasks. Here at home everyone \n     will have the privilege of making whatever self-denial is \n     necessary, not only to supply our fighting men, but to keep \n     the economic structure of our country fortified and secure. . \n     . .\n\n  Do you see any urge at all by the majority here, by the White House, \nto call this country to action for some public spiritedness, about what \nwe need to do together? We have soldiers dying on the battlefield, and \nwe are sitting downstairs in the Capitol Building until about 1:30 in \nthe morning appropriating money for those soldiers for their munitions, \nfor their trucks and tanks and battleships, and we will not pay for it. \nThe majority party says we will not pay for it. Even as we spend money, \nwe won't pay for it. But we see that their highest priority is to cut \ntaxes for those who are very well off.\n  The wealthiest 1 percent of Americans now own a bigger piece of the \npie than the poorest 90 percent added together. That gap is growing. \nThis legislation will once again decide to expand the inequality of \nincome in this country.\n  Let me say this again. Those who come to this floor talking about \nsmall businesses and family farms had a chance to vote for the repeal \nof any estate tax obligation for any transfer of any family-owned \nbusiness or any family-owned farm, and that full repeal would have been \neffective on January 1, 2003; and 54 Members of the Senate voted no. I \ndaresay almost everybody speaking today in support of this legislation \nbecause they believe it will help family farms and small businesses, \nwhen they had the chance to do it, they voted against it.\n  And that tells you a little something about what is really at stake.\n  Has anybody here ever seen a hearse pull a U-Haul? Don't think so. \nYou can't take it with you. We are on this Earth for a relatively short \nperiod of time. We are blessed to live here, a unique spot on this \nplanet. And this, in my judgment, requires of us some responsibilities.\n  Oh, I know some don't want to lose anything. They want to take it all \nwith them. But you can't take it all with you. The question is: Should \nat least some of the largesse that those who have been most successful \nin this country have accumulated in this lifetime bear a tax because \nmost represent an accumulation of assets that never ever bore a tax? \nGrowth appreciation of stocks that has never been taxed, should that \nnot also contribute to this country's defense and well-being? The \nanswer is yes.\n  I hope we decide to do the right thing and reject this proposal.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I rise to oppose this bill. With an \n$8.4 trillion national debt, a budget deficit that will exceed $300 \nbillion this year, a looming entitlement crisis, and a mounting \nalternative minimum tax problem, full repeal of the estate tax at this \ntime is simply not responsible.\n  We have until 2010 to make decisions about the estate tax. In doing \nso, time will afford us the opportunity to make more informed choices, \nwith a more complete picture of our Nation's fiscal health.\n  We are talking about eliminating nearly $1 trillion in Federal \nrevenues here, during a time of war.\n  Now is not the time to place the interests of a small number of \nmillionaires ahead of millions of working families.\n  The estate tax is already being gradually phased down under current \nlaw. By 2009, only estates valued at more than $7 million per couple--\n$3.5 million per individual--will owe any estate tax at all. This means \nthat only 3 of every 1,000 people who die would have an estate large \nenough to owe any Federal estate taxes.\n  Permanently eliminating the estate tax would cost $402 billion over \nthe\n\n[[Page S5615]]\n\nnext 10 years, 2007 to 2016, though it is important to note that this \nfigure only captures the cost of 5 years of full repeal, from 2011 to \n2016.\n  When all costs are included, nearly a trillion dollars will be lost \nin the first decade following repeal, from 2012 to 2021. Included in \nthis staggering figure is $213 billion in increased interest payments \non the national debt.\n  Federal revenues are already insufficient to fund our Nation's most \ncritical domestic priorities.\n  I wish things were different, allowing a vote in support of reforming \nthe estate tax to be cast today in good conscience.\n  Let me be clear. I am no fan of the estate tax. I understand how hard \nfamilies work to provide opportunities and a better future for their \nchildren. Transferring assets from generation to generation motivates \nfamilies to work even harder. It is unfair to place unreasonable \nburdens on small businesses and families seeking to provide for future \ngenerations.\n  I am deeply concerned about California's families who own farms and \nsmall businesses. Like many of my colleagues, I worry that they may be \nforced to sell a primary residence just to pay the estate tax. Our laws \nshould not create even more hardship at a time when someone has lost a \nloved one.\n  Yet, as we consider estate tax repeal today, our Nation's fiscal \noutlook and the potential impact of this administration's policies are \nuncertain. This President has broken with his predecessors by \nsubmitting only 5-year budgets.\n  Why, you might ask? Especially after we were presented with the \ntraditional 10-year numbers during this President's first year in \noffice. The answer is that these tax cuts explode the debt and deficit \nin the outyears--the end of the 10-year window.\n  The President's tax cuts have already cost more than $1 trillion, and \nthose enacted will be more than $3 trillion over the next decade.\n  Republicans just passed another round, with the lion's share once \nagain going to the very wealthy--$50 billion to extend capital gains \nand dividends tax breaks over 10 years.\n  The Federal budget deficit will be at least $300 billion this year. \nThe national debt is soaring. And we are at war. Never before have such \nexpansive tax cuts been enacted or continued during a time of war.\n  Over the next 10 years, the debt is projected to reach nearly $12 \ntrillion. In this year alone, our national debt is slated to increase \nby $654 billion. More startling is the fact that the national debt is \ncurrently more than 66 percent of our gross domestic product, GDP. The \ntotal debt equates to roughly $30,000 owed by every American citizen.\n  When you combine the cost of the tax cuts with spending for the war \nin Iraq--currently totaling $370 billion--the inevitable result is that \nthe domestic programs that matter most are squeezed.\n  For example, the President's fiscal year 2007 budget makes \nsignificant cuts to programs such as food stamps, cut by $272 million; \nfood assistance for seniors and children, cut by $111 million; COPS, \nwhich put over 118,000 police on the streets nationwide, is being cut \nby more than $407 million, or 15,000 officers nationwide; first \nresponders--within Department of Homeland Security--by $573 million or \n25 percent; firefighters--firefighter grant program, within Department \nof Homeland Security--by $355 million; Job Corps--an education and job \ntraining program for youth--by $55 million, resulting in 1,000 fewer \nat-risk youth being served; mass transit, by $100 million; safe and \ndrug-free schools State grants, by $346 million; and education--the \nPresident's signature education program, No Child Left Behind, would be \nunderfunded this year by more than $15 billion and $55.7 billion since \nit was enacted.\n  Let me explain. Most of the money the Federal Government outlays in a \ngiven year is currently not controllable. It is spent on what are \ncalled entitlements--Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, veterans \nbenefits. If you are entitled to these benefits, you get them.\n  And if you add interest on the debt--nearly $400 billion in 2006--\nthat is about 60 percent of everything spent in a given year. So that \nleaves 40 percent, half of which is the defense budget and half is \neverything else.\n  There is a war going on, so it is very difficult to cut defense \nspending.\n  So while a select few are benefiting from massive tax breaks, budget \ncuts must be made--to the programs many Americans rely upon--to prevent \nuncontainable deficits.\n  There is a fundamental shift taking place. Republicans have become \nthe profligate spenders, while Democrats have become the deficit hawks.\n  Americans deserve more responsible leadership. Leadership is about \nplanning for the future and making the difficult decisions that ensure \neconomic stability for our children and their grandchildren.\n  With the threatening fiscal demands of baby boomers retiring and the \npending insolvency of Medicare in less than two decades, repealing the \nestate tax today would be inconceivably shortsighted.\n  I urge my colleagues to employ sensible leadership and understand the \nresponsibilities we have to uphold. We have a responsibility to working \nfamilies, veterans, senior citizens, children, and low-income \ncommunities.\n  No one will deny that this issue needs to be revisited in the coming \nyears. We must adopt a balanced estate tax compromise, while holding \nthe line on spending in order to restore a program of fiscal sanity. I \nlook forward to working with my colleagues to protect small businesses \nand family farms, without unreasonably jeopardizing our Nation's \nfinancial well-being and our ability to help those who need Congress \nmost.\n  In the meantime, I urge my colleagues to do what they know is right: \nencourage a more responsible fiscal course and stand in opposition to \nfull repeal of the estate tax at this time. This is the wrong policy at \nthe wrong time.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, nothing could place more stress on a \nfamily than the loss of a loved one. Yet at such a difficult time, too \nmany families in America today must make decisions about selling a \nbusiness or a farm that has been in the family for generations in order \nto pay estate taxes, or, as they are more commonly called, death taxes.\n  That is wrong. That is why I support the repeal of the death tax--\nimmediately, completely, and permanently. No American family should be \nforced to visit the undertaker and the tax collector on the same day.\n  We have made important progress towards eliminating this onerous tax \nunder President Bush's leadership. In 2001, Congress began phasing out \nthe death tax, and will phase it out completely in 2010. Yet because of \nour budget rules, the death tax will return in full force in 2011.\n  Starting in 2011, many small-business owners and their families may \nbe unfairly penalized if we do not eliminate the death tax. We can \nchange that by repealing one of the most destructive, unfair taxes ever \nconceived by government. Let's kill the death tax forever.\n  We ought to kill it especially on behalf of America's small \nbusinesses, the lifeblood of our growing economy. From their successes \ncome the new jobs of today and the economic growth of tomorrow. Yet the \ndeath tax often hits small businesses the hardest.\n  Today, we see a dogged minority working again to keep death and taxes \nnot just inevitable, but inseparable. But death and taxes are a \ndestructive tag team for our economy, because the death tax destroys \nsmall businesses.\n  My colleague the Democratic leader said recently that during a trip \nhome to his native Nevada, not a single one of his constituents spoke \nto him about the repeal of the death tax. I think he took this as some \nkind of proof that we should not address this issue.\n  Well, I want to bring to my colleagues' attention a Kentuckian who \ndid approach me about this issue last week, when I was at the Perry \nCounty Civic Night at Hazard Community College in Hazard, KY, on May \n31.\n  I spoke with a constituent named Bill Fields. He is the co-owner of \nPerry Distributors Inc., a beer distributor. Without permanent relief \nfrom the death tax, he is unable to plan for the future of his business \nand his family.\n  Bill is the third generation of his family to be active in the \nbusiness, and his parents are still active in it as well. Right now, \nthe Fields family has to pay between $15,000 and $25,000 a year\n\n[[Page S5616]]\n\nfor an insurance policy, just in the event that Bill's parents pass on \nand the family is hit with this massive death tax.\n  And even at such a high cost, that policy will not cover the full tax \nburden. Bill estimates it will only cover about 20 percent. He would \nhave to borrow to pay the rest.\n  Bill says: ``The way things are now, nobody knows what to do with \nestate planning.'' It's a shame, but it is true.\n  Now, Bill is still a young man--he is 43--with plenty of working \nyears left in him. But one day, he will want to pass on his business to \nhis heirs.\n  Unless we act, after Bill passes away, his family may have to sell \nthe business he worked so hard to build during his lifetime just to pay \nthese burdensome taxes. Bill's family faces the same dilemma as too \nmany other Kentucky families who own small businesses.\n  Before I conclude my remarks, I want to bring to my colleagues' \nattention an excellent column in this Monday's Washington Post by the \nSenator from Alabama, Jeff Sessions, titled ``. . . Or Unfair Burden on \nFamilies?''\n  The Senator from Alabama rightly says, ``The death tax is almost \ndead. Let's put the stake in its heart.''\n  I commend my colleague Senator Sessions for writing so cogently and \npersuasively on the pernicious effects of the death tax. I ask that his \ncolumn be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, June 5, 2006]\n\n                ``. . . or Unfair Burden on Families?''\n\n                           (By Jeff Sessions)\n\n       This week the Senate is expected to vote on permanent \n     repeal of the estate tax. With this vote, Congress will have \n     an opportunity to finish the job it started five years ago.\n       The estate tax--or, as many of us prefer to call it, the \n     death tax--is a tax imposed on the transfer of assets or \n     property from a deceased person to his or her heirs. This is \n     one of the IRS's most painful taxes, as it hits families at \n     the worst possible time, when they are dealing with the death \n     of a loved one.\n       Congress passed a gradual phaseout of this tax at the \n     urging of President Bush in 2001, and it was scheduled to \n     disappear in 2010. But because of the peculiarities of the \n     lawmaking process, the death tax will return in 2011--at the \n     same high rates that existed before--unless Congress enacts \n     new legislation. In April 2005 the House passed a permanent \n     repeal of the death tax by a vote of 272 to 162. Over a year \n     has passed since; it is time for the Senate to act:\n       The list of reasons for eliminating the death tax is long. \n     To begin with, this tax punishes thrift and saving. It tells \n     people that it's better to spend freely during their \n     lifetimes than to leave assets for their children and \n     grandchildren, which will be taxed heavily by the federal \n     government.\n       The death tax hits hardest at heirs of small-business \n     owners and family farmers. In many cases, the heirs cannot \n     afford to pay the tax and are forced to downsize, layoff \n     employees or even sell their business or farm.\n       There can be no doubt that closely held family businesses \n     that are growing and beginning to compete with the big guys \n     are often devastated by the tax. I believe the death tax is a \n     major factor in business consolidation and loss of \n     competition.\n       This tax hurts the growth of minority-owned businesses. As \n     the first generation of African American millionaires begins \n     to die, many of the companies they founded will have to be \n     sold to pay the estate taxes. For example, the tax almost \n     forced the oldest African American-owned newspaper--the \n     Chicago Daily Defender--out of business.\n       According to Heritage Foundation economists, the death tax \n     also costs the American economy 170,000 to 250,000 potential \n     jobs each year. These jobs are never created because the \n     investments that would have financed them are not made, as \n     these resources are diverted to pay for complex trusts and \n     insurance policies to avoid the tax.\n       The death tax is double taxation. Most of the assets taxed \n     at death have already been taxed throughout an individual's \n     lifetime.\n       The death tax accounts for a small portion of federal \n     government revenue, an expected $28 billion in 2006, or only \n     1.2 percent of federal receipts.\n       Many argue that repealing the death tax would decrease \n     charitable giving, as this tax allows individuals to deduct \n     gifts to charitable organizations. Yet, even though the \n     phasing out of the death tax began in 2001, charitable \n     contributions in the United States reached a record high in \n     2004.\n       The death tax even has a negative effect on the \n     environment, as heirs are often forced to develop \n     environmentally sensitive land to pay the tax. According to a \n     study by researchers from Mississippi State University and \n     the U.S. Forest Service, about 2.5 million acres of forest \n     land were harvested and 1.3 million acres were sold each year \n     from 1987 through 1997 to pay the estate tax.\n       Finally, the American people already understand the \n     unfairness of the death tax and support its repeal. Sixty-\n     eight percent of those surveyed in a recent poll commissioned \n     by the Tax Foundation supported repeal of the estate tax. \n     Moreover, the death tax was rated by Americans in the same \n     survey as the least fair tax.\n       As a vote approaches, it is essential that constituents let \n     their representatives hear now how unfair they believe this \n     tax is. The death tax is almost dead. Let's put the stake in \n     its heart.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to voice my \nsupport for H.R. 8, the Death Tax Repeal Permanency Act. Since coming \nto the Senate, I have continuously supported the repeal of this \nburdensome and unfair tax and am also a proud cosponsor of S. 420, the \nDeath Tax Repeal Permanency Act and S. 988, the Jobs Protection and \nEstate Tax Reform Act.\n  I believe the death tax is fundamentally unfair because it \nconstitutes another layer of taxation. After years of paying State and \nFederal income taxes and other taxes on property while trying to grow a \nbusiness, the family must pay again at the time of death. This double \ntaxation is unfair and should be eliminated.\n  Many small, family-owned businesses throughout my State of Wyoming \ncannot afford to pay the tax and are forced to close their doors. In \naddition, many landowners are forced to sell their property in order to \nafford paying this unfair tax and avoid passing on the costs to the \nnext generation. Our country should encourage growth and investment, \nnot force people to sell their assets. Families should not have to \nchoose between paying taxes or operating their business just because a \nfamily member passed away. In Wyoming, we work hard, in pursuit of the \nAmerican Dream, to create a better life for our children and \ngrandchildren. Yet the death tax punishes this dream and the families \nwho must pick up the pieces after losing a loved one.\n  The death tax not only hurts the families who are forced to pay the \ntax, it also hurts our overall economy. A Heritage Foundation study \nreports that repeal of this tax would create 482 jobs in Wyoming alone. \nWhile this number may not seem large to my colleagues from New York and \nCalifornia, 482 jobs would have a substantial economic impact for \ncommunities throughout my State. I believe we will see additional \nfinancial gains when businesses can continue their operations where \npreviously they would have had to shut their doors.\n  The death tax forces families to spend thousands of dollars on estate \nplanning. By forcing individuals and families to use vital financial \nresources on estate planning, money is being taken away from the family \nbusiness or the family farm. When we eliminate this tax, jobs will be \nsaved and money will be devoted to economic growth rather than \nextensive estate planning costs.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the passage of H.R. 8, which offers \nrelief to America's hard-working families. Eliminating the death tax \nwill bring fairness to our Tax Code as well as encourage continued \ngrowth in our economy.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Madam President, I rise to speak in opposition to the \ncomplete repeal of the estate tax.\n  First of all, let call this trillion-dollar giveaway what it is--the \nParis Hilton tax break. It is about giving billions of dollars to \nbillionaire heirs and heiresses at a time when American taxpayers just \ncan't afford it.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle have brought out the \nParis Hilton tax break in June because they are eager to make it an \nelection issue in November.\n  And I think that is fine. In fact, I am eager for the American people \nto choose. Because if people want their Government to spend $1 \ntrillion--an amount more than double what we have spent on Iraq, \nAfghanistan, and the war on terror combined--on tax breaks for \nmultimillionaires and multibillionaires, then the Republican Party is \ntheir party.\n  If the American people want to borrow billions more from foreign \ncountries, spend billions more in taxes to pay the interest on our \nnational debt, and watch billions cut from health care and education \nand gulf coast reconstruction, then the Paris Hilton tax break is your \ntax break.\n  Now let's be honest. This is not about saving small businesses and \nfamily\n\n[[Page S5617]]\n\nfarms. We can reform the estate tax to protect the few farms that are \naffected. We can set it at a level where no small business is ever \naffected. We can even repeal the estate tax altogether for the 99.5 \npercent of families with less than $7 million in taxable assets--that \nmeans families with assets almost 100 times greater than the average \nAmerican household net worth.\n  Democrats have offered to reform the estate tax in these ways time \nand time again. Reform is possible in a way that doesn cost $1 \ntrillion.\n  But our offers have always been refused, which can only mean that the \nparty in power is really interested in an unprecedented giveaway to the \nwealthiest of the wealthy.\n  And don't think for a minute that there is any plan to pay for this. \nEvery proposal to enforce pay-as-you-go rules for fiscal responsibility \nhas been rebuffed. This tax cut will have to be paid for in the years \nahead by higher taxes on working families and reduced public services \nin all of our communities. This tax cut will have to be paid for by \nhigher interest rates on homes and student loans. This tax cut will \nhave to be paid for by greater dependence on foreign countries. Alan \nGreenspan warned us against financing tax cuts with debt. But that is \nexactly what this bill does.\n  So I would ask the American people one question. At a time like \nthis--a time where America finds itself deeply in debt, struggling to \npay for a war in Iraq, a war in Afghanistan, security for our homeland, \narmor for our troops, health care for our workers, and education for \nour children--at a time of all this need, can you imagine opening \nForbes magazine, looking at its list of the 400 wealthiest Americans, \nand realizing that our Government gave the people on that list far more \nthan half a trillion dollars worth of tax breaks?\n  I know I can imagine that. And I would bet that most Americans can \nimagine that either.\n  This is shameful. Are we really going to cut taxes again for the \nForbes 400 before we fix the alternative minimum tax which affects \nmiddle-class families? Are we really going to cut taxes again for \nmultimillionaires and billionaires before we extend the expiring child \ntax credit which helps working families? Are we really going to worsen \nour country's financial future for all Americans just so that a tiny \nnumber of the estates--estates that average over $13 million--can \nescape all taxes?\n  There is no economic justification for repealing the estate tax and \ncertainly no moral justification. This is politics pure and simple.\n  So if the Republicans want to bring up their Paris Hilton tax break \nto use it as an election issue later, I say go for it. Because I can \nthink of no better statement about where and how we differ in \npriorities than that.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I am dumbfounded that the Senate is \ndebating yet another gigantic tax break for the wealthiest people in \nour society. The Republicans are pushing this latest giveaway despite \nthe fact that we are facing a deficit, this year, in excess of $300 \nbillion a year, despite the fact that they have run up $2 trillion in \nnew debt since President Bush took office, despite the fact that they \nhave increased spending by 25 percent in just 5 years' time, and \ndespite the fact that we are spending $10 billion a month on seemingly \nendless wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  The level of irresponsibility is just breathtaking. This is a tax \nbreak we cannot afford, benefitting people who don't need it. \nCurrently, the estate tax impacts far less than 1 percent of the \nwealthiest families in America. And you can be sure that these are not \nfamilies facing economic hardship or struggling to make ends meet.\n  Repeal of the estate tax would not create a single new job. It would \ndo nothing to increase productivity or competitiveness. It would do \nnothing to improve the education of our children or the general well-\nbeing of the American people. No, this is a pure and simple giveaway--a \nbonanza for those who have already received the lion's share of the tax \nbreaks passed over the last 5 years.\n  And let's be clear: There is nothing conservative about handing out \ntax breaks costing nearly $1 trillion, including interest, over 10 \nyears and passing the bill to our children and grandchildren.\n  In his State of the Union speech 3 years ago, President Bush made \nthis statement: ``We will not deny, we will not ignore, we will not \npass along our problems to other Congresses, to other presidents, and \nother generations.'' But that is exactly what repeal of the estate tax \nwould do. It would add hundreds of billions of dollars to the already-\nmassive debt that President Bush is passing on to ``other \ngenerations.'' This is not only irresponsible and reckless; it is just \nplain shameful.\n  Average family farmers are being told that they need repeal of the \nestate tax to save them from a large burden, perhaps losing their farm \nto pay the tax. But this is pure propaganda. It is simply not true.\n  The Congressional Budget Office analysis of estate tax returns from \nthe year 2000 showed a very different picture. It showed that if we \nprovide a $2 million exemption, $4 million for a married couple, which \nis the law for this year, only 123 farm-dominated estates would have \nhad to pay any estate tax. That is a mere 123 farm-dominated estates in \nthe entire United States. The details of the study note that, of those \nfarm-dominated estates, only 15--15 in the entire United States--would \nnot have sufficient liquidity to pay the tax. Only those 15 might have \nto sell land--though I doubt it. Large farm operations have a range of \nfinancial options to fall back on. Moreover, as a Washington Post \neditorial pointed out yesterday, family farm and business estate \n``heirs can spread estate tax payments over 14 years, so even those \nwithout liquid assets have plenty of time to take over the farm or \nfirm, manage it productively, and thus generate the cash to pay the \ntax.''\n  Neal Harl, one of the Nation's most respected lawyers and \nagricultural economists, knows of no instance where a farm has had to \nbe sold because of the estate tax. Iowa Farm groups supporting estate \ntax repeal have not been able to identify even one instance, so far as \nI am aware.\n  There are, indeed, some family-business-dominated estates that would \nhave to pay some estate tax. According to the Congressional Budget \nOffice, at the current level of exemption, there are 135 estates. Only \n135 estates in the entire Nation. So why is the Senate wasting precious \nlegislative days addressing an issue affecting only 135 estates?\n  There is little question that the great majority of Senators--\nincluding myself and many other Democrats--would be in favor of passing \na reasonable compromise, for example a permanent exemption of at least \na $2 million for an individual, $4 million for a couple that is the \ncurrent exemption.\n  Of course, I don't want to minimize or dismiss those few instances \nwhere real farmers and small business people might have difficulty \npaying the tax. I do believe that it should be possible to pass family \nfarms and family businesses from one generation to the next. Bear in \nmind, however, that we have had substantial estate taxes for a long \ntime. And, the reality is that many of those who face the current tax \nhad parents who passed on those same businesses with higher rates than \nthey face today.\n  There is little question that the great majority of Senators--\nincluding myself and many other Democrats--would be in favor of passing \na reasonable compromise, for example a permanent exemption of at least \na $2 million for an individual, $4 million for a couple. But I \nchallenge my Republican colleagues to tell us how they intend to make \nup for the revenue that would be lost if a full repeal of the estate \ntax is passed. The difference between a $2 million exemption and full \nrepeal is about a half trillion in the decade after 2011. How do the \nRepublicans propose to offset that lost revenue? What do they propose \nto cut? Social Security? Medicare? Education? National defense? What \nother taxes would they increase? Or do they intend to simply pass on \nanother half trillion in debt to our children and grandchildren?\n\n  Based on the record of the last 5 years, the most likely option is \nthat the debt would simply be passed on to future generations. Since \nPresident Bush took office, we have already piled up nearly $2 trillion \nin new debt.\n  It is hard to believe, but just 6 years ago, before President Bush \ntook office, we were running huge budget surpluses. We faced the very \nreal prospect\n\n[[Page S5618]]\n\nof completely eliminating the national debt within the decade. But \nthose bright prospects have been squandered in reckless tax cuts and \nout-of-control spending. We are now running record deficits. The debt \ntax will rise from about $600 for every man, woman, and child in \nAmerica in recent years to more than $1,000 per person in 2010 \naccording to the President's most recent budget submission.\n  How in the world can any responsible person who cares about the \nfiscal health of our Nation allow this to happen? How can anyone who \nbelieves in maintaining a ladder of economic opportunity for future \ngenerations--how can we instead saddle those future generations with a \ndebt burden of this magnitude?\n  As President Kennedy said, ``to govern is to choose.'' If you vote to \nsupport this estate tax repeal, who exactly are you choosing to help? \nWell, according to Congress Watch, and United for a Fair Economy, just \n18 families are in the forefront of those demanding this repeal. Those \n18 families, with over $180 billion in accumulated wealth, stand to \ngain more than $70 billion in reduced taxes in the coming years if the \nestate tax is repealed. They have been spending huge sums for lobbyists \nand media campaigns. And if they succeed in avoiding paying $70 billion \nin taxes, then who will get stuck with the bill?\n  Of those 18 families, the biggest single beneficiary of full repeal \nwould be the Walton family, which owns a lion's share of Wal-Mart. That \none family may save as much as $30 billion.\n  I reject that choice. I reject giving away another half trillion \ndollars in tax breaks to those who have already been showered with \nfabulous wealth and good fortune. If we are going to pass new tax \nbreaks, let's focus on working Americans who actually need them, \nbeginning with working parents struggling to raise their children and \npay college tuition.\n  Last month, I met with Warren Buffet, a multibillionaire and a very \nsavvy judge of the economy and business. He said that he is working to \nshift some of his investments away from the dollar. He believes that \nthe estate tax is good public policy, and he believes that a Nation \nthat recklessly cuts taxes while racking up huge budget and trade \ndeficits is heading for big, big trouble.\n  We need to come to our senses. Let's freeze the tax where it is, or \nlet's consider a somewhat higher exemption, perhaps $4 million per \ncouple. But let's reject the notion that huge estates should be passed \non at a tax rate lower than what hard-working people pay on their \nearned income.\n  In any case, it is unacceptable that we on the minority side of the \naisle are being denied an opportunity to propose reasonable compromise \nalternatives. We should not move to consider this bill until we have an \nagreement that Senators can have an open debate, with amendments \noffered and voted on by each side. And if we cannot receive such a \nguarantee, we should vote to reject cloture.\n  Madam President, this bill to repeal the estate tax would give away a \nhalf trillion dollars, as compared to the law for this year. It would \ngive away money we don't have, overwhelmingly to people who don't need \nit, and it would pass the resulting debt to people who haven't even \nbeen born yet. This bill, in its current form, is reckless and \nirresponsible. I urge my colleagues to vote against cloture. This bill \ncertainly shouldn't go forward until we have a fair, balanced proposal \nallowing amendments to the bill.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I wish to express my support for a \nfull and permanent repeal of the death tax. This is an issue of tax \nfairness. The death tax can consume up to half of the deceased owner's \nestate. Many assets that are subject to the death tax were already \ntaxed during the life of the deceased through income taxes, property \ntaxes and other levies. Imposing another tax on someone's estate at the \ntime of his or her death is a grossly unfair form of double taxation.\n  In 2001, Congress passed a phase-out of the estate tax with full \nrepeal effective in 2010. If Congress does not act soon, the law will \nrevert back to where it was prior to 2001, placing an enormous tax \nburden on family-owned farms and small businesses. Some families would \nbe forced to sell the farm or business they have just inherited to pay \nthe enormous death tax bill. This goes completely against the American \ndream of working hard, growing a business and some wealth, and leaving \nthe fruits of your labor to your children.\n  Some argue that death tax repeal only would benefit the very wealthy. \nDuring this debate we have heard names like Bill Gates and Donald \nTrump. However, the death tax has a major impact on a lot of Americans \nwho aren't household names. For example, I want to talk about Clint \nCallicott from Williamson County, TN. Clint's family farmed on land in \nWilliamson County that his father owned and then Clint inherited. The \nfarm's value began to increase due to economic growth and development \nin the county, so at the time his father passed away the land was worth \nover $1 million. Clint was forced to sell the family farm against his \nwishes in order to pay the large death tax, and the Callicott family \nhad to relocate to another county.\n  This unfortunate story illustrates the negative effect the death tax \ncan have on family farms and small businesses, and this example is only \none of many. In Alcoa, TN, Dick Daugherty and his wife tried to plan \nfor the impact of the death tax in the early 1990's by hiring a very \nexpensive estate lawyer. Their hope was to preserve their family farm \nfor their children, and they went so far as to take out an insurance \npolicy with significant premiums to ensure there would be enough cash \nwhen the time came to pay the death tax bill. However, today the value \nof the farm land has increased so much due to development in the Alcoa \narea that--despite their best efforts to plan ahead--it now looks \nunlikely that the Daugherty sons will be able to afford to hold on to \nthe land that has been in their family since 1871.\n  Clearly, there is something wrong with a tax system that forces \npeople off the land that has been in their family for generations. And \nit is just as wrong when the tax system makes it harder for family-\nowned small businesses to succeed. According to one study, less than 30 \npercent of these small businesses survive to a second generation and \nonly about 13 percent continue to a third generation. These small \nbusinesses face enough hurdles as it is without Uncle Sam imposing yet \nanother obstacle in the form of the death tax.\n  Supporters of keeping the death tax claim that repeal would be too \ncostly for the Treasury. However, over the last 10 years the death tax \nonly has accounted for about 1.3 percent of all Federal tax revenue. In \naddition, the ``costs'' of repeal have been overstated because \nestimates fail to account for estate planning and compliance costs, the \ntax revenue lost when a farm or business ceases operation due to the \ndeath tax burden, or the economic growth and job creation that would be \ngenerated by freeing up capital for investment.\n  I mentioned the burden of estate planning and compliance costs, and \nwanted to share another example from my home State of Tennessee. The \nAnderson Family operates a crop and beef cattle farm. Mr. Anderson \nrecognized the need for estate planning and formed a family partnership \nthat allowed him to pass on his farm assets to his children during his \nlifetime. This plan is likely to minimize the impact of the death tax, \nand will increase the chances that the Anderson children will be able \nto hold onto the family business. However, the considerable legal and \naccounting costs involved in forming this partnership could have been \nbetter utilized elsewhere in the family business.\n  It is staggering to note that as much as $847 billion over the last \nseveral decades has been diverted from the economy for estate planning \nand compliance costs, according to a Joint Economic Committee study. \nEstate planning can cost individual families as much as $150,000. This \nmoney could be put to better use if it were invested in creating jobs \ngrowing our economy. According to the Heritage Foundation, it's \nestimated that the Federal death tax alone is responsible for the loss \nof between 170,000 and 250,000 potential jobs each year.\n  We want a tax system that encourages growth and prosperity, not one \nthat acts as a job killer. However, anticipation of the death tax's \nimpact on one's heirs causes many people to stop working at an earlier \nage, to reduce\n\n[[Page S5619]]\n\nthe amount of saving and investing, and to cut back on their \nentrepreneurial activities. Once these Americans reach a certain age, \nthere is less incentive to further build up the estate because that \nsimply increases the tax burden for the loved ones they leave behind.\n  That is not the right message to send. We should encourage the \ncreation of jobs, new ideas, and new investment in our country. We \nshould encourage our citizens to continue to strive for the American \ndream of working hard, building up their assets, and passing them on to \nfuture generations.\n  I am disappointed that efforts to repeal the death tax have been \nblocked in the Senate for the last few years, and I hope Congress will \nenact a full and permanent repeal.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, this bill to repeal the estate tax is \nunfair and unaffordable. Full repeal is estimated by the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation to cost $776 billion over the first 10 years it \nis in full effect. And in fact that cost would be nearly $1 trillion \nwhen interest payments on the extra debt that would be required are \ntaken into account.\n  Repealing the estate tax would only benefit a tiny percentage of the \nvery wealthiest Americans among us by enabling them to pass additional \nmillions of dollars to their heirs tax-free. It would shift an even \nlarger share of the Nation's tax burden and debt onto the backs of \naverage working families and our children and grandchildren.\n  Only a tiny fraction of estates pay the estate tax. In 2004, only 1 \npercent of estates in Michigan and 1.2 percent nationwide paid any \nestate tax. In 2006, those numbers will likely be even smaller because \neach individual's exemption from the estate tax will increase from $1.5 \nmillion to $2 million, with those numbers doubled for married couples. \nIn fact, it is estimated that in 2006, just one-half of 1 percent of \nall estates will owe any estate tax. This percentage will continue to \nshrink as the exemption level rises. By 2009, when $3.5 million--$7 \nmillion for married couples--will be exempt, only three out of every \n1,000 estates will owe any estate tax; that's one-third of 1 percent.\n  Why are the Republican leaders pressing this? Over the last decade, a \nmassive public relations campaign funded by a handful of families has \nsucceeded in creating the mistaken impression that the estate tax \ncatches millions of average Americans. According to a recent report by \ntwo nonprofit organizations, Public Citizen and United for a Fair \nEconomy, 18 families worth a total of $185.5 billion quietly financed \nand coordinated a 10-year effort to repeal the estate tax. The report \ntells how these families spent over $200 million contributing to \npolitical campaigns, financing outside lobby groups and trade \nassociations, and creating a massive anti-estate tax coalition that \nserved as the main coordinator of the repeal campaign.\n  The advocates of repeal have not been forthcoming about the billions \nthey would save if the estate tax were repealed, but instead they have \npromoted stories about the effects of the estate tax on family farms \nand small businesses. Such family-run enterprises make up the core of \nthe American economy and society, so it is no surprise that using them \nas the poster children in the campaign for repeal has been met with \nsome public relations success. The well-funded initiative has left many \nwith the mistaken impression that the estate tax requires many small \nbusinesses and family farms to be sold to cover the estate tax bill.\n  Few, if any, examples of that are ever offered, but no matter. The \ndisinformation campaign continues. What is the reality? According to \ndata from the Tax Policy Center, of the 18,800 taxable estates in 2004, \nthere were only 440--or two percent--in which farm or business assets \nmade up at least half the total value of the estate. Forty percent of \nthese 440 farm and business estates were valued at less than $2 million \nand paid an effective tax rate of only 1.6 percent.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, at the upcoming \nexemption level of $3.5 million, only 200 farms in the year 2000 would \nhave had to even file the estate tax, and fewer than 15 of those \nestates would have lacked sufficient liquidity to pay the estate tax.\n  From these numbers, it is clear that an exemption level and other \nsafeguards can be set to keep effectively all small businesses and \nfamily farms from having to sell their businesses to pay the tax. That \nis why I hope that at some point in the near future we will be able to \nadopt a commonsense proposal to permanently set an appropriate, \ninflation-adjusted exemption level.\n  But proceeding to this bill at this time would not achieve that goal. \nThe majority has indicated that if we proceed to debate this bill, \nconsideration would be limited to a small number of predetermined \namendments, each of which would set the tax rate on inherited wealth \nlower than the tax rate on workers' wages. Giving tax preference to \ninheritance over workers' wages is not the American way.\n  Furthermore, in the face of mounting deficits, adoption of any of the \nso-called compromise amendments being talked about would be fiscally \nirresponsible and would unfairly burden average taxpayers to make up \nthe difference in lost revenue from the Treasury. The proposal endorsed \nby Senator Kyl would still cost eighty-four percent of the cost of full \nrepeal.\n  The estate tax was created not only to raise revenue but also to \nprevent the concentration of wealth in the hands of just a few \nfamilies. It ensures that those who prosper so greatly in the American \neconomic system do their fair share to contribute to our continued \nnational well-being. Just like other Americans, the very wealthy \nbenefit from public investment of tax dollars in areas such as defense, \nhomeland security, environmental protection and infrastructure, and \nthey rely even more than others on the Government's protection of \nindividual property rights. The estate tax is not intended to \ndiscourage people from seeing to it that their children are more \nsecure, but rather, it is aimed at helping keep avenues of opportunity \nopen to all citizens. In the words of President Teddy Roosevelt, who \nproposed the estate tax: ``[I]nherited economic power is as \ninconsistent with the ideals of this generation as inherited political \npower was inconsistent with the ideals of the generation which \nestablished our government.''\n  We should make sure that our current and future tax policies consider \nnot only the value to taxpayers of their take-home pay or accumulated \nwealth, but also the value to them of the essential government services \nthat are funded by their taxes. It is not a popular thing to talk about \nthese days, but our Nation relies on and needs tax revenues. Every day \nin Iraq and around the world our military needs tanks, aircraft \ncarriers and protective body armor. We need scientists working toward \ncures for cancer, Alzheimer's disease and birth defects. We need \nteachers to educate our children so they can keep our Nation \neconomically competitive in the next generation. We need USDA personnel \nto screen our meat and livestock for mad cow disease and harmful \ntoxins. We need Government grants to help buy bulletproof vests for the \ncops on our streets. We need dollars to build new bridges and highways \nto relieve congested traffic, as well as dollars to repair potholes in \nexisting roads.\n  On top of these things and many others we already appreciate, there \nare many other important initiatives: lowering the spiraling cost of \nhealthcare so that all Americans can get the care and medicine they \nneed, improving our education system so that every child grows up \nprepared to make a valuable contribution to our society, investing in \nleap-ahead energy technologies that will boost our auto industry and \nhelp end our dependence on imported oil, preserving our irreplaceable \nnatural resources, and protecting the jobs provided by our Nation's \nmanufacturers.\n  If we are to have any hope of paying for even a few of these \npriorities, eliminating the estate tax for the extremely wealthy is \nexactly the wrong thing to do. We are running record deficits and we \nare fighting a war in Iraq. We simply cannot afford such a massive tax \ncut which would push us even further into the deficit ditch. Today, \neach American citizen's share of the debt is almost $28,000, and as we \ncontinue to run up record yearly deficits, the country's total debt is \nestimated to reach over $12 trillion by 2016, which is $39,000 per \nperson. It is not just reckless fiscal and economic policy to saddle \nfuture generations with this kind of crushing\n\n[[Page S5620]]\n\ndebt burden; it is morally reprehensible to pass this kind of burden to \nour children and grandchildren.\n  We need to look out for all of our citizens, not just the few who are \nextraordinarily wealthy. I cannot agree with policy changes that favor \na handful of multimillionaires, one-third of 1 percent of our people \nwho are the very wealthiest, at the expense of working American \nfamilies and of critical national priorities. That is why I am opposed \nto repealing the estate tax.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, today we are debating repeal of the \nestate tax. Many of us have supported reform to the estate tax in a \nreasonable way that will help families keep their small businesses and \nfarms. But this debate about repeal of the estate tax has become \nunreasonable and fiscally irresponsible.\n  Some in the Republican majority are calling for full and permanent \nrepeal of the estate tax and have referred to the estate tax as \n``immoral'' and ``vicious.'' I disagree. Only very wealthy Americans \nwill benefit from the proposal before us today. It is a proposal that \ndoes not reward work, entrepreneurship, or innovation.\n  I also wonder why we are debating this today. The estate tax debate \nwas postponed last fall because of Hurricane Katrina. New Orleans is \nstill recovering and all signs point to the region being in dire need \nof more Federal assistance in the months to come. I believe it is still \nan inappropriate time to debate the estate tax. Congress just passed a \n$70 billion tax cut that will give those with an income of $1 million \nan average tax cut of $43,000. Additionally, we have had troops in \nAfghanistan since October of 2001 and in Iraq since March of 2003. This \nis a time for sacrifice, not time for another debt financed tax cut for \nthe richest Americans.\n  Congress is not sending the right message by debating the repeal of \nthe estate tax when soldiers are risking their lives and many citizens \nare still left homeless by Hurricane Katrina. The estate tax is simply \nthe wrong priority.\n  Only a few wealthy Americans will benefit from repeal of the estate \ntax, but it will harm many. Repeal hurts tens of millions of Americans \nby shifting even more of the tax burden from those who hold wealth to \nthose who work day in and day out to earn a paycheck. Since the \nproposal is not paid for, it hurts our children and grandchildren by \ncreating billions in debt and interest that they will have to pay for. \nAccording to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the total cost \nof repealing the estate tax for a decade would be nearly a trillion \ndollars. This revenue could be well spent on essential initiatives such \nas rebuilding the areas devastated by Hurricane Katrina, our national \ndefense, children's health care, equitable tax reform or paying down \nthe debt.\n  Repeal of the estate tax hurts millions of working families who need \nCongress to resolve far greater problems in our tax code, like the \npunishing and expanding alternative minimum tax, AMT. The AMT is levied \non taxpayers merely because they have children and happen to live in \nparticular States. Yet according to the majority leader, the estate \ntax--which is levied on individuals who will inherit at least several \nmillion dollars--is the ``cruelest and most unfair tax.'' I don't see \nthe logic in that argument and I am confident the American people can \nsee through it as well.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle argue that estate tax \nrepeal is needed to help small businesses, but I bet you would not hear \nthem discuss a provision in H.R. 8 that will result in increased \ncapital gains taxes for small firms. Under current law when a person \ninherits an asset, they receive a ``step-up'' in basis. This means that \nthe person inheriting the assets receives a tax basis increased to fair \nmarket value at time of death. When the person sells the property, he \nor she is only taxed on the difference between the sales price and the \nfair market value at the date of death.\n  H.R. 8 would limit the amount of assets that are eligible for step-up \nbasis. Assets exceeding $1.3 million would receive ``carryover'' basis \nunder which the heirs receive the same basis as the deceased owner. \nAssets of up to $4.3 million transferred to a spouse will receive step-\nup basis. Carryover basis usually results in higher capital gains taxes \nbecause tax will be owed on the difference between the sales price and \nthe basis that the decedent had in the asset. Certain assets will no \nlonger have step-up basis which gives heirs a basis equal to the fair \nmarket value at time of death. This change in basis will result in a \ngreater difference between the sale price and the heir's basis.\n  I agree that Congress should address the estate tax in the coming \nyears, but we need to keep in mind that the current uncertainty was \ncreated by the majority's unsound tax policy. It is because of the \nRepublican tax policies that the estate tax is now set to disappear in \n2010 and then return to its previous levels in 2011. We tried in the \npast to make estate tax relief permanent. In 2002, we proposed \nexempting estates of up to $4 billion and permanently reducing the top \nrate to 45 percent, but that was not acceptable to advocates for full \nrepeal. Now the Republican majority points to the problems they created \nwith earlier tax cuts as justification for repealing the estate tax--\ncreating further problems, greater inequity, and more debt.\n  According to a July 2005 Congressional Budget Office, CBO, report, \nvery few farms and small businesses will pay the estate tax if it is \nset at a reasonable level. The CBO report shows that if the exemption \nis set at $2 million, only 123 farms and 135 family-owned businesses \nwould have taxable estates and even fewer would have insufficient \nliquidity to pay the estate tax. Even if one disagrees with the CBO \nreport, we should all be able to agree that raising the exemption \namount helps small business and farms. Proposals that exempt \ninheritances above $3.5 million would overwhelmingly benefit those who \nown stocks and other securities and really have nothing to do with \nhelping family farms or businesses. If the exemption is increased to \n$3.5 million, only 0.3 percent of all estates would be affected. Many \nof these assets have never been taxed, given that assets of wealthy \nestate frequently include stocks that have never been taxed.\n  Often it is argued that the estate tax needs to be repealed to assist \nsmall businesses. There is no concrete evidence that a family-run \nbusiness has been put out of business by the estate tax. If the AMT is \nnot addressed it will hurt many more small businesses, but instead of \naddressing it, Republicans prefer to promote the myth that the estate \ntax shatters small businesses.\n  At a time when income inequality is increasing, the estate tax should \nnot be the priority of the Senate. According to the Federal Reserve's \nSurvey of Consumer Finances, the average net worth of an American \nfamily grew 6.3 percent while the bottom 40 percent of families' median \nnet worth fell.\n  When President Theodore Roosevelt advocated an estate tax nearly a \ncentury ago, he argued that, the ``man of great wealth owes a peculiar \nobligation to the state, because he derives special advantage from the \nmere existence of government.'' He further advocated, ``We are bound in \nhonor to refuse to listen to those men who make us desist from the \neffort to do away with the inequality, which means injustice; the \ninequality of right, opportunity, of privilege. We are bound in honor \nto strive to bring ever nearer the day when, as far as is humanly \npossible, we shall be able to realize the ideal that each man shall \nhave an equal opportunity to show the stuff that is in him by the way \nin which he renders service.'' We should heed the words of President \nRoosevelt and vote against estate tax repeal.\n  We need to return to a tax system of fairness and equity. Our tax \nsystem should reward work and create wealth for more people; it should \nnot be skewed to the wealthiest among us. We need to work together to \nfind a solution to the estate tax which reflects the reality of our \nfiscal situation and provides certainty for hard-working families.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, 5 years ago Congress took steps to end the \ndeath tax. Now the American people expect us to finish the job.\n  We need to end permanently the tax that punishes American values of \nsavings and investment and of building small businesses and family \nfarms and ranches.\n  The death tax punishes the American dream--making it virtually \nimpossible for the average American family to build wealth across \ngenerations.\n\n[[Page S5621]]\n\n  The death tax is anti-savings, anti-family, and anti-investment. It \nis quite simply un-American.\n  If we don't act now, the death tax will come back in just a few \nyears. Under current law the death tax is phased out in 2010 but comes \nback in full force in 2011. That is a ridiculous and untenable policy.\n  The death tax should be completely and permanently repealed now in \norder to make the Tax Code fairer and simpler and to eliminate the \nharmful drag this tax has on the economy.\n  According to the Small Business Administration, more than 70 percent \nof all family businesses do not survive through the second generation, \nand 8 percent do not make it to a third.\n  The death tax is one of the leading causes of the dissolution of \nsmall businesses.\n  It hits those who own small businesses and family farmers the most. \nWhen faced with the death tax, farmers and ranchers are in an \nespecially tough spot with most of their assets tied up in land and \nbuildings, livestock and equipment. This gives them little flexibility \nwhen settling estates. Unlike an investor with a stock portfolio, they \ncan't simply sell off a block of stocks and move on.\n  We can all understand budget shortfalls due to a multitude of \nnational and international events. But it is wrong to argue that we can \nshore up the budget by imposing a death tax on hard-working farmers and \nsmall business owners who are the backbone of the American economy.\n  In reality, the death tax collects little revenue, less than 1.5 \npercent of Federal revenue.\n  According to the CATO Institute, compliance with the death tax costs \nthe economy about what the Treasury collects.\n  A recent study analysis in 2005 by professors at Carnegie Mellon \nUniversity suggest that repeal would cause a net increase in Federal \nrevenues through dynamic growth effects and increased capital gains \nreceipt.\n  The Wall Street Journal has reported that repealing the death tax \nwould create an extra 200,000 jobs per year.\n  Debate usually focuses only on the taxes that estates actually pay, \nignoring the real costs this tax imposes on owners of small businesses \nand family farms. These include estate-planning costs, compliance costs \nat death, and overall economic growth.\n  Americans are paying millions of dollars every year to lawyers and \naccountants just hoping their children will not have to sell off the \nfamily business to pay the death taxes. Most small businesses and \nranches will not be viable if the children have to sell off half to pay \nthe tax.\n  That money would be much better spent creating jobs, upgrading family \nfarms, or saving for retirement or a child's college education.\n  Eliminating the death tax is a matter of fairness.\n  When folks work their entire lives to build up and pass on a business \nor family to their children, the kids should not get hit with a huge \ntax when they die. That is just not the American way.\n  Americans overwhelmingly agree that it is wrong to tax property and \nearnings that have already been taxed before. Polls consistently show \nover 70 percent of Americans support repeal.\n  Let's have the courage to separate death and taxes.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I want to take a few moments to discuss \nthe estate tax and explain why I support its permanent repeal.\n  I am well aware that many see the move to eliminate the estate tax as \nlittle more than a gift to the rich. In my home State of Utah, for \ninstance, the Salt Lake Tribune characterized the elimination of the \nestate tax as nothing more than ``subsidizing spoiled heiresses at the \nexpense of everyone else.''\n  I believe that while this is a commonly held view of the estate tax, \nit is an unfair and inaccurate pejorative of a principled policy \nposition. A punitive tax on inherited wealth is in no one's best \ninterest, least of all the people with no inherited wealth. The Tax \nCode should collect revenue in a way that does the least harm to \neconomic growth, and this goal should take precedence over any desire \nto punish the Paris Hiltons of the world.\n  Without a doubt, the high estate tax rate harms economic growth.\n  Perhaps our tax system's biggest flaw is that it taxes the returns to \ninvestment, usually more than once. When our employer pays us a dollar, \nboth the Federal and State governments gets their share. When we save \nwhat is left over by investing it in stocks or bonds, the government \ntakes another bite at the apple by getting a share of the profits of \nthe company in which we invested. And when the stock or bond delivers \nan investment return to us, we get to pay the tax man yet again.\n  The estate tax is often yet another layer of taxation on the \ninvestment. How many times does the government need a cut of our money?\n  At what point do we stand up and say: Don't tax more; spend less?\n  Because of the estate tax, people save less than they otherwise would \nand as a result businesses have less capital available to use to grow, \nexpand, and create jobs. With less investment, workers are less \nproductive and wages are lower than would otherwise be the case.\n  The Bush administration's signature economic achievement, in my view, \nhas been to lower the tax on dividends and capital gains, a change that \ndeserves much of the credit for the strong productivity growth of the \npast three years. This policy change greatly increased investment and \nthe concomitant growth in output has a lot to do with the simply \nincredible growth in tax revenue we have seen in the past 2 years.\n  It now appears that we will collect 30 percent more tax revenue this \nyear than we did just 2 years ago, according to the Congressional \nBudget Office. This is really incredible. Especially when you consider \nthat the economy was headed for a free fall just 5 years ago. Our \nefforts to cut taxes have saved our economy over the last 5 years.\n  A sensible tax system should tax income just once and at a low rate. \nThe inheritance tax does neither.\n  The current 46-percent estate tax rate borders on being confiscatory. \nChris Edwards of the Cato Institute reports that out of the 50 largest \neconomies in the world, we have the third highest estate tax rate.\n  Len Burman of the Urban Institute recently wrote that it is time for \nboth sides of the aisle to agree that the U.S. Tax Code should be \ndesigned solely to collect money in the most efficient way possible, so \nthat it does the least damage to economic growth. From that beginning \nwe can then move to address distributional issues outside of the scope \nof the Tax Code.\n  I believe this makes a lot of sense. Strong economic growth is in \neveryone's best interest, and we have not done a good job communicating \nthat fact to the American people. Too often economic growth is viewed \nas a barrier to a cleaner environment, or stronger families, or less \npoverty, when in fact nothing could be further from the truth. Nearly \neveryone in society benefits from a more productive economy, especially \nthose on the lower rung of the economic ladder.\n  The way to help the people at the bottom of the ladder is not to pull \ndown those at the top of the ladder, but to help those at the bottom to \nget the education and training they need to obtain and keep good jobs.\n  The estate tax as it currently stands represents a barrier to \neconomic growth, and it behooves us to remedy this situation as quickly \nas we can by making its repeal permanent.\n  Mr. BURNS. Madam President, I rise today to express my support for \nH.R. 8, a bill that would permanently repeal the death tax. This burden \nis especially harmful to many Montana farms, ranches, and small \nbusinesses. As we have heard many times in the past several days, the \nvalue of a person's estate is measured by its fair market value at the \ntime of death.\n  In Montana, as you can imagine, land value has appreciated \nsignificantly in recent years. When the death tax hits, often part of \nthe ranch or farm must be sold off to pay federal taxes. The death tax \nis not only about the wealthy--it harms working families in Montana who \nhave farmed or ranched on the same land for generations, but now, due \nto no fault of their own, are forced to give up their way of life just \nto pay the tax bill.\n  Land appreciation in Montana is a double-edged sword. While soaring \nproperty values benefit sellers and the\n\n[[Page S5622]]\n\nlocal tax base, for those with no intention to sell their property to \nthe highest bidder, the death tax helps make a difficult decision even \neasier. We already face high out-migration from frontier counties in \nMontana. It is difficult enough to keep younger generations involved in \nthe family business, but even harder when a death sets in motion a \nseries of unpleasant financial events, including payment of this \nburdensome tax. I have been a strong supporter of the permanent, full \nrepeal of the death tax. It isn't fair to families who have worked all \nof their lives to build assets and a way of life that then is taken \naway. At the very least, the Federal Government should not punish small \nbusinesses, farms, and ranches for filling such an important role vital \nto our economic well-being. I have spent a lot of time on these \nranches, and I am here to tell you that these Montanans are some of the \nhardest working people in the country. By and large, they are not \nmultimillionaires who purchase dude ranches as a pleasant distraction \nfrom the hustle and bustle of city life. These are folks who spend a \nlot of hot days in June swathing hay to make sure the cows are fed \nthroughout the winter. They invest blood, sweat, and tears, often for a \ndwindling profit. For example, let's look at the case of Mary Jo Lane \nfrom Livingston, MT. She wrote to me, saying:\n\n       My husband Tom operates the family ranch east of Livingston \n     on the Yellowstone River. My father-in-law, Tom Lane, Sr. is \n     the epitome of the American success story. His father was a \n     first generation American and his mother was an Irish \n     immigrant. He started ranching on his family's ranch out of \n     Three Forks with his brother and became a cattle buyer. \n     Through much hard work, determination and moderate living, \n     along with a little Irish luck, he was able to buy the \n     Livingston ranch in 1972, and his brother took over the ranch \n     in Three Forks. Over the last thirty years Tom Sr. has been \n     able to put together a ranching operation large enough to \n     keep all four of his sons working on the family ranch. In \n     addition to my husband on the Livingston ranch, his brothers \n     operate ranches in Cascade, Harlowton and Ismay. In 1972, I \n     am sure he never imagined what would happen to land values in \n     this area. The ultra-wealthy and celebrities have been \n     driving up land values which agriculturally we can never gain \n     enough income to support. This would be great for anyone \n     interested in selling their land, but it puts a huge burden \n     on the family rancher interested in maintaining the dream of \n     passing the land down to their kids and staying true to the \n     family heritage. With these new purchasers gaining land for \n     purely aesthetic reasons, with no consideration to generating \n     income from the land, we just can't keep up with rising \n     estate costs. In our case, we already know it is not a matter \n     of if we have to sell a piece of land, but which piece to \n     sell that will have the least effect on the operation. This \n     issue is not purely agricultural; it flows into so many other \n     segments of society. As you know, this land is like our \n     factory and when part of the factory is sold, that reduces \n     production which in turn reduces income and reduces taxes \n     paid to the government. No matter how much the land is \n     valued, it still requires about 25 acres to carry one cow/\n     calf pair. Consider too, what selling out does to the small \n     ag communities in the state that rely on ranchers to buy \n     their farming implements, parts, fuel, etc. etc. Estate taxes \n     have a direct impact on the environment as well. Ranches and \n     farms keep the Western land open, limiting development and \n     giving wildlife and people room to roam. Many people come \n     from all over America to visit our beautiful state, but they \n     don't appreciate the fact that the family rancher is paying \n     quite a price to keep it that way.\n\n  This experience shows how the death tax has affected just one working \nMontana ranch, and makes a powerful case for permanent and full repeal \nof the death tax. Another Montanan called the death tax ``un-American'' \nsince ``ranches are having to be sold in part or entirety to pay the \nestate tax.'' This point is well taken--the death tax is not levied \nonly against the rich, but against hard-working Montanans. Robert \nRumney from Cascade, MT, wrote:\n\n       My father has been building this family ranch for almost 50 \n     years, and I have been working with him full time for over 25 \n     years. This winter, we have been updating our estate \n     planning, so that my son and I will be able to continue to \n     work and live on this family ranch. We did research on fair \n     market value of ranch land, and came up with a very \n     conservative estimate of over $10,000,000 value. This \n     included land, cattle, and presently owned equipment. All of \n     these are absolutely necessary to continue to operate this \n     cattle ranch. With the recreational buyers driving up the \n     price of land far beyond its actual agricultural value, it is \n     becoming virtually impossible to pass on a long-time family \n     ag-operation to the next generation. What is this going to do \n     to our nation? What is the purpose of eliminating the family-\n     owned farm or ranch? The affluent buyers are not operating \n     these ranches as producers, but rather using them as private \n     hunting and fishing retreats. How are we going to feed our \n     nation? The estate tax of any kind is going to affect all of \n     us, not just the poor rancher or farmer who is trying to pass \n     along his hard work to the next generation. Please don't \n     allow this to happen. Please vote to eliminate the estate \n     tax.\n\n  Robert's letter points to an inevitable result stemming from the \ndeath tax. If our working farms and ranches are taxed out of existence, \nthe economic impact would extend far beyond these families, and would \naffect domestic agricultural production. This statement may well be a \nreality should the 55 percent tax rate come back in full force in 2011 \nwithout any congressional action. The death tax is unfair because it \nrepresents essentially a double taxation. Ms. Merelee Manuel from \nWinnett, MT, explained to me:\n\n       Dear Senator Conrad Burns,\n       I'm deeply concerned about the repeal of the Death \n     Inheritance Tax. I want to explain what happened to the \n     Gjerde Ranch. I was married to Bud Gjerde. We lost his Dad, \n     John Gjerde. We paid the death tax on the ranch when his \n     mother Margaret Gjerde inherited the ranch. She passed away \n     and death tax was paid again. Bud and I bought the ranch, and \n     then Bud passed away Feb. 3, 1975. The death tax was paid \n     again. This took place in a time span of 10 to 12 years. The \n     death tax was paid 3 times! We were NOT RICH. We saved and \n     scraped and did without so that we could put some savings \n     away for a rainy day. Guess what? It had to be used to pay \n     Death Inheritance Tax. This is the most unfair tax of all. \n     Income tax was being paid on this ranch every year. Please \n     don't think it's just the rich who benefit from not having to \n     pay death inheritance tax.\n\n  I think it's fair to say that Federal share of this ranch in Winnett \nwas far larger than it should have been. As this letter shows, it's \nbecoming more and more difficult to maintain the family farm in the \nwake of such excessive taxation. The death tax not only poses hardship \non Montana's farms and ranches, but on a variety of other small \nbusinesses. Donald Dulle, Jr., runs the Flathead Beverage Company in \nKalispell, MT. In a letter to me, he said:\n\n       I am counting on you to provide permanent relief from the \n     death tax so I may plan for the future of my business and my \n     family. Evidence has shown that a mere one-third of family-\n     owned business survive the next generation. Too often \n     liquidation is the only choice for family members who have \n     worked side by side with parents and siblings to create a \n     business of value in order to provide certainty for \n     generations to come. I urge you and your colleagues, \n     Democrats and Republicans alike, to put aside your \n     differences and demonstrate the leadership for which you were \n     elected by putting America's family-owned businesses first.\n\n  The damaging impact the death tax has on Montana's small businesses \nand estate planning is widespread. This experience is not limited to \njust a few Montana businesses but extends across the country. In the \nStatement of Administration Policy dated June 8, 2006, the \nadministration notes that ``Fundamentally, the death tax penalizes \nsavings and risk-taking, reduces capital formation in the economy, and \nultimately, reduces living standards . . . The time to fix this problem \nis now, so American families can plan for the future without worrying \nabout whether the death tax will reemerge.''\n\n  For those of you who may be familiar with the band the Beatles, they \nhad a song called the ``Taxman.'' Though the lyrics were written in \n1966, they still remain especially true today, even with a reference to \npayment of taxes at death. The lyrics say, ``Now my advice for those \nwho die, Declare the pennies on your eyes.''\n  In the Senate, we have tried to provide relief for small businesses. \nUnfortunately, we were prevented from continuing work on small business \nhealth plans. I urge my colleagues to support the full and permanent \nrepeal of the death tax to provide basic fairness to these small \nbusinesses that are the engine that drives not only Montana's economy, \nbut the Nation's as well.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, along with millions of Americans, I am \nacutely sensitive to the values of saving and hard work. Like citizens \nall across our country, many West Virginians devote their lives to \nacquiring and nurturing a family business or farm in order to pass it \non to a son or daughter. These forward-looking Americans ought not to \nhave to worry about their heirs losing the family heritage\n\n[[Page S5623]]\n\nbecause of the demands of the tax code. While I oppose full repeal of \nthe estate tax, I had hoped to support a compromise measure that would \nexempt small businesses and farms.\n  In order to debate the estate tax repeal, and work on an amendment \nexempting small businesses and farms, I had hoped to vote for cloture \non the motion to proceed. However, if cloture on the motion to proceed \nto the estate tax bill had been invoked, a compromise would not have \nbeen possible. The majority leadership indicated an intent to \nimmediately file cloture on the underlying bill, and then to limit \nvotes on amendments. The Senate would have then been forced to accept \nlegislation that could have cost the U.S. Treasury up to $1 trillion \nover 15 years.\n  If a realistic estate tax repeal is ever to be enacted, the Senate \nmust be allowed to fully debate and amend the estate tax repeal. Such a \nsweeping tax repeal should not be forced down the throat of the Senate \nwithout a thorough debate and the offering of reasonable amendments. \nUntil such time as an understanding is reached to fairly debate the \nmatter--including the offering of amendments--I must oppose taking up \nthe bill.\n  Mr. SMITH. Madam President, I would like to express my support for \ncompromise on reforming the ``death'' tax. I have always been a \nsupporter of full repeal of the estate tax. However, the votes are \nsimply not there. For America, small businesses, farmers, and others to \nget the full benefit of estate planning, they need to have something \npermanent--and not something that is suspended in 2010. Therefore, it \nis critical that we come together and support a compromise on the \nestate tax.\n  I believe that the greatest issue with the estate tax relates to \nsmall businesses. In many instances, upon the death of the owner, the \nfamily needs to sell its business in order to stay in business. This is \nnot good for our economy. It is important to remember that these \nearnings which go toward someone's net worth are earnings that if left \nin the economy would create jobs. In fact, the Heritage Foundation \nestimates that repeal of the estate tax could produce 240,000 new jobs \nper year. In my home State of Oregon, repeal would create over 3,000 \nnew jobs. Clearly, these dollars would do far more good for our economy \nif they are used for employing people and investing in plants and \nequipment than if you take them into the Government and redistribute \nthem through Washington.\n  Small business owners are out there taking the risks--and I believe \nthey should be left with the rewards. When running a small business, \nthere is no set calendar which guarantees you vacation or even weekends \noff. You are working all the time--even Christmas. Owning a small \nbusiness is a hard way to go, but it is also a great way to go if you \nhave the stamina for it. I applaud all small business owners. They are \nthe spark plugs of the American dream. Unfortunately, they tend to be \nunderappreciated in the halls of government. But small businesses are \ncentral to the progress of our country.\n  The compromise package that seems to have the most support would \nincrease the exemption limit to $5 million. Estates valued over $5 \nmillion but less than $30 million would be taxed at the capital gains \nrate of 15 percent--and estates over $30 million would be taxed at 30 \npercent. I think this is a reasonable approach. If your estate is over \n$30 million, you are at a place where you can hire the expensive \nlawyers and purchase the insurance policies. Basically, you can plan \nfor the next generation in ways that smaller businesses frankly find \nbefuddling and counterproductive to their continued employment and \noperation of their business.\n  Some argue that the estate tax is important because it redistributes \nincome between generations. But is it really the Government's business \nto redistribute income? My own sense is that it is better for the \neconomy if you leave the assets at home--with small businesses and with \nfamilies. In my opinion, the best redistributer of income and inherited \nwealth is freedom. Usually third generations will do very well or \nhorribly--thereby redistributing income through freedom.\n  Lots of people also argue that very few estates are subject to the \nestate tax today--and they are right. In Oregon, only about 400 estates \nwere subject to the estate tax in 2004. However, the reason that lots \nof estates don't pay the tax is because they are expending an \nextraordinary amount of money on insurance policies, lawyers, estate \nplanners, and accountants to try to get around it. These extra fees are \nthe equivalent of a tax for owners of small businesses and farms that \nneed to plan ahead to avoid the tax. Secondly, I believe these \nresources are better spent plowing them back into businesses and \ninvestments that are more productive than just accounting and \nlawyering.\n  It is time to put the death tax to rest. I believe that reasonable \npeople should be able to live with compromise. It will provide \ncertainty to small businesses and allow them to keep the rewards of \ntheir hard work.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support a compromise on the death tax.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, today the Senate is considering \nwhether to repeal the estate tax. I believe strongly there are problems \nwith the estate tax. Most importantly, it needs to be reformed so it \napplies to fewer people.\n  To ensure our Nation's economic competitiveness, government must \nreward thrift, hard work, and entrepreneurship. It cannot punish those \nwho have saved and worked hard. Instead, we should support our small \nbusinesses and family farms--the engine of economic growth in America.\n  To do this, Congress must raise the exemption for the estate tax. In \n2006, estates worth more than $2 million are subject to the tax. This \nis too low and subjects too many Americans to the estate tax. That \nexemption needs to be raised. The baby boomers are growing older and \napproaching retirement, and many have attained some measure of economic \nprosperity through their years of hard work. They should not be \npunished for this well-deserved success. Tripling the exemption to $6 \nmillion will make sure that the estate tax continues to target an \nextremely small group of very wealthy Americans. In fact, with an \nexemption of $6 million per person, or $12 million per couple, less \nthan 50 of all those who pass away in Maryland in 2006 will have to pay \nany estate taxes at all.\n  At the same time, I stand for a patriotic pause, which means not \npassing any new tax cuts until our Nation has paid for the war in Iraq \nand our troops. The war in Iraq is costing us $2 billion each week. \nWhere is the Iraqi oil that we were promised would help pay for this? \nThere cannot be a change in our revenue stream until the war is over--\nor paid for by Iraqi oil. If I have to choose between a tax cut or body \narmor for our troops, I choose body armor. Our first obligation must be \nto our troops.\n  War is not the time to be repealing the estate tax. Americans are \nputting their lives on the line to serve in Iraq and too many are \nmaking the ultimate sacrifice for their country. Now more than ever, we \ncannot afford to repeal the estate tax. But we must reform it.\n  I am a deficit Democrat. The Federal Government has a $337 billion \nbudget deficit. But that pales in comparison to our Nation's debt, \nwhich has risen to $8.3 trillion. It has been estimated that by 2015, \neach American family's share of our national debt will be $85,000. It \naffects us all.\n  I took the tough votes in 1990 and 1993 that led to a balanced \nbudget. They led to the first budget surplus in a generation. But most \nimportantly, those steps put the economy back on track and resulted in \n8 years of prosperity enjoyed by all Americans. We created 23 million \nnew jobs and increased wages. Inflation fell and unemployment dropped \nto historic lows.\n  Today, Congress must act responsibly. We should not be repealing the \nestate tax. We should be reforming it so it affects fewer people, \nprotects our small businesses, and so we can keep our Nation strong and \nsecure.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, let me say from the outset that I do not \nsupport full repeal of the estate tax. I have consistently voted \nagainst repealing this tax because of the impact it would have on the \ndeficit, as well as the possible chilling affect it could have on \ncharitable giving in this country. Having said that, I do recognize the \nneed for commonsense reform of the estate tax structure. However, due \nto our serious fiscal constraints, we\n\n[[Page S5624]]\n\nmust proceed very cautiously on this and all other federal tax and \nspending matters.\n  In his 1906 State of the Union Address, President Theodore Roosevelt \nproposed the creation of a Federal inheritance tax. Roosevelt \nexplained: ``The man of great wealth owes a peculiar obligation to the \nState because he derives special advantages from the mere existence of \ngovernment.'' Additionally, in a 1907 speech he said: ``Most great \ncivilized countries have an income tax and an inheritance tax. In my \njudgement both should be part of our system of federal taxation.'' He \nnoted, however, that such taxation should ``be aimed merely at the \ninheritance or transmission in their entirety of those fortunes swollen \nbeyond all healthy limits.''\n  I agree with President Roosevelt, and I remain opposed to full repeal \nof the estate tax. I have indicated, for several years now, that I am \nopen to considering a reasonable compromise that addresses the concerns \nof those on both sides of this issue. What constituted a fortune \n``swollen beyond all healthy limits'' in 1907 is very different from \nthe wealth we see today. I don't think it's unreasonable to raise the \namount exempted from estate taxes in order to protect America's family \nfarms and small businesses while maintaining the tax for huge fortunes. \nWe need to debate this issue and come to some kind of resolution. As we \nall know, our colleague, Senator Kyl, has worked very hard for a long \ntime to craft an alternative to full repeal. His compromise deserves to \nbe debated and voted on.\n  To his credit, the majority leader has consistently indicated that, \nif the Senate can secure cloture on a motion to proceed to legislation \ndealing with the estate tax, Senator Kyl would be recognized to offer \nhis alternative proposal as an amendment. Therefore, I am voting to \ninvoke cloture on the motion to proceed to H.R. 8 so that we can debate \nand vote on the Kyl alternative. In 2001, I stated that I supported \n``estate tax reform that will take into account the effect such reform \nwill have on our robust charitable community. For this and other \nreasons, I support a $5 million cap with regard to the estate tax \ncut.'' My position remains unchanged today. Senator Kyl's alternative \nproposal would put that $5 million cap in place. It is a good \ncompromise and is consistent with my longstanding views on this issue.\n  I want to be clear. This vote should in no way be viewed as a vote in \nsupport of full repeal of the estate tax. It is not. It is simply a \nvote to allow debate and amendments on the issue--with one of those \namendments being the alternative crafted by Senator Kyl. This vote is \nconsistent with both my longstanding opposition to full repeal of the \nestate tax as well as my support for a reasonable compromise. Again--I \ncontinue to oppose full repeal of the estate tax, but look forward to \nsupporting Senator Kyl's alternative proposal.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, how much time is it remaining on our \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 7 minute 45 seconds remaining on the \nRepublican side.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ntime be divided in the following way: Senators Sessions for 3 minutes, \nSenator DeMint for 2 minutes 45 seconds, and Senator Hutchison for 2 \nminutes, and that each be notified of their time when they come to that \nlimit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Texas. \nEarlier this year, 26 Senators signed a letter that I produced asking \nSenator Frist, the majority leader, to bring up this bill. He has \nworked hard to find the time, and here we are.\n  I recall, and I will set the record straight, that the death tax is \neliminated already in the year 2010. It goes to zero. But the next \nyear, the exemption is $1 million and the rate is 55 percent, a \nconfiscatory rate.\n  The American heritage is one of savings and frugality and a belief in \nthe right to own private property and leave that property to whomever \npeople choose on their death. That is why overwhelmingly people who are \nnot impacted by the death tax believe it is wrong and say in poll after \npoll it should be eliminated.\n  The cost of collecting this tax exceeds what it brings in to the \nGovernment coffers. That is the definition of a bad tax--the very \ndefinition of it. A good tax is one that is simple and fair and low \ncost to collect. This one is exactly the opposite, causing all kinds of \ngymnastics to avoid it.\n  Finally, and importantly, it savages growing closely held businesses. \nI think about one man I met traveling in Alabama. He and his sons own \nthree motels. He met with me and told me they were paying $80,000 a \nyear for a life insurance policy because when that father dies, it will \ntake that much life insurance, $7,000 a month, to pay the death tax.\n  They are competing with the big guys--Howard Johnson's, Holiday Inn, \nMarriott--trying to really get up there, but every month they are \npaying $7,000 that could be used to pay down the mortgage on their \nmotels and build a competitive business. That is why this tax is \nadversely impacting our country. It is against savings, it is against \nfrugality.\n  I received a call from Robert Johnson this week, head of Black \nEntertainment Television. He is competing with CBS, NBC, Fox, and ABC. \nHe is trying to do well. He has a family-held business. If something \nhappens to him, he said there is no other African American who can buy \nthis business. It is going to be bought up by some conglomerate.\n  I ask my colleagues to remember that CBS, ABC, FOX, and NBC never pay \na death tax. Holiday Inn never pays a death tax. It is the small, \nclosely held businesses that are expanding, have no cash for investing \nin their next new motel who compete with the big guys who have to suck \nout that money.\n  Those who want to keep estate tax claim repealing it will cost the \nGovernment too much money.\n  I would like to discuss this issue in some detail. They point to two \nGovernment reports--one by the Joint Committee on Taxation, or JCT, and \none by the Congressional Budget Office, or CBO. Both these reports \nassert that repealing the death tax will reduce Government revenues by \napproximately $280 billion from 2011 to 2015. However, simply put, \nthese cost estimates are not realistic.\n  Before discussing why, it is important to note that the JCT does not \ngenerally share the specifics of their revenue estimates, describe \ntheir methodology, or reveal their assumptions to the general public or \nMembers of Congress. We thus must speculate exactly how JCT arrives at \ntheir revenue projections. Of course, if the JCT is so confident in the \nquality of their estimates, one must ask why they are reluctant to \nreveal their methods and assumptions.\n  There are many reasons to believe that revenue loss estimates by JCT \nand CBO regarding repeal of death tax are on the ``high side.'' First, \nas Joint Economic Committee points out, JCT has estimated that the \ntotal revenue loss from death tax repeal would actually exceed revenue \nthe tax raises. This is a curious notion, to say the least. At the time \nof JCT's analysis, estate tax was expected to raise $218 billion from \n2011 to 2015--the 5-years after the death tax returns to its 55 percent \ntop rate. However, JCT estimates that over that same period of time, \nrepeal would lose $281 billion in revenue. In other words, revenue lost \nfrom estate tax repeal would equal 129 percent of the actual revenue \nthe tax is supposed to raise. A similar pattern exists for CBO estimate \nwhere revenue lost from repeal equals 120 percent of the actual revenue \nit is estimated to raise. This pattern--present in both estimates--\ncertainly begins to raise questions about these scores.\n  Second, passing the bill before us would eliminate the stepped-up \nbasis rule. What is the stepped-up basis rule? Current law allows \ninherited assets to be valued at their current market value at the time \nof decedent's death. The heirs get a stepped-up basis rather than \nhaving as a basis the original purchase price. No capital gains tax is \ntherefore applied to any increase in the value of that asset. This \nreduces capital gains tax collections significantly. For example, if an \nheir were to inherit a house valued at $250,000 that was originally \npurchased by her father for\n\n[[Page S5625]]\n\n$100,000, the daughter would pay no capital gains tax on the $150,000 \nincrease in the value of that home. The bill we are debating today \nwould effectively change this to require that a capital gains tax be \npaid on the full increase in the asset price from the time it was \noriginally purchased. As the Wall Street Journal pointed out this week, \nthe JCT has calculated that changing how inherited assets are treated \nin terms of capital gains tax law would raise $50 billion to $60 \nbillion a year. Most important, this $50 to $60 billion exceeds the \namount of revenue the estate tax raises annually, which has only \naccounted for 1 percent to 2 percent of all Federal receipts over the \nyears. In other words, the estate tax has not traditionally been a \nmajor source of revenue for the Federal Government and elimination of \nthe stepped-up basis rule should more than cover any loss of revenue \nfrom eliminating this tax.\n  A 2005 study from one econometrics firm--CONSAD Research \nCorporation--backs up this analysis. In particular, they found that the \nrevenue impact of permanent repeal coupled with a limited stepped-up \nbasis rule for the calculation of estates' capital gains realizations \nwould actually yield a small net gain in revenues through 2014.\n  Third, JCT and CBO scores ignore fact that existence of estate tax \nitself helps reduce income tax collections. For example, the estate tax \nencourages widespread tax avoidance, given its high top tax rate, which \nwould return to 55 percent if we do not pass this bill. To avoid paying \nthe estate tax, parents in high-income brackets often shift resources \nto their children in lower tax brackets, lowering income tax receipts. \nSimilarly, income tax revenue is lost when transfers are made to tax-\nexempt groups, such as charities and family trusts.\n  Existence of estate tax also reduces income tax collections by \nreducing the amount of capital in the economy. Joint Economic Committee \nestimates that the estate tax has resulted in $847 billion less in \nsavings and capital investment in the United States over the long run--\nin other words, investment in such assets as office buildings, \nretirement accounts, houses, factory equipment and so forth. Similarly, \nrecent studies have shown that the estate tax encourages consumption \nrather than savings and wealth accumulation, shrinking the size of \ntaxable estates.\n  In addition, according to Heritage Foundation economists, the estate \ntax costs our economy between 170,000 and 250,000 productive jobs each \nyear. These jobs are never created because the investments that would \nhave financed them are not made, as these resources are diverted to pay \nthe death tax itself or pay for complex trusts and insurance policies \nto avoid the tax. If these jobs were created, each of these 170,000 to \n250,000 individuals would be paying income tax, lessening revenue loss \nfrom estate tax repeal.\n  The estate tax also imposes an excessive compliance cost on \ntaxpayers, again lowering income tax collections. Estate planning can \nbe very complex, requiring the average family which engages in it to \nspend anywhere from $30,000 to $150,000 according to one study. It \nshould be noted that twice the number of estates were required in 2004 \nto file all the death tax paperwork than actually paid the tax. Many of \nthese filings require hiring lawyers and accountants at a significant \ncost to these estates. In fact, Alicia Munnell, a professor of finance \nat Boston College and a former member of President Clinton's Council of \nEconomic Advisers, has estimated that the costs of complying with \nestate tax laws are roughly the same as the revenue raised. In \nparticular, she has written that ``in the United States, resources \nspent on avoiding wealth transfer taxes are of the same general \nmagnitude as the yield.'' Similarly, she wrote in another article, \n``the compliance, or, more appropriately, the avoidance costs of the \ntransfer tax system may well approach the revenue yields.'' Put another \nway, for every dollar of tax revenue raised by the estate tax, Munnell \nestimates that another dollar is wasted simply to comply with or avoid \nthe tax.\n  Fourth, another reason it is safe to believe that the estimates we \nare discussing today are inaccurate is that, according to an analysis \nby the American Family Business Institute, the CBO underestimates \neconomic growth in its analysis and thus tax revenues. Specifically, in \nscoring revenue loss with repeal, CBO assumes that over the next 10 \nyears that real GDP growth will average 2.95 percent per year. This \nforecast is an underestimation of historical averages. Over the past 40 \nyears, average growth in GDP is 3.20 percent; the 30-year average is \n3.23 percent; the 20-year average is 3.11 percent; and the past 10-year \naverage is 3.34 percent. If we assume a 0.1 percent per year increase \nin GDP growth above CBO baseline, which would keep GDP below any of the \naverages I just mentioned, the result is a revenue loss from repeal of \nonly $87 billion over the next 10 years. In other words, revenue loss \nis more than 300 percent lower if we assume only a slightly higher \ngrowth in GDP, which is still lower than other recent 10-year GDP \naverages.\n  Finally, past estimates by JCT and CBO have been wildly off base. JCT \nforecast that the capital gains tax reduction enacted in 2003 would \n``cost'' $3 billion from fiscal years 2003 to 2005.\n  What happened? The cut in capital gains tax rate raised revenue. In \nfact, tax receipts from capital gains tax are now expected to be $87 \nbillion more than CBO originally predicted for years 2003 to 2006. \nSimilarly, JCT estimated total revenue loss for the first year of the \n2004 American JOBS Creation Act--a bill that provided several corporate \ntax cuts would be $4.5 billion. In reality, enactment of this law \nactually resulted in a revenue gain of $16 billion.\n  Finally, Congress reduced the capital gains rate from 28 to 20 \npercent in 1997. JCT estimated at that time that such a reduction would \nresult in a revenue loss of $21.2 billion over 10 years. However, over \nthe first 4 years following this rate reduction alone, revenues from \ncapital gains tax were $47.8 billion more than JCT estimates.\n  Given all these problems with the JCT and CBO estimates, what are we \nto believe about the cost of repealing the death tax? Personally, I \nbelieve that even though the Federal Government may lose some revenue \nfrom eliminating the estate tax, that amount will be negligible, if the \nGovernment loses any money at all. Thus, the argument that we cannot \nafford to eliminate the death tax is a hollow one. Two-thirds of the \nAmerican people support repeal of the death tax according to a recent \nsurvey.\n  It is time to follow their wishes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 3 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, we are being subjected, once again, to \nthe tired old Democratic song that Republicans are trying to help their \nrich friends, even though the other side has said only 2 or 3 out of \nevery 1,000 Americans pay this tax. They think we are doing this to get \nvotes. Even though they say only a small number of Americans pay this \ntax, the majority of Americans believe it is wrong because they know \nwhat Senator Sessions was just saying about a family-owned hotel chain, \nthat it is not just those who own it who will suffer if it is broken up \nand sold, that it is all the people who work for it.\n  So the question today is really when someone dies in America, should \ntheir property and possessions go to the Government, or should it stay \nworking in a family business or farm in producing jobs in this country?\n  One point I would like to make in this short period of time is, this \nestate tax does not benefit the average American. It does not help poor \nAmericans. In fact, it takes their job.\n  Just to deal with the death tax--and we have heard these figures \nbefore--lawyer and accountant fees are from $30,000 to $150,000, life \ninsurance policies, which Senator Sessions just mentioned, appraisal \ncosts, tax preparation--the cost of dealing with this is actually much \nmore than the revenue.\n  This chart reminds us that the revenue in the death tax is less than \n$25 billion a year, but the economic cost to our country is estimated \nat $847 billion in lost capital investment because of the death tax, a \nloss of over 100,000 jobs per year, and over $10 billion in lost \nincome.\n  The American people are not stupid. They know that while this tax may \nhit\n\n[[Page S5626]]\n\nthe wealthiest of Americans, that most of us as Americans work for \nthose family businesses or farms. It makes no sense to break up these \nbusinesses and send the money to the Government where it will not be \nnearly as effective in producing economic prosperity.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 2 minutes remaining.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, we passed a bill in 2001 that \nactually started lowering the death tax for a 10-year period, and then \nit will come back in full force. When it comes back in full force, we \nare going to have up to a 55-percent tax on estates that are over $1 \nmillion.\n  What does this mean? It means that if someone owns a farm where the \nproperty has appreciated but they cannot possibly produce enough on \nthat farm to pay one lump sum on its value--55 percent of it--we would \nbe breaking up family farms and ranches all over this country. That is \nwhat the death tax has been doing for years.\n  In fact, America has the highest death tax in the world. We say we \nare a country of small businesses, of family-owned businesses, \nentrepreneurs who have started with nothing and built something, and \nyet we do the very thing that hurts those small businesses. In fact, \nthey cannot pass to the next generation. Thirty percent of family \nbusinesses today pass to the second generation; 13 percent make it to \nthe third generation. That is because the property owned in a business \nis worth much more in value than it produces.\n  The death tax walks away from the American dream. The American dream \nis if you come to this country, if you work hard, you can give your \nchildren a better chance than you had. The American dream is that you \ncan start with nothing and you can build something if you work hard and \nyou have a good idea. But the death tax walks away from that because it \nbreaks up that family business, it breaks up the ability to accumulate \nwealth, it interferes with freedom and the free enterprise in this \ncountry today.\n  I hope we will not throw people out of jobs, as Senator DeMint just \nmentioned; that we will not prevent people from giving their kids a \nbetter chance than they had. Please vote for cloture today so that we \ncan do the right thing for our country and promote small farms, family-\nowned businesses, and entrepreneurship once again.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time has expired.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, it is my understanding that I will speak, \nthen Senator Frist will speak, and then we will have a vote; is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, first, I understand the people downtown \nand on 5th Avenue have come up with this death tax name, but this is an \nestate tax. If my wife or I die, there would be no tax. I would acquire \nthe property she had and vice versa. At such time as she and I pass \naway, and if there is a tax--of course, we have paid no tax on any of \nthis--when we pass away, there would be a tax perhaps. But if there was \na tax, one would have 14 years to pay it.\n  I want all within the sound of my voice to understand that 46 million \npeople have no health insurance, and there is not a word of debate in \nthe Senate. Gas prices are over $3 a gallon in Nevada. Minimum wage has \nnot been raised in years, and we are not doing anything on that in the \nSenate.\n  The Republican-dominated Congress just eliminated the tuition tax \ncredit, a credit for which one could get a tax benefit for sending \ntheir kids to college. We are not working on that issue.\n  We have a deficit approaching $9 trillion, and we are doing nothing \nabout that.\n  Stem cell research, to give hope to hundreds of thousands, if not \nmillions, of Americans with diseases such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, \ndiabetes, Lou Gehrig disease--we are not doing anything about that.\n  Prescription drugs for everyday Americans and for seniors--nothing.\n  Not one of these issues is before the Senate, but we are going to \ntalk about something today that affects two-tenths of 1 percent of the \npeople in America--two-tenths of 1 percent.\n  The estate tax is not high on the agenda of people in Nevada. I think \nwe are wasting precious days on divisive issues when there are so many \nother matters that deserve and demand our attention. Why aren't we \ndoing something in the Senate to address issues that affect 99.8 \npercent of the American people?\n  I haven't talked about the intractable war in Iraq. It rages on. Our \nsoldiers continue to fight valiantly, and heroic performance and \nsacrifice has not been matched, I don't believe, by the fact that we \nhave $50 million we need to spend to get the military up to the \nposition it was in when the war started. There has been deterioration \nof our equipment.\n  With respect to health care, there are 46 million Americans who have \nno health insurance. I think it is a national crisis.\n  The national debt--I mentioned that briefly--stands at $8.4 trillion \nright now and is scheduled to grow to $12 trillion by 2011, double what \nstood when President Bush took office. The national debt represents a \nbirth tax for our children, our children's children, and their \nchildren. The Senate is doing nothing to relieve the burden of the \nbirth tax. Why?\n  Well, we know the answer. The majority, the Senate Republicans, don't \nintend to fix these problems because so many of them are problems they \ncreated, and they don't want to call attention to them. That is why we \ndon't have legislation on which we can offer amendments.\n  So, instead, we have the estate tax on the Senate floor, the latest \neffort to distort, distract, and confuse Americans.\n  The estate tax is an extremely costly tax for a wealthy few that \ncomes at the expense of every American born and yet to be born for \ndecades to come. How costly? Roughly $1 trillion. And how few? Twelve \nthousand estates in America. We are a country of 280 million people. We \nare legislating here today for 12,000 people who are rich.\n\n  I think it is fair to say that Warren Buffett, George Soros, the \nGateses--billionaires--they have said very clearly that this tax should \nremain, that it is their obligation as rich people in America who have \nachieved the American dream to pay these taxes. But there are a few who \ndon't feel that way. As Senator Durbin indicated, $800-some-odd billion \nby people who are pushing this legislation by running full-page ads in \nnewspapers around the country.\n  Let me talk about some myths concerning the estate tax. First, some \nproponents of the estate tax repeal sponsored by about 18 families \nwould have us believe that it is a fiscal-free lunch. One group, the \nAmerican Family Business Institute, even claims that repealing the \nestate tax would increase the coffers of this country. Oh, that is so \nwrong.\n  The Joint Committee on Taxation has estimated revenue loss over the \nnext 10 years to be about $400 billion. Even President Bush's own \nTreasury Department says that repealing the estate tax will reduce \nFederal revenues. The Treasury Department puts the loss at about $340 \nbillion. That is only half the story.\n  According to the Tax Policy Center, a joint project of the Brookings \nInstitute and the Urban Institute--these are nonpartisan \norganizations--the revenue loss associated with repealing the estate \ntax over the first full 10 years it is in effect would be $750 billion. \nBut we have to borrow that money. So that would mean that this would be \nfinanced by China, Japan, Saudi Arabia, Great Britain, and other \ncountries. Over half the money now that we have borrowed doesn't come \nfrom Americans; it comes from foreign countries. So that is about $1 \ntrillion. Over 10 years, we can expect the national debt to increase by \n$1 trillion for 12,000 estates, two-tenths of 1 percent at the most.\n  The second myth is that we need to repeal the estate tax to protect \nand preserve small businesses and family farms. That is a myth. Very \nfew small businesses and family farms pay any estate tax, and an even \nsmaller fraction suffers any liquidity problems as a result of the tax. \nIn fact, the American Farm Bureau in California, the largest farm \nproducer in America--they grow the most, by far, of any State in the\n\n[[Page S5627]]\n\nUnion--the Farm Bureau was asked, Show us a single farm in California \nthat was forced to sell as a result of the tax. They could produce not \na single farm, not one.\n  It is a similar situation with small business. In fact, the Small \nBusiness Council of America has said that the repeal of the estate tax \nwill actually harm most small business owners because of how it would \nchange the tax benefits they currently receive.\n  A third myth. We have a compromise. If there were ever a myth about a \ncompromise, listen to this beauty. For the first, I think it is $5 \nmillion or $10 million I read in the paper, no tax. None. Then, after \nyou have over $5 million or $10 million, or whatever the bottom figure \nis, then the tax goes up to the outrageous sum of 15 percent. Over $30 \nmillion, then it goes up to 30 percent. Someone who is worth $30 \nmillion net--that is a lot of money--and it would even be more than \nthat because you would subtract stuff to get to the net estate--they \nwould be paying less taxes than somebody who works in Henderson, NV at \none of the industrial plants. They pay more taxes, somebody working for \nwages, than somebody with that kind of money.\n  So the third myth perpetuated here by the majority is that the only \nway to reach a deal on the estate tax is by voting on a motion to \nproceed and foregoing your right to vote on all amendments, save one, \ndrafted by supporters of full repeal, and it is a full repeal anyway. \nIt amounts to about 85 or 90 percent of the lost revenue.\n  This country is bleeding in red ink. I support fiscally responsible \nreform of the estate tax, but anyone who knows the Senate and knows the \ncompromise proposal will quickly see that the majority's proposal \ndoesn't even pass the laugh test. The best way to bring Members \ntogether on a difficult issue is to let the Senate work its will. That \nis what is supposed to be done, with Members of both parties able to \noffer any amendment they choose and get a vote. Yet under the \nmajority's offer, only the most ardent supporter of repeal of the \nestate tax will be permitted to draft and offer an amendment. All other \nMembers would be denied that opportunity. That fact alone should tell \npeople our majority friends are not serious about letting the Senate \nwork its will to develop a true bipartisan compromise.\n  But it is even worse than that. No one I know has seen the actual \nlanguage of the so-called compromise--only what was in the newspapers--\nand there certainly has not been any actual score of how much it would \ncost. But on descriptions of the amendment we have seen in the press, \ncredible outside analysts have indicated this new proposal would cost \nabout $825 billion or $850 billion. As I have said, it is 85 or 90 \npercent of the cost of full repeal. Only those trying to sell the \npeople a bill of goods could possibly call something a compromise that \nis not a compromise when the costs are this large, are this close to \nfull repeal.\n  I don't know where the term ``a pig in a poke'' came from, but if \nthere were ever a description of what I think it means, that is, you \nhave a container and you put something in it and you wind up with \nnothing, this is it. This is an absolute farce.\n  I hope this Senate will not focus its attention on two-tenths of 1 \npercent of the American people and leave 285 million people still \nwondering when are we going to get some health insurance reform, when \nare we going to do something for health care, stem cell research, when \nare we going to do something about education costs. I can't imagine \nthat our Senate would do this with the red ink as far as you can see, \nand we are going to focus on two-tenths of 1 percent and leave \neveryone, including the folks wanting a minimum wage increase, out in \nthe cold as they have been for years. This is unfair. I would hope that \nwe would not vote for cloture on the motion to proceed. This is wrong.\n  Madam President, the majority leader is on his way. I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, Michael Caudle's father founded the \nGreenfield Lumber Company in Greenfield, TN in 1955. Michael's dad and \nhis granddad spent years building that business into the trusted, \nreliable family business that exists today. But when Michael's dad \npassed away 6 years ago in 2000, the business was put on the brink. The \nfamily at that time, all of a sudden, was forced to pay nearly $400,000 \nin death taxes and almost had to sell the business they had worked so \nhard to put together to pay the tax.\n  Michael says he hopes to pass that lumber company on to his children \nand his grandchildren. It is his life. It is what he has worked for: to \ngive them that sense of family pride and community, that pride and \ncommunity that his dad had passed on to him.\n  But like so many American families, his dream is threatened by what \nhas come to be known in my State as the ``buzzard tax,'' and by people \nwho don't see the value in preserving a hard-won family tradition, that \nname is appropriate.\n  One Tennessee couple told my office they decided not to trust their \nfate to the tax man. They sold their east Tennessee car dealership so \nthat if one of them were to die suddenly, the other one simply wouldn't \nhave to pay those exorbitant taxes; that burden wouldn't fall on their \nshoulders. They didn't want that buzzard picking apart that dream that \nthey had built together.\n  Fred Heinecke's parents, unfortunately, didn't know about that kind \nof tax planning. As Mr. Heinecke of Vanore, TN wrote to the Knoxville \nNews just this Saturday:\n\n       Current law allows a $4 million deduction for a couple. \n     That may be true if they die at the same time, such as in a \n     plane crash, but not if they die separately as most couples \n     do. I learned the hard way because my parents died a couple \n     years apart without a trust. When my mom died in 2003, I \n     wrote a painful check for over $300,000 to the Federal \n     government. This required the sale of property that had been \n     in the family for over 50 years.\n\n  Fred, like so many people, not only had to write that unexpected and \nhuge check to the Federal Government in order to pay, he had to \nnegotiate the sale of his parents' property at one of the worst moments \nin anybody's life, and that is the time of their death, the passing of \nhis mom. As Fred's story, which is so typical and like so many other \nstories, illustrates, this death tax is unfair. I think that is the \nstrongest argument of why we bring the repeal of the death tax back to \nthe floor today. It is time to bury it. It is time for it to go.\n  In a few moments we will have a vote on cloture on the motion to \nproceed to H.R. 8, and we need to be very clear about what this vote \nmeans. A vote in favor is a vote to move forward with this important \ndebate. A vote against is a vote to kill any chance of repealing or \neven reforming this onerous tax and is a vote in favor of returning the \ndeath tax to the pre-2001 confiscatory rate of 55 percent, an exemption \nof only $1 million per person.\n  Back in 2001, we passed a gradual phaseout of the death tax--real \nprogress. Under that 2001 Economic Growth Tax Relief and Reconciliation \nAct, the death tax is scheduled to disappear in 2010.\n  But under the terms of this compromise legislation, after 2010 it \ncomes roaring back with that tax level of 55 percent in 2011. That is \nwhy we need to act. We need a permanent fix, and that is what this vote \nis all about.\n  Last spring, the House passed a bill to make full repeal of the death \ntax permanent. They did so with strong bipartisan support. Over a year \nhas passed and thus now it is time for us to act.\n  Americans have broadly said they support repealing the death tax. In \na recent poll commissioned by the Tax Foundation, nearly 70 percent \npolled in favor of repeal.\n  With stories like Mr. Henicke's, it is not hard to understand why. We \nalready pay enough taxes over our lifetimes, whether it is a water tax, \na gas tax, a payroll tax, a utility tax, a cable tax, a property tax, a \nsales tax, an income tax--we are taxed every minute of our lives. We \nare taxed from that first cup of coffee in the morning to the time we \nflip off the lights at bedtime. In fact, we are taxed so much that one \nnonpartisan organization calculates\n\n[[Page S5628]]\n\nthat the first 5 months of the average American's salary is confiscated \nby the Government.\n  If you are an enterprising entrepreneur who has worked hard to grow a \nfamily business or to keep and maintain that family farm, your spouse \nand children can expect to hear the knock of the tax man right after \nthe Grim Reaper.\n  Some on the other side of the aisle argue that the death tax is a \ncritical stream of Federal revenue and that in any event it only hits \nthe superrich. Neither is true. Mounting evidence shows that once \nwidespread estate tax avoidance is accounted for, the death tax nets \nzero to negative tax revenue. Worse yet, the death tax may be \nresponsible for the loss of from as many as 170,000 to 250,000 \npotential jobs each year.\n  Meanwhile, it is not the superrich who are hardest hit by the death \ntax; family businesses bear the brunt. The Seattle Times Company \nreports that 89 percent of all taxable estates filed in 1995, before \nthe 2001 reform, were $2.5 million or less in size. What does this \nmean?\n\n       A family-owned business stands to lose nearly half of all \n     its assets when it passes from one generation to the next. \n     That is over half of everything, including land, buildings, \n     equipment, money and more--all because of the current estate \n     tax law which is really a tax on death. They sell out, \n     letting long-term employees go. Not because they want to. But \n     because they have to. And the echo reverberates through an \n     entire community.\n\n  Just yesterday I heard from farmers and western landowners and \nlistened to the damage, the harm they suffered as a result of this \ndeath tax. Some of my colleagues have said that the death tax doesn't \nhurt farmers, but the farmers simply take a different view. Many of \nthem are cash poor. They own land handed down from their parents. They \nknow there is no easy way their children can continue to work the land \nif they are subjected to this death tax, so rather than wait for the \ndeath tax to pick apart their family farm, they make plans to sell the \nland in advance. That is the part of the story that never gets told. \nThe death tax not only confiscates the honest earnings of the recently \ndeceased, it often forces families to divest themselves of that family \nenterprise.\n  In the past, when Congress enacted a death tax, it was at an \nextraordinary time of war, and the purpose was to raise temporary \nfunds. But after the war was over the death tax would go away, it was \nrepealed. But that changed in the last century. The death tax was \nimposed and has never been lifted. Instead, it became entrenched and it \ntook 90 years to roll back.\n  It is time to stop punishing America's entrepreneurs and job creators \nfor saving, for investing, and succeeding. The death tax tells people \nit is better to consume today than to invest for the future; to consume \ntoday rather than save for the future; to spend now and leave nothing \nfor later. That doesn't make sense. It is unfair.\n  On February 10 of this year I said the Senate would debate and decide \nthe fate of the death tax. That time is upon us. I urge my colleagues \nto cast their vote in favor of cloture, of proceeding to allow debate \non elimination of the death tax. If we do not, the death tax prevails. \nAmerica's family businesses lose and so do the workers they hire and \nthe communities they support. A vote for cloture is a vote to protect \nthese family traditions. It is a vote for what is right, for simple \nfairness.\n  We will turn to the vote in just a few moments. Again, this is a vote \non the motion to proceed to allow debate. It will require 60 votes on \nthis very important issue. If we get 60 votes--and I hope we do get \nthose 60 votes--I expect we will see a cloture motion on the underlying \nbill. If that underlying bill is not successful, I would think that we \nwould need to gather together to have compromise legislation, and I \nwould expect a vote on that as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, pursuant to rule \nXXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     proceed to Calendar No. 84, H.R. 8: to make the repeal of the \n     estate tax permanent.\n         Bill Frist, Jon Kyl, Jim Bunning, Conrad Burns, Richard \n           Burr, Tom Coburn, Wayne Allard, Craig Thomas, George \n           Allen, Judd Gregg, Johnny Isakson, David Vitter, John \n           Thune, Mike Crapo, Jeff Sessions, John Ensign, Rick \n           Santorum.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent the mandatory quorum call \nhas been waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the \nmotion to proceed to H.R. 8, an act to make repeal of the estate tax \npermanent, shall be brought to a close?

On this vote, the yeas are 57, the nays are \n41. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is rejected.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise to explain to the people of Wisconsin \nmy vote this morning on the estate tax.\n  The arguments surrounding estate tax repeal are muddled, and I \nbelieve there are important clarifications to make. First, small \nbusinesses and farms rarely--if ever--are forced to sell off assets or \nclose up shop to pay the tax. Under the current exemption, roughly 99 \npercent of estates owe nothing in estate taxes. When the exemption \nexpands to $2.5 million, 99.9 percent of all estates won't owe a dime. \nAccording to a report by the Tax Policy Center, in 2011, with a $3.5 \nmillion exemption, only two of every 100,000 people who die that year \nwould be subject to the estate tax.\n  The second explanation is of what the Senate voted on today. Today's \nvote was on a motion to proceed to a bill to repeal the estate tax. Not \nto proceed to a compromise or any other deal--but to full repeal.\n  I oppose full repeal of the estate tax. Our Nation can no longer \nafford this tax break for the very well off. I supported the 2001 tax \nbill because we were in a time of surplus. That is not the case today. \nNow we face huge deficits, deficits amplified by the war on terror and \nreconstructing the gulf coast. According to the non-partisan Center on \nBudget and Policy Priorities, permanently repealing the estate tax \nwould add about $1 trillion to our national debt from 2011 to 2021. We \ncannot afford, at this time, these kinds of costs.\n  Nevertheless, I do support estate tax reform, and I will work with my \ncolleagues towards that end.

Under the previous order, there will be 25 \nminutes for debate, equally divided between the Senator from Kansas, \nMr. Roberts, and the Senator from New York, Mrs. Clinton.\n  The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague, Senator \nClinton, to talk about an issue that demands our attention and action: \nthe potential for a pandemic flu outbreak and, more importantly, what \nwe can do about it.\n  Behind me I have a picture of a crowded emergency hospital at Fort \nRiley, KS, during the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic. That flu eventually \ntook the lives of more than 600,000 Americans and 50 million people \nworldwide. However, my colleagues may not be aware that the first human \ncases of the Spanish flu in the United States were discovered in my \nhome State of Kansas at Camp Funston in Fort Riley, KS.\n  On the morning of March 11th, 1918, a company cook reported to the \ncamp infirmary complaining about a bad cold. By noon, over 100 sick \nsoldiers suffering the same bad cold also reported to the infirmary. \nThese complaints of bad colds turned out to be the first cases of \nSpanish flu in America.\n  Within weeks, that influenza had spread to places as far away as \nCamps Hancock, Lewis, Sherman, and even to several hundred prisoners at \nSan Quentin. By the summer, the flu reached around the globe, killing \ntens of thousands of people.\n  This flu was so severe and damaging that attack plans during World \nWar I had to be altered or postponed because there were shortages of \nhealthy men to battle. The Spanish flu continued to spread all \nthroughout 1919. It reached its death toll of nearly 50 million people \nworldwide.\n  I yield to my distinguished colleague.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. Senator Roberts \nhas outlined the impact the 1918 flu outbreak had on Kansas, our \nNation, and the world. It is almost unimaginable that starting with \nthat one company cook, 50 million people worldwide died.\n  I will tell a different story about a public health success. In March \nof 1947, the City of New York faced an outbreak of smallpox when three \ncases appeared at a local hospital. On April 4, New York City began a \nmass vaccination campaign to prevent further cases from occurring.\n  Behind me is a photograph of Red Cross volunteers waiting to receive \na vaccination against this deadly disease. Over the next month, more \nthan 6 million people were inoculated against smallpox, the largest \nmass vaccination in United States history. Even President Truman, who \nwas scheduled to visit New York during this time, received a \nvaccination.\n  Through the cooperative efforts of local government employees, public \nhealth workers and an army of volunteers, an outbreak was averted. \nVaccinations took place at hospitals, schools, and police stations. \nFrequent press bulletins helped to ensure that people knew what was \nhappening and where they could go to have themselves and their families \nvaccinated. Our national public health system was able to respond both \nquickly and efficiently to contain this disease.\n  As the New York City Health Commissioner reported in the American \nJournal of Public Health later that year, never before had so many \npeople in one city been vaccinated in such a short time and on such \nshort notice. Thanks are due to the press and radio for giving so \ngenerously of their space and time to bring necessary information to \nthe public. Had it not been for them and the intelligent cooperation of \nthe public, the generosity of private physicians and volunteer workers, \nnotably from the American Red Cross, the American Women's Voluntary \nServices and former Air Raid Warden groups from World War II, it would \nhave been impossible to have achieved this remarkable record.\n  Senator Roberts and I are here today because we believe, half a \ncentury later, we face a similar public health issue. The looming \nthreat of pandemic influenza has caused our Federal Government to begin \nmobilizing for when--not if--avian flu hits our shores. We are \ninvesting in research for a vaccine, stockpiling medications, and \ntrying to develop plans for mass vaccinations.\n  If recent history is any indication, we may not be able to muster the \nsame response as we did in 1947 when Americans were still on a war \nfooting or had a mentality of working together. What is worrisome to me \nwhen I think about our country's preparedness is the fact we are not \neven prepared to deal with the seasonal influenza we face every single \nyear.\n  Since 2000, we have had four shortages of seasonal influenza vaccine. \nWe have seen senior citizens line up for hours to get flu shots. \nUnfortunately, we have seen some unscrupulous distributors trying to \nsell the flu vaccine to the highest bidder. Millions of Americans have \nchosen not to get vaccinated, despite the clear preventive effects of \nthe vaccine.\n  This is something we want to stress and that Senator Roberts and I \nhave been working on together to try to come up with some practical \nsolutions. This is a matter of preparedness, not a partisan issue. This \nis a matter of planning. It is a matter of ensuring that our health \ncare system can respond both to the annual flu outbreak and to the \nthreat of a pandemic flu. We believe we have a lot of work to do.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. As Senator Clinton has highlighted, the need to be \nprepared for both seasonal flu and a potential avian flu pandemic is \nabsolutely critical. Some believe the potential avian flu outbreak \ncould be as lethal as the 1918 Spanish flu. One cannot watch or read \nthe news without a report on the concern of flu reaching our shores.\n  In reality, human cases of avian flu have been discovered in 10 \ncountries. Three years ago there were only three confirmed cases of \navian flu in humans. Today these numbers have grown to over 224 human \ncases, 127 deaths.\n  In February, I took part in an avian flu exercise at the National \nDefense University. That exercise was called Global Tempest--aptly \nnamed. The exercise simulated a worst-case scenario flu pandemic, and \nparticipants from several Federal agencies, and Members of Congress, \ntook part in the event. We all served as advisers to the President.\n  The exercise showed firsthand how quickly our public health system \nand real critical infrastructure services can be simply overwhelmed, \nhow communication can easily break down and how panic can take hold \namongst the public. We were forced with the difficult decision of \nhaving to determine where limited medical supplies and personnel should \nbe targeted, how the Federal Government can sustain the private sector \nand try to mitigate the real economic effects of the pandemic, and if \nand when the Department of Defense should be called in to assist with \nthe civilian efforts.\n  This Global Tempest exercise and experience, along with understanding \nthe strength and the force of the Spanish flu in recent natural \ndisasters such as Hurricane Katrina, have taught us a valuable lesson. \nWe must be prepared at all levels to deal with the large-scale public \nhealth emergency such as the pandemic flu. This system must be able to \nrespond in any type of crisis. But, more importantly, this system must \nbe ready to respond before the crisis begins.\n  As chairman of the Senate Committee on Intelligence and a member of \nthe Senate Agriculture and Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittees, I take the threat of a flu pandemic seriously and view it \nnot only as a public health concern but a concern in regard to our \nnational security.\n  Senator Clinton is a fellow member of the HELP Committee. She shares \nthese concerns. However, we do not want to stand before our colleagues \nand our constituents, those watching today, and cause panic or alarm. \nThere have been no cases of the avian flu virus in the United States, \nnor has there been a human transmission of the disease in a form that \ncould fuel a pandemic. Instead, we stand together before all of our \ncolleagues hoping to motivate them to take the necessary steps to make \nsure we are adequately prepared, should avian flu take hold in\n\n[[Page S5630]]\n\nthe United States. We believe there are some weaknesses in our system \nthat we must strengthen so we can respond to a crisis.\n  Last week, I hosted a pandemic flu planning conference in Kansas with \nSenator Brownback and Governor Sebelius. The conference included other \nFederal, State, and local officials, the business community, \nuniversity, health providers, hospitals, school administrators, many \nother stakeholders who came together to make sure that Kansas is \nprepared in the event of an influenza pandemic. We identified the steps \nthat must be taken at the State and local level to plan for and respond \nto a flu pandemic.\n  At the Federal level, Senator Clinton and I took the lead last \nOctober and introduced legislation to help strengthen our Nation's flu \nvaccine system. The Influenza Vaccine Security Act takes a \ncomprehensive approach and includes several provisions to improve our \nvaccine market and delivery system for the seasonal flu. It also \nprovides the framework that is absolutely critical during a pandemic \nflu.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Senator Roberts is absolutely right. We believe it is \ncritical to ensure that our basic seasonal flu vaccine production and \ndistribution system is capable of delivering vaccines to all who need \nthem, especially with the threat of an avian flu pandemic moving over \nus. Thousands of people die in our country every year from seasonal \nflu. It makes sense to us that we need to get that system absolutely as \nefficient as it needs to be so that then we could handle a rapid \nvaccine production, mobilization, and delivery challenge in the event \nof pandemic flu. Because we don't have a system through which to track \nvaccines, we cannot ensure that supplies reach the highest priority \npopulations--including seniors and the chronically ill, those who \nshould get vaccinated as early as possible in any given flu season. \nMany physicians and other providers have contacted us to express \nfrustration at their continuing inability to accurately predict at \nwhich point they may be able to provide needed supplies of influenza \nvaccine to their patients. We do this in other parts of our economy. We \nroutinely use tracking devices to trace deliveries of other goods in \nthe private market. But yet we still cannot predict when a vaccine \norder placed in the summer might actually be provided to a doctor's \noffice or a hospital or another place where the flu vaccine can be \nadministered.\n  Our legislation, the Influenza Vaccine Security Act, would establish \na tracking system through which we could better trace the distribution \nof vaccine from the factory to the provider, and we could identify \ncounties with high numbers of priority populations. Then with that \nsystem in place, we could easily determine, in times of shortage, where \nthe vaccine was most needed and facilitate distribution to those areas. \nAll of this could take place in a matter of hours, rather than days or \nweeks, as it does now.\n  The tracking system in our legislation builds upon the current \nprivate system of distribution. It has received support from vaccine \nmanufacturers and public health groups. Linking information through a \nnational database can be done in a manner that does not jeopardize \nfree-market competition but actually assists it.\n  It simply makes sense to establish a tracking system for vaccine \ndistribution that can be used in both seasonal and pandemic events, to \nhave that system already operational rather than to rely on untried \nmechanisms in emergency situations when we would already be facing all \nthe multiple challenges of delivering health care.\n  We recognize that many entities in our States as well as around the \ncountry may not have the technology or infrastructure in place for a \nvaccine tracking system. That is why our bill also creates a \ndemonstration program that authorizes the Centers for Disease Control, \nworking together with State and local health departments, to provide \ndemonstration grants to health care institutions to assist them in \ninformation technology upgrades to allow these institutions to improve \ntheir ability to report and track flu vaccine dissemination.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Senator Clinton and I also recognize the very critical \nneed for domestic-based vaccine manufacturers and an increased \nproduction capacity in the event of a flu vaccine shortage or some kind \nof a public health emergency that would require a mass need for \nvaccines or any other countermeasure. That is why our bill improves the \nability of the current manufacturers to remain in the U.S. market and \nencourages more companies to enter the market with domestic-based \nproduction facilities. We provide grants to manufacturers for technical \nassistance from the Food and Drug Administration and grants for capital \nimprovements in technology or production capacity.\n  Our bill also addresses the need to quickly find the medical \nprofessionals in the event of an emergency. We require the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention to work with our State and local health \ndepartments to develop a registry, if you will, of medical personnel \nwho can provide services during a public health emergency. Such a \nsystem was required under the Bioterrorism Act passed by Congress 4 \nyears ago. But there is still no working system in place. This is \nunacceptable. We must have a system that can easily identify doctors \nand other health professionals who can assist during a public health \nemergency--that is common sense--especially during an emergency that \naffects many areas across State lines. This will allow our Federal, \nState, and local officials to move quickly and efficiently to provide \nMedicare to those in need.\n  During Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath, I heard from many doctors \nand other health professionals across Kansas--I am sure the Senator \nfrom New York did as well--who wanted to volunteer their time in the \ngulf coast area. However, their desire to help those in need was \nhampered by the inability of Government officials to easily identify \na doctor who was credentialed or other health providers from other \nStates who could provide care. This is why Senator Clinton and I now \nstand before our colleagues to stress that we can no longer wait for \nthe development of such a registry of medical personnel. We are working \nand will continue to work with the HELP Committee to make sure this is \na priority in the bioterrorism reauthorization.\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Senator Roberts and I also believe that reforming the \nflu vaccine system requires increasing demand for vaccinations. This \nbill increases the funding for CDC's educational initiatives and sets \nup grants through State and local health departments, in collaboration \nwith health care institutions, insurance companies, and patient groups, \nto increase vaccination rates among Americans but particularly among \npriority populations--the elderly, the chronically ill, and those for \nwhom the seasonal flu is a particular risk. We have made progress. \nBetween 1989 and 1990, flu vaccination rates among senior citizens \ndoubled from 33 percent to 66 percent of the population. But we need to \nget those numbers up even higher to try to meet the Healthy People 2010 \ngoal of having 90 percent of our seniors receive an annual flu vaccine. \nWe have to get more information out to people about why this is \nimportant.\n  This is especially critical if we are confronted with pandemic flu. \nMany people last year wanted to get a seasonal flu vaccine, because \nthey thought it would protect them against pandemic flu. The \ninformation was not clear. It wasn't getting out in the right ways. We \nneed to do more to help find reliable sources of information in \ncommunities.\n  I want to add another point about the funding for research that we \nare advocating. We think we should have new vaccine-based technologies, \nsuch as cell-based technology. We rely on production methods that \nhaven't kept pace with the advances in medical science. In order to \nmake a vaccine today, strains of influenza virus are cultivated in \nchicken eggs. That is a nonsterile environment. Many of the \ncontamination problems we have seen over the last several years have \nresulted because of this cultivation process. Although we still have to \nrely on this technology, Senator Roberts and I would like to expedite \nthe efforts to increase research into safer, faster, more reliable \nmethods of vaccine production.\n  I have to emphasize again, however, it is not research alone that \nwill help\n\n[[Page S5631]]\n\nus. We can't do great research in the laboratory but then not know \nwhere the vaccine is, how to track it and to get it where it needs to \nbe, how to have good information sources. Senator Roberts discussed the \nwar game he participated in. There was a lot of confusion. We are \ntrying to cut through that to couple research efforts with the \ndevelopment of a system to track and distribute both seasonal and \npandemic influenza vaccine.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Over the last several months, the distinguished Senator \nfrom New York and myself have worked with our colleagues in the HELP \nCommittee to include the provisions of the bill we discuss today in the \nPublic Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act--\nthe reauthorization of that bill--or the BioShield II bill to be \nconsidered by the committee and the full Senate.\n  I thank especially Senators Burr, Enzi, and Kennedy, and their staffs \nfor their willingness to work with us. Senator Clinton and I strongly \nbelieve that the provisions of the bill we discuss today are absolutely \nrelevant and critical to these discussions.\n  We hope--it is not hope; we are going to insist--that these \nprovisions will be included in any legislation approved by the \ncommittee and Senate. As a matter of fact, were it parliamentarily \ncorrect, I would ask unanimous consent that the bill be read three \ntimes and passed now. We are thankful for all the attention and focus \non planning for a pandemic flu, but we also believe a few more steps \nneed to be taken to make sure we are ready. This is why we are urging \nour colleagues to consider our legislation, the Influenza Vaccine \nSecurity Act, and support our efforts on the bioterrorism and BioShield \nII bills.\n  I thank Senator Clinton for her hard work, dedication, and leadership \non this issue. I urge my colleagues to think about this and to support \nthis legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I thank Senator Roberts. He brings to \nthis issue the concern that he faces every day on the Intelligence \nCommittee. I agree with him absolutely. This is a national and homeland \nsecurity issue, as well as a health and economic one. I hope, working \nwith our colleagues on both sides of the aisle in the HELP Committee, \nwe can ensure that the provisions from our legislation will be included \nwithin the reauthorization of the bioterrorism and public health \nemergency legislation. We believe an ounce of prevention is truly worth \na pound of cure. We stand ready to work to move this as quickly as \npossible so we can get a system in place that we can then work on \nduring seasonal influenza time and be prepared for a pandemic flu.\n  I thank Senator Roberts and yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/08/senate-section/article/S5631-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5631-S5640]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   NATIVE HAWAIIAN GOVERNMENT REORGANIZATION ACT OF 2005--MOTION TO \n                                PROCEED\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of the motion to proceed to S. 147, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to S. 147, a bill to express the policy \n     of the United States regarding the United States relationship \n     with Native Hawaiians and to provide a process for the \n     recognition by the United States of the Native Hawaiian \n     governing entity.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 12:45 \np.m. will be equally divided between the two leaders or their \ndesignees.\n  The Republican whip.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the history of America has been one of \nracial inequity, followed by a long but sure path to reconciliation. At \nthe time of this country's founding, a person's race could determine \nwhether he lived in freedom or in slavery.\n  Fifty years ago, race could still determine where a person could \nlive, what water fountain he could drink from, or what kind of life he \ncould lead.\n  Today, thankfully, that is no longer true. We have recognized that \nnearly every time our Government has taken race into account when \ndealing with its citizens, the effects have been detrimental, if not \ndevastating; and for that reason, as President Kennedy once said, \n``Race has no place in American life or law.''\n  Unfortunately, today, the Senate is considering a bill that would \nwreck the progress we have made toward a color-blind society.\n  S. 147, the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act, would not \nonly direct the Government to establish a government based solely on \nrace, it would also seek to confer preferences based on race. It \nviolates the letter and the spirit of the U.S. Constitution, and it \nmust be opposed.\n  When I say the bill violates the U.S. Constitution, I am referring \nspecifically to the 14th amendment, which was ratified in 1868, after \nthe Civil War, to address unequal treatment based on race.\n  The 14th amendment reads:\n\n       All persons born or naturalized in the United States and \n     subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the \n     United States and of the State wherein they reside.\n       No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge \n     the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States \n     . . . nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the \n     equal protection of the laws.\n\n  The 14th amendment was quite clear. The way this bill tries to \nmaneuver around its unconstitutionality is by classifying Native \nHawaiians via the Federal Indian law system, and creating a new \n``tribe'' of Native Hawaiians.\n  But this new ``tribe'' is a shell game. Native Hawaiians have never \nbeen viewed as an Indian tribe, including when Hawaiians overwhelmingly \nvoted for statehood in 1959.\n  As recently as 1998, the State of Hawaii itself acknowledged that the \ntribal concept has no historical basis in Hawaii. Specifically, in Rice \nv. Cayetano, the State of Hawaii wrote the following in a brief to the \nU.S. Supreme Court. This is what the State of Hawaii had to say at that \ntime:\n\n       For the Indians the formerly independent sovereign entity \n     that governed them was the tribe, but for Native Hawaiians, \n     their formerly independent sovereign nation was the kingdom \n     of Hawaii, not any particular tribe or equivalent political \n     entity. . . .The tribal concept simply has no place in the \n     context of Hawaiian history.\n\n  That was in the brief of the State of Hawaii itself in a case in \n1998.\n  Mr. President, the Senate should be an institution that brings \nAmerica together. Let's not tear apart our common identity as \nAmericans. We should not use this fiction of Indian tribe status for \nNative Hawaiians to divide our country.\n  By the way, have I mentioned that not even the people of Hawaii \nsupport this bill? According to a poll conducted by the Grassroot \nInstitute of Hawaii, 67 percent of Hawaiians oppose it--two-thirds of \nthe State. Hawaiians overwhelmingly oppose this bill, based upon those \nsurvey results.\n  The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights conducted public hearings on S. \n147. They oppose it and recommend against its passage. They oppose it \nbecause they believe it is racially discriminatory and divisive. This \nis what the Commission on Civil Rights had to say about this measure:\n\n       The Commission recommends against the passage of the Native \n     Hawaiians Government Reorganization Act . . . or any other \n     legislation that would discriminate on the basis of race or \n     national origin and further subdivide the American people \n     into discrete subgroups accorded varying degrees of \n     privilege.\n\n  And it should be pointed out that it seems that private interests who \ncommented on the bill opposed it, with only institutional interests \nsubmitting comments in support of the bill. Only institutional \ninterests have advocated for it. But the people, it seems, do not want \nit.\n  That includes even some Native Hawaiians. One person who testified \nbefore the commission was a Hawaiian named Kaleihanamau Johnson. She \ntold them:\n\n       I am of Hawaiian, Caucasian and Chinese descent . . . and \n     do not support the Akaka bill.\n\n  Ms. Johnson went on to say that if this bill passes:\n\n       I will be forced to choose on which side of the fence to \n     stand. I will choose the Anglo-American tradition of the \n     right to life, liberty, property and the pursuit of \n     happiness. This will prevent me from recognizing all that is \n     Hawaiian in me. I consider the Akaka bill to be a proposal to \n     violate my rights.\n\n  Let me share some of the testimony of advocates of Hawaiian statehood \nfrom half a century ago. These comments show that Hawaiians entered the\n\n[[Page S5632]]\n\nUnion with the expectation of being equal to any other of our States. \nOverwhelmingly, Hawaiians were eager to be Americans. Senator Wallace \nBennett of Utah, the father of our good friend, the current Senator \nfrom Utah, said in 1954:\n\n       Hawaii is literally an American outpost in the Pacific, \n     completely reflecting the American scene, with its religious \n     variations, its cultural, business and agricultural customs, \n     and its politics.\n\n  And former Interior Secretary Fred Seaton wrote to a Senate committee \nin 1959:\n\n       Hawaii is truly American in every aspect of its life.\n\n  I sure hope that is true, in the sense that being American means we \ndo not define and divide people by race, but we transcend that. Every \nAmerican, regardless of race, has equal freedom to excel. That is why \nwe attract people of all races, from all over the world, who leave \nbehind what they have known and start new lives here.\n  Because we are a multiracial, multicultural society, and because of \nthe misfortunes that have transpired when this country has looked at \nits citizens through the prism of race, we must not turn racial \npreferences into law, as this bill would have us do.\n  I believe the way forward for our country is for the Government to \nfocus less and less on race, not more and more. To treat people \ndifferently based on race implies that, on some fundamental level, race \ndefines who we are.\n  I believe history has shown that idea to be bankrupt. And I believe \nthat America has led the way in proving it so.\n  Let's do our best to get this country to a point where race truly has \nno place, not when it comes to our Government, or to our promise of \nequal justice under the law.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side of the \naisle?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-one minutes.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I ask unanimous consent that I be allotted 10 minutes out \nof that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, yesterday, when I came to the floor and \nspoke on this legislation--the so-called Native Hawaiian legislation--I \nindicated that I had profound concerns about the constitutionality of \nthe bill. I might add that it is not sufficient for Members of Congress \nto say that the courts will clean up the mess after we pass the bill. \nIndeed, it is our responsibility to uphold and defend the Constitution \nas Members of the Senate.\n  Yesterday, we heard a few hours of discussion from both those who \nsupport and those who oppose the bill. I have made no secret of my \nopposition. Simply put, I cannot and I will not support a bill the \npurpose of which is to divide America and is based upon race, and which \nis clearly contrary to our fundamental American principle of equal \njustice under the law.\n  The bill would create a separate race-based government for Native \nHawaiians to the exclusion of all other Americans. And because of its \nvery focus on race, the legislation creates particularly troublesome \nconstitutional problems. In fact, it appears to be designed to be an \nend-run around the U.S. Supreme Court decision in the year 2000, in \nRice v. Cayetano, a Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals decision which has \nstruck down the practice of segmenting Hawaiians based upon race. I \nmentioned the 2000 decision in Rice v. Cayetano. That was a 7-to-2 \ndecision which struck down the ancestry requirements for voting for the \nOffice of Native Hawaiian Affairs trustee elections. The Court found \nthat because ancestry was a proxy for race and the election was an \naffair of the State, it was in violation of the Constitution, and \nparticularly the 15th amendment to the Constitution.\n  Justice Kennedy, writing for the majority, makes clear why the very \npurpose of S. 147 creates broad constitutional concerns:\n\n       One of the reasons race is treated as a forbidden \n     classification is that it demeans the dignity and worth of a \n     person to be judged by ancestry instead of by his or her own \n     merit and essential qualities. An inquiry into ancestral \n     lines is not consistent with respect based on the unique \n     personality each of us possesses, a respect the Constitution \n     itself secures in its concern for persons and citizens.\n\n  Some say this bill simply equates Native Hawaiians to Indian tribes. \nBut Congress cannot simply and arbitrarily create Indian tribes where \nthey don't exist. The Constitution does not authorize Congress to make \nIndian tribes out of subsets of Americans who have no relationship \nwhatsoever to an Indian tribe. The Supreme Court has been clear that \nCongress may not insulate a program from the Constitution's strict \nscrutiny for legal distinctions based upon race by ``bring[ing] a \ncommunity or body of people within the range of this [congressional] \npower by arbitrarily calling them an Indian tribe.''\n  In addition, the 14th amendment precludes the use of race in making \nappointments--something clearly contemplated by this bill. This bill \nperhaps most clearly raises constitutional concerns in its direct \ncontravention of the Supreme Court ruling in Rice. The legislation \nwould require that the Department of the Interior manage a special \nelection in which eligibility depends entirely on race. As I have \npointed out before, the Court made clear that racial restrictions \nrelating to Native Hawaiians is prohibited by the 15th amendment.\n  In summary, in its attempt to pigeonhole Native Hawaiians as \nequivalent to an Indian tribe and to create a governmental entity based \nentirely on race, S. 147 runs counter to the express letter and \ncertainly the spirit of the Constitution.\n  Unfortunately, despite these clear constitutional problems, it seems \nthat some in the Senate are content to acquiesce--to accept passing an \nunconstitutional bill, while passing the buck to the courts to bail us \nout. Yet just 2 days ago, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nwere talking about what they thought was ``wasting time'' on defending \nmarriage, a basic institution--perhaps the most basic institution--in \nour society.\n  And yet they are willing to spend a week debating a measure that has \nlittle chance of passing and that flies squarely in the face of the \nConstitution. I find these inconsistencies difficult to reconcile.\n  The sponsors of this legislation last year wrote a Dear Colleague \nletter that suggests that any constitutional inquiries should be left \nto the courts, the implication of which is Congress should not concern \nitself with the bill's constitutionality. I could not disagree more.\n  When I came to Washington, I, like the rest of my colleagues, swore \nan oath to defend and uphold the Constitution of the United States. \nThat pledge is non-negotiable and does not allow, much less require, me \nor any Member of the Senate to defer our obligations to pass \nlegislation that reasonably appears to be within the four corners of \nthe United States Constitution.\n  Congress is required to uphold the Constitution, as are judges. More \nimportantly, it is imperative that we pass legislation that furthers \nthe principles of the Constitution rather than dissolve them. A \nconstitutional commitment to equal justice for all would be undermined \nshould we choose today to endorse the creation of a race-based \ngovernment. This is not a question that should be passed off to the \ncourts. We should decide right here and right now.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against cloture on the motion to \nproceed. If they are serious about working on issues that really \nmatter, I urge them to allow the Senate to move on to consider other \npressing business.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I encourage my colleagues to vote with me \nto invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to S. 147, the Native \nHawaiian Government Reorganization Act of 2005.\n  I begin by expressing my deep appreciation to the cosponsors of this \nlegislation and to the Senators who spoke in support of bringing this \nbill forward for debate. I especially thank the Senator from Illinois, \nMr. Obama, and the ranking member of the Indian Affairs Committee, \nSenator Dorgan, for their support.\n  I also thank the Senators from Alaska who shared their experiences \nencountered 35 years ago when Alaska\n\n[[Page S5633]]\n\nNatives sought to address similar issues when Congress enacted the \nAlaska Natives Claims Settlement Act.\n  It is ironic that the same arguments used against that bill, which \nhas been incredibly successful and has served to unite rather than \ndivide the people of Alaska, are being used against our efforts today \nto bring parity in Federal policies to Hawaii's indigenous peoples.\n  Beginning with the debates of the Continental Congress and continuing \nin the records of discussion and correspondence amongst the Framers of \nthe Constitution, it was recognized that the aboriginal indigenous \npeople who occupied the lands now comprising the United States had a \nstatus as sovereigns that existed prior to the formation of the United \nStates.\n  Based upon the recognition of that preexisting sovereignty, the U.S. \nConstitution, article I, section 8, clause 3, vests the Congress with \nauthority to regulate commerce just as with foreign nations in numerous \nrulings of the last 215 years. The U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly \nheld that legislation enacted to address the special concerns and \nconditions of the native people of the United States is constitutional \nand does not constitute discrimination on the basis of race or \nethnicity because the sovereign status of the Indian tribes is a basis \nfor the government-to-government relationship that tribes have with the \nUnited States.\n  The court has consistently drawn a distinction between legislation \nthat addresses the conditions of native people of the United States and \nlegislation that addresses conditions of specific groups whose members \nare defined only by reference to their race or ethnicity.\n  According to the court decisions, the United States has a political \nand legal relationship with Indian tribes that is not predicated on \nrace or ethnicity but, rather, on sovereignty.\n  The status that the Constitution recognizes in Indian tribes was \nlater extended to Alaska Natives in their capacity as aboriginal \nindigenous people of the United States, and it is on that same basis \nthat the Congress has enacted legislation for aboriginal indigenous \npeople of Hawaii.\n  I know the senior Senator from Hawaii, Mr. Inouye, is going to \naddress this more when he speaks, but I want to comment on a disturbing \nconclusion that was made by some of my colleagues yesterday.\n  Somehow efforts to recognize Native Hawaiians are perceived as un-\nAmerican. Native Hawaiians are proud--proud--to be Americans. A number \nof Native Hawaiians in the Hawaiian National Guard returned from \nOperation Iraqi Freedom this spring, after having spent 18 months away \nfrom their families. Some of our most celebrated heroes who have died \nin the war have been Native Hawaiians. It is offensive to me as a \nveteran and as a Native Hawaiian that my efforts to ensure justice and \nparity for Hawaii's indigenous peoples are being characterized as un-\nAmerican. I beg to differ.\n  A federally recognized native government does not cause an indigenous \nperson to lose his or her status as an American citizen. The concepts \nare not mutually exclusive. I remind my colleagues of the 556 native \ngovernments that have federally recognized government-to-government \nrelationships with the United States. I don't see anyone characterizing \nour Native American brethren as being un-American. To do so in this \ncase is another injustice to indigenous peoples, not only from Hawaii \nbut from our great Nation.\n  The Senator from Tennessee, a good friend whom I admire, argued \nyesterday that this bill is about sovereignty. I agree, it is about \nsovereignty within the bounds of existing Federal law. The political \nand legal relationships between Native Hawaiians and the United States \nalready exist, as evidenced by the 160 Federal statutes that have been \nenacted to address conditions of Native Hawaiians.\n  The Federal policy of self-governance and self-determination allows \nfor a government-to-government relationship between indigenous peoples. \nThis is not new. It exists right now between the United States and 556 \nnative governments. The continued representation of this bill as \nunprecedented new action is just plain wrong.\n  Native Hawaiians are the indigenous aboriginal people of the lands \nwhich now comprise the State of Hawaii. Prior to their overthrow, the \nnative government, the Kingdom of Hawaii, was recognized by the United \nStates. The fact that the kingdom included non-natives within its \ngovernment does not make it a non-native government. It is clear that \nthe Kingdom of Hawaii was a preexisting native Government.\n  Hawaii is the homeland for Native Hawaiians. That is what makes them \ndifferent from other ethnic groups. That is what makes them like the \n556 native governments that are federally recognized and engaged in a \ngovernment-to-government relationship with the United States.\n  This bill embodies the goals of this Nation--fairness, justice, \nliberty for all. A federally recognized government-to-government \nrelationship with the United States does not make Native Hawaiians un-\nAmerican. Being Native Hawaiian and American are not mutually \nexclusive, no more than being an American Indian or Alaska Native and \nbeing American.\n  Mr. President, 556 native governments enjoy this relationship. The \nquestion is: Why not Native Hawaiians? The only argument I am hearing \nis that Native Hawaiians are not native enough, and I beg to differ. \nThis is why the bill needs to be brought to the floor for debate. This \nis why my colleagues should vote to invoke cloture on the motion to \nproceed. At a minimum, it is what the people of Hawaii deserve.\n  My colleagues have said that Hawaii is a melting pot, perhaps the \ngreatest melting pot in the United States, and I agree. However, I like \nto think of it not as a melting pot where everyone loses their \nindividuality, but I would like to think of it as a rainbow. Each color \nof the rainbow represents a different culture. The more we are in touch \nwith our culture and tradition, the brighter and more vivid is the \ncolor. Taken together, we combine to make something very beautiful.\n  My colleagues, however, would rather everyone be melded into one \ncolor, monotone. I believe we are intelligent, articulate beings who \nare able to celebrate our nationality in addition to preserving, \nunderstanding, and practicing our culture and traditions.\n  One of my colleagues referred to statehood and its supposed agreement \nthat Native Hawaiians would not be treated any differently from any \nother citizens. Debate transcripts from the Constitutional Convention \nof 1950, which developed the Constitution that was used in 1959 when \nHawaii became a State, clearly show an effort to protect Native \nHawaiians and their culture. The 1950 Constitutional Convention adopted \nas a provision the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act of 1920, passed by the \nCongress in 1921, which established a homesteading program for Native \nHawaiians in an attempt to offset the tremendous decline in their \nnumbers and to ensure continuation of their culture. The Convention \nalso adopted a provision accepting a compact with the Federal \nGovernment to continue the trust obligation associated with the \nHawaiian Homes Commission Act and providing that congressional consent \nwould be required for an amendment to decrease lessee benefits or alter \nlessee qualifications.\n\n  Inclusion in the Constitution as early as 1950 shows recognition of \nNative Hawaiians as Hawaii's indigenous peoples and reflects the \nwidespread support for the preservation of Native Hawaiian culture, \ncustom, and tradition. Unlike many of the other Western States' \nenabling laws, the Hawaii Admissions Act and the Alaska Statehood Act \nexpressly recognized and preserved the rights of the indigenous native \npeople in those two States. The Hawaii Admissions Act not only provides \nfor the protection of land set aside under Federal law for Native \nHawaiians but further directs that revenues from lands ceded back to \nthe State are to be used for five purposes, one of which is the \nbetterment of the conditions of Native Hawaiians.\n  I would also like to address the report issued by the U.S. Commission \non Civil Rights. The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights was established to \nserve as an independent and bipartisan factfinding agency to \ninvestigate and report on the status of civil rights in our country. \nThe GAO just issued a report highlighting the Commission's lack of \npolicies to ensure that its national products--its briefings, reports, \nand hearings--are objective and that the Commission is sufficiently \naccountable for decisions made on these projects.\n  Take this issue, for example. In January, the Commission determined \nit\n\n[[Page S5634]]\n\nwould hold a briefing on this legislation we are considering. The \nCommission failed--the Commission failed--to consult with the Hawaii \nState advisory committee, which is composed of experts on civil rights \nin Hawaii. This is not a new issue. In fact, the Hawaii State advisory \ncommittee has previously issued three reports addressing the political \nand legal relationship between Native Hawaiians and the United States. \nThe Hawaii State advisory committee members tried to participate in the \nprocess, and their efforts were rebuffed. This was not a case of being \noverlooked; this was a case of being shut out by that Commission.\n  The Commission was provided with a substitute amendment that we \nnegotiated with the executive branch in January by my staff. In \naddition, provisions of the amendment were discussed during that \nbriefing. Yet in May of this year, when the Commission voted to issue \nits report, it based its decision on the bill as reported out of \ncommittee, not the bill we will actually be debating and voting upon.\n  In addition, the Commission's report has no analysis, no findings in \nit. The report is a summary of testimony made by witnesses and a \nconclusion that the legislation is race-based--again, no analysis, no \nfindings.\n  Further, upon reviewing the transcript, it is clear to me that the \nmajority of the Commissioners were not familiar with Hawaii's history, \nwith Federal Indian law, or with the legislation itself at the \nbriefing. Again, this is where the expertise of the Hawaii State \nadvisory committee to the Commission would have been helpful, yet their \nefforts were rebuffed.\n  The two Commissioners who dissented read the bill. They read the \nbill. That was obvious in their dissents which actually analyze the \nbill and Hawaii's history.\n  I question such actions, as they leave me with little doubt that \nthere are those who used this process for political reasons--to the \ndetriment of Hawaii's indigenous peoples and the people of Hawaii. My \nconclusion is supported by the recent GAO report criticizing the \nCommission as lacking policies to ensure objectivity in its hearings \nand briefings and accountability in its conclusion. And they have \nissued that report.\n  In addition, on June 6, a Resolution of No Confidence was adopted by \ncurrent and former State advisory committee chairpersons regarding the \nCommission's commitment to fulfilling statutory and regulatory \nobligations to the State advisory committees. This saddens me greatly, \nas many of us have tremendous respect for the Commission. And I repeat, \nwe have tremendous respect for the Commission, but that respect is \nbased on our reliance on the Commission as an independent, bipartisan, \nfactfinding agency. There was little independence, bipartisanship, or \nfactfinding in the Commission's consideration of this legislation. That \nan agency with such an important mission would succumb to a political \nagenda is disgraceful and offensive.\n  Last night, the Department of Justice issued a letter expressing \nopposition to S. 147. This is understandable and, of course, not \nsurprising. The administration voiced these concerns last July. That \nprompted 3 months of negotiations with Hawaii's congressional \ndelegation and Governor with the Department of Justice, Office of \nManagement and Budget, and the White House officials. The result of \nthose negotiations is S. 3064, which the majority leader put on the \ncalendar this week. If the Senate invokes cloture on S. 147, the \nlanguage of S. 3064 will be offered as a substitute. That language, \nagreed to with the administration, addresses the administration's \npolicy concerns with the original bill.\n  The administration's letter of last July noted constitutional \nconcerns with the legislation. As the floor debate yesterday \ndemonstrated, disagreement over those constitutional questions exists \nand, if the legislation is enacted, would rightfully be left to the \ncourts to decide. The substitute amendment addresses liability of the \nUnited States, ensures that military readiness is preserved, prohibits \ngaming, and ensures that civil and criminal jurisdiction remains with \nthe State and Federal Governments until negotiated.\n  I ask my colleagues who have only had the time to listen to \ncharacterizations of the bill and sound bites of perceived impacts to \nactually take a look at this bill. It is not often that we can get \nalmost every policymaker in Hawaii to agree on an issue. Except for two \npeople in the State legislature, every other policymaker in Hawaii \nsupports authorizing a process for the reorganization and recognition \nof a Native Hawaiian governing entity for the purposes of a government-\nto-government relationship. We are the people who deal with this every \nday. I ask you, at a minimum, to give us an opportunity to share more \ninformation about this with you. Don't make your decision based on \nsomeone else's characterization of the bill if you have not taken the \ntime to read it and understand it. The people of Hawaii--native and \nnonnative--deserve more than that.\n  I stand here and ask my colleagues to vote for cloture so that we can \nfurther address these matters. I ask all of you to give us the courtesy \nof at least a debate on this bill.\n  I have heard the opposition, and again I say that we have had good \nrelationships which will continue, and I want to voice the reasons we \nneed this bill because as we pledge daily, under God, with liberty and \njustice, we do this.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. How much time is remaining on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 12 minutes 50 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask the Chair to notify me when 10 \nminutes has lapsed.\n  Mr. President, I wish to begin as I began yesterday, by expressing my \nrespect for the Senators from Hawaii, and it is genuine, it is a \ngenuine respect. I also wish to begin by making it absolutely clear \nthat there is no question about whether Hawaiians, including Native \nHawaiians, are Americans. Hawaiians, including Native Hawaiians, are \nAmericans, as good Americans as any Americans, and that is why this \nbill is a bad bill.\n  Hawaiians became U.S. citizens in 1900. They have saluted the \nAmerican flag. They have paid American taxes. They have fought in \nAmerican wars. The distinguished senior Senator from Hawaii has won the \nhighest honor our Nation gives to an American warrior. In 1959, 94 \npercent of Hawaiians reaffirmed that commitment to become Americans by \nvoting to become a State. Like citizens of every other State, Hawaiians \nvote in national elections.\n  My argument is that since Hawaiians have chosen to become Americans \nand distinguish themselves as Americans, that is the reason we should \nnot move forward to allow a small group of Hawaiians, who live in every \nState in the Nation, to form a new government, a sovereign entity, \nwhich would be empowered to negotiate, as was said yesterday on this \nfloor, the question of secession from the United States, the question \nof transfer of land to this new entity, the question of the transfer of \nmoney to this new entity, and the question of civil and criminal laws \nto this new entity.\n  When we began this discussion, many Senators were saying: Wait a \nminute, you are mischaracterizing this bill; it is not about \nsovereignty, it is not about land and money, it is not about race. But \nI think we have clearly established--and I believe it is a fair \ncharacterization of what the Senator from Hawaii has just said--that it \nis about sovereignty. It is clearly about race because you can't be a \nmember of this new government unless you have Native Hawaiian blood; it \nmay be only a drop of blood. So it is based on race. So the only \npossible argument to justify doing what no group of American citizens \nwould ever be allowed to do in the United States is that this is just \nanother Indian tribe, just another tribe. I want to address that in \njust a moment.\n\n  United States law, of course, does recognize Native American tribes, \nand the contention here today, from the Senators from Hawaii, is that \nthis is just another tribe. That is a different contention than the \nState of Hawaii made a few years ago, in 1998. There, in the case of \nRice v. Cayetano, the brief of the State of Hawaii said, ``the tribal \nconcept has simply no place in the context of Hawaiian history.'' This \nis what the State of Hawaii said in 1998 before the Supreme Court.\n\n[[Page S5635]]\n\n  Yesterday the Department of Justice Assistant Attorney General of the \nUnited States wrote a letter to the majority and minority leaders of \nthe U.S. Senate saying that the administration strongly opposes this \npiece of legislation. It first discusses the constitutional objection \nto creating a race-based government, which clearly violates our \nConstitution and turns that original motto of this country, ``from one, \nmany,'' upside-down. The letter from the Assistant Attorney General \ngoes on to say:\n\n       While this legislation seeks to address this issue by \n     affording federal tribal recognition to native Hawaiians, the \n     Supreme Court [of the United States] has noted that whether \n     native Hawaiians are eligible for tribal status is a ``matter \n     of dispute'' and of considerable moment and difficulty.\n\n  The Assistant Attorney General goes on:\n\n       Given the substantial historical structure and cultural \n     differences between native Hawaiians as a group and \n     recognized federal Indian tribes, tribal recognition is \n     inappropriate for native Hawaiians and would still raise \n     difficult constitutional issues.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the letter from the Assistant \nAttorney General printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                  Office of the Assistant Attorney\n\n\n                                                      General,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 7, 2006.\n     Hon. Bill Frist,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: The Administration strongly opposes \n     passage of S. 147. As noted recently by the U.S. Civil Rights \n     Commission, this bill risks ``further subdivid[ing] the \n     American people into discrete subgroups accorded varying \n     degrees of privilege.'' As the President has said, ``we must \n     . . . honor the great American tradition of the melting pot, \n     which has made us one nation out of many peoples.'' This bill \n     would reverse that great American tradition and divide people \n     by their race. Closely related to that policy concern, this \n     bill raises the serious threshold constitutional issues that \n     arise anytime legislation seeks to separate American citizens \n     into race-related classifications rather than ``according to \n     [their] own merit[s] and essential qualities.'' Indeed, in \n     the particular context of native Hawaiians, the Supreme Court \n     and lower Federal courts have invalidated state legislation \n     containing similar race-based qualifications for \n     participation in government entities and programs.\n       While this legislation seeks to address this issue by \n     affording federal tribal recognition to native Hawaiians, the \n     Supreme Court has noted that whether native Hawaiians are \n     eligible for tribal status is a ``matter of dispute'' and \n     ``of considerable moment and difficulty.'' Given the \n     substantial historical, structural and cultural differences \n     between native Hawaiians as a group and recognized federal \n     Indian tribes, tribal recognition is inappropriate for native \n     Hawaiians and would still raise difficult constitutional \n     issues.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             William E. Moschella,\n                                       Assistant Attorney General.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. As to the charge the U.S. Civil Rights Commission \ndidn't review this carefully, I will ask unanimous consent to have a \nletter to Senator Cornyn printed in the Record. It is from a member of \nthe Commission, Peter N. Kirsanow, writing in his individual capacity, \nwho details the careful attention, he says, that the Commission gave to \nthe legislation.\n  He says, in addition, ``I maintain that it is the worst piece of \nlegislation the commission has reviewed during my tenure.''\n  I ask unanimous consent to have that letter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Hon. John Cornyn,\n     Chairman, U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Immigration, Border \n         Security and Citizenship.\n       Dear Senator Cornyn: The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights \n     (``Commission'') found significant problems with the proposed \n     Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act (S. 147), also \n     known as the Akaka bill. I maintain that it is the worst \n     piece of legislation the Commission has reviewed during my \n     tenure.\n       The Commission went to great lengths to ensure that its \n     report on the Akaka bill (``Report'') was thorough, well-\n     reasoned and objective. Much of the Report was based upon \n     testimony from a balanced panel of expert witnesses. Public \n     comment on the Akaka bill also was solicited and a number of \n     responses were received from a variety of perspectives--both \n     pro and con. The ABA, for example, issued a letter supporting \n     the bill. Others opposed it. The Commission considered all of \n     these responses and modified the Report based on valid \n     concerns of those critical of some of the provisions in \n     earlier drafts. The final Report reflects these \n     recommendations, reaffirming its balance.\n       The Report was subjected to rigorous controls, several \n     layers of review, checks and balances to insure its accuracy \n     and integrity. Any attempt to discount the Report's findings \n     on the basis of a GAO report that the Commission somehow \n     lacks procedures for insuring objectivity is completely \n     misdirected. The GAO report cited by proponents of the Akaka \n     bill does not relate to the Report. Rather, the GAO's \n     findings relate largely to the lack of internal controls at \n     the Commission during and resulting from the previous \n     management that had failed, among other things, to conduct an \n     audit in 12 years; and was repeatedly excoriated for issuing \n     reports perceived as biased.\n       Since assuming a majority on the Commission over a year \n     ago, the Republican commissioners, along with our new \n     Democrat colleagues, have worked vigorously to adopt all \n     previous GAO reform recommendations and to implement a broad \n     series of internal controls and procedures to insure the \n     integrity of Commission reports. These procedures were \n     adopted well before the Commission hearing on the Akaka bill \n     and the issuance of the Report. (For example, the hearing had \n     an equal number of witnesses on each side of the issue, \n     something the Commission was not necessarily known for in \n     prior years).\n       The Commission's Report on the Akaka bill represents a \n     fair, rigorous and objective assessment of the bill. Although \n     I am writing in my individual capacity, I am sure that the \n     majority of my colleagues hope that the Senate, in it's \n     deliberations on the Akaka bill, gives the Report serious \n     consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                            Peter N. Kirsanow,\n\n                                                     Commissioner,\n                                  U.S. Commission on Civil Rights.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, what do we have here on the issue of \n``just another tribe''? Under the United States law, as we have said \nseveral times, there are specific requirements for the recognition of \nan Indian tribe. The U.S. Government does recognize those tribes. But \nit has not created any tribe. This would be the creation, the \nestablishment of a new sovereign government.\n  Here is what the law says:\n\n       The tribe must have operated as a sovereign for the last \n     100 years.\n\n  Native Hawaiians have not. It says:\n\n       Tribes must be a separate and distinct community.\n\n  Native Hawaiians are not. They live in every State of the United \nStates of America; 160,000 live outside of Hawaii. Only 20,000 live on \nthe Native Hawaiian homelands.\n  It further says:\n\n       A tribe must have had a preexisting political organization.\n\n  The Native Hawaiians did not. That is why, I suppose, the brief of \nthe State of Hawaii acknowledged in the Supreme Court of the United \nStates, in 1998, ``The tribal concept simply has no place in the \ncontext of Hawaiian history.''\n  In the history of our country, as it grew and developed, there have \nbeen many wrongs. The men who wrote our Constitution, setting our high \ngoals, were only men. And women didn't even have the right to vote in \nthe United States until 100 years ago. Those who wrote the Constitution \nlocked out the press. The press would say today that is a wrong. Those \nwho wrote the Constitution, many of them, owned slaves. That was a \nterrible wrong.\n  But our history is filled with reaching high goals to address and \ncorrect those wrongs, and doing it as a Nation, as Americans, all of us \ntogether. We are proud of our nationalities, of where we come from. But \nwhen we become Americans, as Hawaiians did when they became a State in \n1959, we pledge allegiance to the United States of America. This bill \nwould create a new competing government. That is what is wrong with \nthis bill. It is the wrong way to right whatever wrongs may have \nhappened in Hawaii.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 10 minutes.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. It is my hope that my colleagues will vote no on this \nbill. Perhaps there are other ways that the Congress can help the \ndistinguished Senators from Hawaii address wrongs which may have \nexisted in Hawaii. But if that motto means anything, ``E pluribus \nunum,'' and if the constitutional prohibition against making \ndistinctions based on race means anything, then we should not be \nauthorizing a new sovereign government capable of negotiating \nsecession, land, money, civil and criminal penalties--admission to \nwhich is only based upon race. The U.S. Department of Justice, the \nSupreme Court, the State of Hawaii itself--all have said this is not a \ntribe. Hawaiians are proud Americans,\n\n[[Page S5636]]\n\nwhich is why this bill should be rejected.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to S. 147, the \nNative Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act of 2006. We must \ncelebrate racial diversity in our Nation. Racial diversity defines the \ncultural norms and values that make America the ``melting pot'' that is \nso amazing. America's foundation is built upon many diverse races and \ncultures uniting to become one Nation, but while we can celebrate those \ndiverse cultures, we must remember that we are all Americans and we \nmust work to bridge gaps, not widen them.\n  Every day millions of Americans pledge their allegiance to our flag. \nThey stand for the freedoms and rights guaranteed by our Constitution. \nOne of the essential clauses of this pledge remains, ``one Nation, \nunder God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.'' A source of \nour strength is our diversity, and still, despite our diversity, we are \nmelded as one Nation, under God.\n  When I return to Wyoming, I often attend swearing in ceremonies. It \nis an honor to watch people become citizens of this great Nation. \nSwearing in ceremonies are moving experiences that I cherish. At a \nswearing in ceremony, people from every background and every nation \ncome together to celebrate America. Every American should take the time \nto watch a swearing in ceremony because when they do, they will realize \nthe privilege that comes with being an American citizen. They come in \nas citizens of India, China, Mexico, Germany, and many others, but they \nleave as Americans.\n  Although many citizens of this country practice and honor diverse \ntraditions that are unique to their culture, one core similarity \nexists: we are all Americans. Racial diversity is important, but it \nshould not be the rationale for the establishment of a separate \nsovereign government.\n  Wyoming is the home to the Eastern Shoshone and Northern Arapahoe \nTribes on the Wind River Indian Reservation. As part of the United \nStates, these tribes have been recognized for nearly 150 years as \nsovereign nations. The Eastern Shoshone community was granted \nsovereignty during the Treaty of Fort Laramie in 1863 before Wyoming \nbecame a State. Over the years, other Native American and Alaskan \ntribes gained sovereignty by meeting the criteria laid out in our laws. \nNative Hawaiians now seek sovereignty similar to that of Native \nAmericans and Alaskan Natives through this legislation.\n  While I understand their desire to be granted sovereign immunity, the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding Native Hawaiians are different. It \ndoes not make sense to waive or change the requirements that others had \nto meet.\n  Our Government has never created an Indian tribe. Sovereignty has \nonly been granted to preexisting tribes and only in special, rare \ncircumstances after statehood.\n  In order to be federally recognized, a tribe must meet several \ncriteria. A tribe must prove it existed and operated as a tribe for the \npast century. Additionally, the tribe must distinguish itself as a \nseparate and distinct community both geographically and culturally. \nFinally, the tribe must have a preexisting political structure that is \nclear. Native Hawaiians do not meet these criteria.\n  A distinct community does not exist according to the standards \noutlined in the proposed legislation. Within the United States and the \nState of Hawaii, Native Hawaiians live integrated among all races.\n  During the ``fall'' of Queen Liliuokalani, a ``Native Hawaiian'' \ngovernment was not present. All races coexisted under the reign of the \nmonarchy. Non-natives even held high positions within the government.\n  In 1898, at the time of annexation, there was no political effort to \ntreat Native Hawaiians similar to Alaska Natives or Native American \ntribes. The same held true when 94 percent of Hawaiians voted to become \na State in 1959. Ninety-four percent of Hawaiians voted to become \nAmericans. In fact, at that time, advocates of Hawaiian statehood \nemphasized the cohesive diversity, the ``melting pot'' nature of \nHawaii.\n  In addition, in 1998, the State of Hawaii's Supreme Court brief from \nthe case of Rice v. Cayetano expressed the government's belief that, \n``The Tribal concept simply has no place in the context of Hawaiian \nhistory.''\n  If the proposed legislation passes, the progress we have made over \nthe past century to improve racial equality regresses. Instead of \nuniting the country, we divide it, and some of the darkest hours of \nthis Nation occurred when people were separated because of race. This \nlegislation is based solely on the ideology of race.\n  We are all Americans, and as such, we need to be united. Although I \nrespect the desire of Native Hawaiians to be a federally recognized \nsovereign nation, I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose S. 147.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today we will vote on the motion to \nproceed to S. 147, the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act of \n2005. This legislation was passed by the Indian Affairs Committee on \nMarch 9, 2005. The bill is similar to a bill reported by the Committee \nduring the 108th Congress that was not brought before the full Senate.\n  S. 147 was developed to provide Native Hawaiians with a mechanism for \nself-governance and self-determination, which the bill's sponsors \nbelieve would protect from legal challenges a variety of programs and \nservices currently in place for the benefit of Native Hawaiians. To \nachieve this goal, the bill would establish a process that would permit \nNative Hawaiians to organize a sovereign entity that would have a legal \nrelationship with the United States similar to that which exists today \nbetween the United States and federally recognized Indian tribes.\n  I recognize that this legislation has been offered in response to \nmany legitimate concerns expressed by the members of the Hawaii \ndelegation and the State's Governor. The leaders of the State of Hawaii \nare attempting to ensure that a longstanding agreement between the \nFederal Government and Hawaii will not be jeopardized by litigants \ndetermined to undermine certain aspects of that agreement relating to \nNative Hawaiians. That does not change the fact that I have serious \ndoubts about the wisdom of this legislation.\n  The sponsors reached an agreement in the 108th Congress that they \nwould be afforded an opportunity to bring the bill to the Senate floor \nduring this Congress. To fulfill that agreement, in my capacity as the \nchairman of the Indian Affairs Committee, I have worked to ensure that \nthe legislation would be reported by the committee. I will also support \nthe motion to proceed to the bill's consideration because of the \nagreement that was reached in the last Congress. I would like the \nrecord to reflect clearly, though, that I am unequivocally opposed to \nthis bill and that I will not support its passage should cloture be \ninvoked.\n  Again, I do know how important this legislation is to the Senators \nfrom Hawaii and certainly to the very capable Governor of the 50th \nState. I am very much aware that one of the purposes of this \nlegislation is to insulate current Native Hawaiian programs from \nconstitutional attack in the courts, and I am sympathetic to that \npurpose. I commit to the Senators and the Governor that I remain \nwilling to work with them to address the fundamental legal concerns \nfacing their State. I also recognize the efforts made by Senator Akaka \nto address some of the criticisms that have been leveled at this \nlegislation. However, I still have a number of significant concerns \nwith this measure.\n  Foremost among these concerns is that, if enacted, S. 147 would \nresult in the formation of a sovereign government for Native Hawaiian \npeople. I am sure that the sponsors have good intentions, but I cannot \nturn away from the fact that this bill would lead to the creation of a \nnew nation based exclusively--not primarily, not in part, but \nexclusively--on race. In fact, any person with even a drop of Hawaiian \nblood would qualify to vote on the establishment of this new, \nlegislatively created entity that would then negotiate with the Federal \nGovernment of the United States and the State of Hawaii on potentially \nunlimited topics.\n  As the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights stated in its recent report \nrecommending against passage of S. 147, this bill would ``discriminate \non the basis of race'' and ``further subdivide\n\n[[Page S5637]]\n\nthe American people into discrete subgroups accorded varying degrees of \nprivilege.'' This is unacceptable to me, and it is unacceptable, I am \nsure, to most other citizens of this Nation who agree that we must \ncontinue our struggle to become and remain one people--all equal, all \nAmericans.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will use my leader time now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have had the good fortune to serve here in \nWashington almost a quarter of a century. I have had the good fortune \nof serving with wonderful people, both when I served in the House and \nwhen I have had the opportunity to serve here in the Senate. As I look \nback over the delegations from the respective States here during my \nservice in the Senate, there are no two finer men, no two finer persons \nwho have ever served in our Senate than the two Senators who now \nrepresent the State of Hawaii. Senator Akaka and Senator Inouye are two \nof the best.\n  Everyone knows, because I have stated here on the floor, how I feel \nabout Dan Inouye. I have never, ever known a person for whom I have \nmore respect and admiration than I do Dan Inouye. Think about that: A \nman who has earned the highest award this country can give for heroism, \nthe Medal of Honor; Dan Akaka, who served in the military.\n  We live in a country that is a Federal Government. What does that \nmean? It means, as I learned in college, that you have a central whole \ndivided among self-governing parts. What are those self-governing \nparts? It is the State of Nevada, it is the State of Florida, it is the \nState of Tennessee, and it is the State of Hawaii--plus 46 others; none \nbetter than the other. Hawaii is equal to Florida, to Tennessee, to \nNevada.\n  Let's talk about Nevada. Nevada has been a State for a long time, \nsince 1864. Hawaii is one of the two new kids on the block, along with \nAlaska. But take Nevada as an example. The State of Nevada has 22 \ndifferent Indian tribes and Indian entities. The State of Nevada knows \nthey are there. It works just fine. It doesn't take away our sense that \nwe are part of the Federal Government. We need to treat Hawaii as we do \nother States.\n  Some have said here that it is going to change the State of Hawaii. I \nthink we should give the Senators from the State of Hawaii a little bit \nof credit for doing what is right for their State. We are scheduled to \nvote in just a short time on a motion to proceed to S. 147, the Native \nHawaiian Government Reorganization Act. This vote provides all Senators \nan opportunity to do right by Native Hawaiians, and just as importantly \nby Hawaii's two very distinguished Senators, about whom I have just \nspoken.\n  A look at the historical record of Native Hawaiians demonstrates the \nimportance of this legislation. That is why the two Senators from \nHawaii have worked tirelessly on its behalf.\n  I can remember when this vote was scheduled previously. It was within \na day or two of when Katrina hit. In Washington at the time was the \nGovernor of the State of Hawaii. She believed just as strongly as these \ntwo men that it was good for Hawaii. It was bipartisan. She is a \nRepublican and these are two Democrats.\n  From their very first contacts with the western world more than two \ncenturies ago to today, Native Hawaiians have endured a lot--just as \nthe Native American Indians in Nevada endured a lot, a whole lot. While \nthe Native Hawaiians have done so much, with such quiet dignity and \ncourage, it should be clear to all of us that they now require our \nattention.\n  This legislation will do several things. First, it establishes a \nprocess for the reorganization of the Native Hawaiian Government \nAuthority. There is nothing wrong with that. There is nothing different \nfrom the Pyramid Paiute tribe in northern Nevada. Pyramid is named \nafter the lake there, Pyramid Lake.\n  It is no different from the Owyhee Indians in the northeastern part \nof our State. How would you get a name that sounds like Hawaii? Their \nreservation is Owyhee because well more than 100 years ago some \nHawaiians came there to trap, and that is the last we heard of them. \nBut the name never left. Hawaii, Owyhee. It is a sovereign tribe in \nNevada. It has Hawaiian roots--at least the name. We are proud of them, \nthe Indians. That reservation is made up of Shoshonis and Paiutes.\n  Second, this legislation, after the process has run its course and a \nNative Hawaiian governing entity is established, just like the tribal \ngovernment, Walker River, that we have with the Paiute tribe, the bill \nreaffirms the special political/legal relationship between the U.S. \nGovernment and that entity, just like the Las Vegas Indian colony.\n  Third and perhaps more important, in the words of an editorial in \nWednesday's New York Times, ``this legislation offers a chance for \njustice in Hawaii.''\n  Although arguments for why the Senate should address the legislation \nare crystal clear, I think the integrity of the U.S. Senate is on the \nline here. I think the integrity of the Senators who seek this \nopportunity merit attention. I have addressed myself to that.\n  The chance for justice in Hawaii--that is what this is all about. \nHawaii is no different than Nevada. Native Hawaiians are no different \nthan the Indians in Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6 minutes and 37 seconds.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, before proceeding I would like to thank my \nleader, the Senator from Nevada, for his very generous remarks. I \nappreciate that very much.\n  I rise today in support of S. 147, the Native Hawaiian Government \nReorganization Act and to address the outrageous mischaracterizations \nthat some of my colleagues made yesterday about this measure. The law \ndoes not support their attempts to discriminate against Native \nHawaiians so my colleagues had to resort to trying to confuse the \nissue.\n  This measure does not result in race discrimination. But \ndiscrimination will occur if this measure is not passed. It is \nundisputed that Native Hawaiians are the aboriginal, indigenous people \nof Hawaii. Yet some of my colleagues want to discriminate against them \nand treat them differently from other Native Americans--the American \nIndian and the Alaska Native. They seek to impose a new requirement for \nCongressional legislation to authorize the reorganization of a Native \nHawaiian government even though many of these opponents have been in \nCongress for years and did not impose this requirement on the other \naboriginal indigenous people recognized by Congress since 1978. Do not \nparticipate in these discriminatory activities.\n  Congress has plenary authority over the aboriginal, indigenous people \nof America. The Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld this. The Supreme \nCourt has also acknowledged Congress' authority to recognize as an \nIndian tribe the aboriginal, indigenous people of America regardless of \nwhether they are Indians, regardless of whether they are organized as a \ntribe, and regardless of whether they are located in territory of the \nUnited States. My colleagues who spoke against this measure yesterday \nknow this. But none of them attempted to address these issues.\n  Rather, they are trying to distract us and the American people by \nclaiming that this bill will strip Native Hawaiians of their American \ncitizenship. My colleagues know better than this. They know that Indian \ntribes, however they are formed, are recognized as sovereign \ngovernments in the United States. They know that since the early 1800s \nthe Supreme Court has called the Native governments of this land--\ndomestic, dependent nations. They know that the status and existence of \nNative governments is recognized within our form of government. But \nthey are relying on the fact that many of our citizens are not familiar \nwith Native American governments so that they incite fear of racial \npreference, denial of rights, and secession.\n  Although the United States of America does not recognize dual \ncitizenship for those who come from other countries, the United States \ndoes recognize that Native Americans can be both citizens of the United \nStates and members of their Native government. This is true even for \nthose Native Americans located in the lower 48, whose\n\n[[Page S5638]]\n\ntribal governments were terminated in the 1950s, or whose tribal \ngovernments were restored or recognized over the last 30 or so years. \nThis bill will lead to a similar situation for the Native Hawaiians. It \nis not inconsistent with what already exists in the United States.\n  Native Hawaiians do live as separate and distinct communities. In \n1921, Congress enacted the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act of 1920, which \nset aside approximately 203,500 acres of land for homesteading and \nagricultural use by Native Hawaiians. The Act was intended to \n``rehabilitate'' the Native Hawaiian race, which was estimated to have \ndropped from between 400,000 and 1 million, to 38,000. At the time, \nprevailing Federal Indian policy was premised upon the objective of \nbreaking up Indian reservations and allotting lands to individual \nIndians. Most of the homestead communities belong to an organization \ncalled the State Council of Hawaiian Homestead Associations. The \nCouncil is composed of 24 separate Native Hawaiian Homestead \nAssociations. These associations are distinct and separate communities \nof Native Hawaiians.\n  Aside from living on Hawaiian homelands, there are communities that \nare distinctly Native Hawaiian. Through Native Hawaiian social and \npolitical institutions such as the Royal Hawaiian societies which \nexisted during the Kingdom of Hawaii as well as the Association of \nHawaiian Civic Clubs, Kamehameha Schools, and Queen Liliuokalani \nChildren's Center, the Native Hawaiian community has maintained its \ndistinct character as an aboriginal, native people.\n\n  Native Hawaiian culture, tradition, custom, and language has \nexperienced a renaissance in the past 30 years. Many Native Hawaiians \nspeak the Hawaiian language and practice the cultural practices of our \nkupuna, our ancestors, in health care and in education.\n  In another attempt to incite fear of this bill, some of my colleagues \nstated that this measure would lead to Hawaii seceding from the United \nStates. Yes, a small percentage of my constituents advocate for \nIndependence from the United States. It is an extreme view that I do \nnot share, that the majority of Hawaii's citizens do not share, and \nthat will not happen.\n  In 1959, Hawaii was admitted to become a part of the United States \nbecause the voters in the territory of Hawaii overwhelmingly voted to \ndo so. This does not, however, erase the wrongs that were committed \nagainst this unique group of indigenous aboriginal native people. This \nbill does not affect Hawaii's statehood or the rights of it citizens \nunder such statehood. This measure does, however, provide an \nopportunity to reorganize a Native Hawaiian government, similar to that \nof Alaska Native and American Indians, who are also American citizens, \nand it provides an opportunity to finally resolve longstanding issues \nthat exist in Hawaii as a result of the illegal overthrow.\n  The United States, in enacting Public Law 103-150, the Apology \nResolution, has already recognized the fact that Native Hawaiians have \nnever given up their inherent sovereignty. Despite the fact that Hawaii \nwas admitted as the 50th State of the Union, Native Hawaiians neither \nby the government or through a plebiscite or referendum gave up their \nrights to inherent sovereignty. The June 27, 1959, statehood plebiscite \nin Hawaii only asked ``Shall Hawaii immediately be admitted to the \nUnion as a State?'' Although the statehood plebiscite did not provide \nother options for independence or free association, it did not dissolve \nan inherent right to sovereignty by the indigenous people of Hawaii, \nNative Hawaiians.\n  Native Hawaiians are Americans and will continue to be American \ncitizens upon enactment of this measure. Like other Native Americans, \nNative Hawaiians have honorably and overwhelmingly served in the United \nStates military. Like their Native American brethren, they have served \nin numerous wars, including, World War II, Vietnam, Afghanistan, and \nIraq and remain truly essential to protecting our country. Native \nHawaiians will continue to do so after enactment of this measure. \nNative Hawaiians are truly proud to be Americans and should be.\n  Yesterday, some implied that this measure would abridge the right to \nvote and there was an attempt to somehow link the Supreme Court's \ndecision in Rice v. Cayetano to this matter. This holding of this case \nhas no bearing on the measure before us and this bill does not reverse \nthe Court's holding. In order to fully understand what this decision \ndid and did not say, one needs to know the facts:\n  The Office of Hawaiian Affairs is established pursuant to the Hawaii \nState Constitution as a State agency to administer programs for the \nbenefit of Native Hawaiians. Prior to the Rice decision, the State \nlimited voting for the trustees of the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, to \nNative Hawaiians. Mr. Rice, a non-Native Hawaiian citizen of the State \nof Hawaii, sued the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, a State agency, because \nhe was not eligible to vote in the elections for the Board of Trustees \nthat administers programs for the benefit of Native Hawaiians. Because \nthe Office of Hawaiian Affairs is an arm of the State, the Supreme \nCourt held that the State of Hawaii's denial of the right to vote in \nelections for the Board of Trustees of the Office of Hawaiian Affairs \nviolated the Fifteenth Amendment guarantee of the right to vote.\n  That is what the Rice v. Cayetano decision held. Nothing more, \nnothing less.\n  But it appears that many of my colleagues have not read Rice. So I \nwill take the liberty to cite from the decision so that my colleagues \ncan fully understand that this case has no bearing on the matter before \nus today. Because with respect to whether or not Congress may treat \nNative Hawaiians as it does Indian tribes, the Court left open the \npossibility that Congress could treat Native Hawaiians as such. At 528 \nU.S. 518, the Court accurately noted that it had not yet considered \nwhether ``Congress . . . has determined that native Hawaiians have a \nstatus like that of organized Indian tribes. . . .'' but the Court \ncontinued by specifically stating on page 519, ``We can stay far off \nthat difficult terrain.'' The Court found it unnecessary to address \nwhether Congress has treated Native Hawaiians as an Indian tribe \nbecause it found that the Office of Hawaiian Affairs is a State agency.\n\n  Although the holding of Rice is not relevant to the matter before us, \nthe author of the State's brief is interesting, for the author is none \nother than recently confirmed Chief Justice John Roberts. Now Chief \nJustice Roberts clearly laid out the arguments as to how and why Native \nHawaiians are a separate and distinct aboriginal, indigenous people who \nfall within Congress's plenary authority over Indian tribes. For \ninstance, Chief Justice Roberts stated:\n\n       Congress's broad authority over Indian affairs reaches the \n     shores of Hawaii, too.\n       The Constitution gives Congress--not the courts--authority \n     to acknowledge and extinguish claims based on aboriginal \n     status.\n       Congress has established with Hawaiians the same type of \n     `unique legal relationship' that exists with respect to the \n     Indian tribes who enjoy the `same rights and privileges' \n     accorded Hawaiians. . . .\n\n  I urge all of my colleagues to read the excellent brief drafted by \nnow Chief Justice Roberts.\n  Congress has repeatedly enacted laws that limit the right to vote in \nNative governmental elections to the members of that native government \nand it is consistent with the Constitution. In the 1930's, Congress \nenacted the Indian Reorganization Act and limited voting to tribal \nmembers. In the 1970's, Congress enacted the Alaska Native Claims \nSettlement Act and limited voting to Native shareholders and their \ndescendants. Since 1978, Congress has enacted over 20 laws that \nauthorized the reorganization or recognition of Indian tribes and many \nof those laws expressly limit voting to the members of those tribes. To \nlisten to the opponents of this measure, the bill will create a racial \npreference for voting in a native government and that this has never \nbeen done before. But as I just pointed out, this bill is not forging \nnew ground. This bill is consistent with Congress's past actions and \nthe Supreme Court has never questioned these actions.\n  Another matter that my colleagues try to confuse others on is the \ndifference between reorganizing or recognizing a native government and \ncreating a native government. No one, not even the opponents of the \nmeasure, dispute that Native Hawaiians exercised sovereignty over the \nlands that now\n\n[[Page S5639]]\n\ncomprise Hawaii before European contact. No one disputes that there was \na Native Hawaiian Kingdom. Consequently, there was a Native Hawaiian \ngovernment that the United States recognized as a sovereign. Indeed, \nthe United States even engaged in government-to-government relations \nwith the Kingdom of Hawaii. It is this government which will be \nreorganized as a domestic, dependent nation within our constitutional \nframework, in a manner consistent with the status of other Native \nAmericans.\n  To hear the comments made yesterday, one would think that there was \nnever a Native Hawaiian government. One of my colleagues recently \nattended a forum on this measure and mentioned his concern over the \nlack of civic education in America and the corresponding lack of \nknowledge about America's history. I agree with him. I urge all my \ncolleagues to learn more about the history of Hawaii, the history of \nNative Hawaiians, the history of the United States, the laws enacted by \nCongress for the benefit of the aboriginal, indigenous people of the \nUnited States, and the laws handed down by the Supreme Court.\n  I am confident that once my colleagues become more informed about \nthese matters, all will realize that enacting legislation authorizing \nthe reorganization of a native government is within Congress authority. \nThe Supreme Court reaffirmed this authority as recently as 2 years ago \nin United States v. Lara. In fact, the Court acknowledged that \n``Congress has restored previously extinguished tribal status--by re-\nrecognizing a Tribe whose tribal existence it previously had \nterminated.''\n\n  Once everyone obtains more education about the history and laws \ninfluencing this measure, they will realize that various history \nimpacts the history of the United States, you will realize the \ndifference between authorizing the reorganization of a native \ngovernment and creating one out of thin air.\n  Claims that this bill will establish a precedent for the recognition \nof tribal status for Amish or Hassidic Jews or other groups are \nridiculous. It is just another attempt to scare the citizens of \nAmerica. Congress has the authority to recognize government-to-\ngovernment relations with the aboriginal, indigenous people because of \ntheir preexisting sovereignty over the lands because of European \ncontact. None of these other groups are preexisting sovereigns who \nexercised such authority.\n  Nor will this result in a government for the Hispanics who lived in \nTexas before it became a republic in 1836, or for descendants of the \nFrench citizens before the Louisiana Purchase. Again, these citizens \nare not aboriginal, indigenous people who exercised sovereignty before \nWestern contact. While Congress has used its plenary authority to \nrecognize the aboriginal, indigenous people who reside in these former \nterritories, Congress has never attempted to recognize the non-\naboriginal, non-indigenous people as a government nor will it. We are \nnot creating a precedent here.\n  Finally, I want to address the letter from the Department of Justice \nthat was sent to Majority Leader Frist last night. Last year, the \nJustice Department sent a longer letter outlining substantive policy \nconcerns. Senator Akaka and I, along with Governor Lingle, engaged in \nextensive negotiations with administration officials to address these \nsubstantive policy concerns. The result of these negotiations are \ncontained in the substitute amendment that Senator Akaka will he \noffering. There was no attempt to address the ideological concerns laid \nout in that letter. Therefore, Senator Akaka and I have always known \nthat all of the Department of Justice's concerns will not be addressed \nin the substitute amendment.\n  Before anyone relies too much on the Justice Department's letter, let \nme point out that the letter cites to the United States Commission on \nCivil Rights. I urge everyone to read the Government Accountability \nOffice report released last week that noted the Commission's recent \nactivities are not objective nor are there procedures in place to \nguarantee that they are.\n  While the letter correctly notes that the Supreme Court believes \nthere is considerable dispute, it fails to acknowledge that the Supreme \nCourt could have addressed the issue in Rice v. Cayetano but instead \nchose to put the issue aside for another day. The letter also does not \nmention the extensive Supreme Court case law that recognizes that it is \nCongress who has the authority to recognize a government-to-government \nrelationship with a native government, not the Courts.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on cloture so that this matter \ncan be fully debated and everyone can be informed of the law supporting \nthis measure. Do not fall victim to attempts to confuse this issue \nbefore us. Do not let your arm be twisted with threats that you should \nignore your constituents and vote for the party line that is based on \nmisinformation, not the law. All we are asking is that you allow an up \nor down vote on this measure.\n  Recently, the President of the United States George W. Bush submitted \nthe name of John Roberts to be Chief Justice of the United States. \nChief Justice Roberts was confirmed by this body because of his \nintellectual background and primarily because of his conservative \nviews.\n  Recently, Chief Justice Roberts laid out arguments as to how and why \nNative Hawaiians are a separate and distinct aboriginal indigenous \npeople who fall within Congress's plenary authority over Indian tribes. \nAmong the many things that the Chief Justice said in his brief is the \nfollowing:\n\n       Congress' broad authority over Indian affairs that reaches \n     the shores of Hawaii too.\n\n  He went further to say:\n\n       The Constitution gives Congress--not the courts--authority \n     to acknowledge and extinguish claims based on aboriginal \n     status.\n\n  Chief Justice Roberts further stated:\n\n       Congress has established with Hawaiians the same type of \n     ``unique legal relationships'' that exist with respect to the \n     Indian tribes who enjoy the ``same rights and privileges'' \n     accorded Hawaiians . . .\n\n  I urge all of my colleagues to read this excellent brief by now Chief \nJustice Roberts.\n  Mr. President, many things have been said about what this bill will \ndo and will not do. Some were rather outrageous, I must say. For \nexample, it was argued that this bill will establish a precedent for \nthe recognition of tribal status for Amish and Hasidic Jews or other \ngroups.\n  I think it is just another attempt to scare our fellow Americans.\n  Congress has the authority to recognize government-to- government \nrelations with aboriginal indigenous people because of their \npreexisting sovereignty over lands before European contact. None of the \ngroups that have been named, such as the Amish or the Hasidic Jews, are \npreexisting sovereigns who exercised such authority.\n  While Congress has used plenary authority to recognize aboriginal \nindigenous people who reside in these former territories, Congress has \nnever attempted to recognize the nonaboriginal nonindigenous people as \na government, and it will not. We are not creating any precedent here.\n  Finally, the letter from the Department of Justice was mentioned. It \nwas sent to our majority leader last evening.\n  Last year, the Justice Department sent a longer letter outlining \nsubstantive policy concerns. As a result of that letter, Senator Akaka \nand I, together with Governor Lingle, the Republican Governor of \nHawaii, engaged in extensive negotiations and discussions for nearly 2 \nmonths with officials of the White House, the Justice Department, and \nOMB to address these policy concerns.\n  The result of these negotiations was contained in a substitute \namendment identified as S. 364, which was introduced by Senator Akaka. \nHe made a formal request that this bill be considered original text for \nconsideration in this debate. Regretfully, that offer was rejected.\n  This letter from the Attorney General does not refer to S. 364, which \nthey are well aware of because they helped us draft it. They refer to \nthe old bill, S. 147, which we intend to substitute with S. 364.\n  Yes, we are aware of the shortcomings of S. 147, and we met for \nnearly 2 months to clarify that.\n  I hope my colleagues will vote yes on this cloture motion so this \nmatter can be more fully debated and everyone can\n\n[[Page S5640]]\n\nbe fully informed of the laws supporting the measure.\n  All we are asking for is an up-or-down vote on this measure. We just \nwant an opportunity to debate this measure.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee has 2 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, there is a fundamental shortcoming to \nthis bill that can't be corrected by small amendments. There is no \nquestion that this legislation would--and I believe for the first time \nin our history--create a new, separate, independent race-based \ngovernment within the borders of the United States of America. The only \nargument that could possibly justify such an offense to our \nconstitutional tradition and our original motto, which says that when \nwe became Americans we are proud of where we came from but we are \nprouder of being Americans, is that Native Hawaiians are just another \nIndian tribe. But the government of Hawaii itself, in a brief in the \nSupreme Court in 1998, said: ``The tribal concept simply has no place \nin the context of Hawaiian history.''\n  The Department of Justice, in a letter yesterday to the majority \nleader, with a copy to the minority leader, said: ``Tribal recognition \nis inappropriate for native Hawaiians and would still raise difficult \nconstitutional issues.''\n  I have outlined in my remarks how Native Hawaiians do not constitute \njust another tribe. There may be wrongs to address, but this is the \nwrong way to right a wrong.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider en bloc the following \nnominations, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nominations of Noel Lawrence Hillman, \nof New Jersey, to be United States District Judge for the District of \nNew Jersey; Peter G. Sheridan, of New Jersey, to be United States \nDistrict Judge for the District of New Jersey; Thomas L. Ludington, of \nMichigan, to be United States District Judge for the Eastern District \nof Michigan; Sean F. Cox, of Michigan, to be United States District \nJudge for the Eastern District of Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Debate on these nominations shall be allocated \nas follows: Mr. Lautenberg, 10 minutes; Mr. Menendez, 10 minutes; Ms. \nStabenow, 10 minutes; Mr. Specter, 10 minutes; and Mr. Leahy, 10 \nminutes.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to use 1 minute of \nthe time allocated to Senator Leahy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the Senate will be \nvoting today on two Michigan jurists, Tom Ludington and Sean Cox, whom \nthe President has nominated to the Federal bench for the Eastern \nDistrict of Michigan. Both of these jurists received unanimously ``well \nqualified'' ratings from the American Bar Association to serve as \nFederal district judges. We are fortunate that we have jurists such as \nJudge Ludington and Judge Cox devoted to public service. I believe both \nwill bring character and judicial temperament and integrity to the \nEastern District of Michigan. I congratulate these jurists and their \nfamilies on their nominations. I urge the Senate to confirm them.\n  Thomas Ludington is currently chief judge on the Circuit Court for \nMidland\n\n[[Page S5641]]\n\nCounty in Midland, MI. He received his J.D. from the University of San \nDiego School of Law in 1979 and his B.A. from Albion College in 1976, \nwhere he graduated cum laude.\n  After graduating from law school, Judge Ludington worked as an \nassociate and then as a shareholder-partner at a private law firm. At \nthat firm, Judge Ludington's practice covered a range of commercial \nissues, including banking, securities, bankruptcy, the uniform \ncommercial code, and employment law. He served as president of the firm \nfor 6 years.\n  In 1995, Judge Ludington was elected to a 6-year term on the 42nd \nCircuit Court of Michigan. In 1999, he was appointed to the position of \nchief judge, in which he as served with distinction.\n  Judge Ludington is a member of several State and local bar \nassociations and belongs to numerous professional and community \norganizations. For example, since assuming the bench, he has helped \norganize the Midland Alliance for Justice, a foundation for the local \nbar association that provides legal representation to indigent parties.\n  The American Bar Association rated Judge Ludington unanimously ``well \nqualified'' to serve as a Federal judge.\n  Sean Cox earned his B.A. from the University of Michigan and his J.D. \nfrom the Detroit College of Law in May 1983. In his 20-year legal \ncareer, Judge Cox has had experience in both private practice and on \nthe bench. Judge Cox began practicing law in April 1984 as an associate \nattorney with a private law firm and worked for 12 years in the areas \nof medical malpractice, products liability, and complex litigation.\n  Cox left private practice in March 1996 to serve as judge of the \nCircuit Court for the Third Judicial Circuit in Wayne County, MI. Judge \nCox has also served in various professional organizations and has \nfrequently provided free legal services through a legal aid clinic his \nlaw firm established at St. Anne's Catholic Church in Detroit.\n  The American Bar Association has also rated Judge Cox Unanimously \n``well qualified'' to serve as a Federal judge.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I endorse the nominations of the \npeople under consideration, Noel Hillman and Peter Sheridan, to be \nFederal judges on the U.S. District Court of New Jersey. Both of these \ncandidates are outstanding attorneys and are well qualified to assume \nthe position on the bench.\n  The Senate has recently confirmed two nominees for this court--Judge \nSusan Wigenton and Renee Bumb. Today I hope this body will resoundingly \napprove these two additional nominees for the District of New Jersey.\n  Noel Hillman recently served as the Chief of the Public Integrity \nSection at the Department of Justice, leading a team of 30 attorneys \nwho investigate and prosecute public corruption cases nationwide.\n  Mr. Hillman has a reputation for taking on crimes that undermine \npublic confidence in our political system--no matter how political or \ncontroversial. He steps up to the task and does it well.\n  Before he went to the Justice Department, Mr. Hillman served as \nDeputy Chief of the Criminal Division of the U.S. Attorney's Office in \nNew Jersey and as Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Fraud and Public \nProtection Division.\n  His work has not escaped recognition. He received the Attorney \nGeneral's Award for Fraud Prevention in 2004, the Executive Office of \nU.S. Attorneys Director's Award in 1996 and 1999, and the Department of \nJustice Superior Performance Award in 1997.\n  I am also proud to note that Mr. Hillman was educated in New Jersey, \ngraduating from Monmouth College and Seton Hall Law School.\n  Mr. President, Peter Sheridan has also been nominated for the \nDistrict Court of New Jersey, and his resume shows his vast legal \nexperience and knowledge.\n  Like Mr. Hillman, Peter Sheridan is the product of a New Jersey \neducation. Mr. Sheridan also graduated from Seton Hall Law School, as \nwell as receiving his undergraduate degree from St. Peter's College.\n  Both of these people know New Jersey well and are part of the culture \nand character of New Jersey. We are delighted that they are going to \naccede to the bench if approved here, as we expect.\n  Mr. Sheridan has spent the last decade as a named partner at Graham, \nCurtin & Sheridan in Trenton, NJ. Prior to that he worked in private \npractice at other law firms, and has a strong record of public service.\n  He served as director of the Authorities Unit for the State of New \nJersey, vice president and general counsel of the Atlantic City Casino \nAssociation, and an attorney with the Port Authority of New York and \nNew Jersey.\n  Mr. President, I note that if the Senate approves these two nominees, \nthen this year alone we will have confirmed New Jersey nominees for the \nSupreme Court, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, and the District \nCourt of New Jersey.\n  I hope the good working relationship that allowed this accomplishment \nwill continue for the remaining vacancy on the Third Circuit Court of \nAppeals and for future nominations.\n  I had the honor of introducing Mr. Hillman and Mr. Sheridan to the \nJudiciary Committee, and today I am proud to endorse their \nconfirmation. I urge my colleagues to support them as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Menendez, is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nnominations of Peter G. Sheridan and Noel Lawrence Hillman to serve as \nUnited States District Judges for the District of New Jersey.\n  The confirmation of a judge to a lifetime appointment is a vital \nresponsibility given to this body by the Constitution, and one that I \ntake very seriously.\n  That is why I am pleased that our final two nominees from the package \nof four from New Jersey have come before the Senate today. Each of the \nfour was favorably reported by the Judiciary Committee back in April. \nTheir confirmation would be a testament to the cooperation and \ncollaborative effort between the Senators from New Jersey, the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, and the White House.\n  When we work together to select qualified, independent, and diverse \njudges, we can fill these positions expeditiously and work in a \nbipartisan manner that benefits not only the State of New Jersey, but \nalso our Nation.\n  Both nominees before us today are graduates of Seton Hall School of \nLaw in Newark, NJ, and both possess undergraduate degrees from our \nshared State.\n  Mr. Sheridan attended my own alma mater, St. Peter's College, and was \nhonored as Alumnus of the Year in 2003, an honor that I'm still hoping \nto receive one day. He has been in private practice with Graham, \nCurtin, and Sheridan for the past 11 years and is currently a \nshareholder and director of the firm. Mr. Sheridan is an experienced \ntrial lawyer, appearing on numerous occasions before the very court to \nwhich he is now nominated. I am confident that his years of experience \nbefore State and Federal courts will serve him well on the Federal \nbench.\n  The final nominee in our package is Noel Lawrence Hillman. Mr. \nHillman is a graduate, cum laude, from Monmouth University in Long \nBranch, NJ. In addition to his law degree, he also has a masters in law \nfrom New York University. Mr. Hillman served as an Assistant U. S. \nAttorney for nearly a decade before becoming Deputy Chief of the \nCriminal Division.\n  Most recently, he worked as the Chief of the Public Integrity Section \nat the U.S. Department of Justice, where he spearheaded the \nGovernment's case against Jack Abramoff. Mr. Hillman has twice received \nthe Director's Award, the highest award given to an assistant U.S. \nattorney, and in 2004 received the Attorney General's Award for Fraud \nPrevention. The American Bar Association has rated Mr. Hillman as \n``well qualified'' for this position and I must concur with that \nassessment.\n  There truly is no higher calling than the calling of public service. \nThat is why I am so pleased to see people of this quality who are \nwilling to serve our Nation in the administration of justice.\n\n[[Page S5642]]\n\n  I must thank the chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary \nCommittee for moving these nominees through the process so fairly and \nquickly. I hope the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey \ncan serve as an example of bipartisanship and cooperation in getting \nmutually agreed upon judges confirmed without dispute. I look forward \nto each of our four nominees serving on the Federal bench and know that \nthey will make our State proud.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the nominations of \nPeter Sheridan and Noel Lawrence Hillman to serve on the U.S. District \nCourt for the District of New Jersey.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business and have this time counted toward the requirements for \nthe executive session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              The Internet\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, tomorrow in the other body, the House of \nRepresentatives, they will begin debating one of the most important \ncommunications issues facing our country--the future of the Internet.\n  Since the other body will begin that discussion shortly and we have \nhad debate beginning in the Senate Commerce Committee, chaired by \nSenator Stevens who worked so cooperatively with Senator Inouye, I wish \nto take a few minutes and talk about why I think this issue is so \nimportant and what the stakes are for our country.\n  We all understand what has been so exciting about the Internet. The \nInternet has been a tremendously democratizing force, ensuring that in \nevery nook and cranny of America, opportunities are there for Americans \nto learn, to tap the free enterprise system and to secure health care \nto name a few. This is an extraordinary array of opportunities.\n  Today on the Internet, after you have paid your access charge to use \nthe Net, you go where you want, when you want, how you want, free of \ndiscrimination because you have paid that one original access charge.\n  Unfortunately, there are huge communications lobbies, consisting \nparticularly of some of the major phone companies and some of the major \ncable companies, that want to change the way the Internet works. They \nwould like to make consumers and businesses in our country pay tomorrow \nfor what is free today.\n  Today, when small businesses or consumers pay their Internet access \ncharge, they can go wherever they want, whenever they want, however \nthey want, without racking up extra charges and without facing \ndiscrimination. Unfortunately, these big communications lobbies would \nlike to change that. For example, we see reports in distinguished \nbusiness publications, such as the Wall Street Journal. They talk there \nabout communications plans that are ``pay to play.'' If you were going \nto go to a variety of Web sites, under the approach they are proposing \nin the Wall Street Journal, the Web sites or the consumer would have to \npay every time they went to one of these Web sites, in order to get \ngood quality service.\n  I don't think that is right. I think that is discrimination. I think \nit is discriminating against consumers, I think it is discriminating \nagainst small businesses. I think it will do extraordinary damage to \nthe inherent beauty of the Internet, which has been all about a fair \nshake for every American, for every consumer.\n  In an effort to spin this discrimination by the big cable companies \nand big phone companies against the consumers, the big lobbies are \nengaged in a huge advertising blitz. By my back-of-the-envelope \ncalculations, these big lobbies are spending hundreds of millions of \ndollars on advertisements to convince the American people that \ndiscrimination and these extra charges they would face on the Internet \nare actually good for consumers and businesses.\n  If it is so good for the consumer, why are these lobbies spending \nmillions of dollars on these advertisements to tell the American people \nabout it? If discrimination was so good, wouldn't consumers have been \ninterested in paying higher prices a long time ago?\n  It is hard to open the pages of a newspaper or turn on the television \nwithout seeing an advertisement urging people to stop Congress from \n``regulating the Internet.'' One trade association has even placed ads \nin the airports around Washington, DC, hoping Senators and \nRepresentatives traveling back to their States will see them. I can't \nimagine the executives of these large corporations would commit such \nlarge sums to advertising if they didn't think these kinds of \nadvertisements would pay off handsomely in profits.\n  Groups, such as Hands Off the Internet, a front group for some of the \nbig communications lobbies, have offered some eye-popping ads. Look at \nthis recent ad, for example, in which they display a copy of my \nlegislation, the Internet Nondiscrimination Act. The only thing \naccurate about this ad is the top page of my bill. It has my name on \nit. It clearly says the ``Internet Nondiscrimination Act,'' but just \nabout everything else is dead wrong. What they have done is falsely add \nwhat looks like hundreds, if not thousands, of pages to my bill. This \nis how they demonstrate what my legislation is all about. Here is the \nreality, Mr. President. Here is what they say I propose. However, this \nis just not accurate. Here is what my legislation looks like, what the \nbig communications lobbies ought to describe as the real world; a piece \nof legislation that is 15 pages long.\n  The bill I have introduced, this 15-page bill, doesn't look like \nanything along the lines of what the big communications lobbies are \nspending such vast sums on saying it looks like.\n  There is an even more disturbing misrepresentation in this ad. It \nsays, stamped up at the top, ``regulation.'' My legislation isn't about \nregulation. All I want is to leave the Internet alone. I don't want it \nto be subject to discriminatory changes, changes that would hit the \nAmerican consumer in the pocket.\n  I think any fairminded American who looks at my record will see that \nI have never sought to regulate the Internet. On the contrary, when I \ncame to the Senate, I was a leader in the effort to keep the Internet \nfree of discriminatory taxes. I fought to keep the Internet free of \nregulation. Now I am trying to keep control of the Internet in the \nhands of the American people and not force Americans in this country to \npay tomorrow for what is free today.\n  If you looked at these advertisements, Mr. President, you would think \nthat neutrality is some newfangled idea that threatens the Internet. \nNet neutrality is what we have today, and the Internet has thrived \nprecisely because it is neutral. It has thrived because consumers, and \nnot some huge phone company or some huge cable company, get to choose \nwhat they want to see and how quickly they get to see it.\n\n  I want to make it clear that those of us who are fighting to keep the \nNet neutral, which means that when you go to your browser, you go where \nyou want, when you want, how you want, after you pay that initial \naccess charge, are not interested in regulating anything. The people \nwho want to make the changes, the big telecom and cable lobbies, are \nthe ones who want to meddle with the Internet. They want to put their \nhands on the Internet so they can heap all these extra charges on the \nAmerican people.\n  Right now there is a small business, a craft maker, in Tigard, OR, \nwho has a Web site where she sells her products all over the world. If \nthese big lobbies have their way, she will have to pay a new hefty fee \nso customers can continue to have the same access to her Web site. That \nis not right. The consumer, after they pay that initial access charge, \nought to be able to go where they want, when they want, how they want \nto get there. To make them pay tomorrow for what they get for free \ntoday is wrong.\n  Colleagues are waiting to speak. I had anticipated spending a bit \nmore time on this, but I think this ad says it all. We ought to keep \nthe Internet free\n\n[[Page S5643]]\n\nof discrimination. We ought to protect consumers against multiple and \ndiscriminatory access charges. The next time somebody sees one of these \nads, ads that seem to have millions of dollars of lobby money backing \nthem up, they ought to know that this which purports to represent my \nlegislation is false. What is in this ad suggests scores and scores of \npages. The reality is my bill to keep the Internet free of \ndiscrimination and protect the consumer is 15 pages long.\n  This argument at the top of the ad that there will be a host of Net-\nneutrality regulations is similarly false. It is not about regulating \nanything on the Internet. I want to keep the Internet the way it is--an \nopen, vibrant system, accessible to all.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to speak to the nominations \nbefore us. I appreciate my distinguished colleague and friend from \nOregon relinquishing the floor. He is very passionate and such a \nwonderful leader on so many topics. I appreciate his good work.\n  I rise today to support the nominations of Judge Sean Cox and Judge \nThomas Ludington to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of \nMichigan. Both nominees will bring distinguished legal careers and \njudicial experience to the Federal bench.\n  Judge Sean Cox has served as a Circuit Court Judge for the Third \nCircuit of Michigan since 1996. He is a graduate of the Detroit College \nof Law at the University of Michigan and has over 12 years of private \npractice experience.\n  Judge Thomas Ludington has served on the 42nd Circuit Court for \nMidland County since 1995. He has served as chief judge of this court \nfor the past 6 years.\n  Judge Ludington is a graduate of the University of San Diego School \nof Law and Albion College. After graduating from law school, Judge \nLudington worked at Currie and Kendall law firm for 14 years. He also \nserved as president of the firm before he left to join the Michigan \ncircuit bench.\n  I thank Senator Specter and Senator Leahy for working with me and \nSenator Levin to bring these two truly qualified nominees to the floor \nof the Senate. I look forward to continuing to work with them on issues \nrelated to the Michigan District Court and the Sixth Circuit Court of \nAppeals. I urge my colleagues to join with us in strongly supporting \nthe nominations and confirming Judge Cox and Judge Ludington.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the votes on the \nconfirmation of judges begin at 2 p.m. today; provided further, that \nall the votes in the sequence after the first be limited to 10 minutes \neach.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The hour of 2 p.m. having arrived, the \nquestion is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination of \nNoel Lawrence Hillman, of New Jersey, to be United States District \nJudge for the District of New Jersey?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in \norder to ask for the yeas and nays on all four of the nominees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. STABENOW. I ask for the yeas and nays, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I wish to speak briefly--for less than 2 \nminutes--on the four nominees.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the previously \nordered rollcalls on the next two nominees be vitiated, they be \nconsidered and passed en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent en bloc to the \nnominations of Thomas L. Ludington, of Michigan, to be United States \nDistrict Judge for the Eastern District of Michigan and Sean F. Cox, of \nMichigan, to be United States District Judge for the Eastern District \nof Michigan.\n  The nominations were confirmed en bloc.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today the Senate confirmed four lifetime \nappointments to U.S. district courts, Noel Hillman and Peter Sheridan, \nwho have been nominated to seats on the U.S. District Court for the \nDistrict of New Jersey, and Thomas Ludington and Sean Cox, who have \nbeen nominated to seats on the U.S. District Court for the Eastern \nDistrict of Michigan. They are all nominees who have the support of \nDemocratic home State Senators.\n  I am glad the Republican leadership has taken notice of the fact \nthat, as I discussed earlier this week, these nominees have been ready \nfor action for some time, since being reported unanimously last month. \nI also look forward to working with the Republican leadership to \nschedule debate and consideration of Sandra Segal Ikuta, who has been \nnominated to a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, \nand Andrew Guilford to be a district judge for the Central District of \nCalifornia who also have the support of Democratic home State Senators \nand could also be easily confirmed. When they are considered, and I \nhope the Republican leadership will agree to do that next week and not \ndelay, we will have confirmed 250 of President Bush's nominees to \nlifetime appointments on the Federal courts.\n  As I noted earlier this week, the nominees we are considering today \ncould have been confirmed earlier if the Republican leadership had \nchosen to proceed with them instead of pressing forward first with the \ncontroversial nomination of Brett Kavanaugh and the divisive debate \nover a constitutional amendment that had no chance of passing. I do \ncommend the Republican Senate leadership for wisely passing over the \ncontroversial nominations of William Gerry Myers III, Terrence W. \nBoyle, and Norman Randy Smith to turn to these nominations today. In \nthe course of an hour or two this week, the Senate will confirm five \nlifetime appointments to the Federal courts. Debate on those flawed \nnominations will take much longer. The Republican leadership is right \nto have avoided such controversial nominations that were only reported \non a party-line vote.\n  During the 17 months I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee and \nthe Senate was under Democratic control, we confirmed 100 of President \nBush's nominees. After today, in the last 17 months under Republican \ncontrol, the Senate will have confirmed 43.\n  Regrettably, rather than fill judicial vacancies with qualified \nnominees, the Republican leadership seems all too often more focused on \npicking fights. Last month, they forced debate on the controversial \nnomination of a White House insider selected for a lifetime position on \nthe DC Circuit as a reward for his loyalty to President Bush. I did not \nsupport confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh. That was the fight the \nRepublican leader had promised the narrow special interest groups of \nthe rightwing of his party.\n  The President and Senate Republican leadership continue to pick \nfights over judicial nominations rather than focus on filing vacancies. \nThis is part of their partisan effort to agitate conservative voters, \nno doubt. They are willing to play politics with the Constitution and \nwith the courts. They treat the Constitution as a billboard for \ncampaign posters and political ads.\n  Judicial vacancies have now grown to nearly 50 from the lowest \nvacancy rate in decades. More than half these vacancies are without a \nnominee. The Congressional Research Service has recently released a \nstudy showing that this President has been the slowest in decades to \nmake circuit court nominations and the Republican Senate among the \nslowest to act. If they would concentrate on the needs of the courts, \nour Federal justice system, and the needs of the American people, we \nwould be much further along.\n  This week we passed a milestone, confirming the 17th judicial nominee \nthis session. That was the total number of judges confirmed in the 1996 \ncongressional session, when Republicans controlled the Senate and \nstalled the nominations of President Clinton. In the 1996 session, \nhowever, Republicans would not confirm a single appellate court judge. \nAll 17 confirmations were district court nominees. That is the only \nsession I can remember in which the Senate has simply refused to \nconsider a single appellate court nomination. That was part of their \npocket-filibuster strategy to stall and maintain vacancies so that a \nRepublican President could pack the courts and tilt them decidedly to \nthe right. In the important DC Circuit, the confirmation of Brett \nKavanaugh was the culmination of the Republicans' decade-long attempt \nto pack the DC Circuit that began with the stalling of Merrick \nGarland's nomination in 1996 and continued with the blocking of \nPresident Clinton's other well-qualified nominees, Elena Kagan and \nAllen Snyder.\n  If the Republican leadership will work with us to schedule Sandra \nSegal Ikuta's nomination for consideration and a vote, we are likely to \nadd another circuit court confirmation to that total. I only wish \nPresident Clinton's nominees had received the same treatment.\n  The road ahead is likely to be rocky. In the runup to the Kavanaugh \nnomination debate, we saw that the Senate Republican leadership is \napparently\n\n[[Page S5645]]\n\nheeding the advice of The Wall Street Journal editorial page, which \nwrote, ``[a] filibuster fight would be exactly the sort of political \nbattle Republicans need to energize conservative voters after their \nrecent months of despond.'' Rich Lowery, editor of the conservative \nNational Review, listed a fight over judges as one of the ways \nPresident Bush could revive his political fortunes, writing that he \nshould, ``[p]ush for the confirmation of his circuit judges that are \npending. Talk about them by name. The G.O.P. wins judiciary fights.''\n  Republican Senators are relishing picking fights over controversial \njudicial nominees. Senator Thune has said, ``A good fight on judges \ndoes nothing but energize our base . . . . Right now our folks are \nfeeling a little flat.'' Senator Cornyn has said, ``I think this is \nexcellent timing. From a political standpoint, when we talk about \njudges, we win.'' On May 8, 2006, The New York Times reported: \n``Republicans are itching for a good election-year fight. Now they are \nabout to get one: a reprise of last year's Senate showdown over \njudges.'' The Washington Post reported on May 10: ``Republicans had \nrevived debate on Kavanaugh and another Bush appellate nominee, \nTerrence Boyle, in hopes of changing the pre-election subject from \nIraq, high gasoline prices and bribery scandals.''\n  We should not stand idly by as Republicans choose to use lifetime \nFederal judgeships for partisan political advantage. In a May 11, 2006, \neditorial The Tennessean wrote:\n\n       [T]he nation should look with complete dismay at the \n     blatantly political angle on nominations being advocated by \n     Senate Republicans now. . . . Republicans are girding for a \n     fight on judicial nominees for no reason other than to be \n     girding for a fight. They have admitted as much in public \n     comments. . . . In other words, picking a public fight over \n     judicial nominees is, in their minds, the right thing to do \n     because it's the politically right thing to do. . . . Now, \n     Republicans are advocating a brawl for openly political \n     purposes. The appointment of judges deserves far more respect \n     than to be an admitted election-year ploy. . . . It should be \n     beneath the Senate to have such a serious matter subjected to \n     nothing but a tool for political gain.\n\n  On May 3, 2006, The New York Times wrote in an editorial: ``The \nRepublicans have long used judicial nominations as a way of placating \nthe far right of their party, and it appears that with President Bush \nsinking in the polls, they now want to offer up some new appeals court \njudges to their conservative base.''\n  Consider the President's nomination of Judge Terrence Boyle to the \nFourth Circuit. We have learned from recent news reports that, as a \nsitting U.S. district judge and while a circuit court nominee, Judge \nBoyle ruled on multiple cases involving corporations in which he held \ninvestments. In at least one instance, he is alleged to have bought \nGeneral Electric stock while presiding over a lawsuit in which General \nElectric was accused of illegally denying disability benefits to a \nlongtime employee. Two months later, he ruled in favor of GE and denied \nthe employee's claim for long-term and pension disability benefits. \nWhether or not it turns out that Judge Boyle broke Federal law or \ncanons of judicial ethics, these types of conflicts of interest have no \nplace on the Federal bench. Certainly, they should not be rewarded with \na promotion to the Fourth Circuit. Certainly, they should be \ninvestigated.\n  The President should heed the call of North Carolina Police \nBenevolent Association, the North Carolina Troopers' Association, the \nPolice Benevolent Associations from South Carolina and Virginia, the \nNational Association of Police Organizations, the Professional Fire \nFighters and Paramedics of North Carolina, as well as the advice of \nSenator Salazar and former Senator John Edwards, and withdraw his ill-\nadvised nomination of Judge Terrence Boyle. Law enforcement from North \nCarolina and law enforcement from across the country oppose the \nnomination. Civil rights groups oppose the nomination. Those \nknowledgeable and respectful of judicial ethics oppose this nomination. \nThis nomination has been pending on the calendar in the Republican-\ncontrolled Senate since June of last year when it was forced out of the \ncommittee on a party-line vote. It should be withdrawn.\n  Also on the calendar is the nomination of William Myers to the Ninth \nCircuit. This is another administration insider and lobbyist whose \nrecord has made him extremely controversial. I opposed this nomination \nwhen it was considered by the Judiciary Committee in March 2005. He was \na nominee who the so-called Gang of 14 expressly listed as someone for \nwhom they made no commitment to vote for cloture, and with good reason. \nHis antienvironmental record is reason enough to oppose his \nconfirmation. His lack of independence is another. If anyone sought to \nproceed to this nomination, there would be a need to explore his \nconnections with the lobbying scandals associated with the Interior \nDepartment and Jack Abramoff. This nomination should also be withdrawn.\n  A few months ago, the President withdrew the nomination of Judge \nJames Payne to the Court of Appeals for the tenth Circuit after \ninformation became public about that nominee's rulings in a number of \ncases in which he appears, like Judge Boyle, to have had conflicts of \ninterest. Those conflicts were pointed out not by the administration's \nscreening process or by the ABA but by journalists.\n  Judge Payne joins a long list of nominations by this President that \nhave been withdrawn. Among the more well known are Bernard Kerik to \nhead the Department of Homeland Security and Harriet Miers to the \nSupreme Court. It was, as I recall, reporting in a national magazine \nthat doomed the Kerik nomination. It was opposition within the \nPresident's own party that doomed the Miers nomination.\n  During the last few months, President Bush also withdrew the \nnominations of Judge Henry Saad to the Court of Appeals for the sixth \nCircuit and Judge Daniel P. Ryan to the Eastern District of Michigan \nafter his ABA rating was downgraded.\n  It is not as if we have not been victimized before by the White \nHouse's poor vetting of important nominations. If the White House had \nits way, we would already have confirmed Claude Allen to the Fourth \nCircuit. He is the Bush administration insider who recently resigned \nhis position as a top domestic policy adviser to the President. \nUltimately we learned why he resigned when he was arrested for \nfraudulent conduct over an extended period of time. Had we Democrats \nnot objected to the White House attempt to shift a circuit judgeship \nfrom Maryland to Virginia, someone now the subject of a criminal \nprosecution for the equivalent of stealing from retail stores would be \na sitting judge on the Fourth Circuit confirmed with a Republican \nrubberstamp.\n  Yet another controversial pending nomination is that of Norman Randy \nSmith to the Ninth Circuit. This nomination is another occasion on \nwhich this President is seeking to steal a circuit court seat from one \nState and reassign it to another one, one with Republican Senators. \nThat is wrong. I support Senators Feinstein and Boxer in their \nopposition to this tactic. I have suggested a way to resolve two \ndifficult situations if the President were to renominate Mr. Smith to \nfill the Idaho vacancy on the Ninth Circuit instead of a vacancy for a \nCalifornia seat. Regrettably, the White House has not followed up on my \nsuggestion.\n  A complicit Republican-controlled Senate remains all too eager to act \nas a rubberstamp for the Bush-Cheney administration. The nomination of \nMr. Kavanaugh was one of the few to be downgraded by the ABA upon \nfurther review. Until the Republican-controlled Senate proceeded to \nconfirm this White House insider, I cannot recall anyone being \nconfirmed after such a development--another first, and another \nproblematic confirmation that ill serves the American people.\n  Another troubling nomination is that of William James Haynes to the \nFourth Circuit, which has been pending in the Republican-controlled \nSenate without action for 3 years. Mr. Haynes is the general counsel at \nthe Defense Department and was deeply involved developing the torture \npolicies, detention and interrogation policies, military tribunals, and \nother controversial aspects of the manner in which this administration \nhas proceeded unilaterally to make mistakes and exceed its legal \nauthority. Concerns about the Haynes nomination may not be confined to \nDemocratic Senators, according to recent press reports.\n  I trust that the Senate will not repeat the mistake it made before. \nIt was\n\n[[Page S5646]]\n\nonly after Jay Bybee was confirmed to a lifetime appointment to the \nNinth Circuit that we learned of his involvement with the infamous \nBybee memo seeking to justify torture and degrading treatment. I had \nasked him what he had worked on while head of the Department of \nJustice's Office of Legal Counsel, but he had refused to respond. This \nformer Defense Department and Justice Department insider now sits on \nthe Ninth Circuit for life.\n  Finally, there is the more recent nomination of Michael Wallace to a \nvacancy on the Fifth Circuit. Mr. Wallace received the first ABA rating \nof unanimously ``not qualified'' that I have seen for a circuit court \nnominee since President Reagan. Yet that is one of the controversial \nnominations we can expect the Republican Senate to target for action \ngiven their track record.\n  One of the most important checks and balances to unprecedented \noverreaching by the Bush-Cheney executive branch is an independent \njudiciary. I have sought to expedite consideration of qualified, \nconsensus nominees and urged the President to work with us to make \nselections that unite all Americans. When the White House fails to make \nthose kinds of selections, I hope that the Republican-controlled Senate \nwill stop rubberstamping them and stop using controversial judicial \nnominations to score partisan political points. Our courts are too \nimportant. The rights and liberties of the American people are too \nimportant. The courts are the only check and balance left to protect \nthe American people and provide some oversight of the actions of this \nPresident.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/08/senate-section/article/S5646-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5646-S5653]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        SUSAN C.

Mr. President, I strongly support the nomination of \nSusan Schwab to serve as U.S. Trade Representative.\n  It is almost 7 months to the day since the Senate unanimously \nconfirmed Ambassador Schwab to be Deputy U.S. Trade Representative.\n  During her service in that position, Ambassador Schwab has amply \ndemonstrated her qualifications to take over as our next trade \nrepresentative.\n  She successfully concluded negotiations of trade agreements with Peru \nand Columbia and has been actively engaged in the ongoing negotiations \nof the Doha Development Round of the World Trade Organization.\n  Given her strong background in trade policy, it is not surprising, \nthen, that Ambassador Schwab has served so well in her current \nposition.\n  Ambassador Schwab formally served as Assistant Secretary of Commerce \nand Director General of the United States and Foreign Commercial \nService. That is an agency within the Department of Commerce with \npeople on the ground in foreign countries pushing for the interest of \nU.S. businesses.\n  She, herself, worked abroad to advance U.S. trade objectives while \nserving as a trade policy officer in the U.S. embassy in Tokyo.\n  Her first job in Washington was as an agricultural trade negotiator \nfor the Office of U.S. Trade Representative. Ambassador Schwab thus \nknows full well the importance and the challenge of advancing the trade \ninterests of U.S. family farmers.\n  Ambassador Schwab also has extensive experience working for the \nCongress of the United States, the very committee that I chair. She \nspent 8 years during the 1980s as a trade policy specialist and then as \nlegislative director for then-Senator Danforth at a time when he \nchaired the trade subcommittee of this Committee on Finance.\n  Ambassador Schwab is well aware of the important role Congress plays \nin U.S. trade policy. I look forward to working closely with her in \nadvancing U.S. trade objectives.\n  In addition, Ambassador Schwab has experience working on trade issues \nalso in the private sector. At one point, she was director of corporate \nbusiness development for Motorola. In that position, she engaged in \nstrategic planning on behalf of Motorola in the continent of Asia.\n  More recently, she served as dean of the University of Maryland \nSchool of Public Policy. That was from 1995 through the year 2003, and \nthen as president and CEO of the University System of the Maryland \nFoundation, as well as serving as vice chancellor for advancement.\n  Her academic and private-sector experiences complement her strong \nbackground in Government service. She is well rounded, in other words. \nGiven the major challenges we face in advancing a robust trade agenda, \nit is especially important we have someone of Ambassador Schwab's \ncaliber serving as U.S. Trade Representative dealing with 149 countries \nthat are members of the World Trade Organization.\n  We need to achieve substantial progress in Doha Round negotiations, \nand soon, if we are going to succeed in getting an agreement before \ntrade promotion authority for the President of the United States \nexpires next year. We still have a long way to go on those negotiations \nto reach an ambitious outcome that would be acceptable to me as \nchairman of the committee, but I think I can speak for the entire \nCongress on that point.\n  We are also in the process of negotiating free trade agreements with \na number of important trading partners, including South Korea and \nMalaysia. These are going to represent terrific challenges. These are \ngoing to represent yet new challenges for her, particularly in \naddressing regulatory and other nontariff barriers to trade.\n  It is essential our bilateral negotiations with South Korea, \nMalaysia, and other nations conclude in time to be considered under \ntrade promotion authority which expires July next year.\n  In addition, it is important our next trade representative continue \nto encourage meaningful regulatory reform in other major trading \npartners, especially Japan and China.\n  I expect Ambassador Schwab to continue to push our trading partners \nto come into compliance with their existing trade obligations such as \nand not limited to these: Mexico's obligation under NAFTA and the World \nTrade Organization regarding the importation of U.S. agricultural \nproducts and China's obligations to protect intellectual property \nrights.\n  Separately, I expect any bilateral agreement on Russia's access to \nthe World Trade Organization will be concluded on strong, commercially \nmeaningful terms and will not be rushed to meet some artificial \ndeadline. Russia must demonstrate its willingness, its ability, and its \ncommitment to abide by World Trade Organization rules.\n  It is important we remind ourselves of the tremendous benefits we \nderive from open international trade because too often we hear \ncriticism of our trading regimes. As an example, on average, over the \npast decade, our economy has created a net of 2 million jobs each year. \nIn 2005, our unemployment rate dropped to 4.7 percent, which is well \nbelow the averages of the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s.\n\n  An important part of our economic success is due to our trade. During \nthe last decades, our exports have accounted for about one-quarter of \nU.S. economic growth. Jobs created by exports are estimated to pay 13 \nto 18 percent more on average compared to jobs unrelated to exports.\n  With respect to agriculture, approximately one-third of the acres \nplanted in the United States are exported. Our service sector, which \naccounts for almost 70 percent of the U.S. economy, is anxious to break \ndown barriers to our exports of services around the world.\n  Today our services exports account for a little more than a quarter \nof the total U.S. exports of goods and services, so breaking down \nbarriers to our\n\n[[Page S5647]]\n\nservices exports would go a long way toward helping us improve our \ntrade deficit.\n  Therefore, we in the Congress need to recommit ourselves to securing \nimproved market access for our exporters, both in the Doha Round \nnegotiations and by means of bilateral and regional trade agreements.\n  I am confident Ambassador Schwab will effectively meet each of the \nmany challenges she will face as our next trade representative. Her \nexperience and her skills make it quite evident she is the right person \nfor the job. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting her \nnomination. Once confirmed, I look forward to working with her to \nadvance an ambitious trade agenda and would expect her to consult under \nthe law trade promotion authority with our committees when we ask her \nto and when she thinks it is necessary for her to make advances to us \non that sort of communication because consultation between us prior to \na negotiation being signed is the basis for the success and the \nopportunity to get such an agreement through the Congress.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Would the Senator from Iowa let me speak for 2 or 3 \nminutes as in morning business?\n  I support the nominee. There is no objection by Senator Dorgan.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The Senator can have whatever time he desires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Shelby are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. SHELBY. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, what now is the business before the body?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Schwab nomination.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair.\n  Let me indicate as a member of the Finance Committee that we had \nhearings on the Schwab nomination. Let me stipulate that she is well \nqualified for the position. She is a lovely person, well educated and \nwell trained. With all that said, after her testimony before the \nFinance Committee, I decided reluctantly that I would oppose her \nnomination. I want to share very briefly with the Members why I made \nthat judgment.\n  When Ms. Schwab came before the Finance Committee, I put up a chart \nshowing what has happened to the trade deficit of the United States. \nThe trade deficit soared to over $700 billion last year. I had another \nchart that showed what has happened to the trade deficit with Mexico \nsince the NAFTA agreement. Before the NAFTA agreement, we had a trade \nsurplus with Mexico of several billion dollars. Now we have a massive \ntrade deficit with Mexico.\n  I asked Ms. Schwab: Is this a successful trade policy?\n  Her answer was: Yes.\n  I told her: If this is a success, I would hate to see a failure. \nBecause this trade policy is proving to be a disaster for the financial \nhealth of the United States. We are spending $700 billion a year more \nin purchases than we are in sales. A country cannot do that for very \nlong.\n  Then I asked her about agricultural trade policy. I asked her about \nthe strategy of our trade ambassador going into the trade talks and \nmaking unilateral concessions, offering to cut support for our \nproducers by 60 percent on the notion that then the other side would \nmake concessions to us. I told her this is the strangest way to \nnegotiate that I have ever seen. Unilateral concessions on the hope \nthat the other side will follow suit--who has ever seen that in a \nnegotiation? That is like going to the car dealership and agreeing to \npay the sticker price. Why would you ever do that?\n  Ms. Schwab told me this is actually a smart trade tactic, a \nnegotiating tactic, that you make big concessions on the front end and \nthen you get tougher at the end. I don't think that is smart. I think \nit is a disaster. We are in a circumstance in which the Europeans \nprovide five times as much support for their producers as we provide \nfor ours. They account for more than 90 percent of the export subsidy \nin the world. We are about 1 or 2 percent. So they have us outgunned \nthere 70 or 80 to 1.\n  Our idea of a negotiation is to make major unilateral concessions and \nthen hope the other side gives in. What happened with this strategy? \nDid Europe then follow and make major concessions in response to ours? \nNo. They made none.\n  I fear we are pursuing a trade agenda that is simply not working. I \nwould present as exhibit No. 1 record trade deficits, the biggest in \nour history and growing dramatically.\n  Exhibit No. 2, NAFTA: We signed on to the NAFTA agreement. Our \nleadership told us this was going to be a great success. At the time we \nhad a positive trade balance with Mexico. Now our trade deficit is \nmeasured in the tens of billions of dollars a year. This is a trade \npolicy that is not working.\n  I cannot support as our trade ambassador somebody who clearly \nbelieves that is a success. How could anyone define this as a success?\n  I have reluctantly concluded that if we were to have a vote, and \napparently this will be on a voice vote, I want it clearly recorded \nthat I would vote ``no.''\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I understand there is an order with \nrespect to my presentation on this matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has been allocated 30 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this reminds me of Madam Tussaud's wax \nmuseum. It looks like there are people here, except there is no \nmovement. Month after month after month, we hear the results of \nunbelievably bad trade agreements that pull the rug out from under our \nworkers and farmers, pulling the rug out from under our economy, \nringing up the highest trade deficits in the our history, shipping \nAmerican jobs overseas, even as we import cheap labor through the \nbackdoor, and no one says a thing. No one does a thing. We today have a \nproposal before us to approve the nomination of a new U.S. trade \nambassador. For what purpose?\n  Let me describe what is happening with our trade deficit. This is the \ntrade deficit from the most recent year going back to 1995. We are \nhemorrhaging in red ink.\n  These are the largest trade deficits in the history of humankind, by \nfar, not even close with any other country. What does this mean? This \nmeans that we are selling part of our country every day to those who \nlive outside of our country. It is called the selling of America.\n  We seem to think that it is all right to have a trade deficit of $2 \nbillion a day. That means that we import products more than we export \nto the rest of the world, and we pay for those imports with our \ncurrency or debt instruments. The result is at the moment the bank of \nKorea holds $200 billion of our currency; the Chinese, $750 billion; \nthe Japanese, $800 billion; the Taiwanese, $250 billion. We are \nliterally selling our country with these trade deficits every day.\n  Trade deficits are not just about selling America piece by piece. It \nis about shipping American jobs overseas and undercutting American \nworkers all at the same time.\n  Winston Churchill said: The further backward you look, the further \nforward you can see. So I will look back a little bit. It is surprising \nto me that we have the nomination of a trade ambassador on the floor of \nthe Senate and no real discussion, save that of my colleague, Senator \nConrad, about the merits of where we are headed. This country is \ndangerously off-track with wildly inflated and mushroomed trade \ndeficits. It is getting worse, much worse, not better. Yet there is not \na whimper here in the Congress about it.\n  Part of the reason is that the folks who work here are not going to \nhave their jobs outsourced. No one wearing a blue suit and suspenders \nwho hangs around here is going to have their job sent to China. If that \nwere the case, we would have a change in trade policy immediately. But \nnobody loses their job here. For that matter, no journalist loses their \njob. That is why all you\n\n[[Page S5648]]\n\nread, for example, in most of these major newspapers in support of this \ntrade policy that, as we can see from this chart, is a massive failure. \nJust take a look at a portion of it. Two hundred billion of that $700 \nbillion is with China alone. You can take a look at what is happening \nthere, dramatic growth.\n  Here is the trade strategy we are currently working under: exporting \ngood American jobs and importing cheap labor. We just finished \nimporting cheap labor with the immigration bill 2 weeks ago. I didn't \nsupport that. I voted against that. I voted against the trade \nagreements that have allowed us to export good jobs.\n  I have gone through at great length in the Senate a range of issues. \nLet me use a couple to describe what has happened and what our trade \nagreements are about.\n  We are now negotiating a trade agreement with Korea. Let me talk \nabout automobile trade with Korea. See if anybody cares about that, see \nmaybe if this new trade ambassador would care about that. Last year we \ngot 730,863 cars coming in on ships from Korea. They loaded all the \nKorean cars on ships, sailed across the ocean and offloaded 730,000 \nKorean cars in the United States.\n  Guess how many American cars we were able to sell in Korea. Seven \nhundred thirty thousand? No. Four thousand two hundred. Ninety-nine \npercent of the automobiles on the streets in Korea are produced in \nKorea. Why? They don't want American vehicles to be allowed into their \nmarket. They want to send their vehicles here for sale, but they don't \nwant our vehicles sold in Korea.\n  This imbalance exists. Does anybody care about it? It doesn't mean a \nthing to most people. What it means to a lot of families is they have \nlost their jobs. United Auto Workers have lost their jobs. But nobody \ncares much about that because nobody in this Chamber is going to lose \ntheir job because of this imbalance in automobile trade.\n  Japan: 95 percent of the cars driving in the streets of Japan are \nproduced in Japan. Why don't we export more cars to Japan? They don't \nwant them. They, like China and many other parts of the world, \nincluding Korea, want to exercise their right to send their products to \nthe American marketplace, but they sure don't want to have their \nmarketplace wide open to that which is produced by American workers. \nThat is the last thing they want.\n  Let me go back a few decades to 1970 or so. The largest American \ncorporation was General Motors. In most cases people who went to work \nfor GM worked there for a lifetime. That was their job. They were going \nto retire there and did. They worked there for a lifetime, got good \npay, good benefits, good retirement. Now, 30 years later, the largest \ncorporation in America is Wal-Mart. Average salary, according to \npublished reports, is about $18,000 or $19,000 a year.\n  A substantial portion of their employees have no benefits. Of those \neligible for health care benefits, they pay double the amount that most \nemployees of corporations would pay for health care. Many of those who \ndo have full-time jobs at low salaries cannot afford the benefits that \nare offered. So have we made progress in these 30 years?\n  By the way, with respect to Wal-Mart, 70 percent of the products on \ntheir shelves is from China. Wal-Mart's pressure will lead their to \nclose their American operations and move them to China. The only way to \nsell it the way the we want to is have it produced in China, where you \ncan pay a worker 33 cents an hour.\n  I read a month or so ago that China has finally purchased Whammo \nCorporation. There are a lot of companies moving, deciding they cannot \nafford to produce in America anymore. They don't want to pay U.S. \nworkers decent wages. They want to produce in China for 33 cents an \nhour, where you don't have to worry about health care and retirement. \nWe have seen 4 million to 5 million American jobs gone from our \ncountry.\n  I noticed in the newspaper that Chinese purchased Whammo \nCorporation--Frisbee, Hula Hoop, Slip 'N Slide. It is sort of the hood \nornament on what is wrong with our trade. So Whammo is gone. What about \nthe steelworker in America or the textile worker in America or the \nmetal fabricator in America or the family farmer or the software \nengineer--their jobs are gone in increasing numbers.\n  Alan Blinder, the former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, \nsaid recently in a Foreign Affairs article that there are roughly are \n42 million to 56 million jobs in America that are subject to being \noutsourced to other countries--China, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, \nand more.\n  American companies have discovered that this large planet has a \nbillion to a billion and a half people, and perhaps more, where if you \nmove the technology and capital, you can employ people in other parts \nof the world for pennies. You can hire kids, you can work 12-year-olds \n12 hours a day and pay them 12 cents an hour. You can ship the product \nto Toledo, Fargo, Los Angeles, or Lansing, MI, and say to the American \nproducer and business and worker: Compete with that. The fact is, you \ncannot compete with that, and you should not be asked to compete with \nthat.\n  We fought for a century in this country for the standards of \nproduction that have made this a great place and allowed us to expand \nthe middle class. I have spoken before about James Fyler, who died of \nlead poisoning; he was shot 54 times. Earlier in this century, he and \nothers were standing up for the right of people to organize, for \nworkers to be able to organize. We finally became a country in which \nworkers can organize without having to go to prison, like they do in \nChina. I have the names of people sitting in prison in China because \nthey wanted to organize workers for a fair deal. We signed the Fair \nLabor Standards Act in this country and established a minimum wage and \ngave people the right to organize. We did a whole series of things--\nchild labor laws--that have established the conditions of production, \nthat produced a burgeoning middle class and the strongest economy the \nworld has ever known. Now it is systematically being taken apart. I \nknow it is hard to see day by day, but you watch what is happening in \nthis country to the good jobs, the jobs with security that pay well, \nwith benefits. One by one, 1,000 by 1,000 and, yes, a million by a \nmillion, they are leaving this country.\n  No, it is not just the bottom rung of the economic ladder; it is also \nengineers, software producers, and others. Nobody here seems to care \nvery much. This Congress certainly doesn't. This Congress supports all \nthat. This Congress supports giving a tax break to companies that ship \ntheir jobs overseas. Show me a company that fires all the American \nworkers and ships their jobs to China, and I will tell you that this \nCongress supports giving that company a tax break--$1.2 billion a year \nour current Tax Code spends in tax cuts to companies that ship their \nAmerican jobs overseas. It is unbelievable.\n  I have offered four amendments in this Senate to shut that perverse \ntax break down and I have lost four times. In 2005, Bo Anderson, one of \nthe top executives at General Motors dealing with parts and supplies, \ncalled 380 parts and suppliers together; he called the executives of \nthe parts suppliers to a meeting. He said to them that you need to be \nbuilding your automobile parts in China to reduce the cost. In other \nwords, move those jobs offshore, get rid of those American workers. \nDelphi, which used to be the largest General Motors parts supplier, \nwere paying workers $26 to $30 an hour with benefits. Well, that is \nover. They are in bankruptcy and, of course, it is blamed on the \nworkers. Nobody talked about the executives and what role they might \nhave had. They want to outsource the jobs, and for the jobs they would \nkeep here, they want to pay $8 to $10 an hour. I am wondering how you \ncreate a country with a growing middle class and a consumer ability to \nmake purchases in this country if jobs are going elsewhere in search of \npennies an hour. IBM laid off 13,000 people; they are going to ship the \njobs to India. They said to workers, by the way: This is not a comment \non the excellent work you have done. See you later. Your job is gone.\n  The question is, What are we building and what does all this mean? \nThe reason I mention all of this is that all of it comes from trade \nagreements. We have all of these trade agreements, and one is NAFTA \nwith Mexico. We turned\n\n[[Page S5649]]\n\na small trade surplus into a giant deficit with Mexico. It is pretty \nunbelievable when you think about it. My colleague says that the \ncurrent nominee believes that the trade agreement with Mexico is a huge \nsuccess. She has not lost her job to outsourcing either. But it is not \na success by any standard. The trade deficit with Mexico and with \nCanada and with Europe, with Japan, Korea, and China--it is a disaster. \nNobody seems to care much.\n  Now, I want to talk a little about this notion of free trade. It \nsounds like such a wonderful term, ``free trade.'' Freedom. Free trade \nmeans that you want to substitute that which we have fought for and \nbuilt, that which people have died for, that which people have debated \nfor a long time--what are the standards of production? What is being an \nAmerican all about? What is protecting children? What is a fair wage? \nWhat is a safe workplace? What is the right to organize worth? It is \ntrading that in and saying none of that matters. The largest \ncorporations can pole-vault over all of it and move their factory to \nChina. We are taking apart that which we built for a century. That is \nwhat the trade agreements are doing. I have shown you the red ink. So \nthe trade agreements are an abysmal failure.\n  I would like to speak now about something that we learned very \nrecently, involving sweatshops in the country of Jordan.\n  At the outset, let me say that the trade agreement with Jordan was \nslightly better than all the others. I give credit to President Clinton \nbecause they negotiated a free trade agreement with Jordan that had \nstandards with respect to workers' rights, for a change. So it was a \nstep forward--not a giant step but a step in the right direction.\n  What has happened to trade with Jordan since that time? The New York \nTimes has written an article based on some work by the National Labor \nCommittee. They have done terrific work investigating what is going on \nin Jordan. Remember, this was supposed to have created the gold \nstandard for labor protection for workers, signed in 1999. But what \nhappened since then is that Jordan has flown in so-called guest workers \nfrom countries such as Bangladesh and China to make products in Jordan \nfor export to this country. So we see products in stores such as Wal-\nMart, Target, and others, that have now, we know, come from sweatshops \nin Jordan under our free trade agreement.\n\n  Here is how the New York Times describes these sweat shops:\n\n       Propelled by a free trade agreement with the U.S., apparel \n     manufacturing is booming in Jordan. Exports to America are \n     soaring twentyfold in the last 5 years. But some foreign \n     workers in Jordanian factories that produce garments for \n     Target, Wal-Mart, and others are complaining of dismal \n     conditions--of 20-hour days, of not being paid for months and \n     months, of being hit by supervisors and of being jailed when \n     they complain.\n\n  These factories in Jordan are flying in planeloads of workers from \nthe poorest countries, such as Bangladesh, to work in slavelike \nconditions. They also ship in Chinese materials--textiles in this \ncase--to those manufacturers. What you end up with are Bangladesh \nworkers working up to 120 hours a week in sweatshops in Jordan piecing \ntogether Chinese materials to be shipped into the United States under \nfree trade agreements to be sold in a Wal-Mart or a Target.\n  Is that what free trade agreements are supposed to be about? I don't \nthink so.\n  The workers at these Jordanian sweatshops testified they were forced \nto work far below minimum wages, promised $120 a month, but in many \ncases they were not paid at all. One worker paid $50 for 5 months of \nwork. It is unbelievable to see what is going on.\n  Then when this is exposed in the New York Times, you hear people say: \nWell, we had no idea this was going on. It is kind of akin to the \nFrench police chief in the movie Casablanca, he was shocked to find \nthat there was gambling taking place in Rick's Cafe. Nobody ought to be \nshocked by this. This is what is going on in the world.\n  I am going to introduce legislation at the end of my presentation \ntoday dealing with these issues of sweatshops and how we try to respond \nto them. My legislation will establish substantial civil penalties for \nthe import of sweatshop goods. When sweatshop factories abuse workers \nfor profit, the best way to attack the problem is to take that profit \naway. If the Federal Trade Commission determined that an overseas \nfactory was producing sweatshop labor, it would issue an order \nprohibiting importation from that factory. Violation would carry a \ncivil penalty, and each separate violation would be a separate offense. \nAlso, my bill would allow U.S. retailers the right to sue their \ncompetitors in U.S. courts if their competitors are sourcing their \nmerchandise from these sweatshop factories.\n  I feel strongly that as we come to talk about trade today and the \nnomination of a new trade ambassador, we ought to talk about what is \ngoing on in the real world. I have described previously so many \nstories. I was going to talk about Maytag--you know, the repairman who \nhas nothing to do, and part of that is because Maytag is moving its \njobs overseas these days.\n  Here are the dancing grapes in this picture. I love the dancing \ngrapes from Fruit of the Loom. They make shorts and T-shirts that are \nall over America, and they have these people dressed up as grapes. Who \non Earth would dress up as a grape? I guess a job is a job. Who is \ndancing in grape suits these days? That is the way they advertise this \nAmerican underwear. Guess what. It may still be all-American underwear, \nbut it is not made here anymore. They danced right out of this country. \nFruit of the Loom is gone to Mexico. And it is not just Fruit of the \nLoom. The best example I know is Huffy bicycles. They are now a Chinese \ncompany. They got rid of all their Ohio workers; they fired them \nbecause they made too much money, $11 an hour. They have now become a \nChinese company. You can still buy them here, and they produce a \nproduct they call all-American. It is just that they are made in China. \nI happen to know where. They pay 33 cents an hour there, and all those \nAmerican workers who lost jobs, who had a long career making these \nbicycles at the largest bicycle plant in the world, they were told: \nYour career is over. You make too much money at $11 an hour, so Huffy \nhas gone to China. If you had a Huffy years ago, you noticed there was \nan American flag decal on the front. That is gone too. Now it is a \ndecal of the globe.\n  By the way, on the last day of work at Huffy Bicycles, when their \njobs left for China, I was told that when the workers left the parking \nlot, as they drove out of the lot, they left a pair of empty shoes in \nthe space where their car was. It was a way of saying to the company \nthat you can move our jobs to China, but you are not going to be able \nto fill our shoes. That is how much they cared about their jobs.\n\n  Little red wagon, Radio Flyer--I bet there is not a kid around who \nhasn't ridden in that little red wagon. Of course, that was American \nfor a century. Gone to China. The list goes on and on. I could talk for \nhours about companies.\n  Levi's. There is not one pair of Levi's made in America. Talk about \nall-American jeans--there is not one pair of Levi's made in America. If \nyou wear Tony Lama boots, you might be wearing boots made in China, by \nthe way. The list goes on and on.\n  The question for this nominee for the U.S. Trade Ambassador's job is, \nDo you care whether these jobs are gone from our country? Do you care \nwhether Americans are now asked to compete against those in other parts \nof the world who make 33 cents an hour? Do you care about that? Do you \ncare that our workers are asked to compete against young kids, some of \nthem locked in manufacturing plants, some of them hand-weaving rugs, \nsome of them whose fingertips were scarred by putting sulfur on the \nfingertips and lighting the sulfur in order to produce a scar so that \nwhen they are using the needles on the rug and they stick their \nfingers, they won't bleed? Do you care about all that?\n  How about a trade policy that stands up for the interests of our \ncountry? Yes, I think we ought to trade. Yes, I think expanded trade is \ngood for our country. But it must be and has to be fair trade. You \ncannot say to companies: All right, we have decided over a century what \nthe conditions of production are in this country that represent a \ngrowing middle class and a growing economy and a humane way to do \nthings. We have decided that, but you\n\n[[Page S5650]]\n\ncan avoid all of that by just deciding to shut your American \nmanufacturing plant, move the jobs elsewhere, and if somebody messes \nwith you when your plant has moved overseas and they want to organize \nworkers for better wages, you can get the government to throw them in \nprison. If somebody cares about you putting poisons in the water and \nthe air, pumping effluent and pollution into the water and the air, you \ndon't have to worry about that because you can do that with impunity. \nWhen somebody says you can't hire children, you don't have to worry \nabout that because you can put kids in your manufacturing plant. And if \nsomebody says OSHA is going to come, you can say: There ain't no OSHA \nhere; I can do what I want here. And by the way, when I get the product \nproduced, I am shipping it to the United States of America because I \nhave store shelves to fill and I have American customers who want low \nprices. I know, they are the same customers who are going to drive \nKorean cars to the store, wear their Italian shoes, wear their \nTaiwanese shirt, wear their Chinese slacks, and they are going to \nwonder where all the American jobs went.\n  I would like to ask one of these days when we have a change in the \nU.S. trade ambassador's job what they really think success is. Do you \nreally believe this hemorrhaging of red ink, selling America $2 billion \na day to foreign governments, foreign enterprises, do you really \nbelieve that can continue? It cannot. That just cannot continue.\n  And, oh, by the way, the strategy I described earlier that I believe \ndoesn't add up for our country is a strategy by which we tell \ncompanies: You can export good American jobs, and you can import cheap \nlabor. That was the immigration bill, the last portion--export good \njobs, import cheap labor. I am saying that doesn't add up.\n  At least a portion of that--exporting good jobs and importing cheap \nlabor--is now attended to by a desire to decide that when you export \ngood jobs and import cheap labor, you can run your profits through the \nCayman Islands so you don't have to pay taxes in this country.\n  This little house, I have told my colleagues before, this five-story \nwhite house, called the Ugland House on Church Street in the Cayman \nIslands, is home to 12,748 corporations. That is right. They are not \nthere; it is just a figment of someone's imagination. Lawyers have \nestablished this address for 12,748 corporations for one purpose, and \nthat is to avoid paying U.S. taxes. It is unbelievable, if you think \nabout it.\n  So export your jobs, import your products here, sell them in the \nUnited States, and run your income through the Cayman Islands. I am \njust saying none of this adds up and none of it works.\n  I agree with my colleague who described a while ago his opposition to \nthis trade ambassador. I don't believe the nominee is unqualified, I \njust believe there our trade policy is terribly misguided. That is \npretty troublesome because I don't think this country will have the \nkind of economic strength that expands so that our kids have jobs, good \njobs that pay well with benefits in the future. I don't think it is \ngoing to happen. I wish I were wrong. I don't think I am. Yet all this \ncontinues in a giant silence. Nobody seems to care very much.\n  Let's just continue doing this. We will sell a little bit of America \nevery single day, keep shipping jobs elsewhere, not think much about it \nbecause we can buy a cheap product at Wal-Mart, and it will be just \nfine. Be happy. I am just saying I don't think this adds up for our \ncountry's future.\n  I don't support this nomination because I want a nominee at the U.S. \ntrade ambassador's office who is going to stand up for a trade policy \nthat is fair for this country--fair trade.\n  A colleague just came into the Chamber who comes from a State that \nhas a lot of ranching. We are not getting beef into Japan at the \nmoment. That is a different story. It is unbelievable with the trade \ndeficit that we can't get beef into Japan. Let's assume that problem \nwas resolved tomorrow. Every pound of beef that would go into Japan \nwould have a 50-percent tariff on it, and that's 16 years after we had \na beef agreement with Japan. That is just a tiny little example, beef \nto Japan. That would be considered a failure by any standard, a 50-\npercent tariff a decade and a half after the beef agreement.\n  We blithely go along and say: Be happy, it will be fine, drive to \nWal-Mart and pick up an Etch-A-Sketch and be happy. It doesn't matter. \nThis will all work out in the end.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 4 additional \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I conclude by describing one of the \nconcerns I have about the silence on these issues. Some long while ago, \nI was on the floor of the House of Representatives when there was a \njoint meeting of Congress. A fellow named Lech Walesa was speaking to \nCongress at a joint meeting.\n  Lech Walesa told a story--pretty unbelievable--a story, of course, I \nhad known from the history books. He told us this: He said it was \nSaturday morning in a shipyard in Gdansk, Poland. He had been fired \nfrom his job as an electrician from this plant. He went back into the \nshipyards on Saturday morning to lead a labor strike against the \nCommunist government, believing workers ought to have the right to \nself-determination. He went back in to lead a strike against the \nCommunist government. They seized him that Saturday morning and \nbrutally beat him, beat him bloody, took him to the edge of a fence \nthat was heightened with barbed wire and threw him over the barbed-wire \nfence into the dirt on the other side of the fence.\n  He laid in the dirt face down, bleeding, having been beaten severely. \nHe told us he wondered what he should do next. As he lay there, he \ndecided what to do next. He picked himself up, climbed back over \nthe fence into the shipyard, right back into the same shipyard that \nmorning. Ten years later, this unemployed electrician was identified by \nthe Doorkeeper of the U.S. House of Representatives as the President of \nthe country of Poland--not an intellectual, not a military leader, not \na business leader, just an unemployed electrician with the guts to take \non the Communist government for a free labor movement.\n\n  They called it Solidarity. We all celebrated solidarity. What a \nwonderful thing it was. We supported Solidarity. He said to us: We \ndidn't have any guns; the Communists had all the guns. We had no \nbullets; the Communists had all the bullets. We were workers armed with \nan idea. We were armed only with an idea; that is, people ought to be \nfree to choose their own destiny.\n  What is the idea here? What is the idea in America by which we fought \nfor 100 years for the basic standards, by which we expanded the middle \nclass, safe workplaces, decent wages, the right to organize? What is \nthat idea, and does it have value now, or have we forgotten that idea \nand is there someone willing to stand for that idea today?\n  I hope so. I don't believe we ought to decide that which we created \nis somehow unworthy as we look to the future of this country, and I \nbelieve we ought to continue to build a place that is better for our \nchildren. We want a place, all of us want a place we can turn over to \nour children and grandchildren that is better than the place we \ninherited. That ought to be the goal.\n  I don't intend to ask for a recorded vote, but I do not support this \nnomination only because I think we are headed toward a trade strategy--\nand we have been in the middle of it for some long while now--that is \ninjuring this country and is going to ship jobs overseas.\n  As I said when I started, Alan Blinder, a respected Vice Chairman of \nthe Federal Reserve Board, said there are 42 million to 56 million \nAmerican jobs at this point subject to outsourcing. Those not \noutsourced are still going to be required to compete with others in the \nworld who make a great deal less money. That is not the way we are \ngoing to continue to build the economy we believed we were building for \nthe last century.\n  I am not suggesting putting walls around our country. I am not a \nxenophobe. I am not an isolationist. I am not one who believes trade is \nnot worthy. I do. But I think this country\n\n[[Page S5651]]\n\nought to insist and lead in the area of demanding fair trade, demanding \ntrade be fair, standing up for our businesses, standing up for our \nworkers, and saying we insist on and demand fair trade.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I speak today in support of the \nnomination of Dr. Susan Schwab to be the U.S. Trade Representative. I \nhave known Susan for a long time and have seen her great leadership and \nvision as dean of the University of Maryland School of Public Policy. \nAs dean, Susan helped the school grow into one of the top public policy \nprograms in the Nation.\n  I support fair trade, so American workers can compete. Dr. Schwab has \ndemonstrated her commitment to this approach and to ensuring our \nNation's economic competitiveness. Our top trade representative needs \nto be tough, smart, and have experience standing up for American \ninterests. Dr. Schwab clearly fits that bill as well.\n  Dr. Schwab's qualifications for this position are first-rate. She is \na former Foreign Service officer, serving in the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo \nand as a trade negotiator at the USTR. The experience of serving on the \nfront lines of an office she will now help lead is particularly \nimportant. Dr. Schwab also has extensive experience in both the \nlegislative and executive branches of the Federal Government. She was \nlegislative director for Senator John Danforth and served as Assistant \nSecretary of Commerce and Director-General of the U.S. & Foreign \nCommercial Service in the first Bush administration.\n  In addition to her practical experience, Dr. Schwab is accomplished \nacademically. While dean of the Maryland School of Public Policy, she \ntaught a variety of graduate courses on U.S. trade policy and \ninternational relations. Dr. Schwab received her Ph.D. in public \nadministration and international business from the George Washington \nUniversity. She holds a master's in development policy from Stanford \nUniversity and a bachelor's from Williams College.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this nomination.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to offer my strong support \nand endorsement of the confirmation of Ambassador Susan Schwab as U.S. \nTrade Representative. During her long career in public service, \nAmbassador Schwab has dedicated herself to advocating for the best \ninterests of the United States in the global economy. I was delighted \nwhen I learned that the President had nominated her for the position of \nU.S. Trade Representative, a position for which she is ideally suited.\n  Throughout the 1980s, Ambassador Schwab was as a trade policy \nspecialist and then legislative director for Senator John C. Danforth, \nplaying a major role in numerous U.S. trade policy initiatives, \nincluding landmark trade legislation that Congress enacted in 1984 and \n1988. While serving on the staff of Senator William S. Cohen and as \nstaff director of the Subcommittee on Government Oversight, I worked \nclosely with Ambassador Schwab on a number of trade issues affecting \nMaine and its industries.\n  In particular, Ambassador Schwab worked with our staff to support \nMaine's shoe industry and its workers during the industry's massive \ndislocations in the 1980s. She was instrumental in helping us develop \nlegislation to address the industry's dire situation in those years, \nincluding critical improvements to antidumping, countervailing duty, \nand safeguard provisions. She also worked closely with our staff to \nimprove market access for Maine agricultural goods in foreign markets.\n  Ambassador Schwab's professional and personal record of service will \nenable her to effectively represent U.S. interests around the world. \nShe will make an outstanding U.S. Trade Representative.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I strongly support the nomination of Susan \nSchwab to be our next U.S. Trade Representative. I have known and \nworked with Ambassador Schwab for many years. She has had a stellar \ncareer as a trade negotiator, a senior congressional staffer, a \nbusinesswoman, and a university administrator and professor.\n  I recently read a piece about Ambassador Schwab in the Washington \nPost. That article described her as ``a hard-nosed pragmatist, well \nversed in arcane trade economics, and a dazzling strategist and \nnegotiator.''\n  She was described as excelling as ``a strategic thinker and consensus \nbuilder . . . able to quickly synthesize the thinking of Congress, the \nadministration and special-interest groups.''\n  That Washington Post article is 19 years old. It is from July 1987. \nBy that point, Ambassador Schwab had already honed her reputation in \nthe international trade community.\n  She had already negotiated tricky agriculture agreements in the Tokyo \nRound. She had already helped draft provisions of U.S. trade law--like \nSuper 301--that became a fixture of U.S. trade policy for the next \ndecade.\n  She had already attracted both fear and admiration among many of our \nmost recalcitrant trading partners.\n  Nineteen years later, Ambassador Schwab continues to demonstrate her \nskill as a seasoned trade negotiator. In her tenure as Deputy U.S. \nTrade Representative, she has settled one of the most difficult and \ncomplicated trade issues--our dispute with Canada over subsidized \nimports of softwood lumber.\n  She has worked tirelessly with our trading partners on trade \nagreements, and she has worked to obtain consensus among the 149 \nmembers of the World Trade Organization in the ongoing Doha Round \nnegotiations.\n  Ambassador Schwab will need all of her skills to carry out the job as \nU.S. Trade Representative. We have entered one of the most difficult \nperiods in trade policy that I can remember--both with our trading \npartners and domestically.\n  At the top of Ambassador Schwab's agenda will be shoring up the Doha \nRound. Unless something changes soon, these talks are at serious risk \nof collapse.\n  Our trading partners continue to believe that America alone must make \nthe concessions necessary for these talks to conclude. They forget that \nnegotiations are two-way. They are give and take.\n  As I have told Ambassador Schwab, I will not be in a position to \nsupport any result out of the Doha Round unless several results are \nachieved: No. 1, the EU must commit to serious and meaningful \nreductions in agriculture tariffs; No. 2, Brazil, India, and developing \nworld countries must commit to serious and meaningful reductions in \nindustrial tariffs; and No. 3, our key trading partners must agree to \nopen further their services markets.\n  Ambassador Schwab will also face serious challenges in our bilateral \ntrade and economic relationship with China. China often makes \npromises--in the WTO and bilaterally--that it does not always keep. For \ninstance, in April, China promised to lift its ban on U.S. beef. But \nChina still has not done so, and it appears to be in no hurry.\n  In the coming months, I hope to work with Ambassador Schwab in \ncreating a more sustained, structured, and comprehensive dialogue with \nChina that allows the United States to hold China's feet to the fire on \nthe promises that it makes.\n  And we also need a better framework to seek out ways to cooperate \nmore effectively on issues of mutual economic interest.\n  Ambassador Schwab will also be responsible for negotiating the most \nchallenging free-trade agreements to date. Agreements with Korea and \nMalaysia--our 7th and 10th largest trading partners respectively--hold \ngreat promise. But each presents unique and difficult issues that we \nmust address in order to build political support for these agreements \nat home.\n  That will be Ambassador Schwab's greatest challenge--building \npolitical support for trade at home. It is no secret that support for \ntrade has evaporated.\n  Since Congress granted this administration trade promotion authority \nin 2002, Members have been asked to take a series of difficult votes on \ntrade agreements with small countries of limited commercial value.\n  Since that time, the concerns Members of Congress have expressed \nabout the administration's trade strategy have fallen on deaf ears, and \nsince that time, support for trade among usually protrade constituents \nhas waned considerably.\n  As a result, when trade promotion authority expires next year, I do \nnot think Congress will renew it without major changes. I do not \nanticipate new\n\n[[Page S5652]]\n\nfast-track authority until Congress, the administration, and all \nrelevant stakeholders are willing to engage in a serious discussion. \nThey need to answer the tough questions that remain unaddressed: \nquestions relating to trade adjustment assistance and other programs to \nhelp those who may be hurt by trade, questions about the role of labor \nin our trade agreements, and questions relating to the relationship \nbetween trade and a competitive U.S. economy.\n  These are hard issues, and Ambassador Schwab will have to face them \nhead-on. But I have full confidence that Ambassador Schwab has the \nskills, experience, and the guts to tackle them. Indeed, she spent most \nof the 1980s grappling with very similar issues when she worked for \nSenator Danforth in both the majority and the minority.\n  Nineteen years ago, the Washington Post described Susan Schwab as a \n``strategic thinker'' and a ``consensus builder.'' We need these skills \nat the U.S. Trade Representative, now more than ever.\n  I look forward to working closely with Ambassador Schwab and urge my \nColleagues to vote to confirm her today.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I rise to give my complete support \nfor Ambassador Susan Schwab who will become our Nation's Trade \nRepresentative.\n  I have been dismayed that the Senate did not move more quickly on \nthis nomination. I have also been disappointed by the opinions, of \nsome, who state that her nomination is an indication that the \nadministration is deemphasizing trade policy.\n  Obviously, these individuals do not know Ambassador Schwab.\n  I, on the other hand, have had that privilege of working with her and \njoin the vast majority of my colleagues in stating that that Ambassador \nSchwab is a tenacious, forceful, yet thoughtful advocate of our \nNation's trade agenda.\n  Our Nation is at a critical juncture. In 2005, the United States \ntrade deficit widened to a record $726 billion, increasing to 5.8 \npercent of the Gross Domestic Product from 5.3 percent in 2004, and 4.5 \npercent in 2003.\n  Many economists now describe the trade deficit as unsustainable. For \nexample, C. Fred Bergsten, Director of the Institute for International \nEconomics, has pointed out ``the United States must now attract almost \n$7 billion of capital from the rest of the world every day to finance \nour current account deficit and our own foreign investment outflows.''\n  In order to meet these challenges, we need our best and brightest \nworking on solutions. Solutions that ensure that that the Doha Round \nlives up to its potential, while ensuring that a level playing field is \ncreated for American farmers, manufactures and service providers.\n  Solutions that enable the United States to move expeditiously in our \nfree trade negotiations with Korea and Malaysia thereby providing \nunfettered access to these markets.\n  Mr. President, I cannot think of anyone better suited to find these \nsolutions then Ambassador Susan Schwab. I am very pleased that the \nSenate confirmed her nomination just minutes ago.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, how much time is on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Grassley controls 20 minutes.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, it is a pleasure for me to have the \nopportunity to discuss the nominee who is before the Senate. I am \nchairman of the Trade Subcommittee on the Finance Committee, so I have \nhad an opportunity to deal with some of these issues for some time. I \nwas also chairman of the Foreign Relations subcommittee on Asia and the \nPacific Rim. These are areas about which I feel strongly.\n  Fortunately, I had a good deal of opportunity to visit with Susan \nSchwab, the President's nominee for U.S. Trade Representative.\n  Obviously, this is a very important position, the position that Rob \nPortman had over the past 9 months or a year. He has done an excellent \njob of representing the United States in a situation that is not easy.\n  The United States is a little different from most countries in the \nworld. They see us a little differently. They expect more from us than \nwe should be asked to give, but nevertheless that continues to be the \ncase. We have to seek to find equality and fairness.\n  Based on my discussions with her, I think she is an outstanding \nselection. Senator Grassley talked about her background, and certainly \nshe is well prepared for the position. Her credentials speak for \nthemselves. That is very important in this issue.\n  Trade is very easy to talk about. Some of my friends on the other \nside talk about trade is all bad and there is nothing right about it. \nThere is a lot to trade that we have to figure out. We have a lot of \ndemand for overseas goods and, of course, we are the biggest buyer in \nthe world; therefore, we are the biggest trader in the world. So it \nfeels a little differently. It doesn't mean we should not have fair and \nequal treatment. That is what we seek to have, and that will be the \ntask she undertakes. She will be a strong voice for American trade \npolicy. I believe that is excellent, and I am so pleased.\n  We are the largest trading nation in the world, and the world is \nchanging, as we know. Twenty years ago, it was quite different. \nEveryone was fairly isolated. Now, with the kind of communications we \nhave and the kind of transportation that is available--why, there are \nbillions of dollars moving around the world every day. It becomes quite \ndifficult. The countries are changing very fast.\n  We deal with China today much differently than we did 10 years ago, \nas we will have to in the future. Foreign trade is not an easy matter \nwith which to deal. What we need to seek and do seek is fairness. \nFrankly, that is a little difficult in the world because everyone \nthinks that because we are such a prosperous country, they should have \nspecial treatment. But our effort has been to have fair trade, and that \nought to be what we do, and that is what we are seeking.\n  I have met with Susan Schwab and talked about that point, and the \nfact that we are the largest trading country in the world should not \ngive others an unfair advantage. We need to trade in a fair way, and I \nthink that is what she is committed to do, and certainly I support her \nfor that.\n\n  We are the largest trading nation in the world. So, of course, we are \nthe target of most everyone who wants to increase their sales. We also, \nhowever, have some opportunities to increase our sales as well, and we \nare doing some of that. Our demand, because the size of our economy, of \ncourse, is large, and we are interested in pursuing those kinds of \nopportunities. So trade is going to happen, and it is going to \nincreasingly happen as times change and the world becomes smaller. \nSimply because of our ability to communicate and our ability to move \naround the world, it will become smaller.\n  So the challenge is how we can trade fairly with these other \ncountries. Many of them think, Oh, you are the big, rich country; you \nought to be able to give us a lot of things. That really ought not to \nbe what we are dealing with. We ought to be dealing with fair trade. I \nthink that is the point. It is what I have talked to Susan Schwab \nabout, and she certainly is agreeable to that.\n  More than 25 percent of the U.S. gross domestic product is tied to \ntrade, so it is an important aspect of our economy. Ninety-six percent \nof the world's consumers live outside of the United States. So in terms \nof our production, we need to be involved in world trade and we need to \nmake it fair. And that really, of course, is the challenge.\n  It is easy to be critical about everything we do in trade. The fact \nis, particularly with some of the commodities in my State of Wyoming, \ntrade is about selling our markets somewhere else. So we need to \nunderstand that. Again, the key is fair trade and that is what we are \ntalking about. We need to find ways to open the world market to our \ngoods and our services, and we ought to be able to enter into the \nmarket on the same basis as anyone else, and at the same time hold \nothers to the same considerations that we have when they come here. We \nneed to pursue both bilateral and multilateral negotiations, and of \ncourse that is what we are doing. And we need strong leadership to do \nit and to represent our interests in these discussions.\n\n[[Page S5653]]\n\n  So I think that is exactly what we will be able to do. We are making \nprogress.\n  My colleague mentioned the fact of the cow business in Japan. Well, \nthat is a problem. Frankly, it is not a trade problem as much as it is \na mad cow disease problem. It has been handled wrong, and we are \nworking toward getting that resolved. Our best potential and the \nlargest growth we have in the beef industry and exports has been in \nAsia. That is where we are now. We have been able to open up the \nmarkets in Australia and in South Korea, and we had the markets pretty \nmuch open in Japan until the mad cow disease came along, and now we are \nin the process, hopefully, of getting them open again. So that is very \nimportant, and we need to continue certainly to do that.\n  We need a strong leader to represent our interests. I think that is \nexactly what we will get with Susan Schwab, and that leadership is what \nwe need. Bob Portman has done a very good job, and she has worked with \nhim, of course, in getting us into this position. So we need to have \ngood leadership to walk away from some of the bad agreements, the tough \nagreements that we have had. The world is sometimes difficult to deal \nwith, but Susan Schwab will provide that leadership.\n  During her testimony before the Finance Committee, of which I am a \nmember, she stated:\n\n       It will take more than a willing spirit to forge good trade \n     policy in the next 5 years. It will require us to keep the \n     multilateral process on track in the WTO, to negotiate \n     commercially significant free trade agreements, and to \n     enforce vigorously the terms of those agreements and to \n     uphold the rules of trade.\n\n  So that is what we are really faced with. These smaller countries, \nthese countries that frankly generally have less economic strength than \nwe do and they always want special treatment: Well, you guys can afford \nthat. What we need is fair trade, and that is what trade is all about, \nand that is why it takes a leader to do that. So I am very pleased that \nshe is there and that she is willing to do this. She is well trained to \ndo it.\n  She further stated that her success may require:\n\n       An honest, sometimes blunt, but always respectful exchange \n     of views, along with a willingness to compromise when \n     possible and the strength to stand firm when necessary.\n\n  The strength to stand firm when necessary. To me, that is probably \nthe most important element of the trade negotiations that we enter \ninto, is to be able to stand firm on what we agree on, and we ought to \nbe in a position to do that when we are as big a buyer as we are. We \nalso need to have some muscle on the other side, and we can do that.\n  I am pleased with the commitment she has made to reach out and listen \nand consult with Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle. \nEngaging Congress in a bipartisan way upfront and throughout the \nprocess will be crucial, and she will do that. Ms. Schwab understands \nthis, and I am confident that she will follow through.\n  So I look forward to working with her. I am looking forward to one of \nthe important elements of our economy, and that is world trade, and \ndoing it in a fair manner.\n  Mr. President, I yield back all time on behalf of Republicans and \nDemocrats and ask for a vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Susan C. Schwab, of Maryland, to be United \nStates Trade Representative?\n  The nomination was confirmed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, earlier today, we witnessed an important \nvictory in the war on terror and in the continued march of freedom and \ndemocracy in Iraq.\n  Al-Zarqawi, like Saddam Hussein, was a mass murderer. I am not sad to \nsay that he has made his last video.\n  I could not be more proud of our men and women in uniform--our \nmilitary and intelligence services and those individuals who \nparticipated in this particular operation. Our intelligence and \nmilitary forces have demonstrated their exceptional abilities and \nreminded us yet again that, through patience and resolve, we will \ncontinue to win the war on terror and advance the cause of freedom \naround the globe.\n  So I want to say to our military forces and our intelligence \ncommunity serving all around the world that we support you, we are \nproud of you, and we know that you will continue to keep up the good \nwork.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, last night the U.S. military, as we know \nnow, working hand in hand with the Iraqi counterpart, located and \nkilled al-Qaida terrorist Abu Mus'ab al-Zarqawi. We know who this \nterrorist is. He is a brutal terrorist who has repeatedly encouraged \nviolence against Americans and Iraqi citizens.\n  Al-Zarqawi is credited with ordering kidnappings, beheadings, and \nkillings of innocent civilians with insurgent attacks. Al-Zarqawi was \nthe operational mastermind of the al-Qaida network in Iraq. He sought \nto destroy America and our coalition partners to create a sanctuary for \nthe al-Qaida organization in the Middle East. His death marks the \nfragmentation of al-Qaida's primary leadership and the silencing of a \nruthless terrorist.\n  The military operation against al-Zarqawi was performed by our \ndedicated, professional Armed Forces in concert with our coalition \npartner. Our military servicemembers should be commended for their \nremarkable efforts in eradicating the enemy of a free and democratic \nIraq.\n  Our war fighters worked tirelessly with our Iraqi counterparts \ntracking the movement of al-Zarqawi's followers, leading to his demise \nin last night's airstrike.\n  We are proud of the success of this operation, but even prouder of \nthe job that our Armed Forces have accomplished in their commitment to \npeace and stability in Iraq. Although this is positive development and \nsignificant step in the global war on terror, our fight in Iraq is far \nfrom over. We are making significant strides toward eradicating \nterrorism, developing a free government, and reviving the economy. But \nIraq will not become a democracy overnight. While our involvement \ncontinues to be difficult, our resolve must remain strong. We must \nremain focused on our fundamental goal--preserving the freedom and \nsecurity of the United States. This is an enormous challenge that will \ntake determination, global cooperation, and fortitude to succeed. I am \nconfident the United States will triumph over global chaos and tyranny, \nas it always has. But whatever it is, we must back our troops.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/08/senate-section/article/S5653-4", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5653-S5654]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RECIPIENTS OF THE ``HEROES AMONG US'' AWARD\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

Mr. President, extreme weather conditions pounded much \nof South Dakota in 2005, leaving nearly 60 out of the State's 66 \ncounties eligible for Federal disaster aid. Many family farmers and \nranchers have had little reprieve from the previous year of harsh \nweather conditions, as blizzards and drought have already hampered the \n2006 production year. On top of natural disasters, low commodity prices \nand skyrocketing energy costs are forcing producers to make tough \ndecisions in order to keep their operations afloat. I believe we can do \nmore to help ease the burdens that our producers bear, and I want to \ndraw the Senate's attention to a handful of South Dakota counties \ndevastated by natural disaster in 2005 and into 2006.\n  In 2005, 59 South Dakota counties were included in Presidential or \nSecretarial emergency declarations as either primary or contiguous \ndisaster counties. These counties experienced natural disasters such as \ndrought, high winds, extreme heat, flash flooding, hail, prairie fires, \nspring frost, severe storms, and blizzards.\n  For example, 2005 marked the fourth consecutive year of experiencing \ndrought conditions in central South Dakota, including Hand, Hughes, \nHyde, Stanley, and Sully counties. Inadequate snowfall, meager spring \nrains, high temperatures, and desolating winds led to sparse pastures \nand a lack of forage crops necessary for feeding livestock. Without \nadequate precipitation, producers were forced to reduce the size of \ntheir livestock herds. Of the 57,500 acres planted or growing in \nStanley County, losses ranged from 35 to 70 percent. In Sully County, \n50 to 70 percent of 280,075 acres planted or growing were lost due to \ndrought conditions. Hyde County's corn, soybean, and sunflower crops \nexperienced yield losses ranging from 50 to 80 percent.\n  In southern South Dakota, Charles Mix County experienced much of the \nsame drought conditions. While drought typically wreaks havoc on an \narea over an extended period of time, one day of particularly extreme \ntemperatures and strong winds on top of severe drought can devastate \nalready struggling crops. On July 23, 2005, the temperature reached 114 \ndegrees Fahrenheit with 45-mile-per-hour winds. These conditions led to \na 60 percent loss of corn yields, 50 percent loss of soybean yields, \nand 30 to 35 percent of yield losses in sorghum, alfalfa, mixed forage, \nand grass. Neighboring county, Hutchinson County, experienced 100 \npercent loss of prevented corn and soybean yields and 50 percent loss \nof corn and soybean yields.\n  We are now in the middle of the 2006 production season and Farm \nService Agencies, FSA, in parts of the State report conditions edging \ntoward severe drought and fear that without adequate precipitation \nsoon, many counties will be faced yet again with another difficult year \nof production. Livestock producers are increasing supplemental feeding \nearly this year due to poor pasture conditions and lack of water in \ndams and dugouts. Farmers are left with very little to work with, as \nboth the topsoil and subsoil lack the necessary moisture to produce \noperation-sustaining crops. This cycle of drought conditions has \ncreated a new element of synergism in the agriculture industry, \ncompounding year upon year of devastating effects not only on \nproducers' pocketbooks, on livestock and land conditions.\n  Campbell County, in north-central South Dakota, is one among many \ncounties experiencing drought again this year. Entering into its fourth \nyear of drought conditions, with only 1.54 inches of rainfall to date \nfor 2006, Campbell County is currently 63 percent below the normal \nprecipitation for the area. Today, many water sources are dry due to \nbelow normal snowfall during the winter months yielding no runoff, and \nbelow normal rainfall this spring. In addition to drought, frost has \nforced producers to shorten grazing time on native pastures and native \nand tame greases.\n  In central South Dakota, drought is rearing its ugly head for the \nfourth and fifth consecutive years. Hand County is experiencing yet \nanother extremely dry year, with approximately 330 livestock producers \naffected and an estimated $210,000 needed in Emergency Conservation \nProgram, ECP, funds to correct the damage. In Lyman County, winter and \nspring wheat yields will likely yield zero to 40 percent of normal. Row \ncrops, which were planted into dry ground, are not germinating and will \nlikely fail unless adequate precipitation is received soon. While most \nlivestock producers in these areas have not liquidated as of yet, \nshould these conditions persist, they will be forced to sell their \nentire herd.\n  On the opposite end of the spectrum is Clay County, which experienced \na series of heavy rains, flooding, hail, and frost in 2005. Much of the \nalfalfa affected by the excessive rain incurred a significant quality \nloss, because most of the first cutting was not able to be marketed as \ndairy-quality hay. The majority of producers affected suffered a 20 to \n40 percent of yield losses, while 100 to 125 producers experienced \ngreater than 30 percent in losses. Of those with greater loss, some \nproducers received assistance from the FSA Farm Loan Division in order \nto keep their farm in operation.\n  Counties throughout the State have also been impacted by frost or \nfreezing temperatures. Haakon County, in western South Dakota, had \nfrost hit winter wheat and alfalfa crops in March of 2005, only to \nexperience freezing temperatures two months later. Eighty percent of \nyield losses affected the 15,800 acres of alfalfa and 10 to 20 percent \nof winter wheat yields were lost. Among other counties affected by \nfrost or freezing temperatures were Brown, Gregory, McPherson, Hyde, \nPotter, Brookings, Perkins, Clay, and Sully.\n  Dealing with winter storms is certainly not new to South Dakotans. \nHowever, from time to time the combination of unusually high winds, \nfreezing rain, and large snow accumulation results in the temporary \nparalysis of communities and agriculture operations. Not only did \nsevere winter weather in 2005 and the spring of 2006 take a toll on \nlivestock, but many producers were without electricity for days and \neven weeks. Producers' pocketbooks took an extra hit because of the \nhigh fuel costs it took to run generators around the clock.\n\n[[Page S5655]]\n\n  From November 27 through November 29, 2005, severe winter storms \nswept through much of eastern South Dakota. President Bush declared 42 \nprimary and contiguous counties as emergency designations. In Hamlin \nand Deuel Counties, 30 percent of producers' alfalfa and winter wheat \nwere lost in that particular blizzard.\n  Western South Dakota was hit with severe blizzard conditions on April \n18 and 19, 2006, dropping as much as 24 inches of snow. Harding, Meade, \nHaakon, and Butte counties were among those hardest hit by the spring \nblizzard, with the total estimate of livestock losses at approximately \n11,732. Harding County experienced the worst losses. According to the \nHarding County FSA office, 60 of the 300 producers contacted reported \nlosses totaling 2,500 cows and calves and 6,000 sheep. For one producer \nin northwest Harding County, about one-third of his herd died when \nbetween 450 and 500 of his sheep piled up against a fence and \nsuffocated. Butte County also sustained significant losses to their \nlivestock herd.\n  I briefly described the agricultural conditions South Dakota's family \nfarmers and ranchers have faced over the last year and a half. The \ncounties I described are merely a snapshot of the reality that our \nproducers experience following a natural disaster. In some cases, \ndisasters are limited to portions of one county, while other disasters \nspan large parts of the state, affecting all producers.\n  Every farmer or rancher knows that each production year is a gamble \nwith Mother Nature. Unfortunately, all too often most producers at some \npoint lose this gamble and suffer the devastating effects of a natural \ndisaster. I understand the financial and emotional hardships that this \nplaces on many family operations' struggle to survive. Because \nagriculture is the driving force behind South Dakota's economy, it is \ncrucial that producers receive the resources necessary to recover from \ntheir losses.\n  In response to the many natural disasters that producers throughout \nthe country have suffered, Senator Kent Conrad and I introduced the \nEmergency Agricultural Disaster Assistance Act of 2006 on March 16, \n2006. Our relief package would provide emergency production loss and \neconomic assistance to agricultural producers for losses sustained \nduring the 2005 production year. Assistance for crop production losses, \nlivestock assistance, supplemental nutrition, and economic disaster \nassistance to aid with rapidly-increasing production input costs are \nincluded in our bill. In addition, a number of provisions in the bill \naddress agricultural recovery in the areas affected by Hurricane \nKatrina.\n  Senators Kent Conrad, Byron Dorgan and I worked to fold our stand-\nalone bill into the larger spending bill, the Emergency Supplemental \nAppropriations Act, H.R. 4939. On May 4, 2006, the Senate passed the \n$109 billion emergency funding package, of which $3.9 billion would be \nused for agriculture disaster relief. As a negotiator in the conference \nconsideration of the bill, I fought to secure meaningful disaster aid \nfor producers. However, House leadership demonstrated their priorities, \nleaving America's family farmers and ranchers out to dry yet again. The \nconference report that was presented to the committee contained only \nmoney for Hurricane Katrina-related agriculture disaster--not a penny \nwas included to provide relief for the flooding and drought conditions \nthat have plagued so many of our producers in 2005.\n  While this administration insists that the 2005 crop year was \noutstanding, if not a record-breaking year, the disaster situations I \njust described indicate otherwise. This agreement was a raw deal for \nour producers and a raw deal for our rural communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/08/senate-section/article/S5655-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5655-S5656]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          FEDERAL INTEROPERABLE COMMUNICATIONS AND SAFETY ACT\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Despite the fact that there has been progress on the \nissue of interoperability, such as the transfer of much needed spectrum \nfor first responder communications and the allocation of $1 billion for \ninteroperability grants that passed last year, it is clear that \nincidents like Hurricane Katrina demonstrate that there remains more \nwork to be done.\n  What I am concerned about is that 5 years after 9/11, I do not \nbelieve that there has been the leadership role at the Federal level to \ngive this issue the full attention and high profile that it demands.\n  I believe we need an office at DHS that will be charged with \ncontinually analyzing, continually assessing, and continually thinking \nabout how to coordinate not only the Federal agencies that manage and \noperate communications systems, but the local and State governments, \nwho often have very different ideas of what interoperability means.\n  Additionally, we also need to give that office the resources and \nauthority it needs to carry out its mission.\n  We have ostensibly given the leadership role of one of the most \ncritical issues to emerge from 9/11 and Katrina to the SAFECOM Office \nwithin DHS. However, it is my understanding that this office has fewer \nthan 10 full-time employees and for all intents and purposes is buried \nwithin the DHS bureaucracy. While I understand that this office is \nheaded and staffed by dedicated professionals, how do we provide the \nFederal leadership necessary with fewer than 10 people?\n  SAFECOM, according to its own Director, needs more authority in \nfunding decisions and its interactions with other agencies.\n  We have got to get serious about this matter, and I believe that \nlegislation I have recently introduced, S. 3172, the Federal \nInteroperable Communications Act of 2006, takes us a step in that \ndirection and I would like to thank Senators Salazar and Durbin for \ncosponsoring my legislation.\n  My bill is not radical in how it is put together nor does it espouse \nto have the latest technology that will solve the interoperability \nproblem once and for all. But it does put forth a blueprint in how the \nFederal Government can utilize all of the assets at its disposal and \nensure that there is clear accountability and leadership on this issue \nat the Federal level.\n  It creates an interoperability czar who would report directly to the \nSecretary of Homeland Security. It also puts that czar in charge of a \ncentral interoperability office and gives it a clear mission, outlines \nresponsibilities and expectations, and allows it to get the resources \nit would need to carry out its mission.\n  It requires the development of a national strategy, which would \ninclude an inventory that identifies the channels and frequencies used \nin every Federal agency and keeps track of what is being used by the \nState and local officials, so that when first responders from the \nFederal Government or other jurisdictions respond to an incident, they \nwill know what frequencies and radios are being used.\n  This strategy sets clear benchmarks to ensure that we are constantly \nevaluating our capabilities and adjusting our strategies accordingly to \nchanges in threats, advancements in technology and other factors.\n  My bill would also help ensure that the money that we are spending \nnow on interoperability grants is being spent wisely and efficiently by \nensuring that the grant guidelines are consistent with the goals and \nmission of the Office of Emergency Communication and that grant \nrecipients have submitted a statewide interoperability plan or have \nadopted national consensus standards of how their platforms will work.\n  There have been dozens of first responders, emergency support \nproviders, and Federal, State, and local officials who have testified \nbefore Congress, where they have cited the need for consistency in \nFederal grant guidelines and clarity in the DHS mission for a national \nemergency communications plan, and my bill seeks to address those \nconcerns.\n  My bill also will help ensure that there is always an open line of \ncommunication between the State and local governments, the private \nsector, and the Interoperability Czar by creating regional working \ngroups that include virtually every entity with an interest in \ncommunications policy that can report the specific needs and progress \nin a region.\n  Finally, the bill also creates an Emergency Communications \nPreparedness Center which will be a consortium of all the Federal \nagencies that have\n\n[[Page S5656]]\n\nfocused on interoperable communications, namely the FCC, DHS, Commerce, \nDOD, and the Justice Department. I envision that this would be the \nFederal clearinghouse which would help ensure that these agencies which \nhave access to the latest technologies and innovative strategies in \ninteroperable communications can share and coordinate that information \nand technology to the benefit of the State and local agencies they work \nwith.\n  I also have provisions that will help facilitate the creation of a \nnational and interoperable alert warning system.\n  Basically, this bill boils down to providing the leadership needed at \nthe top level to ensure that the technologies, best practices, and \nresources are flowing to the men and women on the ground.\n  One of the key recommendations of the 9/11 Commission was to deploy \ninteroperable communications for all of our Nation's first responders. \nIndeed, this is an enormous, difficult, and complicated task, which \nrequires and demands the immediate and coordinated attention of our \nFederal Government. My legislation will help ensure that this critical \nissue gets the attention that it deserves.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/08/senate-section/article/S5656-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5656]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       HONORING TERRENCE J.

Mr. President, earlier this year Boston lost a \nlegendary political organizer, Mr. Ray Dooley, whose passion and \nintelligence lifted Massachusetts and everyone who worked with him. I \nask unanimous consent that the remarks I delivered at his memorial \nservice be printed in the Record:\n  The information follows.\n  Anne, Catroina, Conor, and Brian, in the time since your husband and \nfather was taken from all of us, but especially was taken too soon from \nyou who loved him best and needed him most, people across Massachusetts \nand Ireland have rightfully remembered Ray's social conscience, his \ndecency, his strength, his wisdom, and his judgment.\n  Each of these qualities of character ought to be especially \ncelebrated because they are as suddenly rare in public life as they \nwere abundant in Ray Dooley.\n  But they don't tell us the something about Ray which brought so many \nof us in this room together time and again, from movements to end an \nunjust war, to the march for civil rights, to Ray Flynn and City Hall, \nto hard fought, bare knuckled Senate races in 1984 and 1996 in which \nRay took center stage. I know better than anyone that they wouldn't \nhave ended in victory without him.\n  Ray lived out what Winston Churchill's political right hand R.A. \nButler knew: ``Politics is largely a matter of heart.''\n  But more than that even, Ray Dooley taught a generation of \npoliticians and political organizers that idealists could be tough as \nnails--and that there was nobility in fighting your heart out on the \npolitical field. He shattered anyone's illusion that liberals were \nfuzzy headed bleeding hearts out of the Ivy Tower who floated above the \nfray. Ray was never defensive about being `in politics'--he was proud \nof it, he wore his passion for the game on his sleeve. He was gutsy, \ndetermined, and in the finest sense of the phrase, a true believer. Ray \nshowed us all how to win a campaign and keep your conscience.\n  Harry Truman, who rose through the ranks came of age of Kansas City's\n\n[[Page S5657]]\n\nPendergast machine, was once asked if he minded being referred to all \nhis life as a `politician' while others were called `statesman.' Truman \nlaughed and said `they only call you a statesman when you're gone.'\n  I have no doubt Ray would prefer to be remembered as a political \norganizer--for he was one of the best and he gave his talent not only \nfor his candidates--and what a difference he made for us--but for the \ncommon good. And what a difference that made for our city, our state, \nand our country.\n  Ray had steadiness, toughness, and a willingness to ruffle feathers--\nalong with the force of character to tell candidates when they're \nwrong. More than once he said to me: ``John, cut the b.s.'' Ray, I hope \nI've finally learned.\n  He knew that in politics you can't make everyone happy and he saw \nthose on the other side as opponents, but never enemies. He fiercely \nwanted to defeat them, but never to destroy them.\n  He also had grit, and an instinct for when to tell a loud mouth to \npipe down, finally giving a reluctant activist at the end of the table \nthe confidence to speak up--and speak out. It was leadership, the art \nof politics at its best; he was a man who lived for others.\n  No, Ray was never afraid to be `in politics' because he knew it was \npolitics that got things done for the people whose cares were his \ncause--for the poor who lacked decent housing, for a city divided over \nrace, for women and gays and lesbians who only ask for the freedom to \nbe who they are, for workers who deserve decent wages, and, in Ireland, \nfor children whose rights and dignity had to be respected.\n  It wasn't cheering things on as they were that made the progress Ray \ndemanded, it wasn't high fallutin words that got these things done, it \nwas politics--it was deal-making--it was Ray Dooley and the language \nwas Dooley-speak.\n  Ray was a kind of quiet Pied Piper not unlike our old friend Michael \nVentresca. He loved underdogs. Tom Gallagher wasn't supposed to win, \nbut Ray proved the wise-guys wrong. Ray Flynn wasn't supposed to win, \nbut Dooley proved them wrong again. And I wasn't supposed to win--but \nRay believed, and I'm glad that together we proved him right. And in \nall these underdog fights, he loved being an odd couple political \nmatchmaker. It was Dooley and the best kind of politics in 1983 and \n1984 that surprised many and puzzled some when he helped to bring Ray \nFlynn and me together. It was Dooley who made it possible for Susan \nTracy to stand at the Jackson Mann School on primary day 1984 when \nRay's first victorious candidate Tom Gallagher came to my aid. It was \nRay who knew what it would mean to have a red ink stamp on all the \nKerry lit that read ``endorsed by Rep. Tom Gallagher.'' That was Ray \nDooley. It was the same Dooley style politics that showed up in Iowa in \n2004--when suddenly local reporters starting hearing about nuns \nphonebanking voters in Dubuque as part of Catholics for Kerry. I don't \nenvy the Bush supporter on the receiving end of that phone call!\n  That's how Ray Dooley won grassroots races: one house, one block, and \none precinct at a time. In an era when the art of politics is abused by \nsome in the profession and cynically dismissed by some in the press, \nit's important to remember--Ray showed how to do it right and for the \nright reasons.\n  Ray lived up to the words of John Kennedy--that politics is an \n``honorable profession.'' To Ray it was the worthiest of endeavors, a \njoyful profession. And through all the turbulence and temptations, he \nwas always above all something he prized in others--a man of honor.\n  But Ray wasn't just an individual force; he leaves behind an army he \nenlisted to carry on his mission. He built a farm team of political \nprofessionals who have become All Stars while staying true to \nprogressive causes. They carry a whole lot of Ray with them in the \nhopes and energy that fuels the work of Mary Beth Cahill, Patty Foley, \nMichael Whouley, Joe Newman, Kevin Honan, Susan Tracy, Marie Turley, \nHoward Leibovitz, and John Giesser. Anne, Catroina, Conor, and Brian \nmiss Ray in a way beyond measure; but his political family here in \nAmerica also misses a friend, a mentor, a surrogate father and adopted \nbrother.\n  With his humor, his doggedness, and his rare qualities of insight, \nRay fought and won great political battles. Campaign manager, chief \nstrategist, conscience--he was all this and more in politics. And he \nwas every bit as talented, committed, and resourceful in searching out \ntreatments for his illness while always thinking about how medical \nscience could help improve treatment for future cancer patients. He \nsaved his hardest fight for the race in which he was the ultimate \nunderdog. With humor, he laughed at his own mortality, sustaining those \naround him. Others might have reasonably given up, but not Ray. Why \ngive in to the long odds of beating a tough cancer when long odds had \nnever stopped him before? Knocked on his ass, Ray Dooley dusted himself \noff and kept punching. And each of us could learn a lot from that too.\n  So: our friend Ray was many things: an activist, a shameless \nidealist, an unapologetic progressive, a self-proclaimed liberal, a \nhumanitarian, and a globalist in the best sense of the word. But it \nwould be a mistake if his passing from man to unforgettable memory made \nany of us forget that Anne's husband, the father of Catroina, Conor, \nand Brian, was also the tough, go-to, level-headed, street-smart \nstrategic leader who lived and breathed politics in this proudly \npolitical city--and in Dooley-speak, he was damned good at it.\n  Ray, we gather here now one last time as your legion of lifelong \nfriends. Tomorrow and tomorrow, we will miss--you and so will the \nworld, for the injustices you would've righted, the hurts you would \nhave healed, and the great clashes that would've summoned you to arms. \nYour legacy is a generation that loves politics as much as you did and \nfights with the same heart, conviction, and passion that are your \nundying gift to us, your political family. You are buried in your \nbeloved Ireland, but for years to come your soul will be with us here \nin that other Irish place you loved, the city of Boston.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/08/senate-section/article/S5657-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5657-S5658]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO ROBERT EDWARD HOLROYD\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I wish to commemorate a man \nwho has made a significant impact on the State of West Virginia and on \nhis community--Robert Edward Holroyd is not only a dear friend of mine, \nbut the work he has done for our State has been beyond extraordinary. \nBob and I have been friends for a very long time and in addition to \nbeing a wonderful friend, he is also a counselor, and someone on whom I \noften rely for advice and wisdom.\n  Holroyd has been active in improving the medical practices for the \nState of West Virginia. He was one of the organizers of Princeton \nCommunity Hospital, where he served on the board until he became \ngeneral counsel of the hospital, a position he continues to hold. Also, \nhe is presently the chair of St. Luke's Hospital in Bluefield, WV and \nserves as chairman of the Mercer County 911 committee.\n  In 1981, Holroyd played a significant role in the opening of the \nPrinceton Health Care Center nursing home, which is celebrating its \n25th anniversary on June 16, 2006. Princeton Community Hospital opened \nas a general hospital on December 20, 1970, and was chartered as a \nnonprofit organization with its own board of directors to establish and \nplan for future health care centers. Since its inception, and thanks to \nthose like Holroyd, the hospital staff has grown from 13 physicians and \n125 employees to more than 100 doctors and 1,140 employees today as it \ncelebrates this milestone. With the addition of new equipment, the \nadoption of new concepts in health care delivery, and the expansion of \nthe facility, the hospital's well-trained and highly motivated \nprofessionals are able to provide quality health care services for the \ncitizens of Mercer and surrounding counties. The hospital's many \nspecialties and technological advancements place it on the leading edge \nof medical treatment in southern West Virginia.\n  Mr. Holroyd was born to the late Virginia Lazenby and the late Dr. \nFrank Jackson Holroyd on September 15, 1931, in Princeton, Mercer \nCounty, WV. Beginning in his youth in Mercer County,\n\n[[Page S5658]]\n\nHolroyd was a natural born leader, already making an impact in his \ncommunity. He was active in the First Baptist Church in Princeton, WV \nas well as the Boy Scouts of America, Troop 1, in which he attained the \nrank of Eagle Scout. While at Princeton High School, Holroyd was a \nmember of the nationally ranked Princeton High 1948-49 debate team. As \na result of his successes early in life, Holroyd received a 4-year \nscholarship to West Virginia University.\n  At West Virginia University, he majored in political science and \nspeech. During his tenure at the University, Holroyd left Morgantown \nand joined the United States Marine Corps during the Korean Conflict. \nHolroyd served on active duty for 3 years and served with special \nassignments to military police. In 1954, Holroyd became a Marine \nreservist and returned to Morgantown, WV to finish his undergraduate \nstudies, and pursue law school. He graduated with a law degree in 1958 \nand returned home to Princeton, WV, to practice law.\n  Holroyd's interest in politics blossomed after law school, and in \n1960, he became very active in President John F. Kennedy's primary \ncampaign in southern West Virginia. In Princeton, Holroyd was assistant \nprosecuting attorney from 1961-1964. In 1964, he was elected to the \nWest Virginia House of Delegates and served as prosecuting attorney of \nMercer County from 1965-1967. Besides working on President Kennedy's \ncampaign, Holroyd continued supporting the Democratic Party by serving \non the West Virginia State Democratic Executive Committee for two \nterms, as well as being a delegate to the Democratic National \nConvention in 1976.\n  Holroyd served West Virginia as a consultant to the Governor's \nCommittee on Crime and Delinquency and Correction and the International \nAssociation of Chiefs of Police. He was also an instructor on Criminal \nLaw and Procedure at West Virginia State Police Academy and West \nVirginia Basic Police Science Courses at Institute, WV. Holroyd also \nserved the Police force by being a guest instructor at Bluefield State \nCollege, Police Service Department and as an adjunct professor at \nMarshall University.\n  Throughout his community, Holroyd was a past member and officer in \nPrinceton's Junior Chamber of Commerce. He was an active member in the \nPrinceton Rotary Club, and is a current member of the Veterans of \nForeign Wars--VFW, American Legion, Elks, Moose, Mercer County and West \nVirginia's State Bar Associations.\n  Husband to Emilie Norwood Adams, father to Elizabeth, William and \nMary Jacqueline Holroyd, and grandfather to four, Holroyd has served \nhis family, his State, and his country. West Virginia is proud and \nhonored to say he represents the State, and I am proud and honored to \nsay he is a dear friend. West Virginia thanks him for his extraordinary \nservice and for his leadership some 25 years ago that make this \nanniversary possible for the Princeton Health Care Center nursing \nhome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/08/senate-section/article/S5658-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5658]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               100TH ANNIVERSARY OF LEMMON, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. THUNE.

A bill to amend the National Trails System Act relating to \nthe statute of limitations that applies to certain claims; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BOND. Today, I and Senator Jim Talent introduce the Easement \nOwners Fair Compensation Act of 2006. This bill will right a wrong done \nto property owners from whom the government took property without \ncompensation. It will also ensure that future property owners are \ntreated fairly when the government seeks to take their property through \neminent domain.\n  In 1992, the federal government confiscated property owned by 102 St. \nLouis County, Missouri residents through the Federal Rails to Trails \nAct. The taking imposed an easement on their property for a public \nrecreational hiking/biking trail. A trail easement was established on \ntheir property on December 20, 1992. After twelve years of bureaucratic \nfighting and delay, the Justice Department admitted the government's \ntakings liability and agreed to pay the property owners $2,385,000.85 \nfor their property, interest and legal fees.\n  However, two days before the U.S. Court of Claims was scheduled to \napprove the compensation agreement, the U.S. Federal Circuit issued the \nCaldwell decision regarding a rails-to-trails takings case in Georgia. \nThat decision established the statute of limitations for rails-to-\ntrails claims as the date of notice of interim trail use, not the date \nthe trail easement was imposed on the property, as previously assumed. \nUnder the new date, the statute of limitations on the St. Louis County \ntakings claim had expired. The Justice Department accordingly sought \ndismissal of the claims without payment and the Court of Claims judge \nagreed.\n  This bill is a Senate companion to H.R. 4581 introduced by \nRepresentative Akin and cosponsored by Representatives Carnahan and \nEmerson. The legislation sets the statute of limitations as beginning \non the date an interest is conveyed. It also allows for reconsideration \nof past claims dismissed because of this issue.\n  Without this bill, we will allow the wrong committed by the federal \ngovernment to stand. The federal government took private property, \nadmitted it owed the property owners over $2,000,000, and then refused \nto pay because of a technicality. That is no way to treat our citizens. \nThat is no way to run a rails-to-trails program. That is no way to \nencourage future recreational hiking and biking. I urge my colleagues \nto support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Mr. Coleman):\n  S. 3480. A bill to prevent abuse of Government credit cards; to the \nCommittee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing the Government \nCredit Card Abuse Prevention Act to address, in a comprehensive way, \nthe abuse, misuse, and fraud that has occurred with Government charge \ncards. Some people might ask, ``Why are you bothering with legislation? \nIs it that big of a problem?'' It is true that most Government \nemployees who are entrusted with a travel card or a purchase card do \nnot abuse it. It may also be true that the amount of money concerned is \nonly a fraction of any agency's annual budget. Well, when you have \nagencies like the Department of Defense with an over $500 billion \nbudget, even a small fraction means a lot of taxpayers' money. When I \nasked GAO to look into instances of waste, fraud, and abuse with \nGovernment charge cards, starting with the Department of Defense, we \nfound that purchase cards were used to spend taxpayer money for a \nsapphire ring, LA-Z-Boy reclining rocking chairs, and a dinner party \nfor a general at Treasure Island Hotel and Casino that included $800 \nfor alcohol. Government travel cards were used for gambling, sporting \nevents, concerts, cruises, and even gentlemen's clubs and legalized \nbrothels. Government travel cards are for official travel-related \nexpenses only, not tickets to a Dallas Cowboys game or a Janet Jackson \nconcert, but these are real examples of improper purchases GAO \nuncovered in reports I had requested. While travel cards are not paid \ndirectly with taxpayers' money like purchase cards, failure by \nemployees to repay these cards results in the loss of millions of \ndollars in rebates to the Federal Government. Also, when credit card \ncompanies are forced to charge off bad debt, they raise interest rates \nand fees on everyone else.\n  Based on what we found in DoD, I worked with GAO to uncover similar \nproblems in the U.S. Forest Service where one employee purchased five \ndigital cameras at a cost of $2,960, six computers for $6,019, three \npalm pilots totaling $736, jewelry worth $1,967, and $6,101 in other \nitems like cordless telephones, figurines, and Sony Playstations, all \nfor personal use and all at taxpayer expense. GAO subsequently found \nsimilar problems at\n\n[[Page S5662]]\n\nother agencies like the Federal Aviation Administration and the \nDepartment of Housing an Urban Development. I have cited just some of \nthe extreme examples, but there are many more instances where employees \npurchased items that were not needed by the agency or where a cheaper \nalternative would meet the purpose just as well. This occurred because \nof weak internal controls within the agencies and is something that \nclearly needs to be addressed governmentwide. Based on oversight from \nCongress, GAO, and agency inspectors general, the situation has \nimproved in many agencies and I am pleased that the Office of \nManagement and Budget has begun to bring about an improved control \nenvironment through direction contained in OMB Circular 123. However, \nthere is more to be done and my experience has convinced me that \nlegislation is necessary.\n  The Government Credit Card Abuse Prevention Act is largely based on \nthe recommendations by GAO regarding what controls are necessary to \nprevent the kinds of waste, fraud, and abuse we have uncovered. Since I \noriginally introduced this legislation in the last Congress, I have \ncollected input and ideas and worked to refine the bill to make it both \ncomprehensive and workable. The provisions in my bill are simply \ncommonsense internal controls that should be present in every Federal \nagency to prevent improper purchases. These include: performing credit \nchecks for travel cardholders and issuing restricted cards for those \nwith poor or no credit to reduce the potential for misuse; maintaining \na record of each cardholder, including single transaction limits and \ntotal credit limits so agencies can effectively manage their \ncardholders; implementing periodic reviews to determine if cardholders \nhave a need for a card; properly recording rebates to the Government \nbased on prompt payment; providing training for cardholders and \nmanagers; utilizing available technologies to prevent or catch \nfraudulent purchases; establishing specific policies about the number \nof cards to be issued, the credit limits for certain categories of \ncardholders, and categories of employees eligible to be issued cards; \ninvalidating cards when employees leave the agency or transfer; \nestablishing an approving official other than the purchase cardholder \nso employees cannot approve their own purchases; reconciling purchase \ncard charges on the bill with receipts and supporting documentation; \nsubmitting disputed purchase card charges to the bank according to the \nproper procedure; making purchase card payments promptly to avoid \ninterest penalties; retaining records of purchase card transactions in \naccordance with standard Government recordkeeping polices; utilizing \nmandatory split disbursements when reimbursing employees for travel \ncard purchases to ensure that travel card bills get paid; comparing \nitems submitted on travel vouchers with items already paid for with \ncentrally billed accounts to avoid reimbursing employees for items \nalready paid for by the agency; and submitting refund requests for \nunused airline tickets so the taxpayers don't pay for tickets that were \nnot used.\n  My bill would also provide that each agency inspector general will \nperiodically conduct risk assessments of agency purchase card and \ntravel card programs and perform periodic audits to identify potential \nfraudulent, improper, and abusive use of cards. We have had great \nsuccess working with inspectors general using techniques like data \nmining to reveal instances of improper use of government charge cards. \nHaving this information on an ongoing basis will help in strengthening \nand maintaining a rigorous system of internal controls to prevent \nfuture instances of waste, fraud, and abuse with government charge \ncards. In addition, my bill requires penalties so that employees who \nabuse Government charge cards cannot get away scotfree. In cases of \nserious misuse or fraud, the bill provides that employees must be \ndismissed and suspected cases of fraud will also be referred to the \nappropriate U.S. attorney for prosecution under Federal antifraud laws. \nHopefully this will send a clear message that such activity will not be \ntolerated so as to act as a deterrent for others.\n  I am proud of the oversight work that I do to uncover waste, fraud, \nand abuse, but sometimes I feel like Sisyphus, doomed to eternally roll \na boulder up a hill only to see it fall again. Instead of eternally \nlooking over the shoulder of agencies to find waste that should never \nhave occurred and then poking and prodding them to close the barn door \nafter the horse has gotten out, we need to put the internal controls in \nplace to make sure these problems don't happen in the first place. This \nbill will accomplish that for the Government charge card programs so \nthat American taxpayers can sleep soundly knowing that their money \nisn't being charged away by some bureaucrat. I hope my colleagues will \nsupport this commonsense measure and that it will be enacted into law \nin short order.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ENSIGN (for himself and Mr. Lieberman):\n  S. 3483. A bill to improve national competitiveness through enhanced \neducation initiatives; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, along with \nmy colleague from Nevada, Senator Ensign, the ``National Innovation \nEducation Act''. The intent of this bill is to enhance our science and \ntechnology talent base and improve national competitiveness through \nstrengthened education initiatives. Enhancing academic success, \nparticularly in the fields of science, technology, engineering and \nmath--often called the STEM disciplines--through innovative educational \nprograms will stimulate change and growth within elementary, secondary \nand postsecondary institutions, improve current educational \nopportunities for all students, allow graduates greater opportunity for \neconomic success and greater ability to successfully compete in the \nglobal market.\n  This bill proposes initiatives spanning the education spectrum that \nseek to improve quality instruction and access to STEM learning for all \nstudents. Recent recommendations from the Council on Competitiveness \nand The Augustine Commission at the National Academy of Sciences, among \nothers, target national concerns around the content and quality of K-16 \nin STEM disciplines, particularly with regard to minority and low-\nincome students, the need to stimulate innovation, and the need to \nenhance teacher preparation and professional development in the STEM \nfields.\n  An increasing number of researchers express alarm at the nearly one \nout of three public high school students who won't graduate and the \nfailure of our systems to adequately prepare high school graduates, and \nparticularly minorities, for success in college and the work place. \nAddressing the challenge of successfully thriving in a world of change, \nthe Council on Competitiveness examined the pressing issue of \nattracting more young Americans to science and engineering fields. \nCurrently, less than 15 percent of U.S. students have the prerequisite \nskills to pursue scientific or technical degrees in college. Only 5.5 \npercent of the 1.1 million high school seniors who took the college \nentrance exam in 2002 planned to pursue an engineering degree. And \nthere continues to be poor representation of women and minorities in \nthese fields. The National Academies report, ``Rising Above the \nGathering Storm,'' notes that amongst the U.S. science and technology \nworkforce 38 percent of PhDs were foreign born. Changes need to be \nenacted to not only increase the number of students pursuing math and \nscience degrees but to prepare them to pursue these degrees.\n  Indeed, numerous national reports in recent years have called for \nefforts to improve K-12 education, teacher preparation and professional \ndevelopment in the STEM areas. Recommendations include increasing the \nnumbers of postsecondary students pursuing careers in the areas of \nmathematics, science, engineering, and technology and increasing the \nnumbers of postsecondary students in the STEM fields who will then \npursue concurrent degrees in education. Increasing funding for not only \nSTEM education but STEM research has received strong recommendations as \nan important and timely approach to addressing improvements in \neducation and innovation. Finally, a critical factor to ensuring \nprogram success is the ability to engage and then hold students' \ninterests in the various STEM fields enough to encourage them to pursue \nSTEM careers.\n\n[[Page S5663]]\n\n  Our bill seeks to craft a comprehensive response to many of these \nissues, and includes the following provisions.\n  Title I--Improving Pre-kindergarten Through Grade 16, supplies a \nremedy to the critical issue of the disconnect existing between high \nschool outcomes and college expectations. Through the formation of \npartnerships between P-12 and higher education systems in the states--\nP-16 Commissions--academic success in postsecondary education becomes \nthe priority agenda item for reform. We anticipate that P-16 \nCommissions will bring about an increase in the percentage of \nacademically prepared students, particularly low-income and minority \nstudents, and a decrease in the percentage of college students \nrequiring remedial coursework, particularly with respect to math, \nscience, and engineering.\n  Many States across our country have already seen the wisdom of a P-16 \nCommission and have been working on goals and implementation. The \nresults, although preliminary for many States, are vastly encouraging. \nTitle I will provide support both to States with existing P-16 bodies, \nor States seeking to establish such commissions. It will give priority \nto the States also seeking to establish or enhance data systems. We \nhope that States will have an opportunity to craft a vision that will \nreach all students over time so that their educational pathway of \naccess to and success in college will be ensured.\n\n  Magnet schools have the capacity to create learning environments \ntailored to the interests and needs of its community and can offer a \nfocused curriculum capable of attracting substantial numbers of \nstudents of different racial backgrounds. Title II of our bill \nauthorizes the National Science Foundation to award grants to assist in \nthe promotion of innovation and competitiveness through the development \nand implementation of magnet school programs. These programs would \nencourage students to meet state academic content standards through the \ndevelopment and design of innovative educational methods, practices and \ncurricula that promote student achievement in STEM courses and \nencourage student enrollment in postsecondary institutions.\n  In addition, Title II authorizes NSF grants to elementary and middle \nschools creating pilot programs implementing innovation-based \nexperiential learning environments. Innovation-based experiential \nlearning is a teaching model that seeks to seed traditional technical \nstudies with new exposure to methods for creative thinking and \ntranslating ideas into practical applications. Such programs would \nlikely involve immersing students in hands-on experimentation that \nhelps students discover new concepts and use those concepts to solve \nreal-world problems.\n  The interrelated demands that mathematics and science education \nplaces upon schools to prepare both teachers and students must be \naddressed consecutively. Teachers need to be better prepared to teach \nSTEM topics across the board and students need to have access to \nteachers who are well versed in their content subjects.\n  Title III of our bill authorizes funding to increase the number of \ngraduates from postsecondary institutions with concurrent degrees in \neducation and STEM fields. This program is based on the successful \nUTeach model at the University of Texas at Austin. Encouraging science \nand math majors to concurrently pursue certification in the field of \neducation will help increase the number and quality of teachers in \nthese fields. The model program at the University of Texas has \nexperienced impressive success in attracting and keeping promising \nyoung STEM teachers. Our bill also calls for the establishment of \nTeacher Professional Development Institutes to promote innovative and \neffective approaches to improving teacher quality by providing \nprofessional development support for educators already in the \nclassroom. The Teacher Institute Model encourages collaboration between \nurban teachers and university faculty to improve student learning by \nenhancing teacher mastery of subject matter. It is based upon the model \nwhich has been in operation at Yale University in New Haven, CT for \nover 25 years.\n  Our Nation recognizes the pressing need to increase funding for STEM \nresearch and boost the number of students in undergraduate and graduate \nprograms pursuing mathematics and science degrees for our country's \ncontinued development, prosperity and security.\n  Within the final title of our bill, Title IV, NSF basic research \nfunding is doubled. NSF is authorized to expand funding for STEM \neducation through increased fellowships and trainee programs at the \nundergraduate and graduate level. A clearinghouse at the National \nScience Foundation of successful professional science master's degree \nprogram elements will be made available to postsecondary institutions \nas well as grants for developing pilot programs or improving current \nprograms. In addition the NSF Tech Talent program is reauthorized with \nincreased funding. This program provides competitive grants to \nundergraduate universities to develop new methods of increasing the \nnumber of students receiving degrees in science, math, and engineering. \nFinally, it is in our interest to examine and understand the emerging \nfield of services sciences, a multidisciplinary curriculum partnering \nscience, technology, engineering, and math with management and business \ndisciplines. To this end, the National Science Foundation will conduct \na collaborative study with leaders from institutions of higher \neducation to come to an understanding of how best to support this new \nfield.\n  Our National Innovation Education Act takes a broad and comprehensive \napproach to addressing national prosperity, security and our ability to \ncompete internationally with recommendations for enhanced education \ninitiatives in order to improve our national competitiveness. Improving \ncurrent education for all students will allow graduates greater \nopportunity for economic success and greater ability to successfully \ncompete in the global market. Our very Nation's future prosperity and \nsecurity depends upon our willingness as leaders to infuse education \nwith the requisite innovative vision that will inspire our youth to \nreach for goals that are achievable only beyond the ordinary bounds.\n  I urge my colleagues to act favorably on this measure. I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3483\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to \nextend the food labeling requirements of the Nutrition Labeling and \nEducation Act of 1990 to enable customers to make informed choices \nabout the nutritional content of standard menu items in large chain \nrestaurants; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the Menu \nEducation and Labeling Act of 2006, along with my colleague, Senator \nCantwell of Washington. Our bill would extend the successful nutrition \nlabeling that has been on packaged foods since the mid nineties to \ninclude foods at chain restaurants with 20 or more outlets and food \nsold in vending machines. The aim of this bill is to help Americans to \ntake better charge of their health by giving them the tools that they \nneed to make sound nutrition choices for themselves and their children.\n  It is no secret that poor health and the resulting health costs are \nmajor problems in the United States. According to the Centers for \nMedicare and Medicaid Services, total health care spending in the \nUnited States in 2004 was $1.8 trillion, and is expected to double by \napproximately 2014. Furthermore, chronic diseases, which are, in many \ncases preventable, account for approximately 75 percent of health care \ncosts annually.\n  Poor nutrition, diet-related chronic diseases, overweight, and \nobesity are public health threats of the first order. Heart disease and \nstroke are the first and third leading causes of death in the United \nStates and together, they account for about 40 percent of annual deaths \nin the United States. In addition, nearly two-thirds of adults are \neither overweight or obese.\n  But it is not just adults who are affected by poor diets. Kids are \nincreasingly at risk as well. According to the National Academy of \nSciences, over the last three decades, the obesity rate has doubled \namong preschoolers and adolescents, and tripled for kids between ages 6 \nand 11. For children born today, it is estimated that 30 percent of \nboys and 40 percent of girls will develop diabetes. Some scientists are \npredicting that the current generation of children may well be the \nfirst in American history to live shorter lives than their parents, \nlargely because of poor diets and diet-related chronic disease.\n  The issues are economic as well. The economic impact of chronic \ndisease can be seen in the annual costs associated with various \nconditions. Cardiovascular disease and stroke are estimated to cost \n$352 billion annually. The yearly economic impacts of obesity, cancer, \nand diabetes are estimated at $117 billion, $172 billion, and $132 \nbillion, respectively. So we need to promote common-sense steps to \nprevent these conditions. Increasing consumer knowledge is one of them.\n  This bill will give consumers a much-needed tool to make wiser \nchoices and achieve healthier lifestyles. Will individual steps like \nthis, by themselves, be enough to turn the tide of chronic disease and \npoor health? Of course not. But we must look for opportunities to give \nconsumers information they can use to take better control of their \nhealth.\n  In 1990, Congress passed the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act, \nNLEA, requiring food manufacturers to provide nutrition information on \nnearly all packaged foods. The impact has been extremely positive. Not \nonly do nearly three-quarters of adults read and use the food labels on \npackaged foods, but studies indicate that consumers who read labels \nhave healthier diets. It's time to extend this same opportunity to \nconsumers who want to make smart nutrition choices in restaurants and \nat vending machines.\n  More and more of Americans' food dollars are spent in restaurants. \nRestaurants play an increasingly important role in Americans' diet and \nhealth. But restaurants were excluded from the NLEA.\n  Today, American adults and children consume a third of their calories \nat restaurants. Nutrition and health experts say that rising caloric \nconsumption and growing portion sizes are causes of overweight and \nobesity. We also know that when children eat in restaurants, they \nconsume twice as many calories as when they eat at home. Consumers say \nthat they would like nutrition information provided when they order \ntheir food at restaurants. However, while they are fully informed about \nthe nutrition content of food available in supermarkets, consumers at \nrestaurants are almost totally in the dark, left to guess about what is \nin the foods they are ordering. This legislation seeks to remedy this \nso that consumers can make the same informed choices in a restaurant \nthat they are currently able to make in the grocery store.\n  This legislation requires restaurants to convey only minimal but \nessential information, including calories, grams of fat and trans fat, \nand milligrams of sodium for each serving. In addition, it recognizes \nthere may be inadvertent human errors that affect things such as \nvariations in serving sizes and food preparation, so the bill directs \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services,\n\n[[Page S5670]]\n\nin promulgating regulations, to allow for some reasonable leeway. And \nfinally, it recognizes that menus change from time to time, so the \nlabeling requirements would not apply to daily specials or to temporary \nmenu items. In short, we are not trying to require information for \nevery individual thing that is made available at restaurants, but we \nare asking restaurants to provide clear and consistent information on \nthose menu items that are broadly and consistently available.\n  There are some who will say this is impractical and an extraordinary \nburden on restaurants. I disagree. I have been through this debate \nbefore, when Congress was considering the NLEA. We heard the same \nparade of arguments and horror stories. But the law was passed anyway \nand, lo and behold, the sky did not fall. To the contrary, businesses \nmade simple adjustments. Americans got access to the necessary \ninformation. It had positive health benefits. And at the end of the \nday, things worked out just fine.\n  In fact, you can even look at the Senate to see the potential success \nof this law. A couple of years ago, I wrote to the administrator of the \nSenate cafeteria, to which I often send out for lunch. I simply \nrequested that the cafeteria, if possible, provide nutrition \ninformation on standard menu items. Not more than a couple of months \nlater, printed handouts were available in the cafeteria with detailed \nnutrition information on the daily menu. This is not McDonald's, Burger \nKing or Arby's. This is the Senate cafeteria. And by gosh, if the \nSenate cafeteria can do this without an undue burden, then surely so \ncan the largest restaurant chains in the country.\n  I believe that most Americans want to take more charge of their \nhealth. They want to make the best decisions for both themselves and \nfor their children. But it is hard to do so without nutrition \ninformation upon which they can base their informed decisions. This \nlegislation seeks to give Americans the information they want and need. \nThis will be a simple but very important step in the right direction, \nhelping ourselves and our children to live healthier, happier, and more \nproductive lives. I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting the \nMenu Education and Labeling Act of 2006.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for Mr. Rockefeller (for himself, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. \n        Baucus, Mr. Leahy, and Ms. Stabenow)):\n  S. 3486. A bill to protect the privacy of veterans, spouses of \nveterans, and other persons affected by the security breach at the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs on May 3, 2006, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today's headline is sad and \nstunning. The VA Secretary now reports that 2.2 million active-duty \nmilitary personnel were also exposed in the massive security breach at \nVA on May 3. This means that 1.1 million active-duty military \npersonnel, 430,000 National Guard members and 645,000 reservists are \nexposed to potential identity theft. The brave men and women, who are \nserving and protecting our country, are not being protected by their \nown government.\n  This is deeply disturbing and we owe each servicemember and veteran \nreal support to protect their financial information.\n  I have revised my legislation, S. 3176, the Veterans' Privacy \nProtection Act, to expand coverage to our military personnel. I am \nproud to have the cosponsorship of Senators Jeffords and Baucus.\n  Every American has the justifiable expectation that the Federal \nGovernment will protect their private personal information--information \nthat they are required to provide to Federal agencies. It is a basic \nand fundamental responsibility of government to make sure that this \nsensitive data is handled appropriately, accessed only by authorized \npersonal, and used only for intended purposes.\n  On May 22, the Department of Veterans Affairs, VA, announced that \ncomputer disks containing as many as 26.5 million veterans' personal \ninformation were stolen from an employee who had taken the information \nhome. I, along with many of my colleagues, am outraged at this enormous \nlapse in security. The VA has an obligation to make sure that veterans \nand military personnel are not harmed because of the agency's failure \nto protect sensitive personal data.\n  This information includes social security numbers and dates of birth, \nthe underpinnings of almost all of our financial information. In the \nwrong hands, this information can be used to steal a person's identity \ncausing substantial harm. All of us have constituents who have been \nvictims of identity theft. When a person's identity is stolen, it can \nhave devastating financial consequences for that person and that \nfamily. Even if the financial harm is minimal, it often takes years to \nclear your name. Plus, veterans and military families must live with \nthe uncertainty about the financial records.\n  I understand that the VA, FBI and local law enforcement are working \non the investigation, but Congress must also conduct a thorough \ninvestigation into how this security breach occurred. I want to know \nwhy the VA waited almost three weeks for its first announcement. I want \nto know why it took another two weeks to compare files and realize that \n2.2 million military personnel were also exposed.\n  In my opinion, it is inexcusable that veterans and military were not \nnotified immediately that their personal information had been stolen \nand were not given any guidance as to the steps they should take to \nprotect themselves from identity theft. I understand the VA inspector \ngeneral has cited the agency for poor security policies and procedures. \nCongress must also begin a comprehensive review of the agency's \nsecurity protocols and policies and force the agency to adopt stricter \nsecurity measures to make sure that the personal data our veterans are \nrequired to provide the agency is not ever again at risk.\n  It is for this reason that I am reintroducing the Veterans' and \nMilitary Privacy Protection Act today. Although all Federal agencies \nneed comprehensive data privacy policies, this is a targeted bill to \naddress the security breach at the VA on an urgent basis.\n  Congress has required the Federal Trade Commission to address \nidentity theft and its consequences. The agency has taken an aggressive \napproach in combating this devastating crime. My bill would require the \nFederal Trade Commission to develop a hotline explicitly for veterans \nand military personnel to provide the information, counseling, and help \nnecessary to allow each person to protect himself from the loss of \npersonal data.\n  At this point, our legislative response must cover all 28.7 million \nveterans and servicemembers that the VA believes may have had their \npersonal information compromise. My bill would make it easier for them \nto request a long-term credit alert for their records so credit \nagencies are aware that their personal information could be being used \nby others. It is my understanding that a security freeze on an \nindividual's record can have a modest cost, and VA has the obligation \nto cover the costs of this enormous security breach.\n  Finally, my bill requires the General Accountability Office to \nevaluate the VA response to this incident and to analyze the agency's \nsecurity protocols. I believe that an independent investigation could \ngenerate a number of recommendations to improve the security of \npersonal information not just in the VA but in all Federal agencies.\n  The VA has exposed millions of veterans and military to identity \ntheft and potential financial problems. It is inconceivable to me how \nany Federal agency could have let this happen, and how the \ninvestigation and followup could be so haphazard. We all have heard the \nstories during the past year regarding massive breaches of private and \nconfidential data by private entities. The Federal Government acted \nquickly to respond to these breaches and now it must act just as \nquickly if not more so to address its own failings. My bill is a \ncritical step in providing the necessary assistance that millions of \nveterans and servicemembers may require, and I urge my colleagues to \nact on it with the urgency this situation demands.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself and Mr. Pryor):\n\n[[Page S5671]]\n\n  S. 3487. A bill to amend the Small Business Act to reauthorize and \nimprove the disaster loan program, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, June brings the beginning of the 2006 \nAtlantic Hurricane season, and according to the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration, we can expect it to be a busy one. The \nadministration is predicting 13 to 16 named storms, with as many as 4 \nto 6 predicted to become major hurricanes of category three strength or \nhigher.\n  As our gulf coast communities learned last fall, it only takes one of \nthese storms to utterly destroy the homes, businesses and lives of \nmillions of Americans. We owe it to the victims of Hurricanes Katrina, \nRita and Wilma, as well as to the unsuspecting victims of future \ndisasters, to fix the Federal disaster loan program and build it to be \nresponsive to the needs of disaster victims.\n  That's why I am introducing the Small Business Disaster Loan \nReauthorization and Improvement Act of 2006. This bill seeks to improve \ncoordination between responding agencies in the immediate aftermath of \na disaster. The priority of first responders should be addressing the \nneeds of victims, and the laws establishing disaster response should \nallow for maximum agency collaboration in addressing those needs.\n  To this end, we have directed the Administrator of the Small Business \nAdministration and the Director of the Federal Emergency Management \nAgency to coordinate disaster assistance application periods when \npossible. The Small Business Administration is directed to address any \ninconsistencies between the Federal regulations and the \nadministration's standard operating procedures that govern the disaster \nloan program.The Administrator is also directed to work to the maximum \nextent practicable to gain speedy access to all relevant tax records \nfor loan applicant consideration, and when considering applications, is \ndirected to consider an applicant's credit rating from the day prior to \nthe disaster's occurrence.\n  The Comptroller General is directed to study the current disaster \nassistance application and referral process that has resulted in an \napproval rate of only 35 percent of total disaster loan applicants. The \nAdministrator is also directed to report on how this process can be \nimproved. To increase awareness of available disaster loan assistance, \nthe bill directs the Administrator to develop a proactive marketing \nplan that will get information on disaster loans in the hands of those \nwho need it. The bill includes an additional study to be conducted by \nthe Comptroller General on industries that may have difficulty \naccessing disaster loans.\n  In addition to reauthorizing the disaster loan program for a period \nof 3 years beginning in 2007, this bill provides the increased capital \nthat homeowners and small business owners need and currently have \ntrouble accessing following a major disaster. A presidential \ndeclaration of catastrophic national disaster will allow the \nAdministrator to offer economic injury disaster loans to adversely \naffected business owners beyond the geographic reach of the disaster \narea. In addition, private lenders are encouraged to make disaster \nloans through the 7(a) and 504 lending programs with reduced fees, and \nthe Administrator is authorized to enter into agreements with private \ncontractors in order to expedite loan application processing for direct \ndisaster loans.\n  Disaster victims are often in need of capital prior to when \ntraditional assistance programs are available. To address this need, \nthis bill establishes a process for providing Federal bridge loans, \nallowing States to redirect funding previously designated for Community \nDevelopment Block Grants and use these funds to provide bridge loans \nand grants to disaster victims. Having this waiver in place will allow \nStates to ensure that victims have the speedy access to capital while \nthey wait for alternative sources of assistance.\n\n  Non-profit entities working to provide services to victims should be \nrewarded and given access to the capital they require to continue their \nservices. To this end, the Administrator is authorized to make disaster \nloans to nonprofit entities, including religious organizations.\n  So that businesses are not limited during major disasters by a loan \ncap that is not sufficient to meet their needs, the bill increases the \naggregate amount of loans available to $10,000,000 during a declared \nmajor disaster or a catastrophic national disaster.\n  This bill strengthens the Stafford Act by requiring a 10 percent goal \nfor local firms to participate in the recovery and reconstruction \neffort. The bill also encourages the utilization of expedited \nprocurement tools for small, small disadvantaged, service-disabled, and \nhistorically underutilized businesses.\n  Construction and rebuilding contracts being awarded are likely to be \nlarger than the current $2 million threshold currently applied to the \nSBA Surety Bond Program which helps small construction firms gain \naccess to contracts. This bill increases the guarantee against loss for \nsmall business contracts up to $5 million and allows the Administrator \nto increase that level to $10 million, if deemed necessary.\n  The bill also allows faster payments to small firms in order to \nincrease their ability to gain access to bonds. To make bonding more \nattractive to surety providers in the disaster area, the Administrator \nmay wave fees for sureties offering bonding in the disaster area and \nallows the sureties to use the State-approved rates for bonds awarded \nin the disaster area.\n  The bill also provides for small business development centers to \noffer business counseling in disaster areas, and to travel beyond \ntraditional geographic boundaries to provide services during declared \ndisasters. To encourage small business development centers located in \ndisaster areas to keep their doors open, the maximum grant amount of \n$100,000 is waived.\n  So that Congress may remain better aware of the status of the \nadministration's disaster loan program, this bill directs the \nadministration to report to the Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship of the Senate and to the Committee on Small Business \nof the House of Representatives regularly on the fiscal status of the \ndisaster loan program as well as the need for supplemental funding. The \nadministration is also directed to report on the number of Federal \ncontracts awarded to small businesses, minority-owned small businesses, \nwomen-owned businesses, and local businesses during a disaster \ndeclaration.\n  Many small businesses depend on the contributions of America's \nmilitary reservists, and have been struggling through the months that \nthese brave men and women have served their country through active \nduty. This bill authorizes the Administrator to provide grants to the \nsmallest of these firms to assist them as they seek to remain open.\n  Gas prices continue to soar, and fuel dependent small businesses are \nstruggling with the cost of energy. This bill provides relief to small \nbusiness owners during times of above average energy price increases, \nauthorizing energy disaster loans through the Small Business \nAdministration and the United States Department of Agriculture to \ncompanies dependent on fuel.\n  Residents of the gulf coast continue to rebuild from last year's \nhurricane season, and they do so despite the slow and inadequate \nresponse from their Federal Government. By increasing access to capital \nfor small businesses suffering as a result of a disaster, and by \nensuring that Federal agencies charged with disaster response are doing \ntheir jobs in a coordinated manner that puts the needs of victims \nfirst, we can ensure that the Federal Government is better prepared to \nrespond to future disasters.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/08/senate-section/article/S5671-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5671-S5672]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 505--AUTHORIZING THE TAKING OF A PHOTOGRAPH IN THE \n                  CHAMBER OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE\n\n  Mr. FRIST (for himself and Mr. Reid) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Res. 98\n\n       Whereas, for 3,000 years, Jerusalem has been the holiest \n     city of Judaism and the focal point of Jewish religious \n     devotion;\n       Whereas Jerusalem is also considered a holy city by members \n     of other religious faiths;\n       Whereas, from 1948 to 1967, Jerusalem was a divided city, \n     and Israeli citizens of all faiths, as well as Jewish \n     citizens of all countries, were denied access to certain holy \n     sites;\n       Whereas, in 1967, Jerusalem was reunited by Israel during \n     the conflict known as the ``Six Day War'';\n       Whereas, since 1967, Jerusalem has been a united city, and \n     persons of all religious faiths have been guaranteed full \n     access to holy sites within the city;\n       Whereas this year marks the 39th year that Jerusalem has \n     been administered as a unified city in which the rights of \n     every ethnic and religious group are protected;\n       Whereas, in 1990, the Senate and House of Representatives \n     overwhelmingly adopted S.
