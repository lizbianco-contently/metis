Also, we have set out a time for Tuesday and Wednesday of this \ncoming week. We will not have any votes during Monday's session, but \nSenators can expect a very busy week on that deficit reduction package. \nI will have more to say about the course of next week later today and \nwill outline the voting schedule, as we know it, a little bit later \nthis morning.\n  I congratulate, once again, Chairman Specter and Senator Harkin for \ncompleting the work on the Labor-HHS appropriations bill last night. \nThat was the final of our 12 appropriations bills to be considered by \nthe Senate. Senator Cochran has done a tremendous job throughout the \nappropriations process, and we thank him for his efforts and his \ncommittee members for shepherding the bills through.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/28/senate-section/article/S12039-8", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12039-S12040]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             RECONCILIATION\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, on Monday we begin consideration of the \ndeficit reduction bill, a bill that goes by the title of a \nreconciliation bill. Indeed, it has been 8 years since we have \naddressed spending on a reconciliation bill, a critically important \nbill. It may well be the most important piece of fiscal legislation we \nwill debate. I fully expect it will be enacted this year. For those who \nmay watch this debate, I should be clear that the bill we will debate \nis focused on one piece of the Federal budget, not the entire Federal \nbudget. It is, however, a major piece of the budget, mandatory \nspending. That word ``mandatory,'' sometimes referred to as entitlement \nspending, represents about $1.4 trillion or 56 percent of overall \nFederal spending this year. It will continue to grow in the future, \nparticularly as that demographic shift occurs, as the baby boomers \nbegin to travel through our system in 2008.\n  Mandatory spending, entitlement spending, encompasses a whole range \nof programs familiar to my colleagues--Social Security, Medicare, \nMedicaid, Federal-civilian military retirement, student loans, TRICARE, \nfoster care, child nutrition, SSI, unemployment insurance, farm price \nsupport programs, veterans disability, and the list goes on. If Federal \nspending is to be controlled--and it absolutely must be controlled--\nover time, these programs are going to have to be addressed. They are \ngoing to have to be reformed.\n  Over the last 5 years, mandatory entitlement program spending has \ngrown at an annual rate of over 7.1 percent. That is three times faster \nthan the overall growth in our economy. It simply cannot be sustained. \nThe result is a greater share of our national economy's productive \ncapacity, that proportion of our productive capacity, is being shifted \ntoward those programs. We have to find a balance. It is incumbent upon \nus to do so.\n\n  Under the procedures laid out by the Budget Act for considering this \ndeficit reduction legislation that we will have on the floor beginning \nMonday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday of next\n\n[[Page S12040]]\n\nweek, Social Security, which is the largest of these mandatory \nprograms, is set aside. It cannot, nor should it be, considered in this \nlegislation. It cannot be. So realistically, the universe of Federal \nspending that we will be dealing with over the next week is limited to \n33 percent or about a third of all Federal spending. That is where the \nfocus will be.\n  The deficit reduction legislation we will be considering over the \nweek is the culmination of a process that began in February, when the \nPresident gave us his budget. The President's budget included proposals \nto reduce the Federal deficit over the next 5 years by slowing the \ngrowth in Federal spending in this area of the Federal budget. Again, \nof the overall Federal budget, we are talking about a third of it that \nwe will be addressing. The President's budget came over and said: We \nare going to slow that spending growth by $26 billion.\n  The congressional budget resolution we adopted back in April \nsimilarly agreed that slowing that growth--and there is still going to \nbe growth--in mandatory spending was an essential part of achieving not \nonly deficit reduction but, not unrelated, being able to sustain \neconomic growth. We want to achieve deficit reduction, but we want to \nbe able to sustain economic growth. So to accomplish that goal, our \n2006 budget laid out a process that has not been used in about 8 years. \nI believe it was in 1997 that we last had a spending deficit reduction \npackage, a reconciliation process used on the spending side of the \nequation. It has been 8 years since we have used this process.\n  The budget we adopted directed eight authorizing committees in the \nSenate and in the House to make changes in laws within their \njurisdiction to achieve a total of $34.7 billion in savings over the \nnext 5 years. That is what the budget told those eight authorizing \ncommittees to come up with. Subsequent to passage of our budget in the \nspring, we have had big, unanticipated spending demands that resulted \nfrom the worst hurricane season in the Nation's history. All of that \nplaced added attention on spending and on Government spending. We \nresponded to that appropriately, in a bipartisan way, by agreeing to \ndelay consideration of the reconciliation process in early September so \nthat we could focus on hurricane response and on the demands and on \nwhat the people who have been so directly affected by those hurricanes \ndeserve. We have addressed the needs of the gulf coast families \naffected by the storms. We continue to address them. We did, indeed, in \nlegislation last night. We will continue to do so in the future.\n  Indeed, within this reconciliation legislation, while at the same \ntime meeting the goal of deficit reduction, we do so while also \nproviding the needed medical attention, the education attention, and \nother Government benefits to the victims of those hurricanes. We also \nrecognize that because of the additional spending demands being placed \non the Federal Government, we needed to do more in terms of deficit \nreduction itself, the deficit reduction we defined pre-Katrina, that we \ndid need to do more.\n  In late September, I, along with the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, wrote to the chairmen and ranking members of the eight \nreconciled committees, the committees that will be responding with \ntheir proposals next week, asking them each to consider how they could \ncome up with increased savings.\n  I am proud of the effort put forth by each of these eight committees. \nThey have come forth with specific recommendations. Now that is what we \nare bringing to the floor of the Senate. They increased deficit \nreduction by nearly 13 percent so rather than $35 billion, as required \nby our initial budget proposal from the early part of this year, the \nlegislation approaches about $40 billion, just under but almost $40 \nbillion in savings. I thank and applaud members of the various \nauthorizing committees who have come forth with those increased \nsavings.\n  I would be remiss if I did not point out that in many instances, the \nadditional savings were accomplished on a bipartisan basis in many of \nthe committees. Forty billion dollars in savings over the next 5 years \nis less than 2 percent of the $2.6 trillion in mandatory spending that \nwill occur over the next 5 years. It is tough to accomplish that. We \nwill be debating that over the course of the week. But in truth, it is \nonly 2 percent of the $2.6 trillion in mandatory spending that is going \nto occur over the next 5 years.\n  There will be some who think this legislation does not go far enough \nto reduce spending. I personally would not disagree. There will be \nothers who will come into my office saying it goes too far. I do \ndisagree with them. Both proponents will have an opportunity, over the \ncourse of consideration of the bill, to amend the legislation to \nachieve whatever their objectives might be. I will be laying out that \nschedule later today.\n  Regardless of that debate, no one will deny that this is the first \nreal effort in 8 years to slow down growth in mandatory spending. The \nchairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Gregg, and the ranking \nmember, and the eight reconciled committees are to be congratulated for \nmaking the tough and difficult decisions they had to in bringing this \nbill to the Senate floor.\n  Finally, in balancing deficit reduction with all of the other demands \nthat come to this body, the committees were careful not to place the \nburden of deficit reduction on the most vulnerable in our society. As a \nmember of the HELP Committee, I personally thank Chairman Enzi and \nRanking Member Kennedy for meeting their deficit reduction requirement, \nwhile at the same time providing a 10-percent increase in average \ngrants to low-income students, with additional assistance for those \nstudents working toward a degree in math, science, engineering, and \ntechnology. While that committee achieved over $16 billion in deficit \nreduction by eliminating banker and lender windfalls and special \npayments, it redirected some of those savings toward needy students.\n  Similarly, the Finance Committee, in meeting its instruction to \nachieve $10 billion in deficit reduction, was able to redirect \nadditional savings toward providing such things as $1.9 billion to \nMedicaid recipients in the Gulf Coast States, nearly $1 billion to \nexpand Medicaid benefits to severely disabled children through the \nFamily Opportunity Act, nearly $100 million for the SCHIP program, and \nextension of expiring provisions that will provide over $200 million to \nrural hospitals and sole community centers.\n  Another committee, the Commerce Committee, was able to direct a \nportion of its deficit reduction savings toward implementing E-9-1-1 \nemergency services as well as directing $200 million toward coastal \ndisaster assistance.\n  All of this is a first good positive step toward real mandatory \nspending reduction. Additional steps are being taken and will be taken \nto control the growth in the nonsecurity appropriations as we bring the \n2006 appropriations process to a conclusion over the next couple of \nweeks as well.\n  We will apply fiscal discipline through the actions we take these \ncoming weeks and we will continue to promote those policies that \nprotect the needy while at the same time creating jobs and ensuring a \ngrowing economy.\n  Let us work together to keep America moving forward. I look forward \nto the debate next week and doing just that, working together to keep \nthis country moving in a positive direction.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/28/senate-section/article/S12040-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12040]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, it is not often you see a spotlight shine on \nthe differences between the two parties, between the Democrats and \nRepublicans. This debate is that spotlight. This budget that is \nattempted to be reconciled is, as I have said on a number of occasions, \nan immoral budget. It hurts the poor and middle class. It makes all the \nrewards to those people who are already fat as a result of our system.\n  The Republican budget is fiscally irresponsible. It sets forth the \nwrong values and misplaced priorities. President Bush has the worst \nfiscal record in the Nation's history, taking a surplus when he was \nelected President from some say\n\n[[Page S12041]]\n\nas much as $7 trillion over 10 years, and to have squandered it in 5 \nyears to where now we have an $8 trillion deficit. That is a pretty big \nturnaround. Record surpluses we had have been turned into historic \ndeficits. This immoral budget that is attempted to be reconciled will \nincrease the deficits by $30 billion more.\n  Following the budget choices made by the Republicans in this budget, \nin 5 years the deficit will increase to over $11 trillion from its now \n$8 trillion. Simply the wrong choices have been made with this budget.\n  This Senate reconciliation spending bill makes the wrong choices. It \nincreases the burdens on seniors in a number of ways, not the least of \nwhich is increasing Medicare Part B premiums, cuts health care \ngenerally by $27 billion in Medicare and Medicaid cuts, cuts \nagriculture, cuts support--that is directed at farmers--by $3 billion.\n  In my little town of Searchlight, NV, something called the Farmers \nHome Administration came in and helped build 28 units of senior housing \nfor the poor. They are, frankly, the nicest homes in town. We don't \nhave these programs anymore, but those 28 units in Searchlight only \nbecome vacant when someone dies. Once someone gets in there, qualifies \nto get in there, they are there until they die. There is a waiting list \neven in the little community of Searchlight. It is so long people no \nlonger even get on the list. But this budget the Republicans are \npushing down the throats of the American people reduces availability of \naffordable housing. There will be no more places such as that in \nSearchlight. They are cutting that.\n  But they are going to drill in Alaska. Remember, we cannot produce \nour way out of the problems we have with energy. America has, counting \nANWR, less than 3 percent of the oil reserves in the world--less than 3 \npercent. But they finally have been able to accomplish under this \nreconciliation drilling in Alaska, in this pristine wilderness.\n  I would think the President would be better off looking at \nalternative energy, giving incentives for people to develop energy from \nthe sun and wind, geothermal, biomass. No, it is not in this budget. \nMore efficient automobiles maybe. Production of natural gas during the \nlast 5 years has been stable. Right now our reserves are the same as \nthey have been for 5 years. But the people controlling oil, these oil \nand gas companies, are doing well. For someone heating their home with \nnatural gas--and that is almost 50 percent of the American people--the \ncost will go up 48 percent this year. Maybe the President should spend \na little time on that.\n  This budget provides tax breaks for multimillionaires and special \ninterests. Reconciliation paves the way for budget-busting tax breaks, \nincluding capital gains and dividend tax breaks, that will benefit \nspecial interests and the wealthy. Tax breaks exceed spending cuts by \nmore than $30 billion in this immoral budget. Well over a majority, \nsome 55 percent of the benefits of capital gains and dividends, go to \nthose with incomes of more than $1 million. The average benefit of \nthese tax breaks for those with incomes of more than $1 million will be \napproximately $36,000. Those people making between $50,000 and $200,000 \nget $112. Those with incomes under $50,000 will get $6--$6, compared to \nmillionaires getting $36,000. It doesn't seem quite fair to me.\n  Is this the reason the leadership of the Protestant churches in this \ncountry has called this an immoral budget? It could be one strong \nreason.\n  But the House--they haven't been working much lately because they \nhave been trying to figure out how to cut even $15 billion more. They \ncan't quite get the votes together, but they are going to try again \nnext week. The House plan cutting $15 billion, we are told, would \ninclude more in student loan cuts, food stamp cuts, cuts in child \nsupport enforcement and foster care cuts, deeper and more problematic \ncuts in health care. Other priority reasons in this country should come \nfirst. Rather than harming the vulnerable while providing special tax \nbreaks to the rich increasing the deficit, we should address the \nNation's most urgent problems.\n  I have talked about natural gas. That is only one way to heat your \nhome. But gasoline for your car, that is what we should be focusing on. \nOil companies this year will make $100 billion in profits--$100 billion \nin profits. I say that is too much. I say it is time this Congress, \nrather than pushing forward on this immoral budget, should take a look \nat the immoral and obscene profits these companies are making, maybe \ntake a look at a windfall profits tax or maybe allow the FTC to do \nsomething about this price gouging. These rising energy costs are \nburdening families, businesses, and farmers.\n  We have said there are programs we need to take a look at. Katrina \nvictims are still victims. We as a Congress have not provided them the \nhelp they need.\n  I haven't even mentioned the war on Iraq we should be spending some \ntime here on the Senate floor talking about.\n  Can we do better? Yes, America can do better. Have we done better? \nYes, America has done better. During the Clinton years--during the last \n3 years he was President--we were paying down the debt. We paid down \nthe debt by half a trillion. We were spending less money than we were \ntaking in. Yes, it can be done. And, yes, we are going to spend this \nnext week on this budget that is fiscally irresponsible, giving the \nCongress direction in values that are wrong. All across this \nreconciliation are misplaced priorities. We can do much better. We have \ndone better. And again the spotlight shines on the difference between \nthe two parties here as not often seen. But here we will see it next \nweek, the difference between the two parties.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I yield back to the leader.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/28/senate-section/article/S12041-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12041-S12042]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, I rise in morning business to pay tribute \nto a great Georgian, a great American, a personal friend of mine, and a \ngreat citizen of Cobb County. In about 11 days our county will come \ntogether to pay tribute to this great individual and I wanted today on \nthe Senate floor to memorialize for a moment the contributions of Earl \nSmith. For me it is a particular point of personal pride and it is \nbecause Earl Smith has been a role model to me my entire adult life. \nQuite frankly, I don't know that I would be privileged to serve in the \nSenate had it not been for his example, his support over 35 years.\n  I met Earl Smith when he founded the Cobb County Lions Club in the \n1960s and led it to be the best club in Georgia. I knew him as a \nbusinessman because I was in real estate and he was\n\n[[Page S12043]]\n\nin the heating and air conditioning business. He installed new units in \nhouses I sold, serviced them, and built a business to be one of the \nbest in the United States of America.\n  I know him because when our community was in need of facilities for \nour young people, Earl Smith took time from his business, raised money, \nand supported the construction of the East Cobb YMCA, today a shining \ngem in Georgia.\n  I know him because when our county was in a significant political \ndisaster with an absence of leadership and faced with unparalleled \ngrowth and unparalleled difficulty, Earl Smith volunteered and went and \nqualified for office, ran and was elected as chairman of the county \ncommission and took a county that had grown from 197,000 to 400,000, \nand now is almost a million; met the needs of its wastewater treatment; \nmet the needs of its electric power generation; met the needs of its \nroads and transportation system; and even brought about public \ntransportation to this growing and burgeoning community.\n  He did it during tough political times, but he did it because he was \na man of dedication to his community and a man who never ever quit.\n  Today, a man who has done all those things--built a great business, \nserved in the civic clubs, worked in his church, built a YMCA, a man in \nthe autumn of his life could do many things on beaches or in the \nmountains--decided there was one more mission. So he took the lead in \nraising $140 million to build the Cobb Energy Performing Arts Center in \nsuburban Atlanta in Cobb County near the Galleria Center, a facility \nupon which ground was just recently broken, and in less than 2 years \nwill be completed to be the finest urban performing arts center in the \nUnited States of America.\n  So today on the Senate floor, I rise for this brief moment to pay \ntribute to a man who has given countless hours, countless dollars, \ncountless efforts and all of his being to make his community better.\n  On November 7, when the community comes together to honor him, if I \ncan't be there in spirit, these words will be there so that he knows \nnot only does his community recognize him, but on this day on the floor \nof the Senate we pay tribute to Earl Smith of Cobb County, GA.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator will yield, I ask unanimous consent to be \nrecognized following the presentation by the Senator from South Dakota \nin morning business for such time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection? Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  The Senator from South Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/28/senate-section/article/S12043-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12043-S12045]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       COUNTRY-OF-ORIGIN LABELING\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an issue over \nwhich I am outraged, the continued delay of mandatory country-of-origin \nlabeling and the manner in which this issue has continually been \naddressed.\n  Mandatory country-of-origin labeling was authorized in the 2002 farm \nbill and signed into law by this President. This program is widely \nsupported not only by about 85 percent of our Nation's consumers but \nalso overwhelmingly by our Nation's producers.\n  This program is not only a consumer right-to-know issue, it is a \nvaluable marketing tool for ranchers and farmers.\n  During consideration of the fiscal year 2004 Agriculture \nappropriations measure, the Senate passed a sense of the Senate \nsupporting mandatory country-of-origin labeling, or COOL. The House \nversion of the spending measure included a 1-year delay for meat and \nmeat products.\n  During closed door consideration of the omnibus spending measure, the \nRepublican House leadership was successful in inserting a 2-year delay \nfor all commodities covered under the mandatory COOL Program with the \nexception of fish and shellfish.\n  This secretive, closed-door process was outrageous at that time. The \nomnibus package was settled behind closed doors, with no input from \nCOOL supporters.\n  Then, in the fiscal year 2006 Agriculture appropriations bill, the \nHouse version included, once again, a 1-year delay for meat and meat \nproducts covered under mandatory COOL.\n  The Senate, speaking in support of a mandatory program, included $3.1 \nmillion for an audit-based compliance program to cover implementation \ncosts. I repeat, a $3.1 million appropriations for implementation.\n  This small spending level, which was requested by the Bush \nadministration for program implementation, only served to show how \ngrossly the Department of Agriculture overestimated implementation \ncosts for COOL.\n  On Tuesday evening, House Republican Chairman Bonilla convened a \nconference committee on which I serve, meeting on the most recent \nagricultural spending measure.\n  For those of us who expected an open discussion on outstanding items, \nwe were sorely and entirely mistaken.\n  The chairman recessed that meeting subject to the call of the Chair \nwithout ever discussing COOL or indicating when we would reconvene.\n  Instead of an open discussion on this outstanding item, instead of \nany up-or-down public vote, the chairman simply modified, \nsinglehandedly, language on the final report to include a 2-year \ndelay--behind closed doors yet again, pushing back mandatory \nimplementation, this time until September 30, 2008.\n  Let me repeat: The Senate Agriculture appropriations bill contained \nno delay in country-of-origin labeling; in fact, it included funding \nfor implementation.\n  The House Agriculture appropriations bill called for a 1-year delay. \nThat happened behind closed doors without the benefit of debate, \nwithout the benefit of a vote. The chairman actually inserted language \ncalling for a 2-year delay, kicking this program over into the next \nfarm bill, essentially a do-over on the last 2002 farm bill in which we \ninitially made the law of the land country-of-origin labeling for meat \nand meat products.\n  This is truly outrageous. It is the purpose of a conference committee \nto discuss outstanding items in an open manner, not to change policy in \nback-room deals, in closed-door discussions in the dead of the night.\n\n  What happened on Wednesday was an incredibly corrupt process that \nfailed the American public and failed the political process of our \nNation. The chairman chose not to address COOL simply because he knew \nhe would lose. It was easier to address this item behind closed doors \nand avoid any vote because of the broad bipartisan support in the \nSenate that this program enjoys.\n  It is because of the 2-year delay and the appalling process by which \nthis open item was considered that I refused--I refused--to sign the \nconference report. It is because of this wrong doing that I will also \nvote against the conference report when it is considered by the full \nSenate.\n  Not only was the process by which this outstanding issue was \nconsidered absolutely corrupt, this delay yet again takes another stab \nat rewriting our farm bill. The farm bill, when signed into law, did \nnot indicate an implementation date of September 30, 2008, for \nmandatory COOL. It specifically stated September 30, 2004.\n  In order to change this implementation date and rewrite farm bill \npolicy, the majority leadership has had to hold two closed-door \nconferences to achieve its back-room goals.\n  The farm bill is a contract with rural America that needs to be \nhonored--not modified, changed, not destroyed in closed, back-door \ndealings during the night.\n  The most recent debacle with COOL is yet another illustration of how \nHouse congressional leadership is failing rural America.\n  The Bush administration advocates stripping in excess of $3 billion \nfrom this farm bill during the budget reconciliation process, weakening \nthe essential safety net that we need, that our Nation needs to foster \neconomic development in rural America, especially in time of weak \ncommodity prices.\n  The President advocated reducing commodity payments and leaving \nproducers in the cold. The President insisted last year that $3 billion \nbe cannibalized from the Conservation Security Program to fund a 2003-\n2004 either/or agriculture assistance disaster package.\n\n[[Page S12044]]\n\n  I find this is wrong, considering the pending Doha WTO negotiations \nand this administration's platform on gutting programs.\n  All of these reductions were supported by the President despite the \nfact that the farm bill has come in at $14 billion under the projected \ncosts. Agriculture has already paid enough.\n  The administration advocated closing over 700 Farm Service Agency \noffices nationwide, including 24 percent of the offices in my home \nState of South Dakota. I know that other States also were subject to \neven larger percentage cuts of offices. Not only would the \nadministration scrap or limit farm bill programs, the plan is it would \nmake it more difficult for the producer to obtain information about the \nfarm bill programs that are available, leaving producers too often to \nfend for themselves.\n  The administration has yet to issue disaster payments from over 1 \nyear ago. Producers in my home State of South Dakota are still waiting \nfor Livestock Assistance Program payments and the American Indian \nLivestock Feed Program payment. Even on the few payments that were \nissued, interest was not calculated properly, prompting a redo on parts \nof those payments.\n  Families have made financial decisions around this financial \nobligation. Congress did its part in passing the disaster package last \nyear. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's computer software glitch \nexcuse, quite frankly, wore thin many months ago.\n  These delayed payments are especially unacceptable considering that \nUSDA already had a process for getting money to producers. The USDA \nselected a crucial agriculture disaster package to use, frankly, as a \nguinea pig for a new untested computer software program.\n  The USDA and President Bush, even after opening our markets to \nCanadian beef, opening the market to a tidal wave of Canadian beef and \ncattle, would propose to open our borders to Japanese beef even before \nwe can secure that export market.\n  The Senate overwhelmingly passed an amendment to the agriculture \nspending measure but sent a strong message to this administration that \nthe Department of Agriculture should not allow Japanese beef into the \nUnited States until Japan allows beef into that nation.\n  A group of 21 Senators in a bipartisan fashion also introduced a bill \nthis week that would impose economic sanctions on Japanese beef unless \nJapan opens their borders to American beef.\n  American producers continue to lose $3.14 billion a year while the \nJapan market stays closed, and the administration has yet to open \nJapan's borders to American beef.\n  This is another example of a flawed trade agenda that fails to work \nfor the domestic U.S. agricultural producer.\n  I continue to hear from ranchers and farmers in South Dakota who are \ntired of seeing unrealized promises in these trade deals. We buy the \nJapanese cars, we buy the Japanese electronics, but Japan has yet to \ncomply with WTO, and Japan hast yet to comply with scientific standards \nin accepting the safest and highest quality beef in the world from the \nUnited States.\n  The Department of Agriculture is not making certain our farmers can \nstay in the fold. The administration is undermining our family farmers \nat too many turns. The most recent action on mandatory country-of-\norigin labeling and the closed-door consideration that prompted this \nmove is utterly unacceptable. The USDA worked with a majority of \nMembers of Congress to delay mandatory COOL behind closed doors. The \nUSDA's actions are just simply strong examples of how wrong the \nadministration has been on too many agricultural issues.\n  The Department of Agriculture, it seems to me, is responsive \nprimarily to the packing and processing industry, the large \nagribusiness conglomerates, instead of the family farmer and the family \nrancher.\n  I simply believe that our rural communities and agricultural \nproducers can do better. I believe that America can do better than this \nbackward, behind-closed-doors, in-the-dead-of-night process that has \ntaken over this year's Agriculture appropriations conference report.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I was a member of the conference that the \nSenator from South Dakota just described. I, too, refused to sign the \nconference report this week. I think when Senator Johnson uses the term \n``outrage,'' it is a very appropriate word to describe what happened in \nthat conference. That conference recessed at the call of the Chair. We \nnever reconvened. And behind closed doors with some secret deal, the \nmajority party decided to hear the siren call of the big packing houses \nand others, and they extended by 2 years the effective date of the time \nwhen the American people would finally figure out, by labels, where the \nmeat they were eating would come from.\n  The reason I think this meat labeling is important, we label \neverything. We label T-shirts, shoes, shirts. Name it, we label it. Go \nto the grocery store, see what is labeled. Everything on the shelf is \nlabeled. But then pick up a piece of meat and figure out if we know \nwhere it came from.\n  I held up a piece of steak on the Senate floor one day and said: I \ndefy anyone to tell me where this came from. Then I read a report from \nan inspector who went to a plant in Mexico, inspected the plant--this \nis a plant shipping meat to this country. He said there were carcasses \nhanging in unrefrigerated rooms, with feces smeared on the carcasses, \nall ready to be thrown in the hopper to be cut up and the meat sent to \nAmerican consumers. That is what he found, one inspection. By the way, \nthey closed that plant. Then it changed its name, changed its \nownership, reopened, and has never again been inspected.\n  That is why when one asks the question, How do you like your steak, \nthe answer ought to be, I like my steak from places where it is healthy \nmeat. We do not know where the healthy meat comes from unless we see a \nlabel to be able to determine where that meat comes from. That is why \nthe Senator from South Dakota and I and others have fought so \naggressively to get this meat-labeling law in place. It is now the law \nof the land. We have people making secret deals behind closed doors to \ntry to shut it down, to prevent it from ever being implemented. That is \nwhat happened this week. That is why I refused to sign the conference \nreport as well. I appreciate the effort of the Senator from South \nDakota. There are about half a dozen of us who would not sign the \nconference report because this was an arrogant approach to make a \nsecret deal behind closed doors that injures the consumers of this \ncountry. We should not put up with it.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. If I may ask a question of my colleague and my friend \nfrom North Dakota, does it not seem to the Senator that part of the \nreason we have lost essentially our entire export market for beef in \nAmerica is in part because even countries that want to buy American \nbeef, that understand we have the safest, highest quality beef in the \nworld, are not confident that we are, in fact, selling them American \nbeef? Their fear is that this may be Canadian, it may be Mexican, it \nmay be Argentine. Who knows where this beef comes from in the United \nStates because we are one of the few industrialized democracies in the \nworld that do not have country-of-origin labeling in place for meat. \nThat undermines the integrity of our sales abroad and further \ncomplicates our recapture of these lost export markets.\n  Does the Senator see that as one of the contributing factors to our \nloss of export market?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I do not think there is any question but that is the \ncase. We do not have labeling of this meat; other countries do. So we \nhave a homogenization of all kinds of meat that comes into this \ncountry, gets mixed here and there and everywhere.\n  The Senator from South Dakota said something very important. Our \nfarmers and ranchers in this country raise beef, meat. We raise a \nhealthy supply of meat. We inspect it. We have the healthiest supply of \nmeat anywhere in the world. I think the lack of having country-of-\norigin labeling on the meat that is sold in this country hurts all of \nus. It hurts our consumers as they consume. It also hurts us in our \nability to get into foreign markets, as my colleague has just \ndescribed.\n  Once again, the big interests get the attention around here behind \nclosed doors, outside of the view of the public. So we come out with \nlegislation now\n\n[[Page S12045]]\n\nthat says, well, not only is there a law that requires country-of-\norigin labeling, we will not allow that law to take effect. It has been \nin place for some while. We will extend for 2 years the excuse to allow \nthe Department of Agriculture not to put it in effect. It is, as the \nSenator has used the term, an outrage. It is the wrong way for this \nCongress to legislate.\n  I thank the Senator from South Dakota for yielding.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Isakson). The Senator yields back.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/28/senate-section/article/S12045-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12045-S12048]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today in The Washington Post, the question \nin the business section is: How Big Is $9.9 Billion?\n  That happens to be the single quarter profit for ExxonMobil Oil \nCompany. Pretty fortunate for this company to have a $9.9 billion \nquarterly profit. That profit comes from people who are driving up to \nthe gas pump, putting gasoline in their car; from people who are going \nto be heating their homes with home heating fuel, natural gas, and \npropane this winter.\n  So we have this spectacle of one industry with record profits, the \nhighest in the history of the world. This is the largest profit of any \ncorporation ever. The gain is here and the pain is elsewhere.\n  What does all of this mean? Well, I come from a State that is 10 \ntimes the size of Massachusetts in land mass. We have 642,000 people \nspread out in 10 Massachusettses. We are a Northern State, so it gets \ncold from time to time in the winter. We use home heating fuel and \nnatural gas to heat our homes. Heating our homes is not a luxury; it is \na necessity.\n  When we drive, we drive a fairly long ways. In fact, there is only \none other State in which the per capita use of gasoline is higher than \nthe State of North Dakota. It is Wyoming. We are fourth among all the \nStates in all energy consumption, second in gasoline per capita.\n  I am told in New York City that if someone decides to take a vacation \nto go see some distant relative in Bayonne, NJ, 50 miles away, they \nplan it for some months. They put an emergency kit in their trunk. They \nput blankets in their car. They probably get their car serviced. They \nget the gasoline all topped off. They get all ready to go 50 miles to \nNew Jersey to see their relatives. Why is it such a big deal? Because \nthey do not travel very much, that is why. In our part of the country, \nwe travel a lot. We drive a lot. It is not unusual to drive 100 or 200 \nmiles to get a part for a combine or a tractor and then drive another \n100 or 200 miles back. That is not a big deal.\n\n  In terms of pain, the pain in States such as North Dakota and, yes, \nWyoming and other States in our area of the country is very significant \nrelated to these prices. This is not a pain that is spread evenly.\n  We have the highest amounts in history in the corporate treasuries of \nthe oil companies, and then we have a huge pain for American consumers \nwho are paying at the gas pump and are going to pay for home heating \nfuel.\n  I would like to put up a couple of charts to show what is happening: \noil company profits. Let me make a point. I come from a State that \nproduces oil. I do not wish the oil industry bad news. I support a \nnumber of things the oil industry does. I have supported an $18 floor \non marginal wells, using tax credits to bring the oil up to $18 when \nnecessary. I support opening up Lease 181 in the Gulf of Mexico for \nadditional production. I support a number of things that the energy \nindustry and the oil industry want.\n  When I see what is happening with the oil industry at the moment, I \nknow that a year ago last January, the price of a barrel of oil was \n$34.50 a barrel. Now it is almost $30 above that. At $34.50 a barrel, \nthey were making the highest profits they had ever made. Now it is $30 \na barrel above that. What are the consequences of those increased \nprices? The consequences are enormous for American consumers. BP, one \nof the world's largest companies, 34 percent profit in the third \nquarter; ConocoPhillips, 89 percent profit increase in the quarter; \nExxonMobil, 75 percent profit increase in the quarter, $9.9 billion \njust for the one corporation.\n  The question might be asked, What is happening to this profit? Well, \nthis is BusinessWeek. This is hardly some silly liberal rag. \nBusinessWeek says, Why isn't big oil drilling more?\n  It says:\n\n       Rather than developing new fields, oil giants have \n     preferred to buy rivals--``drilling for oil on Wall Street.''\n\n  Do my colleagues want to know where a lot of these profits are going, \nthe record profits above last year? Buying back stock, hoarding cash, \nand drilling for oil on Wall Street. I have news for them. There is no \noil on Wall Street. They are going to drill a dry hole on Wall Street.\n  The point of the BusinessWeek article is to point out that much of \nthese profits are used to go buy others, to merge with others. We have \nnow seen these huge, blockbuster mergers. We now have bigger oil \ncompanies than we have ever seen.\n  There are three things that affect the price of oil. I know we have a \nlot of free market advocates in Congress. I think the free market is \nwonderful. I do not think it is perfect. A 7-foot, 2-inch basketball \nplayer gets paid the same amount as 1,000 elementary school teachers? \nThat is the marketplace, I guess. A short stop gets paid $250 million. \nJudge Judy, that woman on television--I do not watch her much. Once in \na great while, I tune in cruising the trials and she seems a little \ncrabby to me, but Judge Judy makes 10 times, 20 times, or 30 times the \namount of money that the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court makes. \nI guess that is the market system. I believe in the market system. The \nfree market system makes a lot of sense, but there is no free market in \noil at the moment.\n  There are three things happening with oil. One, there are the OPEC \nministers sitting around a table because they were fortunate to find \nthat on this little planet of ours, a substantial amount of the \nreserves of oil, the first, second and third largest reserves, exist \nunder the sands of the Middle East. OPEC ministers sit around a table \nand decide quantity and price to the extent they can--especially \nquantity--and then the major oil companies, made larger and more \nmuscular by blockbuster mergers, decide to use their raw muscle in the \nmarketplace. Third and finally, the futures market, which is designed \nto provide liquidity for trading, has become a grand bazaar for \nspeculation, an orgy of speculation. Those are the three elements that \nnow give us a price of oil of over $60 a barrel.\n  Sixty-six million U.S. homes are heated mainly with natural gas, and \ntheir heating bills this winter are going to be 48 percent on average; \n60 percent in my part of the country--60 percent increase to heat one's \nhome this winter at a time when the largest enterprises that sell the \noil are filling their bank accounts and drilling for oil on Wall \nStreet. Sound fair? It does not to me.\n  I have proposed a windfall profits tax, the proceeds of which would \nbe rebated back to the consumers. This is not your mother's or father's \nwindfall profits tax. We had one once before. It did not work very \nwell. That was to bring money into the Federal Government. I do not \npropose that.\n  Last year, the average cost of a barrel of oil was $40. In January, \nit was $34.50. The average cost the entire year was $40, and the energy \nindustry, the oil companies, had the highest profits in their history. \nI propose that above that level of $40 a barrel represents windfall or \nexcess profits.\n  I propose further that the oil companies have two choices: If they \ndecide to use all of that excess or windfall profit to invest back into \nthe ground to explore for more oil or to build refineries above ground, \nthen they would not pay a windfall profits tax. If they choose not to \ndo that, if they choose to drill for oil on Wall Street, if they choose \nto buy back their stock and hoard cash, then they would pay a 50-\npercent excise tax on those windfall profits, the entire proceeds of \nwhich would be sent back to the American consumers.\n  Some say, if that would happen, the oil companies would simply drill \nless or explore for oil much less aggressively. No. In fact, the most \nsignificant incentive to get them to explore for more energy would be \nto avoid paying a 50-percent excise tax called the windfall profits tax \nthat I have proposed. It\n\n[[Page S12046]]\n\nwould be the single most aggressive incentive to say, sink that money \nback into the ground, expand America's supply of energy.\n  It is interesting that we use one-fourth of the oil that is produced \nevery day. Eighty-four million barrels of oil a day are produced in the \nworld. We use 21 million barrels of oil a day in our country. This \nlittle spot on this globe called the United States of America uses one-\nfourth of all oil that is produced every day. Sixty percent of that \nwhich we produce comes in from other countries. We are hopelessly \naddicted to foreign oil, and it is dangerous for our country. That is a \nlonger term other significant issue we have to deal with. We cannot \ncontinue to be addicted to oil that comes from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, \nIraq, and elsewhere. We simply cannot do that. That is why we as a \ncountry need to establish goals toward energy independence.\n  John Kenneth Galbraith said: In the long run, we are all dead.\n  Those people who say, Well, in the long term, it is going to work \nout, in the long run, we are all dead. In the short term, we have a \nresponsibility moving into this winter to try to find a way to deal \nwith this dichotomy of the oil companies filling their treasuries and \nthe consumers trying to figure out, How do I pay the bill? How do I pay \na 60-percent increase in natural gas prices in the northern Great \nPlains? How do I pay $50 to put 16 or 18 gallons in my gas tank? I \nthink this Congress has a responsibility to address this.\n\n  As I said before, yes, I support the oil industry in a number of \nways. I have described them. I can describe others. I support the free \nmarket system. But I think this system is broken and I think what you \nhave is significant pain for the American consumers, significant gain \nfor the largest oil companies, and I think it is unfair.\n\n\n                                 TRADE\n\n  Today I want to speak about another subject very briefly and that is \nthe subject of trade. Some while ago there was an airplane flying over \nLos Angeles with a bent nose wheel. That nose wheel, twisted and bent, \nmeant that airplane stayed up a good number of hours to dump fuel \nbecause they were going to make a landing and they worried about \nwhether that landing would result in the safety of the airplane for the \npassengers and crew. There was a lot of drama on television as all of \nus watched that airplane circle.\n  Fortunately that airplane landed. There was a plume of smoke and ball \nof fire and it came to a safe stop. Those pilots must have been \nskillful pilots.\n  It reminded me of something I read a couple of weeks before that, and \nthat is that particular airline and virtually all other airlines \ndecided to outsource their maintenance. I have no idea whether that \nplayed a role in the drama I watched on television that day, but that \nparticular airline does some of its maintenance in El Salvador and \nflies its airplanes down to El Salvador empty to do its maintenance. I \nwonder why they do airplane maintenance in El Salvador and fly an empty \nAirbus 320 down to El Salvador to have it done. The answer is, you can \npay a worker in El Salvador a fraction of what you pay a worker in this \ncountry and save a lot of money.\n  I found out since that about 40 percent of the maintenance of our \nairplanes with commercial airlines is now outsourced; some outsourced \nto other companies in our country, some outsourced to other countries, \nas a matter of fact.\n  I mentioned the airplane that was flying over Los Angeles with a bent \nnose wheel had some of its maintenance done in the country of El \nSalvador in order to save money. Outsourcing is something we hear about \nevery day. Outsourcing is a term that doesn't sound so ominous unless \nit affects you. Outsourcing means you might get fired because somebody \nelse is willing to work for a substantially lower salary. Corporations \nhave now discovered we live in a world with roughly 6.5 billion people \nand there are anywhere from 1 to 2 billion people now who are willing \nto work for virtually pennies, so they have decided what we ought to do \nis outsource that work. When we produce something, let's outsource it, \nproduce it somewhere else for 30 cents or 40 cents an hour, save a lot \nof money, and come back to this country and sell it on the store \nshelves in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia and Los Angeles and Chicago and \nDenver. Particularly in the last decade or so, that has become \nsomething most corporations are doing and they say we can't compete \nunless we outsource.\n  What we are seeing is a massive exodus of American jobs. I have gone \nthrough a few in other speeches. I will start by pointing out we have \nthe highest trade deficit in American history. No other country has \never come close. What does this mean? Today is Friday. It means today \nwe are going to buy $2 billion more in goods from other countries than \nwe are going to sell. That means today, on Friday, we are going to rack \nup a $2 billion debt, just for today, and every day, 7 days a week, all \nyear long, a $2 billion debt because we are buying from abroad much \nmore than we are selling. That means we are selling part of our \ncountry; that is what it means. This doesn't work out. This mortgages \nthe future for our kids.\n  How does that happen? A significant part of the debt is with China. \nAbout a third of it is with the country of China. Substantial numbers \nof jobs outsourced from this country are going to the country of China.\n  IBM, Big Blue--this is a couple of months ago--proceeds to lay off \n13,000 workers in Europe and the United States; IBM plans to increase \nits payroll in India by 14,000 workers. By the way, the memorandum from \nIBM says, When you tell your workers they are losing their jobs, don't \never use the word ``outsourcing'' and make sure you tell them this is \nnot about the quality of your work as you tell them you are done.\n  This young lady worked for Palm Pilot, a young African-American woman \nwho went to school, did everything you should do, got a great job in a \ntechnology company called Palm Pilot. The problem was they outsourced \nher job and many others. People think this is just about factories \nmaking textiles; it is not. It is outsourcing of good jobs--engineers' \nand technicians' jobs and professional jobs. The last note she made on \nher Palm Pilot was, ``My job's gone to India,'' but she was fired. By \nthe way, she had to train the person in India who took her job.\n  I have gone through a long list of these. You have all seen the Fruit \nof the Loom Guys. They advertise Fruit of the Loom by having people \ndress up as grapes. I have never understood why they do that, but \napparently it works. So you dress somebody up as a green grape or red \ngrape and people dance and sing and people apparently think that is the \npair of shorts or the undershirt they ought to buy because they saw a \ndancing grape. At any rate, Fruit of the Loom used to be all American. \nYou walked around and put on some Fruit of the Loom underwear and you \nfelt you were all American. No more. There are not any Fruit of the \nLoom garments made in the United States. They are gone.\n  When I think of Levis, there is not one pair of Levis made in the \nUnited States. By the way, if you wear Tony Lama boots, you might be \nwearing boots from China.\n  The list goes on and on. I have described many of them. I have \ndescribed the problems in trade through automobiles, which is obviously \na big ticket item. We have a lot of good jobs in the automobile \nindustry. It is interesting, 30 years ago the largest corporation in \nAmerica was General Motors. Most people who went to work for General \nMotors expected to have a career for a lifetime. They worked for a \nlifetime and then retired. General Motors paid good salaries, they paid \ngood benefits, they had health care, they paid retirement benefits, and \nit was America's largest corporation. Now the largest corporation is \nWal-Mart--I guess it switches between GE and Wal-Mart, but I believe it \nis Wal-Mart at the moment. When people go to work for Wal-Mart, they \ndon't go to work for a lifetime. There is a 70-percent turnover in Wal-\nMart and the average wage is between $17,000 and $19,000 a year, and \nhalf of them don't have benefits. Difference? Pretty big difference. \nWhat does that say about the job base in our country? I think that says \na lot about the job base in this country.\n\n  What we need to do, it seems to me, is to care a little about the \ncircumstances of international trade and begin to decide, as a country, \nare we going to put up with this? Is this what we want to have happen?\n\n[[Page S12047]]\n\n  The description of these next photos I want to show you describes \nsomething that tells about the conditions in which we are producing \nproducts we are purchasing. When I say we, the corporations that are \noutsourcing these products. These happen to be photographs that were \ntaken in Bangladesh. These photographs are of striking workers at a \nfactory called Pantex, which produced sports clothing for the Decathlon \nlabel, which is sold in the U.S. and Europe.\n  These people, mostly children, were forced to work 14 hours a day. \nThey worked them 7 days a week, and 700 Pantex workers decided the \nconditions under which we are working are almost intolerable, 14-hour \ndays, 7 days a week, being paid pennies, so they protested. They \nblocked the gate to the plant.\n  Here is what happened to them by the Government and the company \nitself--people were beaten, badly beaten. People were killed. Why? \nBecause they had decided they wanted the opportunity--you can see the \nphotographs and they are devastating photographs--they wanted the \nopportunity as workers to be able to work in a safe work plant, to be \npaid decent wages, not to have to work 14 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n  Does anybody in this country care that those are the conditions under \nwhich products are made and sold on the store shelves of America? Does \nanybody care that we tell Americans you have to compete with that, you \nhave to compete with companies that will hire kids, work them 14 hours \na day, 7 days a week? And if somebody does care about it, when will we \ndo something about it? When will we pass legislation to do something \nabout it?\n  This gospel of so-called offshoring these days is now taken as \nsomething that needs to be done in order to stay competitive. Get rid \nof your American workers, sleep well at night, don't say the Pledge of \nAllegiance in the boardroom, decide you should hire kids, hire whatever \nyou want, hire a contractor who hires kids or hire a contractor who \nhires young women. I held a hearing one day and two women showed up \nfrom a plant in Honduras. This particular plant was making shirts for \nPuff Daddy.\n  Puff Daddy, you might remember, changed his name to P. Diddy. I don't \nknow why somebody would change his name from Puff Daddy to P. Diddy, \nbut then he decided he would change his name to Diddy, so it is Puff \nDaddy to P. Diddy to Diddy. His real name is Sean Combs and Sean Combs \nis quite a sporty guy. He dresses well. I have seen some pictures. He \nhas a line of clothing which apparently is a pretty good line of \nclothing.\n  Two women who worked in a plant in Honduras, to make P. Diddy or \nDiddy or Puff Daddy or whatever it is shirts, showed up to talk about \nthe conditions in that plant. This is a plant that was doing contract \nwork.\n  Mr. Diddy--I am not quite sure what I should call him, Mr. Combs or \nwhatever his name is--said he wasn't aware of this. And I expect that \nis the case. I don't think he or anyone else who engages in this \nbelieves that a contractor is going to have a plant in Honduras or \nBangladesh or Sri Lanka or Indonesia and say it is fine if they go \nahead and hire a bunch of kids or hire people and don't have safe \nworkplaces, don't pay them adequate wages. Most people would say no, \nthat is not fine. But it is fine if it is out of sight and they don't \nhave to know about it. Just get the socks made, shirt made, shoes made, \nget them over here. We don't care about the conditions in which they \nare made.\n\n  By the way, we get a chance, as an American company, to say if our \npeople can't compete with that, by God, they lose their jobs because we \nare going to be competitive, and if it takes hiring people in China or \nBangladesh to be competitive, that is the way it works.\n  I don't understand this at all. When Franklin Delano Roosevelt died, \nthere was a man who waited hours in line to go past his casket, along \nwith other Americans. A reporter was asking people for his story, to \nget a little flavor of things, he was asking people their thoughts and \nso on. He walked up to this fellow, obviously a workman, holding his \nhat in his hand. He stood there for hours and had tears in his eyes. \nThe reporter said,\n\n       Did you know Franklin Roosevelt?\n\n  And this fellow said,\n\n       Oh, no, I didn't. But he knew me.\n\n  What he meant was this President knew the American worker and stood \nup for the working men and women of this country. ``He knew me.''\n  Who knows America's workers now? Who knows the workers who will be \ntold today or tomorrow that their job has gone to China, their job has \ngone elsewhere? Where will we develop the base, the foundation for the \nmiddle class that sustains the economy in this country?\n  I didn't bring it to the floor today, but I should have--I asked the \nLabor Department for a list of the companies that have outsourced jobs \nand are then claiming, as a result of that, through filing at the \nDepartment of Labor, trade adjustment assistance for the people who are \nlosing their jobs because of outsourcing. I was very surprised to find \nthat in the first 6 months of this year I received 32 pages, single \nspaced, small type, both sides, line after line after line of the names \nof companies that have outsourced their jobs in the first 6 months of \nthis year.\n  My point is this. None of this adds up.\n  We are a country that is unique in the world. We built something \nextraordinary, and we did it because we honored work, we valued work. \nWe understood that men and women in this country who go to work and \nprovide for themselves earn an honest wage for a day's work. We decided \nthe conditions of that work shall be that workers have a right to \norganize. And, oh, by the way, you know that little teddy bear you are \nbuying at some shop today may well have been built in China or some \nother country, and some worker who was protesting 12, 14-hour days, 7 \ndays a week was probably sent to prison.\n  I should come to the floor and read the names of people who are \nsitting in prison today in China. Their transgression? They believed \npeople should have a right to organize. We decided long ago that people \nshould have the right to organize and work in a safe workplace. We have \nchild labor laws. We have laws that prevent companies from putting \nchemicals and pollution into the ground, the streams, and the air. But \nyou can get rid of all of that. Just pole-vault over all of those \nthings and move your jobs offshore in order to be ``competitive.''\n  What is the strategy and how does all that work? Who is going to pay \nthe bills? Who is going to go to work in this country in the future and \nearn sufficient money to take care of their family if we do not stand \nup for the interests of this country? I am not suggesting we should put \nwalls around our country. I am just saying our trade strategy is a \nbankrupt failure, a total failure, and no one really seems to want to \nadmit it.\n  Our trade strategy ought to be to push other countries up, not push \nour country down. I come from a State that needs to sell a lot of \nproducts overseas. We produce a lot of agricultural commodities, and we \nneed to ship a fair amount overseas. So I believe in fair trade. Free \ntrade does not mean anything to me. ``Free trade'' is just a jingoistic \nphrase, people standing on street corners banging cymbals, wearing \nrobes, and chanting ``free trade.''\n  What I care about is for this country to require fair trade. We are \nnot, and for this reason: For the first 25 years after the Second World \nWar, we could beat anyone, anywhere, anytime with a hand tied behind \nour back. We were the biggest and strongest country in the world, and \nmost of our trade policy could be concessional foreign policy, in many \ncases softheaded, but still concessional and still foreign policy.\n  In the second 25 years after the Second World War, our trading \npartners became bigger, tougher, shrewder, and the competition became \nmuch different. But what also happened was the growth of enterprises, \nwhich can produce almost anywhere in the world, decided that if you can \nproduce by finding much cheaper labor elsewhere, that is what we are \ngoing to do. We create those enterprises here. We give them a charter \ncalled a corporation.\n  By the way, many of them not only are producing elsewhere where they \ncan hire kids for 30 cents an hour, but they are also running their \noperations through a mailbox in the Bahamas in\n\n[[Page S12048]]\n\norder to avoid paying taxes in this country, which is a subject for \nanother day.\n  The question is, When will, or will ever, this Congress decide that \nthis strategy does not work, that this strategy is not a strategy that \nis going to strengthen this country, it is going to weaken this \ncountry? Go to any business school in this country and ask those who \nare teaching classes about outsourcing, and they will give you a dim \nprospect for future jobs because you can hire engineers in India for a \nwhole lot less than you can in the United States. You can hire people \nin China for a whole lot less money than you can in the United States. \nThat does not mean a textile worker in this country is valueless. Jobs \nin this country are important.\n  I once asked Carla Hills, who was a trade ambassador, Is there \nanything that you wouldn't trade away? Are there any concentric circles \nof economic activity that are essential for our country to remain a \nstrong world economic power? The answer was really not. Whatever the \ncompetition is, it is.\n  That is just wrong. That just does not make any sense. There are \ncertain things that are required in our country for our country to \nremain a world economic power. Part of it is to stand up for our own \neconomic interests, and, yes, to care a little about trying to bring \nothers up but certainly not to allow our standard of living to be \npushed down.\n  Those who hear me who feel differently think, as they have always \nthought, those of us who speak this way are xenophobic isolationist \nstooges who don't have enough brain power to see over the horizon. \nWon't they ever learn expanded trade benefits everybody?\n  Expanded trade, if it means outsourcing of American jobs because you \ncan find people who will work for pennies an hour, does not benefit \nthis country. It benefits the consumers in the short term perhaps, but \nconsumers without jobs will not long be consumers. And this economic \nstrategy, I think, finally--given this chart that I showed at the \nstart--finally the understanding by nearly anyone who is thinking and \nsober is this strategy is creating an abyss for this country that is \nvery serious. This is a very serious problem: mountains of red ink, \nsubstantial lost jobs, and economic opportunity leaving our country.\n\n  I have a series of recommendations on how to respond to all of this. \nI will mention one again because we are going to vote on it the week \nafter next--I have offered it four times, and I have lost all four \ntimes. We will have a fifth vote. One would think that the first baby \nstep in the direction of doing the right thing would be to shut down \nthe perverse and idiotic tax exemption or tax credit for moving jobs \noverseas. Yes, that is right. We actually provide a reward for someone \nwho shuts down their American manufacturing plant and moves the jobs \noverseas for the purpose of shipping the product back into this \ncountry. We actually reward them for doing that.\n  One would think the first baby step would be to shut down that \nperverse tax incentive. There are not enough votes in this Chamber, at \nleast historically, to do that. We are going to see the week after next \nwhether some in this Chamber who have previously voted against it might \neither have seen the light, felt the heat, one way or the other, and \nhave decided it is not useful--in fact, it is destructive--to reward \nthose who decide to ship their American jobs overseas.\n  That is just the first step. There are many others, and I will in a \nfuture discussion talk about the practical steps we should and could \ntake to protect the economic interests of our country, even as we \nattempt in every way to expand fair trade.\n  I am not against trade. I believe trade is important. But this \ncountry ought to expand opportunities for fair trade all around the \nworld and stop being a pin cushion, an Uncle Sam that is played for \nUncle Sucker in every single way.\n  I did not talk about automobiles, but the automobile trade is \nunbelievable. Has trade in automobiles required U.S. companies to \nimprove their vehicles? Yes, it sure has. But I will give, again, one \nexample with respect to Korea, and there is a longer story with China, \nbut Korea is enough.\n  We have ships that bring Korean cars into this country. I am sure \nthey are offloading today at some port. Nearly 700,000 Korean cars are \nshipped into our country each year. Do you know how many American cars \nwe are able to sell in Korea? Less than 4,000--700,000 cars coming this \nway, and we get less than 4,000 cars into the Korean marketplace.\n  One that is of interest to me is the Dodge Dakota pickup because it \nis named after my State, Dakota. There was a time when the folks who \nmade Dodge Dakota got really excited because they sold something like \n100 of them in Korea. They thought they were going to ramp up a sales \neffort. They seemed to like Dodge Dakotas. They got shut down just like \nthat.\n  Look at the sales of Dodge Dakota pickups in Korea for the first 9 \nmonths of this year and you will see the Korean Government did a great \njob of shutting that down. They want to ship 700,000 cars and allow us \nto ship 4,000 back. What does that mean? It means a mass exodus of \nAmerican jobs.\n  Mr. President, we have so many challenges. My hope is that we will, \nthrough amendments I will offer to the reconciliation bill and other \napproaches in the Senate and in other ways, finally come to grips with \nwhether we think this is doing anything other than dramatically \ninjuring America's future economic opportunities.\n  One of my favorite people is Warren Buffett. He is the world's second \nrichest person, but you wouldn't know it looking at him, and you \nwouldn't know it talking with him. He is a wonderful guy with a great \nsense of humor, just plain spoken.\n  Warren Buffett is one of the few main business people in this \ncountry, one of the few people coming from a business background who \nsays this is nuts, this is dangerous. This is going to turn us into a \ncountry of sharecroppers. He is very up front about it. Very few others \nare.\n  My hope is that ideas he has advanced--one of them I particularly \nlike and they advanced in an article in Fortune magazine, which is how \nto deal with these devastating deficits and outsourcing, is that at one \npoint or another this begins to take root in this Chamber.\n  Today I understand we are poised on the head of a pin because a \nSupreme Court nomination was withdrawn yesterday, and that is a big \nnews item. Today the special prosecutor, at 2 o'clock, will announce \nthe results of his decision with respect to the leak of outing a covert \nCIA officer. We have all these issues, and we dance on the head of pins \non all these issues. Yes, some of them are important, some not. This is \nimportant. This describes whether our kids are going to have jobs; \nwhether our country is going to expand and grow; whether America is \ngoing to be, in the future, what it has been in the past: a strong \ncountry, a world economic power, and one that can supply and one that \ncan provide a standard of living and the kind of life that Americans \nhave built for themselves for many decades.\n  Mr. President, I will speak more about this issue at some future \npoint. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I wish to thank each of them \nfor their long, consistent, and arduous effort to bring this bill up \nfor what I anticipate will be a successful resolution to the bill, with \nfinal passage in this Senate in coming weeks. Senator Levin and I have \nbeen on this committee for some 27 years together. We are ready.\n  Given that the unanimous consent was accepted by the Senate, both \ncommittee staffs are actually at this time working on amendments and \nother\n\n[[Page S12049]]\n\nmatters in preparation for the future consideration of this bill by the \nSenate. I urge Senators who might wish to have amendments discussed, \nfirst, to listen to the terms of the unanimous consent agreement and \nstudy those. Flexibility is given to the managers to reach a joint \nagreement for Members that have amendments not covered explicitly in \nthe numerical amounts in the unanimous consent.\n  The committee staffs are working. I urge Senators to bring to Senator \nLevin and myself such matters as they may be interested in, and we will \ndo our very best to accommodate Senators.\n  This Nation is at war. Each day we find in our hearts compassion for \nthose we have lost, those on the battlefields today--not just in Iraq \nand Afghanistan but all throughout the world--and their families at \nhome.\n  I thank our leaders for passing that unanimous consent, and I \nencourage Senators to submit their amendments and bring them to our \nattention.\n  The committee met this week. We reported out the intelligence \nauthorization bill. That, hopefully, will be a joint referral to the \nCommittee on Government Operations. There is provision in that bill \nwhich was clearly within the jurisdiction of that committee. I am very \nfortunate to have on the Committee on Armed Services both the chairman, \nChairman Collins, and the ranking member, Senator Lieberman, as well \nas, of course, Senator Roberts. During the course of our deliberations \nyesterday, we quickly recognized it would be appropriate to be referred \nto that committee the intelligence bill with regard to that provision. \nThat is progress we have made this week.\n  I am also pleased the committee pointed out a number of nominees for \nimportant civilian posts and, indeed, military posts in our Department \nof Defense. I understand some have been worked on today, and I will \ncheck to see whether other nominations can be cleared.\n  I am proud to say the Committee on Armed Services was very active \nthis week. We have a charter now. We are back in business. I am very \npleased that the prospects are we will pass our legislation.\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, in a few moments we will be closing for the \nweek. But before doing so, I wanted to bring to the attention of my \ncolleagues something that was just brought to my attention about 2 \nhours ago when I was e-mailed by our President pro tempore, Senator Ted \nStevens.\n  Basically, in a little cryptic language, it said: Bill, did you read \nthe New York Times today?\n  I said: No, I haven't read the New York Times today.\n  Then he gave me one statistic that he picked up. I looked at it, and \nhe is exactly right. That statistic drove home to me a threat--we don't \ntalk very much about it--that we need to face up to and to act on. We \nare doing some powerful things in the Senate to do just that. But we \nare going to have to put it out front, and we are going to have to lead \non it.\n  The statistic is that China, in engineering, one field, is producing \n442,000 new undergraduates a year, along with 48,000 graduates with \nmaster's degrees and 8,000 Ph.D.s in engineering. I focus on that to \nseize the opportunity that we do have before us a real threat that \nAmerica is losing--not will lose but is losing--today the edge in \ntechnology that we depend on, and we depend on it in terms of creating \nthe American dream, maintaining that American dream to pass on to our \nchildren, and it is time for us to act.\n\n  This has not been the first time that certain challenges have been \nput before us. We faced a similar challenge, and we overcame it. On \nOctober 4, 1957, the Soviet Union--and we all remember that day, or \nthose of us who were alive at the time remember that date--successfully \nlaunched the first manmade satellite into space. I was a very little \nboy at the time sitting around the dinner table and watching the \nstunning effect that had on my own family as they talked about it, I \nremember, one Sunday afternoon.\n  The event stunned America, but it spurred us to action. We don't have \na Sputnik, per se, moment, but we need to create it. We need to educate \nthe American people where we are today, the challenge that we face and \nthe threat that we face to our competitive edge.\n  Less than a year later after that October 4 day in 1957, President \nEisenhower signed the National Defense Education Act to restore \nAmerica's preeminence in science. Math, engineering, and science became \nour top educational priorities. As a result, not only did we close the \ngap with the Soviet Union, but we far exceeded our own dreams, our own \nexpectations at the time.\n  Fifty years later we face a similar challenge with the entry of \nChina, the example I used, but also India and soon to be many other \nnations, into this global marketplace. As writer and observer Tom \nFriedman details in his wonderful book, ``The World Is Flat,'' American \nworkers face accelerating competition not only in the low-wage \nmanufacturing sector but now in the new fields of science and \nengineering and the technological fields. That is where the competition \nis today--with China and with India.\n  According to BusinessWeek, together China and India graduate 500,000 \nscientists and engineers a year--every year, 500,000. How about \nAmerica? Where are we? Just guess. Think. Are we more? Less?\n  United States, 60,000; 500,000, India and China every year. We are \ndown to 60,000. China, I just mentioned--more than 442,000 graduates \nevery year.\n  While the entire world is getting smarter and faster and stronger in \nmath and science, the United States is not. We are moving in the \nopposite direction. Indeed, the number of engineering degrees awarded \nin the United States is down 20 percent from just a decade ago, 10 \nyears ago. We are moving in the opposite direction. If current trends \ncontinue, by 2010 more than 90 percent of all scientists in the world, \nof all engineers in the world, 90 percent will be in Asia. Already, the \nmajority of graduate science and engineering students in the United \nStates are foreign born.\n  Let me say that again. Already, the majority of graduate students in \nscience and engineering in the United States are foreign born.\n  Instead of investing their new skills in America, they are \nincreasingly returning--not staying here but returning to their homes. \nAccording to Education for Innovation Initiative, which is a coalition \nof America's most prominent business organizations, we need to double--\nwe need to double the number of American science, technology, \nengineering, and mathematic students by 2015 if we are to remain the \ntechnological leader in the 21st century. That is a lot to do by 2015, \njust 10 years from now--a doubling. As I said, we are moving in the \nopposite direction.\n  If we don't significantly improve math and science education in this \ncountry, there is a real danger that we will fall permanently behind--\nonce we lose that competitive edge in technology, in science, in \nmathematics where most job creation, as we look to the future, occurs.\n  How are we failing? I used the example of students today at the \ngraduate level in engineering. So where does it all start? You have to \njump all the way back down to the 15-, 16-year-old in the middle school \nareas. Are we failing there as we look to the future? They will become \nthe graduates, whether it is math, science, engineering, or some other \nfield, in the future.\n  Well, right now in the 29 industrialized nations in the world, if I \nasked you just to imagine where you think we are if you look at 15-\nyear-old students--and most people would say,\n\n[[Page S12050]]\n\nwhether you are going to be a scientist or an engineer, it is really \ndetermined in that age, from about 14 to 16. If I happened to ask the \nAmerican people listening but also my colleagues, if there are 29 \nindustrialized countries, and we want to rank mathematics performance \nof students around the world, is the United States first? You would \nthink so. Maybe fifth? Surely, you would think so, in the United States \nof America, with our resources and our great innovation and culture of \ncreativity and the American dream.\n  It is not 5th. It is not 10th. It is not 15th. It is not 20th. The \nUnited States now ranks 24th of 29 industrialized nations in math \nliteracy among 15-year-olds. We fall behind who? You can name 23 of \nthem, but it is Finland, Korea, Canada, the Czech Republic, Ireland, \nPoland, Hungary, Spain, France.\n\n  Business leaders who observe this tell us that fewer and fewer \nAmerican workers have the math and science skills they need for today's \njobs. One researcher at the Hudson Institute warns:\n\n       We're rolling into the most severe shortage of skilled \n     workers this country has ever seen.\n\n  And in what must be the most dismal development, tutoring American \nstudents in math via the Internet is becoming a boom industry--in \nIndia. We are actually outsourcing our education.\n  All this really says: What do you do? These are the observations. \nThey are observations at the middle school level, the high school \nlevel, the graduate level, even beyond graduate level, and we are \nfailing. So it is incumbent upon us to act, and to act with meaningful \nsolutions that respond to a real problem that is there today, and it is \ngoing to increase over time. We cannot afford to lose the technological \nrace. It is a matter of economics. It is a matter of security. I \nbelieve it is a matter of national security as well. It is a matter of \nkeeping jobs, good-paying jobs right here in America.\n  People say: Well, Senator Frist, he is a doctor. He is a scientist. \nHe has a little bias.\n  It is way beyond that. Math and the hard sciences are what drive \ninnovation in just about every single industry today. From computers, \nto my own field of medicine, we depend on technology to improve our \nquality of life, to be able to figure out how we solve problems that \nseemingly are insurmountable, that are unsolvable. We solve them by the \nmost innovative, most creative, the most advanced technological \nsolution. That is where that competitive edge exists.\n  Not only that but math comprehension is critical to everyday tasks \ntoday, whether it is balancing the checkbook or figuring out how to \ninterpret your 401(k). You need those everyday skills. We are thriving \nin a fast-changing modern world, constantly evolving world, moving so \nmuch faster than any of us would have anticipated 5 or 10 years ago. We \nneed these skills to survive and to thrive.\n  That is why in terms of action, in the sort of things we need to do, \nin August I proposed the national SMART grant. The national SMART grant \nprovides low-income students up to $1,500 in their third and in their \nfourth year of college to pursue math and science. Together the maximum \nPell grant and the national SMART grant cover nearly an entire typical \nState university tuition bill for those last 2 years.\n  People say: Why the last 2 years? The last 2 years because that is \nwhen people determine their majors, in those years of college. The \nnational SMART grant will make it easier for low-income students to \nmeet that heavy class load in math and in science. We know that those \nacademic loads are heavy in those particular fields.\n  Some of my colleagues have worked on this. I thank them. To start \nnaming them, Senators Enzi and Roberts and Warner have done a \ntremendous job in getting this legislation to the point that it exists, \nand each has been a champion of rigorous math and science education. In \naddition, I thank Chairman Enzi, especially, for more than doubling the \ninvestment in this SMART grant program. It is focused on the needs I am \nspeaking about today. As a matter of fact, the SMART grant is a good, \nsolid first step in getting America's science and math education back \non track so that we truly can globally compete.\n  Mr. President, throughout our history, our Nation has been blessed to \nbe a land of innovation and creativity and dynamism. We have attracted \nthe best, and we have attracted the brightest from across the oceans. \nAnd they have come and made our country an even more vibrant and more \ndynamic place. I am confident that if we keep our focus on the \nfundamentals, America will continue to offer unrivaled opportunity and \nprosperity for generations to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/28/senate-section/article/S12050-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12050-S12051]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            JAPAN BEEF TRADE\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President I have joined with my colleague from North \nDakota, Senator Conrad, and 19 other Senators to introduce a bill to \nrestore normal beef trade with Japan.\n  Prior to the discovery of BSE or mad cow disease in the United States \nin December 2003, Japan was the largest export market for American beef \nin the world. But since that fateful day 2 years ago, U.S. beef \nproducers have been locked out of the Japanese market.\n  To say the loss of this market has been detrimental to the viability \nof the American beef industry is an understatement. This is an issue \nthat effects every part of the U.S. beef industry from the cowboys in \nwestern Kansas to the folks standing in line at the grocery store \nshopping for hamburger patties in New York City.\n  And perhaps this is felt no where as strongly than in places like \nDodge City, KS Dodge City is a town that has built it's economy on the \nbeef industry since the days of the wild west. It is a place where the \nnumber of cattle far outnumbers the number of people that live within \nthe county lines. And it is the place that I call home.\n  The beef industry is a major economic driver for Dodge, but it's one \nof the largest industries in Kansas--representing over $5 billion in \nannual revenue.\n  We are a state with 6.65 million head of cattle, compared to a human \npopulation of 2.6 million. In 2003, cattle represented 62 percent of \nthe Kansas cultural cash receipts and the processing industry alone \nemploys over 18,700 Kansans. And to boot, we rank in the top three of \nvirtually every major beef statistic.\n  But, trade with Japan has an impact that extends well beyond the \nborders of Kansas--it's an issue that affects all of farm country. The \ncattle industry comprises one of the largest sectors in American \nagriculture--with business in every state. Japan is the largest export \nmarket for food and agricultural products from the United States and \nbeef is one of the largest and most lucrative exports to Japan.\n  In short, for ranchers across farm country, including those in \nKansas, there are few issues more important than the viability of the \nbeef industry--and specifically how we handle BSE.\n  This week marks the year anniversary of the mutual agreement the U.S. \nand Japan signed to resume normal beef trade. Since then, the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture, USDA, has worked hard to implement \nsubstantive improvements in our ability to prevent, identify and \nrespond to BSE. For instance, as a part of their enhanced animal \nsurveillance effort, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, \nAPHIS, has tested over 450,000 head of cattle for BSE.\n  Despite this increased testing, Japan refuses to reopen its market \nand has instead relied upon imports of beef from countries with little \nor no testing for BSE.\n  The increased U.S. testing, in coordination with the U.S. Food and \nDrug Administration implementation of safeguards that ensure the safety \nof our food supply, have bolstered our claim to having the safest and \nmost abundant food supply in the world.\n  Regrettably, the Japanese has failed to match these standards with \nprudent efforts to change their policy of keeping American beef out of \nJapan.\n  The Japanese Food Safety Commission, the body with the delegated \nresponsibility to review the process by which Japan would reopen its \nmarket, and others within the government have been unresponsive to \nextensive diplomatic efforts made by U.S. officials during the last \nyear.\n  The office of the U.S. Trade Representative and USDA have worked in \nconcert with President Bush, other\n\n[[Page S12051]]\n\ncabinet agencies and officials and U.S. Congress to restore regular \nbeef trade.\n  Despite the efforts of even the highest office in our nation's \ngovernment, Japan continues to keep American beef out of their country.\n  The Japanese Food Safety Commission and others within the government \nhave repeatedly demanded excessive documentation and paperwork with \nlittle or no justification. None of these requests reflect the \ninternationally accepted phytosanitary guidelines. Rather, they appear \nto be a dilatory tool to prevent any effort to resume the purchase of \nAmerican beef.\n  There have been claims that American beef is unsafe. This is simply \nnot true. The international science says our cattle under 30 months of \nage are safe and not at risk. Yet, we have agreed to not send meat from \nany animals under 20 months of age to Japan.\n  Furthermore, after 20 confirmed cases of BSE in Japan, the claim that \nU.S. beef is not as safe as Japanese beef is simply an insult to \nAmerican producers. Still the market remains closed to the U.S.\n  In recent weeks, Japan has insisted upon an unwarranted and \nunjustified trade barrier by preventing the resumption of regular beef \ntrade with the U.S. Japan has a complicated bureaucracy in place to \ndeal with the issue of BSE. In 2003, the Japanese Parliament \nestablished the Food Safety Commission as a Cabinet Office tasked with \nensuring food safety.\n  This week, the Japanese Food Safety Commission again failed to reach \nan agreement to remove the blockade to U.S. beef imports. And to insult \nto injury, four of the Commission's 12 members did not even show up to \nthe meeting because of their alleged concern with the safety of U.S. \nbeef.\n  I am troubled that our negotiations with Japan have deteriorated to \nthis point. Japan has traditionally been a distinguished and important \ntrading partner for the U.S. Furthermore, they have been a critical \nally in the War on terrorism.\n  Despite, this long-standing relationship, I am here today to support \nlegislation that requires the U.S. Department of Treasury to implement \nadditional tariffs on goods grown, produced or manufactured in Japan \nunless the U.S. Trade Representative certifies that Japan has reopened \nits market to American beef by December 15, 2005.\n  I have long supported free trade. Our country has benefitted from \ntrade agreements with Chile, Australia, Canada and Mexico, and now \nCentral America. These trading relationships are a necessity to ensure \nthe ability of American farmers, ranchers and businessmen alike to \ncompete in the global marketplace.\n  But, these agreements hinge heavily upon the commitment of the \nparticipating countries to uphold the principles of free trade--and for \nagriculture trade that means abiding by the international science \nstandards that set important standards for animal, plant and human \nsafety.\n  Prior to the discovery of a case of native-born BSE in a cow that \nnever entered the food supply, we enjoyed this kind of trading \nrelationship with Japan. However, Japan has chosen to ignore \ninternationally recognized science and has instead based their food \nsafety on emotional, politically-driven arguments. And, this comes at a \nhigh price for the American beef industry.\n  Since December 2003, the U.S. beef industry has experienced roughly \n$6 billion in cumulative economic losses--in current annual economic \ntrade terms, this is about $3.1 billion a year.\n  We've been patient, but with this kind of economic loss, the American \nbeef industry cannot afford to wait any longer.\n  I will not stand idly by while politics and posturing drive our trade \nrelationships.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation to send a message in \nthe strongest way possible, that free trade is a two-way street. More \nimportantly, in the context of the pending negotiations in the Doha \nRound of the World Trade Organization, I urge my colleagues to support \nthis bill because it sends the message to American producers that we \nwill stand up for American agriculture in our trade negotiations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/28/senate-section/article/S12051-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12051-S12053]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE PATH FORWARD\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have a recent \nspeech I delivered on Iraq printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           [October 26, 2005]\n\n                          ``The Path Forward''\n\n                        (Georgetown University)\n\n       A few weeks ago I departed Iraq from Mosul. Three Senators \n     and staff were gathered in the forward part of a C-130. In \n     the middle of the cavernous cargo hold was a simple, aluminum \n     coffin with a small American flag draped over it. We were \n     bringing another American soldier home to his family and \n     final resting place.\n       The starkness of his coffin in the center of the hold, the \n     silence except for the din of the engines, was a real time \n     cold reminder of the consequences of decisions for which we \n     Senators share responsibility.\n       As we arrived in Kuwait, a larger flag was transferred to \n     fully cover his coffin and we joined graves registration \n     personnel in giving him an honor guard as he was \n     ceremoniously carried from the plane to a waiting truck. When \n     the doors clunked shut, I wondered why all of America would \n     not be allowed to see him arrive at Dover Air Force Base \n     instead of hiding him from a nation that deserves to mourn \n     together in truth and in the light of day. His lonely journey \n     compels all of us to come to grips with our choices in Iraq.\n       Now more than 2,000 brave Americans have given their lives, \n     and several hundred thousand more have done everything in \n     their power to wade through the ongoing internal civil strife \n     in Iraq. An Iraq which increasingly is what it was not before \n     the war--a breeding ground for homegrown terrorists and a \n     magnet for foreign terrorists. We are entering a make or \n     break six month period, and I want to talk about the steps we \n     must take if we hope to bring our troops home within a \n     reasonable timeframe from an Iraq that's not permanently torn \n     by irrepressible conflict.\n       It is never easy to discuss what has gone wrong while our \n     troops are in constant danger. I know this dilemma first-\n     hand. After serving in war, I returned home to offer my own \n     personal voice of dissent. I did so because I believed \n     strongly that we owed it to those risking their lives to \n     speak truth to power. We still do.\n       In fact, while some say we can't ask tough questions \n     because we are at war, I say no--in a time of war we must ask \n     the hardest questions of all. It's essential if we want to \n     correct our course and do what's right for our troops instead \n     of repeating the same mistakes over and over again. No matter \n     what the President says, asking tough questions isn't \n     pessimism, it's patriotism.\n       Our troops have served with stunning bravery and resolve. \n     The nobility of their service to country can never be \n     diminished by the mistakes of politicians. American families \n     who have lost, or who fear the loss, of their loved ones \n     deserve to know the truth about what we have asked them to \n     do, what we are doing to complete the mission, and what we \n     are doing to prevent our forces from being trapped in an \n     endless quagmire.\n       Some people would rather not have that discussion. They'd \n     rather revise and rewrite the story of our involvement in \n     Iraq for the history books. Tragically, that's become \n     standard fare from an administration that doesn't acknowledge \n     facts generally, whether they are provided by scientists, \n     whistle-blowers, journalists, military leaders, or the common \n     sense of every citizen. At a time when many worry that we \n     have become a society of moral relativists, too few worry \n     that we have a government of factual relativists.\n       Let's be straight about Iraq. Saddam Hussein was a brutal \n     dictator who deserves his own special place in hell. But that \n     was not the reason America went to war.\n       The country and the Congress were misled into war. I regret \n     that we were not given the truth; as I said more than a year \n     ago, knowing what we know now, I would not have gone to war \n     in Iraq. And knowing now the full measure of the Bush \n     Administration's duplicity and incompetence, I doubt there \n     are many members of Congress who would give them the \n     authority they abused so badly. I know I would not. The truth \n     is, if the Bush Administration had come to the United States \n     Senate and acknowledged there was no ``slam dunk case'' that \n     Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, acknowledged \n     that Iraq was not connected to 9/11, there never would have \n     even been a vote to authorize the use of force--just as \n     there's no vote today to invade North Korea, Iran, Cuba, or a \n     host of regimes we rightfully despise.\n       I understand that as much as we might wish it, we can't \n     rewind the tape of history. There is, as Robert Kennedy once \n     said, 'enough blame to go around,' and I accept my share of \n     the responsibility. But the mistakes of the past, no matter \n     who made them, are no justification for marching ahead into a \n     future of miscalculations and misjudgments and the loss of \n     American lives with no end in sight. We each have a \n     responsibility, to our country and our conscience, to be \n     honest about where we should go from here. It is time for \n     those of us who believe in a better course to say so plainly \n     and unequivocally.\n       We are where we are. The President's flippant ``bring it \n     on'' taunt to the insurgents\n\n[[Page S12052]]\n\n     has found a meaning beyond his wildest expectations, a \n     painful reality for troops who went for too long without \n     protective armor. We have traded a dictator for a chaos that \n     has left America less secure, and the mission the President \n     once declared accomplished remains perilously incomplete.\n       To set a new course, we must be strong, smart, and honest. \n     As we learned painfully during the Vietnam War, no president \n     can sustain a war without the support of the American people. \n     In the case of Iraq, their patience is frayed and nearly to \n     the breaking point because Americans will not tolerate our \n     troops giving their lives without a clear strategy, and will \n     not tolerate vague platitudes or rosy scenarios when real \n     answers are urgently needed.\n       It's time for leaders to be honest that if we do not change \n     course, there is the prospect of indefinite, even endless \n     conflict--a fate untenable for our troops, and a future \n     unacceptable to the American people and the Iraqis who pray \n     for the day when a stable Iraq will belong to Iraqis alone.\n       The path forward will not be easy. The administration's \n     incompetence and unwillingness to listen has made the task \n     that much harder, and reduced what we can expect to \n     accomplish. But there is a way forward that gives us the best \n     chance both to salvage a difficult situation in Iraq, and to \n     save American and Iraqi lives. With so much at stake, we must \n     follow it.\n       We must begin by acknowledging that our options in Iraq \n     today are not what they should be, or could have been.\n       The reason is simple. This Administration hitched their \n     wagon to ideologues, excluding those who dared to tell the \n     truth, even leaders of their own party and the uniformed \n     military.\n       When after September 11th, flags flew from porches across \n     America and foreign newspaper headlines proclaimed ``We're \n     all Americans now,'' the Administration could have kept the \n     world united, but they chose not to. And they were wrong. \n     Instead, they pushed allies away, isolated America, and lost \n     leverage we desperately need today.\n       When they could have demanded and relied on accurate \n     instead of manipulated intelligence, they chose not to. They \n     were wrong--and instead they sacrificed our credibility at \n     home and abroad.\n       When they could have given the inspectors time to discover \n     whether Saddam Hussein actually had weapons of mass \n     destruction, when they could have paid attention to \n     Ambassador Wilson's report, they chose not to. And they were \n     wrong. Instead they attacked him, and they attacked his wife \n     to justify attacking Iraq. We don't know yet whether this \n     will prove to be an indictable offense in a court of law, but \n     for it, and for misleading a nation into war, they will be \n     indicted in the high court of history. History will judge the \n     invasion of Iraq one of the greatest foreign policy \n     misadventures of all time.\n       But the mistakes were not limited to the decision to \n     invade. They mounted, one upon another.\n       When they could have listened to General Shinseki and put \n     in enough troops to maintain order, they chose not to. They \n     were wrong. When they could have learned from George Herbert \n     Walker Bush and built a genuine global coalition, they chose \n     not to. They were wrong. When they could have implemented a \n     detailed State Department plan for reconstructing post-Saddam \n     Iraq, they chose not to. And they were wrong again. When they \n     could have protected American forces by guarding Saddam \n     Hussein's ammo dumps where there were weapons of individual \n     destruction, they exposed our young men and women to the ammo \n     that now maims and kills them because they chose not to act. \n     And they were wrong. When they could have imposed immediate \n     order and structure in Baghdad after the fall of Saddam, \n     Rumsfeld shrugged his shoulders, said Baghdad was safer than \n     Washington, D.C. and chose not to act. He was wrong. When the \n     Administration could have kept an Iraqi army selectively \n     intact, they chose not to. They were wrong. When they could \n     have kept an entire civil structure functioning to deliver \n     basic services to Iraqi citizens, they chose not to. They \n     were wrong. When they could have accepted the offers of the \n     United Nations and individual countries to provide on the \n     ground peacekeepers and reconstruction assistance, they chose \n     not to. They were wrong. When they should have leveled with \n     the American people that the insurgency had grown, they chose \n     not to. Vice President Cheney even absurdly claimed that the \n     ``insurgency was in its last throes.'' He was wrong.\n       Now after all these mistakes, the Administration accuses \n     anyone who proposes a better course of wanting to cut and \n     run. But we are in trouble today precisely because of a \n     policy of cut and run. This administration made the wrong \n     choice to cut and run from sound intelligence and good \n     diplomacy; to cut and run from the best military advice; to \n     cut and run from sensible war time planning; to cut and run \n     from their responsibility to properly arm and protect our \n     troops; to cut and run from history's lessons about the \n     Middle East; to cut and run from common sense.\n       And still today they cut and run from the truth.\n       This difficult road traveled demands the unvarnished truth \n     about the road ahead.\n       To those who suggest we should withdraw all troops \n     immediately--I say No. A precipitous withdrawal would invite \n     civil and regional chaos and endanger our own security. But \n     to those who rely on the overly simplistic phrase ``we will \n     stay as long as it takes,'' who pretend this is primarily a \n     war against Al Qaeda, and who offer halting, sporadic, \n     diplomatic engagement, I also say--No, that will only lead us \n     into a quagmire.\n       The way forward in Iraq is not to pull out precipitously or \n     merely promise to stay ``as long as it takes.'' To undermine \n     the insurgency, we must instead simultaneously pursue both a \n     political settlement and the withdrawal of American combat \n     forces linked to specific, responsible benchmarks. At the \n     first benchmark, the completion of the December elections, we \n     can start the process of reducing our forces by withdrawing \n     20,000 troops over the course of the holidays.\n       The Administration must immediately give Congress and the \n     American people a detailed plan for the transfer of military \n     and police responsibilities on a sector by sector basis to \n     Iraqis so the majority of our combat forces can be withdrawn. \n     No more shell games, no more false reports of progress, but \n     specific and measurable goals.\n       It is true that our soldiers increasingly fight side by \n     side with Iraqis willing to put their lives on the line for a \n     better future. But history shows that guns alone do not end \n     an insurgency. The real struggle in Iraq--Sunni versus \n     Shiia--will only be settled by a political solution, and no \n     political solution can be achieved when the antagonists can \n     rely on the indefinite large scale presence of occupying \n     American combat troops.\n       In fact, because we failed to take advantage of the \n     momentum of our military victory, because we failed to \n     deliver services and let Iraqis choose their leaders early \n     on, our military presence in vast and visible numbers has \n     become part of the problem, not the solution.\n       And our generals understand this. General George Casey, our \n     top military commander in Iraq, recently told Congress that \n     our large military presence ``feeds the notion of \n     occupation'' and ``extends the amount of time that it will \n     take for Iraqi security forces to become self-reliant.'' And \n     Richard Nixon's Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird, breaking a \n     thirty year silence, writes, ''Our presence is what feeds the \n     insurgency, and our gradual withdrawal would feed the \n     confidence and the ability of average Iraqis to stand up to \n     the insurgency.'' No wonder the Sovereignty Committee of the \n     Iraqi Parliament is already asking for a timetable for \n     withdrawal of our troops; without this, Iraqis believe Iraq \n     will never be its own country.\n       We must move aggressively to reduce popular support for the \n     insurgency fed by the perception of American occupation. An \n     open-ended declaration to stay 'as long as it takes' lets \n     Iraqi factions maneuver for their own political advantage by \n     making us stay as long as they want, and it becomes an excuse \n     for billions of American tax dollars to be sent to Iraq and \n     siphoned off into the coffers of cronyism and corruption.\n       It will be hard for this Administration, but it is \n     essential to acknowledge that the insurgency will not be \n     defeated unless our troop levels are drawn down, starting \n     immediately after successful elections in December. The draw \n     down of troops should be tied not to an arbitrary timetable, \n     but to a specific timetable for transfer of political and \n     security responsibility to Iraqis and realignment of our \n     troop deployment. That timetable must be real and strict. The \n     goal should be to withdraw the bulk of American combat forces \n     by the end of next year. If the Administration does its work \n     correctly, that is achievable.\n       Our strategy must achieve a political solution that \n     deprives the Sunni-dominated insurgency of support by giving \n     the Sunnis a stake in the future of their country. The \n     Constitution, opposed by more than two thirds of Sunnis, has \n     postponed and even exacerbated the fundamental crisis of \n     Iraq. The Sunnis want a strong secular national government \n     that fairly distributes oil revenues. Shiites want to control \n     their own region and resources in a loosely united Islamic \n     state. And Kurds simply want to be left alone. Until \n     sufficient compromise is hammered out, a Sunni base cannot be \n     created that isolates the hard core Baathists and jihaadists \n     and defuses the insurgency.\n       The Administration must use all of the leverage in \n     America's arsenal--our diplomacy, the presence of our troops, \n     and our reconstruction money--to convince Shiites and Kurds \n     to address legitimate Sunni concerns and to make Sunnis \n     accept the reality that they will no longer dominate Iraq. We \n     cannot and should not do this alone.\n       The Administration must bring to the table the full weight \n     of all of Iraq's Sunni neighbors. They also have a large \n     stake in a stable Iraq. Instead of just telling us that Iraq \n     is falling apart, as the Saudi foreign minister did recently, \n     they must do their part to put it back together. We've proven \n     ourselves to be a strong ally to many nations in the region. \n     Now it's their turn to do their part.\n       The administration must immediately call a conference of \n     Iraq's neighbors, Britain, Turkey and other key NATO allies, \n     and Russia. All of these countries have influence and ties to \n     various parties in Iraq. Together, we must implement a \n     collective strategy to bring the parties in Iraq to a \n     sustainable political compromise. This must include obtaining \n     mutual security guarantees among Iraqis themselves. Shiite \n     and Kurdish leaders need to make a commitment not to \n     perpetrate a bloodbath against Sunnis in the post-election \n     period. In turn, Sunni leaders must end support for the \n     insurgents, including those who are targeting Shiites. And \n     the\n\n[[Page S12053]]\n\n     Kurds must explicitly commit themselves not to declare \n     independence.\n       To enlist the support of Iraq's Sunni neighbors, we should \n     commit to a new regional security structure that strengthens \n     the security of the countries in the region and the wider \n     community of nations. This requires a phased process \n     including improved security assistance programs, joint \n     exercises, and participation by countries both outside and \n     within the Middle East.\n       Ambassador Khalilzad is doing a terrific job trying broker \n     a better deal between the Iraqi parties. But he can't do it \n     alone. The President should immediately appoint a high level \n     envoy to maximize our diplomacy in Iraq and the region.\n       Showing Sunnis the benefits that await them if they \n     continue to participate in the process of building Iraq can \n     go a long way toward achieving stability. We should press \n     these countries to set up a reconstruction fund specifically \n     for the majority Sunni areas. It's time for them to deliver \n     on their commitments to provide funds to Iraq. Even short-\n     term improvements, like providing electricity and supplying \n     diesel fuel--an offer that the Saudis have made but have yet \n     to fulfill--can make a real difference.\n       We need to jump start our own lagging reconstruction \n     efforts by providing the necessary civilian personnel to do \n     the job, standing up civil-military reconstruction teams \n     throughout the country, streamlining the disbursement of \n     funds to the provinces so they can deliver services, \n     expanding job creation programs, and strengthening the \n     capacity of government ministries.\n       We must make it clear now that we do not want permanent \n     military bases in Iraq, or a large combat force on Iraqi soil \n     indefinitely. And as we withdraw our combat troops, we should \n     be prepared to keep a substantially reduced level of American \n     forces in Iraq, at the request of the Iraqi government, for \n     the purpose of training their security forces. Some combat \n     ready American troops will still be needed to safeguard the \n     Americans engaged in that training, but they should be there \n     to do that and to provide a back stop to Iraqi efforts, not \n     to do the fighting for Iraqis.\n       Simultaneously, the President needs to put the training of \n     Iraqi security forces on a six month wartime footing and \n     ensure that the Iraqi government has the budget to deploy \n     them. The Administration must stop using the requirement that \n     troops be trained in-country as an excuse for refusing offers \n     made by Egypt, Jordan, France and Germany to do more.\n       This week, long standing suspicions of Syrian complicity in \n     destabilizing Lebanon were laid bare by the community of \n     nations. And we know Syria has failed to take the aggressive \n     steps necessary to stop former Baathists and foreign fighters \n     from using its territory as a transit route into Iraq. The \n     Administration must prod the new Iraqi government to ask for \n     a multinational force to help protect Iraq's borders until a \n     capable national army is formed. Such a force, if sanctioned \n     by the United Nations Security Council, could attract \n     participation by Iraq's neighbors and countries like India \n     and would be a critical step in stemming the tide of \n     insurgents and money into Iraq.\n       Finally, and without delay, we must fundamentally alter the \n     deployment of American troops. While Special Operations must \n     continue to pursue specific intelligence leads, the vast \n     majority of our own troops should be in rear guard, \n     garrisoned status for security backup. We do not need to send \n     young Americans on search and destroy missions that invite \n     alienation and deepen the risks they face. Iraqis should \n     police Iraqis. Iraqis should search Iraqi homes. Iraqis \n     should stand up for Iraq.\n       We will never be as safe as we should be if Iraq continues \n     to distract us from the most important war we must win--the \n     war on Osama bin Laden, Al Qaeda, and the terrorists that are \n     resurfacing even in Afghanistan. These are the make or break \n     months for Iraq. The President must take a new course, and \n     hold Iraqis accountable. If the President still refuses, \n     Congress must insist on a change in policy. If we do take \n     these steps, there is no reason this difficult process can \n     not be completed in 12-15 months. There is no reason Iraq \n     cannot be sufficiently stable, no reason the majority of our \n     combat troops can't soon be on their way home, and no reason \n     we can't take on a new role in Iraq, as an ally not an \n     occupier, training Iraqis to defend themselves. Only then \n     will we have provided leadership equal to our soldiers' \n     sacrifice--and that is what they deserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/28/senate-section/article/S12053-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12053]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  NATIONAL DISABILITY EMPLOYMENT MONTH\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this October marks the 60th anniversary of \nNational Disability Employment Awareness Month, and gives us an \nopportunity to recognize and celebrate the contributions that employees \nwith disabilities have made to the American workforce.\n  The effort to help our fellow Americans understand these important \ncontributions began in 1945, when Congress designated the first week in \nOctober each year as National Employ the Physically Handicapped Week. \nIn 1962, the name was changed to include all employees with \ndisabilities. And, in 1988, Congress expanded the designated week to a \nfull month, and changed the name to National Disability Employment \nAwareness Month.\n  National Disability Employment Awareness Month is a time to celebrate \nthe progress we have made in opening the doors of opportunity for \nindividuals with disabilities. People with disabilities--as all \npeople--have unique abilities, talents, and aptitudes. And there is no \nquestion that our nation is better, fairer, and richer when we make \nfull use of those gifts.\n  This July, our Nation celebrated the 15th anniversary of the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act--the landmark civil rights law securing \nthe rights of people with disabilities. As the chief sponsor of the ADA \nin Congress, I remember the day it was signed into law--June 26, 1990--\nas one of the proudest in my entire legislative career. And, just as \nmany predicted, the ADA has taken its place among the great civil \nrights laws in our Nation's history. Today, the impact of the ADA is \nall around us, in countless facets of our daily lives.\n  Yet we still have much work to do to increase employment \nopportunities for people with disabilities. Long-term employment, \ncareer advancement, and equal pay continue to be challenging for many \nworkers with disabilities. Most importantly, we need to improve the \nemployment rate of persons with disabilities. The gap between the \nemployment rates of working-age people with and without disabilities \nwas more than 40 percentage points in 2004.\n  There are many factors that contribute to this gap, including \ndisincentives, transportation issues, and outdated stereotypes about \npeople with disabilities. But the end result is unfortunate and \nunacceptable. Most people with disabilities want to work; they want to \nbe self-supporting and independent. As a government and as a society, \nwe need to encourage employers to hire people with disabilities. We \nneed to support creative job accommodations so we expand employment \nopportunities.\n  Misconceptions and apprehensions about hiring people with physical or \nmental disabilities continue to exist as a barrier to progress. We need \nto get out the truth, which is that most workers with disabilities \nrequire no special accommodations, while the cost for those who do is \noften minimal. Moreover, research amply shows that employees with \ndisabilities have above-average records in attendance, job \ndependability, performance, and safety.\n  Breaking down these persistent attitudinal barriers requires a \ncooperative, sustained, and consistent effort. A new generation of \nyoung people with disabilities is growing up in America today--\ngraduating from high school, going to college, and preparing to \nparticipate fully in the workplace. These young people have a right to \nmake the most of their potential. Likewise, America must make the most \nof their intellect, talents, and abilities.\n  So this month, as we celebrate the 60th anniversary of National \nDisability Employment Month, let us rededicate ourselves to breaking \ndown the workplace barriers--physical and psychological--that continue \nto stand in the way of people with disabilities. Our goal must be to \nmake the American dream accessible to all Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/28/senate-section/article/S12053-2", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12053-S12054]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 HONORING THE SERVICE OF BARBARA BERGER\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I would like to honor a remarkable \nindividual today on the occasion of her retirement from the U.S. Senate \nRecording Studio. Barbara Berger, or Barb, as she is known here in the \nSenate, is celebrating her last day of a career spanning 33 years. Barb \nhas been here longer than any Senator save four. She has seen 320 \nSenators come and go from this body and served under 13 Sergeants-At-\nArms. Not only has she seen many of us come and go, she has also \nwitnessed the astounding technological transformation in media that has \noccurred in the past three decades. In 1972, when Barb began as a \nreceptionist in the front office of the Recording Studio, radio and \nfilm were the only mediums of communication available to the Senate, \nand floor proceedings were not televised yet.\n  I haven't been here as long as some of my colleagues, but over the \npast 7 years, Barb has been the gracious smile and distinguished and \nprofessional face\n\n[[Page S12054]]\n\nof the Recording Studio. Her poise, civility and shining personality \npermeate the office and make working with them an absolute pleasure for \nme. Her institutional knowledge and memory and quiet authority provide \nme and all the staff and Members who work with the studio reassurance \nthat our messages will be handled with care and expertise.\n  American historian Barbara Tuch\nman said:\n\n       Although I know we have already grown accustomed to less \n     beauty, less elegance, less excellence, yet perversely I have \n     confidence in the opposite of egalitarianism: in the \n     competence and excellence of the best among us. The urge for \n     the best is an element of humankind as inherent as the \n     heartbeat. It may be crushed temporarily but it cannot be \n     eliminated. We will always have pride in accomplishment, the \n     charm of fine things . . . As long as people exist, some will \n     always strive for the best. And some will attain it.\n\n  Barb epitomizes this competence and excellence in her work, and \nbeauty in her kind and graceful spirit. My staff and I will most \ncertainly miss her and I wish her well in retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/28/senate-section/article/S12054-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12054]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                IN SPECIAL RECOGNITION OF ANN S.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Ann \nSimpson for her selection to receive the prestigious University of \nWyoming Art Museum National Advisory Board President's Award on \nNovember 5, 2005.\n  John Paul Richter once said, ``Art is not the bread, but the wine of \nlife.'' In many ways this is true, but art not only enriches our \nquality of life, it also plays an instrumental role in human \ndevelopment. Art enhances cognitive skills and encourages creative \nexpression. Art helps us understand different worldviews and \nperspectives. For these reasons and more, art must be fostered in our \ncommunities and across the Nation.\n  In line with this mission, the University of Wyoming Art Museum \nNational Advisory Board established the President's Award in 1995. This \nspecial award is to be presented to an individual, group or \norganization for their lifetime commitment to the arts in Wyoming. \nThose selected must be an active advocate of the arts, be recognized as \na patron of and major contributor to the arts, have played an \ninstrumental role in the creation or development of a specific art \nprogram and/or art initiative, and embody a strong commitment to \nfurthering/developing arts in Wyoming. Ann Simpson is an excellent \nchoice to receive this distinguished award.\n  A Wyoming native, Ann is a long-time supporter of the arts throughout \nour State. In 1989, Ann received the Wyoming Arts Council Governor's \nArts Award for her outstanding service to the arts in Wyoming. Her \npassion for the arts is further illustrated by her work on the Ford's \nTheater Board, the University of Wyoming Art Museum Advisory Board, and \nsignificant financial contributions to art programs throughout the \nState and Nation. In fact, Ann worked with the Wyoming State \nlegislature to secure a National Endowment for the Arts funding match \nof $3.5 million in order to initiate construction of the Centennial \nComplex which currently houses the University of Wyoming Art Museum. \nShe was also responsible for cultivating and stewarding a $2.5 million \ndonation to the University of Wyoming Art Museum, their largest \nendowment gift to date.\n  Ann has always recognized the importance of art and art education to \nour society. In fact, one of her most notable contributions to our \nState is an art outreach program called the Artmobile. The Artmobile is \na traveling exhibition which visits communities throughout the State of \nWyoming in order to provide our residents with exposure to diverse \nforms of visual art. The program incorporates artwork from the \nUniversity of Wyoming's permanent collection and by Wyoming artists. \nDiscussions of the exhibition are typically followed by hands-on art \nactivities with the Artmobile curator. The program is provided free of \ncharge and each presentation is tailored to engage its particular \naudience.\n  In 1995, the Artmobile was renamed for Ann in recognition of her \ntremendous efforts on behalf of the program. To this day, Ann works \ndiligently to increase public awareness of the valuable service the \n``Ann Simpson Artmobile'' provides and to enrich the lives of all \nWyomingites with art. Ann Simpson is truly deserving of the University \nof Wyoming Art Museum National Advisory Board President's Award.\n  Mr. President, Ann's husband, former Senator Alan Simpson, and I grew \nup a stone's throw from one another, so I have had the pleasure of \nknowing the Simpsons for most of my life. Al and Ann are a remarkable \ncouple with endless energy and enthusiasm for our great State. My wife \nSusan and I consider them both dear friends, and we extend our most \nsincere congratulations for Ann's extraordinary achievement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/28/senate-section/article/S12054-2", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12054]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/28/senate-section/article/S12054-3", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12054]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a withdrawal which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/28/senate-section/article/S12054-4", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12054]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          ENROLLED BILL SIGNED\n\n  At 10 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered by \nMs. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker has \nsigned the following enrolled bill:\n\n       S. 172.

A bill to redesignate the project for navigation, Saco \nRiver, Maine as an anchorage area; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill for the \nCity of Saco, ME that concerns the town's ability to allow the mooring \nof boats on the Saco River. The bill changes the turning basin into an \nanchorage while managing a 50 foot channel within the anchorage. The \ntown was not aware that it was in violation because of 21 moorings \nlocated in the Saco River Federal Navigational Project. In an effort to \neliminate this encroachment, city officials have requested a \nmodification or deauthorization of the Federal Navigational Project to \nresolve the issue.\n  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has suggested language that re-\ndesignates the maneuvering basin into an anchorage area that will meet \nthe needs of the community. The language, which I hope will be included \nin the Water Resources Development Act in this Congress, will allow for \nthe legal moorage of boats, the fairway for which would be maintained \nby the City of Saco as is customary for towns with Federal anchorages. \nIt is my understanding that the two mayors of the cities involved along \nwith the Saco Yacht Club have agreed to the Corps' language.\n      By Mr. WARNER:\n  S. 1939. A bill to extend the suspension of duty on hexanedioic acid, \npolymer with 1,3-benzenedimethanamine; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to extend \nthe temporary duty suspension for imports of Nylon MXD6, hexanedioic \nacid, polymer with 1,3-benzenedimethanamine. This product, which is not \nmanufactured in the United States at this time, serves as the favored \noption for food packaging and other multifunction packaging due to its \ntough, transparent properties.\n  It is customary for the Congress every few years to consider \nrelatively minor technical changes to certain trade proposals as one \nomnibus bill. The most recent of these bills was the Miscellaneous \nTrade and Technical Changes Act of 2004. For a proposal to be included \nin the legislation, the House Ways and Means Committee, Senate Finance \nCommittee, and International Trade Commission all have to conclude that \nthe proposal is noncontroversial. As one of the determining factors for \na duty suspension request to be considered noncontroversial, no \ndomestic production of the commodity may exist, or it may not be at a \nsufficient level to satisfy domestic demand.\n  As I mentioned before, Nylon MXD6 is not produced in the United \nStates, and as a result, a temporary duty suspension was awarded to \nimports of Nylon MXD6 under the Miscellaneous Trade and Technical \nCorrections Act of 2004. However, this suspension is due to expire on \nDecember 31, 2006. While this sunset may sound far from now, no \ndomestic production is expected to exist by then nor is it expected to \nexist for a few years afterwards, causing uncertainty for future \nproduction.\n  The current duty suspension for this import has been a key element in \nlowering the costs of domestic production of commodities containing \nNylon MXD6. The bill I introduce today would extend the current \nsuspension through December 31, 2008, which will provide manufacturers \nthe certainty they need to plan for their future.\n  In closing, I hope my colleagues in the Senate will join with me in \nsupport of this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/28/senate-section/article/S12055-4", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12055-S12056]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, next week, the Senate will consider the \ndeficit reduction bill, a bill I spoke on in my opening comments today, \na bill about which I am very excited. It answers the question of doing \nwhat is right, what the American people expect, and that is getting our \ndeficit down, reducing the deficit by slowing down, by reducing that \nmandatory or entitlement spending growth.\n  We will complete action on that important measure on Thursday or \nFriday. We will have a very long day on Thursday. I encourage our \ncolleagues not to schedule anything else on Thursday because we will be \nvoting a lot on the floor of the Senate and will do so in the fashion \nthat we voted this week--having votes scheduled and strictly cutting \noff votes if Members are not here.\n  Under the time agreement that was reached last night, we will have \nplenty of time for debate each day with many votes over the course of \nthe week. I urge my colleagues--and I feel I say this again and again--\nto be judicious in their offering of amendments. We will work with our \ncolleagues on the time. We want to have and will have plenty of time \nfor debate and amendments. We do not need to bring every amendment to \nthe floor to make a message when it is pretty clear what the outcome \nwill be.\n  Again, we will protect everybody's right and opportunity to have full \ndebate and vote accordingly, but I ask people to judiciously consider \nwhat amendments they bring to the floor.\n  Next week we will also address the Agriculture appropriations \nconference report under a very short time agreement. We will also \naddress any other conference reports available, as well as executive \nnominations that are ready for Senate action.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/28/senate-section/article/S12056-4", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12056]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               ROSA PARKS\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, over the course of the weekend, the Capitol \nwill be busy. As people know, on Tuesday of this week, civil rights \nicon Rosa Parks passed away in her Detroit home at the age of 92. \nThroughout her life, she was a champion, an activist, a true hero, and \nhas left a legacy that all of us will carry forward and pass on to our \nchildren and future generations because of that simple act--not so \nsimple act, but that dramatic act of refusal to give up her seat on a \nMontgomery bus that was the was the catalyst for that historic civil \nrights movement that and remade our Nation.\n  Last night, it was our honor in this body to pass a resolution to \nallow the remains of Rosa Parks to lie in state on Sunday and Monday in \nthe Capitol Rotunda. The House is expected to ratify a similar \nresolution today. Citizens from all around the country and really all \naround the globe, I am sure, will come to pay their respects. Rosa \nParks will be forever etched in history as a testament to how one \nperson with courage can literally change the world.\n  Although shortly we will be closing, at this time, I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/28/senate-section/article/S12056-5", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12056-S12057]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n      NOMINATION OF MICHAEL WYNNE TO BE SECRETARY OF THE AIR FORCE\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
