Mr. President, I rise to discuss an amendment that I, \nalong with my friend from Arizona, Senator Jon Kyl, have introduced. \nThis amendment represents a practical alternative to S. 359, which has \nbeen introduced by Senator Craig, commonly known as the AgJOBS bill. My \nhometown of Moultrie, GA, is located in Colquitt County. It is one of \nthe most diversified agricultural counties in the country and often \nreferred to as the most diversified agricultural county east of the \nMississippi River. During my 26 years of practicing law, before I came \nto Congress I represented farmers who grow almost every kind of crop \nthere is. These farmers, as do most farmers in America, depend very \nheavily upon migrant labor for their means of planting, harvesting, and \ngetting their crops to market.\n  Up the road from my hometown is the Georgia peach growing area, which \nalso produces most of the pecans that are grown in the country today. \nSo, firsthand, I recognize the need for a stable and legal agricultural \nworkforce.\n  From my perspective as a former member of the House Permanent Select \nCommittee on Intelligence and my present position as chairman of the \nSenate Agricultural Committee, I understand that our country's need for \na secure and reliable domestic food supply is an issue of national \nsecurity. This legislation addresses those needs without providing \namnesty to our current illegal agricultural workforce. Instead, we take \na two-pronged approach. First, this legislation modernizes and \nstreamlines the current H-2A program. Secondly, it creates a temporary \nagricultural guest worker program called the blue card program.\n\n[[Page S3768]]\n\n  Let me give a little background on the present H-2A program and why \nso few agricultural employers utilize it.\n  The H-2A program is a program for non-immigrant, work-related, \ntemporary visas authorized by the Immigration and Naturalization Act. \nIt is regulated and administered by the United States Department of \nLabor. Although its purpose is to allow producers to have access to an \nadequate legal seasonal workforce when domestic workers are \nunavailable, participation in the H-2A program is time consuming, \nbureaucratic, and inefficient.\n  A producer must complete a complicated application process which \ninvolves sequential approval by a State agency and three Federal \nagencies. As presently designed, administered, and enforced, H-2A \nemployers must complete a great deal of paperwork during the \napplication process. They must then coordinate and track their workers \nthrough a Bureau of Customs and Immigration Services and State \nDepartment visa approval system. Once the workers are present on the \nfarm, these employers must also comply with all aspects of the \nImmigration and Naturalization Act, the Migrant Seasonal Protection \nWorker Act, the Fair Labor Standards Act, and various OSHA regulations \nregarding housing and field sanitation.\n  Redtape aside, another serious issue with the current H-2A program is \nthat it requires employers to pay the Adverse Effect Wage Rate, which \nis determined by an archaic survey conducted since the 1930s. This \nsurvey was never designed to capture prevailing wages within a specific \ngeographical area nor does it specify the type of work that is being \ndone for that wage. In my home State of Georgia, the present wage an \nemployer must pay for an unskilled farm worker is $8.30 per hour. This \nwage is in addition to free housing and reimbursement for all \ntransportation costs. All of these expenses make it very difficult for \nthese H-2A employers to compete with producers who do not or cannot use \nthe program and who then pay workers they are able to find between \n$5.15 and $6.15 per hour.\n  We have millions of illegal workers on farms in this country. We have \na program that will allow growers to use legal workers. The fact so few \nagricultural employers take advantage of H-2A is simple. It is too \ncomplicated, too costly, and much too litigious.\n  The legislation that Senator Kyl and I have introduced simplifies the \nH-2A program by streamlining the application process to involve fewer \nGovernment entities in the final approval. Under this bill, employers \nwho wish to use H-2A workers will go through an attestation process, \nrather than a lengthy bureaucratic labor certification process. \nEmployers will be allowed to attest to the Department of Homeland \nSecurity that they have conducted the required recruitment and were \nunable to find an adequate number of domestic workers to fill their \nlabor needs. The Department of Labor will maintain its roll as an \nauditor to punish those employers who willfully violate the conditions \nthat must be met in the attestation process to obtain H-2A workers. We \nhave increased the penalties to ensure those who continue to employ \nillegal workers rather than utilize this updated program will pay the \ncosts.\n  This legislation also addresses the Adverse Effect Wage rate, which \nmany contend has discouraged employers from using the H-2A program. \nInstead, we move to a wage rate that is more market-oriented and a \nprevailing wage for each region of the country.\n  Another important aspect of this legislation is it clearly states \nthat the Legal Services Corporation cannot represent or provide \nservices to a person or entity representing any alien, unless that \nalien is physically present in the United States. This clarification is \nneeded because of the longstanding and well-documented abuses by the \nLegal Services Corporation in filing frivolous lawsuits against \nproducers who employ H-2A workers.\n\n  By streamlining and modernizing the H-2A program, we can make it \neasier and more attractive to U.S. agricultural employers and minimize \nthe attraction of using illegal labor.\n  The second part of our legislation targets the illegal population in \nthis country with the creation of a blue card program. The blue card \nprogram is an innovative, new temporary guest worker program. The idea \nof it is to allow employers who cannot find an adequate domestic \nworkforce to petition on behalf of an immigrant who is currently \nillegally here to receive a blue card or a temporary status in this \ncountry. The petitioning process will require the alien to submit his \nor her biographical information along with two biometric identifiers to \nthe Department of Homeland Security. This way, we can be sure we are \nnot bestowing the blue card status on a potential terrorist or an alien \nwith a criminal past.\n  The blue card itself will be a machine-readable, tamper-resistant \ndocument that will be capable of confirming, for any immigration \nofficial who needs to know, the person holding the blue card is who the \ncard claims he or she is, and the blue card worker is authorized to \nwork in agricultural employment in the United States and the \nauthorization has not expired.\n  Because the blue card workers will maintain these secure \nidentification documents, they can freely travel between the United \nStates and their home countries. This will allow the blue card workers \nto maintain ties to their lives and families at home.\n  It is important to note that by setting the Blue Card Program up on \nan employer-petition basis, the program has a natural cap built in--one \nthat responds to the U.S. market and our agricultural labor needs. \nEmployers will only petition for as many workers as needed to fill \ntheir labor needs. This is unlike the AgJOBS bill which allows illegal \naliens to self-petition.\n  Once an alien receives a blue card, he or she is eligible to work in \nthe United States for up to three years. The blue card may be renewed \nup to two times, each at an employer's petitioning. At the end of the \nsecond renewal, the blue card worker must return to his or her home \ncountry, or country of last residence. This is important. The blue card \nprovides no path to U.S. citizenship, which is contrary to what the \nAgJOBS bill does. Any blue card worker who wishes to become a U.S. \ncitizen is certainly allowed to do so. All that worker has to do is \nrevoke his or her blue card, return to his or her home country or \ncountry of last residence for at least 1 year and apply through the \nnormal process just like everyone else.\n  An approved blue card worker will receive all the protections U.S. \nworkers will receive. While blue cards are available only to those \naliens who work in the agricultural field, this legislation expands a \ntraditional definition of agriculture in recognition of the \ninterdependence on various occupations within the field of agriculture. \nBy including packagers, processors, and landscapers, we not only \nencourage a larger percentage of our illegal population to come \nforward, submit to Homeland Security background checks, and get legal \nwork authorization, we also provide some relief to those occupations \nthat have traditionally relied on H-2B visas for foreign workers. As we \nall know, H-2B visas are in short supply and high demand.\n  This legislation is important, and I urge the support of my \ncolleagues.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I first wish to express appreciation to the \nSenator from Georgia for explaining very well both the need for and the \ndescription of the legislation on which we will be voting tomorrow, \nwhich is our version of the legislation that will help employers in our \nagricultural sector by including immigration reform which will make it \neasier for them to obtain workers from both the illegal immigrants who \nare in the country today as well as those legal immigrants who would be \napplying under our legislation.\n  Let me go back to kind of a 30,000-foot elevation view here and \ndescribe the reasons we put this legislation together and are offering \nit at this time. As we have said before, the supplemental \nappropriations bill, which will be debated again tomorrow as well as \nlater today and which will help pay for our war efforts in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, is not the appropriate place to be debating immigration. \nUnfortunately, some of our colleagues saw fit to bring amendments to \nthe Senate floor which related to that subject. One of those amendments \nis this amendment that deals with agricultural labor. It was at that \npoint that Senator Chambliss and\n\n[[Page S3769]]\n\nI had no alternative but to present the alternative view of how to \nserve those agricultural needs.\n  The basic difference between the bill Senator Chambliss just \ndescribed and the other bill, the bill that is primarily offered by \nSenators Kennedy and Craig, is the difference between a bill that \nprovides amnesty, in the case of their legislation, for illegal \nimmigrants here, and our bill, which provides the workforce within the \nlegal construct of the law but does not grant amnesty to the illegal \nimmigrants who are here. There are a lot of other differences, but that \nis the prime difference.\n  Both of us recognize that there is a significant need for a workforce \nin this country, willing and able to work in agriculture and related \noccupations, and that cannot be satisfied solely with people who are \nAmerican citizens today.\n  The difference is in the way we treat those people who are here \nillegally today. What the Craig and Kennedy legislation does is to \ngrant those people, very early on, a legal status which permits them to \nbecome legal permanent residents. ``Legal permanent residents'' is a \nterm of art under our immigration law. Some people refer to it as a \ngreen card. As little as 100 hours' work for 3\\1/2\\ months entitles \nsomeone under their legislation to get a green card. A green card is \nlike gold because it enables you to live for the rest of your life in \nthe United States of America and work here.\n  But it also means something else. If you have a green card, you can \nalso apply to become a citizen of the United States of America. It is a \nwonderful thing for people from other countries to get to be citizens \nof the United States of America. We are very much in support of \nimmigration to this country. As my grandparents came here and as almost \nall the rest of us have relatives who came to this country from another \ncountry, we all support legal immigration. But we do not believe that \ngreat opportunity to become a citizen of the United States should be \ngranted to someone on the basis of their illegality; because they came \nhere illegally, because they used counterfeit documents, because they \ngot a job illegally--that on the basis of those factors they should get \nan advantage over those who are abiding by the law and who want to \nbecome U.S. citizens. It is that with which we disagree.\n  What we say is if a person who is in the country illegally today \nwants to work in U.S. agriculture or related industries, and the \nemployer needs that person--and there are certainly a lot of them in \nthat category--the employer petitions and that individual can get a \ndifferent kind of status, a blue card, as Senator Chambliss said. That \nblue card status enables them to work here, to live here, to travel \nback and forth to their country of origin. They can go back and forth \nevery weekend, if they desire. There are no restrictions there. They \nare in the Social Security system. They are protected by our laws. They \nhave to be paid a specific kind of wage, and they have all of the other \nkinds of protections one would think of in this context, but their \nstatus is different from that of a legal permanent resident, a green \ncard holder.\n  Not only are they not entitled to live here the rest of their lives--\neventually they are going to have to return home--but if they want to \nbecome citizens they have to go home and apply for it just like anybody \nelse. What does that mean? They have to be petitioned for by somebody, \nby an employer in this country. It takes about a year for them to \nacquire this status of legal permanent resident. That is how long it \ntakes to get it. But once you get it, you can apply to become a U.S. \ncitizen.\n  We are not punishing people for having violated our laws. Some would \nsay you should not give them the opportunity to become citizens because \nthey broke our laws. As Senator Chambliss pointed out, we are not \nsaying that. If they want to become legal permanent residents and apply \nfor U.S. citizenship, they would have that right. All we ask is that \nthey be treated just like anybody else who wants that right, which is \nto say they apply from their own country, not from the United States; \nthat they wait the same period of time you would have to wait \notherwise, a year; and then, if it is granted, they can apply for \ncitizenship, and all the rest of it works just the same as it would for \nanybody legal.\n\n  What we say is that you cannot use the fact that you came to the \nUnited States illegally to get to stay here and stay here during the \nentire process that you are applying for legal permanent residency and \nU.S. citizenship. That gives you a big advantage, a leg up over those \nwho are abiding by the law and who did not violate the law and come \nhere illegally in the first place. There are other differences, but \nthat is the most critical difference.\n  From our colleagues' standpoint, what we are saying is you can vote \nfor a bill which grants a very simple, convenient, economical way for \nus to get the agricultural labor we need in this country, with all the \nprotections for the laborers which one would expect, without having to \ngrant amnesty to these individuals, and that is a big deal.\n  The second way the Kennedy-Craig legislation provides for amnesty is \nthat it even provides for someone who came to this country illegally \nand is employed illegally here and who then went back to their home \ncountry to come back into the United States and get those same \nadvantages as those who would otherwise have to wait a year for legal \npermanent residency and then later for citizenship. So it not only \nwould apply to those who are here illegally today but those who claimed \nthey worked in the United States illegally in the past. And who knows \nwhat kind of claims we are going to get there? Because, of course, the \ncounterfeit documents, Social Security cards, driver's licenses, and \nother kinds of documents used to gain employment in the first instance \ncan also be used to demonstrate the previous status of having illegally \nworked in the United States of America.\n  (Mr. CHAMBLISS assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. KYL. One of the reasons I believe our bill has more support is \nthat it is more likely to become law, whether it is a stand-alone \nprovision that relates only to agricultural workers or is part of a \nbroader kind of immigration reform. I do not think many people believe \nthe House of Representatives is going to pass a bill with amnesty, so \nwe are trying to be practical about it. We would like to get something \ndone, not simply run an ideological position up the flag pole in order \nto get a vote on it here in the Senate. That is why the American Farm \nBureau is so strongly in support of our legislation and in opposition \nto our colleagues' legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from \nthe American Farm Bureau Federation dated April 13 to the Presiding \nOfficer and myself.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              American Farm Bureau Federation,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 13, 2005.\n     Hon. Saxby Chambliss,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Jon L. Kyl,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Chambliss and Kyl: The American Farm Bureau \n     Federation strongly supports the Chambliss-Kyl Amendment and \n     urges its adoption when it is considered on the Senate floor.\n       This amendment would provide U.S. agriculture a clear, \n     simple, timely and efficient H-2a program to fill seasonal \n     and temporary jobs for which there is a limited U.S. labor \n     supply. In order to recruit a worker from abroad, an employer \n     would first have to make every reasonable effort to find an \n     American worker. This is exactly the kind of meaningful \n     reform that is necessary to provide all sectors of \n     agriculture with a workable program while protecting American \n     workers.\n       The measure also deals sensibly and fairly with illegal \n     immigrants who are now working in agriculture, who meet \n     strict criteria and who pose no security threat. Employers \n     would petition to have such workers granted ``blue card'' \n     temporary worker status. Once granted, a blue card would be \n     valid for three years and could be renewed a maximum of two \n     times (exceptions may be considered for supervisory \n     employees.)\n       This amendment does not grant amnesty to illegal aliens. \n     Blue card workers would have the right to change jobs, earn a \n     fair wage and enjoy the same working conditions the law \n     requires for American workers. Blue card workers would be \n     protected by all labor laws. Blue card workers could travel \n     freely and legally back and forth to their home country.\n       The Chambliss-Kyl proposal strikes a reasonable balance \n     among employers, hard-working employees who are striving to \n     better themselves and the need and obligation\n\n[[Page S3770]]\n\n     of our country to control the flow of immigrants.\n       AFBF supports the Chambliss-Kyl amendment and we urge your \n     fellow Senators to vote for this proposal when it is \n     considered in the Senate.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bob Stallman,\n                                                        President.\n  Mr. KYL. Let me read the opening to give a flavor of what the \nAmerican Farm Bureau Federation is saying:\n\n       The American Farm Bureau Federation strongly supports the \n     Chambliss-Kyl amendment and urges its adoption when it is \n     considered on the Senate floor. This amendment would provide \n     U.S. agriculture a clear, simple, timely and efficient H-2a \n     program to fill seasonal and temporary jobs for which there \n     is a limited U.S. labor supply. . . .\n       This measure also deals sensibly and fairly with illegal \n     immigrants who are now working in agriculture, who meet \n     strict criteria and pose no security threat.\n       This amendment does not grant amnesty to illegal aliens. . \n     . .\n       The Chambliss-Kyl proposal strikes a reasonable balance \n     among employers, hard-working employees who are striving to \n     better themselves and the need and obligation of our country \n     to control the flow of immigrants.\n       The American Farm Bureau Federation supports the Chambliss-\n     Kyl amendment and we urge your fellow Senators to vote for \n     this proposal when it is considered in the Senate.\n\n  In summary, we are going to have two proposals before us, one offered \nby the Senators from Massachusetts and Idaho. We urge you reject that \nproposal because it is not something that is ever going to become law. \nIt provides amnesty for illegal immigrants here. The other is our \nproposal, which enables us to have a good, workable system for \nagricultural labor. It can pass both bodies, and it does not include \namnesty.\n  I note when we begin debate on the supplemental appropriations we \nwill have more of an explanation of what we have offered to our \ncolleagues, but at least this way we have opened up the subject.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have had the pleasure of \nworking with the Senator from Arizona in the finest tradition of the \nSenate, in bipartisanship. We are working together on an issue that is \nof great concern to the country, and that is the estate tax and whether \nit should be eliminated; if not totally eliminated, we are working on \nthe prospect of having a significant exemption and doing something \nabout the balance of a taxable estate as to what would be the actual \nrate at which the remainder of the estate would be taxed.\n  I raise this issue, although this is not the subject of my statement \nto the Senate, because I am following the distinguished junior Senator \nfrom Arizona. It has been my privilege to work with him in trying to \nachieve a bipartisan consensus. What I wish to talk about is achieving \nconsensus in a town that is increasingly polarized by excessive \npartisanship and excessive ideological rigidity. This is a town in \nwhich it has gotten to the point, as told by Lesley Stahl, the CBS \nreporter, the other night, of an experience she had at a dinner party \nwith nonelected officials--just normal folks at a dinner party in New \nYork. The discussion turned to matters having to do with the subjects \nwe are dealing with here in the Congress, and all of a sudden the mood \nin that salubrious dinner party turned hostile. People were starting to \nshout at each other, and any sense of civility was suddenly gone.\n  I worry about that here in the most collegial of all parliamentary \nbodies in the world--this one, right here, the Senate. It has been such \na great privilege for me to be a part of it. Yet, as I see, as the \ndebate is approaching, everything is so partisan and everything starts \nto take on the tinge of ``it's either my way or the highway.'' That is \nnot only not how this Nation has been governed under the Constitution \nfor 217 years, that is, indeed, the very birthright we have had in this \nNation--compromise, compromise, and bringing together consensus in \norder to have a governing ability to function. That was how we came out \nwith the Constitution that we did in that hot summer session of the \nConstitutional Convention in Philadelphia back in 1787. Yet I wonder if \nwe are losing some of that glue that brings us together and has us \nstart drawing up consensus by reaching out to the other Senators and \nmolding our ideas together in order to govern a very large country, a \nbroad country, a diverse country, a complicated country.\n  You can't do it with just one opinion.\n  I have heard some of the statements when I have been interviewed on \nprograms such as CNN and FOX. There were other Senators on these \nprograms with me. I shake my head, wondering how someone could say \nthose things.\n  It is this question this Senate is going to face, whether the rules \nof this body are going to be changed in order to cut off the ability of \na Senator to stand up and speak for as long as he or she wants on a \nsubject of importance to that Senator, and whether that ability, known \nas a filibuster, is going to be taken away from us.\n  What is the history of the filibuster? If you think about how the \nfilibuster works in the Senate, 217 years ago there was no limitation \non a Senator being able to stand up and speak. For over a century, the \nrules provided a Senator could not be cut off. Early in the last \ncentury, that was changed so that if 67 Senators voted to cut off \ndebate, then the debate would be closed. That was a supermajority.\n  Later on--sometime, I believe, in the 1960s--that threshold of 67 was \nlessened to 60. That is the rule we operate under now. A Senator can \nstand up and talk and talk and talk. The ability to speak in this body \nis such that the filibuster helps to encourage compromise. It is saying \nto the majority that because they have an idea, they can't force that \nidea unless they get 60 votes, and that causes the majority to have to \nlisten to the minority. It brings about encouragement of compromise.\n  I don't think we ought to do away with the filibuster. Yet that is \nwhat the Senate is about to do, if the rules are amended.\n  Interestingly, the rules of the Senate say it takes 67 Senators to \namend the rules. But we all have been told of a plan whereby the \nPresiding Officer, the Vice President of the United States--and the \nmajority leader would make a motion and the Chair, the Vice President, \nthe President of the Senate, would rule, and a 51-vote majority would \nchange the rules of the Senate. It is my understanding that the \nParliamentarian of the Senate has in fact stated you can't change the \nrules that way. Yet it looks as though the majority leader, encouraged \nby the majority, is going to try to change the rules--not according to \nthe Senate rules. In other words, it seems the majority is breaking the \nrules in order to change the Senate rules.\n  I don't think that is right. I don't think we ought to be changing \nthe rules in the middle of the game. I don't think it is right to \noverrule the Parliamentarian of the Senate, who is not a partisan \nofficial.\n  I think this starts to verge on the edges of riskiness, if we start \noperating this Senate under those kind of rules, rules that are \nbreaking the rules in order to change the rules.\n  Another way you could put it is that we talk about the majority is \nthreatening to break the rules to win every time. Is that what the \nSenate is all about? Isn't the Senate about the majority having to \nconsult the minority, because under the rules of the Senate, minority \nrights are protected so the majority cannot completely run over the \nminority? Isn't that what is the history and precedent of 217 years in \nthe Senate? I think the history of this body would show that is the \ncase, especially if we get to the point that this body is going to \noverrule the Parliamentarian. I think that is verging on an abuse of \npower of the majority.\n  Remember also a truth--that today's majority will be tomorrow's \nminority, and the minority should always be protected.\n  There is another reason; that is, this group of political geniuses \nwho happened to gather in Philadelphia back in that hot summer of 1787 \ncreated a system that had indeed separation of powers--that no one \ninstitution or one person in the Government of the United States could \nbecome so all powerful as to mow over other persons in the institution.\n  In that separation of powers of the executive from the legislative \nand from the judicial, they also created checks and balances inherent \nin the Constitution so that power cannot accumulate\n\n[[Page S3771]]\n\nin any one person's hands. Thus, in the Congress they created a House \nof Representatives which represents the population, and a Senate, which \nwas the Great Compromise in the Constitutional Convention of 1787--the \nSenate that represented each State equally with two Senators. In the \nrules that evolved from that body, the checks and balances arose to \nprotect the minority.\n  Let us look in the separation of powers, the executive, the \nlegislative, and the judicial. What was created, and created over time, \nwas the value of an independent judiciary, a judiciary that was going \nto be appointed in a two-step process. A one-step process that the \nConstitutional Convention rejected was that the appointment be only by \nthe President. The Constitutional Convention created a two-step process \nin which the President nominates and the Senate confirms or rejects. \nThat is part of the checks and balances.\n  I must say, as a senior Senator from Florida, I have been absolutely \nbewildered at statements I have heard on the floor of the Senate as \nwell as I have heard from some of my colleagues when we have been \ninterviewed on these news programs in which it is claimed we are \nrejecting all of these judges. Let me tell you what this Senator from \nFlorida has done. Of the 215 nominations before the Senate, this \nSenator has voted for 206 of them. That means there are only 9 this \nSenator has not voted for. In other words, under the administration of \nPresident George W. Bush, I have voted for 206 of his 215 nominations. \nThat is 96 percent I voted for.\n\n  Does that sound as though this Senator is not approving all of the \nconservative judges? Every one of those judges who have come forth to \nus was a conservative judge. I have voted for 96 percent of them. I can \ntell you that the 9 I have not voted for--by the way, I voted for one a \nmajority of my party voted against, and that was Miguel Estrada. But I \nhad reasons, because I called him in and asked him if he would obey the \nlaw as a court of appeals judge. He said he would. I said that is good \nenough for me. But the remaining nine, I have plenty of reasons why I \ndo not think they are entitled to a lifetime appointment as a Federal \njudge.\n  That is my prerogative as a Senator, and it is also my prerogative as \na Senator under the rules of the Senate to stand up and to speak as \nlong as this Senator has breath in order to get that opinion across.\n  I have been amazed to hear some of my colleagues say here on the \nSenate floor as well as in some of these television interviews that we \nhave done--and sometimes done together--that utilizing the filibuster \nhas never been used, they say, against a judge nominee. My goodness, \nall you have to do is look at history. In 1881, Stanley Matthews was \nnominated by President Hayes to be a Justice of the Supreme Court, and \nhe was filibustered. In 1968, Abe Fortas was nominated by President \nJohnson to be Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court, and he \nwas filibustered.\n  Since the start of the George W. Bush administration in 2001, 11 \njudicial nominations have needed 60 votes for cloture in order to end a \nfilibuster. That is before President Bush's term which started in 2001.\n  How people can come with a straight face and say a filibuster has not \nbeen used on judicial appointments, I simply don't understand. It \ndefies the historical record of the Senate.\n  I think there are several principles that are very important as we \nconsider this. It is my hope--and I have reached out to colleagues, \ndear personal friends who are friends regardless of party--that we can \navoid this constitutional clash which should not be and changing the \nrules by breaking the rules.\n  Remember, a filibuster is to help encourage compromise. We shouldn't \nbe changing the rules in the middle of the game. The underlying \nprinciple I want our Senators to remember as we get into this debate--\nhopefully it will be headed off by cooler minds. As the Good Book says, \ncome now and let us reason together. Remember these principles.\n  The Constitution stands for an independent judiciary. There are very \nnecessary checks and balances in our form of government to keep the \naccumulation of power from any one agency, or executive branch, or \nperson's hands.\n  We should not be overruling the Parliamentarian. We must encourage \ncompromise. To change the rules in the middle of the game is bordering \non an abuse of power. Surely the Senate can rise above this partisan, \nhighly ideological set of politics and come together for the sake of \nthe Nation.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I will speak in morning business to the point \ndiscussed by my colleague from Florida. I understand another Senator \nwas going to be here; when he arrives, I will yield the floor.\n  It is important for my colleagues and for the American people to \nappreciate a little bit of the background of this issue with respect to \njudges. My colleague from Florida makes a point that he has voted for \nmost of the President's judicial nominees. Indeed, that has been the \ncase with every Senator for every President.\n  But until the last 2 years, we have voted both for district court \nnominees and circuit court nominees. Two years ago, the Democratic \nminority began filibustering circuit court nominees. That is why \nPresident Bush has had a lower percentage of his nominees approved than \nany President since Franklin Roosevelt for the important circuit court \npositions. In fact, a third of President Bush's circuit court nominees \nwere filibustered or could not be brought to a vote because they would \nhave been filibustered; fully 17 out of around 35.\n  So when our colleagues on the other side of the aisle talk about the \nlarge number of judges they have approved, they are folding in all of \nthe Federal district court nominees everyone has always voted for. That \nis not the appropriate measure. The question is, how many circuit court \nnominees? Never before, in the history of our country, have we seen \ncircuit court nominees or district court nominees, for that matter, but \ncircuit court nominees filibustered in this manner--ten separate judges \nwe could not come to a final up-or-down vote, seven more who would have \nhad the same fate had they been voted for. That has never happened \nbefore in the history of the country.\n  Our colleague from Illinois was discussing the fact that a former \nSenator from New Hampshire had, in this Senate, talked about \nfilibuster, following a couple of judges for the Ninth Circuit Court of \nAppeals. In fact, that Senator had said that. The interesting point is, \neven though he, a single Senator, wanted to filibuster the nominees--\ntheir names were Berzon and Paez--the Republican leader, Trent Lott \nfrom Mississippi, made an arrangement with the then-Democratic leader, \nDaschle from South Dakota, that they would not be filibustered, and we \nfiled cloture, which is the petition to bring the matter to a close so \nwe could take a final vote. Senators on both sides of the aisle \nsupported the cloture motion, so they supported getting to a final vote \non those two judges. Of course, cloture was invoked, meaning they were \nnot filibustered.\n  They were brought up for a vote. Some voted against them--I voted for \nBerzon and against Paez--but the net result is they are both sitting on \nthe Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals today. They were not filibustered. \nSo there is no case of a filibuster of the circuit court judge. None.\n  Second, the only other situation in which it is alleged a filibuster \noccurred was with Abe Fortas, whose name was withdrawn by Lyndon \nJohnson the day after a cloture vote failed to succeed. As Senator \nGriffin from Michigan, who was then leading that opposition to Abe \nFortas, has told me and others, there was no effort to filibuster \nbecause they had the votes to kill the judge. They simply had not had \ntime to debate him, which is why they voted against the cloture, but as \na result of the President acknowledging he had no support in the \nSenate, his name was withdrawn.\n  There has never been a filibuster of a Supreme Court or circuit court \njudge in the United States--it simply is erroneous to suggest there has \nbeen--nor is it correct to say we have been voting on all of these \ndifferent judges. If you take the district court judges out, about whom \nthere is no controversy, there is a huge issue because fully a third of \nthe President's circuit court\n\n[[Page S3772]]\n\nnominees were not voted on because of this new filibuster by the \nDemocratic minority.\n  We need to have some perspective. Who is changing the rules? Until 2 \nyears ago, all the judges got up-or-down votes. Judges that could not \neven get out of the Judiciary Committee with a majority vote were \ngranted the privilege or courtesy of a vote in the Senate. During the \ndebate when Clarence Thomas was being confirmed, several leading \nDemocratic Senators came to the Senate to oppose Judge Thomas. They \nsaid they actually had thought about trying to filibuster his \nnomination but that would be wrong because filibustering judicial \nnominees is wrong. Senator Leahy, Senator Kennedy, and others came to \nthis floor and said, we do not know whether we will defeat Clarence \nThomas or not, but we are not going to defeat him with a filibuster \nbecause that would be wrong.\n  Sure enough, they were correct. They lost the vote, 48-52. He was \nconfirmed. I admired them because they stood for principle. The rule \nand the tradition of this body had always been we give the nominees an \nup-or-down vote, but if they could get 51 votes for confirmation, they \nbecame a circuit court judge or a Supreme Court justice. That is what \nhappened in the case of Clarence Thomas.\n\n  Now, all of a sudden, it has been turned around, and the Democratic \nminority, almost to a person, has said they believe judges should be \nfilibustered, and the President's nominees are not going to get an up-\nor-down vote if they decide they want to filibuster a particular \nnominee.\n  As I said, at least a third of these circuit court nominees so far \nhave been filibustered. It is our understanding that practice will \ncontinue unless we can get back to the way it has always been, the \ntraditional role of the Senate in providing advice and consent with a \nmajority vote, up or down.\n  It has also been suggested the President is nominating a new, wild \nvariety of lawyers and judges to be circuit court judges, way out of \nthe mainstream kind of people. This, of course, is absolutely \nludicrous. The kind of people that President Bush has nominated are \nrespected jurists or lawyers.\n  The American Bar Association, which used to be the Democrat's gold \nstandard for approving the judicial nominees, has judged all of these \ncandidates qualified. Yet somehow some of our colleagues on the left \nsay they are out of the mainstream. My colleague on the Judiciary \nCommittee, the Senator from New York, for example, has made this charge \non several occasions.\n  I ask, who is probably more representative of the mainstream? A \nsingle Senator from a State, for example, like New York? Or the \nPresident of the United States who had to get elected with support from \nall over this country? I don't think anyone would say George Bush is \nout of the mainstream, that President Bush is out of the mainstream of \nthis country.\n  Who are some of the people he has nominated? Some are judges who have \nhad to stand for election, for example, in California and Texas, and \nhave received supermajorities, 70 or 80 percent. I have forgotten the \nexact numbers of support from the citizens of their States. One is a \nblue State. One is a red State. When well over 50 or 60 percent of the \ncitizens in this State vote to support these judges to continue in \noffice on their State supreme court, you would hardly say these \nnominees are out of the mainstream. Yet those two particular judges, \nJanice Rogers Brown from California and Percilla Owen from Texas, are \nthe ones for whom this filibuster has been applied.\n  It does not make sense to suggest a tradition of this Senate to give \npeople an up-or-down vote is going to be overturned because all of a \nsudden a President is proposing people who are wildly out of the \nmainstream.\n  What has the Republican majority at least considered doing? Simply \nreturning to the way it has always been, to going back to the 200 \nyears--before 2 years ago--and giving people an up-or-down vote. \nMembers can still vote against the nominee. Members do not have to vote \nfor the nominee, but at least give them an up-or-down vote. We do that \nbased upon the precedence that has been set by the then-majority leader \nof this Senate, the Senator from West Virginia, who, on not fewer than \nfour separate occasions, utilized the precedence of this body to ensure \nthat dilatory tactics could not prevail in this Senate and that we \ncould move forward with the business of the Senate.\n  It is the very same precedent that would be used to reestablish the \nup-or-down vote which has been the tradition of this Senate all along. \nThat is not rubberstamping. That is giving due consideration to these \nnominees and giving them an up-or-down vote at the end of the day.\n  When Americans look at this sort of intramural battle occurring in \nthe Senate, they have to wonder why this is happening, why it is so \nimportant. I suspect it may have something to do with the fact there \nmight be a vacancy on the Supreme Court, and our friends on the other \nside of the aisle are so afraid President Bush might nominate someone \nwho could gain majority support they are prepared to actually refuse \nthat nominee an up-or-down vote. That would be unprecedented in the \nhistory of this body. I don't think it is right.\n  Some people have called this the nuclear option because they \nthreatened to blow the Senate up if we try to return to the traditional \nrule of an up-or-down vote in the Senate. That is a very unfortunate \nname and a very unfortunate threat. No one should be threatening to go \nnuclear or blow the place up or prevent the Senate from doing its \nbusiness. Our constituents sent us here for a reason, to get work done, \nto pass a budget, to pass the appropriations bill, to pass the bill \nthat is before the Senate right now, the supplemental appropriations \nbill that will literally fund our troops' effort in Afghanistan and \nIraq, to pass an energy bill, to pass a defense authorization bill, all \nof the other important things they want us to do here.\n  Yet we have some colleagues suggesting, if they do not get their way \non these judges, like a school-yard bully who has a call go against him \nby the referee and picks up his ball and goes home so the rest of the \nkids cannot play. Is that the threat here; pick up your ball and go \nhome so the rest of us cannot do the business we were sent here to do?\n\n  Let me make one final prediction. Last time we met as members of the \nJudiciary Committee, we could not get a quorum to do business. Not one \nmember of the minority party showed up. We have to have at least one \nfor a quorum. This was not the last meeting but the penultimate \nmeeting. They said there were three members going to the funeral of the \nPope; 3 out of 9. I predict, at another meeting on Thursday--and we \nneed to pass the judges out to consider them on the floor--they will \nnot give a quorum then, they will not show up or, if they do show up, \nthey filibuster it so we cannot get the judges adopted. I predict right \nnow the judges that are on the agenda for that meeting this coming week \nwill not be passed out. They might pass out one or two, but they are \nnot going to allow us to pass all of those judges so they can be \nconsidered by the full Senate.\n  It was Members of the minority party who complained, while \nRepublicans never filibustered, they did keep some of President \nClinton's judicial nominees bottled up in committee. We will see \nwhether they are willing to pass these nominees--I think there are 6 or \n7 pending--we will see whether or not they are willing to show up for \nthe meeting so there is a quorum and enabling the committee to pass \nthem out to the full body so we can debate the nominees or whether they \ntalk and talk and talk until the meeting has to end, no one else is \naround, and we no longer have a quorum or they simply do not show up \nfor a quorum.\n  We will see what they do. I predict right now my colleagues are not \ngoing to allow us to get those judges to the Senate so we can begin the \ndebate and the consideration of whether they should be confirmed. That \nwill be a real shame and, again, a violation of what this Senate has \nalways done in the past, even when we did not particularly think a \nnominee should receive an affirmative vote on the floor. I believe \nClarence Thomas was in this situation. The committee passed him to the \nSenate to see what the full body would do to give its advice and \nconsent which is what the Constitution calls upon us to do.\n  I close by urging my colleagues not to confuse this discussion with \nerroneous information or talk about things\n\n[[Page S3773]]\n\nthat are in a history that never was but, rather, to approach it on the \nbasis of moving forward, in a bipartisan way, to fill our \nconstitutional responsibilities to grant these judges an up-or-down \nvote by our advice and consent so we can put people on the court in \nthese very important positions to serve the American people.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Mr. President, I am going to speak on another matter. We \nhave learned that those who are intent on forcing confrontation, \nbreaking the Senate rules, and undercutting our democratic checks and \nbalances plan to take their previous outrageous allegations of \nreligious McCarthyism one step further and accuse Democrats of being \n``against people of faith'' because we object to seven--seven--of the \nPresident's more than 200 judicial nominations.\n  If you followed the sick logic of this venom being spewed by some of \nthe leaders in this Chamber, we would have to say that 205 judicial \nnominees forwarded by the President, whom the Democratic Senators have \nhelped to confirm, would seem not to be people of faith, even though \nthat is as false and ridiculous on its face as is the charge leveled at \nDemocratic Senators.\n  This disgusting spectacle, this smear of good men and women as \n``against faith'' is expected to happen, in of all places, a house of \nworship, according to a front-page article last week in the New York \nTimes. It will involve twisting history, as well as religion, because \naccording to the report, those involved will claim that Democratic \nSenators are using the filibuster rule to keep people of faith off of \nthe Federal bench.\n  This slander is so laden with falsehoods, so permeated by the smoke \nand mirrors of partisan politics, and so intertwined with one man's \npersonal political aspirations that it should collapse of its own \nweight. But too many who should speak out against it remain violent.\n  Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee began blatantly to \ninvoke obscene accusations like this one earlier in the Bush \nadministration. They hurled false charges against Senators saying they \nwere anti-Hispanic or anti-African American, anti-woman, anti-religion, \nanti-Catholic, and anti-Christian for opposing certain judicial \nnominees.\n  They never bothered to mention the same Senators who were making \nthese slanderous statements had blocked, themselves, many, many, many--\nover 60--Hispanics, women, certainly people of faith. And they never \nbothered to say the Senators they were slandering had supported \nhundreds of nominees, including Hispanics, African Americans, women, \nand people of faith--Catholic, Christian, and Jewish. They never \nhesitated to stoke the flames of bigotry, and to encourage their \nsupporters to continue the smear in cyberspace or on the pages of \nnewspapers or through direct mail.\n\n  Actually, to the contrary, they seemed to like the way it sounded. \nMaybe it tested well in their political polls. Now they have decided to \nup the ante on such ``religious McCarthyism,'' as a way to help them \ntear down the Senate and do away with the last bastion against this \nPresident's most extreme judicial nominees. It is crass demagoguery, \nand it is fueled by the arrogance of power.\n  They now seek to make a connection between the dark days of the \nstruggle for civil rights, when some used the filibuster to try to \ndefeat equal rights laws, and the situation we find ourselves in today \nwhen the voice of the minority struggles to be heard above the \ncacophony of daily lies and misrepresentations. This tactical shift \nfollows on the rhetorical attacks aimed at the judiciary over the past \nfew weeks in which Federal judges were likened to the KKK and ``the \nfocus of evil.''\n  In the last few weeks, we have heard that, at an event attended by \nRepublican Members of the Congress, people called for Stalinist \nsolutions to problems, referring to Joseph Stalin's reference to \nkilling people he disagreed with, and calling for mass impeachments. \nWouldn't you think the Members of Congress, who have taken an oath to \nuphold the Constitution, would speak up or at least leave with their \nheads bowed in shame, instead of, apparently, enjoying it?\n  Last week, the Senate Democratic leadership called upon the President \nand the Republican leadership of Congress to denounce these \ninflammatory statements against judges. This week, I renew my call to \nthe Republican leader and, in particular, to Republican moderates, to \ndenounce the religious McCarthyism that is again pervading their side \nof this debate.\n  I ask my friends on the other side of the aisle to follow the brave \nexample of one of Vermont's greatest Senators, Republican Ralph \nFlanders. Senator Flanders recognized a ruthless political opportunist \nwhen he saw one. He knew Senator Joseph McCarthy had exploited his \nposition of power in the Senate to smear hundreds of innocent people \nand win headlines and followers, and campaign contributions, with his \nfalse charges and innuendo, without regard to facts or rules or human \ndecency.\n  Senator Flanders spoke out during this dark chapter in the history of \nthis great institution. He offered a resolution of censure condemning \nthe conduct of Senator McCarthy. Now, in our time, a line has again \nbeen crossed by some seeking to influence this body. I ask my friends \non the other side of the aisle to follow Senator Flanders' lead in \ncondemning the crossing of that line.\n  I have served with many fair-minded Republican Senators. I am \nsaddened to see Republican Senators stay silent when they are invited \nto disavow these abuses. Where are the voices of reason? Will the \nRepublicans not heed the clarion call that Republican Senator John \nDanforth sounded a few weeks ago? And he is an ordained Episcopal \npriest. What has silenced these Senators who otherwise have taken \nmoderate and independent stands in the past? Why are they allowing this \nreligious McCarthyism to take place unchallenged? The demagoguery that \nis so cynically and corrosively being used by supporters of the \nPresident's most extreme judicial nominees needs to stop.\n  Not only must this bogus religious test end, but Senators should \ndenounce the launching of the nuclear option, the Republicans' \nprecedent-shattering proposal to destroy the Senate in one stroke, \nwhile shifting the checks and balances of the Senate to the White \nHouse.\n  I would like to keep the Senate safe and secure and in a ``nuclear \nfree'' zone. Even our current Parliamentarian's office and our \nCongressional Research Service has said the so-called nuclear option \nwould go against Senate\n\n[[Page S3774]]\n\nprecedent and require the Chair to overrule the Parliamentarian. Is \nthis how we want to govern the Senate? Do Republicans want to blatantly \nbreak the rules for some kind of a short-term political gain?\n  Just as the Constitution provides in Article V for a method of \namendment, so, too, the Senate Rules provide for their own amendment. \nSadly, the current crop of zealot partisans who are seeking to limit \ndebate and minority rights in the Senate have no respect for the \nSenate, its role in our government as a check on the executive or its \nRules. Republicans are in the majority in the Senate and chair all of \nits Committees, including the Rules Committee. If Republicans have a \nserious proposal to change the Senate Rules, they should introduce it. \nThe Rules Committee should hold serious hearings on it and consider it \nand create a full and fair record so that the Senate itself would be in \nposition to consider it. That is what we used to call ``regular \norder.'' That is how the Senate is intended to operate, through \ndeliberative processes and with all points of view being protected and \nbeing able to be heard.\n  That is not how the ``nuclear option'' will work. It is intended to \nwork outside established precedents and procedures as explained by the \nCongressional Research Service report from last month. Use of the \n``nuclear option'' in the Senate is akin to amending the Constitution \nnot by following the procedures required by Article V but by \nproclaiming that 51 Republican Senators have determined that every copy \nof the Constitution shall contain a new section or different words--or \nnot contain some of those troublesome amendments that Americans like to \ncall the Bill of Rights. That is wrong. It is a kind of lawlessness \nthat each of us should oppose. It is rule by the parliamentary \nequivalent of brute force.\n\n  The recently constituted Iraqi National Assembly was elected in \nJanuary. In April it acted pursuant to its governing law to select a \npresidency council by the required vote of two-thirds of the Assembly, \na supermajority. That same governing law says that it can only be \namended by a three-quarters vote of the National Assembly. Use of the \n``nuclear option'' in the Senate is akin to Iraqis in the majority \npolitical party of the Assembly saying that they have decided to change \nthe law to allow them to pick only members of their party for the \ngovernment and to do so by a simple majority vote. They might feel \njustified in acting contrary to law because the Kurds and the Sunni \nwere driving a hard bargain and because governing through consensus is \nnot as easy as ruling unilaterally. It is not supposed to be, that is \nwhy our system of government is the world's example.\n  If Iraqi Shiites, Sunni and Kurds can cooperate in their new \ngovernment to make democratic decisions, so can Republicans and \nDemocrats in the United States Senate. If the Iraqi law and Assembly \ncan protect minority rights and participation, so can the rules and \nUnited States Senate. That has been the defining characteristic of the \nSenate and one of the principal ways in which it was designed to be \ndistinct from the House or Representatives.\n  This week, the Senate is debating an emergency supplemental \nappropriations bill to fund the war efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan. \nThe justification for these billions of dollars being spent each week \nis that we are seeking to establish democracies. How ironic that at the \nsame time we are undertaking these efforts at great cost to so many \nAmerican families, some are seeking to undermine the protection of \nminority rights and checks and balances represented by the Senate \nthrough our own history. Yet that is what I see happening.\n  President Bush emphasized in his discussions earlier this year with \nPresident Putin of Russia that the essentials of a democracy include \nprotecting minority rights and an independent judiciary. The Republican \n``nuclear option'' will undermine our values here at the same time we \nare preaching our values to others abroad.\n  I urge Senate Republicans to listen carefully to what their leaders \nare saying, here in the Senate, and out across the country to their \nmost extreme supporters. Consider what it is they are about to do and \nthe language they use to justify it. Both are wrong. It would steer the \nSenate and the country away from democracy, away from the protections \nof the minority and away from the checks and balances that ensure the \nfreedoms of all Americans.\n  I would also like to talk for a moment about the independence of the \njudiciary. I have expressed my concern that members of Congress have \nsuggested judges be impeached if they disagree with the judges' \ndecisions. Republicans rushed through legislation telling federal \njudges what to do in the Schiavo case, and then criticized the judges \nwhen they acted independently, judges appointed by President Reagan, by \nformer President Bush, and by President Clinton. They were all \ncriticized for that, although there are still those who are saying we \nshould impeach the judges, or as I mentioned earlier in my speech, one \nspeaker at a recent conference, to the cheers of some suggested Joseph \nStalin's famous ``No man. No problem'' solution, because he killed \nthose who disagreed.\n  I remember a group of Russian parliamentarians came to see me to talk \nabout federal judiciary, and they asked, ``Is it true that in the \nUnited States the government might be a party in a lawsuit and that the \ngovernment could lose?'' I said, ``Absolutely right.'' They said, \n``People would dare to sue the government?'' I said, ``We have an \nindependent judiciary, yes, they could.'' They said, ``Well, if the \ngovernment lost, you fire the judges, of course?'' I said, ``No, they \nare an independent judiciary.'' And I remember the discussion around \nthe conference room in my office. This was the most amazing thing to \nthem, that the people who disagreed with the government could actually \ngo to a federal court or a state court, bring a suit there and seek \nredress even if it meant the government lost. Sometimes it wins, \nsometimes it loses. I was a government prosecutor. I know how that \nworks. I think they finally understood that the reason we are such a \ngreat democracy is that we have an independent judiciary.\n  I would call out to my friends on the other side of the aisle to stop \nslamming the federal judiciary. We don't have to agree with every one \nof their opinions but let's respect their independence. Let's not say \nthings that are going to bring about further threats against our \njudges. We've had a lot more judges killed than we've had U.S. Senators \nkilled for carrying out their duties. We ought to be protecting them \nand their integrity. If we disagree with what they've done in a case \nwhere we can pass a law and we feel we should, then pass a law and \nchange it. Don't take the pot shots that put all judges in danger and \nthat attack the very independence of our federal judiciary.\n  We remember our own oath of office. Part of upholding the \nConstitution is upholding the independence of the third branch of \ngovernment. One party or the other will control the presidency. One \nparty or the other will control each House of Congress. No political \nparty should control the judiciary. It should be independent of all \npolitical parties. That was the genius of the founders of this country. \nIt is the genius that has protected our liberties and our rights for \nwell over 200 years. It is the genius of this country that will \ncontinue to protect them if we allow it to. It would be a terrible \ndiminution of our rights and it would be one of the most threatening \nthings to our whole democracy if we were to remove the independence of \nour federal judiciary. That would do things that no armies marched \nagainst us have ever been able to do. None of the turmoil, the wars, \nall that we've gone through in this country has ever been able to do. \nIf you take away the independence of our federal judiciary, then our \nwhole constitutional fabric unravels.\n  I will close with one little story. One day, years ago, on the floor \nof this Senate, there was an attempt, in a court-stripping bill, to \nremove jurisdiction of the Federal courts because one Senator did not \nlike a decision they came down with. It was decided if there had not \nbeen a vote by 4 o'clock on a Friday afternoon, we would not vote on \nit. So three Senators took the floor to talk against it--myself, former \nRepublican Senator, Lowell Weicker of Connecticut, and one other. We \nspoke for several hours, and the bill was drawn down.\n  Now, I do not remember what the decision was of the Federal court.\n\n[[Page S3775]]\n\n  I may have agreed with it. I may have disagreed. I did not want to \nsee us making the Senate into some kind of a supreme court that would \noverturn any decision we didn't like. On the way out, the third Senator \ncame up to Lowell Weicker and myself and linked his arm in ours, and he \nsaid: We are the only true conservatives on this floor because we want \nto protect the Constitution and not make these changes.\n  I turned to him and I said: Senator Goldwater, you are absolutely \nright.\n  I was glad Barry Goldwater, Lowell Weicker, and I stood up for the \nConstitution, stood up for the independence of the Federal judiciary. \nIt probably was unpopular to do so, but I think Senator Goldwater, \nSenator Weicker, and I all agreed it was the right thing to do.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I send a modification to the desk and I \nask unanimous consent that Senator Allen be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n       On page 169, between lines 8 and 9, insert the following:\n\n\n    PROHIBITION ON TERMINATION OF EXISTING JOINT-SERVICE MULTIYEAR \n              PROCUREMENT CONTRACT FOR C/KC-130J AIRCRAFT\n\n       Sec. 1122. During fiscal year 2005, no funds may be \n     obligated or expended to terminate the joint service \n     multiyear procurement contract for C/KC-130J aircraft that is \n     in effect on the date of the enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, this amendment will prohibit any fiscal \nyear 2005 funds from being used to terminate the C-130J multi-year \nprocurement contract.\n  In hearings before this body over the past several weeks Department \nof Defense personnel have admitted that when they made the decision to \nterminate this contract in December of last year that they did not have \nall the information needed to make that decision. Since PBD 753 was \ndrafted in December 2004, we have learned that the cost to terminate \nthis contract is approximately $1.6 billion.\n  Also over the past several months we have seen the C-130J, KC-130J, \nas well as C-130s operated by our coalition partners in Iraq perform \nsuperbly throughout USCENTCOM. To date, C-130Js in Iraq have flown over \n400 missions, with a mission capable rate of 93 percent and have \nperformed all assigned missions successfully. KC-130Js have flown 789 \nhours in Iraq with mission capable rates in excess of 95 percent. \nNevertheless, the Department of Defense has not yet submitted the \namended budget request for this program that they discussed during \nhearings. That is why this amendment is necessary.\n  I am introducing this amendment to make sure that this program, which \nis performing extremely well and which meets validated Air Force and \nMarine Corps requirements, is not prematurely cancelled and that the \nDepartment of Defense follows through with their commitment to complete \nthe multi-year procurement contract.\n  There are some issues with the current contract being a commercial \ncontract versus a traditional military contract. My colleague, Senator \nMcCain, and I agree that a traditional contract is more appropriate in \nthis case and applaud the Air Force's decision to begin\n\n[[Page S3776]]\n\ntransitioning the program in that direction. However, I think we can \nall agree, that regardless of how these planes are procured, that the \nUnited States military needs them and they are demonstrating their \nvalue to the warfighter, and to the taxpayer today.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I think we are now ready to begin a \nconversation. There are several colleagues here, including the Senators \nfrom Georgia, Alabama, and Idaho, we would like to discuss this issue \nwe are going to be voting on tomorrow. Our colleagues need to have a \nclear picture of what we will be voting on.\n  There are two basic versions of legislation to try to make it easier \nfor agricultural employers to hire people who are temporary workers or \nwho have been in the United States illegally and can be employed under \nthe bills proposed here. There are two different approaches. One is the \napproach of the Senator from Idaho--I will defer to him in a moment to \nhave him discuss his approach--and the other approach Senator Chambliss \nand I have offered. There are a couple of key differences. They both \napproach the problem from the standpoint of broadening the way in which \nlegal immigrants can come to the country and be employed legally in \nagriculture and taking illegal immigrants who are currently not working \nwithin the legal regime, using counterfeit or fraudulent documents--\nand, everybody knows, being employed illegally--and enabling them to \nwork for a temporary period of time legally in this country.\n  The primary difference between the approaches is over the question of \namnesty. Regarding that, I think everybody would have to admit--and \ndifferent people have different definitions of what amnesty is--\neverybody would have to agree, if there is a difference in how you can \nbecome a legal, permanent resident in this country or a citizen, you \nwould have to agree, if someone is granted an advantage over an \napplicant for legal permanent residency or citizenship status in \nanother country, if they are given an advantage because they came here \nillegally and counterfeited documents to get employment and worked here \nillegally, to give them an advantage over people who are seeking to \ncome here legally is giving them an advantage that would amount to \namnesty. You should not be able to use, in other words, your illegal \nstatus to bootstrap yourself into a position of legal, permanent \nresidency or citizenship.\n  I pointed out before, under the bill of the Senators from \nMassachusetts and Idaho, there would be an ability for people not in \nthe United States but who would like to come here to claim they worked \nin the country illegally, and that would give them an ability to come \nhere and apply for this same status. So, ironically, we would be \nturning on a neon sign that says come here with documents--they could \nbe fraudulent and you could have defrauded us before--and claim that \nyou worked in the country illegally, and we will let you come back in \nagain.\n  I don't know how you give people an advantage on the basis they \nviolated our law. You would think you would want to give people an \nadvantage who have played by the rules. That is the second way in which \nthis bill grants amnesty and is not the right approach. As my colleague \nfrom Georgia talked about, we would be changing, for the first time, a \nlaw to allow the Legal Services Corporation to represent these illegal \nimmigrants, which is something we have not been willing to do in the \npast. We have to be careful because the reason illegal immigrants are \nworking here is the current H2-A law is so cumbersome to use, it is so \nsubject to abuse and costs money and takes time and you can be sued, \nand so on, that employers don't like to use it. It is just not worth it \nto them. If we are going to have a bill that is no easier to use, there \nis not going to be any advantage over the current law and, as a result, \nit is going to be difficult for farmers to utilize this new provision \nif they have to look over their shoulder and wonder if the Legal \nServices Corporation is going to file a lawsuit.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KYL. Yes.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask the Senator, doesn't the AgJOBS \nbill, as well as the Chambliss-Kyl amendment, recognize there is a need \nin this country for agricultural workers to do the job that is not \nbeing done by American workers today, and we are not displacing \nAmerican workers?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, that is a very good question. I think all of \nus would agree that we cannot be displacing American workers. We are \ncurrently not doing that today. There is a need for these employees, \nand it is really a question of which approach is the better one, to \nensure we can match a willing worker with a willing employer without \ngranting amnesty.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Would the Senator from Arizona yield for another \nquestion?\n  Mr. KYL. Yes.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Does the Chambliss-Kyl amendment not take the current \nH2-A program, which is very cumbersome and requires a lot of paperwork \nand requires the adverse effect wage rate to be paid, and streamline \nthat program to where it is more easily usable by farmers who now \nsimply don't use it because it is cumbersome? Does it alleviate some of \nthe problems?\n\n  Mr. KYL. Yes. We change the wage rate to the prevailing wage. We make \nit easier for the farmer to demonstrate that there are not American \nworkers available to do the jobs. We make it easier, cheaper, faster, \nbut with protections for the employees.\n  I think all of that is why the American Farm Bureau Federation has \nendorsed our legislation as the best way for them to satisfy these \nemployment needs.\n  Mr. President, I will close and allow my colleagues the opportunity \nto speak. Senator Craig wants to disagree with us, and I want to give \nhim that opportunity. Let me allow him to describe his bill, and we can \nhave a debate back and forth as to which bill better satisfies our \nemployment needs or requirements but doing so in a way that we can \nactually get a bill passed and sent to the President; i.e., a bill that \ndoesn't include amnesty.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator from Arizona \nfinally coming to the floor with a piece of legislation. For the last \nseveral years, I have challenged the Senate to deal with what I \nbelieve, and I think most colleagues believe, is a very urgent problem. \nOur borders, as much money as we have poured into them and as many new \nborder patrolmen as we have put along them--primarily our southern \nborder today--are still being overrun substantially by illegal people \ncrossing.\n  While we have been trying, since 9/11, to understand and reform our \nimmigration laws, there has been a great deal of talk, but very little \ndone--some 1,300 days now of high-flying political talk about the \ndramatic problem that we awakened to post-9/11, and that was that there \nwere between 8 million to 12 million undocumented illegal people in our \ncountry--most of them here and working hard to help themselves and \ntheir families. But it was obvious there were a few here with the \nevilest intent in mind: to destroy our country and to destroy us, too.\n  While I accept the argument, as most do, that comprehensive \nimmigration reform is critical, right now we have a critical situation \nin front of us as it relates to agriculture. Starting about 5 years \nago, and before 9/11, American agriculture was attempting to get the \nCongress to look at their plight. The plight was obvious and simple--\nand criticize it if you will--but the reality was that 50 to 70 percent \nof their workforce was undocumented, and the law we had given them, as \nthe Senator from Arizona has so clearly spoken to, was so cumbersome, \ncostly, and so untimely--and the key to timeliness is when the crop is \nin the field and ripe, it has to come out or it rots--that American \nagriculture could not depend on it. The workforce who was seeking the \nwork in American agriculture began to recognize it. If you will, the \nblack market or the illegal processes began.\n\n[[Page S3777]]\n\n  It should not be a surprise to any of us that when government stands \nin the way of commerce, stands in the way of an economy, usually people \nfind a way around it. Tragically enough, it happened. But, by \ndefinition, it was an illegal way.\n  Last year, in our country, there were 2 months in which we were a net \nimporter of food. This year, it is guesstimated it could be in as many \nas 6 months that we will be a net importer of food, and that will be \nthe first time, in the history of American agriculture, that becomes \nthe situation. So why we are here on the floor today debating a piece \nof a much broader overall immigration problem is because it is urgent, \nit is important we deal with it, and we deal with it now as \nthoughtfully and as thoroughly as we can. That is why I insisted that \nthe Senate come to this issue.\n  I am glad my colleagues have come up with an alternative. I think the \nprovisions in it are quickly thought up. They were criticizing my bill \nearlier because I offered a temporary visa. They offer a visa. They \noffered it for 3 years--3 years--as many as 9 years. What I am glad to \nhear said, for those who argue what we were doing was an amnesty issue, \nis that it is no longer viewed as that, that we recognize there is a \nlegitimate need for an American agricultural workforce, and it is \ncritically necessary we make it a legal workforce for the sake of our \ncountry, for the sake of our borders, and for the sake of American \nagriculture.\n  That is what this debate will be all about in the next several hours \nand tomorrow morning before we vote on this issue. Both sides have \naccepted a rather unusual procedure, Mr. President--a supermajority \nprocedure. Why? Well, we are germane to this supplemental bill because \nof what the House did earlier with a Sensenbrenner amendment dealing \nwith what is known as REAL ID. It dealt with immigration and, as a \nresult of dealing with immigration in the House, we were legitimized to \ndo so, in a germane way, in the Senate. We will do that.\n  At the same time, we all understand that in legislative procedures, \non cloture 60 votes are required. We have agreed to do so. Tomorrow, we \nwill vote--first on the Chambliss-Kyl amendment and then on the Craig \namendment. It will require 60 votes to proceed. Whether we succeed or \nfail--and I think I can succeed--what is most important is that the \nAmerican people are beginning to hear just a little bit about what they \nhave deserved to hear for the last 1,300 days, since \n9/11 awakened us all to the dysfunctional character and the lack of \nenforcement of immigration law that has been going on for well over two \ndecades. It was so typical of a Congress that wanted to talk a lot \nabout it but do very little about it.\n  The Senator from Arizona and I and the Senator from Georgia, without \nquestion, agree on the critical nature of American agriculture today. \nWhat we also agree on--symbolic by their presence on the floor today, \ndebating the issue and offering an alternative--is that we cannot build \nthe wall high enough along our southern border, we cannot dig its \nfoundation deep enough to close that border off, that it requires good, \nclear, simple, understandable, functioning law, not unlike the old \nBracero Program of the 1950s when we had a guest worker program, when \nwe identified the worker with the work, and they came, they worked, and \nthey went home.\n  Up until that time, illegal immigration was astronomically high. It \ndropped precipitously during that period of time when we were \nidentifying and being able to work about 500,000 workers who were \nforeign national in American agriculture. It was a law that worked.\n  Then somehow, in the sixties, Congress got it all wrong again. Why? \nBecause they thought they were protecting an American workforce. But \nwhat the AFL-CIO found out and why they support my legislation is that \nthere are unique types of employment in this country with which the \nAmerican workforce will not identify.\n  I am pleased to hear that the Chambliss-Kyl bill, along with mine, \nprovides a first-hire American approach. We create a labor pool. The \nemployer must first go there, but if that workforce is not available, \nthey do not have to languish there because, in essence, they have a \ncrop to harvest, and the crop is time sensitive. We understand all of \nthat.\n  I will get to the detail of my bill over the course of the afternoon \nand tomorrow. This is a bill that for 5 years has been worked out \nbetween now over 509 organizations. It is interesting that the Farm \nBureau supports the Kyl-Chambliss approach, but they do not oppose my \napproach. And last year they supported my approach. In other words, \nthey are as frustrated as all of us are about this very real problem of \nimmigration. First they are here and then they are there. What is most \nimportant is that we are here on the floor of the Senate this afternoon \ntalking about an issue on which this Senate has been absent way too \nlong.\n  What the Senator from Arizona, the Senator from Georgia, and I and \nothers who will be on the floor--I see my prime cosponsor Senator \nKennedy is on the floor--believe is that this is an issue whose time is \ncoming, and we believe for agriculture it is now because it is critical \nand it is necessary. We are learning at this moment that as much money \nas we throw at the border, as many Border Patrol men as we hire, if the \nlaw on the other side does not back them up, if the law on the other \nside does not create a reasonable pathway forward for a workforce to be \nlegal and a workforce that is necessary in this country, then you \ncannot put them along the border unless they are arm length to arm \nlength from the Gulf of Mexico to San Diego. And even then, those folks \nhave to sleep.\n  The reality is, we have to get the law right, and the law has been \nwrong for a great long while. In the absence of a functioning, \nreasonable law, we have set up for our country a human disaster. Not \nonly do we have an uncontrolled illegal population in our country, but \nbecause they have no rights, because of the way they are treated, it is \nnot unusual in the course of a given year to see 200 or 300 lose their \nlives along the southern border of our country, to see our emergency \nrooms in Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, and California flooded, to see the \nvery culture and the very character and foundation of our country at \nrisk because we do not control process, we do not control immigration, \nand we do not do so in an upright, legal, and responsible way.\n  We are here. We are going to debate this for a time, and there will \nbe much more debate tomorrow. We will have some key votes to see \nwhether we proceed to deal with the bill that I call AgJOBS and that \n509 organizations across the country that have worked with us for the \nlast 5 to 6 years call AgJOBS. It is a major reform in the H-2A law. It \nis a simplification. It is a clearer understanding. It is a reasonable \nprocess: The blue card, if you will, or the green card that is \nacceptable, normal, and understandable and provided in a temporary and \nearned way, as my bill does, is simply a point in transition, and it \nought to be viewed as that.\n  You will hear the rhetoric that it will allow millions of people to \nbecome legal. The Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Department of Labor, \ndoes not agree with that at all. The Department of Labor says there are \nabout 500,000 who they think will responsibly and legitimately come \nforward, and of that, there may be dependence of around 200,000 that \nare already in this country because that workforce has been here 5 or 6 \nyears or more, for that matter. So those numbers are reasonable and \nrealistic, and that is a moment in time, a transition as we create a \nlaw and allow American agriculture to work their way into a functioning \nrealistic H-2A program that is timely, that is sensitive, that \nmeets their workforce needs, and recognizes the value and the \nproduction of American agriculture.\n\n  If we do not correct this law and correct it now, Americans have a \nchoice because we already decided years ago, based on the character of \nthe work, that most Americans would not do it. They had better jobs and \nalternative jobs. So American agriculture began to rely on a foreign \nworkforce.\n  I say this most directly, and I mean it most sincerely. Either \nforeign workers will harvest America's agricultural produce for \nAmerica's consumers or foreign workers will harvest agriculture in \nanother country to be shipped to American consumers. Ask an American \ntoday what they want. They want a safe food supply. They\n\n[[Page S3778]]\n\nwant an abundant food supply. They hope it would be reasonably priced. \nBut most assuredly, they want to know that it is safe and it is \nreliable. The only way to guarantee that is that it be harvested in \nthis country, as it has been from the beginning history of our great \ncountry. It was not for 2 months last year and possibly not for 6 \nmonths this year.\n  We have a choice to make. We either create a legal workforce, a \nworkforce that is identifiable, or we keep stumbling down this road \nthat no American wants us to go down, and that is to not control our \nborders, to not identify the foreign nationals within our borders, and \nto not have a reasonable, legal, and timely process. That is what the \ndebate is all about.\n  I am pleased to see the other side, having been in opposition for so \nlong, finally say, Whoa, I think maybe we ought to try to get this \nright. We disagree on process, we disagree on their approach, but there \nis similarity in many instances on reform of the H-2A program. We will \nwork over the course of this afternoon, evening, and tomorrow to break \nall those differences out so all of our Senators can see these \ndifferences and sense the importance of what we debate.\n  There are many others who have come to the floor to discuss this \nlegislation this afternoon. I yield the floor so the debate can \nproceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the proposal \noffered by Senators Craig and Kennedy. I see Senator Kennedy on the \nfloor and Senator Craig on the floor. Their work is a testament to \ntheir persistence and the staying power of a handful of agricultural \nworkers and employers who have been willing to set aside ideology and \npartisanship to hammer out a major overhaul of our law in this area.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, will the Senator from Oregon yield for a \nprocedural question?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Oregon, we have the \nSenator from Massachusetts here, and the Senator from Alabama has been \nhere, as has the Senator from Georgia been on the floor when there was \nno one else present. I wonder if we can get some general agreement of \ngoing back and forth between proponents or opponents or proponents of \nthe two separate bills so the Chair has some idea of order and the \ndebate participants do as well.\n  I offer this as a suggestion. I have not proposed a unanimous consent \nrequest, but perhaps some of the staff can work this out while the \nSenator from Oregon is speaking.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KYL. Yes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Because our debate time, as I understand it, is actually \ntomorrow, and I think we will go off and on this issue today, and \nbecause the chairman of the Appropriations Committee is on the floor \nmanaging the supplemental and may have other amendments he wants to \ndeal with, I would hope we can rely on the Chair for moving us back and \nforth in a balanced way from side to side before we look at a \nstructured way to proceed. I have difficulty with that.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I join the Senator from Arizona in his \nrequest. I think it is important if we are to spend most of the \nafternoon on the issue. If we could work out an orderly arrangement, \nthat would be good.\n  Mr. KYL. Let me propose this unanimous consent, Mr. President, if I \nmay. The Senator from Oregon is speaking right now. I ask unanimous \nconsent that after the Senator from Oregon is finished, so there would \nhave been two Members speaking on behalf of the legislation of the \nSenator from Idaho, that at that point, the debate next go back and \nforth between proponents of the Chambliss-Kyl amendment and then back \nto Kennedy-Craig, and anyone offering an amendment can obviously seek \nto ask unanimous consent to lay the pending business aside, but in the \nmeantime the debate on these two provisions that will both be voted \nupon tomorrow proceed with speakers on either side rotating.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I see my friend from New Mexico who was \nhere before I was here. Let him proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I have two amendments to offer, and it \nwill take a total of about 3 minutes. I do not expect votes on them \ntoday, of course, but I would like a chance to very briefly offer them, \nand then have them set aside, if I can do that after the Senator from \nOregon concludes his remarks and before the rest of the debate \ncontinues.\n  Mr. KYL. That is accommodated in the unanimous consent request which \nI proposed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Reserving the right to object, I welcome the opportunity \nto work this out. Can we perhaps get some time understanding as well? \nThe Senator from Oregon mentioned he will probably need 15 minutes. \nCould we get some kind of understanding about the length of time? \nGenerally we go from Republican to Democrat. Now we are looking at \ngoing from proponents to opponents. I do not mind that, but if we can \nlimit this to 15 minutes each--I see we have a number of people--would \nthat be agreeable? So we would go to Senator Wyden, and because the \nSenator from Arizona has been so persuasive, we will hear two on his \nside, and maybe Senator Bingaman can be recognized after Senator Wyden, \nand then two for the Senator's side, 15 minutes each, and then I be \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KYL. I am happy to have my unanimous consent request amended \nalong the lines of what the Senator from Massachusetts said.\n  Mr. CRAIG. It is clear anybody coming to the floor to offer \namendments to the supplemental would have that right.\n  Mr. KYL. They could ask unanimous consent to intervene, and obviously \nit will be granted.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. KYL. Let me propound the unanimous consent request again, if I \ncan. I ask unanimous consent that in 15-minute blocks of time Senator \nWyden proceed without any of this time coming off his, there then be \ntwo 15-minute blocks for the Senator from Alabama and the Senator from \nGeorgia, followed by a 15-minute block for the Senator from \nMassachusetts, but in the meantime, Senator Bingaman be able to offer \nhis amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, a remarkable coalition of agricultural \nemployers and farm workers has come together behind the Craig-Kennedy \namendment. I commend them for all of their efforts. I simply wanted to \nspend a few minutes and talk about a bit of lineage behind this whole \neffort.\n  To some extent, this began on the afternoon of July 23, 1998, when I \nhad the opportunity to join with my friend and colleague Senator Gordon \nSmith and we offered an amendment to overhaul this program. It was, in \nfact, entitled the AgJOBS amendment. It had the strong support of \nSenator Craig at that time. We received 68 votes for that legislation. \nI think it was an indication then, as we see today, how the system \nworks for no one.\n  To a great extent, we see so many who feel we have lost control of \nour borders. The system surely does not work for the honest \nagricultural employer, and the vast majority certainly meet that test, \nand for many farm workers who work hard and contribute every single \nday. The system simply does not work for anyone. So what Senator Smith \nand I tried to do that July day in 1998 was to begin to address the \nfoundation of a sensible immigration policy based on the proposition \nthat what we have been doing does not work for anybody. It does not \nwork for our country.\n  We live under a contradiction every day with respect to immigration. \nWe say we are against illegal immigration. One can hear that in every \ncoffee shop in the United States. Then we look the other way so as to \ndeal with agriculture or perhaps motels, hotels, restaurants, and a \nvariety of other establishments. We have to resolve that contradiction. \nWe ought to resolve it by making the kind of start the Craig-Kennedy \nlegislation does by saying we\n\n[[Page S3779]]\n\nare going to put our focus on legal workers who are here in compliance \nwith the law. That is what we sought to do that July day in 1998, \nrequiring the growers to hire U.S. farmworkers first before they could \nseek alien workers. Then we took steps to try to ensure a measure of \njustice that would be required in our legislation for the migrant \nfarmworkers by providing employment, housing, transportation, and other \nbenefits, access to Head Start. I think Senator Kennedy remembers this \nwell from 1998. One would have thought Western civilization was going \nto end when that amendment offered by Oregon's two Senators got 68 \nvotes in the Senate. I think it was an indication of how the animosity \nand fear that has surrounded this issue has enveloped the whole debate \nover the last few years, and that is why I commend Senator Craig and \nSenator Kennedy for the thoughtful way they have worked since 1998 in \norder to build a coalition for this idea and to refine what the Senate \nvoted for in 1998.\n  For example, in 1999, the National Council of Agricultural Employers, \nthe employer group that helped start the process that led to the first \nAgJOBS bill of 1998, started reaching out directly to the Hispanic \ncommunity representing agricultural workers, as well as churches and \ncommunity groups. A dialog was begun then about how reform could \nbenefit everyone.\n  In 2000, people from the agricultural employer community and those \nrepresenting the farmworkers started talking more publicly about some \nof the issues that were particularly contentious. All of a sudden, \nthere was an extended and thoughtful debate among people who were \navowed enemies with respect to the topic of H-2A reform. Those people \nwho had fought each other so bitterly began to come together and form a \ncoalition that is behind the Craig-Kennedy amendment today.\n  In 1996, I formulated certain beliefs with respect to this issue that \nstill hold true today. First, I believe willing and able American \nworkers always should be given a chance to fulfill the needs of \nemployers seeking agricultural labor. This was addressed in 1998 and it \nremains in the language before the Senate today. The amendment offered \nby Senator Craig and Senator Kennedy requires employers seeking to use \nthe H-2A program to first offer the job to any eligible U.S. worker who \napplies and who is equally or better qualified for the job, and then \nissue notice to local and State employment agencies, farmworkers \norganizations, and also through advertising.\n  We also said back then we wanted to have recommendations for a more \nstraightforward, less cumbersome, less unwieldy process to address the \nshortage of primary foreign workers.\n  I commend Senator Craig and Senator Kennedy because what we had been \nconcerned about then--the need for simplicity and certainty--is now \nembodied in a number of aspects in this amendment. Employers are \nrequired to provide actual employment to the worker, a living wage and \nproof of that employment so the worker can move freely between jobs. \nThe employee is required to show proof of legal temporary worker status \nin the United States to the employer before becoming employed. Each \nparty shoulders the burden of ensuring their documentation is legal. \nThat is the way we said it ought to be in 1998. That is the way it is \nin the Craig-Kennedy proposal.\n  Third, I have always maintained and still maintain that a farmer \nusing the H-2A program should not be able to misuse it to displace U.S. \nagricultural workers or make U.S. workers worse off. The language \nbefore us today meets that test by ensuring that H-2A workers must be \npaid the same wage as the American worker. There is no incentive to \nseek a guest worker because there is no opportunity to indenture that \nworker by paying lower wages or not providing enough work.\n  Fourth, and perhaps most important, we said then and it is clear in \nthis amendment as well that any program must not encourage the illegal \nimmigration of workers. This bill addresses that by requiring \nagricultural workers to show they are legally in the United States in \norder to collect the benefits available under this program, such as \nhousing, transportation, and the civil right to sue their employers for \nback wages or for wrongful dismissal.\n  So the goal of this legislation is to take out some of the \nuncertainty and the lack of predictability that has been in this \nprogram, and that uncertainty would be removed for both growers and \nworkers.\n  Certainly my State has a great interest in agriculture. There are \ncertainly billions of dollars of direct economic output in this sector \nand there is a need to enact H-2A programs for my State, where we feel \nwe do a lot of things well, but what we do best is we grow things, and \nthe need for enacting this program is as great today as it was in 1998. \nBoth sides in this debate are going to continue to have their \ndifferences, and my guess is, as the Senator from Idaho knows, there \nare probably some residual and historical grudges. This Craig-Kennedy \nproposal shows that in a very contentious area that has been gridlocked \nin the Senate since a July date in 1998, we can still find a creative \nprocess that brings people together to solve mutual problems.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this historic effort. I look \nforward to working with Senators on both sides of the aisle on this \nmatter.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, what is the pending business? Is there \nan amendment pending?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending amendment is the Chambliss \namendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 483\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set that \naside so I can call up an amendment numbered 483.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 483.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To increase the appropriation to Federal courts by $5,000,000 \n  to cover increased immigration-related filings in the southwestern \n                             United States)\n\n       On page 202, strike line 24, and insert ``$65,000,000, to \n     remain available until September 30, 2006, of which \n     $5,000,000 shall be made available for costs associated with \n     increases in immigration-related filings in district courts \n     near the southwestern border of the United States:''.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this amendment would provide an \nadditional $5 million for the U.S. district courts along our southwest \nborder with Mexico. Due to the increased immigration enforcement \nefforts along that border, southwest border courts have seen an \nextraordinary increase in immigration-related filings. This amendment \nwould help border courts cover those expenses as we continue allocating \nresources to secure our Nation's borders.\n  Since 1995, immigration cases in the five southwest border \ndistricts--that is, the District of Arizona, District of New Mexico, \nSouthern District of California, and the Southern and Western Districts \nof Texas--have grown approximately 828 percent. In 2003, overall \nimmigration filings in all U.S. district courts surged 22 percent. In \n2004, they jumped 11 percent. Of those cases, 69 percent of them came \nfrom these five districts I have listed.\n  In recent years, Congress has appropriated millions of dollars to \nhire additional Border Patrol officers. Obviously, the more Border \nPatrol officers you have, the more cases you have coming into the \nFederal district courts. We need to recognize this. We need to \nrecognize the enormous impact this is having on our courts in this part \nof the country.\n  This amendment would add an additional $5 million to southwest border \ncourts to the existing $60 million that is currently allocated under \nthe supplemental to cover expenses related to recent Supreme Court \ndecisions and the class action bill. The Administrative Office of the \nCourts should be free to allocate the funds as it deems necessary among \nthe various courts. I hope my colleagues will support that amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 417\n\n  At this point I ask that amendment be set aside, and I call up \namendment\n\n[[Page S3780]]\n\nNo. 417, the Grassley-Baucus amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman], for Mr. \n     Grassley, for himself, Mr. Baucus, and Mr. Bingaman, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 417.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To provide emergency funding to the Office of the United \n                      States Trade Representative)\n\n       On page 200, between lines 13 and 14, insert the following:\n\n     OFFICE OF THE UNITED STATES TRADE REPRESENTATIVE\n\n       For an additional amount for necessary expenses of the \n     Office of the United States Trade Representative, $2,000,000, \n     to remain available until expended: Provided, That the entire \n     amount is designated as an emergency requirement pursuant to \n     section 402 of the conference report to accompany S. Con. \n     Res. 95 (108th Congress).\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this is an amendment I am offering on \nbehalf of Senator Grassley and Senator Baucus and myself. It would \nprovide an additional $2 million in funding to the Office of the U.S. \nTrade Representative for the balance of the current fiscal year. The \nreasons for the amendment are straightforward. As many of us have \nheard, because of the lack of funding, the Office of the Trade \nRepresentative has been forced to eliminate a substantial portion of \nits foreign travel. It has placed a freeze on all its hiring. It is \nessentially no longer able to do the job we are requiring it to do.\n  In my opinion, the U.S. Trade Representative's Office is chronically \nunderfunded and understaffed as it is. It is the principal agency in \ncharge of negotiating and enforcing our trade agreements, and it \ncertainly deserves our support, particularly in this time of \nunprecedented trade imbalances.\n  We talk a lot about holding our partners to their obligations in \ntrade agreements. We talk about protecting U.S. jobs. Unfortunately, we \nhave not dedicated a proper amount of resources to this effort.\n  This fiscal year, the Trade Representative's Office has faced \nunexpected additional constraints as a result of the WTO Ministerial, \ntravel related to enforcement, the need for more staff to pursue \ncongressionally mandated enforcement actions, and substantial \nfluctuations in the exchange rate, almost all of which fluctuations, I \nwould point out, have been adverse to the dollar.\n  This amendment will provide the Trade Representative's Office with \nthe emergency funding needed to get through this fiscal year. It is an \ninvestment well worth making. It will add to U.S. competitiveness and \neconomic security. I hope my colleagues will support the amendment.\n  I ask that amendment be set aside and the earlier amendment by \nSenator Chambliss be brought up again.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 483\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I do not see Senator Chambliss, but I \nwould like to enter into a discussion. We will be voting tomorrow on \nthe AgJOBS bill and the Kyl-Chambliss bill, and maybe other bills--the \nMikulski bill and who knows what else--in the next few days as we are \ndebating the emergency supplemental. These are amendments filed to the \nemergency supplemental, legislation to provide funding for our \nmagnificent soldiers who are ably serving our country in harm's way to \ncarry out a national policy that we sent them to carry out.\n  We have been told that since the House of Representatives, when they \npassed their emergency supplemental, added several provisions to \nenhance our border security, recommendations that were in substance \nmade by the 9/11 Commission to provide greater protection to our \ncountry against attacks by terrorists, such action by the House has \nopened the door to any immigration language and bill that we want to \noffer, that any Member may favor, to be added right onto a supplemental \nfor our soldiers. There is a tremendous difference between those \nprovisions, in my view. The Sensenbrenner language in the House bill is \nnarrow, based on recommendations of the 9/11 Commission, related to our \nnational defense and should have broad-based support. I hope it does. \nThe President supports it. The AgJOBS bill, however, is controversial. \nIt deals with a very large and complex subject that affects our economy \nand our legal system in a significant way. We absolutely should not be \nattempting to slip such legislation of such great importance, and on \nwhich our country is so divided, onto the emergency defense \nsupplemental.\n  Let me speak frankly on the issue. There is no legislative or \nnational consensus about how to fix our immigration system. I serve on \nthe subcommittee on immigration of the Senate Judiciary Committee. We \nhave been having a series of important hearings on this subject. Our \nchairman, Senator John Cornyn, has been working very hard and providing \nsound leadership, but our subcommittee and the full Judiciary Committee \nand this Senate are nowhere near ready to develop a comprehensive \nimmigration proposal. This is made clear when we see that a number of \noutstanding Senators who worked on immigration over the years--such as \nSenator Kyl, Senator Dianne Feinstein, Senator Saxby Chambliss--are \nworking on legislation, also.\n\n  Surely no one can say this AgJOBS bill that really kicked off this \ndebate is not a colossally important piece of legislation. Every one of \nus in this body knows that immigration is a matter of great importance \nto our country and one that we must handle carefully and properly. \nAfter the complete failure of the 1986 amnesty effort, surely we know \nwe must do better this time.\n  Let me state this clearly. I believe we can improve our laws \nregarding how people enter our country, how they work here, and how \nthey become citizens in this country, and we should do so. We \nabsolutely can do that. Many fine applicants are not being accepted, \napplicants who could enrich our Nation.\n  Further, as a prosecutor of 15 years, a Federal prosecutor for almost \nthat long, without hesitation I want to say this: If we improve our \nfundamental immigration laws and policies, and if at the same time we \nwork to create an effective enforcement system, then we can absolutely \neliminate this unconscionable lawlessness that is now occurring in our \ncountry and improve immigration policies across the board, serving our \nnational interests and being certainly more sensitive to the legitimate \ninterests of those who would like to come here, live here, work here, \nor even become citizens.\n  Any such legislation we pass should, in addition, protect our \nnational security. Of course, we need to keep an eye on our national \nsecurity--Have we forgotten that? Surely not--and allow increased \napproval for technically advanced, educated and skilled persons and \nstudents, as well as farm labor.\n  More importantly, under no circumstances should we pass bad \nlegislation that will further erode the rule of law, that will make the \ncurrent situation worse and will violate important principles that are \nessential for an effective national immigration policy.\n  Some will say, Well, Jeff, it is time to do something, even if it is \nnot perfect. My direct answer to that is it is past time to pass laws \nthat improve the ability of our country to protect our security from \nthose who would do us harm. That is our duty. But we simply are not \nready to legislate comprehensively on the complex issue of immigration.\n  We have not come close to completing our hearings in the appropriate \nsubcommittees and the Judiciary Committee.\n  More importantly still, time or not, we must not pass bad \nlegislation. The Nation tried amnesty for farmworkers in 1986 and few \nwould deny it was a failure. That legislation, the Immigration Reform \nand Control Act, established within it section 304. The Commission's \nduty was, after the act had been in effect for some time, to study its \nimpact on the American farming industry. The Commission issued its \nreport and found, in every area, farm labor problems had not been \nimproved and as many as 70 percent of the applications for amnesty were \nfraudulent.\n  I wish that weren't so. I wish we could pass laws that people conjure \nup\n\n[[Page S3781]]\n\nwhich would solve the complex problems and it will all just work like \nwe think it might. I am sure those people, in 1986, heard the exact \nsame argument we are hearing today why this kind of legislation is so \ncritical. They tried it. But they put in a commission to study it.\n  The Commission was clear. The Commission said:\n\n       In retrospect, the concept of worker specific and industry \n     specific legislation was fundamentally flawed.\n\n  That is exactly what the AgJOBS bill is, industry and worker \nspecific. Indeed, it is the same industry and the same workers--\nagriculture--that the 1986 sponsors said would be fixed by their bill. \nIt was an amnesty to end all amnesty. That is what they said. Now we \nare at it again in the same way.\n  Later, in 1997, former Congresswoman Barbara Jordan, an African-\nAmerican leader of national renown, was authorized, by a 1990 \nimmigration law, to chair a commission. The Commission reported to \nPresident Clinton on the status of existing immigration law. The Jordan \nCommission found that the guest worker programs do not ``reduce \nunauthorized migration. To the contrary, research consistently shows \nthat they tend to encourage and exacerbate illegal movements by setting \nup labor recruitment and family networks that persist long after the \nguest programs end.''\n  The Commission further concluded that what was needed was an \nimmigration system that had integrity where laws were enforced, \nincluding employer sanctions. I will quote from their report. They \nstated:\n\n       Illegal immigration must be curtailed. This should be \n     accomplished with more effective border controls, better \n     internal apprehension mechanisms, and enhanced enforcement of \n     employer sanctions. The U.S. Government should also develop a \n     better employment eligibility and identification system, \n     including a fraud-proof work authorization document for all \n     persons legally authorized to work in the United States so \n     that employer sanctions can more effectively deter the \n     employment of unauthorized workers.\n\n  Our enforcement efforts remind me of the man who builds an 8-foot \nladder to try to reach across a 10-foot chasm. While he may have been \nclose, close doesn't count in such an event. He is heading for \ndisaster.\n  We are not as far away as most people think from an effective \nenforcement mechanism. It is absolutely not hopeless for this country \nto gain control of its borders, especially with the new technology we \nhave today--biometrics and that kind of thing. We are spending billions \nof dollars, but we are spending that money very unwisely. The solution \nto our immigration situation is to review the procedures by which \npeople come to our country, and the procedures by which people become \ncitizens, and to then steadfastly plan a method that will work to \nenforce those rules. Without that enforcement, no matter what changes \nwe make in our current law, we will be right back here discussing \nAmnesty III for agricultural farmworkers before this decade is out. \nThis is plainly obvious to anyone who would look at our current system.\n  By all means, this Nation should not, in response to this current \nfailure, pass a bill like what has been offered which basically says \nour current system has failed and we intend to give up and do nothing \nto fix it. It says we have failed, our system is not working so we are \njust going to quit trying and let everybody stay in. The American \npeople are not going to be happy if they learn that is what we are \nabout here. They surely will learn about it sooner or later.\n\n  Polls show huge majorities, upwards of 80 percent, want a lawful \nsystem of immigration. Why are we resistant to that?\n  It has been amazing to me, anytime a piece of legislation is offered \nthat might actually work to tighten up the loopholes we have, it is \nsteadfastly opposed and seems never to become law.\n  I feel very strongly about this. If it is not amnesty, I don't know \nwhat amnesty is.\n  This bill will bestow legal status and a guaranteed pass to \ncitizenship for over a million individuals, perhaps 3 million, perhaps \neven more.\n  The Commissioners who studied the last bill all agreed the number \nthat actually obtained amnesty was far greater than anticipated.\n  In addition, it makes no provision whatsoever for commensurate \nimprovement of law enforcement.\n  It hurts me, as somebody who spent most of my professional life \ntrying to enforce laws passed by Congress, to see us undermine the \nability of our system to actually work.\n  The passage of this legislation will be the equivalent of placing a \nneon sign on our border that says: Yes, we have laws but we welcome you \nto try to sneak into our country, and if you are successful, we will \nreward you, as we have done twice before, with permanent residency and \na step onto citizenship.\n  Under this legislation, if a person has worked within 18 months, 575 \nhours or 100 workdays--and a workday is defined in the act as working 1 \nhour--then for 100 hours within 18 months, they are eligible to apply \nfor a temporary resident status even though they are here plainly and \nutterly illegally. They do not have to go home and make another \napplication; they simply apply for this. In addition, they become a \ntemporary resident.\n\n  It then provides they can ask for permanent resident status and that \nthe Secretary of Homeland Security shall grant them this permanent \nresident status if they work 2,000 hours in a 6-year period. That is \nabout 1 year of work period. Then they apply for a permanent resident \nstatus. In 5 years, if they have not been convicted of a felony or have \nnot been convicted of three misdemeanors, the Secretary shall confer \ncitizenship on them if they apply.\n  If they become a permanent resident citizen, they can call for their \nfamily, who may be out of the country. A family who never had any \nthought to come to this country is allowed to come in free. All of them \nare put on a guaranteed track for citizenship.\n  Indeed, if they have already left the country not intending to \nreturn, but did work 575 hours in 18 months before that period, or if \nthey are willing to say they did--true or not--they get to come back in \nand bring their families with them. Maybe a person here never intended \nto bring their family, but faced with this offer, they bring them in.\n  I am not sure we know how broad this bill is, how dangerous this \nlanguage is.\n  I have a host of specific complaints about the provisions within the \nstatute. I will talk about them later today or tomorrow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I concur in about everything my friend \nfrom Alabama has said. Initially, he made a comment relative to \ndebating immigration law on a Defense supplemental bill where we are \ntrying to provide funds for our men and women who are serving so \nbravely overseas today. I concur in that.\n  I had hoped we would have an expansive debate on this very sensitive \nand complicated issue. I know my friend, the Senator from Idaho, feels \nexactly as I do on this, but unfortunately we have been dictated to by \nthe rules of the Senate relative to this issue. That is why we have \nboth of these amendments up for discussion today.\n  The Senator from Alabama is exactly right. He is also right on one \nother thing. There are two amendments we are debating, AgJOBS, filed by \nthe Senator from Idaho and Senator Kennedy from Massachusetts, and the \nChambliss-Kyl amendment. Both of these amendments recognize, as the \nSenator from Alabama said, we have a problem. We have a problem in the \nagriculture community relative to providing our farmers all across \nAmerica a stable, secure, and lawful pool from which to choose for \ntheir labor needs.\n  We can argue over how many hundreds of thousands or how many millions \nof individuals are illegally in this country today working on our \nfarms. The Senator from Idaho said the Department of Labor says there \nwill only be a few hundred thousand who will try to take advantage of \nthis. I don't think that is right. I don't have a lot of faith in the \nnumbers coming out of some of the studies that have been done.\n  For example, there was a study by GAO a couple of years ago which \nsaid there were some 600,000 farmworkers in the United States today who \nare here illegally. In my State, there are hundreds of thousands of \nillegal aliens who are working in agriculture as well as working in \nother industries today.\n\n[[Page S3782]]\n\nThose who are working in other industries probably started out working \nin agriculture. That is 1 out of 50 States. Our number is dwarfed by \nTexas, New Mexico, Arizona, California, by those States that are on the \nborder with our friends to the South in Mexico, where thousands of \nillegal aliens are crossing the border every day.\n  However, we do recognize there is a certain number--and it is not \nmaterial as to what that number is--but the fact is we agree there are \nhundreds of thousands or millions of folks here illegally.\n  The basic difference between the Senator Craig and Senator Kennedy \nAgJOBS amendment and the Chambliss-Kyl amendment is this: Which \ndirection do we want to go with regard to identifying those folks here \nillegally? Do we want to reward those folks here illegally, as the \nAgJOBS amendment proposes to do, or do we want to identify those people \nand those who are here illegally who are making a valuable contribution \nto the economy of the United States and who, most significantly, are \nnot displacing American workers--and I emphasize that--and who have not \nbroken the law in this country? Do we want to make an accommodation for \nthose folks so they can continue to contribute to the economy of the \nUnited States by virtue of working in the agriculture community?\n  We both agree we ought to regulate these folks. The difference is the \nCraig-Kennedy AgJOBS amendment gives those individuals who are in this \ncountry illegally a direct path to citizenship. The Chambliss-Kyl \namendment recognizes those folks are here illegally and it says to \nthem, we are going to grant you a temporary status to remain here if \nyou are not displacing American workers, if you are law abiding, and if \nyour employer makes an attestation that he needs you--whether it is for \na short period of time, as the H-2A reform portion of our amendment \ncalls for, or whether it is the longer term, or the blue card \napplication. Unlike in the AgJOBS amendment where the illegal alien can \nmake the application, in our amendment the application has to be made \nby the employer who does have to say he needs that individual in his \nemploy.\n  Another significant difference between these two amendments is this: \nUnder the AgJOBS bill it is pretty easy in the scheme of things to \nbecome legal--not maybe an American citizen off the bat, but to \nposition yourself to be placed in line ahead of other folks who are \ngoing through the normal course as set forth in our Constitution today \nto become a citizen, for these folks to make that type of application.\n  Here is why. The AgJOBS bill says if you are an illegal alien, you \nshall be given status as one lawfully admitted for temporary residence \nif the illegal alien has worked 575 hours, or 100 workdays, whichever \nis less, during an 18-month period ending on December 31, 2004. Mr. \nPresident, 575 hours is 14.3 weeks of labor if they work 40 hours, or \n71.8 days, or approximately 3\\1/2\\ months. An alien can get immigration \nstatus after working only 3\\1/2\\ months of full-time employment.\n  Under Senate bill 359, section 2, paragraph 7, a workday means a day \nin which an individual has worked as little as 1 hour. So 100 workdays \ncan amount to, literally, 1 hour per day for 100 straight days which \nwould amount to 2\\1/2\\ weeks. That may not be the practicality of this, \nbut in actuality, that is what the bill says.\n  Coming from a very heavy agriculture area, as I do, these people for \nthe most part who are here working in agriculture are here for the \nreason they want to improve the quality of life for themselves as well \nas their families. They are basically law-abiding people who are simply \nhard workers and are here because they have that opportunity to better \nthemselves in this country versus their native country.\n  But still, are we going to recognize those folks for what they are--\nand that is an illegal alien--or are we going to grant them this legal \nstatus after being here for 3\\1/2\\ months?\n  I do not think the American people ever intended for the Constitution \nof the United States, and for us operating under that Constitution, to \ngrant legal status to anybody who breaks the law, to come into this \ncountry, and who may break the law not once, not twice, but three times \nduring that 3\\1/2\\-month period under the AgJOBS bill, as they can do, \nand get legal status. I cannot conceive that America wants us to enact \nthat type of legislation.\n  A basic difference between the AgJOBS bill and the Chambliss-Kyl \namendment relative to those issues is we do not put anybody on a path \nto legal status. We grant them temporary status under the H-2A bill. If \nthe farmer comes in and says, ``I need 100 workers for 90 days to work \non my farm, and here is what they are going to do,'' we will have that \napplication processed in a streamlined fashion, compared to the way the \napplication would have to be processed today, and those workers can \ncome in, and whether they are cutting lettuce or cutting cabbage or \npicking cucumbers, they will be able to come in for that 100 days, and \nat the end of that 100 days, they will return to their native land.\n  If there are other operations, other farming operations, whether it \nis a landscaper or somebody in the nursery business, that need \nindividuals 12 months out of the year, they will have the opportunity \nunder our bill to apply for the blue card--again, a temporary status. \nIt must be applied for by the employer, not the illegal alien, as you \ncan do under the AgJOBS bill. The employer must make the application \nfor those individuals. No preferential status toward citizenship is \ngiven.\n  They can have that blue card for 3 years, and reapply on two separate \noccasions following that first application. Technically, they could \nstay here for 9 years, if they continue to be law abiding and if their \nemployer makes the proper attestation that says he needs them, that \nthey have been important to the economy of this country, and they are \nnot displacing American workers. It is significantly different from \nactually the legal status given after 3\\1/2\\ months under the AgJOBS \nbill.\n  Where does the AgJOBS bill move this individual relative to the \npathway to citizenship? What current immigration law says is for \nsomebody who is here legally, if they work for 2,060 hours under the \nAgJOBS bill, at the end of that 1 year, which is approximately 2,060 \nhours of work, they can apply for a green card, and they are going to \nbe given preferential treatment in getting that green card.\n  What current immigration law says is anybody who has maintained a \ngreen card for 5 years can apply for citizenship. That is the pathway \nto citizenship that is being granted to folks who are in this country \nillegally today, who can have broken the law in this country today, not \nonce, not twice, but three times, and still be looked at as somebody \nwho is given preferential treatment over those individuals who are \noutside of this country who want to become citizens of the United \nStates, who want to come here legally and do it the right way.\n  It simply is not fair. It is not equitable. I cannot believe the \nAmerican people want to see us enact a law that will reward those \nindividuals who have come into this country illegally in that way.\n  Lastly, let me mention one other point that is critically different \nbetween the AgJOBS bill and the Chambliss-Kyl amendment; and that is \nthe issue relative to control of the border. The AgJOBS bill is \nbasically silent when it comes to control of the border. But what it \ndoes do is it says if you have previously worked in the United States, \nand you are now back in your home country, you can come and make \napplication for the adjusted status by saying you did work 575 hours \nwithin a certain period of time and, therefore, you should be given \nlegal status in this country. And that will happen.\n  The difference in our provisions relative to control of the border is \nwe mandate that the Department of Homeland Security come back to \nCongress within 6 months after the effective date of this legislation \nand report to us on a plan they are going to put in place to control \nour borders. Because, let me tell you, I don't care what bill we pass, \nwhich of these amendments we pass, or any future bill we may pass \nrelative to the immigration laws of this country, if we do not control \nour borders, we have not made one positive step in the right direction.\n  We simply must figure out a way to control our borders. We think \nrather than us legislating a way in which that\n\n[[Page S3783]]\n\nbe done, those folks who deal with the issue every day, those folks at \nthe Department of Homeland Security, are better suited to determine how \nwe can come up with a plan to control the border. We mandate that they \ncome back to us with that plan to control the border within 6 months \nafter the effective date of this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I would simply say in closing, we agree, No. 1, there \nis a problem. I commend Senator Craig and Senator Kennedy for \ncontinuing to move this ball down the field, as they have done. While I \ndo not necessarily agree that the Iraq supplemental is the right place \nto do it, we are here today. But it simply is a matter of in which \ndirection we are going to go.\n\n  Is it going to be looking at folks who are in this country illegally \nand rewarding them, rewarding them with a path to citizenship? Or is it \ngoing to be in the direction of saying, OK, we know you are here \nillegally, but if you are here and are a law-abiding individual in this \ncountry, and you are making a contribution to this society, and you are \nnot displacing an American worker, then we are going to give you a \ntemporary status? We are not going to say you are here illegally. We \nare going to say you are here legally, temporarily.\n  That is a critical difference. We are going to make sure our farmers \nand our ranchers have the workforce necessary to carry out the job they \nmust do of feeding Americans as well as other folks around the world, \nbut we are simply not going to use that tool to put people who are here \nillegally on a pathway to one of the most precious rights every \nAmerican citizen has, and that is citizenship of this country.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized \nfor 15 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If the Chair would be good enough to notify me when I \nhave 1 minute remaining, please.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will be happy to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join with Senator \nCraig in offering the Agricultural Jobs, Opportunity, Benefits, and \nSecurity amendment.\n  America has a proud tradition as a nation of immigrants and a nation \nof laws, but our current immigration laws have failed us. Much of the \nNation's economy today depends on the hard work and the many \ncontributions of immigrants. The agricultural industry would grind to a \nhalt without immigrant farmworkers. Yet the overwhelming majority of \nthese workers are undocumented and are, therefore, easily exploited by \nunscrupulous employers.\n  Our AgJOBS bill corrects these festering problems. It gives \nfarmworkers and their families the dignity and justice they deserve, \nand it gives agricultural employers a legal workforce.\n  Impressive work has been done by many grassroots organizations to \nmake AgJOBS a reality. They have demonstrated true statesmanship by \nputting aside strongly held past differences to work together for the \ncommon good. We have our own responsibility to join in a similar way to \napprove this needed reform that is years overdue.\n  I commend Senator Craig and Congressmen Berman and Cannon for their \nleadership. I urge my colleagues to wholeheartedly endorse the AgJOBS \nbill.\n  Our bill reflects a far-reaching and welcome agreement between the \nUnited Farm Workers and the agricultural industry to meet this urgent \nneed, and Congress should make the most of this unique opportunity for \nprogress.\n  Our bill has strong support from business and labor, civic and faith-\nbased organizations, liberals and conservatives, trade associations and \nimmigrant rights groups. More than 500 organizations across the country \nsupport it.\n  AgJOBS is a bipartisan compromise reached after years of \nnegotiations. Both farmworkers and growers have made concessions to \nreach this agreement, but each side has obtained important benefits.\n  In contrast, opponents offer a one-sided proposal that has failed to \nwin the broad support AgJOBS has received. I urge my colleagues to \noppose it. It vastly favors employers at the expense of farmworkers. It \nmakes harsh revisions to the current agricultural guest worker program \nand creates a new blue card program for undocumented workers without a \npath to permanent residence, and without any meaningful governmental \noversight to prevent labor abuses.\n  Agricultural employers would have the freedom to avoid hiring U.S. \nworkers, displace U.S. workers already on the job, and force both U.S. \nworkers and guest workers to accept low wages. They could do all this \nby claiming they can't find any U.S. workers. Even when the few labor \nprotections are violated, workers would have no meaningful ability to \nenforce their legal rights.\n  This program would return us to the dark and shameful era of the \nBracero Program where abuses were rampant and widely tolerated. That is \nunacceptable. We must learn from our mistakes and not repeat them.\n  The Chambliss amendment also ignores the needs of many growers and \nfarmworkers. It offers no solution to the basic problem faced by \nagricultural employers--the problem that an overwhelming majority of \nthe workers are undocumented. By offering no path to permanent \nresidence for these undocumented workers, none of the guest workers, no \nmatter how long they have worked, will ever be able to earn their \npermanent status.\n  Perhaps more troubling is the amendment's repeal of the longstanding \nadverse effect wage rate under the current program. This wage rate was \ncreated during the Bracero Program as a necessary program against the \ndepression in wages caused by guest worker programs. The Chambliss \nproposal would replace it with a prevailing wage standard, \nsubstantially lower than the adverse effect wage rate. It would be \nbased on the employer's own survey of prevailing wages rather than the \nLabor Department's survey. Farmworkers, who are already the lowest paid \nworkers in the United States, would see their wages drop even lower. In \ncontrast, the AgJOBS bill preserves the adverse effect wage rate while \nrecommendations are made to Congress to resolve these long-contested \npay issues.\n  The Chambliss amendment also eliminates the key provision that gives \nU.S. workers a job preference by employers who request guest workers. \nIt would end the longstanding 50 percent rule which requires employers \nto hire qualified U.S. workers who applied during the first half of the \nseason. Studies have shown that this rule is a valid protection.\n  In addition, the Chambliss amendment would end what they call \npositive recruitment--the obligation of employers to look for U.S. \nworkers outside of the government job service which currently provides \nfarmworkers with agricultural jobs. This proposal creates a new guest \nworker program for the undocumented that would offer them visas that \nwould be valid only for 3 years and renewable for up to 6 additional \nyears. They would have no opportunity to earn a green card no matter \nhow many years they worked in the United States. In fact, they would \nactually lose their status if they merely filed an application to \nbecome a permanent resident.\n  Senator Chambliss believes that undocumented farmworkers will come \nout of the shadows and sign up for such a temporary worker program, but \nthey are highly unlikely to do so. The vast majority will be deported \nafter their temporary status expires. Registering as the first step \ntowards deportation is unfair, and it just won't work.\n  In contrast, the AgJOBS bill offers farmworkers a genuine earned \nadjustment program that will put these workers and their families on a \npath to permanent residence. Hard-working, law-abiding farmworkers will \nbe able to come out of the shadows. The Chambliss amendment is far less \nsatisfactory than the AgJOBS proposal, and I urge my colleagues to \noppose it.\n  Opponents of the AgJOBS bill claim that we are rushing this bill \nthrough Congress without full and careful consideration. This claim is \nwithout merit. Since 1998, the Immigration Subcommittee has held three \nhearings that have fully examined our agricultural workforce problems \nand the need to reform our immigration laws. Last year, we considered \nthe issue once more. Legislation to address this problem has been \nintroduced by both Republicans and Democrats in every Congress since \n1996.\n\n[[Page S3784]]\n\n  In September 2000, a breakthrough occurred, and both sides agreed to \nsupport compromise legislation that won broad bipartisan congressional \nsupport. Unfortunately, attempts to enact it were blocked in the \nlameduck session that year. The election of President Bush in 2000 \nchanged the dynamics of the agreement, and the compromise fell apart.\n  A compromise was finally reached in September 2003 which led Senator \nCraig and me to introduce the AgJOBS bill. Last Congress, we had, as \nSenator Craig has pointed out, 63 Senate cosponsors, nearly evenly \ndivided between Democrats and Republicans. Despite such strong \nbipartisan support, the leadership last year blocked our attempt to \nobtain a vote on this legislation. This is the second Congress in which \nSenator Craig and I have introduced the AgJOBS bill. Congress has had \nextensive discussions of this legislation in the past, and it is long \npast time for us to act.\n  Opponents of our amendment have offered no workable solutions. We \ncannot be complacent any longer. It is time for a new approach.\n  The American people want commonsense solutions to real problems such \nas immigration. They want neither open borders nor closed borders. They \nwant smart borders. They are neither anti-immigrant nor anti-\nenforcement. Instead, they are anti-disorder and anti-hypocrisy. They \nwant the Federal Government to get its act together, to set rules that \nare realistic and fair, and to follow through and enforce these \nrealistic rules effectively and efficiently.\n  AgJOBS meets these goals. It addresses our national security needs, \nreflects current economic realities, and respects America's immigrant \nheritage.\n  The status quo is untenable. In the last 10 years, the U.S. \nGovernment has spent more than $20 billion to enforce our immigration \nlaws. We have tripled the number of border security agents, improved \nsurveillance technology, installed other controls to strengthen border \nenforcement, especially at the southwest border. None of these efforts \nhave been adequate. Illegal immigration continues.\n  The proof is in the numbers. Between 1990 and 2000, the number of \nundocumented immigrants doubled from 3.5 million to 7 million. Today \nthat number is nearly 11 million, with an average annual growth of \nalmost 500,000. Those already here are not leaving, and new immigrants \nkeep coming in. Massive deportations are unrealistic as a policy, \nimpractical to carry out, and unacceptable to businesses that rely \nheavily on their labor.\n  Obviously, we must control our borders and enforce our laws, but we \nfirst need realistic immigration laws that we can actually enforce. The \nAgJOBS bill is a significant step. By bringing these illegal workers \nout of the shadows, we will enable law enforcement to focus its efforts \non terrorists and violent criminals. We will reduce the chaotic, \nillegal, all too deadly traffic of immigrants at our borders by \nproviding safe opportunities for farmworkers and their families to \nenter and leave the country.\n  The AgJOBS bill enhances our national security and makes our \ncommunities safer. It brings the undocumented farmworkers and their \nfamilies out of the shadows and enables them to pass through security \ncheckpoints. It shrinks the pool of law enforcement targets, enables \nour offices to train their sights more effectively on the terrorists \nand the criminals. The undocumented farmworkers eligible for this \nprogram will undergo rigorous security checks as they apply for legal \nstatus. Future temporary workers will be carefully screened to meet \nsecurity concerns.\n  The AgJOBS amendment provides a fair and reasonable way for \nundocumented agricultural workers to earn legal status. It reforms the \ncurrent visa program so that agricultural employers unable to hire \nAmerican workers can hire needed foreign workers. Both of these \ncomponents are critical. They serve as the cornerstone for \ncomprehensive immigration reform of the agricultural sector.\n  Undocumented farmworkers are clearly vulnerable to abuse by \nunscrupulous labor contractors and growers. They are less likely than \nU.S. workers to complain about low wages, poor working conditions, or \nother labor law violations. Their illegal status deprives them of \nbargaining power and depresses the wages of all farmworkers. These \nworkers are already among the lowest paid of all workers in America. \nAccording to the most recent findings of the national agricultural \nworkers survey issued last month, their average individual income is \nbetween $10,000 and $12,000 a year. The average annual family income is \n$15,000 to $17,000.\n  Thirty percent of their households live below the poverty line. Only \nhalf of them own a car and even fewer own a home or even a trailer. By \nlegalizing these farmworkers, the threat of deportation is removed. \nThey will be on equal footing with U.S. workers and the end result will \nbe higher wages, better working conditions, and upward job mobility for \nall workers.\n  Opponents of reform continually mislabel any initiative they oppose \nas ``amnesty'' in a desperate attempt to stop any significant reform. \nInstead of proposing ways to fix our current broken system, they are \ncalling for more of the same--increased enforcement of broken laws. \nHowever, enforcing a dysfunctional system only leads to greater \ndysfunction.\n  The AgJOBS bill is not an amnesty bill. The program requires \nfarmworkers to earn legal status. They must demonstrate not only \ncontributions but also a substantial future work commitment before they \nearn the right to remain in our country.\n  First, they will receive temporary resident status, based on their \npast work experience. They must have worked for at least 100 work days \nin agriculture by December 31, 2004. To earn permanent residence, they \nmust fulfill a prospective work requirement. They must work at least \n360 days in agriculture during a six-year period. At least 240 of those \n360 work days must occur during the first 3 years. Temporary residents \nwho fail to fulfill the prospective agricultural work requirement will \nbe dropped from the program and required to leave the country.\n  It's not amnesty if you have to earn it. AgJOBS offers farm workers a \nfair deal: if they are willing to work hard for us, then we're willing \nto do something fair for them. It's the only realistic solution.\n  Contrary to statements made by its critics, AgJOBS does not provide a \ndirect path to citizenship. Farm workers would first earn temporary \nresidence if they provide evidence of past work in agriculture. The \nnext step would be permanent residence, but only after they have \ncompleted thousands of hours of backbreaking work in agriculture--a \nprocess that could take up to 6 years. Once they earn permanent \nresidence, these farm workers would have to wait another 5 years to be \nable to apply for citizenship. At that point, they would have to pass \nan English and civics exam, and go through extensive backgrounds \nchecks. This process is long and arduous, as it should be. There is \nnothing direct about it.\n  To be eligible for legal status, applicants must be persons of good \nmoral character and present no criminal or national security problems. \nWhether they are applying here or at U.S. consulates abroad, all \napplicants will be required to undergo rigorous security clearances. \nLike all applicants for adjustment of status, their names and birth \ndates must be checked against criminal and terrorist databases operated \nby the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI, the State Department, \nand the CIA. Applicants' fingerprints would be sent to the FBI for a \ncriminal background check, which includes comparing the applicants' \nfingerprints with all arrest records in the FBI's database.\n  Contrary to arguments made by detractors of AgJOBS, terrorists will \nnot be able to exploit this program to obtain legal status. Anyone with \nany ties to terrorist activity is ineligible for legal status under our \ncurrent immigration laws, and would be ineligible under the AgJOBS \nbill. Our proposal has no loopholes for terrorists.\n  Opponents of AgJOBS claim that this bill is soft on criminals. Wrong \nagain. AgJOBS has the toughest provisions against those who commit \ncrimes--tougher than current immigration law. Convictions for most \ncrimes will make them ineligible to obtain a green card. Generally, \nthese convictions include violent crimes, drug crimes, theft, and \ndomestic violence. AgJOBS goes even further. Applicants can be denied \nlegal status if they commit a felony or three\n\n[[Page S3785]]\n\nmisdemeanors. It doesn't matter whether the misdemeanors involve minor \noffenses--three misdemeanors and you are out, no matter how minor the \nmisdemeanors. In addition, anyone convicted of a single misdemeanor who \nserved a sentence of 6 months or more would also be ineligible. These \nrules are additional requirements that do not apply to other immigrants \nand they cannot be waived by DHS.\n  There are those who would prefer to disqualify a farm worker who \ncommits even a single minor misdemeanor, with no jail time. But that \ngoes too far. In some States, it's a misdemeanor to put trash from your \nhome into a roadside trash can. It's a misdemeanor to park a house \ntrailer in a roadside park, or have an unleashed dog in your car on a \nState highway, or go fishing without a license.\n  If we're serious about this proposal, minor offenses like these \nshouldn't have such harsh consequences. We'd be severely punishing \nhard-working men and women for minor mistakes, and tearing these \nimmigrant families apart.\n  It's hard to imagine any public purpose that would be served by such \na severe punishment. But it's easy to imagine all the heart-wrenching \nstories and nightmares created by this proposal for people caught by \nits provisions. Many of these farm workers have lived in America with \ntheir families for many years. They've established strong ties to their \ncommunities, paid their taxes, and contributed to our economy. They \ndeserve better than a punishment out of all proportion to their \noffense.\n  Opponents of AgJOBS also claim that it will be a magnet for further \nillegal immigration. Once again, they are wrong. To be eligible for the \nearned adjustment program, farm workers must establish that they worked \nin agriculture in the past. Farm workers must have entered the United \nStates prior to October, 2004. Otherwise, they are not eligible. The \nmagnet argument is false. New entrants who have not worked in \nagriculture won't qualify for this program.\n  Hard-working migrant farm workers are essential to the success of \nAmerican agriculture. We need an honest agriculture policy that \nrecognizes the contributions of these men and women, and respects and \nrewards their work.\n  Our bill will modify the current temporary foreign agricultural \nworker program, while preserving and enhancing key labor protections. \nIt strikes a fair balance. Anything else would undermine the jobs, \nwages, and working conditions of U.S. workers.\n  For many employers, the current program is a bureaucratic nightmare. \nFew of them use the program, because it is so complicated, lengthy, \nuncertain, and expensive. Only 40,000-50,000 guest workers are admitted \neach year--barely 2 to 3 percent of the estimated total agricultural \nwork force.\n  To deal with these problems, the bill streamlines the H-2A program's \napplication process by making it a ``labor attestation'' program \nsimilar to the H-1B program, rather than the current ``labor \ncertification'' program. This change will reduce paperwork for \nemployers and accelerate processing.\n  Employers seeking temporary workers will file an application with the \nSecretary of Labor containing assurances that they will comply with the \nprogram's obligations. The application will be accompanied by a job \noffer that the local job service office will post on an electronic job \nregistry at least 28 days before the job begins. In addition, the \nemployer must post the position at the work site, notify the collective \nbargaining representative if one exists, make reasonable efforts to \ncontact past employees, and advertise the position in newspapers read \nby farm workers.\n  Longstanding worker protections will continue in force. For example, \nthe ``three-fourths minimum work guarantee'' will remain in effect. \nEmployers will be required to guarantee work for at least three \nquarters of the employment period or pay compensation for any \nshortfall. The ``50% rule'' will also continue. Qualified U.S. workers \nwould be hired as long as they apply during the first half of the \nseason. No position could be filled by an H-2A worker that was vacant \nbecause of a strike or labor dispute. Employers will continue to \nreimburse workers for transportation costs and provide workers' \ncompensation insurance coverage. Employers will be prohibited from \ndiscriminating in favor of temporary workers.\n  The bill will modify some current requirements in important ways. \nEmployers must provide housing at no cost, or a monetary housing \nallowance in which the State governor certifies that sufficient farm \nworker housing is available. Employers will also be required to pay at \nleast the highest of the State or Federal minimum wage, the local \n``prevailing wage'' for the particular job, or an ``adverse effect'' \nwage rate.\n  For many years, the adverse effect wage rate has been vigorously \ndebated, with most farm worker advocates arguing that the rate is too \nlow, and most growers complaining that it is too high. The bill will \nfreeze adverse effect wage rates for three years at the 2003 level, \nwhile studies and recommendations are made to Congress by the GAO and a \nspecial commission of experts. If Congress fails to enact an adverse \neffect wage rate formula within 3 years, this wage rate will be \nadjusted in 2006, and at the beginning of each year thereafter, based \non the change in the consumer price index.\n  The Secretary of Labor will establish an administrative complaint \nprocess to investigate and resolve complaints alleging violations under \nthe H-2A program. Violators will be required to pay back wages, and can \nalso be given civil money penalties and be barred from the program.\n  In addition, the bill provides a significant new protection for H-2A \nworkers--a private right of action in Federal court. Currently, these \nworkers lack this right, and can seek redress in State courts only \nunder State contract law. Such workers are also excluded from the \nMigrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act, which provides \nU.S. workers with protections and remedies in Federal court. Although \nthe exclusion continues, our bill will permit workers to file a Federal \nlawsuit to enforce their wages, housing benefits, transportation cost \nreimbursements, minimum-work guarantee, motor vehicle safety \nprotections, and other terms under their job offer.\n  Our bill will also unify families. When temporary residence is \ngranted, a farm worker's spouse and minor children will be able to \nremain legally in the United States, but they will not be authorized to \nwork. When the worker becomes a permanent resident, the spouse and \nminor children will also gain such status.\n  Mr. President, I have a letter from the AFL-CIO that calls AgJOBS a \nrecent legislative compromise between farmworker advocates and \nagricultural employers. I ask unanimous consent that this letter be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial \n           Organizations,\n                                   Washington, DC, April 18, 2005.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the AFL-CIO I urge you to \n     support cloture on and passage of an amendment to the FY 2005 \n     Supplemental Appropriations bill offered by Senators Craig \n     and Kennedy--the Agricultural Job Opportunity, Benefits and \n     Security Act (AgJOBS). I also strongly urge you to oppose an \n     amendment offered by Senators Chambliss and Kyl as a \n     substitute to AgJOBS. This amendment has inadequate worker \n     protections and must be defeated.\n       The AgJOBS bill is a reasoned legislative compromise \n     between farm worker advocates and agricultural employers. \n     AgJOBS enjoys strong bipartisan support and would provide an \n     avenue for 500,000 undocumented farm workers to qualify for \n     an earned adjustment program that has a path to permanent \n     residency. AgJOBS would both streamline the current H-2A \n     agricultural guest-worker program and provide additional \n     legal protections for migrant workers who hold H-2A visas. \n     AgJOBS addresses both the growing concern over the high \n     number of undocumented farm workers and the need for \n     adjustments to the H-2A program so that we do not confront a \n     similar crisis in the future. The Kennedy-Craig AgJOBS \n     amendment is necessary immigration reform that will protect \n     the rights and economic well-being of both immigrant and U.S. \n     workers.\n       The Chambliss-Kyl proposal would radically change the H-2A \n     program--stripping it of all labor protections and government \n     oversight. This amendment would create a new year-round guest \n     worker program with no meaningful labor protections and no \n     role for the Department of Labor to enforce housing, pay, or \n     other essential worker protections. The Chambliss-Kyl \n     proposal would tie workers to particular employers and \n     require\n\n[[Page S3786]]\n\n     them to leave the country if their jobs ended and no other \n     employer petitioned for a visa for them within 60 days. It \n     would allow employers to bring in a large numbers of \n     vulnerable guest workers to fill year-round jobs for up to \n     nine years without the ability to be united with their family \n     members.\n       Also troubling is that the Chambliss-Kyl amendment would \n     broaden the definition of seasonal agricultural workers to \n     include ``related industries,'' which could include \n     landscaping and food processing. Currently, the use of guest \n     workers in these industries is capped and subject to \n     additional labor market tests. The H-2A program is not \n     subject to a cap. This further jeopardizes essential labor \n     protections for a broader segment of the U.S. workforce. The \n     Chambliss-Kyl proposal is bad for both U.S. and immigrant \n     workers, bad for employers who want to employ a stable \n     workforce, and it is a dangerous precedent in immigration and \n     labor policy.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   William Samuel,\n                              Director, Department of Legislation.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this mentions:\n\n       The Chambliss-Kyl proposal would radically change the H-2A \n     program, stripping it of all labor protections and Government \n     oversight. This amendment would create a new year-round guest \n     worker program with no meaningful labor protections and no \n     role for the Department of Labor to enforce housing, pay, or \n     other essential worker protections.

The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 464\n\n  (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate on future requests for \n        funding for military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq)\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, from the moment our military first attacked \nOsama bin Laden's hideouts in Afghanistan, through the time that our \nfirst soldiers set foot inside Iraq, continuing right up until the \npresent day, the war in Afghanistan and the war in Iraq have been \nentirely funded by what the American people might call a series of \nstopgap spending measures. These measures, which are called emergency \nsupplemental appropriation bills in the parlance of our Nation's \ncapitol, take the form of last-minute requests by the White House for \nCongress to approve tens of billions of dollars on an accelerated \ntimetable.\n  From September 11, 2001, until today, Congress has approved $201 \nbillion in these appropriations bills, the great majority of which the \nPresident has applied to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. If this bill \non the Senate floor is approved, it will add another $79.3 billion to \nthat staggering total.\n  With the cost of the two wars approaching $280 billion--that is a lot \nof money; that is your money, Mr. and Mrs. American Citizen--the \nAmerican people are beginning to ask how much more will these two wars \ncost our country? The Congressional Budget Office estimated, in \nFebruary 2005, the cost of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan will cost \nthe American people $458 billion over the next 10 years. The $74.4 \nbillion in military spending contained in this supplemental \nappropriations bill is but a small downpayment on that staggering sum.\n  How accurate is this estimate of nearly half a trillion dollars more \nin war costs? How accurate is it? Amazingly, the administration has \nflatout refused to provide any estimates for the cost of the war in its \nannual budget request. That means, then, under the administration's \nbudget policies, our troops are forced to continue to rely on the \nstopgap spending measures that are known as emergency supplemental \nappropriations bills.\n  I know the terms ``supplemental request'' or ``emergency \nappropriations'' mean almost nothing to the average American. But each \ntime the White House sends a supplemental request to Congress for more \nfunds that have never appeared in the President's budget, it reminds me \nof the way so many Americans pull a credit card out of their wallet \nwhen faced with unexpected costs.\n  Like a credit card, emergency supplemental appropriations requests \ncan be responsibly used to cover costs that could not have been \nforeseen. But most Americans know, if someone starts using a credit \ncard for everyday expenses, watch out, because that person is on the \npath to financial ruin. Mr. President, I have never had a credit card \nin my life. I don't use one. My wife doesn't use one. Using that little \npiece of plastic means avoiding the tough choices and tradeoffs that \nare necessary for fiscal responsibility, while reckless spending and \nincreasing interest payments cause a family's debt to spiral out of \ncontrol. That, in a nutshell, is exactly what is happening in \nWashington, DC. Just like the slick advertising slogan for credit \ncards, the administration's repeated requests for supplemental \nappropriations for the war exemplify the phrase ``buy now, pay later.''\n  Over the last 3\\1/2\\ years, at a time when the Government is swimming \nin red ink, the White House has charged an additional $280 billion--\nthat is right, $280 billion--on the national credit card, without \nproposing a single dime of that spending in its annual budget proposal; \nnot one thin dime is seen or shown in the administration's annual \nbudget proposal. This is a reckless course the administration has \nplotted. It is fiscal irresponsibility at the highest level. This \n``take it as it comes'' approach to paying for the cost of the war in \nIraq ignores sound budgetary principles, and it is a grave disservice \nto our troops who are serving in Iraq.\n\n  By separating the regular budget of the Defense Department and other \nFederal agencies from the wartime costs of military operations, the \nWhite House has effectively denied Congress the ability to get the \nwhole picture of the needs of our troops and the other needs of our \nNation, such as education, highways, and veterans medical care. \nInstead, Congress receives only piecemeal information about, on the one \nhand, what funds are required to fight the war--this unnecessary war, I \nsay, in Iraq--and on the other, what funds are required for the regular \noperations of the Defense Department and other Federal agencies.\n  This is a misguided approach, and the net effect of this misguided \napproach is a thoroughly disjointed and discombobulated Federal budget. \nThis hand-me-down process does not serve our troops well.\n  A unified, coherent budget for our military would allow Congress and \nthe administration, as well as the American people, to focus on the \nfuture to evaluate what our troops might need to fight two wars--the \nwar in Afghanistan and the war in Iraq--in the next 6, 12, or 18 \nmonths.\n  I am fully supportive of the war in Afghanistan because in that case \nour country was attacked, our country was invaded by an enemy. We \nfought back. I fully supported President Bush in that war, and I do \ntoday. I support the troops in both wars, but I do not support the \npolicy that sent our troops into Iraq.\n  Instead of looking forward, however, the abuse of the supplemental \nappropriations process means the Congress and the administration are \nconstantly--constantly--looking backward over our shoulder to fix the \nproblems that might have been addressed had the cost of the wars been \nincluded in the President's budget.\n  Congress has had to add money to prior supplementals to buy more body \narmor, to buy more ammunition, to buy more armored humvees. All of \nthese costs should have been included in earlier administration regular \nunified budget requests for the entire Federal Government.\n  What is more, this disjointed manner of paying for the wars in Iraq \nand Afghanistan has a tremendous effect on the entire Federal budget. \nBy refusing to budget for the cost of the war, the President is \nsubmitting annual budgets to Congress that are downright inaccurate. \nThese budget requests are inaccurate. They understate the actual amount \nof our annual deficits by scores of billions of dollars.\n  If the President's emergency request for 2005 is approved, the \nCongress will have approved over $210 billion just for the war in Iraq. \nWhile the budget deficit grows to record levels, the President tells us \nwe have to cut domestic programs by $192 billion over the next 5 years. \nThe President tells us we have to charge veterans for their medical \ncare, that we have to cut grants for firefighters and first responders, \nthat we cannot adequately fund the No Child Left Behind Act, and that \nwe should cut funding for the National Institutes of Health. The list \ngoes on and on.\n  Since the President took office, he has taken a Federal budget that \nwas in\n\n[[Page S3787]]\n\nsurplus for 4 straight years and produced deficits as far as the human \neye can see. For 2006, the President is projecting a deficit of $390 \nbillion, but that deficit estimate does not--does not, does not--\ninclude new spending for the war in Iraq. We are not fighting that war \non the cheap. It is costing you money, you citizens out there. It is \nyour money; it is costing you money. That deficit estimate does not \ninclude new spending, I say, for the war in Iraq. Why? Why does it not? \nWhy does that deficit estimate not include new spending for the war in \nIraq? Because the President pretends he cannot project what the war \nwill cost in 2006. Well, Mr. President, I assure you the costs will not \nbe zero.\n  The President will not tell the American people what the war in Iraq \nwill cost. By understating the deficits, the American people are being \nled down a primrose path. That is dishonesty. Neither the White House \nnor Congress is making any tough choices about how to pay for the cost \nof the war because the administration is not telling Congress how much \nit thinks the war might cost in the next year. And as a result, there \nis no talk of raising taxes or cutting spending in order to pay for the \ncosts of the wars.\n  The United States is sinking deeper and deeper into debt, and the \nadministration's failure to budget for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan \nis sending our country even deeper into red ink. For as brilliantly as \nour troops have performed on the battlefield, as brilliantly as they \nhave fought and died on the battlefield, the administration's \nbudgeteers are creating a budgetary catastrophe. But the executive \nbranch has not always been so neglectful of the need to include in its \nbudget the cost of ongoing wars. According to the Congressional \nResearch Service, there is a long history of Presidents moving the cost \nof ongoing military operations into their annual budget requests rather \nthan relying completely on supplemental appropriations bills.\n  For example, the Congressional Research Service reports President \nFranklin D. Roosevelt included funds for World War II in his fiscal \nyear 1943 budget request. President Lyndon B. Johnson included funds \nfor the Vietnam war in his fiscal year 1966 request. Military \noperations in Bosnia and the U.S. operations to enforce the no-fly zone \nover Iraq were initially funded through supplemental appropriations. \nBut in 1995, Congress forced President Bill Clinton to include those \ncosts in his fiscal year 1997 budget, which he did. Upon assuming the \nPresidency, George W. Bush began to include the cost of the \npeacekeeping mission in Kosovo in his fiscal year 2001 budget request. \nI supported President Bush on that initiative because it made good \nfiscal sense. Twice I have offered amendments to the Defense \nappropriations bills to urge the President to add the costs of the wars \nin Iraq and Afghanistan to his budget.\n  These amendments were approved by strong bipartisan majorities of the \nSenate. The first time I offered the amendment on July 17, 2003, it was \napproved 81 to 15. The second time I offered the amendment on June 24, \n2004, it received even broader support and was approved 89 to 9. Each \ntime, this sense-of-the-Senate provision was included in the Defense \nAppropriations Act and signed into law by the President.\n  Today, I offer an amendment that follows up on the Senate's call for \nthe President to budget for the cost of the wars in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. Let us just have truth in accounting. This is honest \naccounting. We are letting the American people know how much they are \npaying for these wars.\n  This amendment builds on the sense-of-the-Senate language that has \nbeen approved by strong bipartisan majorities of the Senate in each of \nthe last 2 years. Once again, this provision urges the President to \nbudget for the cost of the war in Iraq and the war in Afghanistan. \nHowever, my amendment today goes further and urges the President to \nsubmit an amended budget request for the cost of the wars to Congress \nno later than September 1, 2005.\n  Although the White House should have budgeted for this war long ago, \nthis provision ratchets up the pressure on the administration to submit \nto Congress an estimate of the cost of the war for fiscal year 2006. \nHopefully, this will be the first step in restoring some sanity to the \nPresident's budget request that has so far ignored the enormous costs \nof military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  This amendment also contains a section of findings that illustrate \nmany of the points I have already made in urging the President to \nbudget for the war. These findings emphasize the legislative history of \nthe Senate urging the President to budget for the wars in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. The findings also present some of the conclusions reached \nby the Congressional Research Service about the funding of previous \nmilitary operations through the regular appropriations process.\n  Finally, this amendment includes a reporting requirement that would \nhelp keep Congress informed--help keep us informed. We are elected by \n``we the people,'' the first three words in the preamble of the \nConstitution. We are hearing a lot about the Constitution these days, \nand we are going to hear more. I am going to have a few things to say \nabout it before it is over.\n  As I said, this amendment includes a reporting requirement that would \nhelp to keep Congress informed about the real costs of the wars in Iraq \nand Afghanistan. This provision would require the Department of Defense \nto provide Congress with the specific amounts that have been spent to \ndate--what is wrong with that?--for each of the wars in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. Currently, the Pentagon prefers to report only a single \nfigure that combines the cost of these two wars, but Congress and the \nAmerican people ought to know the exact cost of the war in Afghanistan. \nThey ought to know the exact cost of the war that was forced upon our \ncountry in Afghanistan, and they need to know the cost of the war in \nIraq, the war that the administration chose to begin, the invasion that \nthe administration chose to set forth. These wars should not be \nconfused one with the other. They are two different wars, and we should \nsay so right up front. We should know the amount of money we spend in \neach.\n  In addition, this report would require the Pentagon to keep the \nCongress continually informed of estimates of military operations in \nIraq and in Afghanistan for the next year so that Congress can have the \nbetter lens with which to look upon future budgets for our military.\n  This is nothing but right. The elected representatives of the people \nsitting in this body ought to know these things. We are representing \nthe American people in our States and throughout the country. What is \nwrong with our telling them right up front? We need to know these \nthings. I have a responsibility to my people back home. Not only that, \nbut I have a responsibility to my children, my grandchildren, and to \ntheir children. Each of us has that responsibility, and we ought to ask \nfor this information. We ought to insist on it.\n  Once again, the Senate should send a message to the administration \nthat it ought to budget for the costs of the wars in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. My amendment sends that message in clear terms. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in approving this sense-of-the-Senate amendment \nwith another strong bipartisan vote.\n  I call up my amendment No. 464.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment will \nbe set aside. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 464.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 169, between lines 8 and 9, insert the following:\n\n\nrequests for future funding for military operations in afghanistan and \n                                  iraq\n\n       Sec. 1122. (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following \n     findings:\n       (1) The Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2004 \n     (Public Law 108-87) and the Department of Defense \n     Appropriations Act, 2005 (Public Law 108-287) each contain a \n     sense of the Senate provision urging the President to provide \n     in the annual budget requests of the President for a fiscal \n     year under section 1105(a) of title 31, United States Code, \n     an estimate of the cost of ongoing military operations in \n     Iraq and Afghanistan in such fiscal year.\n       (2) The budget for fiscal year 2006 submitted to Congress \n     by the President on February 7, 2005, requests no funds for \n     fiscal year\n\n[[Page S3788]]\n\n     2006 for ongoing military operations in Iraq or Afghanistan.\n       (3) According to the Congressional Research Service, there \n     exists historical precedent for including the cost of ongoing \n     military operations in the annual budget requests of the \n     President following initial funding for such operations by \n     emergency or supplemental appropriations Acts, including--\n       (A) funds for Operation Noble Eagle, beginning in the \n     budget request of President George W. Bush for fiscal year \n     2005;\n       (B) funds for operations in Kosovo, beginning in the budget \n     request of President George W. Bush for fiscal year 2001;\n       (C) funds for operations in Bosnia, beginning in budget \n     request of President Clinton for fiscal year 1997;\n       (D) funds for operations in Southwest Asia, beginning in \n     the budget request of President Clinton for fiscal year 1997;\n       (E) funds for operations in Vietnam, beginning in the \n     budget request of President Johnson for fiscal year 1966; and\n       (F) funds for World War II, beginning in the budget request \n     of President Roosevelt for fiscal year 1943.\n       (4) The Senate has included in its version of the fiscal \n     year 2006 budget resolution, which was adopted by the Senate \n     on March 17, 2005, a reserve fund of $50,000,000,000 for \n     overseas contingency operations, but the determination of \n     that amount could not take into account any Administration \n     estimate on the projected cost of such operations in fiscal \n     year 2006.\n       (5) In February 2005, the Congressional Budget Office \n     estimated that fiscal year 2006 costs for ongoing military \n     operations in Iraq and Afghanistan could total \n     $65,000,000,000.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) any request for funds for a fiscal year after fiscal \n     year 2006 for an ongoing military operation overseas, \n     including operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, should be \n     included in the annual budget of the President for such \n     fiscal year as submitted to Congress under section 1105(a) of \n     title 31, United States Code;\n       (2) the President should submit to Congress, not later than \n     September 1, 2005, an amendment to the budget of the \n     President for fiscal year 2006 that was submitted to Congress \n     under section 1105(a) of title 31, United States Code, \n     setting forth detailed cost estimates for ongoing military \n     operations overseas during such fiscal year; and\n       (3) any funds provided for a fiscal year for ongoing \n     military operations overseas should be provided in \n     appropriations Acts for such fiscal year through \n     appropriations to specific accounts set forth in such \n     appropriations Acts.\n       (c) Additional Requirements for Certain Reports.--(1) Each \n     semiannual report to Congress required under a provision of \n     law referred to in paragraph (2) shall include, in addition \n     to the matters specified in the applicable provision of law, \n     the following:\n       (A) A statement of the cumulative total of all amounts \n     obligated, and of all amounts expended, as of the date of \n     such report for Operation Enduring Freedom.\n       (B) A statement of the cumulative total of all amounts \n     obligated, and of all amounts expended, as of the date of \n     such report for Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n       (C) An estimate of the reasonably foreseeable costs for \n     ongoing military operations to be incurred during the 12-\n     month period beginning on the date of such report.\n       (2) The provisions of law referred to in this paragraph are \n     as follows:\n       (A) Section 1120 of the Emergency Supplemental \n     Appropriations Act for Defense and for the Reconstruction of \n     Iraq and Afghanistan, 2004 (Public Law 108-106; 117 Stat. \n     1219; 10 U.S.C. 113 note).\n       (B) Section 9010 of the Department of Defense \n     Appropriations Act, 2005 (Public Law 108-287; 118 Stat. 1008; \n     10 U.S.C. 113 note).\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise to speak about immigration and the \nissue that will be before us for two very important votes tomorrow. My \ncolleague from Alabama is also in the Chamber. I will take the allotted \ntime under the unanimous consent, and then I think he wants to spend \nmore time on these issues.\n  What I find very fascinating is that everyone who has come to the \nSenate floor this afternoon to talk about immigration agrees that our \ncountry is in near crisis at this moment for our inability to control \nour borders, to stem the tide of illegal movement into our country, and \nto fashion comprehensive or targeted immigration law that effectively \nworks. Simply put, our Federal Government has to do better. It has to \nmove faster in improving our border security and meeting this \nphenomenally large and important issue of illegal immigration.\n  Congress is no further along today on a comprehensive bill than it \nwas a year ago at this time when my bill, the AgJOBS bill, had a \nthorough hearing before the Judiciary Committee. It is now well over \n1,300 days since we woke up after 9/11 with thousands of our country \nmen and women dead and a phenomenal frightening awakening on the part \nof the American people that there were millions of undocumented foreign \nnationals living in our country.\n  As I said earlier, while most of them are law-abiding, are here to \nwork, and are extremely hard-working people, we found out tragically \nenough that there were some here with evil intent, and we began to \ncontrol our borders. I think that is why Congress then again started \nbeefing up border patrol and buying high-tech verification systems for \nthe Department of Homeland Security, and that is why, whether one \nagrees on the specific methods or not, the House of Representatives \njust attached to the legislation we are talking about this afternoon a \nnational driver's license standard and asylum changes, those seeking \nasylum in our country, in the so-called REAL ID provisions to the Iraq \nsupplemental. That is why I have supported a Byrd amendment on this \nbill to take money away from certain portions of this bill that are not \nimmediately necessary for our troops for their security and allow our \nborder security to hire more investigators and enforcement agents to \nboost up that whole area we are so concerned about.\n  That is why I am cosponsoring a bill that helps States deal with \nundocumented criminal aliens. We must get it right everywhere if we are \ngoing to reinstate in our country secure borders and functional \nimmigration law. That is why I have worked for the last good number of \nyears on AgJOBS. We talk about it here today. What does it mean? It \nmeans Agricultural Job Opportunities, Benefits and Security Act. That \nis why we are on the floor of the Senate today.\n  Some would argue we ought to be doing the Iraqi supplemental because \nit is urgent. None of this money is immediately necessary in Iraq. The \nHouse took 2 months to craft it. We are going to take a few days to \npass it. But I must tell you as I have before, I believe the crisis in \nimmigration today is every bit as significant. No matter the money we \npour along the borders, still our borders are not under control, \nespecially our southern border.\n  Senator Kennedy came to the floor a few moments ago to give a very \ncomprehensive analysis of how he and I, and now over 500 groups, have \ncome together to try to resolve the issue of immigration, specific to \nAmerican agriculture. Those are the issues at hand at this moment. We \nare not in any way obstructing the process. This afternoon could have \nbeen filled with amendments on the supplemental if those who have \namendments would have been here to offer them. We are simply taking \ntime in the debate. We will have those votes tomorrow. If Senators \nSaxby Chambliss and Jon Kyl do not get the necessary 60 votes, or I do \nnot on these issues, they will be set aside. But they will not go away, \nbecause I do believe, as I think most Americans believe, somehow we \nhave to get this right. Somehow it is necessary to do so.\n  I am committed to making this debate as brief as possible. That is \nwhy I agreed to a unanimous consent request to conform it and to shape \nit, but to allow a full and fair and necessary debate. As far as I am \nconcerned, a thorough debate on AgJOBS does not need to take a multiple \nof days or months. Every Senator knows this issue. Every Senator knows \nhis and her constituents are upset at this moment because somehow \nCongress has failed to deal with this issue. I have received my fair \nshare of criticism from some of my constituents for offering AgJOBS. I \nsmiled and said: You sent me to work in Washington to solve a problem. \nI brought the solution to that problem. I believe it is the right one. \nNo one else, except for those this afternoon, has brought a second \nsolution. I welcome all Senators to get involved in this debate and \nunderstand the issues. But most importantly, we cannot do what past \nCongresses have done or what we have done for the over 1,300 days since \n9/11, look over our shoulder and say: Oh, boy, that is a big problem; \nand, oh, boy, our borders are at risk and, yes, some of those illegals \ncould be here to do us harm, but we can't seem to get our hands around \nit because it is such a complicated issue.\n  I do not dispute its complications. But I am frustrated that the \nSenate and the House have literally not been able to act. I believe the \nSenate has had enough time. As I mentioned earlier, we have seen this \nbill when it was\n\n[[Page S3789]]\n\nbefore the Judiciary Committee. I think most of my colleagues know \nabout AgJOBS. Yes, 63 Senators supported it last year. We are now \nnearly at 50 at this time. Clearly a large number do support it. I \nthink that is extremely important that we do. It is so necessary that \nwe move appropriately to solve this problem and solve it in a timely \nfashion. This now gives us an opportunity to do that.\n  As I said to my colleagues, I have worked on this issue with numerous \ncommunities of interest for nearly 5 years to craft what we believe is \none of the best approaches to solving the problem, not only recognizing \nthat illegals, the undocumented are a problem in our country, but once \nthey are here, and if they are here illegally, how do we treat them? \nHow does the agricultural economy provide for them and respond to them \nwhile they are so necessary in that workforce? That is what is embodied \nin AgJOBS. It is not simply a threshold of how you transition through. \nIt is in reality a major reform of the H-2A program.\n  Let's continue with this issue. I am going to stop at this moment. My \ncolleague Senator Sessions is on the floor. I need to step away a few \nmoments. I know he has important things to say--many that I agree with, \nbut there are some I do not agree with.\n  Don't kick this ball down the field to another day. We look now at a \ncomprehensive piece of legislation. It is very necessary we attempt to \nsolve it now, get this Congress involved, and tell the American people \nwe hear them, we know our national security is at risk, and in this \ninstance our food security is at risk. We need to solve a very \nimportant problem.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Idaho. Senator \nCraig is one of my favorite Members of the Senate. We agree on many \nthings. We have not agreed on this one.\n  Yes, I think we all understand we are dealing with a broad, \nimportant, and complex issue. It does require us to give it some \nthought. But the point of the matter is we are being asked to vote on \nAgJOBS tomorrow. People are going to have to cast a vote on this bill. \nI urge you not to vote for this legislation, because it should not be \non the Defense supplemental and, second, because it is flawed, \nseriously flawed. It is not consistent with what I think are the views \nof most Members of Congress or the American people on how we ought to \nhandle this matter.\n\n  I mentioned briefly earlier how the process toward amnesty works in \nthis legislation. I would like to refer to this chart. I think it makes \nthe point rather simply. I do not think it is disputed.\n  You have people who came here illegally. Perhaps they are in the \ncountry, perhaps they have already gone back to their home country, but \nthey have violated our law by coming here, both in coming here and in \nworking illegally for some firm or company.\n  If they have done that and if, within 18 months of December 31 of \nlast year, 2004, they have worked 100 workdays--and they have defined a \nworkday in the act as 1 hour, so that could be 100 hours of work--they \nearn what the proponents of this legislation say they are earning: \ntheir right to be here.\n  They are being paid for this, presumably. They didn't come here to \nwork for not being paid. They came for a salary they are willing to \naccept. They work here for 100 hours. Then they become a lawful, \ntemporary resident. Then all of a sudden someone who was here \nunlawfully is now converted to a lawful resident.\n  A number of things occur after that. If they have family here, a \nspouse or children--one, two, three, four, five, six--and that spouse \nor those children may have been here 6 weeks, the spouse and children \nare entitled to stay as long as the person who now has become a lawful, \ntemporary resident; and within the next 6 years, if that person is \nemployed in agriculture for 2,060 hours--the average worker works about \n2000 hours a year, so that would be about 1 year out of 6, being paid \nfor this--they have therefore earned legal permanent resident status. \nThat is pretty significant, legal permanent residency, because if you \nbecome a legal permanent resident, then you are no longer an indentured \nservant. You are not required to work in agriculture. You can work on \nany job you want.\n  It might be this court reporting job right here.\n  I don't know what they want to work on. They became a legal, \npermanent resident. They can wait for 5 years, and then they are \nvirtually guaranteed a citizenship unless they are convicted--charged, \nconvicted--of a felony or convicted of three misdemeanors. A \nmisdemeanor can be a pretty serious offense sometimes.\n  I am not sure we want somebody to want to come here to commit a bunch \nof misdemeanors. You don't usually get caught for all of them. People \ndo things and half the time they do not get caught at all. If you catch \na victim twice on a misdemeanor, that can be very serious.\n  Then they are given citizenship.\n  By the way, if their children are not here, have never been here, and \nthey became a lawful, permanent resident, they can send for them--one, \ntwo, or five members. They can come on down and be a part of the United \nStates and be on the road to citizenship, even though maybe that was \nnever the intention. Maybe it was never the intention, to begin with, \nfor their family to come here.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Yes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. The Senator is making a very interesting point. Has the \nSenator looked at the Bureau of Labor Statistics' numbers of those they \nbelieve--if the law were passed--are AgJOBS eligible?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. About a million.\n  Mr. CRAIG. About 500,000 is what they estimate. When you do all of \nthe very thorough background checks we have within it that are \nconsistent with immigration law today, they figure a certain number \nwould fall out, and then there are the wives and dependents. A very \nlarge number of these are not married. They have no immediate family--\nabout 200,000 more. It is reasonable to say the Department of Labor is \nlooking at a total number of workers, spouse, and dependents of upwards \nof possibly 700,000. I know millions and millions are talked about. I \nbelieve that is unrealistic based on the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n  Does the Senator disagree with those figures?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will say it this way: I will say it is very likely to \nbe a million.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Based on what figures?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Close to a million, if you take the figure of 700,000. \nI am not sure we have thought it through.\n  The Senator, I believe--who was here in 1987 when the 1986 amnesty \nwas passed--would admit that the estimate of how many people would take \nadvantage of it was very low. In fact, I believe three times as many \npeople took advantage of that amnesty as the estimators estimated. It \ncould happen here. I don't know.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I don't disagree with that. But the criteria was entirely \ndifferent. If I could be so kind, I think my colleague is mixing apples \nand oranges and getting an interesting blend of a new juice. An earned \nstatus approach has never been used before. The full background check, \nand the thoroughness of that background check as we anticipate in this \nlegislation, is only used when you have a legal immigrant standing in \nline. In fact, our law is more stringent for illegal than it is for the \nlegal immigrant because they can get the misdemeanors. We say, if you \nget a misdemeanor with 6 months' incarceration, that is pretty serious. \nThe Senator from Alabama is an attorney. Would he agree with that? They \nare out of here. There is a much different criteria when you start \ncomparing the total numbers. That is why I think they would be \ndifferent.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The act says three convictions of misdemeanors. The \nSenator is right. It can be up to 6 months or a year.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Then they are deported.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Not if there are two convictions.\n  Mr. CRAIG. That is correct. That is the current law. That is what \ncurrent law says for the illegal immigrant.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. It is in the legislation.\n  Mr. CRAIG. It is in the law.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. For those here illegally and want amnesty to be given \neven though they have already violated immigration laws.\n\n[[Page S3790]]\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank my colleague for yielding. What is important is \nthe bill be read very thoroughly. Extrapolations can be made. But when \nit says 100 hours of work, I think it is important to assume you would \nonly work 1 hour a day for 100 days. That is not a very logical \nprocess.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I agree with the Senator on that. I will disagree with \nthe concept that somehow, by working here, coming here, and getting a \njob you wanted to get when you came, that that is somehow earning \nsomething, if you did it illegally. You are getting what you wanted, \nwhich was pay for the work.\n  That is what I would point out. Then, a family would be automatically \neligible to come into the country. I don't think there is any dispute \nabout that.\n\n  If a person came here illegally, if they worked here 18 months and \nmet those qualifications of 100 workdays, or 565 hours, I believe--\neither way, it is not very much--they can come even though they are not \nhere now. In other words, if they did that illegally, worked here and \nfor some reason went back home, then they are getting a letter from \nUncle Sam saying, By the way, we know you violated our law but we are \nin a forgiving mood. You can come on back and join the process toward \ncitizenship and bring your family, too.\n  I am not sure that is what we want to do. I don't think it is what we \nwant to do. That is the fundamental of this legislation.\n  I think that is what you call amnesty. Not only does it give the \nperson what they wanted in terms of being able to come into the country \nand get a job and be paid, that puts them on a track--unless they get \nseriously conflicted with the law--to be a permanent resident and then \neven a citizen, and their children and family can be on that same \ntrack.\n  That is a big deal. That is what I am saying. It is not something we \nneed to be rushing into on this legislation today.\n  Under section 101(d)(8), entitled ``Eligibility for Legal Services,'' \nit is required under the act that free, federally funded legal counsel \nbe afforded, through the Legal Services Corporation, to assist \ntemporary workers in the application process for adjustment to lawful \npermanent resident status.\n  American workers are not always available for that. They have to meet \nother standards such as need and that sort of thing.\n  Also, the act gives several advantages to foreign workers not \nprovided to American workers. Look at this.\n  Section 101(b), rights of aliens granted temporary resident status.\n  Right here--temporary resident status.\n  Terms of employment respecting aliens admitted under this section, A, \nprohibition.\n  Quoting:\n\n       No alien granted temporary resident status under subsection \n     A may be terminated from employment by any employer during \n     the period of temporary resident status except for just \n     cause.\n\n  Then they set up a big process for this. There is a complaint \nprocess. The subsection sets out a process for filing complaints for \ntermination without just cause. If reasonable cause exists, the \nSecretary shall initiate binding arbitration proceedings and pay the \nfee and expenses of the arbitrator. Attorneys' fees will be the \nresponsibility of each party. The complaint process does not preclude \n``any other rights an employee may have under applicable law.''\n  That means they could file under this process for unjust termination \nand hire a plaintiffs lawyer and sue the business for whatever else you \nwant to sue them for.\n\n       Any fact or finding made by the arbitrator shall not be \n     conclusive or binding in any separate action--\n\n  That is the action filed in the court by plaintiffs' lawyer--\n\n       or subsequent action or proceeding between the employee and \n     the employer.\n\n  I submit to you, by the language of this statute, it would appear \nthey intend for that to be admissible, if not binding. It says not \nbinding but the implication would be it would be admissible.\n  This means an employer cannot allow that arbitration proceeding to go \nwithout an attorney. He will have to hire an attorney and go down there \nbecause things will go wrong and that will be used against him in any \ncivil action that might take place. They have to pay counsel in both \nplaces.\n  This section will override State laws in America. In Alabama, unless \nyou enter into a contract that states otherwise for employment, your \nwork for an employer is at will. Contracts of employment at will mean \njust that: it is the will of either party. Employees can quit at will \nand employers can terminate at will, with cause or without cause, and \nfor no reason, good or bad reason.\n  That is the way I think it is in most States. Certainly that is true \nin my State. This provision will mean illegal aliens who file for \namnesty under the AgJOBs amendment, after coming here illegally in \nviolation of our law, are guaranteed to have a job unless they are \nterminated for just cause. If the AgJOBS amendment passes, employers of \naliens given amnesty will be subject to forced and binding arbitration \nregarding the termination of the alien, and they will have to cover \ntheir legal bills for the defense in arbitrations even if the \narbitrator finds they had just cause to terminate the alien.\n  I suggest what we are about here is a provision for greater \nprotection for a foreign worker, one not only who is foreign but who \npreviously violated American law. If you were an employer and you need \nto lay off one person, and you have two working for you, and one would \nhave the ability to take you through arbitration and argue that you did \nnot have just cause, and the other one had no such rights, you might \nfire the American citizen first, not the foreigner.\n  There is another provision I will talk about later that deals with \nthe filing of the application. The Senator says they will be doing \nbackground checks. I see nothing in here that provides for background \nchecks. It requires an application to be filed to become a temporary \nresident. Get this: It can be filed with two groups who are called \n``qualified designated entities.'' That can be an employer group who \nwants workers to come here to work for them, or a labor group. And they \nare qualified entities. The application is filed with them.\n  It prohibits giving the application to the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity unless a lawyer has read it first. It says the entities that \nreceive this application cannot give it to the Secretary unless they \nare conducting a fraud investigation. How would they know to conduct \none if they haven't seen the documents? It might be fraudulent.\n  It is a rather weird idea, is antigovernment, and seems to be far \nmore concerned with protecting an applicant who may be committing fraud \nthan protecting the security and the laws of the United States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I would like to express my opposition \nto the AgJOBS bill as it is currently drafted.\n  This is a very complicated bill. It is a magnet for illegal \nimmigration. It has not been reviewed by the Judiciary Committee. We do \nnot know how many people would be affected by it.\n  Rather, it has come to the floor as an amendment to the supplemental \nappropriations bill.\n  This is not the place for this bill. I believe it is a mistake to \npass this bill on an emergency supplemental that is designed to provide \nhelp for our military, fighting in extraordinary circumstances.\n  That is why I cosponsored an amendment with Senator Cornyn saying \nthat the place to do these amendments is through the regular order, \nbeginning in the Immigration Subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee. \nThis amendment passed by a vote of 61 to 38.\n  And that is why I will vote against cloture on the AgJOBS bill and on \nthe other complicated immigration amendment, the Chambliss-Kyl \namendment.\n  If, however, cloture is invoked, then I plan on offering several \namendments that I believe will improve the bill.\n  If these amendments are approved by the full body, or are later \nincorporated into the bill through an appropriate Judiciary Committee \nmarkup, then I would be prepared to support the bill.\n  But otherwise, it is my intention to vote against the bill. I simply \ncannot support the bill in good conscience as it is.\n  I believe the bill as drafted is a huge magnet. The Judiciary \nCommittee has\n\n[[Page S3791]]\n\nnot had a chance to review it, amend it, mark it up. And it does not \nbelong on a supplemental appropriations bill.\n  We know that people come to this country illegally.\n  They come for many different reasons. Some out of fear of \npersecution, some for work, all for opportunity.\n  In 2000, it was estimated that there were 7 million unauthorized \naliens in this country. And by 2002, this number had grown to 9.3 \nmillion. These are Census numbers reported in the CRS Report on \nImmigration, updated 4/08/05.\n  In agriculture, approximately 1.25 million, or about 50 percent of \nthe agricultural work force, are illegal workers--600,000 of whom live \nand work in California. These numbers are from the Department of Labor.\n  Many of these workers have been here for years, have worked hard, \nbrought their families here, and have built their lives here.\n  With respect to agricultural work, I know that it is extraordinarily \ndifficult, if not impossible, to get Americans to work in agricultural \nlabor.\n  I did not believe it. Several years ago we contacted every welfare \noffice in the State. And every welfare office in the State told us that \nonce they put a sign up, no one responded.\n  So I think it is the right thing to do to give the workers who have \nbeen here for a substantial period of time, who have been working in \nagriculture, who have been good members of society, and who will \ncontinue to work in agriculture, a way to adjust their status.\n  What I do not support is creating a magnet that draws large \nadditional numbers of illegal immigration. Not only would this have a \ndetrimental effect on our society, but it would harm the people we are \ntrying to help through this bill.\n  Here is why: An influx in illegal immigrants would flood the labor \nmarket, make jobs more difficult to find, and drive down wages.\n  For those of you who doubt the magnet effect, you have only to \nexamine what happened when President Bush announced his guest worker \nproposal early last year.\n  Despite the fact that the President's proposal had no path to \nlegalization, the mere announcement of the proposal fueled a rush along \nthe Southwest border.\n  The Los Angeles Time on May 16, 2004, reported: ``detentions of \nillegal immigrants along the border . . . have risen 30% over the first \nseven months of the fiscal year, a period that includes the four months \nsince Bush announced his plan.''\n  Similarly, the San Diego Union Tribune on January 27, 2004, reported: \n``U.S. Border Patrol officials report a 15 percent increase in the use \nof fraudulent documents at the world's busiest land border crossing \n[San Ysidro]. And more than half of those caught using phony documents \nsay the president's offer of de facto amnesty motivated them to attempt \nto sneak into the United States.''\n  Does anyone doubt that this increase was related to anything but the \nPresident's proposal? Of course not.\n  When I raised the concern with the authors of the legislation, that \nthis legislation would be a magnet that would attract large numbers, \nthey seemed to believe that the fact that the bill only applies to \nthose who were in this country and working in agriculture as of \nDecember 31, 2004, would be sufficient to deter people from illegal \nentry.\n  I do not believe that is the case. I think people will see that they \nonly need 100 days of work to qualify for temporary residence; they \nwill not be deterred by the operative date, and will say, ``I'll find a \njob, work 100 days, and then I'm legal and can bring my family.''\n  The first two of these amendments I would like to offer would \nincrease the time someone must demonstrate he or she has been in the \nUnited States working in agriculture in order to qualify for temporary \nand permanent residence.\n  This would discourage others from coming to this country, and help \nthose who have been here for many years.\n  Here is what the first amendment would do. In order to qualify for \ntemporary residence, workers would have to demonstrate that they have \nworked for at least three years in agricultural work prior to December \n31, 2004.\n  For each of the 3 years, the worker would be required to show 100 \nwork-days, or 575 hours, per year in agriculture.\n  Here is what the second amendment would do. In order to qualify for \npermanent residence, a green card, workers would have to show that they \nhave worked at least 5 years in agricultural work following enactment \nof the bill. For each of the five years, the worker would again have to \ndemonstrate 100 work-days, or 575 hours, per year.\n  So by extending the length of time a worker needs to have worked both \nin the past and the future, these amendments reduce the incentives for \nmore illegal immigration.\n  The next amendment addresses another major concern that I have.\n  The bill currently allows someone with one or two misdemeanor \ncriminal convictions in the United States to apply for temporary \nresidence or a green card. I think this is a mistake.\n  So the amendment I am offering strikes this language and ensures that \nthose with criminal records do not qualify for benefits--if they have \neven one criminal conviction in the United States, or anywhere.\n\n  I believe that no one who has a criminal conviction should be the \nrecipient of temporary residence or a green card under this program.\n  Misdemeanors include petty theft, simple assault against persons, \ndriving under the influence, certain drug offenses, and misdemeanor \nbattery.\n  In some States, they include cases of child abuse or domestic abuse, \npublic assistance fraud, or abandonment of a child under the age of 10.\n  I do not believe we should allow anyone to apply for a benefit as \nsignificant as a green card under this bill if they have committed any \ncrime, let alone the two misdemeanors that the bill currently allows.\n  The final amendment I am offering would prohibit workers who are \nliving outside the United States from applying for temporary residence \nunder this bill.\n  The bill allows those living in other countries to apply for benefits \nunder this bill--as long as they can demonstrate the appropriate time \nspent in agricultural work in the United States prior to their \ndeparture from this country.\n  This means that someone could come to the United States illegally, \nwork here illegally, return to their home country, and still apply for \na green card under this bill. This simply makes no sense.\n  If we are going to give agricultural workers a way to adjust their \nstatus, let us limit it to those who are living and working in this \ncountry.\n  California is the No. 1 agriculture-producing State in the Nation.\n  I recognize that this status is based on the hard work of people who \nhave been living on the edges of our society, living in fear, and \nconstantly worried about being removed from this country.\n  It is time for the Government to recognize that these people have \nmade a substantial contribution to our country and offer them a way to \nadjust their status.\n  Remember, there are already 1.25 million agricultural workers here \nillegally, 600,000 in California.\n  These amendments would concentrate on their adjustment of status, \nthereby moving the workers and their families from the shadows and \nallowing them temporary, and subsequently, permanent legal status.\n  But I think that we have to be careful in how we proceed--if we do it \nthe right way, we can help those who have been working in agriculture \nfor many years and who have been good, upstanding members of society.\n  These are the people we should be trying to help: They have children, \nmany of whom are born here and are U.S. citizens. They have paid taxes. \nSome have bought homes. They have worked hard for everything they have \ngotten. They have been good, productive members of society.\n  But if we do it the wrong way--we will actually cause great harm to \nthe agriculture workers who have been here for years--we will create a \nmagnet, flooding the borders, pushing down wages, and making it more \ndifficult to find work.\n  These are simple, commonsense amendments.\n  As I said before, I would have preferred to do this in committee \nwhere we could have the time necessary to consider such complicated \nlegislation.\n\n[[Page S3792]]\n\n  But if we are to pass an agricultural workers bill, let it be one \nthat helps those who have contributed to our society and one that will \nnot cause great harm to our Nation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I was looking on our desks at the bill \nthat is actually supposed to be the subject of this debate. It is 231 \npages long. It provides an emergency appropriation to help pay for our \nongoing global war on terror. I remind my colleagues that is the stated \npurpose for this Senate time.\n  Indeed, last week 60 of my colleagues joined me in saying that \nnational security demands the passage of this bill unencumbered by a \npremature debate on immigration reform.\n  Listening to our colleague from Alabama and others who have spoken to \nthis subject, we are getting a better sense of how complicated this \nissue is and why it is so important, as 61 of us said last week, that \nwe proceed with this emergency appropriation for the ongoing global war \non terror and reserve enactment of comprehensive immigration reform for \na few months hence, after we have had a chance to go through the \nappropriate committees of the Congress, the Subcommittee on \nImmigration, Border Security, and Citizenship that I chair in the \nJudiciary Committee. Chairman Specter of the full committee has \npromised an expedited markup once we are able to go through the regular \norder and develop a comprehensive plan.\n  Notwithstanding the sense of the Senate by 61 Members that we should \nnot engage in this premature debate and risk bogging down this \nimportant bill to provide financing to our troops in the battlefield, \nhere we are.\n  What is it that the problem of this bill, the so-called AgJOBS \namendment, seeks to fix? I suggest it does not purport to fix our \nporous borders. It does nothing to provide additional resources to our \nbeleaguered Border Patrol and others who are doing the very best they \ncan to try to secure our borders. We know not only do people come \nacross those borders to work, but the same people who will smuggle \nthose workers across the border are the same people who can smuggle \nterrorists or criminals or others who want to do us ill across those \nborders. So AgJOBS, just so everyone understands, does not purport to \ndeal with that problem.\n  Does this bill purport to deal with another glaring deficiency we \nhave; that is, a lack of detention facilities for those people our \nBorder Patrol do catch and detain at the border so we do not have to \ncontinue in what is sometimes called a catch and release program where \ndetainees, people who cross illegally are detained but because we do \nnot have adequate facilities are released and they merely try again, \nand perhaps try and try and try until they finally make their way \nacross the border and into the interior of the United States and simply \nmelt into the landscape? This bill does not have anything to do with \nthat. It will not fix that problem. Nor does this bill provide \nadditional resources and equipment to our Border Patrol who, as I \nindicate, are outmanned and underequipped.\n  This AgJOBS amendment, nor the alternative offered by Senator \nChambliss and Senator Kyl, does not purport to deal with the problem of \n40 percent of the illegal immigration in this country coming from \noverstays. By that I mean people who come here legally on a student \nvisa or a tourist visa or some other short-term legal authorization but \nsimply blow past that deadline and, here again, become part of that \npopulation estimated to be somewhere on the order of 10 million \npeople--although we really do not know--who are currently living in the \nUnited States outside of our laws. This bill does not purport to even \naddress that.\n  It does not do a better job of helping identify who is in our country \nand why they are here, why they chose to come outside of our laws and \nlive in the shadows. It does not help us do a better job of identifying \nthem and asserting what their purposes are in our country--whether they \nare criminals, whether they are potential terrorists, or whether they \nare people coming here simply to work.\n  This AgJOBS bill also does not deal with the difficulty involved with \nemployers who want to try to ascertain the legal status of their \nworkforce. It does not help them by providing them a database of \nworkers who are lawfully in the country and who are authorized to \naccept employment. So employers have to persist in doing the best they \ncan in trying to fill the jobs that go wanting for lack of workers by \nhiring people they perhaps do not know but would have to admit, perhaps \nin private conversations, are people who are here illegally outside of \nour laws. This bill does not help them one bit. This bill does not \nprovide a database of workers who are actually authorized to work and \nwho are legally present in the country.\n  My point is, there are a lot of problems that confront our national \nsecurity, a lot of problems that confront our immigration system that \nneed to be addressed that are not addressed in this legislation. To the \ncontrary, rather than trying to address immigration reform \ncomprehensively, rather than trying to improve our border security, our \nhomeland security, by knowing who is in our country and why, rather \nthan providing us a better means of identifying those who, although \nthey begin in this country legally, overstay their time and become part \nof the population that is here illegally, rather than help employers, \nthis bill does none of that. Instead, what it does is it deals with one \nsegment of the industry that has grown to depend on undocumented \nworkers, and that is the agriculture industry.\n  While I am sympathetic to their concerns, the problem is that it is \nonly one of the industries that relies on undocumented workers. You \ncould as easily file a bill and rather than call it an AgJOBS bill, you \ncould call it a restaurant workers bill, or a residential construction \nworkers bill, or a hotel workers bill, or any one of the number of \ndifferent industries that has, over time, grown to depend on \napproximately 6 million people who constitute the illegal workforce \ncurrently in the United States.\n  This bill does not purport to deal with any of those other industries \nand thus chooses one over the other in a way that I think violates one \nof the fundamental principles of American law, and that is that persons \nsimilarly situated ought to be treated as equally as possible and not \nin any favorable or discriminatory fashion.\n  So I think this bill, as premature as it is, as well intended as it \nmay be, does not help us solve a lot of the problems that can only be \naddressed by comprehensive immigration reform. It actually does harm by \nviolating some of our basic principles of equal justice under the law. \nIt is important we deal with these problems.\n  I failed to mention one of the problems is we have approximately \n400,000 absconders present in the country now and we simply do not have \nthe adequate human or other resources necessary to find out where they \nare and to show them the way out of the country. Among these \nabsconders, unlike the rest of the population I mentioned, the some 10 \nmillion people, are individuals who have been convicted of serious \ncrimes, about 80,000 of them, and who simply have melted into the \nlandscape. As I say, we have about 400,000 absconders, including those \n80,000, the difference being those who have simply exhausted all means \nof appeal and review in our immigration system, who are under final \norders of deportation, but who, rather than be deported, have simply \ngone underground. Here again, this is another issue this bill does not \ndeal with that comprehensive immigration reform would and that we \nshould.\n  What I fear will happen, because it may be tempting to try to fix our \nimmigration problems on a piecemeal basis, is piecemeal solutions and \nefforts will risk undermining the larger effort and the need to enact \ncomprehensive reform. Indeed, I would venture a guess that if the \nAgJOBS bill were successful, or even if the alternative offered by the \nSenator from Georgia and the Senator from Arizona were to be \nsuccessful, there would be many in this Chamber, and perhaps around \nthis country, who would say: OK, now we have finished that job. We do \nnot need to look at any further immigration reform.\n  The only problem with that is they would be wrong, given the glaring \nproblems that do exist in our country and the challenges to our \nnational security and our ability to look ourselves in the mirror and \nsay, yes, we are a nation of laws, when, in fact, we have such \nlawlessness existing among us for any one\n\n[[Page S3793]]\n\nof us to see, if we take the time to look at it.\n  Well, besides dealing with one industry, the AgJOBS bill also has \nsome very troublesome provisions which I think undermine its claimed \nstatus as a temporary worker provision. Indeed, an estimated 860,000 \nillegal alien agricultural workers could qualify, and it also permits \nthem to bring their spouses and children, which could bring the total \nnumber of AgJOBS beneficiaries to as many as 3 million people.\n  Now, the interesting thing about that is it does not stop at the \npeople who are already here who came into the country in violation of \nour laws. Another startling provision of this bill actually invites \nback to the United States certain aliens who were here illegally and \nwho performed the requisite 100 hours of agricultural work between July \n2003 and December 2004 but who have already left. These aliens would be \nallowed, under this AgJOBS bill, to drop off a ``preliminary \napplication'' at a designated port of entry along the southern land \nborder, pick up a work permit, and reenter the United States.\n\n  So not only are we dealing with people who are here now but people \nwho were here illegally and who have left. We are now saying: Come on \nback and pick up a work permit and reenter this pathway toward full \nAmerican citizenship ahead of all of the other people who are playing \nby the rules and waiting in line. That is wrong.\n  Another provision of this bill which I have some concerns about is \nentitled ``Eligibility for Legal Services,'' which requires free, \nfederally funded legal counsel be afforded--that is, paid for--by \nAmerican taxpayer dollars through the Legal Services Corporation to \nassist temporary workers in the application process for legal permanent \nresidency.\n  Not only does this bill deal with a specific industry and ignore the \nrest of the industries that have come to rely, in significant part, on \nundocumented workers, this invites into our country the spouses and \nchildren of these workers--a total of some 3 million people \npotentially. And these workers, of course, will not be here temporarily \nif they are essentially setting up home in the United States.\n  There is a difference between an approach that says we will set up a \nframework for people to come and work but then return to their country, \nwhich is truly a temporary worker program, and one such as this which \nsays, don't just work and return, but work and stay and break in ahead \nof the line of all the other people who have applied to come to this \ncountry legally, even though you have chosen to do so otherwise. Beyond \nthat, we are going to provide you with a free lawyer.\n  I think it is not a stretch to say the AgJOBS bill will invite even \nmore lawsuits since it expands the ability of the Legal Services \nCorporation to sue growers in several areas.\n  The reasons the current provisions of the law which deal with \nagricultural workers have been unsuccessful are, No. 1, because the \ncaps are set too low and, No. 2, because it has become so bureaucratic \nand burdened by regulation that it basically is not a viable \nalternative for the agricultural industry, and growers have come to \nexpect excessive litigation as a result, which this AgJOBS bill would \ndo nothing to fix but would aggravate.\n  Let me speak briefly about the bill Senators Kyl and Chambliss have \noffered today. It does compare favorably with some of the provisions in \nthe AgJOBS bill because it does not provide for amnesty. It does not \nprovide a path to U.S. citizenship automatically ahead of all of the \nother people who have played by the rules and who have applied in the \nregular course of our laws. It has many of the same failings I \nmentioned earlier about being a partial solution to a real and \ncomprehensive problem.\n  I hope my colleagues will recall the vote they cast just last week, \nwhen 61 of us voted on a sense of the Senate to say that this \nappropriations bill, providing emergency funds for the warfighters, the \npeople risking their very lives to defend us in the global war on \nterrorism, ought to take the front seat and that we ought to reserve \ncomprehensive immigration reform to a later date and not slow this bill \ndown because of that.\n  Having not resisted the temptation to get embroiled in an immigration \ndebate, I hope our colleagues will listen carefully to the half \nsolutions and the special interest legislation this represents. I don't \nbegrudge employers who need workers from trying to find a legal \nsolution to that. I am for doing that but on a comprehensive basis, not \njust an industry-specific basis and particularly not on a basis that \nprovides additional benefits to these workers in the form of amnesty \nthat they would not otherwise be entitled to and denies other people \nequal opportunity to participate in a temporary worker program.\n  As complicated as this issue is and as important as the debate is, \nnow is not the time to be engaging in it. Certainly now is not the time \nto pass a partial solution which will undermine our ability to get \ncomprehensive immigration reform done.\n  It is my distinct impression that there is a big difference between \nthe thinking on the part of the advocates of the AgJOBS bill in this \nChamber and our colleagues on the other side of the Capitol. \nRealistically, as part of this emergency appropriations bill, to get \nthe warfighters what they need in order to do the job we have asked \nthem to do and which they volunteered to do, I cannot see the other \nChamber agreeing to this ill-considered and premature immigration \nlegislation at this time.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against both the AgJOBS bill, to vote \nagainst the alternative offered by the Senators from Georgia and \nArizona, but at the same time to say, you are more than welcome, as we \nwork together for comprehensive reform, to work with us. We will try to \nmeet you halfway in working out a consensus on this very tough and \ncomplex but important issue that should not be handled in the way they \nhave proposed to handle it.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ISAKSON.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To require a quarterly report on audits conducted by the \n Defense Contract Audit Agency of task or delivery order contracts and \n other contracts related to security and reconstruction activities in \n Iraq and Afghanistan and to address irregularities identified in such \n                                reports)\n\n       On page 169, between lines 8 and 9, insert the following:\n\n\n          audits of defense contracts in iraq and afghanistan\n\n       Sec. 1122. (a)(1) Not later than 90 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense, in \n     consultation with the Director of the Defense Contract Audit \n     Agency, shall submit to the Committee on Appropriations and \n     the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate and the \n     Committee on Appropriations and the Committee on Armed \n     Services of the House of Representatives a report that lists \n     and describes audits conducted by the Defense Contract Audit \n     Agency of task or delivery order contracts and other \n     contracts related to security and reconstruction activities \n     in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n       (2) The Secretary of Defense shall identify in the report \n     submitted under paragraph (1)--\n       (A) any such task or delivery order contract or other \n     contract that the Director of the Defense Contract Audit \n     Agency determines involves costs that are unjustified, \n     unsupported, or questionable, including any charges assessed \n     on goods or services not provided in connection with such \n     task or delivery order contract or other contract; and\n       (B) the amount of the unjustified, unsupported, or \n     questionable costs and the percentage of the total value of \n     such task or delivery order contract or other contract that \n     such costs represent.\n       (3) The Secretary of Defense shall submit to the Committee \n     on Appropriations and the Committee on Armed Services of the \n     Senate and the Committee on Appropriations and the Committee \n     on Armed Services of the House of Representatives an update \n     of the report submitted under paragraph (1) every 90 days \n     thereafter.\n       (b) In the event that any costs under a contract are \n     identified by the Director of the Defense Contract Audit \n     Agency as unjustified, unsupported, or questionable pursuant \n     to subsection (a)(2), the Secretary of Defense shall withhold \n     from amounts otherwise payable to the contractor under such \n     contract a sum equal to 115 percent of the total amount of \n     such costs.\n       (c) Upon a subsequent determination by the Director of the \n     Defense Contract Audit Agency that any unjustified, \n     unsupported, or questionable cost for which an amount payable \n     was withheld under subsection (b) has been justified, \n     supported, or answered, as the case may be, the Secretary of \n     Defense may release such amount for payment to the contractor \n     concerned.\n       (d) In each report or update submitted under subsection \n     (a), the Secretary of Defense shall describe each action \n     taken under subsection (b) or (c) during the period covered \n     by such report or update.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, with this supplemental appropriations bill, \nCongress will have appropriated $300 billion for military operations \nand reconstruction activities in Iraq and Afghanistan. That is an \nenormous sum of money. We say it is for the troops in the field, for \narmor, weapons, equipment, and other mechanisms necessary to wage a \nwar. But a significant portion does not make it to the troops. Much of \nit goes to defense contractors, corporate giants such as Halliburton \nthat profit from the military operations and defense expenditures of \nthe U.S. Government.\n  Halliburton reportedly has been awarded $11 billion in Iraq \ncontracts. The war in Iraq may symbolize a time of sacrifice for \nAmerican families, but for some--not all but for some--defense \ncontractors, the cold, hard truth is that Iraq has become an \nopportunity to reap an enormous profit from American's decision to send \nAmerica's sons and daughters into war. It is incumbent upon the \nCongress to be diligent in how these moneys are allocated to defense \ncontractors. It is incumbent upon the Congress to be thorough in its \noversight and to be meticulous in its accounting.\n  The administration has submitted five emergency supplemental spending \nbills for Iraq and Afghanistan. The size of these supplemental requests \nis massive, exceeding $80 billion this year, $25 million last year, and \n$160 billion the year before that. Most of these costs are being \nconsidered outside the checks and oversight of the regular budget and \nappropriations process. It is a confusing and, at times, a beguiling \nprocess that results in enormous sums of money flowing to contractors \nin Iraq, oftentimes without adequate oversight. Such a process invites \nwaste, abuse, and fraud.\n  I don't belittle the role of defense contractors in Iraq. I belittle \nthe circumstances that the administration has fostered. I belittle the \nsuspicion that this administration has created by veiling its \ncontractor negotiations in secrecy, and the whirlwind of allegations of \nmisconduct and fraud that the administration has invited by not sharing \ninformation with the people of the United States, the American public.\n  The American people have good reason to question the costs emanating \nfrom contractors in Iraqi oil fields and Iraqi communities.\n  Three separate Government auditors have criticized contractor waste \nin Iraq. Government investigators point\n\n[[Page S3795]]\n\nto unsubstantiated costs and to sloppy accounting. Fortune magazine's \nanalysis of Government reports found $2 billion of unjustified or \nundocumented charges. The Pentagon's Defense Contract Audit Agency has \ncited inadequacies and deficiencies in contractor billing systems, \nalong with unreasonable and illogical cost justification. The Wall \nStreet Journal reports that Pentagon auditors are investigating whether \nHalliburton overcharged taxpayers by $212 million for delivering fuel \nto Iraq.\n  Questions have arisen in the House of Representatives about why these \ncosts had been concealed from international auditors. The Government \nAccountability Office has cited the risks of inadequate cost controls \nfor contractors in Iraq. The Coalition Provisional Authority's \ninspector general cited millions of dollars in overcharges from \nHalliburton employees indulging themselves at the Kuwait Hilton. \nImagine U.S. soldiers in the field forced to survive on military \nrations and suffering the unbearable heat of the desert while \nHalliburton employees enjoy the breakfast buffet in an air-conditioned \nHilton.\n  The House Government Reform Committee reported hundreds of millions \nof dollars in waste by some contractors. A glance at the committee Web \nsite reveals tens of millions of dollars in questionable charges--task \norder after task order showing $86 million in unexplained charges, $34 \nmillion in unsupported costs, $36 million in unjustified expenditures, \nand so on and so on. Incredibly, the Defense Department--your Defense \nDepartment, my Defense Department--is paying these charges, even though \ntheir own auditors are telling them that the charges are unjustified.\n  One example reported in the Wall Street Journal: Halliburton's \nKellogg, Brown & Root charged taxpayers for dining facility services in \nIraq and Kuwait. Pentagon auditors flagged $200 million of unsupported \ncosts--that is a lot of money--$200 million of unsupported costs, but \nthe Defense Department released $145 million in compensation to \nKellogg, Brown & Root despite auditors' reservations and despite \nHalliburton's inability to justify the charge.\n  It is the taxpayers--you people out there watching through those \nlenses, those electronic lenses, watching the Senate floor, I am \ntalking about you--it is the taxpayers, your constituents, Mr. \nPresident, my constituents, who are being charged for this tripe. It is \nthey who must bear the costs of such rip-offs. It is your money.\n  Our constituents read in the newspapers how lucrative contracts are \nawarded without competition, how enormous rewards are handed to \ncampaign donors. Mention the name Halliburton, and, as Fortune magazine \nquips, an image flashes in the public's mind of ``a giant corporation \nengaged in shameless war profiteering--charging outrageous prices to \nprovide fuel for Iraqis and meals for American troops.''\n  Our constituencies, the people who send us here, are crying out for \nCongress to assume a stronger oversight role and to assure them, the \npeople, that their moneys are being spent wisely. The amendment I have \noffered today does exactly that. My amendment requires the Defense \nSecretary to provide the Committee on Appropriations and the Armed \nServices Committee with a quarterly report that lists and describes \nquestionable and unsupported contractor charges identified by Pentagon \nauditors for Iraq and Afghanistan. The amendment requires the Defense \nSecretary to withhold 100 percent of the payment for these charges and \nto assess a penalty by withholding an additional amount equal to 15 \npercent of the unsupported charge. If Pentagon auditors can verify the \ncharges assessed by the contractor, that they are justifiable, then the \nDefense Secretary can release the payment.\n  My amendment is common sense. We ought not to be paying for services \nthat have not been rendered. The American people ought not be paying \nfor services that have not been rendered. The American people ought not \nbe paying more than a fair market price. The American people ought not \nallow contractors to think they can hoodwink the American citizen and \nget away with it.\n  The American public is being asked to sacrifice to pay for this war. \nThe President's budget cuts investments in education, in health care, \nin domestic priorities that impact every State of the Union in order to \npay for these military and reconstruction activities. Congress ought to \nensure--that is us--we ought to ensure that sacrifice is not wasted. We \nought to slap the knuckles--and slap them hard--of any contractor, \nwhether because of sloppy accounting or because of outright fraud, that \nresults in the American taxpayer being bilked.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment. I urge its adoption.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask my distinguished colleague from West \nVirginia if it would be in order to lay the amendment aside so I can \nsend to the desk another amendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. I have no objection.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 499\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I send amendment No. 499 to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner], for himself, Mr. \n     Nelson of Florida, Mr. Allen, Mr. Talent, Ms. Collins, and \n     Mr. Warner, proposes an amendment numbered 499.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent further reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n        (Purpose: Relating to the aircraft carriers of the Navy)\n\n       On page 169, between lines 8 and 9, insert the following:\n\n\n                     aircraft carriers of the navy\n\n       Sec. 1122. (a) Funding for Repair and Maintenance of U.S.S. \n     John F. Kennedy.--Of the amount appropriated to the \n     Department of the Navy by this Act, and by the Department of \n     Defense Appropriations Act, 2005 (Public Law 108-287; 118 \n     Stat. 954), an aggregate of $288,000,000 may be available \n     only for repair and maintenance of the U.S.S. John F. \n     Kennedy, and available to conduct such repair and maintenance \n     of the U.S.S. John F. Kennedy as the Navy considers \n     appropriate to extend the life of U.S.S. John F. Kennedy.\n       (b) Limitation on Reduction in Number of Active Aircraft \n     Carriers.--No funds appropriated or otherwise made available \n     by this Act, or any other Act, may be obligated or expended \n     to reduce the number of active aircraft carriers of the Navy \n     below 12 active aircraft carriers until the later of the \n     following:\n       (1) The date that is 180 days after the date of the \n     submittal to Congress of the quadrennial defense review \n     required in 2005 under section 118 of title 10, United States \n     Code.\n       (2) The date on which the Secretary of Defense, in \n     consultation with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \n     certifies to Congress that such agreements have been entered \n     into to provide port facilities for the permanent forward \n     deployment of such numbers of aircraft carriers as are \n     necessary in the Pacific Command Area of Responsibility to \n     fulfill the roles and missions of that Command, including \n     agreements for the forward deployment of a nuclear aircraft \n     carrier after the retirement of the current two conventional \n     aircraft carriers.\n       (c) Active Aircraft Carriers.--For purposes of this \n     section, an active aircraft carrier of the Navy includes an \n     aircraft carrier that is temporarily unavailable for \n     worldwide deployment due to routing or scheduled maintenance.\n  Mr. WARNER. I am joined by the distinguished Senator from Florida, \nMr. Nelson, Senator Allen, Senator Martinez, Senator Talent, and \nSenator Collins. I am prepared to give my statement in support.\n  I see the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, the Senator from \nCalifornia, Mrs. Boxer, and I are waiting to speak about the tragic \ndeath of Marla Ruzicka over the weekend in the form of eulogies. I \ndon't want to interrupt the work of the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom Virginia, but when he is finished I am going to seek the floor--\nboth Senator Boxer and I--to give the eulogies, which will not take a \ngreat deal of time, but they are important.\n  Mr. WARNER. I think the Senator is asking that he be recognized at \nthe conclusion of the introduction of this amendment. Senator Nelson \nand I will be brief to accommodate our colleagues.\n  Mr. President, this amendment ensures that all necessary repair and \nmaintenance be accomplished on the USS John F. Kennedy to keep that \nship in active status. The amendment also requires the Navy to keep 12 \naircraft\n\n[[Page S3796]]\n\ncarriers until the later of several situations comes to the attention \nof the Senate and the Congress: 180 days after the next Quadrennial \nDefense Review is delivered to Congress, or the Secretary of Defense \nhas certified to Congress the necessary agreements have been entered \ninto to provide the port facilities for the permanent forward deployed \naircraft carriers deemed necessary to carry out the mission in their \narea of responsibility.\n  The ship, the USS Kennedy, was scheduled to start overhaul this \ncoming summer. There was $334.7 million authorized and appropriated in \nthe fiscal year 2005 for that purpose. So none of the funds in the \nunderlying bill in any way are garnered by this amendment.\n  In the last-minute budget cut in late December, the decision was made \nby the Department of Defense to defer maintenance and to decommission \nthe Kennedy.\n  The Chief of Naval Operations testified before the Senate Armed \nServices Committee on February 10 of this year that all 12 aircraft \ncarriers were in his original budget request. He stated, however, that \n``this action was driven by guidance'' from the office of Management \nand Budget that ``led to the reduction of our overall budget.''\n  That repair and maintenance should go forward, starting this summer \nas originally planned. It is premature to decommission this ship, which \nwas until this past December scheduled to remain in the fleet until \n2018.\n  The great ship, the John F. Kennedy, returned from deployment on \nDecember 13, 2004. I understand the ship is in good shape. In fact, in \nthe words of the battle group commander, whose flagship was the \nKennedy, the ship returned from deployment in ``outstanding material \ncondition.''\n  The primary analytical document on military force structure is the \nQuadrennial Defense Review, or QDR. The QDR is, in the end, a \ncompilation of detailed analyses of what the Nation requires to execute \nthe National Military Strategy.\n  I believe Congress should show restraint when it comes to making \nforce structure decisions, and only do so in the context of the reports \nand the analyses produced by the Department of Defense and such other \nreports that may be relevant. In this case, however, the analyses that \nare available to us supports a force structure of 12 aircraft carriers, \nnot 11.\n  I also believe that, at some point, the number of aircraft carriers \nmatters. If the aircraft carrier is not where the President needs it to \nbe when a crisis erupts, its capabilities, however awesome, are not \nvery meaningful.\n  The deliberations on the next QDR have already begun, in accordance \nwith the law, and it should be delivered by this time next year. It may \nshow, with analytical rigor, that the number of aircraft carriers can \nbe reduced. It may not.\n  Nowhere is naval power more important to the National Military \nStrategy than in the Pacific Command Area of Responsibility.\n  After retirement of the USS Kitty Hawk in fiscal year 2008, the \nKennedy, if retained, would be the last remaining conventional aircraft \ncarrier.\n  This amendment ensures we have the aircraft carriers necessary to \nkeep this area of the world covered until such time that the QDR, the \nGlobal Posture Review, and other uncertainties have been resolved.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. President, the CNO appeared before our committee here of recent.\n  Now I will yield to my distinguished colleague from Florida, who was \npresent during the course of that testimony, to insert that part which \nwas in open session, which I think we should share with our colleagues. \nMr. President, I see the distinguished Senator from Florida, my \nprincipal cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, because Senator Leahy is \nwaiting to speak, I will make very brief comments. The comments to \nwhich the distinguished chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee \nhas referred is the Chief of Naval Operations saying it is absolutely \nessential that he have a carrier home ported in Japan. The fact is, as \nhe projects his forces in the defense of our country in the Pacific \narea of operations, he needs a carrier in that region so if it has to \nrespond to an emergency, say, off of the coast of Taiwan, it is within \na day and a half of sailing to respond to the emergency instead of a \nweek's sailing from a port on the west coast of the United States.\n  Now, how all this ties in to the John F. Kennedy is that we do not \nknow at this point that the Government of Japan--since so much of this \ndecision is influenced by the municipal government in the region of the \nport--is going to receive a nuclear carrier. Therefore, when the \npresent, conventionally powered carrier, the Kitty Hawk, in Japan, is \nready to go out of service in 2008, if Japan's posture is they will not \naccept a nuclear carrier, then we do not have another one that could \nreplace it.\n  So what the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee is \nsuggesting in this amendment that many of us are sponsoring with him is \nto keep alive the John F. Kennedy through its drydocking, with the \nfunds that have already been appropriated, the $335 million, of which \nthere are some $287 million left, to go on through the overhaul process \nso we have it as a backup.\n  This, of course, also keeps us then with two major ports for carriers \non the east coast so that all of our east coast carrier assets are not \nin one port. In this era of terrorism, that clearly is one of the \nlessons we should have learned way back in December of 1941 in the \nexperience of Pearl Harbor: Keep your assets spread out.\n  I am very grateful to Senator Warner, who has offered this amendment \nfor the sake of the defense of our country. And for the sake of those \nof us who have been working this problem, we are very grateful in order \nto get this in front of the Senate so a policy decision can be made.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the Senator from Vermont allow me the opportunity \nto offer an amendment? I do not know how long he will be speaking.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, am I correct that the Senator from Alabama \nonly needs a minute or so?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Less than that.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will withhold my recognition so he can do \nthat.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized to \noffer an amendment.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendments be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 456\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 456.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alabama [Mr. Sessions] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 456.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     (Purpose: To provide for accountability in the United Nations \n                    Headquarters renovation project)\n\n         On page 183, after line 23, insert the following:\n\n\n              UNITED NATIONS HEADQUARTERS RENOVATION LOAN\n\n       Sec. 2105.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be set aside.\n\n[[Page S3797]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom California, Mrs. Boxer, be recognized following me, and that the \ntwo of us be recognized as in morning business to speak about the \ntragic death this weekend of Marla Ruzicka.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Hearing no objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Marla Ruzicka\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I join my good friend, the Senator from \nCalifornia, in paying tribute to a remarkable young woman from \nLakeport, CA, Marla Ruzicka.\n  There are times when we are called upon to give speeches such as this \non the floor. They are never easy. Sometimes they are speeches given \nabout somebody at the end of a long and full life. Here we are speaking \nabout a young woman at the beginning of a life already full but with \npromise for decades to come.\n  Marla was the founder of a humanitarian organization called Campaign \nfor Innocent Victims in Conflict which is devoted to helping the \nfamilies of Afghan and Iraqi citizens who have been killed or suffered \nother losses, such as their homes destroyed, businesses destroyed, as a \nresult of U.S. military operations. We know such suffering occurs no \nmatter how careful the military may be.\n  But Saturday, Marla died in Baghdad. She died from a car bomb, a car \nbomb not directed at her but directed at a convoy. She was doing the \nwork she loved and which so many people around the world admired her \nfor. She was on her way to help somebody else. It was the case of being \nat the wrong place at the wrong time. But it was not unusual because \nshe had risked her life so many times in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n  I met Marla 3 years ago when she first came to Washington. She was \nbarely 26 years old. She had been in Afghanistan. She had seen the \neffects of the U.S. bombing mistakes that destroyed the homes and lives \nof innocent Afghan citizens. In one or two incidents, wedding parties \nhad been bombed. In others, the bombs missed their targets and instead \ndestroyed homes and neighborhoods.\n  I remember one incident she spoke of where every member of a family--\n16 people--was killed except a young child and that child's \ngrandfather. These were the cases Marla spoke about. She spoke about \nthem passionately because she felt passionately that the United States \nshould help those families put their lives back together.\n  She met with me. She met in my office with Tim Rieser, who works on \nappropriations for me in the Foreign Operations Subcommittee. It did \nnot take her long to convince either Tim or myself that she was so \nobviously right. We knew we not only had a moral responsibility to \nthose people who had suffered because of the mistakes of the United \nStates, we also had an interest in mitigating the hatred, the \nresentment toward Americans that those incidents had caused.\n  It was Marla's initiative--going to Afghanistan, meeting those \nfamilies, getting the media's attention, coming back here and meeting \nwith me and Tim and others--that led to the creation of a program that \nhas contributed more than $8 million for medical assistance, or to \nrebuild homes, provide loans to start businesses, and provide other aid \nto innocent Afghan victims of the military operations.\n  From Afghanistan, Marla went to Iraq. She arrived, as I recall, a day \nor two after Saddam's statue fell. She and her Iraqi colleague, Faiez \nAli Salem, who died at the same time, the same place as Marla, \norganized dozens of Iraqi volunteers to conduct surveys around the \ncountry of civilian casualties. Then she returned to Washington and \nagain her efforts--I have to emphasize, her efforts, her personal \nefforts, her pounding on doors, her going person to person with her \nirrepressible energy--led to the creation of a program now known as the \nCivilian Assistance Program which has provided $10 million to the \nfamilies and communities of Iraqi citizens killed by the U.S. and other \ncoalition forces--another $10 million was allocated for this program \nlast week--all by this happy, young woman you see depicted here, \nsitting with the people she helped.\n  To my knowledge, this is the first time we have ever provided this \ntype of assistance to civilian victims of U.S. military operations. It \nwould never have happened without the initiative, the courage, the \nincomparable force of character of Marla Ruzicka.\n  In my 31 years as a Senator, I have met a lot of interesting, \naccomplished people from all over the world, as all of us do--Nobel \nPrize recipients, heads of State, people who have achieved remarkable \nand even heroic things in their lives. I have never met anyone like \nMarla. She made sure we knew what she was doing and how we could help. \nTim Rieser received an e-mail from her within an hour of the time she \nwas killed. He sent it on to me during the middle of the night, \nSaturday night, with the photographs of Marla and the little girl she \nhad helped.\n  I know how both my wife Marcelle and I felt, looking at those \npictures, knowing we would never see another. There are so many stories \nabout her, and some of them are being recounted now in the hundreds of \npress articles that have appeared in just the past 48 hours.\n  One story I remember the day after Marla arrived in Washington from \nKabul. She had heard there was a hearing in the Senate where Secretary \nRumsfeld and General Franks were going to testify. Thinking, perhaps a \nbit naively, that they might talk about the problem of civilian \ncasualties, she decided to go hear what they would say. After the \nhearing was over, obviously disappointed that the issue she cared so \ndeeply about hadn't even been mentioned, Marla walked straight up to \nSecretary Rumsfeld at the witness table and started talking to him.\n  He heads down the hallway; she heads down the hallway with him. I can \nimagine what the security people felt. She followed him right outside \nto his car, and she did not stop talking to him about the families of \ncivilians she had met who had been killed and injured and the need to \ndo something to help them.\n  Anybody who knew Marla can see that. Secretary of Defense? Secretary \nof State, Senator, it didn't make any difference. She had a story to \ntell and, by golly, you were going to hear that story. You could run \ndown the hall, you could go to the elevator, but you were going to hear \nher story. She was not someone who was easy to say no to.\n  Not easy? It was almost impossible to say no to her. That was not \nsimply because she was insistent. We all have insistent people who come \nto our offices. We have all developed ways to say no. But in her case, \nshe was not just insistent, she was credible. She had been there. She \nknew what the war was about. She had seen the tragic results, and she \nwas not about blaming anyone. She wasn't there to blame others. She \njust said: Look, there are people who need help. I want to help in \nwhatever way I can.\n  That is what made it different. She saw her work as part of the best \nof what this country is about. It was the face of a compassionate \nAmerica she believed in. She wanted the people of Afghanistan and Iraq \nto see the face of the America she believed in, a compassionate, \nhumanitarian face.\n  It took time for some of us to realize she was not just a blond \nbundle of energy and charisma, which she was, but she was also a person \nof great intellect and courage who realized she wanted to help more \nvictims. It wasn't enough to protest; that you can do easily. She \nneeded to work with people who could help her do it. Of course, that \nmeant the Congress, the U.S. military, the U.S. Embassy, the press, \neverybody else involved. She understood that. So she put aside politics \nand focused on the victims. But she made sure the Congress, the U.S. \nmilitary, the U.S. Embassy and the press and everybody else heard from \nher. It didn't take long before the U.S. military saw the importance of \nwhat she was doing and they started to help. There were several civil \naffairs officers with whom Marla worked as a team. She would find the \ncases. They would arrange for the plane to airlift a wounded child to a \nhospital or some other type of assistance. She became one of our most \nbeloved ambassadors because she was doing what our ambassadors want to \ndo--put the good face, the humanitarian face, the loving and caring \nface of America first and foremost.\n\n[[Page S3798]]\n\n  I think one of the reasons so many people around the world feel \nMarla's loss so deeply is because we saw how important her work was, \nand that meant taking risks the rest of us are unwilling take. In a \nway, she was not only helping the families of Iraqi war victims; she \nwas also helping us, until she finally became an innocent victim of war \nherself. Yesterday, my phone rang so many times, people calling from \nBaghdad, calling me at home. Every one of them had a different story of \nsomething she had done, some way in which she had made somebody's life \ndifferent. She has been called many things: an angel of mercy, a ray of \nsunshine in an often dangerous and dark world.\n\n  One person who knew her well described Marla as being as close to a \nliving saint as they come. I suspect that is how many of us feel. She \nprobably didn't feel that way herself. Many of us feel that way.\n  I don't think I have ever met, and I probably will never meet again, \nsomeone so young who gave so much of herself to so many people and who \nmade such a difference doing it. Our hearts go out to her parents, \nCliff and Nancy. I talked to her father yesterday. I said: Think how \nmuch she did in her short lifetime, more than most of us will get to do \nin a lifetime. But I thanked them for having the courage to let her be \nthe person she wanted to be--not that I suspected anybody could have \nstopped her from being what she wanted to be.\n  One of the articles talks about her going to a checkpoint and the \nguard stopping her and she didn't have the proper papers. She stuck her \nhead forward and pulled back the scarf. They saw the blond hair. She \nstarted talking to them about why she had to go here and there. Next \nthing you know, she is being sent on her way.\n  So our job is really to carry on the work Marla started not just in \nmemory of a wonderful and heroic young woman, although that should be \nenough reason, but because the work is so important. That is what I am \ncommitted to. I know I will work with my friend from California to \nhonor Marla in that way. I think it would be safe to say to my friend \nfrom California, I suspect there will be others in this Chamber who \nwill do the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank Senator Leahy, from the bottom of \nmy heart, for his words about this extraordinary young woman; more than \nthat, to him and his staff for believing in her. That took a leap of \nfaith, that a woman so young could come in and present as compelling a \ncase as she did.\n  Of course, she went right to the Senator, that is for sure, because \nof the work he has done for human rights in the world. She knew what \nshe was doing. But you heard her and Tim and you rolled up your sleeves \nand created a program that the entire Senate backed and the entire \nCongress backed to help the innocent victims of war--those who are \nunfortunately sometimes called ``collateral damage''; we have names for \nthat.\n  Clearly, what Marla did, by recognizing that these people needed \nhelp, she was doing God's work. But she also, as the good Senator \npointed out, was helping the United States of America because we are in \nthe battle for the hearts and minds of the world. Marla understood \nthat.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 444\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Before I make further remarks, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the pending amendment be temporarily laid aside so I can call up \namendment No. 444.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer], for herself, and \n     Mr. Bingaman, proposes an amendment numbered 444.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     (Purpose: To appropriate an additional $35,000,000 for Other \n Procurement, Army, and make the amount available for the fielding of \n            Warlock systems and other field jamming systems)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n\n     deployment of warlock systems and other field jamming systems\n\n       Sec. 1122. (a) Additional Amount for Other Procurement, \n     Army.--The amount appropriated by this chapter under the \n     heading ``Other Procurement, Army'' is hereby increased by \n     $35,000,000, with the amount of such increase designated as \n     an emergency requirement pursuant to section 402 of the \n     conference report to accompany S. Con. Res. 95 (108th \n     Congress).\n       (b) Availability of Funds.--Of the amount appropriated or \n     otherwise made available by this chapter under the heading \n     ``Other Procurement, Army'', as increased by subsection (a), \n     $60,000,000 shall be available under the Tactical \n     Intelligence and Related Activities (TIARA) program to \n     facilitate the rapid deployment of Warlock systems and other \n     field jamming systems.\n  Mrs. BOXER. My amendment would increase funding for jamming devices \nthat would deactivate roadside bombs. They are one of the leading \ncauses of the casualties in Iraq.\n  Mr. President, I will get back to the tribute I want to give to \nMarla. I thank Laura Schiller, my staff member, who is sitting here \nwith me. She helped me put together these remarks. She was a friend of \nMarla's, and it was very hard for her to get through writing these \nremarks.\n  This morning, in northern California, where I was--I just got here--\nthe people woke up to the San Francisco Chronicle's front page. It is \nthis magnificent picture of Marla and a little girl she helped, along \nwith an Iraqi woman who had clearly also been working with this little \nchild.\n  It is interesting because on either side of this beautiful photograph \nof Marla and this little girl are two very negative stories about the \nworld we live in--Medicare fraud and oil companies trying to lower \ntheir taxes in light of their highest profits ever--and it just spoke \nto me about Marla because there she was in the middle of all these \nnegative forces, the worst kinds of negative forces--war, hatred, \nsectarian violence, all these things, there she was right in the \nmiddle, something good for us to cling to.\n  My heart breaks for Marla's family and her friends. Some of them were \nhere, so many whose lives she touched. One of Marla's friends was my \ndaughter Nicole who called me with the news of Marla's death on \nSaturday night. It was hard to understand her at first, so heavy were \nher tears. Between sobs, she told me Marla had been killed along the \ntreacherous road leading to the Baghdad airport. It was a road so \ndangerous that when Senators travel there--and I just got back from \nthere a couple weeks ago--they don't go on that road. Instead, they go \non a Blackhawk helicopter and speed through a city with machine guns on \neither side looking down to the ground. It is a road so dangerous that \neven limited protection costs thousands of dollars--tens of thousands \nof dollars just to go one way on that road, if you were to hire people \nto help protect you. That is how dangerous it is.\n  Who among us would have found the courage to travel on that road on \nSaturday, or the road that Marla had traveled during her courageous, \ncommitted, and very short life? Who among us can say we have spent so \nmuch of our lives serving other people in the way that truly makes a \ndifference? How many 28-year-olds can say that?\n  Imagine, in this the most powerful and greatest country in the world, \nit was this remarkable woman who went door to door counting Iraqi \ncivilian victims, when nobody else would. It was this young woman who \nlobbied the Senate for assistance for these families, and we heard from \nSenator Leahy about how incredible she was when she made the case. She \nrisked her own life to make sure they received the support they \ndeserved.\n  ``Marla was something close to a saint,'' one friend wrote this \nmorning, ``but a very realistic saint.'' I personally met Marla for the \nfirst time recently when she and her mother came to my home in \nCalifornia to celebrate an occasion for my daughter. When Marla walked \nthrough our front door with her mom, she had an infectious smile, and \nmy daughter's face lit up. ``This is the amazing woman I've been \ntelling you about, Mom,'' she said.\n  This is how it always was for the thousands around the world lucky \nenough to call Marla a friend. It didn't matter if you lived in the \nstreets of Baghdad or the dusty villages of Afghanistan or the \ncorridors of power in\n\n[[Page S3799]]\n\nWashington, DC. It didn't matter whether you knew Marla. She would come \nup to you and you would feel as if you had known her for a lifetime.\n  She treated every conversation as a chance to tell you about the \nrighteousness of her cause, and she treated everyone with the same \nrespect, openness, and unconditional love.\n  We so often hear:\n\n       And now three remain: faith, hope, and love. But the \n     greatest of these is love.\n\n  My office was flooded today with e-mails and phone calls from the \npeople whose lives were touched by Marla's faith, hope, and love. \nEveryone has a story to tell, and I brought a few photos to share with \nyou because words are not enough.\n  In this photo she sent hours before her death, we see her holding \ntightly an Iraqi child who was thrown from a vehicle just before it was \nblown up in a rocket attack. The child's entire family was killed. \nMarla saved that child.\n  Here we see one of the countless civilians brutally injured and now \nbeaming and healthy next to the person, Marla, who helped her heal.\n  We see Marla's trusted Iraqi colleague, Faiz, whom she wrote, ``was \nsent to me by angels from the sky.'' He worked tirelessly beside her, \nand he died bravely beside her.\n  And we see this beautiful, vibrant, young woman, red scarf around her \nneck, surrounded by the soldiers she befriended and entreated in her \nquest to help Iraqi civilians. Senator Leahy made the point that \neveryone wanted to help Marla--everyone. The U.S. military wanted to \nmake up for the damage that was caused. They desperately wanted to do \nthat, but they needed someone who could give them accurate information, \nand she did that.\n\n       Inside the green zone--\n\n  One friend wrote last night--\n\n     she would encourage military officers and U.S. officials to \n     hug each other--just to remember that they were still human, \n     and reward them with a big smile if they actually did it.\n\n  There are many other pictures that her friends wanted to share of a \nwoman who was a great friend to all and a beloved Ambassador for the \nUnited States at a time when our actions may not be so popular.\n  There were images of the notes she sent, when their spirits were at \ntheir lowest, telling them how beautiful they are, how much their work \nmattered, how much she cared.\n  I think we are going to leave this picture up because it is \nexquisite. There are other pictures of Marla sleeping on the floor for \nnights on end so she could use her limited resources to help Iraqi \nvictims. Behind her happy-go-lucky demeanor, there was a picture of an \neffective advocate cornering a Defense Secretary, a general, or, yes, a \nU.S. Senator, and refusing to go away until our country helped care for \nthe innocent victims of war.\n  There was a picture of the room full of journalists waiting that last \nnight for their host to show up for another party she had planned to \nbuoy their spirits, and no doubt try to persuade them to write about \nthe victims she saw suffering terrible damage--not collateral damage \nbut critical damage.\n  A few days before she died, Marla wrote her own op-ed for the \nWashington Post. She talked about her most recent discovery--that the \nU.S. military was counting Iraqi civilian casualties in some places, \ndespite its claims to the contrary. She ended with these words:\n\n       . . . To me, each number is a story of someone whose hopes, \n     dreams, and potential will never be realized, and who left \n     behind a family.\n\n  The same can be said of Marla. Her hopes, her dreams, and her \npotential will never be realized, and she left behind a family. In all \nthe years I have lived, I do not know too many people who have made an \nimpact the way she has in those 28 short years. But I guarantee you, if \nMarla were here, she would not want us to weep, she would not want us \nto hide our heads. She would want us to keep fighting for the people \nand causes she had championed even before she was old enough to drive a \ncar. She would want us to remember the words of encouragement and \naction she sent constantly to friends and colleagues. Once she wrote, \n``Their tragedies are my responsibilities,'' and now her work must be \nours.\n  I hope a message goes out to the suicide bombers to stop what they \nare doing, to stop it now, and to those who would put together these \nroadside bombs to stop it now because everyone who is injured by this--\neveryone--has hopes and dreams and families and potential.\n  So her work must be ours. She was the voice of these victims to whom \nno one seems to pay much attention. We need to be her voice now.\n  ``And now these three remain: Faith, hope and love: But the greatest \nof these is love.''\n  Mr. President, may we join the grieving Ruzicka family and thousands \naround the world in paying tribute to a young woman of great faith, \nhope, and love by finishing the work she so courageously began and by \nworking to make sure this war will soon come to an end.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. First, I commend my colleagues from California and \nVermont for recognizing such a remarkable woman, someone who represents \neverything that is good and peaceful about America and who set an \nexample in such a tumultuous time and place but clearly giving all of \nthe love she had to give at a time when it was needed the most. I thank \nmy colleagues for taking the time to recognize that.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 481\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to lay aside the \npending amendment, and I call up amendment No. 481.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mrs. Lincoln] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 481.\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To modify the accumulation of leave by members of the \n                            National Guard)\n\n       On page 169, between lines 8 and 9, insert the following:\n\n\n         accumulation of leave by members of the national guard\n\n       Sec. 1122. Section 701(a) of title 10, United States Code, \n     is amended by adding at the end the following new sentence: \n     ``In the case of a member of the Army National Guard of the \n     United States or the Air National Guard of the United States \n     who serves on active duty for more than 179 consecutive days, \n     full-time training or other full-time duty performed by such \n     member during the 5-year period ending on the 180th day of \n     such service under a provision of law referred to in the \n     preceding sentence, while such member was in the status as a \n     member of the National Guard, and for which such member was \n     entitled to pay, is active service for the purposes of this \n     section.''.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment of \ngreat importance to the returning guardsmen and reservists in my home \nState and in many other States. I think many of my colleagues, in \nunderstanding what I am trying to do, will agree that it is the right \napproach and the right thing to do for the men and women from our \nStates who have done such an incredible job serving our Nation in Iraq \nand on behalf of not just Americans but the Iraqi people.\n  When our soldiers return home, some of them are finding they might \nonly have a week or less before they are expected to reenter the \nworkforce and return to civilian life. It is confusing at best to know \nwith what they are going to be faced. The price of gasoline has gone up \ntremendously since they deployed almost 2 years ago. They have seen a \nlot of changes in their communities, perhaps changes in their work, \nchanges in their families, the loss of loved ones, certainly the \ngrowing of their little biddies. But many of the soldiers of Arkansas's \n39th Infantry Brigade found they had absolutely no leave left when they \nreturned to our home State of Arkansas. This left them with very few \noptions other than to return to work immediately or, in some cases, to \nbegin looking for work immediately, within a week of when they returned \nto their home soil.\n  These soldiers had just spent nearly 18 months in Iraq, risking their \nlives to defend the freedoms we cherish as Americans. They witnessed \nscenes of tragedy and violence they never expected to encounter but \nwillingly accepted as part of their mission in service of this great \nNation. It is part of\n\n[[Page S3800]]\n\nour job as legislators to make sure they are taken care of when they \nreturn home, that we honor their sacrifices, their duty, and their \ncourage. We are not doing our job if soldiers are forced to return to \ncivilian life within a week of returning home from theater.\n  I have been out to Walter Reed, as have many of my colleagues, and \nseen our soldiers recovering from horrific wounds suffered in this \nconflict. One of the soldiers from Arkansas had taken a rocket-\npropelled grenade directly to his chest. You would not have known it, \nthough, from talking to him. He was proud of the work he and his fellow \nsoldiers had been doing in Iraq. He missed his unit and was ready to \nreturn to them and finish the rebuilding process they had begun.\n  As I left his room, one of the nurses approached one of my staffers \nand said that while many of the soldiers were doing very well, she was \nvery concerned for them once they got back to their homes, into their \ncommunities, trying to readjust themselves to a way of life from which \nthey had been absent while they were in Iraq, while they were \nexperiencing events that oftentimes only they could think of in their \nown hearts.\n  Many of them underwent daily therapy sessions where they discussed \nthese experiences with their fellow soldiers. Unfortunately for our \nguardsmen and reservists, they do not come back to a base where they \nare surrounded by people who have had a similar experience, people to \nwhom they can talk, people with whom they can empathize, those who can \nunderstand the unbelievable circumstances and situations they \nexperienced in Iraq.\n  The nurse was also concerned that what they were receiving in the \nhospital there would all end once they returned to their hometowns--the \ntherapy, the discussions, certainly the medical treatment.\n  Imagine you are a soldier who, thankfully, has made it home from Iraq \nor Afghanistan without serious injury, the joyousness of coming home to \nyour home, to your family, to your community, and upon returning to a \npace of life 180 degrees from anything you have witnessed within the \nlast year and a half, you are expected to turn on a dime and adjust \nimmediately to the world you left behind. This is a great injustice and \none that cannot be ignored.\n  My amendment is very simple. It would allow a guardsman to accrue \nbonus leave when he or she was placed on active duty for 6 months. This \nwould give guardsmen more leave by altering how training days for the \nNational Guard and Reserve are counted for the purposes of determining \ntheir leave. Currently, any training less than 29 consecutive days does \nnot count toward accruement of leave.\n  This amendment would change current policy when a guardsman is placed \non active duty for a period of 180 consecutive days. Upon that 180th \nconsecutive day of active duty, all previous days spent training in the \npast 5 years, no matter their duration, would be counted for the \npurpose of determining how many days of leave the guardsmen would have. \nThis would effectively give the guardsmen and reservist a bonus period \nof leave when they were deployed for longer than 6 months.\n  The look-back period for determining the new leave, as I mentioned, \nwould be capped at 5 years. This would prevent substantial disparities \nin accrued leave from occurring between a guardsman with 20 years of \nservice and a guardsman with only 3, perhaps.\n  We must do all we can to ensure our guardsmen are given every \nopportunity to readjust to life outside of the combat zone. When they \nreturn to our arms, we must embrace them and give them the time and the \nelements they need to readjust themselves. For some, it may be as \nsimple as getting their finances back in order or perhaps spending time \nwith their spouse or their children or their extended family. Maybe it \nis getting re-equipped back in their household or in their community. \nMaybe it is getting re-engaged, remembering those people who surround \nthem who can provide them the unconditional love and support they need \nto put behind them the experiences they may have had, so they can look \nforward and be proud of the service they have given and know their \ncountry embraces them.\n  For others, it may be more difficult. Either way, they deserve an \nopportunity to deal with these issues without having to worry about \nreturning to or finding work in order to put food on the table so soon \nafter giving so much in service to this great country.\n  Our guardsmen found themselves in two circumstances where they were \ngiven passes, but were required to take leave when they have returned \nnow from that 180-plus days of service, of giving their heart and soul \nto make sure the freedoms we enjoy are protected.\n  We should do all we can to make sure as they come back into our \nAmerican communities, they come back into their families, they can do \nit with dignity and the support of this great country and the military \nservice they have served.\n  I urge the Senate to adopt my amendment. I ask my colleagues to take \na look at it. I think it is very simple and something we could do \nwithout much folderol. We could get it done and make sure all these \nsoldiers are well taken care of.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise to talk a little bit regretfully \nabout the issue of immigration--regretfully, because the supplemental \nDefense bill that came out of the House of Representatives included the \nissue of immigration and therefore has opened it up for discussion here \nin the Senate.\n  Tonight I rise in support of the Craig amendment which will enact \nimportant reforms to the H-2A program that will help ensure Ohio's \nagricultural industry remains strong and vibrant. That has a lot to do \nwith immigration.\n  Agribusiness is the largest industry in the State of Ohio, \ncontributing $73 billion to our economy each year. I would like to keep \nit that way. My State ranks sixth nationally in the production of \nnursery and greenhouse crops, with a value of over a half billion \ndollars. We grow almost a quarter of a billion dollars worth of fruits \nand vegetables each year.\n  I want to stress how important these businesses are to Ohio and how \nvulnerable they are. These industries live and die in a very \ncompetitive marketplace, and having a stable and sufficient workforce \nis vital to their competitiveness in the global marketplace. \nUnfortunately, right now they have a major labor crisis. Without the \nguest workers who are essential to getting work done during peak \nseasons, agribusiness in Ohio as well as the rest of the country simply \nwould not have the workforce necessary to do their work and their \ncustomers would have to look elsewhere, very likely to overseas \nbusinesses for agricultural products.\n  I am told in the early 1990s our Nation exported twice the value of \nnursery and greenhouse crops to Canada than we imported. In the last \ndecade, Canada has overtaken us, and now the numbers have reversed, \nadding to our Nation's trade deficit. I would like to note that our \nneighbor, Ontario, has a very good guest worker program.\n  If we offshore our fruit, vegetable, nursery crops, and other \nproduction to Mexico and Canada, think of what we lose. We lose control \nof our food supply, and you know that is a national security issue. We \nlose jobs, and not just farmworker jobs. Agricultural economists tell \nus each farmworker job in these industries supports 3\\1/2\\ jobs in the \nsurrounding economy: processing, packaging, transportation, equipment, \nsupplies, lending, and insurance. They are good jobs, filled by \nAmericans. We lose them if we do not do this the right way.\n  Work in these industries in Ohio is seasonal, demanding, and out in \nthe weather. Many of our producers have tried to use the existing H-2A \nprogram. This is especially true of our nursery, sod, and Christmas \ntree growers. They represent 79 percent of the H-2A use in Ohio.\n  The program is expensive, bureaucratic, and a litigation nightmare--\nthat is the current program. The program is failing and it needs \nfixing. Many agricultural employers would like to use the program but \ndo not because of the uncertainty associated with the program. Not \nhaving access to legal, timely workers hurts these businesses. Crops \nare lost because workers are not available for the harvest. I \nunderstand from my colleague Senator Craig that out in California \nlettuce is\n\n[[Page S3801]]\n\nrotting in the field because there are not workers there to pick it.\n  Many of my H-2A-user growers and producers have been closely involved \nin the negotiations of AgJOBS, the amendment before us. They know \nimmigration and guest worker reform cannot be a partisan undertaking. \nThey have been creative and determined in finding common ground and \nproducing bipartisan legislation. Their survival depends on this Senate \npassing AgJOBS.\n\n  The toughest issue is what to do about the trained and trusted farm \nworkforce, 70 percent or more working without proper documents. Their \nlabor is critical to Ohio and America. These farmworkers are hard-\nworking, law-abiding people. They are paying Federal and State taxes \nand Social Security. They are part of the fabric of our society already \nin so many ways.\n  AgJOBS allows them to come forward and rehabilitate their status over \ntime through the time-honored values of hard work and good behavior. \nThe failure of this country to create a practical agricultural guest \nworker program has forced most of the country's agribusiness to live \nbetween a rock and a hard place. It has been said our farmers have one \nfoot in jail and the other in the bankruptcy court. Every day, each \ntime my constituents open the door in the morning, they know this much, \nif and when the Government decides to get serious about Social Security \nmismatch letters, about enforcement, it is all over.\n  They tell me: We are following the law in our hiring. Yet we know if \nImmigration enforcement came in tomorrow, our business would be \nirreparably damaged. My constituents and yours could lose their \nworkforce tomorrow.\n  Some of my colleagues are critical of this legislation because they \nclaim it provides amnesty. I disagree. Amnesty is an unconditional \npardon to a group of people who have committed an illegal act, and \nWebster's Dictionary agrees that is the definition. There is nothing \nunconditional about the path to rehabilitation provided in AgJOBS. To \nearn adjustment to legal status, a worker must have worked in U.S. \nagriculture before January 1, 2005. Accordingly, this legislation \nimposes conditions on obtaining adjustment to legal status, including, \nmore importantly, a work history.\n  These are people who have worked in the United States, many of them \nfor many years. A lot of them are not legal. What this legislation does \nis it provides an opportunity for them to become legal, after \nsupporting certain conditions.\n  If you believe that any forgiveness at all constitutes amnesty, then \nevery serious proposal that comes forward to solve this problem will be \namnesty. But in the end, isn't the worst amnesty of all the status quo? \nIgnoring and tacitly condoning this problem will not provide a \nsolution. It has been going on too long. Let us take a step forward now \ntoward reconciling our laws with reality.\n\n  This legislation will help illegal immigrants working in agriculture \nto come clean and become part of our legal workforce, allowing this \ncountry to focus its efforts on more serious immigration problems. \nFurthermore, providing a means for such workers to obtain legal status \nprovides a real incentive for them to participate in this program.\n  I read a portion of a letter Senator Craig and Congressman Cannon \nreceived from Grover Norquist, chairman of the Americans for Tax \nReform. He said:\n\n       I'd like to take this opportunity to commend for you the \n     introduction of S. 1645 and H.R. 3142. The AgJOBS bill is a \n     great step in bringing fundamental reform to our Nation's \n     broken immigration system. AgJOBS would make America more \n     secure. Fifty to seventy-five percent of the agriculture \n     workforce in this country is underground due to the highly \n     impractical worker quota restrictions. Up to 500,000 workers \n     would be given approved worker status screened by the \n     Department of Homeland Security and accounted for while they \n     are here. Any future workers coming into America looking for \n     agriculture work would be screened at the border where \n     malcontents can most easily be turned back. The current H2-A \n     agriculture worker program only supplies about 2 to 3 percent \n     of the farm workforce.\n\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       Workers that are here to work in jobs Native Americans are \n     not willing to do must stay if food production is to remain \n     adequate. However, those already here and new workers from \n     overseas should have a screening system that works, both for \n     our States' safety and for their human rights. Your bill does \n     just that.\n\n  Mr. President, I would also like to point out that AgJOBS is endorsed \nby a historic bipartisan coalition of 500 and counting, national, \nState, and local organizations, including 200 agricultural \norganizations representing fruit and vegetable growers, dairy \nproducers, nursery and landscape, ranching and others, as well as the \nNational Association of the State Departments of Agriculture; that is, \nthe national association of all of the 50 States' agriculture \ndepartments have come forward to support this. There is bipartisan \nsupport of this legislation by elected and appointed State directors of \nagriculture.\n  Yesterday I received a letter from Ambassador Clayton Yeutter. \nClayton Yeutter has been a tireless advocate for American agriculture. \nYou will remember that he served as Secretary of Agriculture under \nRonald Reagan and as U.S. Trade Representative under George H.W. Bush. \nIn his letter, he started out by saying:\n\n       History demonstrates that there are moments in time when \n     special opportunities arise for political action that \n     successfully addresses multiple challenges. Today is one of \n     those occasions.\n\n  I agree.\n  He went on to describe the substance and the partisanship of the \nAgJOBS bill.\n  He ended as follows:\n\n       As President Bush has stated, we can and must do better to \n     match a willing and hardworking immigrant worker with \n     producers who are in desperate need of a lawful workforce. It \n     is in our country's best interest to enact these reforms and \n     reap the harvest of political action at a special moment in \n     time.\n\n  That is what our President had to say.\n  Again, I agree.\n  I stand ready to take a first and most important step on this \ndifficult issue that has plagued this Nation for too long.\n  As I stated, I would have preferred that immigration would not have \nbeen a part of this legislation that is before us. But as I mentioned, \nit came before us because of the fact that the House decided to make \nimmigration a part of the emergency supplemental bill.\n  Those of us who have been concerned about immigration are taking this \nopportunity to clearly state what we think needs to be done. I am \nhopeful that tomorrow 59 of my colleagues will vote for cloture so we \ncan get on and deal with this issue and bring the relief to thousands \nof people, thousands of businesses, and agribusiness in this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, Edmundo Garcia said he had heard that the \nnew Bush immigration plan, which would grant work visas to millions of \nillegal immigrants inside the United States and to others who can prove \nthey have a job, was `amnesty,' and he wondered why he was arrested.''\n\n       He said he would try to cross [the border from Mexico to \n     the U.S. through the Sonoran Desert] again in a few days.\n\n  This quote from the New York Times on May 23, 2004, shows just how \nbad things have gotten since the administration's initial immigration \npolicy proposal was announced.\n  The New York Times article goes on to say:\n\n       Apprehensions of crossers in the desert south of Tucson \n     have jumped 60 percent over the previous year.\n\n  Nearly 300,000 people were caught trying to enter the U.S. through \nthe desert border since last October 1st (that's October 2003).''\n  It continues:\n\n       After a four-year drop, apprehensions which the Border \n     Patrol uses to measure human smuggling are up 30 percent over \n     last year along the entire southern border, with over 660,000 \n     people detained from October 1st through the end of April.\n\n  There are an estimated 8 to 12 million illegal immigrants in this \ncountry, with about 1 million new illegal aliens coming into this \ncountry every year. Legal immigration is even at unprecedented levels \nabout five times the traditional levels. We now have about 1.2 million \nlegal immigrants coming into this country each year, as opposed to an \naverage of about 250,000 legal immigrants before 1976.\n  S. 359, the AgJOBS bill, could offer amnesty to at least 800,000 more \nillegal\n\n[[Page S3802]]\n\naliens, and if they all bring family members, which they would be \neligible to do, it could be up to 3 million more, according to Numbers \nUSA.\n  I greatly respect my friend and colleague, the Senator from Idaho, \nMr. Craig, and I understand he has many cosponsors for his bill, but I \nfirmly believe S. 359 has some major flaws and is not the way to remedy \nour problem with illegal immigration.\n  Even though there are certain criteria these illegal aliens must meet \nto qualify for temporary work status and eventual citizenship under \nthis bill, it still rewards them by allowing them to stay in this \ncountry and work rather than penalizing them for breaking the law this \nis amnesty.\n  I also agree with my colleague from Texas, Senator Cornyn, the \nchairman of the Immigration Subcommittee, who said in Tuesday's \nCongress Daily when asked about the supplemental bill H.R. 1268, said \nthat he did not want it to ``be a magnet for other unrelated \nimmigration proposals . . . regular order is the best way. . . .''\n  I agree with my colleague and think we should focus on the \nsupplemental and debate immigration reform separately.\n  Furthermore, in section 2, paragraph 7, the AgJOBS bill defines a \nworkday as ``any day in which the individual is employed one or more \nhours in agriculture.''\n  In order for an alien to apply for temporary work status, section \n101, subsection A, subparagraph A states that the aliens ``must \nestablish that they have performed agricultural employment in the \nUnited States for at least 575 hours or 100 work days, whichever is \nless, during any 12 consecutive months. . . .''\n  So if a workday is defined as working at least 1 hour and the alien \nonly has to work 100 work days in a year to qualify for temporary \nstatus under the AgJOBS bill, then illegal aliens only have to find \nsome kind of agricultural work, and not necessarily be paid, for 100 \nhours, or merely 2 weeks, in a year in order to stay temporarily, while \nrobbing Americans of these jobs.\n  An article from May 18, 2004, by Frank Gaffney, Jr., from the \nWashington Times entitled ``Stealth Amnesty'' states that once an \nillegal alien has established lawful temporary residency, ``they can \nstay in the U.S. indefinitely while applying for permanent resident \nstatus.''\n  ``From there it is a matter of time before they can become citizens, \nso long as they work in the agricultural sector for 675 hours over the \nnext 6 years.''\n  Furthermore, in referring to the REAL ID Act, which was attached to \nthe supplemental in the House, and I believe is true reform, another \narticle from the week of April 6, appeared in the Washington Times \nstating:\n\n     . . . REAL ID is a bill that will strengthen homeland \n     security, while Mr. Craig's AgJOBS bill will not.\n\n  One more article in the Washington Times, again by Frank Gaffney, \nJr., from April 5 refers to the REAL ID Act as well as AgJOBS says:\n\n       The REAL ID legislation is aimed at denying future \n     terrorists the ability exploited by the September 11, 2001, \n     hijackers namely, to hold numerous valid driver's licenses, \n     which they used to gain access to airports and their targeted \n     aircraft.\n       It is no small irony, therefore, that the presence of the \n     REAL ID provisions on the military's supplemental funding \n     bill is being cited by the Senate parliamentarian as grounds \n     for Senator Larry Craig, Idaho Republican, to try to attach \n     to it legislation that would help eviscerate what passes for \n     restrictions on illegal immigration.\n\n  The article continues:\n\n       The agriculture sector of the US economy needs cheap labor.\n\n  So let's legalize the presence in this country of anyone who can \nclaim to have once worked for a little more than three months in that \nsector.\n  We must not reward lawbreakers especially while we have so many \npeople coming to this country legally.\n  Last summer, I had an intern in my office from Rwanda. She fled \nduring the genocide in 1994. She then came to this country as a refugee \nand became a legal permanent resident. It took her a year to get all \nher paperwork for becoming a legal resident and she will probably have \nto wade through similar bureaucracy to become a citizen as well. It \nfrustrates me that people like her follow the rules and have to wait in \nthe lines and wait for all the paperwork to be processed, while the \nillegal aliens can sneak into our country, and then, if they do apply \nfor legal status, they slow down the process for those who came here \nlegally. Not only does AgJOBS reward lawbreakers, it also robs many \nAmericans of jobs they are willing to do.\n  Roy Beck from Numbers USA in his testimony on March 24, 2004, before \nthe Subcommittee on Immigration, Border Security and Claims, quoted \nAlan Greenspan from February of last year as saying that America has an \n``oversupply of low-skilled, low-educated workers.'' In fact, according \nto Mr. Beck's testimony, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that \nthe number of unemployed Americans includes a majority of workers \nwithout a high school diploma.\n  Basically, we have a great supply of lower educated American workers \nwithout jobs, while ironically, the main purpose of the AgJOBS bill is \nto bring in low-educated, low-skilled foreign workers for jobs that \nthese Americans are able and willing to fill.\n  A recent article from March 31 of this year in the San Diego Union-\nTribune entitled ``Importing a Peasant Class'', written by Jerry \nKammer, emphasizes this point by saying:\n\n       Nearly two decades after a sweeping amnesty for illegal \n     immigrants [referring to the 1986 Amnesty] gave Gerardo \n     Jimenez a ticket out of a San Diego County avocado orchard, \n     he worries that the unyielding tide of low-wage workers from \n     Latin America might pull the economic rug out from under his \n     feet.\n\n  Jimenez, who is from Mexico and supervises a drywall crew that worked \nall winter remodeling an office building three blocks from the White \nHouse says, ``There are too many people coming.''\n  The article goes on to say:\n\n       Jimenez's concern reflects an ambivalence about immigration \n     among established immigrants in America.\n       It also challenges a key assumption of President Bush's \n     proposal for a massive new guest-worker program: that the \n     United States has a dearth of low-skill workers.\n\n  This is not true, we do not have a dearth of low-skill workers.\n  Not only does S. 359 keep able Americans from performing these jobs; \nit also drives down wages and stifles innovation and technology for \nthese jobs.\n  The same San Diego Union-Tribune article I just quoted from continues \nsaying:\n\n       In Atlanta, house painter Moises Milano says competition \n     for jobs is so stiff among immigrants that house painters' \n     wages have been flat since he came to the United States in \n     the late 1980.\n       They're still $9 an hour, he said, which would mean they've \n     actually fallen significantly when adjusted for inflation.\n       And yet many more aspiring house painters arrive every day \n     from Latin America.\n\n  Similar concerns can be heard throughout low-wage industries that \nLatino immigrants have come to dominate during recent decades, \nincluding housekeeping, landscaping, janitorial, chicken processing, \nmeat packing, restaurants, hotels and fast food.\n  The article goes on to say:\n\n       Jimenez says his company competes for contracts against \n     subcontractors using illegal workers who are prepared to work \n     for less and who don't expect health insurance, overtime or \n     other employment benefits.\n\n  ``It puts pressure on his employer to cut labor costs, he said.''\n  Jimenez explains why the migrants come and how it hurts current \nimmigrants: ``The migrants come because of hunger, because of necessity \n. . . but I would benefit if someone imposed order,'' he says. ``My \nwork would be worth more.''\n  Jimenez says that he won't be able to compete with companies that \nhire illegal workers so that they can pay lower wages.\n  Not only are workers like Jimenez facing tough competition from \ncompanies who hire illegals, but a GAO study from 1988 found that other \nfields, such as cleaning office buildings, were also experiencing lower \nwages and more competition as a result of foreign workers.\n  Cleaning office buildings used to pay a decent wage, however as more \nforeign workers entered the field, wages, benefits and working \nconditions began to collapse.\n  Other labor-intensive fields, such as the construction and the \nmeatpacking industry, have also experienced a drop in pay after an \ninflux of foreign workers. By allowing employers to flood the\n\n[[Page S3803]]\n\nlabor market with foreign workers in these sectors, wages and working \nconditions have gone down drastically and made these jobs much less \nattractive to American workers; while making them much more attractive \nto alien workers.\n  As for stifling technological advances, according to a February 9, \n2004, article appearing in National Review:\n\n     the huge supply of low-wage illegal aliens encourages \n     American farmers to lag technologically behind farmers in \n     other countries.\n\n  The article continues:\n\n       Raisin production in California still requires that grapes \n     be cut off by hand and manually turned on the drying tray.\n       In other countries, farmers use a labor-saving technique \n     called drying on the vine.\n       A cutoff of the illegal-alien flow would encourage American \n     farmers to adopt many of these technological innovations, and \n     come up with new ones.\n\n  Another, and possibly more important problem with S. 359, is the risk \nit poses to our homeland security. It has some of the same loopholes \nthat the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act, IRCA, contained.\n  It also overwhelms the already burdened immigration system, not to \nmention that there are no criminal or terrorist records for these \npeople. For example, an Egyptian illegal immigrant named Mahmud \nAbouhalima came to America on a tourist visa in 1985. The visa expired \nin 1986, but Abouhalima stayed here, working illegally as a cab driver.\n  Abouhalima received permanent residency, a green card, in 1988, after \nwinning amnesty under the 1986 IRCA law. Although he had never worked \nin agriculture in the United States, Abouhalima acquired legal status \nthrough the special agricultural workers program--which is essentially \nwhat the AgJobs bill does. Once he had become legalized, Abouhalima was \nable to travel freely to Afghanistan. He received combat training \nduring several trips there. Abouhalima used his amnesty/legalization \nand his terrorist training as a lead organizer of the 1993 plot to bomb \nthe World Trade Center and other New York landmarks.\n  The special agricultural worker amnesty program enacted as part of \nthe 1986 Amnesty saw many ineligible illegal aliens fraudulently apply \nfor, and successfully receive, amnesty. Up to two-thirds of illegal \naliens receiving amnesty under that program had submitted fraudulent \napplications, just like Abouhalima. We cannot afford to allow ourselves \nto be vulnerable to terrorists by allowing these people to stay in our \ncountry. I want to work with my colleague to address this problem of \nillegal immigration.\n  Over the last century, several Presidential and congressionally \nmandated Commissions including the 1907 Roosevelt Commission on Country \nLife to the 1990 Barbara Jordan Commission on Immigration Reform have \nbeen appointed to study immigration to the United States. These seven \nCommissions each possessing different mandates, membership makeup, \nstudies and historical context in which their work was performed had \nsome similar findings including: U.S. policy should actively discourage \nthe dependence of any industry on foreign workers.\n  Dependence on a foreign agricultural labor force is especially \nproblematic because of the seasonal nature of the work, which leads to \nhigh un- and under-employment and results in the inefficient use of \nlabor.\n  Strict enforcement of immigration and labor laws is the key to a \nsuccessful immigration policy that benefits the nation. Unfortunately, \nAgJOBS violates each of these principles.\n  It ensures the dependence of the agricultural industry on foreign \nworkers by eliminating any possibility that wages and working \nconditions in agriculture will improve sufficiently to attract U.S. \nworkers, whether citizens or lawful permanent residents.\n  AgJOBS actually reduces wages statutorily by freezing the required \nwage rate for new foreign workers, known as H-2A nonimmigrants, at its \nJanuary 1, 2003, level for 3 years. In Oklahoma it is currently $7.89.\n  It also actually discourages agricultural employers from pursuing \ninnovations, such as mechanization, that would reduce their reliance on \nseasonal labor.\n  AgJOBS guarantees employers an ``indentured'' labor force for at last \nthe first 6 years after enactment. Employers can pay as little as \nminimum wage while the newly amnestied workers have no choice but to \naccept whatever the employer offers them since they are required to \ncontinue working in agriculture in order to get a green card.\n  Additionally, AgJOBS requires the American taxpayer to foot the bill \nfor maintaining this large, seasonal workforce by allowing: Illegal \naliens who apply for amnesty under AgJOBS to receive taxpayer-funded \ncounsel from Legal Services Corporation to assist them with filling out \ntheir applications; the amnestied aliens to be eligible for \nunemployment insurance benefits if they are unable to find other \nunskilled work during the off-season, the amnestied aliens to use \npublicly funded services like education and emergency health care this \nis almost free since many of these aliens have artificially low wages \nthus making their tax contributions extremely low.\n  Finally, AgJOBS does not contain any provisions to tighten \nenforcement of U.S. immigration or labor laws. In fact, by rewarding \nillegal aliens with amnesty, AgJOBS will encourage even more illegal \nimmigration.\n  By the time the amnestied aliens are released from ``indentured \nservitude'' under AgJOBS, agricultural employers will have access to a \nwhole new population of illegal-alien workers and the cycle will be \nwell on its way to repeating itself, just as it did after the ``one-\ntime-only'' amnesty for agricultural workers in 1986.\n  I also believe both the REAL ID Act, sponsored by my colleague in the \nHouse, Congressman Sensenbrenner, as well as a bill I supported in the \nlast Congress, are sound ways to strengthen our immigration system. The \nREAL ID Act would make it more difficult for people who are violating \nour laws by being in our country illegally, as well as engaging in \nterrorist activities, to stay in the United States. Unfortunately, I \nwas forced to vote against the intelligence bill in December because \nthe provisions that are in the REAL ID Act were excluded from the \nintelligence bill.\n  One such provision in the current REAL ID Act has to do with a 3.5-\nmile gap in a border fence between San Diego and Tijuana. People are \nable to come and go as they please. This is where many illegal \nimmigrants are coming through; some of them could even be terrorists.\n  Apparently, this gap has been left open because of a maritime \nsucculent shrub, which is the environment in which two pairs of \nendangered birds live. These two pairs of birds, the vireo and the \nflycatcher, might be harassed--not killed--but harassed if the fence is \ncompleted.\n  I checked with the U.S. Geological Survey and found that there are an \nestimated 2,000 vireos and 1,000 flycatchers in existence today, and at \nthe most, not building the fence prevents two pairs of birds from being \nharassed. Is it better to harass two pairs of birds or leave this 3.5-\nmile gap open for terrorists or other law-breakers to come through? I \nassume that not building the fence, leaving it open for aliens to \ntrample on this environment, the home to these birds causes more \nharassment than actually building a fence.\n  Another provision in the REAL ID Act is the requirement for proof of \nlawful presence in the United States. This requirement applies to \nimmigration law provisions passed in 1996, which I supported.\n  The temporary license requirement, including a requirement that the \nlicense term should expire on the same date as a visa or other \ntemporary lawful presence-authorizing document, is in the REAL ID Act. \nThis means if you are here on a document--such as a visa--and it \nexpires, your driver's license should expire at the same time. Under \ncurrent law, this is not the case\n  The REAL ID Act requires official identification to expire on the \nsame date as a person's visa or other presence-authorizing document. \nElectronic confirmation by various State departments of motor vehicles \nto validate other States' driver's licenses is another important item \nin the REAL ID Act. Had Virginia officials referenced the Florida \nrecords of Mohammed Atta, one of the hijackers and masterminds behind \n9/11, when he was stopped in Virginia, it is likely they would have \ndiscovered that his license was not current. The REAL ID Act will make \nit difficult for instances such as this to take place.\n\n[[Page S3804]]\n\n  While I strongly support the steps taken in the REAL ID Act to \nstrengthen our immigration laws, I remain vigilant, and look forward to \nworking with my colleagues to ensure that American citizens' individual \nliberties are not infringed upon.\n  I also want to be aware of and oppose efforts to explicitly create a \nnational ID card which could contain all of a person's personal \ninformation.\n  Finally, in the 108th Congress, I cosponsored S. 1906, the Homeland \nSecurity Enhancement Act of 2003, which was introduced by my colleague \nfrom Alabama, Senator Sessions, and my former colleague from Georgia, \nSenator Miller, and was also cosponsored by my colleague from Idaho, \nSenator Craig. S. 1906 would give our law enforcement and immigration \nand border officers the tools and funding they need to do their jobs. \nMore specifically, S. 1906 would: clarify for law enforcement officers \nthat they have the legal authority to enforce immigration violations \nwhile carrying out their routine duties; increase the amount of \ninformation regarding deportable illegal aliens entered into the FBI's \nNational Crime Information Center database, making the information more \nreadily available to state and local officials; supply additional \nfacilities and beds to retain criminal aliens once they have been \napprehended, instead of releasing them, which occurs quite frequently; \nrequire the Federal Government to either take illegal aliens into \ncustody or pay the locality or State to detain them, instead of telling \nthose officials to release the aliens because no one is available to \ntake custody; require that criminal aliens be retained until \ndeportation under the Institutional Removal Program, so that they are \nnot released back into the community; mandate that States only give \ndriver's licenses to legal immigrants and make the license expire the \nsame day the alien's permission to be in the country expires.\n  In conclusion, let's work to improve and enforce our laws and not \nreward those who break them.\n  I ask unanimous consent that several pertinent articles be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, May 23, 2004]\n\n                Border Desert Proves Deadly for Mexicans\n\n                           (By Timothy Egan)\n\n       At the bottleneck of human smuggling here in the Sonoran \n     Desert, illegal immigrants are dying in record numbers as \n     they try to cross from Mexico into the United States in the \n     wake of a new Bush administration amnesty proposal that is \n     being perceived by some migrants as a magnet to cross.\n       ``The season of death,'' as Robert C. Bonner, the \n     commissioner in charge of the Border Patrol, calls the hot \n     months, has only just begun, and already 61 people have died \n     in the Arizona border region since last Oct. 1, according to \n     the Mexican Interior Ministry--triple the pace of the \n     previous year.\n       The Border Patrol, which counts only bodies that it \n     processes, says 43 people have died near the Arizona border \n     since the start of its fiscal year on Oct. 1, more than in \n     any other year in the same period.\n       Leon Stroud, a Border Patrol agent who is part of a squad \n     that has the dual job of arresting illegal immigrants and \n     trying to save their lives, said he had seen 34 bodies in the \n     last year. In Border Patrol parlance, a dead car and a dead \n     migrant are the same thing--a ``10-7''--but Mr. Stroud said \n     he had never gotten used to the loss of life.\n       ``The hardest thing was, I sat with this 15-year-old kid \n     next to the body of his dad,'' said Mr. Stroud, a Texan who \n     speaks fluent Spanish. ``His dad had been a cook. He was too \n     fat to be trying to cross this border. We built a fire and I \n     tried to console him. It was tough.''\n       If the pace keeps up, even with new initiatives to limit \n     border crossings by using unmanned drones and Blackhawk \n     helicopters in the air and beefed-up patrols on the ground, \n     this will be the deadliest year ever to cross the nation's \n     busiest smuggling corridor. The 154 deaths in the Border \n     Patrol's Tucson and Yuma sectors last year set a record.\n       ``This is unprecedented,'' said the Rev. John Fife, a \n     Presbyterian minister in Tucson who is active in border \n     humanitarian efforts. ``Ten years ago there were almost no \n     deaths on the southern Arizona border. What they've done is \n     created this gauntlet of death. It's Darwinian--only the \n     strongest survive.''\n       For years, deaths of people trying to cross the border \n     usually occurred at night on highways near urban areas, \n     killed by cars. But now, because urban entries in places like \n     San Diego and El Paso have been nearly sealed by fences, \n     technology and agents, illegal immigrants have been forced to \n     try to cross here in southern Arizona, one of the most \n     inhospitable places on earth.\n       They die from the sun, baking on the prickled floor of the \n     Sonoran Desert, where ground temperatures reach 130 degrees \n     before the first day of summer. They die freezing, higher up \n     in the cold rocks of the Baboquivari Mountains on moonless \n     nights. They die from bandits who prey on them, in cars that \n     break down on them, and from hearts that give out on them at \n     a young age.\n       The mountainous Sonoran Desert, between Yuma in the west \n     and Nogales in the east, is the top smuggling entry point \n     along the entire 1,951-mile line with Mexico, the Border \n     Patrol says. Through the middle of May, apprehensions of \n     crossers in the desert south of Tucson had jumped 60 percent \n     over the previous year. Nearly 300,000 people were caught \n     trying to enter the United States through the desert border \n     since last Oct. 1.\n       After a four-year drop, apprehensions--which the Border \n     Patrol uses to measure human smuggling--are up 30 percent \n     over last year along the entire southern border, with 660,390 \n     people detained from Oct. 1 through the end of April, federal \n     officials said.\n       The crossing here, over a simple barbed-wire fence, is \n     followed by a walk of two or three days, up to 50 miles on \n     ancient trails through a desert wilderness, to reach the \n     nearest road, on the Tohono O'odham Nation Indian \n     Reservation, a wedge of desert the size of Connecticut that \n     is overrun with illegal immigrants, or on adjacent federal \n     park or wildlife land. Most people start off with no more \n     than two gallons of water, weighing almost 17 pounds, in \n     plastic jugs. In recent days, with daytime temperatures over \n     100 degrees in the desert, a person needed a gallon of water \n     just to survive walking five miles.\n       The desert is littered with garbage--empty plastic jugs, \n     discarded clothes, toilet paper.\n       ``My feet hurt and I'm thirsty, but I will try again after \n     a rest,'' said Edmundo Saenz Garcia, 28, who was apprehended \n     on the reservation one morning near the end of his journey. \n     His toes were swollen and blistered. He walked in cowboy \n     boots. After being fingerprinted for security, he will be \n     sent back to Mexico, agents said.\n       Mr. Garcia said he had heard that the new Bush immigration \n     plan, which would grant work visas to millions of illegal \n     immigrants inside the United States and to others who can \n     prove they have a job, was ``amnesty,'' and he wondered why \n     he was arrested. He said he would try to cross again in a few \n     days.\n       ``It's like catch-and-release fishing,'' Mr. Stroud, the \n     Border Patrol agent, said with a shrug after helping Mr. \n     Garcia with his blisters. ``One week, I arrested the same guy \n     three times. If I dwell on it, it can be frustrating.''\n       Agents and groups opposed to open borders say the spike in \n     crossings and deaths are the fault of the Bush proposal, \n     which is stalled in Congress and unlikely to be acted on this \n     year. But it has created a stir in Mexico, they say.\n       ``They've dangled this carrot, and as a result \n     apprehensions in Arizona are just spiking beyond belief,'' \n     said T. J. Bonner, president of the National Border Patrol \n     Council, which represents about 9,000 agents. ``The average \n     field agent is just mystified by the administration's \n     throwing in the towel on this.''\n       Mr. Bonner, who is not related to the border commissioner, \n     said the people were crossing in huge numbers, even at the \n     high risk of dying in the desert, because ``they're trying to \n     get in line for the big lottery we've offered them.''\n       With an estimated 8 million to 12 million immigrants in \n     this country illegally--and only a handful of prosecutions of \n     employers who hire them--the southern border is more broken \n     now than at any time in recent history, said Mark Krikorian, \n     executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a \n     research group opposed to increased immigration.\n       ``We've created an incentive to take foolish risks,'' Mr. \n     Krikorian said. ``In effect, we're saying if you run this \n     gauntlet and can get over here, you're home free.''\n       Bush administration officials say there is only anecdotal \n     evidence, from field agents, that their proposal has caused \n     the spike in crossings. They point to a new $10 million \n     border initiative and indications in recent weeks that \n     apprehensions have leveled off as evidence that they are \n     getting the upper hand on the Arizona border. It is the last \n     uncontrolled part of the line between Mexico and the United \n     States, they said.\n       ``Unfortunately, there have always been deaths on the \n     border,'' said Mario Villareal, a spokesman for the Border \n     Patrol in Washington.\n       It was 3 years ago this month that 14 people died trying to \n     walk cross the desert near this small tribal hamlet, dying of \n     heat-related stress in what the poet Luis Alberto Urrea \n     called ``the largest death event in border history.'' Mr. \n     Urrea is the author of ``The Devil's Highway'' (Little, Brown \n     and Company), an account of the crossing and border policy.\n       He wrote that the Sonoran Desert here ``is known as the \n     most terrible place on earth,'' where people die ``of heat, \n     thirst and misadventure.''\n       To curb deaths, the American government has been running an \n     advertising campaign in Mexico, warning people of the \n     horrors.\n       ``The message is, `No mas cruces en la frontera,' `no more \n     crosses on the border,' '' Commissioner Bonner said in \n     unveiling the\n\n[[Page S3805]]\n\n     new plan earlier this month in Texas. He said 80 percent of \n     the deaths in a given year happen between May and August.\n       The government has also increased staffing of Border Patrol \n     Search Trauma and Rescue Units, called Borstar, which deploys \n     emergency medical technicians like Mr. Stroud, to assist \n     people found in desperate condition in the desert.\n       The publicity campaign seems to have had little effect, say \n     border agents and illegal immigrants.\n       Raminez Bermudez, 26, walked for four days in 100-degree \n     heat, and said he knew full well what he was getting into. He \n     had been caught four times before his apprehension this week, \n     he said.\n       Though he has a 25-acre farm in southern Mexico, Mr. \n     Bermudez said he could earn up to $200 a day picking cherries \n     in California. He was distressed, though, at getting caught \n     and at the failure to meet a coyote, or smuggler, who had \n     agreed to pick him up and members of his group for $1,200 \n     each.\n       Mr. Stroud has developed a ritual to cope with the \n     increased number of bodies he has seen among the mesquite \n     bushes and barrel cactus of the Sonoran. He has seen children \n     as young as 10, their bodies bloated after decomposing in the \n     heat, and mothers wailing next to them.\n       ``I say a little prayer for every body,'' he said. ``You \n     try not to let it get to you. But every one of these bodies \n     is somebody's son or daughter, somebody's mother or father.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Times, May 18, 2004]\n\n                            Stealth Amnesty\n\n                       (By Frank J. Gaffney, Jr.)\n\n       The issue that has the potential to be the most volatile \n     politically in the 2004 election is not Iraq, the economy or \n     same-sex marriages. At this writing, it would appear to be \n     the wildly unpopular idea of granting illegal aliens what \n     amounts to amnesty--the opportunity to stay in this country, \n     work, secure social services, become citizens and, in some \n     jurisdictions, perhaps vote even prior to becoming citizens.\n       So radioactive is this idea across party, demographic, \n     class and geographic lines that President Bush has wisely \n     decided effectively to shelve the immigration reform plan he \n     announced with much fanfare earlier this year. With the \n     lowest job approval ratings of his presidency, the last thing \n     he needs is a legislative brawl that will at best fracture, \n     and at worst massively alienate his base.\n       It appears unlikely to help him much with Americans of \n     other stripes, either. Significant numbers of independents \n     and Democrats (although, to be sure, not John Kerry's left-\n     wing constituency)--even Hispanic ones--feel as conservative \n     Republicans do: Rewarding those who violate our immigration \n     statutes is corrosive to the rule of law, on net detrimental \n     to our economy and a serious national security vulnerability.\n       Unfortunately for Mr. Bush, one of his most loyal friends \n     in the U.S. Senate, Republican conservative Larry Craig of \n     Idaho, is poised to saddle the president's re-election bid \n     with just such a divisive initiative: S. 1645, the \n     Agricultural Job Opportunity, Benefits and Security Act of \n     2003 (better known as the AgJobs bill). AgJobs is, in some \n     ways, even worse than the president's plan for temporary \n     workers. While most experts disagree, at least Mr. Bush \n     insists that his initiative will not amount to amnesty for \n     illegal aliens.\n       No such demurral is possible about S. 1645. By the \n     legislation's own terms, an illegal alien will be turned into \n     ``an alien lawfully admitted for temporary residence,'' \n     provided they had managed to work unlawfully in an \n     agricultural job in the United States for a minimum of 100 \n     hours--in other words, for just 2\\1/2\\ workweeks--during the \n     18 months prior to August 31, 2003.\n       Once so transformed, they can stay in the U.S. indefinitely \n     while applying for permanent resident status. From there, it \n     is a matter of time before they can become citizens, so long \n     as they work in the agricultural sector for 675 hours over \n     the next six years.\n       The Craig bill would confer this amnesty not only on \n     farmworking illegal aliens who are in this country--estimates \n     of those eligible run to more than 800,000. It would also \n     extend the opportunity to those who otherwise qualified but \n     had previously left the United States. No one knows how many \n     would fall in this category and want to return as legal \n     workers. But, a safe bet is that there are hundreds of \n     thousands of them.\n       If any were needed, S. 1645 offers a further incentive to \n     the illegals: Your family can stay, as well. Alternatively, \n     if they are not with you, you can bring them in, too--cutting \n     in line ahead of others who made the mistake of abiding by, \n     rather than ignoring, our laws. And just in case the illegal \n     aliens are daunted by the prospect of filling out such \n     paperwork as would be required to effect the changes in \n     status authorized by the AgJobs bill, S. 1645 offers still \n     more: free counsel from, ironically, the bane of \n     conservatives like Sen. Larry Craig and many of his \n     Republican co-sponsors--the highly controversial, leftist and \n     taxpayer-underwritten Legal Services Corp.\n       Needless to say, such provisions seem unlikely to be well-\n     received by the majority of law abiding Americans. Nor, for \n     that matter, do they appear to have much prospect of passage \n     in the less-self-destructive House of Representatives.\n       Yet, if Mr. Craig presses for action on his legislation, \n     the Senate leadership might be unable to spare either \n     President Bush or itself the predictable blow-back: As of \n     today, the Senate Web site indicates the Idahoan has 61 \n     cosponsors, two more than are needed to cut off debate and \n     bring the legislation to a vote; 11 more than would be needed \n     for its passage.\n       In short, thanks to intense pressure from an unusual \n     coalition forged by the agricultural industry and illegal \n     alien advocacy groups, the Senate might endorse the sort of \n     election altering initiative that precipitates voter \n     response--like that made famous by the movie ``Network \n     News'': ``I am mad as hell and I am not going to take it \n     anymore.'' Some, perhaps including the normally shrewd Mr. \n     Craig, may calculate that such voters will have nowhere to go \n     if the alternative to Republican control of the White House \n     and Senate would be Democrats who are, if anything, even less \n     responsible when it comes to amnesty (and social services, \n     voting rights, etc.) for illegal aliens.\n       The truth of the matter, though--as President Bush's \n     political operatives apparently concluded after they trotted \n     out their amnesty-light initiative last January--is voters \n     don't have to vote Democratic to change Washington's \n     political line-up. They just have to stay home on Election \n     Day. And S. 1645 could give them powerful reason to do so.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the New York Times, March 22, 2004]\n\n             In Florida Groves, Cheap Labor Means Machines\n\n                          (By Eduardo Porter)\n\n       Immokalee, Fla.--Chugging down a row of trees, the pair of \n     canopy shakers in Paul Meador's orange grove here seem like a \n     cross between a bulldozer and a hairbrush, their hungry steel \n     bristles working through the tree crowns as if untangling \n     colossal heads of hair.\n       In under 15 minutes, the machines shake loose 36,000 pounds \n     of oranges from 100 trees, catch the fruit and drop it into a \n     large storage car. ``This would have taken four pickers all \n     day long,'' Mr. Meador said.\n       Canopy shakers are still an unusual sight in Florida's \n     orange groves. Most of the crop is harvested by hand, mainly \n     by illegal Mexican immigrants. Nylon sacks slung across their \n     backs, perched atop 16-foot ladders, they pluck oranges at a \n     rate of 70 to 90 cents per 90-pound box, or less than $75 a \n     day.\n       But as globalization creeps into the groves, it is \n     threatening to displace the workers. Facing increased \n     competition from Brazil and a glut of oranges on world \n     markets, alarmed growers here have been turning to labor-\n     saving technology as their best hope for survival.\n       ``The Florida industry has to reduce costs to stay in \n     business,'' said Everett Loukonen, agribusiness manager for \n     the Barron Collier Company, which uses shakers to harvest \n     about half of the 40.5 million pounds of oranges reaped \n     annually from its 10,000 acres in southwestern Florida. \n     ``Mechanical harvesting is the only available way to do that \n     today.''\n       Global competition is pressing American farmers on many \n     fronts. American raisins are facing competition from Chile \n     and Turkey. For fresh tomatoes, the challenge comes from \n     Mexico. China, whose Fuji apples have displaced Washington's \n     Golden Delicious from most Asian markets--and whose apple \n     juice has swamped the United States--is cutting into American \n     farmers' markets for garlic, broccoli and a host of other \n     crops.\n       So even while President Bush advances a plan to invite \n     legal guest workers into American fields, farmers for the \n     first time in a generation are working to replace hand \n     laborers with machines.\n       ``The rest of the world hand-picks everything, but their \n     wage rates are a fraction of ours,'' said Galen Brown, who \n     led the mechanical harvesting program at the Florida \n     Department of Citrus until his retirement last year. Lee \n     Simpson, a raisin grape grower in California's San Joaquin \n     Valley, is more blunt. ``The cheap labor,'' he said, ``isn't \n     cheap enough.''\n       Mr. Simpson and other growers have devised a system that \n     increases yields and cuts the demand for workers during the \n     peak harvest time by 90 percent; rather than cutting grapes \n     by hand and laying them out to dry, the farmers let the fruit \n     dry on the vine before it is harvested mechanically.\n       Some fruit-tree growers in Washington State have introduced \n     a machine that knocks cherries off the tree onto a conveyor \n     belt; they are trying to perfect a similar system for apples. \n     Strawberry growers in Ventura County, Calif., developed a \n     mobile conveyor belt to move full strawberry boxes from the \n     fields to storage bins, cutting demand for workers by a \n     third. And producers of leaf lettuce and spinach for bag \n     mixes have introduced mechanical cutters.\n       American farmers have been dragging machines into their \n     fields at least since the mid-19th century, when labor \n     shortages during the Civil War drove a first wave of \n     mechanical harvesting. Mechanization grew apace for the \n     following 100-plus years, taking over the harvesting of crops \n     including wheat, corn, cotton and sugar cane.\n       But not all crops were easily adaptable to machines. Whole \n     fruit and vegetables--the most lucrative and labor intensive \n     crops, employing four of every five seasonal field workers--\n     require delicate handling. Mechanization sometimes meant \n     rearranging the fields, planting new types of vines or trees \n     and retrofitting packing plants.\n       Rather than make such investments, farmers mostly focused \n     on lobbying government\n\n[[Page S3806]]\n\n     for easier access to inexpensive labor. California growers, \n     the biggest fruit and vegetable producers in the nation, \n     persuaded the government to admit Mexican workers during \n     World War I. Later, from 1942 to 1964, 4.6 million Mexican \n     farm workers were admitted into the country under the bracero \n     guest-worker program.\n       Investment in technology generally happened when the \n     immigrant spigot was shut. After the bracero program ended \n     and some farm wages began to rise, scientists at the \n     University of California at Davis began work on both a \n     machine to harvest tomatoes mechanically and a tomato better \n     suited to mechanical harvesting.\n       By 1970, the number of tomato-harvest jobs had been cut by \n     two-thirds. But the tomato harvester's success proved to be a \n     kiss of death for mechanical harvesting. In 1979, the farm \n     worker advocacy group California Rural Legal Assistance, with \n     support from the United Farm Workers union of Cesar Chavez, \n     sued U.C. Davis, charging that it was using public money for \n     research that displaced workers and helped only big growers.\n       The lawsuit was eventually settled. But even before that, \n     in 1980, President Jimmy Carter's agriculture secretary, Bob \n     Bergland, declared that the government would no longer \n     finance research projects intended to replace ``an adequate \n     and willing work force with machines.'' Today, the \n     Agricultural Research Service employs just one agricultural \n     engineer: Donald Peterson, a longtime researcher at the \n     Appalachian Fruit Research Station in Kearneysville, W. Va.\n       ``At one time I was told to keep a low profile and not to \n     publicize what I was doing,'' Mr. Peterson said.\n       As the government pulled out, growers lost interest as \n     well, refocusing on Congress instead. In 1986, farmers were \n     instrumental in winning passage of the Immigration Reform and \n     Control Act, which legalized nearly three million illegal \n     immigrants--more than a third under a special program for \n     agriculture.\n       Farmers' investments in labor-saving technology all but \n     froze, and gains in labor productivity slowed. From 1986 to \n     1999, farm labor inputs fell 2.4 percent, after a drop of 35 \n     percent in the preceding 14 years. Meanwhile, farmers' \n     capital investments fell 46.7 percent from their peak in 1980 \n     through 1999.\n       About 45 vegetable and fruit crops planted over 3.6 million \n     acres of land, and worth about $13 billion at the farm gate, \n     are still harvested by hand, by a labor force made up mostly \n     of illegal immigrants. On average, farm workers earned $6.18 \n     an hour, less than half the average wage for private, nonfarm \n     workers, in 1998, the year of the Labor Department's most \n     recent survey of agricultural workers.\n       Florida's orange groves have reflected the broader trends. \n     In the 1980's, a 20-year research effort into mechanical \n     harvesting ground to a halt. With frosts upstate taking \n     200,000 acres out of production, orange prices soared and the \n     demand for labor fell.\n       But as is often the case in agriculture, farmers \n     overreacted to the market's strength, flocking to plant \n     groves among the vegetable patches, pastures and swamps in \n     the southwestern part of the state. By the early 1990's, the \n     market looked poised for a glut. With the prospect of bumper \n     crops in Brazil, where harvesting costs are about one-third \n     as high as in Florida, a crisis loomed--driving orange \n     growers back into technology's embrace.\n       In 1995, the growers decided to plow $1 million to $1.5 \n     million a year into research in mechanical harvesting. By the \n     1999-2000 harvest, the growers had achieved their \n     technological breakthrough, with four different harvesting \n     machines working commercially. Last year, machines harvested \n     17,000 acres of the state's 600,000 acres planted in juice \n     oranges, said Fritz M. Roka, an agricultural economist at the \n     University of Florida.\n       ``Mechanical harvesting is the biggest change in the \n     Florida citrus industry since we switched to aluminum \n     ladders,'' said Will Elliott, general manager of Coe-Collier \n     Citrus Harvesting, one of seven commercial contractors that \n     are shaking trunks and brushing canopies around the state.\n       Mr. Brown, the retired Department of Citrus official, \n     estimates that in five years, machines will harvest 100,000 \n     acres of oranges here. But there are obstacles. Machines work \n     best on the big, regularly spaced, groomed young groves in \n     the southwest, and some do not work at all on the smaller, \n     older, more irregular acreage in central Florida. Machines \n     are hard to use on Valencia orange trees, because shaking \n     them risks prematurely dislodging much of the following \n     year's harvest.\n       Still, the economics are in mechanization's favor. A tariff \n     of 29 cents per pound on imports of frozen concentrated \n     orange juice lets Florida growers resist the Brazilian \n     onslaught--but not by much. According to Ronald Muraro and \n     Thomas Spreen, researchers at the University of Florida, \n     Brazil could deliver a pound of frozen concentrate in the \n     United States for under 75 cents, versus 99 cents for a \n     Florida grower.\n       Mechanical harvesting can help cut the gap. Mr. Loukonen of \n     Barron Collier estimates that machine harvesting shaves costs \n     by 8 to 10 cents a pound of frozen concentrate.\n       The spread of mechanization could redraw the profile of \n     Immokalee, which today is a rather typical American farming \n     town. Seventy-one percent of the population of 20,000 is \n     Latino--with much of the balance coming from Haiti--and 46 \n     percent of the residents are foreign born, according to the \n     2000 census. About 40 percent of the residents live under the \n     poverty line, and the median family income is below $23,000--\n     less than half that of the United States as a whole.\n       Philip Martin, an economist at U.C. Davis, points to the \n     poverty as an argument in favor of labor-saving technology. \n     He estimates that about 10 percent of immigrant farm workers \n     leave the fields every year to seek better jobs. Rather than \n     push more farmhands out of work, he contends, introducing \n     machines will simply reduce the demand for new workers to \n     replenish the labor pool.\n       And there are some beneficiaries among workers: those lucky \n     enough to operate the new gear. Perched in the air-\n     conditioned booth of Mr. Meador's canopy shaker, a jumpy \n     ranchera tune crackling from the radio, Felix Real, a former \n     picker, said he can make up to $120 a day driving the \n     contraption down the rows, about twice as much as he used to \n     make.\n       Yet many Immokalee workers are nervous. ``They are using \n     the machines on the good groves and leaving us with the \n     scraggly ones,'' said Venancio Torres, an immigrant from \n     Mexico's coastal state of Veracruz who has been picking \n     oranges in Florida for three years.\n       Mr. Loukonen, the Barron Collier manager, said the farm \n     workers were right to be anxious. ``If there's no demand for \n     labor, supply will end,'' he said. ``They will have to find \n     another place to work, or stay in their country.''\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, our Federal Government has got to do \nbetter, faster, in improving our border security and meeting the \ngrowing problem of illegal immigration.\n  That is why Congress has been beefing up the border patrol and buying \nhigh-tech verification systems for the Department of Homeland Security.\n  That is why, whether you agree on the specific methods or not, the \nHouse of Representatives attached national drivers' license standards \nand asylum changes, in the so-called REAL ID provisions, to the Iraq \nsupplemental appropriations bill.\n  That is why I have supported Senator Byrd on an amendment to this \nbill to increase border security, hire more investigators and \nenforcement agents, and boost resources for detention.\n  That is why I am cosponsoring a bill to help States deal with \nundocumented criminal aliens.\n  And that is why I have worked to bring the AgJOBS--bill the \nAgricultural Job Opportunities, Benefits, and Security Act--to the \nSenate floor.\n  I truly wish we did not have to have this debate on this bill on the \nSenate floor.\n  However, the House of Representatives has forced this opportunity \nupon us. By putting border, identification, and asylum provisions in \nthe supplemental, the House has turned this bill into an immigration \nbill.\n  I am committed to making this debate as brief as possible, and as \nfull and fair as necessary. As far as I am concerned, a thorough debate \non AgJOBS does not need to take more than a couple hours, if we can get \nagreement from Senators who oppose the amendment.\n  The Senate has enough time for this amendment. If anyone is going to \nunduly delay this bill, it is not this Senator. As a member of the \nAppropriations Committee and on this floor, I fully support prompt \nappropriations for our men and women in uniform and for operations \nnecessary in the war on terrorism.\n  AgJOBS is only an installment toward an overall solution to our \nnation's growing problem of illegal immigration. However, it is a \nsignificant installment, a logical installment, and one that is fully \nmatured and ready to go forward.\n  I have worked with my colleagues and numerous communities of interest \non AgJOBS issues for several years. The amendment I bring forward this \nweek has been, in all its major essentials, well-known and much \ndiscussed in the Senate and the House for more than a year and a half.\n  This bipartisan effort builds upon years of discussion and \nsuggestions among growers, farm worker advocates, Latino and \nimmigration issue advocates, Members of both parties in both Houses of \nCongress, and others.\n  We have now built the largest bipartisan coalition ever for a single \nimmigration bill. This letter was just delivered this week to Senate \noffices. There are about 100 more signatures on this letter than a \nsimilar letter delivered a year ago. Support for AgJOBS is growing.\n  That support reflects the fact that, in agriculture as in other \nsectors, the current immigration and labor market system is profoundly \nbroken.\n\n[[Page S3807]]\n\n  An enforcement-only policy is not the answer and doesn't work.\n  The United States has 7,458 miles of land borders and 88,600 miles of \ntidal shoreline. We can secure those frontiers well but not perfectly. \nAs we have stepped up border enforcement, we have locked undocumented \nimmigrants in this country at least as effectively as we have locked \nany out.\n  With an estimated 10 million undocumented persons in the United \nStates, to find them and flush them out of homes, schools, churches, \nand work places would mean an intrusion on the civil liberties of \nAmericans that they will not tolerate. We fought our revolution, in \npart, over troops at our doors and in our homes.\n  History has shown us what does work: A coupling of more secure \nborders, better internal enforcement, and a guest worker program that \nfaces up to economic reality.\n  The only experience our country has had with a legal farm guest \nworker program--used widely in the 1950s but repealed in the 1960s--\ntaught us conclusive lessons. While it was criticized on other grounds, \nthat program dramatically reduced illegal immigration from high levels \nto almost nothing, while meeting labor market needs.\n  AgJOBS is a groundbreaking, necessary part of this balanced, \nrealistic approach. American agriculture has boldly stepped forward and \nadmitted the problem. AgJOBS is a critical part of the solution.\n  Agriculture is the sector of the economy for which the problem is the \nworst. Fifty to 75 percent of farm workers are undocumented. As \ninternal enforcement has stepped up, family farms are going out of \nbusiness because they cannot find legal workers.\n  This mighty machine we call American agriculture is on a dangerous \nprecipice--perhaps the most dangerous in our history. This year, for \nthe first time since records have been kept, the United States is on \nthe verge of becoming a net importer of agricultural products.\n  To keep American-grown food on our families' tables, we need a \nstable, legal, labor supply. To keep suppliers, processors, and other \nrural jobs alive, American agriculture needs a stable, legal, labor \nsupply. It has been said, foreign workers are going to harvest our \nfood; the only question is whether they do it here or in another \ncountry.\n  Whatever the case is in other industries, in agriculture, we really \nare talking about jobs that Americans can't or won't take. This \nphysically demanding labor is seasonal and migrant in nature. Few \nAmericans can or will leave home and family behind, to travel from \nState to State, crop to crop, for only part of the year, living in \ntemporary structures. The planting, growing, and harvesting seasons \noccur at different times in different States--usually when students are \nnot available.\n  AgJOBS is also part of a humane solution. Legal workers can demand a \nliving wage and assert legal rights that undocumented workers--smuggled \ninto the country and kept ``underground''--cannot. Every year, more \nthan 300 persons die in the desert, the boxcar, or the back of a truck \ntrailer. For a civilized, humane country, that is intolerable.\n  For the long term, AgJOBS reforms and streamlines the profoundly \nbroken H-2A program that is supposed to provide legal, farm guest \nworkers. It is now so bureaucratic and burdensome, it admits only about \n40,000 workers a year--2 to 3 percent of farm workers.\n  However, we cannot expand the H-2A program overnight. A system of \nconsulate system, a Homeland Security bureaucracy, and a Department of \nLabor bureaucracy that, today, chokes on processing 40,000 workers a \nyear will need several years to ramp up to several times that amount. \nGrowers, almost all of which do not use H-2A today, will need time to \nget into the system. Also, growers will need time to build housing and \nprepare for the other labor standards that H-2A has always required to \nprevent foreign workers from taking jobs from Americans.\n  As a bridge to stabilize the workforce while H-2A reforms are being \nimplemented, AgJOBS includes a one-time-only earned adjustment program, \nto let about 500,000 trusted farm workers, with a proven, substantial \nwork history here, continue working here, legally. The permanent H-2A \nreforms would make future farm worker adjustments unnecessary.\n  AgJOBS is not amnesty or a reward for illegal behavior.\n  Requiring several years of demanding, physical labor in the fields is \nan opportunity to rehabilitate to legal status--to earn the adjustment \nto legal status.\n  Adjusting AgJOBS workers would have to meet a higher standard of good \nbehavior than other, legal immigrants, in the future. Once a worker is \nin the adjustment program, he or she has to obey all the laws that \nother, legal immigrants have to. In addition, an adjusting worker would \nbe deported for conviction of one felony; or three misdemeanors, \nhowever minor; or, in the amendment before, a single serious \nmisdemeanor, defined as an offense that results in 6 months of jail \ntime.\n  Part of earning adjustment involves the immigrant surrendering to \nsome limits on his or her legal rights--including a substantial \nprospective work requirement in agriculture and meeting a higher legal \nstandard of good behavior than other, legal immigrants.\n  The adjusting worker can apply for permanent residence--a green \ncard--at the end of the adjustment process. As a practical matter, \nobtaining a green card would take about 6 to 9 years after the worker \nenters the adjustment process. For the work involved, the economic \ncontributions made, and the diligence required over a long period of \ntime, this is fair. Sharing the American dream with persons who want to \nbe--and will be--law-abiding members of the community, is fair.\n  AgJOBS workers, both adjusting and H-2A, would be free to leave the \ncountry at the end of the work season and not be ``locked in'' the \ncountry, between jobs.\n  Finally, AgJOBS is good for our homeland security.\n  With background checks, AgJOBS would let American families know who \nis putting the food on our tables. That means ensuring a safe and \nstable food supply for American families.\n  When we stop sending investigators and enforcement agents into the \npotato fields and apple orchards, we will be able to devote critical \nresources where they belong--hunting down real criminals and stopping \nterrorists.\n  AgJOBS is a win-win-win, for growers, workers, taxpayers, and \nhomeland security. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I also ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record several \ndocuments setting out facts about AgJOBS, the need for AgJOBS, \nfrequently asked questions, and letters of endorsement from the New \nEngland Apple Council, Americans for Tax Reform, and from former U.S. \nTrade Representative and Secretary of Agriculture, Clayton Yeutter.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           Facts About AgJOBS\n\n\n the Agricultural Job Opportunity, Benefits, and Security Act of 2005--\n                            S. 359/H.R. 884\n\n       The Problem: Some 50 to 75 percent of America's farm work \n     force is undocumented. As border and internal enforcement \n     improves, work force disruptions are increasing and some \n     operations are simply shutting down because growers cannot \n     find a reliable, legal labor supply. This comes at a time \n     when American agriculture is in perhaps its most precarious \n     condition in our history, and we are on the verge of \n     importing more food than we grow, for the first time since \n     records have been kept.\n       Long-Term Solution: A permanently reformed H-2A program \n     would be streamlined, easier to use, and more economical, \n     providing a legal work force for farm jobs Americans won't \n     take. Legal guest workers would go back to their home \n     countries when the work season is over. The current H-2A \n     system is profoundly broken and supplies only 2 to 3 percent \n     of farm workers (30,000 to 40,000 a year out of a work force \n     of 1.6 million).\n       Short-Term ``Bridge'': A one-time-only earned adjustment \n     program would allow growers to retain trusted, tax-paying \n     employees with a proven work history, to stabilize the ag \n     work force as the industry (and the government bureaucracy) \n     transitions to greater use of a reformed H-2A program. Based \n     on DOL statistics, about 500,000 workers would be eligible to \n     apply.\n       Rehabilitation, not ``amnesty'': A significant prospective \n     work requirement (at least 360 days over 3 to 6 years, \n     including at least 240 days in the first 3 years) in \n     agriculture--among the most physically demanding work in the \n     country--means adjusting workers could earn the right to stay \n     and work toward legal status. Adjusting workers would have to \n     meet a higher standard of good behavior than other, legal \n     immigrants, being subject to deportation for any 3 \n     misdemeanors, regardless how minor.\n\n[[Page S3808]]\n\n       Good for homeland security: Hundreds of thousands of \n     undocumented workers would be brought out of the shadows and \n     given background checks. DHS could re-focus more resources on \n     fighting more dangerous threats.\n       Good for American consumers: American families would be \n     more certain of a safe, stable, food supply grown in America, \n     and we would know who is growing our food.\n       Not a ``magnet'' for new illegal immigration: Only workers \n     with a substantial, proven work history (at least 100 days) \n     in agriculture in the USA before January 1, 2005, would be \n     eligible to apply for the earned adjustment program.\n       Not ``taking jobs away'' from American workers: H-2A labor \n     standards (including wages, housing, and transportation) \n     ensure that American workers are not ``underbid'' for H-2A \n     jobs. Whatever arguments some may make about other \n     industries, most of the work in labor-intensive agriculture \n     is seasonal and migrant in nature. Most American workers \n     cannot and will not leave their families and homes behind, to \n     move from farm to farm, living in temporary quarters, \n     following temporary work.\n       Humane, good for workers: It is intolerable that, every \n     year, hundreds of workers die packed in boxcars or truck \n     trailers or crossing the desert. Many thousands are preyed \n     upon by human smugglers. Stepped-up border enforcement has \n     locked in as many as it has locked out, as returning home at \n     the end of the work season becomes as treacherous and deadly \n     as entering the country. Workers with legal status can assert \n     legal rights against exploitation and safely leave the \n     country when the work is done.\n\n                  The Need for AgJOBS Legislation--Now\n\n       Americans need and expect a stable predictable, legal work \n     force in American agriculture. Willing American workers \n     deserve a system that puts them first in line for available \n     jobs with fair, market wages. All workers deserve decent \n     treatment and protection of basic rights under the law. \n     Consumers deserve a safe, stable, domestic food supply. \n     American citizens and taxpayers deserve secure borders, a \n     safe homeland, and a government that works. Yet we are being \n     threatened on all these fronts, because of a growing shortage \n     of legal workers in agriculture.\n       To address these challenges, a bipartisan group of Members \n     of Congress, including Senators Larry Craig (ID) and Ted \n     Kennedy (MA) and Representative Chris Cannon (UT) and Howard \n     Berman (CA), is introducing the Agricultural Job Opportunity, \n     Benefits, and Security (AgJOBS) Act of 2005. This bipartisan \n     effort builds upon years of discussion and suggestions among \n     growers, farm worker advocates, Latino and immigration issue \n     advocates, Members of both parties in both Houses of \n     Congress, and others. In all substantive essentials, this \n     bill is the same as S. 1645/H.R. 3142 in the 108th Congress.\n\n\n                              THE PROBLEMS\n\n       Of the USA's 1.6 million agricultural work force, more than \n     half is made up of workers not legally authorized to work \n     here--according to a conservative estimate by the Department \n     of Labor, based, astoundingly, on self-disclosure in worker \n     surveys. Reasonable private sector estimates run to 75 \n     percent or more.\n       With stepped up documentation enforcement by the Social \n     Security Administration and the Bureau of Immigration and \n     Customs Enforcement (the successor to the old INS), persons \n     working here without legal documentation are not leaving the \n     country, but just being scattered. The work force is being \n     constantly and increasingly disrupted. Ag employers want a \n     legal work force and must have a stable work force to \n     survive--but federal law actually punishes ``too much \n     diligence'' in checking worker documentation. Some growers \n     already have gone out of business, lacking workers to work \n     their crops at critical times.\n       Undocumented workers are among the most vulnerable persons \n     in our country, and know they must live in hiding, not \n     attract attention at work, and move furtively. They cannot \n     claim the most basic legal rights and protections. They are \n     vulnerable to predation and exploitation. Many have paid \n     ``coyotes''--labor smugglers--thousands of dollars to be \n     transported into and around this country, often under \n     inhumane and perilous conditions. Reports continue to mount \n     of horrible deaths suffered by workers smuggled in enclosed \n     truck trailers.\n       Meanwhile, the only program currently in place to respond \n     to such needs, the H-2A legal guest worker program, is \n     profoundly broken. The H-2A status quo is slow, bureaucratic, \n     and inflexible. The program is complicated and legalistic. \n     DOL's compliance manual alone is over 300 pages. The current \n     H-2A process is so expensive and hard to use, it places only \n     about 30,000-50,000 legal guest workers a year--2 percent to \n     3 percent of the total ag work force. A General Accounting \n     Office study found DOL missing statutory deadlines for \n     processing employer applications to participate in H-2A more \n     than 40% percent of the time. Worker advocates have expressed \n     concerns that enforcement is inadequate.\n\n\n                      THE SOLUTION--AGJOBS REFOrms\n\n       AgJOBS legislation provides a two-step approach to a \n     stable, legal, safe, ag work force: (1) Streamlining and \n     expanding the H-2A legal, temporary, guest worker program, \n     and making it more affordable and used more--the long-term \n     solution, which will take time to implement; (2) Outside the \n     H-2A program, a one-time adjustment to legal status for \n     experienced farm workers already working here, who currently \n     lack legal documentation--the bridge to allow American \n     agriculture to adjust to a changing economy.\n       H-2A Reforms: Currently, when enough domestic farm workers \n     are not available for upcoming work, growers are required to \n     go through a lengthy, complicated, expensive, and uncertain \n     process of demonstrating that fact to the satisfaction of the \n     federal government. They are then allowed to arrange for the \n     hiring of legal, temporary, nonimmigrant guest workers. These \n     guest workers are registered with the U.S. Government to work \n     with specific employers and return to their home countries \n     when the work is done. Needed reforms would:\n       Replace the current quagmire for qualifying employers and \n     prospective workers with a streamlined ``attestation'' \n     process like the one now used for H-1B high-tech workers, \n     speeding up certification of H-2A employers and the hiring of \n     legal guest workers.\n       Participating employers would continue to provide for the \n     housing and transportation needs of H-2A workers. New \n     adjustments to the Adverse Effect Wage Rate would be \n     suspended during a 3-year period pending extensive study of \n     its impact and alternatives. Other current H-2A labor \n     protections for both H-2A and domestic workers would be \n     continued. H-2A workers would have new rights to seek redress \n     through mediation and federal court enforcement of specific \n     rights. Growers would be protected from frivolous claims, \n     exorbitant damages, and duplicative contract claims in state \n     courts.\n       The only experience our country has had with a broadly-used \n     farm guest worker program (used widely in the 1950s but \n     repealed in the 1960s) demonstrated conclusive, and \n     instructive, results. While it was criticized on other \n     grounds, it dramatically reduced illegal immigration while \n     meeting labor market needs.\n     Adjustment of workers to legal status\n       To provide a ``bridge'' to stabilize the ag work force \n     while H-2A reforms are being implemented, AgJOBS would create \n     a new earned adjustment program, in which farm workers \n     already here, but working without legal authorization, could \n     earn adjustment to legal status. To qualify, an incumbent \n     worker must have worked in the United States in agriculture, \n     before January 1, 2005, for at least 100 days in a 12-month \n     period over the last 18 months prior to the bill's \n     introduction. (The average migrant farm worker works 120 days \n     a year.)\n       This would not spur new immigration, because adjustment \n     would be limited to incumbent, trusted farm workers with a \n     significant work history in U.S. agriculture. The adjusting \n     worker would have non-immigrant, but legal, status. \n     Adjustment would not be complete until a worker completes a \n     substantial work requirement in agriculture (at least 360 \n     days over the next 3-6 years, including 240 days in the first \n     3 years).\n       Approximately 500,000 workers would be eligible to apply \n     (based on current workforce estimates). Their spouses and \n     minor children would be given limited rights to stay in the \n     U.S., protected from deportation. The worker would have to \n     verify compliance with the law and continue to report his or \n     her work history to the government. Upon completion of \n     adjustment, the worker would be eligible for legal permanent \n     resident status. Considering the time elapsed from when a \n     worker first applies to enter the adjustment process, this \n     gives adjusting workers no advantage over regular immigrants \n     beginning the legal immigration process at the same time.\n       AgJOBS would not create an amnestv program. Neither would \n     it require anything unduly onerous of workers. Eligible \n     workers who are already in the United States could continue \n     to work in agriculture, but now could do so legally, and \n     prospectively earn adjustment to legal status. Adjusting \n     workers may also work in another industry, as long as the \n     agriculture work requirement is satisfied.\n\n\n                    agjobs is a win-win-win approach\n\n       Workers would be better off than under the status quo. \n     Legal guest workers in the H-2A program need the assurance \n     that government red tape won't eliminate their jobs. For \n     workers not now in the H-2A program, every farmworker who \n     gains legal status finally will be able to assert legal \n     protection--which leads to higher wages, better working \n     conditions, and safer travel. Growers and workers would get a \n     stable, legal work force. Consumers would get better \n     assurance of a safe, stable, American-grown, food supply--not \n     an increased dependence on imported food. Law-abiding \n     Americans want to make sure the legal right to stay in our \n     country is earned, and that illegal behavior is not rewarded \n     now or encouraged in the future. Border and homeland security \n     would be improved by bringing workers out of the underground \n     economy and registering them with the AgJOBS adjustment \n     program. Overall, AgJOBS takes a balanced approach, and would \n     work to benefit everyone.\n\n       Frequently Asked Questions on Agjobs and Earned Adjustment\n\n       Q. Amnesty doesn't work. Why try it again?\n       A. Amnesty doesn't work. That's why I never have supported \n     it. The country has tried amnesty in the past and it's \n     failed. Our current immigration law is flawed and enforcement \n     has been a miserable failure. The government has pretended to \n     control the borders while the country has looked the\n\n[[Page S3809]]\n\n     other way and ignored the problem. That's precisely why we \n     need to try a new, innovative approach like AgJOBS.\n       Q. How can you justify rewarding people who came here \n     illegally by allowing them to become legal?\n       A. The only workers who apply for the adjustment program \n     will be those who want to become law-abiding in every \n     respect. They will have to register with the government and \n     verify their continued employment. Their adjustment to legal \n     status will be complete only after they earn it with \n     continued, demanding labor in agriculture for the next 3-6 \n     years. If an adjusting worker breaks other laws, he or she is \n     out. The Adjustment Program would be there to benefit hard-\n     working, known, trusted farm workers who did and will obey \n     our laws in every other way. This is not a reward, but \n     rehabilitation.\n       Q. Won't the promise of status adjustment encourage more \n     illegal immigration?\n       A. Not in our AgJOBS bill. If someone wants to enter the \n     United States to take advantage of our bill, they are already \n     too late. To begin applying for adjustment, the worker must \n     have been here before January 1, 2005--3 weeks before the \n     bill was introduced--with a substantial record of work in \n     agriculture. We are talking about stabilizing the current \n     farm work force--working with persons who already are here.\n       Q. Why should agriculture get this special treatment?\n       A. That's the sector of our economy most impacted by \n     illegal immigration. The crisis in agriculture must be \n     addressed immediately--and it took us years just to get \n     agreement between growers and labor, between key Republicans \n     and Democrats, on this new approach. If AgJOBS works--and I \n     believe it will--it will help us figure out how to solve the \n     much bigger problem of an estimated million illegal aliens in \n     this country.\n       Q. Illegal aliens have broken the law. Why not just round \n     them up and deport them?\n       A. (1) We can't, as a practical matter. The official 2000 \n     Census estimated that there are more than 8.7 million illegal \n     aliens in the U.S. There are more today. That's the \n     consequence of looking the other way for decades. Finding and \n     forcibly removing all of them would make the War on Terrorism \n     look cheap and would disrupt communities and work places to \n     an extent most Americans simply wouldn't tolerate. If a law \n     has failed, you can ignore it or fix it. Looking the other \n     way only encourages more disrespect for the law. We need a \n     new, innovative solution. AgJOBS is the pilot program.\n       (2) Up to 85 percent of all farm workers are here \n     illegally. If we could round up and deport every illegal farm \n     worker, that would be pretty much the end of American \n     agriculture--the end of our safe, secure, home-grown food \n     supply. That's how I first got involved in this issue, \n     because agriculture is critical to the economy of Idaho--and \n     the nation. We need to bring these workers out of the \n     shadows, out of the underground economy, and turn them into \n     law-abiding workers.\n       Q. Won't more illegals to sneak across the border, claim \n     they were already here as farm workers, and abuse this new \n     program?\n       A. Unlike the 1986 program--which was amnesty and was very \n     different--our bill requires workers to provide documentary \n     proof that they already were established here as farm \n     workers--for example, tax records or employers' records.\n       Q. Once this wave of ``adjusting workers'' settle in, \n     what's to prevent the demand for ANOTHER amnesty program in a \n     few years?\n       A. Our bill would help stabilize the farm work force in the \n     short term so that American farmers can adjust to the economy \n     of the 21st Century for the long term. The Adjustment Program \n     would give us the time we need to reform and significantly \n     grow the other program in the bill, the H-2A Program, which \n     employs legal, temporary ``guest workers'' who enter the U.S. \n     only under government supervision and leave when the work is \n     done. Because the H-2A Program has been broken for decades, \n     there's been no effective vehicle for workers to come here \n     legally to work in agriculture when domestic workers aren't \n     available.\n       Q. Aren't these illegals stealing jobs from Americans?\n       A. I hear about that in other industries. I don't know that \n     I've ever received one complaint from an American citizen who \n     wanted to do the physically demanding labor of a migrant farm \n     worker and felt an illegal alien had kept him or her out of \n     that job. But I have heard from farmers who have gone out of \n     business because they couldn't find a legal work force. This \n     is why many of our legal visa programs are industry-\n     specific--because the economy and labor markets are different \n     for different industries. This is precisely the reason to try \n     the AgJOBS solution in agriculture.\n       Q. How will this bill help us control our borders?\n       A. We can't possibly seal off thousands of miles of borders \n     and coastlines. But we can control them better and improve \n     our homeland security. Thousands of AgJOBS workers would be \n     registered with, and in a job program supervised by, the \n     Federal Government. This would be a major step forward toward \n     a longer-term, more comprehensive solution.\n       Q. Who's going to pay for the medical bills and social \n     services for adjusting workers?\n       A. Remember, in the AgJOBS Adjustment Program, we are \n     talking only about workers who already are here, with \n     substantial jobs in agriculture. So, AgJOBS does not add one \n     bit to this burden. In fact, if anything, it starts helping \n     to provide relief. When these workers gain legal status, they \n     will be in a better position to earn more and do more to \n     provide for themselves than they can today.\n\n\n                               New England Apple Council Inc.,\n\n                                                   April 18, 2005.\n     Hon. Senator Craig,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Craig: The New England Apple Council was \n     formed more than 35 years ago, at the end of the Bracero \n     program. Our 185 growers, me included, have used H2A workers \n     or workers under previous programs for more than 50 years. \n     The first foreign workers to come to New England to harvest \n     crops were in 1943. Over the last decade we have been \n     struggling to keep the H2A program working. I don't need to \n     tell you the program is broken and in order for our growers \n     to keep a legal workforce the program needs fixing.\n       I listened to Senators Sessions and Byrd speaking against \n     Ag-Jobs on Friday and was extremely disturbed by what they \n     were saying. They read from letters sent by a few \n     associations and agents who are opposed to Ag-Jobs. The \n     growers using the H2A program ARE IN FAVOR OF AG-JOBS!! Some \n     associations and agents are not. Why? Because if we reform \n     H2A so that it really works many growers will be able to use \n     it without an association or agent. That's what H2A reform is \n     all about, and we are in favor of it!! Workers who have held \n     H2A jobs and meet the required days of employment will be \n     rewarded for playing by the rules. Senator Sessions stated \n     Friday that ``only people who break the law will be \n     rewarded'', that is not true!! We have many workers who for \n     many years, some since before 1986, have been coming yearly \n     and going home at the end of their contract. Nationwide \n     between 7 and 10% of the adjusting workers will be those H2A \n     workers who have obeyed the law, and they will finally be \n     rewarded. Some agents and some associations see that as a bad \n     move, which will cause disruption in the workforce, most \n     growers say it's time to reward those workers who have obeyed \n     the law.\n       As a longtime user of H2A workers and Executive Director of \n     New England Apple Council and past President of the National \n     Council of Agricultural employers I believe I have the feel \n     of most agricultural employers in the United States. They are \n     overwhelmingly in favor of Ag-Jobs. The Jamaica Central \n     Labour Organization, which supplies most of the H2A workers \n     to employers in the Northeast, is in favor of Ag-Jobs. The \n     Association of Employers of Jamaican Workers, which I am \n     Chairman of, supports Ag-Jobs. And lastly the 520 \n     Organizations who signed the letter to congress sent on April \n     11th. Support Ag-Jobs. Please tell the Senate that an \n     overwhelming number of the U.S. employers of H2A labor \n     support Ag-Jobs.\n       Thank you for your support on this very difficult issue.\n       Sincerely,\n     John Young.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     Americans for Tax Reform,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 12, 2005.\n     Hon. Larry Craig,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Chris Cannon,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Craig and Congressman Cannon: I would like to \n     take this opportunity to commend you for the introduction of \n     S. 1645 and H.R. 3142, ``The Agricultural Job Opportunity, \n     Benefits, and Security Act of 2005.'' The ``AgJobs'' bill is \n     a great first step in bringing fundamental reform to our \n     nation's broken immigration system.\n       AgJobs would make America more secure. 50 to 75 percent of \n     the agricultural workforce in this country is underground due \n     to highly-impractical worker quota restrictions. Up to \n     500,000 workers would be given approved worker status, \n     screened by the Department of Homeland Security, and \n     accounted for while they are here. Any future workers coming \n     into America looking for agricultural work would be screened \n     at the border, where malcontents can most easily be turned \n     back.\n       The current H-2A agricultural worker program only supplies \n     about 2-3 percent of the farm workforce. That means that the \n     great majority of workers who pick our fruit and vegetables \n     have never been through security screening. In a post-9/ll \n     world, this is simply intolerable. Workers that are here to \n     work in jobs native-born Americans are not willing to do must \n     stay if food production is to remain adequate. However, those \n     already here and new workers from overseas should have a \n     screening system that works, both for our safety and for \n     their human rights. Your bill does just that.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Grover G. Norquist,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                      Potomac, MD, April 13, 2005.\n     Hon. Larry Craig,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Craig: History demonstrates that there are \n     moments in time when special opportunities arise for \n     political action that successfully addresses multiple \n     challenges. Today is one of those occasions. The opportunity \n     is Senator Larry Craig's AgJobs bill, S. 359.\n       News headlines are alerting American voters of concerns \n     about our trade deficit,\n\n[[Page S3810]]\n\n     American jobs lost to off-shore competition, long-term \n     funding of the Social Security system, and a seemingly \n     irreversible pattern of increasing illegal immigration. A \n     significant opportunity for political action that begins to \n     address all of these challenges is within reach.\n       That opportunity, if taken, will strengthen American labor-\n     intensive agriculture and ensure its future role as a major \n     U.S. export industry. A growing agriculture sector will keep \n     jobs in America, because studies show that every laborer in \n     production agriculture generates 3.5 additional jobs in \n     related businesses. The workers in all these jobs will be \n     participants in the Social Security system that is dependent \n     upon a large workforce. Perhaps most significantly, reputable \n     studies confirm that the best solution for stemming the tide \n     of illegal immigration is guest worker programs that \n     function.\n       Government statistics and other evidence suggest that at \n     least 50 percent and perhaps 70 percent of the current \n     agricultural workforce is not in this country legally. The \n     immediate reaction of some is to say that these workers have \n     broken the law and should be deported, and that U.S. farmers \n     would not have a labor problem if wages were increased.\n       That ``easy'' answer ignores the reality that few Americans \n     are drawn to highly seasonal and physically demanding work in \n     agriculture. At chaotic harvest times, a stable, dependable \n     workforce is essential. My experience over many years tells \n     me that agricultural employers do not want to hire illegal \n     immigrants. What they want is a stable, viable program with \n     integrity that will meet their labor force needs in a timely, \n     effective way. What they do not want is a program with major \n     shortcomings, for which they will inevitably be blamed. \n     Unfortunately, that is what our laws have imposed upon them.\n       As a Nation, we can and must do better--for agricultural \n     employers, for immigrant workers, and as insurance to secure \n     a strong agriculture business sector. Many of these workers \n     have come to the U.S. on a regular basis. Many have lived \n     here for years doing our toughest jobs, and some would like \n     to earn the privilege of living here permanently. Why not \n     permit them to do so, over a specified timeframe, thereby \n     keeping the best workers here? That has the additional \n     advantage of permitting our government to better focus its \n     limited monitoring/enforcement resources, particularly where \n     security may be a concern. Let's use entry/exit tracking, \n     tamper proof documentation, biometric identification, etc. \n     where it will truly pay security dividends, and let's stop \n     painting all immigrants with the same brush.\n       A limited, earned legalization for agriculture is nothing \n     like an amnesty program. It would apply only to immigrants \n     who are at work, paying taxes, and are willing to earn their \n     way to citizenship so that they too can share in the American \n     dream. These workers form the foundation of much of our \n     Nation's agricultural workforce. We need them!\n       Agricultural employers need an updated guest work program \n     to replace the antiquated ``H2A'' temporary worker system, \n     which is too expensive and too bureaucratic to be of \n     practical use. Necessary reforms include fair and stronger \n     security and identification measures, market-based wage \n     rates, and comprehensive application procedures.\n       The reform program I have outlined already has broad \n     bipartisan support, thanks to the good work and leadership of \n     Senators Larry Craig and Ted Kennedy, among others, and a \n     bipartisan group of House colleagues. Their approach deserves \n     immediate and serious consideration by the Senate. The status \n     quo is simply unacceptable. The reforms now being proposed \n     are a practical solution to a serious problem that is a \n     genuine threat to the future of American agriculture.\n       As President Bush has stated, we can and must do better to \n     match a willing and hardworking immigrant worker with \n     producers who are in desperate need of a lawful workforce. It \n     is in our great country's interest to enact these reforms and \n     reap the harvest of political action at a special moment in \n     time.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              Clayton Yeutter,\n\n                               Former Secretary of Agriculture and\n     Former U.S. Trade Representative.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   April 11, 2005.\n       Dear Member of Congress: The undersigned organizations and \n     individuals, representing a broad cross-section of America, \n     join together to ask you to support enactment of S. 359 and \n     H.R. 884, the Agricultural Job Opportunities, Benefits and \n     Security Act of 2005 (AgJOBS). This landmark bipartisan \n     legislation would achieve historic reforms to our nation's \n     labor and immigration laws as they pertain to agriculture. \n     The legislation reflects years of negotiations on complex and \n     contentious issues among employer and worker representatives \n     and leaders in Congress.\n       A growing number of our leaders in Congress, as well as the \n     President, recognize that our nation's immigration policy is \n     flawed and that, from virtually every perspective, the status \n     quo is untenable. America needs reforms that are \n     compassionate, realistic and economically sensible--reforms \n     that also enhance the rule of law and contribute to national \n     security. AgJOBS represents the coming together of historic \n     adversaries in a rare opportunity to achieve reforms \n     supportive of these goals, as well as our nation's \n     agricultural productivity and food security.\n       AgJOBS represents a balanced solution for American \n     agriculture, a critical element of a comprehensive solution, \n     and one that can be enacted now with broad bipartisan \n     support. For these reasons, we join together to encourage the \n     Congress to enact promptly S. 359 and H.R. 884, the \n     Agricultural Job Opportunities, Benefits, and Security Act of \n     2005.\n       Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

(a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following \n     findings--\n       Whereas, on February 1, 2005, Nepal's King Gyanendra \n     dissolved the multi-party government, suspended \n     constitutional liberties, and arrested political party \n     leaders, human rights activists and representatives of civil \n     society organizations.\n       Whereas, despite condemnation of the King's actions and the \n     suspension of military aid to Nepal by India and Great \n     Britain, and similar steps by the United States, the King has \n     refused to restore constitutional liberties and democracy.\n       Whereas, there are concerns that the King's actions will \n     strengthen Nepal's Maoist insurgency.\n       Whereas, while some political leaders have been released \n     from custody, there have been new arrests of human rights \n     activists and representatives of other civil society \n     organizations.\n       Whereas, the King has thwarted efforts of member of the \n     National Human Rights Commission to conduct monitoring \n     activities, but recently agreed to permit the United Nations \n     High Commissioners for Human Rights to open an office in \n     Katmandu to monitor and investigate violations.\n       Whereas, the Maoists have committed atrocities against \n     civilians and poses a threat to democracy in Nepal.\n       Whereas, the Nepalese Army has also committed gross \n     violations of human rights.\n       Whereas, King Gyanendra has said that he intends to pursue \n     a military strategy against the Maoists.\n       Whereas, Nepal needs an effective military strategy to \n     counter the Maoists and pressure them to negotiate an end to \n     the conflict, but such a strategy must include the Nepalese \n     Army's respect for the human rights and dignity of the \n     Nepalese people.\n       Whereas, an effective strategy to counter the Maoists also \n     requires a political process that is inclusive and democratic \n     in which constitutional rights are protected, and government \n     policies that improve the lives of the Nepalese people.\n       (b) Whereas, now therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the Sense of the Senate that King \n     Gyanendra should immediately release all political detainees, \n     restore constitutional liberties, and undertake good faith \n     negotiations with the leaders of Nepal's political parties to \n     restore democracy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as we are in the midst of this important \ndebate on the war supplemental, immigration, and other pressing issues, \nall over America things are happening that don't always make it to this \nfloor.\n  This week in my State and in my home city, where I was born, Atlanta, \nGA, there will be a retirement. Mr. Mark Fitzgerald will retire from \nhis years of service with the Home Builders Association of Metropolitan \nAtlanta, an association he has built to become one of the largest in \nthe United States of America. He will be honored. There will be \ntestimonials. There will be gifts. But the greatest gift is the service \nhe and his association have given to the economy of our State, for the \nbetterment of our State, and in the entrepreneurship and freedom that \nwe all love in this great country of ours.\n  So I want to pause this moment and let the Record of the Senate \nreflect that this week, as we debate the issues of the day, all over \nAmerica there are those who have given their lives in service to their \ncountry through the free enterprise system.\n  Today and this week, in Georgia, one Mark Fitzgerald is one who will \nbe honored. I commend him for his service, his commitment, and his \ncitizenship in this great country and in our home State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/18/senate-section/article/S3812-3", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3812-S3813]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CAMERAS IN THE COURTROOM\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am proud to once again support the \nGrassley-Schumer bill on cameras in the courtroom. This proposal was \nreported by the Judiciary Committee on a bipartisan vote in the last \ntwo congresses, and I very much hope we can get it signed into law this \nyear.\n  When the workings of Government are transparent, the people \nunderstand their Government better and can more constructively \nparticipate in it. They can also more easily hold their public \nofficials accountable. I believe this principle can and should be \napplied to the judicial as well as the legislative and executive \nbranches of Government, while still respecting the unique role of the \nFederal judiciary.\n  We have a long tradition of press access to trials, but in this day \nand age, it is no longer sufficient to read in the morning paper what \nhappened in a trial the day before. The public wants to see for itself \nwhat goes on in our courts of law and I think it should be allowed to \ndo so.\n  Concerns about cameras interfering with the fair administration of \njustice in this county are, I believe, overstated. Experience in the \nState courts--and the vast majority of States now allow trials to be \ntelevised--has shown that it is possible to permit the public to see \ntrials on television without compromising the defendant's right to a \nfair trial or the safety or privacy interests of witnesses and jurors.\n\n[[Page S3813]]\n\nThere is no question in my mind that the highly trained judges and \nlawyers who sit on and argue before our Nation's Federal appellate \ncourts would continue to conduct themselves with dignity and \nprofessionalism if cameras were recording their work.\n  Let me note also that I believe the arguments against allowing \ncameras in the courtroom are least persuasive in the case of appellate \nproceedings, including the Supreme Court. In fact, I had the \nopportunity to watch the oral argument when the Supreme Court \nconsidered the constitutionality of the McCain-Feingold bill in 2003. \nIt was a fascinating experience, and one that I wish all Americans \ncould have. Of course, the entire country was able to hear delayed \naudio feeds of the two Supreme Court oral arguments in Bush v. Gore and \nthe arguments on affirmative action. This allowed the public and \nimportant look at the making of decisions that affect them in a \nprofound way. Seeing the arguments live would have been even better. I \ndo not believe that a discreet camera in the courtroom would have \nchanged the character or quality of the arguments one iota.\n  My State of Wisconsin has a long and proud tradition of open \ngovernment, and it has served us well. Coming from that tradition, I \nlook with skepticism on any remnant of secrecy that lingers in our \ngovernmental processes. Trials and court hearings are public \nproceedings, paid for by the taxpayers. Except in the most rare and \nunusual circumstances, the public is entitled to see what happens in \nthose proceedings.\n  The bill that my friends from Iowa and New York have proposed is a \nresponsible and measured bill. It gives discretion to individual \nFederal judges to allow cameras in their courtrooms. At the same time, \nit assures that witnesses will be able to request that their identities \nnot be revealed in televised proceedings. This bill gives deference to \nthe experience and judgment of Federal judges who remain in charge of \ntheir own courtrooms. That is the right approach.\n  Cameras in the courtroom is an idea whose time came some time ago. It \nis high time we brought it to the Federal courts. I am proud to support \nthe Grassley-Schumer bill, and I hope we can enact it this year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/18/senate-section/article/S3813-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3813]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate \ncrimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable \nin our society. Likewise, each day I have come to the floor to \nhighlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  Last March, a Bronx man was assaulted by a group of teenagers because \nof his sexual orientation. The teenage boys allegedly jumped the man \nnear his home on the evening of March 19, 2005. The assailants \nrepeatedly punched and kicked the man while yelling antigay epithets.\n  I believe that the government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/18/senate-section/article/S3813-2", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3813]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          MEDICAL MALPRACTICE\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, one of my constituents, James W. Carney, \nan attorney practicing in Des Moines, IA, recently requested that I \nbring to the attention of my colleagues in the Senate some aspects of \nthe medical malpractice situation in Iowa he believes should be more \nwidely known. I ask unanimous consent that his March 30 letter to me, \nand his e-mail to John Whitaker, a Representative in the Iowa State \nHouse of Representatives, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  Carney, Appleby,\n\n\n                                    Kielsen & Skinner, P.L.C.,\n\n                                   Des Moines, IA, March 30, 2005.\n     Re medical malpractice reform.\n\n     Senator Charles Grassley,\n     Federal Building,\n     Des Moines, IA.\n       Dear Senator Grassley: I was just listening to WHO and \n     heard your comment that if we had medical malpractice reform \n     we wouldn't have to perform all the tests that are unneeded. \n     As a supporter of yours going back to the days when you were \n     in the Iowa Capitol, I cry foul. I am attaching an email \n     which we sent to all members of the Iowa Legislature.\n       I would request that you make known to the US Senate the \n     true facts of what is going out in real Iowa--real America.\n       Malpractice cases are down 29.6% over the last three years. \n     Civil filings are down in the state of Iowa. Civil jury \n     trials are down in the state of Iowa. There were only 22 \n     malpractice cases tried in the entire state of Iowa last \n     year. Verdicts are down.\n       Meahwhile, guess what? Our physicians are having their \n     malpractice premiums increased by 10, 15 and 20%. It is \n     ridiculous to blame lawyers.\n       Doctors perform tests because they believe it is the best \n     patient care and the tests are necessary. I have yet to talk \n     to a doctor who is willing to admit that the only reason they \n     perform a test is because they fear they are going to be sued \n     or it might be malpractice. Doctors perform tests because \n     their patients deserve the best medical care they can give \n     them. I believe they are motivated from an altruistic point \n     of view and they truly care about their patients. I have \n     heard it said many times that it might also be in their best \n     financial interest to order tests, as they obviously get paid \n     for the services. Blaming Iowa lawyers for unnecessary \n     medical tests is like blaming a farmer for drought or floods. \n     I am attaching the civil filing statistics from the Supreme \n     Court of the State of Iowa. I hope these come in handy for \n     your reference the next time you are asked about malpractice. \n     You have always been a very no-nonsense guy and a person \n     driven by the facts. These are the facts. As my mentor, Mr. \n     Jones, used to say ``end of report''.\n       Thank you for your good service in the US Senate, but I \n     sure hope this information may help you on the issue of \n     medical malpractice. In my home town of Centerville, I can \n     assure you the number one issue for doctors is Medicaid-\n     Medicare reimbursement--not malpractice. The second major \n     issue for them is lifestyle and the fact that they have very \n     few nights and/or weekends off. The third issue is culture \n     and/or the lack of such. Way down the list malpractice, \n     because there has never even been a malpractice case filed in \n     approximately half the counties in Iowa.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     James W. Carney.\n                                  ____\n\n       Although you hear all types of stories about lawsuits and \n     anecdotal stories about litigation, you should know what the \n     facts are here in Iowa. It is the farthest thing from the \n     truth to argue that Iowa is a litigious state. Consider the \n     following:\n       Fact 1: Medical malpractice lawsuits are down 29.6% over \n     the last three years.\n       Fact 2: According to the National Association of Insurance \n     Commissioners own reporting, Iowa has one of the lowest loss \n     experiences in the United States. Medical malpractice \n     insurance companies collected over $60 million in premiums \n     from Iowa physicians and paid out $41 million for direct \n     losses, defense and cost containment expenses. The Iowa loss \n     ratio is 67.64%, one of the lowest in the country.\n       Fact 3: Independent rating services substantiate that \n     capping recoveries will not have any effect on insurance \n     premiums or the availability of insurance.\n       Fact 4: Iowa has already adopted significant tort reform \n     measures, and because of this, is rated as having one of the \n     most reasonable and fair litigation systems in the United \n     States by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n       Iowa's civil justice system, conservative jurors and low \n     verdicts are not the cause of high insurance rates for Iowa \n     physicians. Caps on non-economic damages will not do anything \n     to help Iowa physicians obtain lower insurance premiums. Caps \n     will hurt innocent Iowa citizens who, through no fault of \n     their own, have been severely injured. Should not \n     professionals who cause injuries to innocent patients be \n     responsible for their negligent conduct?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/18/senate-section/article/S3813-3", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3813-S3814]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n            HONORING STUDENTS FROM WEST WARWICK HIGH SCHOOL\n\n Mr. CHAFEE.

I \nam sure this valuable experience will encourage these young Rhode \nIslanders to remain engaged with government and public policy issues in \nthe future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/18/senate-section/article/S3814-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3814]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HONORING ANNE L. BLUMENBERG\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to pay special \ntribute to Anne L. Blumenberg, one of Baltimore's most skillful \nattorneys and equally one of its most dedicated and visionary citizens. \nAnne recently retired as executive director of the Community Law \nCenter, which develops innovative legal strategies to assist \nBaltimore's community organizations and neighborhoods.\n  Anne was born and raised in Baltimore's Waverly neighborhood, and she \nreturned to Baltimore after receiving her law degree from Catholic \nUniversity's Columbus School of Law. In 1983, she and a group of like-\nminded lawyers and community activists founded the Community Law \nCenter. In its early days the center focused primarily on public safety \nas the path to neighborhood survival, depending on volunteer lawyers to \ncarry out its work. Under Anne's leadership, the center's attorneys \npioneered the use of nuisance laws as a litigation strategy to address \nquality-of-life issues, including housing conditions and drug activity, \nin Baltimore neighborhoods. The center had such great success with \nthese suits that in 1996, the Maryland General Assembly passed the \ncommunity rights bill--developed in large measure by the center--\ngranting Baltimore City community associations legal standing to seek \ndirect enforcement of housing, building, zoning, and health codes as a \nremedy to a public nuisance.\n  Recognizing that creating healthy neighborhoods begins but does not \nend with public safety, Anne Blumenberg expanded the Community Law \nCenter's programs to include economic development and real estate \nissues. Today the center has successful projects to end predatory \nlending and flipping practices and to end the blight of vacant \nproperties in city neighborhoods. Further, the volunteer spirit that \ngave the center its start lives on in its pro bono project, which \ncurrently has 185 active pro bono attorneys and has opened over 500 \ncases serving hundreds of organizations in the Baltimore area.\n  In addition to the hours she has dedicated to the Community Law \nCenter, Anne Blumenberg has generously donated her time to serve as a \nboard member to numerous other community organizations, including Civil \nJustice, Inc., Empowerment Legal Services, the Coalition to End \nChildhood Lead Poisoning, and the Lawyer's Clearinghouse. And she has \nliterally ``written the book'' on starting a nonprofit organization: \nher manual, ``Starting a Non-Profit Organization: A Practical Guide,'' \nis now in its fourth edition.\n  Anne Blumenberg was truly a visionary. She saw, earlier than most, \nhow legal tools could be used to improve the lives of some of the city \nof Baltimore's poorest and most vulnerable citizens, and she \ntransformed her vision into a creative, vigorous and effective public \nservices law firm. As a result of the programs Anne Blumenberg built at \nthe Community Law Center, Baltimore's neighborhoods have come alive \nagain. Residents now have the tools they need to fight the flipping of \nhomes by unscrupulous lenders; to remove drug dealers from their \ncorners; to acquire vacant houses, renovate them, and put them up for \nsale; and more broadly, to promote citywide policies that will improve \nthe quality of their lives. In short, thanks to Anne Blumenberg's hard \nwork and dedication, Baltimoreans are once again in control of their \nneighborhoods, and the neighborhoods, which do so much to define \nBaltimore's character, are blooming.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/18/senate-section/article/S3814-2", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3814]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             HONORING THE RETIREMENT OF ROBERT H. MCKINNEY\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I inform my colleagues of the \nretirement of a remarkable figure in my home State of Indiana, Robert \nH. McKinney.\n  Bob McKinney has been a friend of mine since my days as Mayor of \nIndianapolis. During that time he was critical to the passage of Uni-\nGov, the massive restructuring of the boundaries and governmental \nstructure of the City of Indianapolis. His bipartisan support of this \nshared vision was instrumental in allowing for the progress and \nprosperity of Indianapolis.\n  Bob's commitment to public service began at an early age. After \ngraduating from the United States Naval Academy Bob, served for 3 years \nin the Pacific Theater. Additionally, he served two more years in the \nPacific during the Korean War. He is a fine product of both the Naval \nJustice School and the Indiana University School of Law. Bob also holds \nHonorary Doctorates of Law from Marian College and Butler University.\n  Supplementing his impressive academic and military careers, Bob \nremains a consistent voice in public service throughout the State of \nIndiana and nationally. From 1989 to 1998 he was a trustee of Indiana \nUniversity, including a term as President of the Board from 1993-1994. \nHe was Chairman of the Board of Advisors of Indiana University-Purdue \nUniversity at Indianapolis and was formerly a director and Chairman of \nthe Board of Trustees of Marian College. Additionally, as a trustee of \nthe Hudson Institute, the U.S. Naval Academy Foundation, the Indiana \nUniversity Foundation, and the Sierra Club Foundation, Bob continues to \nencourage sound public policy.\n  During the administration of President Carter, he served as Chairman \nof the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage \nCorporation, the Federal Savings & Loan Insurance Corporation, and the \nNeighborhood Reinvestment Corporation. Currently, he is a member of the \nPresidential Advisory Board for Cuba.\n  Bob has likewise achieved numerous successes in the private sector. \nAfter cofounding one of the largest law firms in Indianapolis, Bose \nMcKinney & Evans LLP, Bob served as Chairman of The Somerset Group, \nInc., a publicly traded financial services company. In 2000, The \nSomerset Group merged into the First Indiana Corporation, a publicly \ntraded bank holding company that operates First Indiana Bank, the \nlargest bank based in Indianapolis. Now, Bob is preparing to turn those \nduties over to his able daughter, Marni McKinney.\n  I am pleased to have had this opportunity to call to the attention of \nmy colleagues the extraordinary accomplishments of Bob McKinney. I \nadmire his idealism and sustained energy and I join his wife, Arlene, \nhis five children and five grandchildren, in wishing him every \ncontinuing success as he enters this new chapter of his life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/18/senate-section/article/S3814-3", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3814-S3815]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ACCOLADES TO REVEREND T.F.

Mr. President, I congratulate students from Valley \nView High School in Jonesboro, AR for winning their statewide \ncompetition and earning the chance to come to our Nation's capital to \ncompete in the national finals of ``We the People: The Citizen and the \nConstitution''. Led by their teacher Dana Shoemaker, students Jarrett \nClark, Virginia Gray, Tyler Isbell, Zachery Lesley, Ryan McCormack, \nAshley Perryman, Whitney Philamlee, Olga Redko, Elizabeth Renshaw, \nLaura Stahl, and Molly Throgmorton will join more than 1,200 students \nfrom across the country to take part in the weekend-long competition.\n  ``We the People'' is a nationwide program developed specifically to \neducate young people about the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights. \nThe program is funded by the U.S. Department of Education, and it \nprovides a unique and valuable opportunity for high school students to \nlearn about the foundations of the Federal Government while spending \ntime in Washington, D.C., the center of American civic engagement.\n  It is a wonderful thing that these students have taken such an \ninterest in government and the political system. The vibrancy of our \ndemocracy depends on the active participation of its citizens. And with \nevery new generation, we are faced with the challenge of educating our \nfuture leaders in the value of civic engagement. I am happy that the \nparents and teachers of these students from Jonesboro are meeting that \nimportant challenge and that the students are taking an active role in \ntheir own education by participating in such an enriching program.\n  While in Washington, the students will participate in a 3-day \nacademic competition that simulates a congressional hearing, in which \nthey testify before a panel of judges. Students demonstrate their \nknowledge and understanding of constitutional principles and have \nopportunities to evaluate and debate positions on relevant historical \nand contemporary issues. It is important to note that the Educational \nTesting Service--ETS, the world's largest private educational testing \nand research organization, characterizes the ``We the People'' program \nas a ``great instructional success.'' Independent studies by ETS have \nrevealed that ``We the People'' students ``significantly outperformed \ncomparison students on every topic of the tests taken.'' I am delighted \nthat the Valley View Blazers can take advantage of such a great \nopportunity.\n  These 11 students from Jonesboro certainly deserve recognition for \ntheir hard work and talent. Through their knowledge of the U.S. \nConstitution and our political system, they have earned the right to \ncompete at the highest level. I am proud that such fine young ladies \nand gentlemen will be representing my state on the national stage, and \nI am honored to acknowledge their accomplishment.\n  I wish these students the best of luck at the ``We the People'' \nnational finals, and I applaud their outstanding achievement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/18/senate-section/article/S3815-2", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3815]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        WORLD WAR II REMEMBRANCE\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to share with you a \nremarkable story from World War II and the remembrance shown by our \nfriends in Germany.\n  Lindlar, Germany a small town outside of Cologne, is honoring the \nmemory of an American war hero who lost his life during WWII. First \nLieutenant Victor Rutkowski was a 24 year old, B-17 co-pilot assigned \nto the 390th Bombardment Group stationed in England. Lindlar will be \ndedicating a monument to Victor's memory and holding a memorial service \nto honor him this weekend.\n  Doug Johnson was the pilot of the B-17 during Victor's last mission. \nThe following is his account of that final mission.\n  Oct 15, 1944: My 35th and final mission started about like most of \nthe others we had flown during the previous few months. Two of our \nearlier missions had extended all the way from England, over Germany \nlanding in Russia for a short stay. Leaving Russia and bombing in \nPoland and Rumania before proceeding on to Italy for a couple days \nbefore our final leg back into Framlingham, England. But this time we \nwere going on a relatively short mission to Cologne, Germany. We were \nto fly the lead position, high element of ``B'' squadron. Take off went \naccording to schedule and we were airborne at about 0534. Climb out and \nassembly was simply routine. We reached the IP and turned toward the \ntarget area. No enemy fighters were sighted and it looked like the flak \nwas going to be light and inaccurate. Hey, this was going to be a piece \nof cake.\n  Just before bombs away the flak became moderate and their gunners \nwere beginning to home in on us. Suddenly we received a burst right \nunder the right wing. We lost number 4 engine and Victor Rutkowski, my \nco-pilot, feathered it immediately then informed me that number three \nengine was on fire. Now things were beginning to get pretty tense. We \nattempted to extinguish the fire with no success and it's about time \nfor bombs away. We continued and dropped our bombs in the target area. \nWe notified the squadron leader and immediately pulled away from the \nformation. I called out on the intercom that ``we had better get out of \nhere before this plane blows up''. Things looked pretty bad. I called \nback later to the crew but got no answer because all of them except the \nco-pilot, engineer and myself had already bailed out.\n  The fire continued in number 3 engine so the engineer bailed out and \nVictor followed him. I climbed down to bail out but decided to take one \nlast look at number 3. The fire appeared to have gone out. The plane \nwas in a slight dive as I climbed back into the seat. Upon returning \nthe plane to level flight I noticed that the fire re appeared. I then \nput the plane in a fairly steep dive. I remember saying to myself \n``come on baby we've gotten this far, don't blow up on me now''. The \nfire blew out shortly thereafter. My luck was still holding.\n  I was down to about 4000 feet by now and found myself flying through \nsome more flak, and small arms fire. I didn't realize at the time that \nI was flying directly over the ground fighting between our troops and \nthe Germans somewhere north of Aachen. I really did not know who was \nshooting at me then but luckily I was out of it in a minute or so. I \nfinally contacted a P-47 fighter pilot in the area who led me into St. \nTrond, Belgium, Site A92, where the landing was not the best I had ever \nmade. A flat right tire that had been shot out by flak didn't help. \nAfter exiting the plane and walking around to inspect the damage, I \nnoticed that the tail gunner was still at his post. A flak burst had \nkilled him. The plane had about 200 holes in it and the fuel was still \nleaking from the number 3 engine. I still can't figure out why that \nplane didn't blow up.\n  I later learned that my co pilot was killed on the ground by German \ncivilians and that my bombardier had been wounded but evaded and my \nengineer also escaped capture and returned to base. The rest of my crew \nspent the balance of the war as POWs.\n  A truly remarkable story that speaks vividly to the sacrifice \nsoldiers such as Victor made fighting for their countries.\n  I would like to commend the citizens of Lindlar for honoring the \nmemory of Victor Rutkowski and all those who died during in WorId War \nII. I would like to add the thanks of the Rutkowski family and the \nUnited States Senate to Lindlar for this special tribute.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/18/senate-section/article/S3815-3", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3815]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        ENROLLED BILL PRESENTED\n\n  The Secretary of the Senate reported that on Friday, April 15, 2005, \nshe had presented to the President of the United States the following \nenrolled bill:\n\n       S. 256.

A bill to establish the Crossroads of the American Revolution \nNational Heritage Area in the State of New Jersey, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, today, along with Senator Lautenberg, I \nam introducing legislation, the Crossroads of the American Revolution \nNational Heritage Area Act, to establish the Crossroads of the American \nRevolution National Heritage Area in the State of New Jersey. I am \nproud to be joining my New Jersey colleagues, Representatives Rodney \nFrelinghuysen and Rush Holt, who have introduced this legislation in \nthe House of Representatives, with the support of the entire New Jersey \ndelegation.\n  This legislation recognizes the critical role that New Jersey played \nduring the American Revolution. In fact, New Jersey was the site of \nnearly 300 military engagements that helped determine the course of our \nhistory as a Nation. Many of these locations, like the site where \nGeorge Washington made his historic crossing of the Delaware River, are \nwell known and preserved. Others, such as the Monmouth Battlefield \nState Park in Manalapan and Freehold, and New Bridge Landing in River \nEdge, are less well known and are threatened by development or in \ncritical need of funding for rehabilitation.\n  To help preserve New Jersey's Revolutionary War sites, this \nlegislation would establish a Crossroads of the American Revolution \nNational Heritage Area, linking about 250 sites in 15 counties. This \ndesignation would authorize $10 million to assist preservation, \nrecreational and educational efforts by the State, county and local \ngovernments as well as private cultural and tourism groups. The program \nwould be managed by the non-profit Crossroads of the American \nRevolution Association.\n  Simply put, we are the Nation that we are today because of the \ncritical events that occurred in New Jersey during the American \nRevolution and the many who died fighting there. By enacting the \nCrossroads of the American Revolution National Heritage Area Act of \n2005, we will pay tribute to the patriots who fought and died in New \nJersey so that we might become a Nation free from tyranny.\n  In the 107th Congress, I was proud to see the Senate approve this \nlegislation as part of a bipartisan package of heritage area bills. \nUnfortunately, the bill was not approved in the House of \nRepresentatives. I will work even harder in the 109th Congress to see \nthat this important legislation passes both houses and goes to the \nPresident's desk for his signature. I hope my colleagues will support \nthis legislation, and I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S3820]]\n\n                                 S. 825\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Crossroads of the American \n     Revolution National Heritage Area Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the State of New Jersey was critically important during \n     the American Revolution because of the strategic location of \n     the State between the British armies headquartered in New \n     York City, New York, and the Continental Congress in the city \n     of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania;\n       (2) General George Washington spent almost half of the \n     period of the American Revolution personally commanding \n     troops of the Continental Army in the State of New Jersey, \n     including 2 severe winters spent in encampments in the area \n     that is now Morristown National Historical Park, a unit of \n     the National Park System;\n       (3) it was during the 10 crucial days of the American \n     Revolution between December 25, 1776, and January 3, 1777, \n     that General Washington, after retreating across the State of \n     New Jersey from the State of New York to the State of \n     Pennsylvania in the face of total defeat, recrossed the \n     Delaware River on the night of December 25, 1776, and went on \n     to win crucial battles at Trenton and Princeton in the State \n     of New Jersey;\n       (4) Thomas Paine, who accompanied the troops during the \n     retreat, described the events during those days as ``the \n     times that try men's souls'';\n       (5) the sites of 296 military engagements are located in \n     the State of New Jersey, including--\n       (A) several important battles of the American Revolution \n     that were significant to--\n       (i) the outcome of the American Revolution; and\n       (ii) the history of the United States; and\n       (B) several national historic landmarks, including \n     Washington's Crossing, the Old Trenton Barracks, and \n     Princeton, Monmouth, and Red Bank Battlefields;\n       (6) additional national historic landmarks in the State of \n     New Jersey include the homes of--\n       (A) Richard Stockton, Joseph Hewes, John Witherspoon, and \n     Francis Hopkinson, signers of the Declaration of \n     Independence;\n       (B) Elias Boudinout, President of the Continental Congress; \n     and\n       (C) William Livingston, patriot and Governor of the State \n     of New Jersey from 1776 to 1790;\n       (7) portions of the landscapes important to the strategies \n     of the British and Continental armies, including waterways, \n     mountains, farms, wetlands, villages, and roadways--\n       (A) retain the integrity of the period of the American \n     Revolution; and\n       (B) offer outstanding opportunities for conservation, \n     education, and recreation;\n       (8) the National Register of Historic Places lists 251 \n     buildings and sites in the National Park Service study area \n     for the Crossroads of the American Revolution that are \n     associated with the period of the American Revolution;\n       (9) civilian populations residing in the State of New \n     Jersey during the American Revolution suffered extreme \n     hardships because of--\n       (A) the continuous conflict in the State;\n       (B) foraging armies; and\n       (C) marauding contingents of loyalist Tories and rebel \n     sympathizers;\n       (10) because of the important role that the State of New \n     Jersey played in the successful outcome of the American \n     Revolution, there is a Federal interest in developing a \n     regional framework to assist the State of New Jersey, local \n     governments and organizations, and private citizens in--\n       (A) preserving and protecting cultural, historic, and \n     natural resources of the period; and\n       (B) bringing recognition to those resources for the \n     educational and recreational benefit of the present and \n     future generations of citizens of the United States; and\n       (11) the National Park Service has conducted a national \n     heritage area feasibility study in the State of New Jersey \n     that demonstrates that there is a sufficient assemblage of \n     nationally distinctive cultural, historic, and natural \n     resources necessary to establish the Crossroads of the \n     American Revolution National Heritage Area.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to assist communities, organizations, and citizens in \n     the State of New Jersey in preserving--\n       (A) the special historic identity of the State; and\n       (B) the importance of the State to the United States;\n       (2) to foster a close working relationship among all levels \n     of government, the private sector, and local communities in \n     the State;\n       (3) to provide for the management, preservation, \n     protection, and interpretation of the cultural, historic, and \n     natural resources of the State for the educational and \n     inspirational benefit of future generations;\n       (4) to strengthen the value of Morristown National \n     Historical Park as an asset to the State by--\n       (A) establishing a network of related historic resources, \n     protected landscapes, educational opportunities, and events \n     depicting the landscape of the State of New Jersey during the \n     American Revolution; and\n       (B) establishing partnerships between Morristown National \n     Historical Park and other public and privately owned \n     resources in the Heritage Area that represent the strategic \n     fulcrum of the American Revolution; and\n       (5) to authorize Federal financial and technical assistance \n     for the purposes described in paragraphs (1) through (4).\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to provide that the conveyance of the former radar \nbomb scoring site to the city of Conrad, Montana, is not subject to \nreversion; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I take the floor today to ask that we \nfinally help the town of Conrad, MT continue its successful program of \nproviding affordable housing for our seniors. I renew my commitment to \nmaking sure this occurs.\n  In the defense authorization act of 1994, the Air Force conveyed an \nunused 42-acre parcel of land to the city of Conrad, which then built a \nretirement home for Montana seniors. The home has been a great success, \nand the city of Conrad has begun the process of expanding the facility.\n  When the city proposed using the land as collateral for the home, it \nran into a problem. In the quitclaim deed where we conveyed the land to \nthe city, we included a customary reversion clause that would transfer \nthe property back to the Department of Defense in the event that the \nland stopped being used for the purpose of housing or public \nrecreation.\n  While the intent of this clause is and will continue to be met, a \nsmall city like Conrad must use the title to the land to secure \nconstruction loans, rather than issuing a municipal bond or some other \nmeasure to raise funds used by larger cities. The reversion clause \nprevents banks from using the land to secure the loan, as the city does \nnot have clear title to the land.\n  Therefore, I ask the Senate to approve this modification to public \nlaw 103-160, section 2816 regarding the 42 acre site of the Blue Sky \nVilla, which removes the reversion clause for this\n\n[[Page S3822]]\n\nland, giving the city of Conrad clear title. I thank the Senate for \nit's consideration of this important matter for our senior citizens in \nMontana.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself, Mr. Schumer, and Mrs. Clinton):\n  S. 827. A bill to prohibit products that contain dry ultra-filtered \nmilk products, milk protein concentrate, or casein from being labeled \nas domestic natural cheese, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to re-introduce the Quality \nCheese Act of 2005. This legislation will protect the consumer, save \ntaxpayer dollars and provide support to America's dairy farmers, who \nhave taken a beating in the marketplace in recent years.\n  When Wisconsin consumers have the choice, they will choose natural \nWisconsin cheese. But some in the food industry have pushed the Food \nand Drug Administration (FDA) to change current law, which would leave \nconsumers not knowing whether cheese is really all natural or not.\n  If the Federal Government creates a loophole for imitation cheese \ningredients to be used in U.S. cheese vats, some cheese labels saying \n``domestic'' and ``natural'' will no longer be truly accurate.\n  If USDA and FDA allow a change in Federal rules, imitation milk \nproteins known as milk protein concentrate, casein, or dry ultra \nfiltered milk could be used to make cheese in place of the wholesome \nnatural milk produced by cows in Wisconsin or other parts of the U.S.\n  I was deeply concerned by these efforts to change America's natural \ncheese standard. This effort to allow milk protein concentrate and \ncasein into natural cheese products flies in the face of logic and \ncould create a loophole that could allow unlimited amounts of \nsubstandard imported milk proteins to enter U.S. cheese vats.\n  While the industry proposal was withdrawn, my legislation would \npermanently prevent a similar back-door attempt to allow imitation milk \nas a cheese ingredient and ensure that consumers could be confident \nthat they were buying natural cheese when they saw the natural label.\n  Over the past decade, cheese consumption has risen at a strong pace \ndue in part to promotional and marketing efforts and investments by \ndairy farmers across the country. Year after year, per capita cheese \nconsumption has risen at a steady rate.\n  These proposals to change our natural cheese standards, however, \ncould decrease consumption of natural cheese by raising concerns about \nthe origin of casein and milk protein concentrate. Use of such products \ncould significantly tarnish the wholesome reputation of natural cheese \nin the eyes of the consumer and have unknown effects on quality and \nflavor.\n  This change could seriously compromise decades of work by America's \ndairy farmers to build up domestic cheese consumption levels. It is \nsimply not fair to America's farmers or to consumers. After all, \nconsumers have a right to know if the cheese that they buy is \nunnatural. And by allowing milk protein concentrate milk into \nsupposedly natural cheese, we are denying consumers the entire picture.\n  Allowing MPCs or dry ultra-filtered milk into natural cheeses would \nalso harm dairy producers throughout the United States. Some estimate \nthat the annual effect of the change on the dairy farm sector of the \neconomy could be more than $100 million.\n  The proposed change to our natural cheese standard would also harm \nthe American taxpayer. If we allow MPCs to be used in cheese, we will \neffectively permit unrestricted importation of these ingredients into \nthe United States. Because there are no tariffs and quotas on these \ningredients, these heavily subsidized products would quickly displace \nnatural domestic dairy ingredients.\n  These unnatural domestic dairy products would enter our domestic \ncheese market and could depress dairy prices paid to American dairy \nproducers. Low dairy prices, in turn, could result in increased costs \nto the dairy price support program as the federal government is forced \nto buy domestic milk products when they are displaced in the market by \ncheap imports. So, at the same time that U.S. dairy farmers would \nreceive lower prices, the U.S. taxpayer would pay more for the dairy \nprice support program.\n  This change does not benefit the dairy farmer, consumer or taxpayer. \nWho then is it good for?\n  It would benefit only the subsidized foreign MPC producers out to \nmake a fast buck by exploiting a system put in place to support our \ndairy farmers.\n  This legislation addresses the concerns of farmers, consumers and \ntaxpayers by prohibiting dry ultra-filtered milk, casein, and MPCs from \nbeing included in America's natural cheese standard.\n  Congress must shut the door on any backdoor efforts to undermine \nAmerica's dairy farmers. I urge my colleagues to pass my legislation \nand prevent a loophole that would allow changes that hurt the consumer, \ntaxpayer, and dairy farmer.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 827\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Quality Cheese Act of \n     2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. NATURAL CHEESE STANDARD.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1)(A) any change in domestic natural cheese standards to \n     allow dry ultra-filtered milk products, milk protein \n     concentrate, or casein to be labeled as domestic natural \n     cheese would result in increased costs to the dairy price \n     support program; and\n       (B) that change would be unfair to taxpayers, who would be \n     forced to pay more program costs;\n       (2) any change in domestic natural cheese standards to \n     allow dry ultra-filtered milk products, milk protein \n     concentrate, or casein to be labeled as domestic natural \n     cheese would result in lower revenues for dairy farmers;\n       (3) any change in domestic natural cheese standards to \n     allow dry ultra-filtered milk products, milk protein \n     concentrate, or casein to be labeled as domestic natural \n     cheese would cause dairy products containing dry ultra-\n     filtered milk, milk protein concentrate, or casein to become \n     vulnerable to contamination and would compromise the \n     sanitation, hydrosanitary, and phytosanitary standards of the \n     United States dairy industry; and\n       (4) changing the labeling standard for domestic natural \n     cheese would be misleading to the consumer.\n       (b) Prohibition.--Section 401 of the Federal Food, Drug, \n     and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 341) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``Whenever'' and inserting ``(a) \n     Whenever''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(b) The Commissioner may not use any Federal funds to \n     amend section 133.3 of title 21, Code of Federal Regulations \n     (or any corresponding similar regulation or ruling), to \n     include dry ultra-filtered milk, milk protein concentrate, or \n     casein in the definition of the term `milk' or `nonfat milk', \n     as specified in the standards of identity for cheese and \n     cheese products published at part 133 of title 21, Code of \n     Federal Regulations (or any corresponding similar regulation \n     or ruling).''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Leahy, \n        Mr. Craig, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Allen, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Graham, Mr. \n        DeWine, and Mr. Allard):\n  S. 829. A bill to allow media coverage of court proceedings; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Sunshine \nin the Courtroom Act.'' This bill will give Federal judges the \ndiscretion to allow for the photographing, electronic recording, \nbroadcasting and televising of Federal court proceedings. The Sunshine \nin the Courtroom Act will help the public become better informed about \nthe judicial process. Moreover, this bill will help produce a healthier \njudiciary. Increased public scrutiny will bring about greater \naccountability and help judges to do a better job. The sun needs to \nshine in on the Federal courts.\n  Allowing cameras in the Federal courtrooms is consistent with our \nFounding Fathers' intent that trials be held in front of as many people \nas choose to attend. I believe that the First Amendment requires that \ncourt proceedings be open to the public and, by extension, the news \nmedia. The Constitution and Supreme Court have said, ``what transpires \nin the courtroom is public property.'' Clearly, the American values of \nopenness and education\n\n[[Page S3823]]\n\nare served by using electronic media in Federal courtrooms.\n  There are many benefits and no substantial detrimental effects to \nallowing greater public access to the inner workings of our Federal \ncourts. Fifteen States conducted studies aimed specifically at the \neducational benefits derived from camera access courtrooms. They all \ndetermined that camera coverage contributed to greater public \nunderstanding of the judicial system.\n  Moreover, the widespread use in State court proceedings show that \nstill and video cameras can be used without any problems, and that \nprocedural discipline is preserved. According to the National Center \nfor State Courts, all 50 states allow for some modern audio-visual \ncoverage of court proceedings under a variety of rules and conditions. \nMy own State of Iowa has operated successfully in this open manner for \nover 20 years. Further, at the Federal level, the Federal Judicial \nCenter conducted a pilot program in 1994 which studied the effect of \ncameras in a select number of Federal courts. That study found ``small \nor no effects of camera presence on participants in the proceeding, \ncourtroom decorum, or the administration of justice.''\n  I would like to note that even the Supreme Court has recognized that \nthere is a serious public interest in the open airing of important \ncourt cases. At the urging of Senator Schumer and myself, Chief Justice \nRehnquist allowed the delayed audio broadcasting of the oral arguments \nbefore the Supreme Court in the 2000 presidential election dispute. The \nSupreme Court's response to our request was an historic, major step in \nthe right direction. Since then, the Supreme Court has allowed for \naudio broadcasting in other landmark cases. Other courts have followed \nsuit, such as the live audio broadcast of oral arguments before the \nD.C. Circuit in the Microsoft antitrust case and the televising of \nappellate proceedings before the Ninth Circuit in the Napster copyright \ncase. The public wants to see what is happening in these important \njudicial proceedings, and the benefits are significant in terms of \npublic knowledge and discussion.\n  We've introduced the Sunshine in the Courtroom Act with a well-\nfounded confidence based on the experience of the States as well as \nState and Federal studies. However, in order to be certain of the \nsafety and integrity of our judicial system, we have included a 3-year \nsunset provision allowing a reasonable amount of time to determine how \nthe process is working before making the provisions of the bill \npermanent.\n  It is also important to note that the bill simply gives judges the \ndiscretion to use cameras in the courtroom. It does not require judges \nto have cameras in their courtroom if they do not want them. The bill \nalso protects the anonymity of non-party witnesses by giving them the \nright to have their voices and images obscured during testimony.\n  So, the bill does not require cameras, but allows judges to exercise \ntheir discretion to permit camera in appropriate cases. The bill \nprotects witnesses and does not compromise safety. The bill preserves \nthe integrity of the judicial system. The bill is based on the \nexperience of the States and the Federal courts. And the bill's net \nresult will be greater openness and accountability of the nation's \nFederal courts. The best way to maintain confidence in our judicial \nsystem, where the Federal judiciary holds tremendous power, is to let \nthe sun shine in by opening up the Federal courtrooms to public view \nthrough broadcasting. And allowing cameras in the courtroom will bring \nthe judiciary into the 21st century. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting the Sunshine in the Courtroom Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 829\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for the establishment of a Health Workforce \nAdvisory Commission to review Federal health workforce policies and \nmake recommendations on improving those policies; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat will help address the devastating health workforce shortages we \nwill be facing in this country. Health care expenditures represent 15.3 \npercent of U.S. gross domestic product. These expenditures are expected \nto rise to l8.7 percent by 2014. As health care needs grow, society \nfaces increasing challenges related to the health care workforce. By \n2020, 29 percent nursing positions are projected to be vacant. From \n2000-2010, an additional 1.2 million aides will be needed to cover \nprojected growth in long-term care positions and replacement of \ndeparting workers. An aging health care workforce means that by 2008, \nalmost half of the workforce will be 45 years of age and older. \nCurrently, U.S. providers rely on international medical graduate and \nforeign trained nurses to fill some critical roles, while continuing to \nface a shortage of providers in health professional shortage areas. \nHealth workforce challenges need to analyzed, understood, and \nalleviated, to ensure better access and better quality of care.\n  The Health Workforce Advisory Commission Act of 2005 will help to \ncreate a national vision to serve as a roadmap for investing in the \nhealth workforce. Through analysis and recommendation, an 18 member \ncommission of national workforce and health experts will provide \ninsight regarding the solutions necessary to enhance our health \nworkforce. Key areas for commission focus will include forecasting of \nsupply and distribution of physicians, nurses and other health \nprofessionals, studying the national and global impact of workforce \npolicies related to the utilization of internationally trained \npractitioners, and developing appropriate measures to ensure diversity \nof the U.S. health workforce. The commission will make recommendations \nto Congress on health workforce policy.\n\n[[Page S3824]]\n\n  It is vital that the U.S. take new measures to ensure that workforce \nchallenges are met and overcome for current and future generations. By \nundertaking and overcoming the challenges before us, we will enhance \nboth the quality of healthcare and the quality of life, provide access \nnationwide, and build a health care system that is consistent with our \ncurrent and future health and economic needs.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \ntaxpayer protection and assistance, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  MR. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Taxpayer \nProtection and Assistance Act of 2005'' with Senators Smith, Baucus, \nGrassley, Akaka, Schumer and Pryor. This legislation combines various \nprovisions intended to ensure that our nation's taxpayers are better \nable to prepare and file their tax returns each year in a fashion that \nis fair, reasonable and affordable. As long as we continue to require \ntaxpayers to determine their own tax liability each year, we have a \nresponsibility to ensure that we do not leave taxpayers vulnerable to \nabuses from those masquerading as tax professionals. This is bad for \neveryone including the majority of tax return preparers who provide \nprofessional and much needed services to taxpayers in their \ncommunities. I encourage my colleagues to work with us to ensure that \nthe improvements that would be brought about by this bill are in place \nbefore the next filing season begins.\n  As I previously stated, this legislation is composed of several \nprovisions. The first section would create a $10 million matching grant \nprogram for lower income tax preparation clinics much like the program \nwe have currently have in place for tax controversies. I have seen \nfirst hand the impact free tax preparation clinics can have on \ntaxpayers and their communities, as we are fortunate to have one of the \nbest state-wide programs in the nation in New Mexico. TaxHelp New \nMexico, which was started only a couple of years ago, helped 17,000 New \nMexicans prepare and file their returns last year, resulting in over \n$14 million in refunds--all without refund anticipation loans. This \nyear they are on pace to pass their goal of helping 25,000 elderly and \neconomically disadvantaged taxpayers with free tax preparation and \nelectronic filing of their returns. This program, started by Fred \nGordon and Robin Brule from TVI and Carol Radosevich and Jeff Sterba \nfrom PNM, has turned into one of the best delivery mechanisms for \npublic assistance I have seen in the state. This program has been \nfortunate to receive additional funding from the Annie E. Casey \nFoundation and the McCune Foundation. In order to continue to grow, \nthough, we need to do our part in Congress and give them matching \nfunding so they can continue their outreach into new communities in \nneed of assistance.\n  The second set of provisions contained in this legislation would \nensure that when taxpayers hire someone to help them with their tax \nreturns they can be sure that the person is competent and professional. \nThe first part of the bill makes sure that an enrolled agent, a tax \nprofessional licensed to practice before the IRS, shall have the \nexclusive right to describe him or herself as an ``enrolled agent,'' \n``EA,'' or ``E.A.'' In New Mexico, enrolled agents play an important \nrole in helping taxpayers with problems with the IRS and with preparing \ntheir returns. They have earned the right to use their credentials, and \nwe should prohibit those who have not taken the rigorous exams and do \nnot have their experience to confuse the public into thinking they too \nhave the same credentials. The second part of the bill requires the \nTreasury to determine what standards need to be met in order for a \nperson to prepare tax returns commercially. Like all other tax \nprofessionals, this will require people who make a living preparing tax \nreturns to pass a minimum competency exam and take brush up courses \neach year to keep abreast of tax law changes. The majority of tax \nreturn preparers already meet these standards, and it is clear that \nthose who do not need to in order to prepare returns for a fee. The \nTreasury Department will also be required to operate a public awareness \ncampaign so that taxpayers will know that they need to check to be sure \nthat someone preparing their tax returns for a fee is qualified.\n  The third set of provisions would directly address the problems with \nrefund anticipation loans (RALs), which is a problem throughout the \ncountry, but is particularly bad in New Mexico. First, this bill \nrequires refund loan facilitators to register with the Treasury \nDepartment. Refund loan facilitators are those people who solicit, \nprocess, or otherwise facilitate the making of a refund anticipation \nloan in relation to a tax return being electronically filed. The \nlegislation also requires these refund loan facilitators to properly \ndisclose to taxpayers that they do not have to get a RAL in order to \nfile their return electronically, as well as clearly disclose what all \nthe costs involved with the loan. Finally, the refund loan facilitators \nmust disclose to taxpayers when the loans would allow their refunds to \nbe offset by the amount of the loan. Failure to follow these new rules \nwill empower Treasury to impose penalties as appropriate. Like the \ncredentials required for preparing returns, the Treasury Department \nwould need to operate a public awareness campaign to educate the public \non the real costs of RALs as compared to other forms of credit. This \nprogram will be funded, at least in part, by amounts collected from \npenalties imposed on refund loan facilitators.\n  The last section of the bill is an issue that my colleague from \nHawaii, Senator Akaka, has been actively working on for the last \nseveral years. This provision would authorize the Treasury Department \nto award grants to financial institutions or charitable groups that \nhelp low income taxpayers set up accounts at bank or credit union. \nBecause many taxpayers do not have checking or savings accounts, their \nrefund from IRS cannot be electronically wired to them. The alternative \nis to have the check mailed to the taxpayer or to have the refund \nimmediately loaned to the taxpayer in the form of a RAL. Of course, \ngetting people to set up a checking or savings account for purposes of \nreceiving their tax refund will also have the benefit of getting many \nof these people to start saving for the first time.\n  Before I conclude, I would specifically like to thank Anita Horn \nRizek from the Finance Committee for her tireless dedication to \nimproving our nation's tax system and ensuring that all taxpayers are \ntreated fairly regardless of their income class. Without her efforts \nthis legislation would not have been possible.\n  I hope my colleagues will join with us to ensure that another tax \nyear does\n\n[[Page S3826]]\n\nnot go by without making these modest changes. In order for our \nvoluntary tax system to continue to function, taxpayers must have \naccess to tax professionals with the highest ethical standards and \ngreatest substantive knowledge possible. This bill will go a long way \ntoward maintaining the integrity of the tax administration system.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and an analysis of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 832\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

EXPANDED USE OF TAX COURT PRACTICE FEES FOR PRO SE \n                   TAXPAYERS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 7475(b) (relating to use of fees) \n     is amended by inserting before the period at the end ``and to \n     provide services to pro se taxpayers''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section \n     shall take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act.\n                                  ____\n\n\n           Analysis of Taxpayer Protection and Assistance Act\n\n       OPR discipline is imposed after a hearing before an \n     administrative law judge or as a result of an agreement \n     between the OPR and the representative. Little is known about \n     the basis for these actions, because the current practice is \n     to publish only the identity of the representative, the \n     disciplinary action taken; and the effective date. The bill \n     would open the process to the public, providing greater \n     transparency and accountability for both the representatives \n     and the OPR.\n       Following the practice of many State attorney discipline \n     processes, the bill provides that proceedings before an \n     administrative law judge are open to the public. These \n     proceedings are initiated by the Director of the Office of \n     Professional Responsibility after the representative has been \n     notified of the proposed charges, and has had an opportunity \n     to respond to the Director. In many cases, the representative \n     agrees with the Director that a violation of the rules of \n     conduct has occurred, and agrees to accept a disciplinary \n     action without a hearing before an administrative Judge. When \n     discipline is imposed based on such an agreement, the bill \n     provides that the Director will provide summary information \n     about the conduct which gave rise to the sanction.\n       There is a longstanding provision of 26 USC 6103, \n     permitting taxpayer information to be disclosed in \n     proceedings brought to impose discipline under 31 USC 330. \n     The bill provides a limitation on the disclosure of \n     information about the client, allowing the administrative law \n     judge to decide whether the client information is necessary \n     to understand the nature, scope or impact of the misconduct. \n     In cases where discipline is imposed without bringing the \n     matter before an administrative law judge, the Director makes \n     this determination. The bill also provides a general \n     protection for medical information, the release of which \n     would be an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. For \n     example, when a practitioner offers evidence of physical or \n     mental health problems to explain his or her conduct, the \n     release of that medical information in a proceeding may be \n     inappropriate.\n\n  Mr. AKAKA Mr. President, I am proud to cosponsor the Taxpayer \nProtection and Assistance Act of 2005. I thank Senator Bingaman for \nintroducing this bill and working closely with me over the years to \nprotect taxpayers and expand access to financial services. I also \nappreciate all of the efforts of Senators Baucus, Smith, Grassley, and \nPryor on this important piece of consumer protection legislation.\n  The earned income tax credit (EITC) helps working families meet their \nfood, clothing, housing, transportation, and education needs. \nUnfortunately, EITC refunds intended for working families are \nunnecessarily diminished by excessive tax preparation fees and the use \nof refund anticipation loans (RALs). According to the Brookings \nInstitution, an estimated $1.9 billion intended to assist low-income \nfamilies via the EITC was received by commercial tax preparers and \naffiliated national banks to pay for tax assistance, electronic filing \nof returns, and high-cost refund anticipation loans in 2002. Interest \nrates on RALs can range from 97 percent to more than 2,000 percent. The \ninterest rates and fees charged on this type of product are not \njustified given the short duration and low repayment risk of this type \nof loan.\n  This legislation is a good start towards improving the quality of tax \npreparation services, providing relevant and useful disclosures about \nthe use of RALs, and expanding access to low- and moderate-income \nfamilies to mainstream financial services. The Act will provide the \nDepartment of the Treasury with the authority to regulate individuals \npreparing federal income tax returns and other documents for submission \nto the Internal Revenue Service. Fifty-seven percent of EITC overclaims \nwere made on returns put together by paid preparers. This Act requires \nexaminations, education, and oversight of paid preparers and urges \ncitizens to utilize the services of an accredited or licensed tax \npreparer. This should improve the quality of tax preparation services \navailable to our citizens.\n\n[[Page S3829]]\n\n  In addition, the Act will require RAL facilitators to register with \nthe Department of the Treasury, and comply with minimum disclosure \nrequirements intended to improve the understanding of consumers about \nthe costs associated with RALs. The Act also requires that the \nDepartment of the Treasury conduct a public awareness campaign intended \nto improve the knowledge of consumers about the costs associated with \nRALs. We need consumers to know more about the high fees associated \nwith RALs and what alternatives are available, such as opening a bank \nor credit union account and having their refund directly deposited into \nit.\n  I am pleased that authorization language for a grant program to link \ntax preparation services with the opening of a bank or credit union \naccount is included in this legislation. It is estimated that four \nmillion EITC recipients are classified as unbanked, and lack a formal \nrelationship with a financial institution. Approximately 45 percent of \nEITC recipients pay for check cashing services. Check cashing services \nreduce EITC benefits by $130 million. Having a bank account allows \nindividuals to take advantage of electronic filing, thus eliminating \nthe excessive fees that check cashing services and refund anticipation \nloan providers assess. An account at a bank or credit union provides \nconsumers alternatives to rapid refund loans, check cashing services, \nand lower cost remittances. In addition, bank and credit union accounts \nprovide access to products and services found at mainstream financial \ninstitutions, such as savings accounts and reasonably priced loans.\n  This grant program builds upon the First Accounts initiative which \nhas funded pilot projects that have coupled tax preparation services \nwith the establishment of bank accounts. An example of such a project \nis the partnership that has been established by The Center for Economic \nProgress in Chicago. We need more of these types of programs intended \nto provide much needed tax preparation assistance, and encourage the \nuse of mainstream financial services.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation. This is an \nimportant first step towards improving the quality of tax preparation \nservices. I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues on \nadditional consumer protections and initiatives to bring more people \ninto mainstream financial services, such as what I included in S. 324, \nthe Taxpayer Abuse Prevention Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN:\n  S. 833.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Workforce Investment for \n     Next-Generation Technologies Act'' or the ``WING Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Science- and technology-based industries have been and \n     will continue to be engines of United States economic growth \n     and national security.\n       (2) The United States faces great challenges in the global \n     economy from nations with highly trained technical \n     workforces.\n       (3) Occupations requiring technical and scientific training \n     are projected to grow rapidly over the next decade, at 3 \n     times the rate of all occupations (according to Science & \n     Engineering Indicators, 2002).\n       (4) The need for trained technology workers in national \n     security fields has increased as a result of the events of \n     September 11, 2001.\n       (5) National certification systems are well established and \n     accepted in fields such as health and information technology \n     and have succeeded in attracting more workers into those \n     fields.\n       (6) Business and workers could both be well served by \n     expanding the certification concept to other high technology \n     industries.\n       (7) National certification systems allow workers to develop \n     skills transportable to other States in response to layoffs \n     and other economic changes.\n       (8) National certification systems facilitate interstate \n     comparisons of education and training programs and help \n     identify best practices and reduce cost and development \n     redundancies.\n       (9) National certification systems promote quality and \n     encourage educational institutions to modernize programs to \n     ensure graduates pass industry-required exams.\n       (10) National certification based on industry-validated \n     skill standards introduces stricter accountability for \n     technical and vocational education programs.\n       (11) Certification signals value to employers and increases \n     applicants' employability.\n       (12) Certification offers a planned skill development route \n     into employment or professional advancement for working \n     adults and displaced workers.\n       (13) The National Science Foundation's Advanced \n     Technological Education Program, authorized by Congress in \n     1992, has created national centers of excellence at community \n     colleges that have established unique linkages with industry \n     to prepare individuals for the technical workforce under the \n     program.\n       (14) The Advanced Technological Education Program should be \n     expanded to all institutions of higher education, as the \n     Nation should invest more resources in training and education \n     programs that are responsive to marketplace needs.\n       (15) The one-stop delivery systems authorized under the \n     Workforce Investment Act of 1998 have proved to be effective \n     providers of information and resources for job seekers.\n       (16) The one-stop delivery systems offer special \n     opportunities for directing displaced workers to \n     certification programs that build skills for technical fields \n     where rewarding jobs are plentiful.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n       (1) To increase the numbers of workers educated for \n     employment in high technology industries.\n       (2) To align the technical and vocational programs of \n     educational institutions with the workforce needs of high-\n     growth, next generation industries.\n       (3) To offer individuals expanded opportunities for rapid \n     training and retraining in portable skills needed to keep and \n     change jobs in a volatile economy.\n       (4) To provide United States businesses with adequate \n     numbers of skilled technical workers.\n       (5) To encourage a student's or worker's progress toward an \n     advanced degree while providing training, education, and \n     useful credentials for workforce entry or reentry.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Mr. President, today I am introducing the Senior Elder \nCare Relief and Empowerment Act--the SECURE Act.\n  The SECURE Act would provide eligible taxpayers with a nonrefundable \ntax credit equal to 50 percent of qualified expenses incurred on behalf \nof senior citizens above a $1,000 spending floor.\n  The Senate Special Committee on Aging, which I chaired in the 108th \nCongress and of which I remain a member, held several hearings over the \nlast couple years on different facets of the growing long-term care \ncrisis in this country. A major concern of mine is that the Federal \nlong-term care policy mix may not have the right incentives--especially \nwhen it comes to the tough choices faced by families who want to care \nfor their frail and aging relatives.\n  More and more families are facing the stress and financial \ndifficulties that come with caring for their aging parents.\n  It is critical to note that families, not government, provide 80 \npercent of long-term care for older persons in the United States. This \nis an enormous strength of our long-term care system. The U.S. \nAdministration on Aging reports that about 22 million people serve as \ninformal caregivers for seniors with at least one limitation on their \nactivities of daily living.\n  These caregivers often face extreme stress and financial burden--\nespecially those we call the sandwich generation. The sandwich \ngeneration refers to those sandwiched between caring for their aging \nparents and caring for their own children.\n  It is difficult for families to balance caring for children and \nsaving or paying for college, while at the same time struggling with \nfinancing care for frail and aging parents.\n  Many caregivers forgo job promotions, reduce their hours on the job, \ncut back to part-time, or take extended leaves of absence to stay at \nhome and care for their aging family members. Direct expenses include \nthe cost of prescription drugs, durable medical equipment, home \nmodifications, and physical therapy.\n  Caregivers also endure emotional and personal health strains.\n  The average age of a caregiver is 57, with one-third over age 65 \nthemselves. Caregivers suffer from higher rates of depression or \nanxiety. These conditions often lead to higher risk of heart disease, \ncancer, diabetes, or other chronic conditions.\n  For many families, the nursing home is the only solution for \nproviding long-term care, and that can be a good choice. For other \nfamilies, keeping aging and vulnerable relatives in their own home or \nin the caregiver's home makes sense.\n  Family caregiving for aging and vulnerable relatives requires a \nflexible national response to ensure seniors and their families have \nthe most appropriate high quality choices.\n  That is why I am introducing the SECURE Act. This legislation would \nhelp reduce the financial strain and related emotional and medical \nstress faced by family caregivers, as they care for their frail and \naging parents, by providing much-needed tax relief for qualified \nexpenses.\n  The SECURE Act would increase the eldercare choices available to \nfamilies and has the potential to reduce the number of seniors forced \nto spend down their nest-egg in order to qualify for Medicaid services.\n  Qualified expenses include costs that are not reimbursable--those not \ncovered by Medicare or other insurance--for physical assistance with \nessential daily activities to prevent injury; long-term care expenses, \nincluding normal household services; architectural expenses necessary \nto modify the senior's residence; respite care; adult daycare; assisted \nliving services that are non-housing related expenses; independent \nliving; home care; and home health care.\n  Seniors with long-term care needs also would be able to use the tax \ncredit on their own behalf.\n\n[[Page S3832]]\n\n  The SECURE Act should not preclude seniors or those near retirement \nfrom purchasing long-term care insurance. The Act would provide tax \nrelief for high-risk seniors who cannot qualify for long-term care \ninsurance policies.\n  I invite my colleagues to cosponsor this compassionate legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a brief \ndescription be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 835\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Judiciary \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration of S. 289 and the \nSenate proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 289) to authorize an annual appropriation of \n     $10,000,000 for mental health courts through fiscal year \n     2011.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is going to \npass S. 289, a bill to reauthorize the Mental Health Court Program and \nprovide $10 million in grant funding annually for mental health courts \nthrough fiscal year 2011. I am the lead Democratic sponsor of this \nbill, and cosponsored similar legislation in the last Congress.\n  Senator DeWine and I have worked together on a number of mental \nhealth issues. Last year, we worked together to enact the Mentally Ill \nOffender Treatment and Crime Reduction Act, which authorizes $50 \nmillion annually for a range of State and local projects designed to \nreduce the number of crimes committed by mentally ill individuals. We \nare now working together to obtain appropriations to fund the new law.\n  As former prosecutors, Senator DeWine and I both realize the \ntremendous impact of mental illness on our criminal justice system. We \nneed to stop the ``revolving door'' whereby mentally ill offenders \ncycle in and out of the criminal justice system for relatively minor \noffenses, taking up the time and resources of law enforcement officers, \njudges, and the community as a whole. My State of Vermont has benefited \nfrom funding under the Mental Health Court Program, and I know \nfirsthand the good that mental health courts can do.\n  I hope the House will take up this bipartisan and uncontroversial \nlegislation promptly and ensure that Federal support for mental health \ncourts will continue.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and that any statements relating to the measure be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 289) was read the third time and passed, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 289\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled.\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, tomorrow, the Senate will resume \nconsideration of the Iraq-Afghanistan supplemental appropriations bill. \nAt 11:45 a.m., the Senate will proceed to the cloture vote on the \nChambliss immigration amendment, to be followed by a vote on invoking \ncloture on the Craig AgJOBS amendment. Therefore, Senators should \nexpect two cloture votes beginning at 11:45 tomorrow morning.\n  If cloture is not invoked on either of those amendments, the \nChambliss amendment or the Craig amendment, the Senate will continue \nworking through additional amendments to the bill. Under a previous \norder, if the Senate is not in a postcloture period, we will proceed to \nthe cloture vote on the Mikulski language, and that is the Mikulski \nimmigration amendment, at 4:30 tomorrow afternoon. After we dispose of \nthe Mikulski amendment, the Senate will proceed to the cloture vote on \nthe overall bill, the underlying bill.\n  I also announce to my colleagues that, as they can see, we will have \na very busy day over the course of tomorrow. Rollcall votes are likely \nto occur throughout the day, beginning at 11:45 a.m. As a reminder, \nthere is an 11 a.m. filing deadline for second-degree amendments to the \nChambliss and Craig amendments. The filing deadline for second-degree \namendments to the Mikulski amendment and the bill itself will be \ndetermined by the outcome of those two earlier cloture votes tomorrow \nmorning, and Senators will be notified once those deadlines can be \nestablished.\n  Once again, I hope the Senate will invoke cloture on the bill so that \nthe Senate can complete this underlying, important, critical emergency \nfunding bill, an emergency funding bill for our troops in Afghanistan, \nin Iraq, as well as tsunami relief.\n  Over the last week, week and a half, I have encouraged and will \ncontinue to encourage my colleagues not to offer extraneous amendments. \nI know people see this as a bill that is going to ultimately pass this \nfloor, and it is very tempting to throw your outbox on this bill.\n  To be honest, I have been disappointed in the number of extraneous, \nunrelated amendments that have been brought forward. We have 20 pending \namendments to the supplemental appropriations bill. In addition to \nthat, I have on each of these pages about 30 amendments, 4 pages of \namendments Senators have brought forward.\n  I appeal to my colleagues: Let us stay on this bill, the supplemental \nemergency spending bill. We are at war. We have troops who need this \nmoney now. All I can do is continue to appeal. We will have these \nimmigration amendments tomorrow. We will have the opportunity to vote \non these three amendments. That process will begin with the cloture \nvotes at 11:45 in the morning.\n  Once again, use restraint in bringing amendments forward, unless they \nare directed at supplemental emergency spending for our troops overseas \nor tsunami relief.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/18/senate-section/article/S3863-2", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3863]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:45 A.M.
