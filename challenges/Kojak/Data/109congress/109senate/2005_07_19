Mr. President, today, we will begin consideration of H.J. \nRes. 52, which approves the renewal of import restrictions contained in \nthe Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003. We have shortened the \nstatutory time limit. There will now be a 1-hour-20-minute period of \ndebate on the resolution. Thus, Senators can expect a vote on the Burma \nresolution sometime between 12 and 12:30 today, probably closer to \n12:30.\n  Following that vote, we will recess until 2:15 for the weekly policy \nluncheons. Following the recess, we will resume consideration of the \nForeign Operations appropriations bill. Our intentions are to finish \nthat bill, the Foreign Operations appropriations bill, tonight. We have \nbeen on the bill Friday and Monday, and will be now today, with plenty \nof opportunity for our colleagues to come forward, offer their \namendments, and debate their amendments. So our plans are to stay today \nto finish the Foreign Operations bill. I do want to encourage Senators \nto contact the cloakrooms right now, early this morning, if there are \nother amendments to be considered. The two managers will be here to \nconsider those amendments. Again, our intentions are to finish that \nappropriations bill.\n  Over the course of the week, and into next week, before our recess, \nbut most immediately this week, we have a highway extension that will \nhave to be done later today. We have an issue concerning native \nHawaiians that we are working very aggressively on in order to bring it \nto the floor. We will continue to work over the course of the next \nseveral hours to determine how best that can be brought to the floor \nand debated. We have the Department of Defense authorization, an \nimportant bill that we will be addressing before the recess. All of \nthis is dependent on us first completing the Foreign Operations \nappropriations bill. So there is much work to do. We will keep our \ncolleagues informed as to what the specific plans are, but we have a \nlot of business before we depart for the recess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/19/senate-section/article/S8439-7", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8439]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, the only two amendments I am aware of--there \ncould be others; that is why I think it is good we make a call for \nother amendments--is one Senator Dorgan has indicated he may offer \ndealing with the Unocal sale and the amendment being contemplated by \nthe Senator from California, Mrs. Boxer. And we have a pending \namendment that I understand can be worked out. That is Senator \nLandrieu's amendment on adoptions.\n  So it appears we should be able to finish this bill today. I see no \nreason we should not be able to. We will wait until we hear from \nSenator Dorgan and Senator Boxer. I say to them, through their staffs \nwho are watching, they should come forward and offer their amendments \nif they are going to offer them.\n\n[[Page S8440]]\n\n  I have a very short statement I would like to make.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I am pleased the Indian Prime Minister spoke \ntoday before a joint session. His remarks were thoughtful. He spoke of \nthe great promise and values our two nations share--first of all, \ndemocracy.\n  I also welcome to the Senate today several Indian Americans from \nNevada, including my friend, Dr. Chanderaj, and several of my friends \nfrom the Sikh community in northern Nevada. I have gotten to know them. \nThey did a number of events for me this past year. They are very \ninterested in government. I am so impressed with them and their \ncommunity, located mainly in Carson City, NV. They traveled throughout \nthe night so they could be here today for this historic event.\n  The contributions of the Indian American community to Nevada and to \nthis country are significant. They have made such a positive impact in \ncommunities across the Nation.\n  What we have going on in southern Nevada is exemplary. We have an \nAsian-American community there. There is no distinction between \nPakistanis and Indians. They meet together; they join together. Unless \nyou are familiar with the two communities, you could not tell them \napart. They work together. Our largest and most famous Indian \nrestaurant in Las Vegas is run by a Pakistani.\n  So, Mr. President, I am very happy they have made such a positive \nimpact in Nevada and communities all across this great Nation. That is \nwhy I am so pleased the Prime Minister could be here today: to join our \ntwo great democracies, to recognize the common bonds between us, and to \ncelebrate the promising future that lies before us.\n  I would be remiss if I did not recognize one of the leaders of the \nIndian community, someone who has been involved in government and \npolitics. He helps Republicans; he helps Democrats. He is very \ninterested in government. He is a physician by the name of Prabhu, who \nis a friend to so many of us. I acknowledge him today as being someone \nwho has done so much to bring the communities together.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/19/senate-section/article/S8440-2", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8440]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and ask \nunanimous consent that the time run equally against all participants.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, a little more than 2 years ago, thugs \nworking for the military strongmen of Burma attacked Aung San Suu Kyi \nand members of the opposition party that she leads, the National League \nfor Democracy. The Government put Suu Kyi into what they call \n``protective custody.'' She remains under house arrest to this day.\n  In response to this heinous attack, America banned imports from \nBurma. We in Congress believed something had to be done. In 2002, those \nimports were valued at $350 million, mostly in garments.\n  In the autumn of 2003, Burmese Prime Minister Nyunt, who had opposed \nthe attack on the opposition party, called for a seven-point road map \nto Democracy.\n  But the road map led to nowhere. And a rigged national convention \nbroke down when opposition representatives rightly decided to boycott \nit.\n  The strongmen of Burma then removed Prime Minister Nyunt from his \npost. They placed him under house arrest, for supposed corruption. And \nthey replaced him with a hard-line general, whom many believe to have \nplanned the attack.\n  Where does this leave Burma? In short, the ruling generals have \nconsolidated their grip on power. And government security forces \ncontinue to inflict innumerable human rights violations on the Burmese \npeople.\n  This is a tragic situation. The long-suffering people of Burma \ndeserve to be rid of the criminals who purport to represent them.\n  But what is the best way to do that?\n  When the Senate first considered banning Burmese imports, Senator \nGrassley and I worked hard to ensure two key conditions.\n  First, we made sure that Congress would retain its constitutionally \nvested power to impose and evaluate trade sanctions. We should never \nwrite the President a blank check.\n  Second, we made sure that the law would direct the administration to \nwork with other nations, to make these sanctions work. Unilateral \nsanctions seldom work. Unilateral sanctions typically harm innocent \ncitizens far more than the odious rulers against whom they are aimed.\n  Sadly, events on the ground in Burma suggest that these unilateral \nsanctions have proved no exception to the rule. The sanctions have \nharmed innocent citizens. And the odious rulers remain in place.\n  The U.S. ban on Burmese imports caused a number of Burmese garment \nfactories to close. Tens of thousands of garment workers, \noverwhelmingly women, lost their jobs. And more Burmese women, with \nnowhere else to go, turned to prostitution.\n  Today, the Burmese garment industry has to some extent rebounded, \nsustained by new orders from Canada, Europe and Latin America.\n  U.S. sanctions against Burma might have been more effective if other \ncountries would join us in isolating the Burmese regime. But that has \nnot happened.\n  To the contrary, China has embraced the Burmese government. China has \ninvested in Burma's energy sector. And China has extended generous aid \npackages to Burma, including a $356 million aid package that more than \nmakes up for Burma's loss of America's import market.\n  Thailand and India share a long border with Burma. But Thailand and \nIndia have their own ideas about how to deal with Burma's military \nrulers. And those ideas do not include joining U.S. sanctions.\n  And ASEAN member countries continue to welcome Burma to their \neconomic summits.\n  This is not a record of success.\n  Nevertheless, I will vote to renew the sanctions on Burma for another \nyear. But I do so with an eye toward next year, when the sanctions \nautomatically expire.\n  I know that most of my colleagues will vote reflexively to renew \nthese import sanctions. Boycotting Burmese imports allows us to express \nour collective disapproval of the awful regime running Burma. But I \nhope that my colleagues will take a moment to consider whether a \nboycott is the best thing for the Burmese people.\n\n[[Page S8441]]\n\n  Next year, if my colleagues seek to extend the Burmese import \nsanctions, Congress will have to enact new legislation to do so. At \nthat time, I hope that we can have a more extensive debate on how best \nwe can help the cause of freedom, and how best we can help the Burmese \npeople.\n  Mr. President, I note the presence of the Senator from California on \nthe floor, a leader on this issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and the \ndistinguished ranking member of the Finance Committee. I caught the \ntail end of his remarks, and what I heard I agree with.\n  I rise today with my colleague from Kentucky, Senator McConnell, in \nsupport of the resolution renewing import sanctions against Burma. The \nHouse overwhelmingly passed this resolution in a 423-to-2 vote. I \nbelieve it is time for the Senate to follow suit.\n  Almost a month ago, Nobel Peace Prize winner and leader of Burma's \ndemocracy movement Aung San Suu Kyi celebrated her 60th birthday under \nhouse arrest. She has spent the better part of the past 15 years \nimprisoned under house arrest.\n  The brutal military regime, the State Peace and Development Council, \nhas gone to extraordinary lengths to prevent Suu Kyi and her National \nLeague for Democracy from assuming their rightful place as leaders of \nthe Burmese state.\n  It is worth repeating that the NLD decisively won their parliamentary \nelections in 1990, results that were soon nullified by the military \njunta.\n  Two years ago, Congress passed the original sanctions legislation, \nthe Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act, following a brutal attack by \nprogovernment thugs on a motorcade carrying Suu Kyi and several of her \nNLD colleagues. That bill imposed a complete ban on all imports from \nBurma for 1 year and allowed those sanctions to be renewed 1 year at a \ntime for up to 3 years.\n  Last year, in response to the failure of the SPDC to make \n``substantial and measurable progress'' toward a true national dialog \non national reconciliation and recognition of the results of the 1990 \nelections, Congress passed and President Bush signed into law a renewal \nof the import sanctions for another year.\n  One year later, it is clear the military junta has taken no steps \ntoward restoring democracy, releasing Suu Kyi and all political \nprisoners, and respecting human rights and the rule of law and, \ntherefore, we believe we have no choice but to renew the sanctions \nagain for another year.\n  Some may argue that since we are no closer to a free and democratic \nBurma since Congress passed the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act 2 \nyears ago, we should let the import ban expire and attempt to \n``engage'' Rangoon.\n  I disagree. I urge my colleagues to stay the course for this \nadditional year. I ask them to remember that the Burmese Freedom and \nDemocracy Act of 2003--a 1-year ban on Burmese imports--allowed those \nsanctions to be renewed twice for 1 year at a time if Burma failed to \nmake ``substantial and measurable'' progress toward restoring \ndemocracy.\n  We have almost completed 2 years of the import ban and, if we pass \nthis joint resolution, we will renew the sanctions for a third year.\n  If Congress does not renew the import ban when the military junta has \nso clearly failed to meet the conditions set out in the original \nlegislation for having the sanctions lifted, we will reward the SPDC \nfor its inaction and for their continued suppression of the entire \nBurmese people and we will send a clear message to Aung San Suu Kyi and \nthe National League for Democracy that the United States does not stand \nwith them.\n  Brutal regimes around the world would know that if you simply wait \nfor the United States to give in, they will do so. The damage to our \nreputation as leader for freedom and human rights will be devastated \nand will take years to repair. We simply cannot afford to make that \nmistake.\n  Let me be clear, I don't support sanctions as a panacea for every \nforeign policy dispute we have with another country.\n  Each case needs to be judged on its own merits and needs to have \nsubstantive debate. Congress needs the opportunity to revisit sanctions \non other countries in a timely fashion. Indeed, next year, when the \nimport ban contained in our original bill of 2003 expires, we will have \nthe opportunity to judge any progress made by Rangoon over the next \nyear towards restoring democracy and possibly debate new sanctions \nlegislation, or let the legislation expire.\n\n  We know in some cases sanctions can be effective. I think South \nAfrica is the one case where that has proved to be the case. While \nBurma's military regime has totally failed to respect democracy, human \nrights, and the rule of law, world opinion is coming together to put \nadditional pressure on Rangoon.\n  In fact, members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, \ncalled ASEAN, from Malaysia to Singapore and Indonesia, have expressed \nconcerns about Burma assuming chairmanship of the organization next \nyear and have pushed Burma to make progress on democratic reform.\n  I, frankly, believe ASEAN's prestige and effectiveness would be \nsubstantially undermined and reduced if Burma assumed a leadership \nposition in ASEAN. More fundamentally, it would signal that ASEAN has \nbeen totally ineffective in moving this military junta toward elections \nin Burma, or any reconciliation, for that matter, with the duly elected \ngovernment led by Aung San Suu Kyi.\n  The way Senator Bill Cohen and I began this many years ago was to \ngive a period of 6 months for ASEAN to exert its influence on Burma, \nand then we gave the Secretary of State--who was then Madeleine \nAlbright--the ability to trigger these sanctions. In fact, ASEAN was \nunable to achieve any change in Burmese military behavior. So Secretary \nAlbright, at the time, triggered the sanctions.\n  In a recent op-ed in The Nation, Datuk Zaid Ibrahim, president of the \nASEAN Caucus on Burma, called on the members of ASEAN to defer Burma's \nchairmanship for 1 year and condition its assuming the chairmanship at \na later date on progress toward democracy and national reconciliation.\n  This is important. I hope the ASEAN nations defer the chairmanship. I \nhope they insist on progress. I hope they say the time has come to \nrelease Aung San Suu Kyi and to effect a democratic reconciliation to \nthis impasse.\n  Mr. Ibrahim added:\n\n       A mere facade of political reform will not lead to \n     stability and progress in Burma and will not alleviate the \n     impact throughout the region. ASEAN stands ready to assist \n     Burma, but ASEAN's good will must be met with the Burmese \n     government's political will.\n\n  I strongly agree. I hope this will be ASEAN's posture. I hope it will \nbe strong, formidable and, to the extent it can, unrelenting.\n  Of course, I would like to see ASEAN take additional measures to put \npressure on Burma, particularly since the spread of narcotics, HIV/\nAIDS, and refugees across the region can all be traced back to Rangoon.\n  Denied the most basic of human rights by the repressive regime--\nincluding education and health care--the Burmese people endure forced \nlabor, rape, and conscription. Those who dare speak out against the \nSPDC and its abuses are harassed, imprisoned, or killed. Few realize \nthere are between 600,000 and 1 million internally displaced persons in \nBurma today, with up to 1,300 political prisoners.\n  The people of Burma also face a severe epidemic of HIV infection. \nMeasures of the HIV burden are always difficult to assess, but \nestimates suggest that Burma is believed to have one of the largest HIV \nrates in Asia, with up to 1 percent of its population infected. That \namounts to a half million people. After initial and outgoing outbreaks \namong injecting drug users, HIV rates have rapidly risen among \nheterosexual men, blood donors, and are now rapidly rising among women \nand infants.\n  I believe the United States can gain additional international support \nfor change in Burma by continuing to take a leadership role on \nsanctions against this military regime. Now is not the time to turn our \nbacks on the very brave Aung San Suu Kyi and the people of Burma who \nvoted for democracy in 1990. Let's finish what we started with the \nBurmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003. I urge my colleagues to\n\n[[Page S8442]]\n\nsupport a free and democratic Burma and support the joint resolution \nrenewing import sanctions for another year.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, how much time remains in control of the \nDemocratic Senators on this resolution?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 39\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that 10 minutes of \nthat time be reserved for Senator Kennedy and that I may use such of \nthe remaining Democratic time as I consume for a statement as in \nmorning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                     Voyages of Trade and Discovery\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, 600 years ago this month, a great fleet of \nmore than 300 ships lifted anchor at Nanjing, China, on the first of 7 \nvoyages of trade and discovery. The Chinese fleet counted the largest \nwooden ships ever built, some with nine masts, massive keels of teak, \nand decks 400 feet long--you can imagine, longer than a football field.\n  The Ming Emperor gave his nearly 7-foot tall admiral orders to sail \non July 11, 1405, nearly a century before Christopher Columbus and \nVasco da Gama left Europe. And all of those European explorers' ships \ncould have fit on a single deck of one of the Chinese treasure ships. \nThe 36-foot rudder of one of the ships stood almost as tall as \nColumbus' flagship, the Nina, was long.\n  The Ming fleet carried a crew of nearly 28,000, with a medical \nofficer for every 150 souls on board. The fleets carried more than a \nmillion tons of silk, porcelain, copper coins, and spices to trade for \nthe riches of the world, on to what the Chinese called the Western \nOcean--what we call the Indian Ocean. They reached Sumatra, Ceylon, and \nIndia. They went to the Arabian peninsula and Africa's Swahili coast. \nThey made a side trip to Mecca.\n  At each port, ships with colorful prows delivered platoons of Chinese \nmerchants, ready to do business. In Siam--now Thailand--they acquired \nsandalwood, peacocks, and cardamom. In Indonesia, they acquired tin. In \nOman, they traded porcelain for frankincense, myrrh, and aloe. The \nSultan of Aden gave them zebras, lions, and ostriches. In east Africa, \nthey acquired a giraffe.\n  In 1451, one of the fleet's interpreters would write a memorial of \nthe voyages, exclaiming:\n\n       How could there be such diversity in the world?\n\n  In Sri Lanka, the admiral engraved a granite slab in Chinese, Tamil, \nand Persian, seeking blessing from Buddha, Siva, and Allah alike.\n  In the south Chinese harbor of Changle, the admiral inscribed on a \npillar:\n\n       [We] have recorded the years and months of the voyages . . \n     . in order to leave [the memory] forever.\n\n  He listed his destinations, ``altogether more than 30 countries large \nand small.''\n  He wrote of his efforts:\n\n      . . . to manifest the transforming power of virtue and to \n     treat distant people with kindness.\n\n  He wrote:\n\n       We have traversed more than 100,000 li--\n\n  That is 40,000 miles--\n\n     of immense water spaces and have beheld in the oceans huge \n     waves like mountains rising sky-high, and we have set eyes on \n     . . . regions far away hidden in a blue transparency of light \n     vapors. . . .\n\n  Today, approximately 600 years later, Chinese officials will proudly \nrecall the voyages of the Ming fleet. They will observe that Ming China \namassed one of the most powerful naval forces ever assembled, and they \nwill pointedly note that China used the fleet not for conquest but for \nbusiness and exploration, trade and diplomacy.\n  Three weeks ago, on June 24, 2005, a fleet of Chinese-made cars began \nrolling onto a ship in Guangzhou, China, bound for Europe. The fleet \ncounted cars made at a gleaming new Honda factory on the outskirts of \nthe sprawling city of 12 million souls near Hong Kong.\n\n  As reporter Keith Bradsher of the New York Times described:\n\n       At the new Honda factory . . . white robots poke and crane \n     their long, vulture-like heads into gray, half-completed car \n     bodies to perform 2,100 of the 3,000 welds needed to assemble \n     each car. Workers in white uniforms and gray caps complete \n     the rest of the welds, working as quickly as workers in \n     American factories--but earning roughly $1.50 an hour in \n     wages and benefits, compared to the $55 an hour for General \n     Motors and Ford factories in the United States.\n\n  In America, General Motors and Ford struggle to pay high health care \ncosts for autoworkers with an average age of nearly 50. In China, most \nof Honda's autoworkers are in their twenties. They do not go to the \ndoctor much, and when they do, Chinese doctors charge less than $5 for \nan office visit and a few stitches.\n  China's manufacturing companies are rapidly building wealth, and they \nhave begun to trade that wealth for the riches of the world, across the \nPacific Ocean.\n  At airports throughout the world, airplanes with colorful tail wings \ndeliver platoons of Chinese merchants, ready to do business. In May, \nthe Chinese company Lenovo acquired the personal computer division of \nIBM. In June, a Chinese company bid $2.25 billion for the Iowa-based \nappliance company Maytag. Also in June, China National Offshore Oil \nCorporation bid $18.5 billion for Los Angeles-based Unocal, whose \n``76'' marketing symbol is one of the most recognized and enduring \ncorporate symbols in America. And all this buying pales next to the \nacquisition by China's central bank of $230 billion of American \nGovernment debt.\n  China is pursuing trade agreements with India, Australia, New \nZealand, and Thailand. China is reaching out to the 10 countries of the \nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations, known as ASEAN.\n  The Chinese are visiting the rest of Asia in greater numbers than \nbefore. They bring with them money and optimism about the ``new \nChina.'' The new China has gleaming skyscrapers, modern, productive \nindustries, and a rapidly developing infrastructure.\n  China has launched a major charm offensive across Asia to promote \nitself as a desirable place to visit, to invest, and to live. Through \nventures such as China Radio International, worldwide television \nbroadcasts, and Chinese language and cultural centers across Asia, \nChina advertises itself as an attractive destination. Increasingly, \nAsians are forgoing trips to Los Angeles, traveling to Beijing instead. \nFor many young Asians, the gleaming lights of Shanghai illuminate the \nnew Manhattan.\n  Already 90 million people in China's coastal cities have access to \nthe Internet, and the Chinese own more cell phones than any other \npeople in the world. There are more cell phones in China than there are \npeople in the United States.\n  China has the world's largest population, the fastest growing \neconomy, the second largest foreign currency reserves, and the third \nlargest trade. China creates one-fifth of world trade growth.\n  In 2004, America exported 2\\1/2\\ times more to China than it did in \n1999, 5 years earlier. My State of Montana exported 11\\1/2\\ times more. \nBut America's merchandise trade deficit with China has more than \ndoubled in the same time. China accounted for a quarter of America's \n$652 billion trade deficit last year.\n  As Tom Friedman writes in his book, ``The World is Flat,'' which I \nrecommend for everyone:\n\n       [W]hat is really scary is that China is not attracting so \n     much global investment by simply racing everyone to the \n     bottom. . . . China's long-term strategy is to outrace \n     America and the EU countries to the top, and the Chinese are \n     off to a good start.\n\n  China is amassing one of the most powerful economies ever assembled. \nSo America must ask: Will the result be as benign as the voyages of the \nMing treasure fleet 600 years ago?\n  Asia accounts for one-third of the world economy. It is the world's \nmost economically dynamic region. And America needs to pay attention. \nThis administration has launched 20 free-trade agreements, but only one \nhas been in Asia--with Thailand.\n  Instead of embracing ASEAN, this administration has largely ignored \nit. The Government has ceded the initiative in Southeast Asia to China. \nThat is how ASEAN views the recent decisions of Secretary of State Rice \nto skip an important ASEAN gathering later this month. U.S. Secretaries \nof State have traditionally attended that conference. And this \nadministration has failed to use the Asia Pacific Economic\n\n[[Page S8443]]\n\nCooperation, otherwise known as APEC, as a platform for trade \nintegration. Rather, this administration has turned the organization \ninto little more than a venue to discuss security options.\n  Since 2000, this administration has negotiated bilateral and regional \ntrade agreements at a furious pace, but most of the agreements the \nGovernment has been negotiating offer little real value to America's \ncommercial interests. Why? Because the Government is choosing trading \npartners more for foreign policy reasons than it is for commercial \nreasons.\n  The U.S. Trade representative has finite resources. To be effective, \nto deliver the greatest benefits to Americans, our Government must \ndirect their efforts where they are most likely to have the greatest \neffects.\n  In 1962, Congress created the Special Trade Representative--the \npredecessor of the U.S. Trade Representative--to remove trade policy \nfrom the State Department precisely so that commercial interests rather \nthan foreign policy interests would drive American trade policy. I \ndon't think that has happened. I believe trade shots are called by the \nWhite House.\n  We must focus trade policy efforts where they promise the greatest \nreturn for our ranchers, businesses, and our workers. First and \nforemost, we need to devote more effort to the ongoing Doha round of \nWTO negotiations. From all appearances, the negotiations are dragging. \nThe pace of progress will have to improve considerably to meet the goal \nof an agreement by the end of 2006, and that will require a substantial \ncommitment of U.S. leadership and resources.\n  We need to look more to Asia for bilateral agreements as well. For \nexample, South Korea is our seventh largest trading partner, with a \ntwo-way trade totaling $70 billion. Korea has promised real reforms in \nits agricultural markets. It has liberalized investment restrictions \nand lowered merchandise tariffs. I have met with Korean trade officials \non several occasions, and they are serious about reforms.\n  Regional trade agreements in Asia, perhaps under the auspices of \nAPEC, also hold promise. APEC's 21-member economies account for a third \nof the world's population and about three-fifths of world production. \nAmerican exporters will get a major boost from a regional free-trade \nagreement on this scale.\n  We also need to seek out further sectoral agreements such as the \nWTO's hugely successful Information Technology Agreement negotiated \nlargely by America, Japan, and Singapore.\n  We should launch an initiative in the advanced medical equipment \nsector. Asia has a rapidly aging population, particularly in Japan, \nKorea, and China. This demographic shift translates into growing demand \nfor advanced medical equipment. America already exports half a billion \ndollars a year in medical devices to China and Hong Kong, and these \nexports are expanding 12 percent a year.\n  We need to do a better job of enforcing our existing trade \nagreements.\n  In China, piracy--the theft of American copyrights and patents--is at \nepidemic levels. In the past 2 years, companies from General Motors to \nSony to Cisco have complained that Chinese have stolen their \nintellectual property. More than 90 percent of software in China is \nstolen. American innovators are losing billions of dollars a year.\n  Combating piracy would help the American economy far more than \nfurther agreements with countries whose entire economies are but a \nfraction the size of our losses to piracy alone. I need only mention \nCAFTA. CAFTA is a blip compared to other commercial interests we should \nbe pursuing.\n  China also maintains a troubling currency peg. But retaliatory \ntariffs are not the answer. Tariffs would violate our WTO commitments. \nTariffs would inflame already difficult trade relations with China, \ninvite Chinese retaliation in other areas, and make Chinese imports \nnearly a third more expensive. Tariffs would hurt American consumers \nwho would pay more for many of the goods that they buy. And tariffs \nwould hurt U.S. companies who rely on Chinese inputs to develop their \nown products.\n  Having said that, China's currency peg is a problem. It distorts \nworld markets and hurts both America and China itself. China needs to \nrevise its currency policy.\n  While issues with China dominate the headlines, there are other \nenforcement priorities, including in our own hemisphere. In Brazil for \nexample, the government recently forced an American pharmaceutical \ncompany to reduce its price for one of its medicines. It did so by \nthreatening to break its promise to protect the American company's \npatent, and to let a state-owned company make generic copies of the \nmedicine, an outrage.\n  This is blackmail, pure and simple. And it is illegal. This sort of \ncoercion has no place in our trade relations. It hurts our companies \nand our workers. And it dampens the incentive to create new and \ninnovative pharmaceuticals.\n  Our problems with Brazil go beyond just pharmaceuticals. Until \nrecently, Brazil banned the sale of genetically engineered seeds for \nuse in agriculture. These are the kind of high-tech seeds American \ncompanies like Monsanto and Pioneer Hi-Bred develop and sell all over \nthe world--but not in Brazil. How odd then, that roughly 30 percent of \nBrazil's soybeans are grown with genetically engineered seeds. The \nfigure is nearly 90 percent in Brazil's southernmost state of Rio \nGrande do Sul.\n  How can this be? Theft. These seeds were smuggled in from neighboring \ncountries where they are allowed, and planted illegally. They were not \npurchased. They were stolen.\n  And just like piracy in China, piracy in Brazil costs American \nindustries dearly. Last year, American companies lost $930 million in \nBrazil because of piracy of audiovisual goods. Some estimate that \nthree-quarters of these audiocassettes sold in Brazil are pirated.\n  Of course we cannot launch a full-fledged WTO dispute to address each \nand every foreign trade barrier. And the U.S. Trade Representative \noften rightly attempts to resolve many of these issues through \nnegotiation and other means.\n\n  But there can be little doubt that trade enforcement has received a \nlower priority of late. In the 6 years from 1995 through 2000, the \nUnited States filed 67 WTO dispute settlement cases. In the 5 years \nsince, we have filed only 12. That is about an 80 percent decrease.\n  Too often, our tools to address trade barriers are lying unused, on \nthe shelf. That burdens Americans with economic losses. But what is \nmore, when Americans see that others are cheating, their enthusiasm for \ntrade cools. And we all suffer as a result.\n  Americans also cool to trade when they see nothing being done to help \nthose who lose from trade. Lowering tariffs and barriers increases \ncompetition and benefits many more than it hurts, but it inevitably \nhurts some.\n  For more than 40 years, the Government has been helping to retrain \nworkers affected by trade to give them the skills that they need to \nfind new jobs. These programs were expanded in 2002 under the Trade \nAdjustment Assistance Reform Act, a bipartisan effort and one of my \nproudest achievements as chairman of the Finance Committee at that \ntime. The reforms expanded eligibility to new categories of workers, \ncreated a new health coverage tax credit, and helped older workers with \na new wage insurance benefit. Last year, these programs helped nearly \n150,000 workers.\n  TAA is an integral part of a successful trade policy. A few weeks \nago, I discussed this very issue with Federal Reserve Chairman Alan \nGreenspan during a Finance Committee hearing. Chairman Greenspan \nstated, as he has before, that our trade policy should ``assist those \nwho are on the wrong side of the adjustment'' caused by trade.\n  Lately, the Government has not supported TAA. This year, the \nadministration's budget zeroed out funding for the TAA for Firms \nProgram, which pretty much everyone agrees has been useful and cost \neffective. Last month, the Senate Finance Committee passed an amendment \noffered by my colleague from Oregon, Senator Wyden, to extend TAA \nbenefits to workers in the service industry. The administration \nstripped the language out of the CAFTA implementing bill that it \nsubmitted to the Congress.\n  Liberalizing trade requires a grand bargain with workers. Workers \nagree to be exposed to increased international competition It is \nhelpful. But society agrees to erect a strong social safety net to help \nworkers adjust.\n\n[[Page S8444]]\n\nWhen workers' old skills become obsolete, society helps them learn new \nskills to compete. If we undercut this bargain, we do so at the peril \nof further trade liberalization and our international competitiveness.\n  We must press forward with trade liberalization. For, 600 years \nlater, international trade remains as vital to the world economy today \nas it was to Ming China.\n  Trade allows Americans to specialize in what we do best. That allows \nus to improve our international competitiveness and maximize our \nstandard of living.\n  What Americans do best today is manufacture capital-intensive goods: \nairplanes, automobiles, and construction equipment.\n  Americans invent whole new fields, like biotech and nanotechnology, \nthat lead to new products to make our lives better. University of \nMichigan scientists recently used nanotechnology to deliver a powerful \ndrug inside cancerous tumor cells, increasing the drug's cancer-killing \nactivity and reducing its toxic side effects.\n  Americans pioneer new services to make our lives better, like \nInternet banking. We export our services all over the world. Hollywood \nmovies and American television programs are translated into countless \nlanguages and watched around the world. American universities educate \nstudents from virtually every country on Earth. American insurance \ncompanies insure assets in jungles, deserts, and savannas.\n  And American ranchers and farmers feed and clothe people around the \nglobe.\n  Freer trade helps us find and open new markets for what Americans do \nbest. New markets provide new opportunities for American workers and \ntheir companies. New markets mean greater demand for what Americans \nproduce. And new markets mean more jobs and more investment \nopportunities to meet the demand.\n  As we meet the demand of foreign consumers through trade, American \nproducts become global products. American brands become global brands. \nCoke is Coke, the world over.\n  I might digress and say 40 years ago I hitchhiked around the world \nwith a knapsack on my back in northern Ghana. I went to a little hut. I \ngot off from the back of a truck. I was riding with the cattle in the \nback of the truck. My driver stopped to pray. He pointed his little \nprayer mat toward Mecca. In that little hut there was a little \nrefrigerator, no electricity, and there was Coca-Cola. It was a world \nbrand back then. Just think of all the world brands we could have \ntoday. On today's voyages, one can find the familiar yellow arches of \nMcDonald's in Cyprus, Slovenia, and Oman.\n\n  The American standard becomes the global standard and the \ninternational sign of excellence. Excellence means that half of the \nworld's 20 largest companies are American companies--companies like \nCitigroup, IBM, and General Electric.\n  Importing products from our trading partners challenges domestic \ncompanies to compete. Competition keeps American companies nimble. \nAmerican companies are constantly coming up with new products and \nbetter ways to make them.\n  Just look at the number of U.S. patents filed by Americans versus the \nrest of the world. Americans filed nearly 90,000 patents in 2003. That \nis 50,000 more than the next most innovative country, Japan. In \ninnovation, we are still number one.\n  The biggest payoff from international trade goes to the American \nconsumer. As more and more companies trade and produce what they are \nbest at producing, prices in supermarkets and department stores \nplummet. Cheaper products mean that we can afford more of what we need, \nand our standard of living improves.\n  The now-ubiquitous cell phone provides a great example. Ten years \nago, it was an unaffordable luxury for most Americans. Using one in \npublic aroused curiosity, but trade forced prices to drop. Now many \nAmericans see cell phones as a necessity.\n  Leaders have not always appreciated the benefits of trade. After the \nstock market crash in 1929, America enacted the Tariff Act of 1930. \nThat act imposed the now-infamous Smoot-Hawley tariffs that deepened \nthe Great Depression.\n  During the Presidential campaign of 1932, President Hoover warned \nthat repealing the Smoot-Hawley tariffs would devastate the U.S. \neconomy, why? Because Americans could not compete successfully with \nworkers in poorer countries with lower wages and lower costs of \nproduction. It was Franklin Roosevelt who argued that worldwide \nreduction of trade barriers would benefit both America and its trading \npartners.\n  Roosevelt's victory, along with his signing of the Reciprocal Trade \nAgreements Act, ushered in the modern era of American trade policy.\n  During World War II, Secretary of State Cordell Hull argued that \neconomic protectionism had fed the animosities that led to the war. He \nadvocated freer trade in the postwar era as a bulwark for peace and \nprosperity.\n  This vision led to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, \notherwise known as GATT, negotiated during the Truman administration. \nThis forerunner to today's World Trade Organization brought down the \ndisastrously high Smoot-Hawley tariffs and freed $10 billion of trade \nfrom duties.\n  Democrats can be proud of our role in expanding free trade. \nDemocratic administrations completed and implemented the last three \nrounds of GATT negotiations. In 1967, the Johnson \nadministration completed the Kennedy Round. In 1979, the Carter \nadministration completed the Tokyo Round. In 1994, the Clinton \nadministration completed the Uruguay Round.\n\n  The Clinton administration completed the North American Free Trade \nAgreement, negotiated the historic bilateral trade agreement with \nVietnam, and granted permanent normal trade relations to China, \nultimately paving the way for China's membership in the WTO.\n  The success of trade liberalization has been spectacular, touching \nthe lives and well-being of all Americans. Freer trade has lowered our \ntariffs from about 40 percent in 1946 to about 4 percent today, and \nmade our trading partners do the same. Freer trade has increased our \nnational income by nearly $1 trillion a year. Freer trade has increased \nthe average American household's income by nearly $10,000 a year. Freer \ntrade with China alone saves American households $600 each year.\n  Today, 12 million Americans, 1 of every 10 workers, depend on exports \nfor their jobs. International trade now accounts for a quarter of our \ngross domestic product, up from just 10 percent in the 1950s.\n  Trade opens our lives to new opportunities and choices. Trade gives \nus new foods to eat, new movies to watch, and new products to buy.\n  Strengthening trade ties also contributes to peaceful relations with \nour trading partners. Our quality of life improves as the world grows \never smaller, shrinking with the better communications and \ntransportation links that develop with increased commerce.\n  Back in China, Guangzhou Airport has a terminal designed by an \nAmerican company, boarding gates supplied by a Danish company, and an \nair traffic control tower engineered by a company from Singapore.\n  America's Dell Computers is giving the Chinese competitor Lenovo a \nrun for its money in China. Dell now has become China's third-largest \nseller of PCs, and Dell now produces 3 million PCs in China, as many as \nLenovo.\n  America should welcome China's greater integration into the world \nmarket. It may mean that we will have to work a little harder, study a \nlittle bit harder, and think a little bit quicker to keep ahead. But \nthose are talents at which Americans excel.\n  In the middle of the 15th century, China made an abrupt change in \nforeign policy. Remember just earlier all those ships around the world? \nChina turned inward and abandoned outward-looking trade. Imperial \nedicts banned overseas travel. To reduce commerce with foreign nations, \nthe new Chinese dynasty burned a swath of land 30 miles deep for 700 \nmiles of its southern coast. Any merchant caught engaging in foreign \ntrade was tried as a pirate and executed.\n  With the Emperor's death in 1435, the government put a stop to the \nvoyages of the Treasure fleet. Chinese court officials destroyed the \nplans for the Treasure ships, the accounts of their\n\n[[Page S8445]]\n\nvoyages, and almost every map and document of the previous period. \nSadly, China's golden Ming age came to an end, China's economy fell \nbackward, and the treasure ships became shrouded in the mists of \nhistory.\n  We cannot yet know whether the voyages of today's fleets of Chinese \nships will lead to another golden age for China like that of the Ming \nDynasty. But we also cannot expect that China will somehow once again \nabruptly reverse course and turn inward. That will not happen.\n  Try as regimes after the Ming dynasty did, they could not erase the \nhistory of the Ming treasure fleets, whose voyages will leave a memory \nforever.\n  Let us respond to today's Chinese fleets with the best spirit of the \nMing admiral, and the best spirit of America.\n  Let us work to advance freer trade, so that for America and for \nChina, we can, in the words of the Ming admiral, ``manifest the \ntransforming power of virtue.''\n  Let us work to advance freer trade, to make a better world both for \nourselves, and for ``regions far away hidden in a blue transparency of \nlight vapors.''\n  And let us work to advance freer trade, because both in terms of new \ninnovations and new trading partners, America's greatest voyages of \ndiscovery still lie ahead of her.\n  Mr. President, under the previous order, do we have up to 10 minutes \nreserved for the Senator from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. VITTER). The Senator is correct. The \nSenator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I see my friend and colleague from Arizona on the floor. \nI understand by previous agreement we are voting at 12:20, so I am glad \nto divide the time that is remaining.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. If the Senator from Massachusetts will yield for a \nmoment, I believe I have the last amount of time before the vote. I ask \nthe Chair, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky has 18\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I will not likely use the entire 18\\1/2\\ minutes. The \nvote is scheduled to begin at the end of the time, or do we have a time \nspecific for the vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At the end of the time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Fine. I will proceed then for my 10 because I understand \nthere will be adequate time for the others.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent my statement appear at an \nappropriate part of the debate on this issue.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Kennedy are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, on the matter before the Senate today, \nthe Burma sanctions, I want to point out that this legislation \naddresses one of the worst human rights tragedies in the world, the \natrocious acts of the Burmese junta. They suppress dissent. They jail \nopponents. They deny the basic rights of free speech, freedom of \nreligion, and freedom of assembly, and they have had Aung San Suu Kyi \nunder house arrest for many years. So the action we take today is \nappropriate.\n  I am proud Massachusetts has led the way to encourage sanctions \nagainst this abusive government. In 1996, the Massachusetts legislature \nadopted a law barring State agencies from doing business with companies \nthat do business with Burma. It was the first step toward national \naction.\n  I hope our Senate colleagues will support this measure here today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank Senators McConnell and Feinstein for their \nleadership in renewing the sanctions contained in the 2003 Burmese \nFreedom and Democracy Act. I am proud to cosponsor this legislation.\n  As we renew the sanctions, I note with sadness that the situation \ninside Burma grows ever dimmer. The military junta in that country \ncontrols the population through a campaign of violence and terror, and \nthe lack of freedom and justice there is simply appalling. The Burmese \nregime has murdered political opponents, used child soldiers, and \nforced labor, and employed rape as a weapon of war. Political activists \nremain in prison, including elected members of Parliament, and last \nmonth the courageous woman Aung San Suu Kyi celebrated her 60th \nbirthday in captivity. Her resolve in the face of tyranny inspires me \nand I believe every individual who holds democracy dear. Because she \nstands for freedom, this heroic woman has endured attacks, arrest, \ncaptivity, and untold sufferings at the hands of the regime. Burma's \nrulers fear Aung San Suu Kyi because of what she represents: peace, \nfreedom, and justice for all Burmese people. The thugs who run the \ncountry have tried to stifle her voice, but they will never extinguish \nher moral courage. Her leadership and example shine brightly for the \nmillions of Burmese who hunger for freedom and those of us outside \nBurma who seek justice for its people.\n  I know my friend from Kentucky has been very involved in this issue. \nI ask unanimous consent the Senator from Kentucky and I engage in a \nbrief colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Kentucky is recognized along with the Senator from \nArizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I again thank my friend and colleague from Kentucky for \nhis commitment to democracy and freedom in Burma in general and his \ncontinuing advocacy on behalf of this Nobel Prize winner and truly \ngreat citizen of the world.\n  One of the issues I would like to discuss with the Senator from \nKentucky is the fact that a few years ago, Burma was allowed into ASEAN \non the premise that there would be some kind of progress made and by \nbeing part of this organization they would seek some kind of \nlegitimacy.\n  Now, apparently, next year ASEAN is scheduled to meet in Burma. I \nwondered about the Senator's thoughts about that. Maybe we should give \nthat some more attention as the time approaches.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank my friend from Arizona for bringing it up.\n  Let me point out to my colleagues that the Senator from Arizona has \nactually had an opportunity to meet Aung San Suu Kyi. I heard him say \nbefore what an inspirational experience that was. I wish I had the \nopportunity to actually meet her at some point. As the Senator from \nArizona pointed out, she basically has been under house arrest for some \n15 years.\n  This outrageous regime in Burma is scheduled, as the Senator from \nArizona pointed out, to host in Rangoon the ASEAN meeting in 2006. It \nwill be an interesting test of whether the policies of the governments \nin ASEAN, which basically add up to constructive engagement, will be \nhonored even through that, and everybody will go traipsing to a meeting \nin Rangoon.\n  I had an opportunity to have a few words with the Prime Minister of \nIndia. They, like ourselves, abhor the regime there and revere Suu Kyi \nbut nevertheless pursue this policy of constructive engagement. Maybe \nthe scheduled meeting in Rangoon will be a way to bring this whole \nissue to a head and move the governments in the area in the direction \nof some kind of policy other than constructive engagement. Obviously, \nthis policy is not going to work. I share the Senator's view.\n  It is unacceptable for ASEAN to meet in Rangoon while this regime is \nin power and Suu Kyi is in jail.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my friend for his continued sponsorship for and \nrenewal of the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act. I believe it has had \nan effect inside Burma. I do believe the people who are in prisons and \nmistreated, as well as San Suu Kyi herself, are aware of our efforts on \ntheir behalf.\n  I thank my friend from Kentucky for his continued efforts on behalf \nof these people. I believe we should continue to ask that one day they \nwill achieve their freedom--not if, but when. I think the Senator's \nefforts and our passage of this legislation will help get them there. I \nlook forward to exploring other options and ways we can put continued \npressure on this bunch of thugs to at least allow this brave woman a \nchance to live some semblance of a normal life. She certainly deserves \nit.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I make a further observation to my good friend from \nArizona. The Prime Minister of India mentioned a meeting that Than \nShwe, the head thug of the thug regime that controls Burma, apparently \ncame to in New Delhi sometime within the last\n\n[[Page S8446]]\n\nyear. One of the arguments he made with reference to reform was that \nBurma was so ethnically diverse that it simply could not handle \ndemocracy. I am sure my friend from Arizona shares my view of the irony \nof that. What could be a more ethnically diverse country than India?\n  No one knows this, but India is the second-largest Muslim country in \nthe world, whose President is a Muslim and has had a total democracy by \nWestern standards these many years, going back to independence. India \nhas done a superb job of absorbing all of these different minorities, \nmany of whom do not speak the same language, into a genuine democracy \nfor over 50 years.\n  India itself is a repudiation of the argument that the head thug was \nusing against any kind of reform in Burma.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I know my friend from Kentucky and the \nSenator from California and all Members will renew our assurance to the \npeople of Burma and their brave leader that we will not rest and we \nwill not stop until they achieve freedom and democracy, which is a God-\ngiven right.\n  I thank my colleague from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank, again, the Senator from Arizona for his \ncontinuous interest and outspoken involvement in this issue over the \nyears. It has been fun to be in collaboration with him.\n  I will say a few words on Burma before the Senate votes, and at the \nend of my remarks I will ask for the yeas and nays on the measure to \nrenew sanctions for another year on Burma.\n  These sanctions are absolutely necessary. If you do not want to take \nmy word for it, here is what a Thai journalist wrote in a recent \nopinion piece in that country's newspaper called the Nation:\n\n       Whatever momentum was gained from the international calls \n     to free Aung San Suu Kyi and to allow for democracy in Burma \n     on the occasion of the opposition leader's recent 60th \n     birthday must be sustained at all costs. The outpouring of \n     support from presidents, prime ministers, intellectuals, \n     Nobel laureates and activists demonstrated one simple truth--\n     the Lady matters. Contrary to conventional wisdom, \n     perpetuated by junta apologists and other vested interests in \n     the past five years, that the long-suffering opposition \n     leader of the National League for Democracy has been the main \n     stumbling block of progress because of her attitude toward \n     political processes and national reconciliation, Suu Kyi is \n     in fact loved and respected by the Burmese and other people \n     around the world.\n\n  He had it right. The Lady matters.\n  Under the paranoid misrule of Burmese hard-liner Than Shwe, the human \nrights and dignity of the Burmese people continue to be grossly abused. \nThe litany of atrocities--from the use of rape as a weapon of war to \nthe murder, torture and intimidation of political activists--are well-\nknown and well-documented. It seems as though the only ones denying \nthat a problem exists in Burma are the very miscreants responsible for \ncreating and propagating that problem.\n  Second, with the SPDC scheduled to assume chairmanship of the \nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations, ASEAN, next year, as Senator \nMcCain and I were just discussing, the time has come for ASEAN to fish \nor cut bait.\n  Again, listen to what others from that region are saying, such as \nformer deputy prime minister of Malaysia Anwar Ibrahim who wrote last \nmonth in the Asian Wall Street Journal:\n\n     . . . It is now evident that constructive engagement [by \n     ASEAN with the SPDC] has not only failed to bring about \n     democratization, but was never seriously intended to \n     encourage any move in this direction. Instead, as far as \n     ASEAN is concerned, the policy amounts to a subconscious \n     manifestation of collective guilt.\n\n  I offer that the absence of Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice at \nthe recent security meeting in Laos portends America's involvement with \nASEAN should the SPDC be at the helm. The difference might be that no \nAmerican official attends ASEAN events in her stead.\n  In case ASEAN members have not noticed, President Bush is a stalwart \nsupporter of freedom in Burma.\n  As is Secretary Rice. As is the U.S. Congress.\n  My colleagues may recall that 14 Nobel laureates wrote an open letter \non the occasion of Suu Kyi's 60th birthday, which applauded ``those \ncountries that have imposed sanctions to deny the regime the wealth it \ncraves to sustain itself'' and reminded the world that ``Burma was \nadmitted to ASEAN to lift its people up, not to drag the organization \ndown.'' ASEAN members should feel similarly--how could they not?\n  Finally, the world must press for the immediate and unconditional \nrelease of Burmese democracy activists Aung San Suu Kyi and all \nprisoners of conscience.\n  Suu Kyi, the National League for Democracy and Burma's ethnic \nminorities have an indisputable role to play in the peaceful \nreconciliation of that country's myriad problems. This role cannot, and \nwill not, be fulfilled so long as these courageous individuals remain \nbehind prison walls or in the gun sights of SPDC goons.\n  Earlier today we had an opportunity to hear India's Prime Minister \naddress a joint meeting of Congress.\n  In my discussion with Senator McCain in the Senate, I just pointed \nout the Indian Government certainly does not approve of the regime. I \nquestioned the policy of the constructive engagement of India. They are \nat least thinking about whether that is the appropriate policy in India \nfor the future. It was interesting and noteworthy the Prime Minister of \nIndia happened to be here on the very same day we took this measure up.\n  I particularly thank Senator McCain, Senators Feinstein, Reid, Frist, \nand Leahy, to name but a few, who have been involved in this issue from \nthe beginning. This is an important statement of principle for America. \nI urge my colleagues to support this measure overwhelmingly.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise today in support of H.R. 3057, the \nForeign Operations appropriation bill. I would also like to highlight \none aspect of the bill.\n  Since coming to the Senate 6 months ago, one of the foreign policy \nand health issues I have focused on relates to the avian flu. I am \npleased that this bill includes $10 million to combat the spread of \nthis potential pandemic, adding to the $25 million that the Senate \nprovided in the supplemental appropriations bill in April.\n  I thank the managers of this bill, Senators McConnell and Leahy, and \ntheir staffs for working with me on this important issue. I know that \nSenator McConnell has a longstanding interest in Southeast Asia, and \nSenator Leahy has always been a champion of international health \nissues, making the avian flu something I know they both care deeply \nabout.\n  In the last few weeks, scientists have reported that a deadlier \nversion of the avian flu has now spread to migrant birds that could \ncarry the disease out of Asia and across the world.\n  While it may not seem that threatening to many Americans at first, \nthis bird flu could easily transform into a human flu. And if it does, \nit could be one of the deadliest flus mankind has ever known--even \nworse than the 1918 flu pandemic that killed 675,000 Americans and 50 \nmillion worldwide.\n  Already, there have been 108 human cases of avian flu, resulting in \n54 deaths. And while the virus has not yet mutated into a full-blown \nhuman flu, recent developments suggest it might be heading in that \ndirection. In recent months, the virus has been detected in mammals \nthat have never previously been infected, including tigers, leopards \nand cats.\n  A few weeks ago, the World Health Organization reported that avian \nflu strains in Vietnam are lasting longer and spreading to more humans. \nAnd according to government officials, a few cases of human-to-human \nspread have already occurred.\n  Every day, there are new reports about the increasing dangers of the \navian flu. Last month, it was revealed that Chinese farmers have tried \nto suppress outbreaks of the avian flu by using human antiviral drugs \non infected animals.\n  As a result, one strain of the virus has become resistant to these \ndrugs, thus making the drugs ineffective in protecting humans against a \npossible pandemic. And just this week, researchers found that ducks \ninfected with the virus were contagious for up to 17 days, causing the \nanimals to become--in the researchers' words--``medical Trojan horses'' \nfor transmitting the disease to humans.\n  Simply put, the world is not ready for a potential outbreak of this \ndeadly flu. In fact, we aren't even close.\n  There is no known vaccine for the avian flu, and producing one could \ntake months once an outbreak occurs. And while the World Health \nOrganization recommends that every nation stockpiles enough flu \ntreatment to treat a quarter of its population, the United States has \nonly ordered enough to treat less than 1 percent of ours.\n  We can't just stand by and hope that this virus doesn't reach our \nshores when it only takes hours to travel from one side of the world to \nthe other. It is time for America to lead the world in taking decisive \naction to prevent a potential global tragedy.\n  We should start by doing what we can to fight the virus while it is \nstill mainly in Southeast Asia. That is why I fought for and obtained \n$25 million for prevention efforts by the CDC, the Agency for \nInternational Development, the Health and Human Services Department, \nand other agencies. And that is why I requested another $10 million in \nthis bill.\n  In addition, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved language \nthat I offered directing President Bush to form a senior-level task \nforce to devise an international strategy to deal with the avian flu \nand coordinate policy among our government agencies. I hope that the \nBush administration forms this task force immediately without waiting \nfor legislation to be passed.\n  Yet, these are only modest first steps. International health experts \nbelieve that Southeast Asia will be an epicenter of influenza for \ndecades. That is why we need to create a permanent framework for \ncurtailing the spread of future infectious diseases--a framework that \nwould increase international disease surveillance, response capacity \nand public education and coordination, especially in Southeast Asia.\n  But we must also prepare our own country in the event that a global \npandemic reaches America. That is why I recently introduced the AVIAN \nAct, which helps make sure that Americans are protected from a possible \noutbreak of the avian flu.\n  When the threat is this real, we should be increasing research into \npossible flu vaccines, and we should be ordering enough doses of flu \ntreatment to cover the recommended 25 percent of our population--just \nlike England and other Western countries have done.\n  We should also ensure that our Health and Human Services Department \nand State governments put in place a plan as to how they would address \na potential flu pandemic, including the purchasing and distributing of \nvaccines. A year after a draft of a Federal plan was published, a final \nversion has yet to be finalized. We shouldn't have to wait any longer, \nbecause the avian flu certainly won't.\n  We are extremely fortunate that so far, the avian flu has not been \nfound in the United States. But in an age when you can board planes in \nBangkok or Hong Kong and arrive in Chicago, Burlington or Louisville in \nhours, we must face the reality that these exotic killer diseases are \nnot isolated health problems half a world away, but direct and \nimmediate threats to security and prosperity here at home.\n  Again, I thank Senators McConnell and Leahy for including this \nimportant funding in the supplemental appropriations bill and now \nincluding additional funding in this bill. And I thank the \ndistinguished chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator \nLugar, for his leadership on this issue.\n  I ask unanimous consent that several articles and editorials about \nthe avian flu be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, July 18, 2005]\n\n                  Avian Flu Virus Could Hide in Ducks\n\n                       (By the Associated Press)\n\n       Washington (AP).--Changes in the avian flu virus have made \n     it less deadly to ducks, potentially turning them into \n     medical Trojan horses where the flu can hide while continuing \n     to infect other birds and humans.\n       Waterfowl such as ducks have been natural hosts of this \n     type of influenza before but rarely became ill from it until \n     2002, when an evolving strain killed off a large number of \n     the birds.\n       Since then, however, the virus has continued to change, \n     reverting to a form less dangerous to ducks but still able to \n     cause illness and death in chickens and humans, according to \n     a study in Tuesday's issue of Proceedings of the National \n     Academy of Sciences.\n       ``These results suggest that the duck has become the Trojan \n     horse of Asian H5Nl influenza viruses,'' reported a research \n     team led by Robert G. Webster of St. Jude Children's Research \n     Hospital in Memphis, Tenn.\n       ``The ducks that are unaffected by these viruses continue \n     to circulate these viruses, presenting a pandemic threat,'' \n     the team said.\n       The researchers infected domestic ducks with flu isolated \n     at various times.\n       They found that ducks infected with H5Nl from 2003 or 2004 \n     were contagious for 11-17 days, a longer transmission time \n     than pre-2002 strains. The researchers also noted that the \n     virus was transmitted primarily through the upper respiratory \n     tract instead of through fecal matter as in older strains.\n       When flu virus from ducks that had survived the disease was \n     administered to healthy animals, it no longer caused disease\n\n[[Page S8448]]\n\n     in ducks, but still caused disease in chickens.\n       Over the last two years, hundreds of millions of birds, \n     including poultry and wild birds, have died or were \n     slaughtered across Asia because of the H5Nl bird flu virus, \n     which has also infected some humans, killing 51 people in \n     Vietnam, Thailand and Cambodia.\n       The humans appear to have been infected by contact with \n     birds. Experts fear that if the virus mutates into a form \n     that could be passed easily from person to person it could \n     spark a global pandemic, killing millions.\n       Webster's research was funded by the U.S. Public Health \n     Service and American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, July 7, 2005]\n\n             Deadly Flu Strain Shows Up in Migratory Birds\n\n\nScientists' Discovery Gives Rise to Fears the Virus Could Spread Beyond \n                               East Asia\n\n                            (By David Brown)\n\n       The strain of bird flu responsible for the deaths of tens \n     of millions of chickens and 54 people in east Asia over the \n     past two years is now circulating in long-distance migratory \n     birds, potentially opening a way for the deadly virus to \n     reach India, Australia and Europe.\n       That is the conclusion of two research teams whose findings \n     were rushed into print by the rival journals Science and \n     Nature yesterday.\n       Spread of the virus beyond its current home in China and \n     neighboring countries could cause billions of dollars in \n     losses to poultry farmers around the world. It could also \n     give influenza A/H5N1--the virus's formal name--further \n     ,opportunity to adapt to human as well as avian hosts, a \n     development that theoretically could lead to a global flu \n     epidemic.\n       Until now, the H5N1 virus has chiefly attacked chickens and \n     ducks in farms and markets. It also killed a small number of \n     birds in two Hong Kong nature parks in late 2002, and since \n     then has been found sporadically in hawks, herons and swans. \n     Those birds presumably acquired it from direct contact with \n     poultry.\n       Now, however, it appears the virus is being transmitted \n     among wild birds that have had no known contact with \n     domesticated birds.\n       ``It has been difficult to tell whether the true migrating \n     birds had been infected by this terrible virus. This leaves \n     no doubt in my mind,'' said Robert G. Webster, a flu \n     virologist at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in \n     Memphis who helped analyze virus samples collected during a \n     recent die-off of birds at a huge saltwater lake in western \n     China.\n       Since the first reports emerged on April 30, between 1,000 \n     and 6,000 birds have died on the shores and islands of remote \n     Qinghai Lake. The species most affected is the bar-headed \n     goose, a large bird whose migration over the Himalayas to \n     Burma, India and Pakistan starts in about a month. Illness \n     and death were also recorded in brown-headed gulls, black-\n     headed gulls and great cormorants.\n       There is a web of migratory flyways around the globe. The \n     ones taken by the species congregating at Qinghai Lake \n     intersect with others that lead to Europe. That theoretically \n     provides a way for the H5N1 virus to reach that continent.\n       H5N1 influenza virus was first detected in southern China \n     in 1996. In 1997, it caused a major outbreak in Hong Kong, \n     which led to the death of 1.5 million poultry and six people.\n       The virus most recently emerged in South Korea in late \n     2003. Since then, it has led to the death of 100 million to \n     200 million chickens in China and Southeast Asia. It has also \n     infected 108 people (most of them in Vietnam), of whom 54--\n     exactly half--have died. Most human victims had direct \n     contact with dead or dying chickens, but in a few cases it \n     appears the virus was acquired directly from an infected \n     person.\n       While person-to-person spread of H5N1 influenza is rare and \n     occurs with difficulty, the more the virus circulates the \n     greater its chance of acquiring genetic changes that permit \n     easy human transmission.\n       If that occurs, the virus would have ``pandemic \n     potential''; it could travel quickly and infect much of the \n     world's population, which has no immunity to it.\n       There is no guarantee H5N1's presence in migratory birds \n     will lead to global dissemination. It simply increases the \n     chance.\n       For there to be further spread, a significant number of \n     infected birds would need to be healthy enough to start their \n     migration. They would need to establish a ``chain of \n     transmission'' in the migrating flock, with new birds \n     acquiring the virus as the infected ones died or recovered. \n     At their destinations, they would have to make contact with \n     poultry, igniting a new chicken outbreak and again putting \n     the virus into contact with human beings.\n       The likelihood of any of these steps is unknown.\n       ``What would migratory birds contribute to the \n     possibilities of disease outbreak? That is the question we \n     don't know the answer to,'' said David E. Swayne of the U.S. \n     Department of Agriculture's Southeast Poultry Research \n     Laboratory in Athens, Ga.\n       How the Qinghai Lake birds acquired H5N1 influenza is \n     unknown.\n       There are chickens in Qinghai Province, but ``there is no \n     H5N1 infection in those chickens--they don't have it,'' \n     George F. Gao of the Institute of Microbiology of the Chinese \n     Academy of Sciences said in a telephone interview from \n     Beijing. He is the lead author of the paper that was \n     published online by Science.\n       Both his team and one from the University of Hong Kong, \n     whose report is published online in Nature, detected in the \n     Qinghai Lake samples the three genetic defects and mutations \n     found in the H5N1 strains responsible for high mortality in \n     chickens and humans.\n       According to the two reports, the wild-bird strain bears \n     genetic features of the virus found in chickens in China in \n     2003 and 2005 and in a peregrine falcon in Hong Kong in 2004. \n     It is not identical to any of them, however.\n       The leader of the Hong Kong team, Yi Guan, a microbiologist \n     at the University of Hong Kong, said the Chinese Ministry of \n     Agriculture closed the Qinghai Lake area to his colleagues in \n     mid-May.\n       ``We hope they will open the door and let us in to do long-\n     term surveillance,'' he said yesterday from Hong Kong. \n     ``There are a lot of questions waiting for answers.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, July 17, 2005]\n\n                     Unprepared for a Flu Pandemic\n\n       If a much-feared pandemic of avian influenza starts \n     sweeping through the world's population anytime soon, neither \n     the United States nor international health authorities will \n     be prepared to cope with it. There is not enough vaccine or \n     antiviral medicine available to protect more than a handful \n     of people, and no industrial capacity to produce a lot more \n     of these medicines quickly.\n       The best that can be hoped is that no pandemic will \n     materialize for the next several years, allowing time to \n     become better prepared, or that a potential pandemic can be \n     spotted early enough to allow international health officials \n     to snuff it out before the virus runs amok.\n       It has been 37 years since the last influenza pandemic, or \n     widespread global epidemic, so by historic patterns we may be \n     due for another. And a particularly ominous strain of avian \n     influenza that has devastated poultry flocks in Asia seems \n     poised to wreak havoc in humans. This strain, known as H5N1, \n     first became a matter of health concern in 1997 when it was \n     found to have jumped from birds to humans in Hong Kong in an \n     outbreak that failed to spread widely. Since then, the virus \n     has looked more and more threatening. It has infected \n     poultry, domestic ducks and migratory birds in nine \n     countries, making the virus almost impossible to contain. \n     More ominously, the virus has developed the ability to jump \n     to a range of mammals, including pigs, mice, tigers and \n     domestic cats.\n       The human toll has been slight. Only 108 people have been \n     infected, of whom 54 have died, an alarmingly high mortality \n     rate but one that seems to be diminishing. It is reassuring \n     that millions of people have lived and worked in close \n     proximity to infected birds without harm and even more \n     reassuring that the flu strain has not yet developed the \n     ability to spread easily from one person to another, the sine \n     qua non for a pandemic to take off. But that could change in \n     a trice if the virus mutates or combines its genes with a \n     human influenza virus.\n       No one knows whether the world is headed toward a health \n     disaster or a false alarm, but virtually all experts agree we \n     need to strengthen our defenses. American health authorities \n     have taken the lead in testing vaccines against two strains \n     of avian flu and have contracted to buy two million doses of \n     a vaccine against H5N1. That is a tiny fraction of the amount \n     that would be needed if a pandemic hit, but will give the \n     manufacturer experience that would prove useful in a crisis. \n     Officials have also stockpiled enough antiviral medicine to \n     treat 2.3 million people, again a fraction of what would be \n     needed in a pandemic.\n       Yet the best defense might be to go on the offensive. The \n     most urgent need is to control the disease in poultry and \n     other animals that might spread the virus to humans. Some \n     countries have done a good job. Others, including Vietnam, \n     which accounts for almost 80 percent of the human cases, need \n     more prodding and international assistance. If the virus \n     breaks through this line of attack, authorities should try to \n     quench an incipient outbreak before it can really get \n     started. The Bush administration is wisely pumping millions \n     of dollars into an international effort to improve \n     surveillance of the disease in humans and animals in the \n     infected regions of Asia, and the World Health Organization \n     has amassed a small stockpile of antiviral drugs that will \n     soon be enlarged and could be rushed to the scene of any \n     outbreak.\n       Many experts are doubtful that it would be possible to \n     detect and contain an outbreak of transmissible influenza in \n     time to head off a pandemic. But that may be the best hope we \n     have until we are able to upgrade today's fragile and \n     unreliable vaccine production system with new processes that \n     can expand output quickly to meet a crisis.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, June 18, 2005]\n\n                     Bird Flu Drug Rendered Useless\n\n\n           Chinese Chickens Given Medication Made for Humans\n\n                           (By Alan Sipress)\n\n       Hong Kong.--Chinese farmers, acting with the approval and \n     encouragement of government officials, have tried to suppress \n     major bird flu outbreaks among chickens with an antiviral \n     drug meant for humans, animal\n\n[[Page S8449]]\n\n     health experts said. International researchers now conclude \n     that this is why the drug will no longer protect people in \n     case of a worldwide bird flu epidemic.\n       China's use of the drug amantadine, which violated \n     international livestock guidelines, was widespread years \n     before China acknowledged any infection of its poultry, \n     according to pharmaceutical company executives and \n     veterinarians.\n       Since January 2004, avian influenza has spread across nine \n     East Asian countries, devastating poultry flocks and killing \n     at least 54 people in Cambodia, Thailand and Vietnam, but \n     none in China. World Health Organization officials warned the \n     virus could easily undergo genetic changes to create a strain \n     capable of killing tens of millions of people worldwide.\n       Although China did not report an avian influenza outbreak \n     until February 2004, executives at Chinese pharmaceutical \n     companies and veterinarians said farmers were widely using \n     the drug to control the virus in the late 1990s.\n       The Chinese Agriculture Ministry approved the production \n     and sale of the drug for use in chickens, according to \n     officials from the Chinese pharmaceutical industry and the \n     government, although such use is barred in the United States \n     and many other countries. Local government veterinary \n     stations instructed Chinese farmers on how to use the drug \n     and at times supplied it, animal health experts said.\n       Amantadine is one of two types of medication for treating \n     human influenza. But researchers determined last year that \n     the H5N1 bird flu strain circulating in Vietnam and Thailand, \n     the two countries hardest hit by the virus, had become \n     resistant, leaving only an alternative drug that is difficult \n     to produce in large amounts and much less affordable, \n     especially for developing countries in Southeast Asia.\n       ``It's definitely an issue if there's a pandemic. \n     Amantadine is off the table,'' said Richard Webby, an \n     influenza expert at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in \n     Memphis.\n       Health experts outside China previously said they suspected \n     the virus's resistance to the medicine was linked to drug use \n     at poultry farms but were unable to confirm the practice \n     inside the country. Influenza researchers at the U.S. Centers \n     for Disease Control and Prevention, in particular, have \n     collected information about amantadine use from Chinese Web \n     sites but have been frustrated in their efforts to learn more \n     on the ground.\n       China has previously run afoul of international agencies \n     for its response to public and agricultural health crises, \n     notably the SARS epidemic that began in 2002. China's health \n     minister was fired after the government acknowledged it had \n     covered up the extent of the SARS outbreak by preventing \n     state-run media from reporting about the disease for months \n     and by minimizing its seriousness.\n       In interviews, executives at Chinese pharmaceutical \n     companies confirmed that the drug had been used since the \n     late 1990s, to treat chickens sickened by bird flu and to \n     prevent healthy ones from catching it.\n       ``Amantadine is widely used in the entire country,'' said \n     Zhang Libin, head of the veterinary medicine division of \n     Northeast General Pharmaceutical Factory in Shenyang. He \n     added, ``Many pharmaceutical factories around China produce \n     amantadine, and farmers can buy it easily in veterinary \n     medicine stores.''\n       Zhang and other animal health experts said the drug was \n     used by small, private farms and larger commercial ones. \n     Amantadine sells for about $10 a pound, a fraction of the \n     drug's cost in Europe and the United States, where its price \n     would be prohibitive for all but human consumption.\n       Two months before China first reported a bird flu outbreak \n     in poultry to the World Animal Health Organization in \n     February 2004, officials had begun a massive campaign to \n     immunize poultry against the virus. They have now used at \n     least 2.6 billion doses of a vaccine.\n       But researchers in Hong Kong have reported that the H5N1 \n     flu virus has been circulating in mainland China for at least \n     eight years and that Chinese farms suffered major outbreaks \n     in 1997, 2001 and 2003. Scientists have traced the virus that \n     has devastated farms across Southeast Asia in the last two \n     years to a strain isolated from a goose in China's Guangdong \n     province in 1996.\n       The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization has long \n     recommended that countries try to eradicate infectious animal \n     diseases by slaughtering infected flocks and increasing \n     safety measures on farms. Last year, the FAO also suggested \n     that countries consider vaccinating their poultry against \n     bird flu. But the guidelines never recommended the use of \n     antiviral drugs such as amantadine, which, unlike \n     vaccination, has been proven to make viruses resistant, \n     officials said.\n       In 1987, researchers at a U.S. Department of Agriculture \n     laboratory demonstrated that bird flu viruses developed drug \n     resistance within a matter of days when infected chickens \n     received amantadine.\n       Still, a veterinarian with personal knowledge of livestock \n     practices across China said Chinese farmers responded to the \n     bird flu outbreak by putting the drug into their chickens' \n     drinking water. The veterinarian asked that his name not be \n     published because he feared for his livelihood.\n       ``This would explain why we're seeing such high resistance \n     levels,'' said Michael T. Osterholm, director of the Center \n     for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University \n     of Minnesota. While various antibiotics have lost their \n     effectiveness because of overuse, he said, the emergence of \n     resistance to amantadine is unprecedented because it is an \n     antiviral.\n       ``This is the first example of an antiviral drug that was \n     used for animal production that has major implications for \n     human health,'' Osterholm said.\n       A popular Chinese handbook, titled Medicine Pamphlet for \n     Animals and Poultry, provides farmers and livestock officials \n     with specific prescriptions for amantadine use to treat \n     chickens and ferrets with respiratory viruses. The manual, \n     written by a professor at the People's Liberation Army \n     Agriculture and Husbandry University and issued by a \n     military-owned publishing company, prescribes 0.025 grams of \n     amantadine for each kilogram of chicken body weight.\n       Farmers also use the drug to prevent healthy chickens from \n     catching bird flu, giving it to their poultry about once a \n     month or more often when the weather is liable to change and \n     chickens are considered susceptible to illness, veterinary \n     experts said. The antiviral is often mixed with Chinese \n     herbs, vitamins and other medicine.\n       In the United States, amantadine was approved in 1976 by \n     the Food and Drug Administration for treating influenza in \n     adults. Amantadine and it sister drug, rimantadine, known \n     collectively as amantadines, work by preventing a flu virus \n     from reproducing itself. Both are now ineffective against the \n     H5N1 strain.\n       International health experts stressed that amantadine could \n     have been vital in stanching the spread of the bird flu virus \n     in the early weeks of an epidemic.\n       Now, the only alternative is oseltamivir and closely \n     related zanamivir, which stop the flu virus from leaving \n     infected cells and attacking new ones. Oseltamivir is easier \n     to use and has far greater sales.\n       ``Amantadine is the cheapest drug against flu,'' said Malik \n     Peiris, an influenza expert at the University of Hong Kong. \n     ``It is much more affordable for many countries of the \n     region. Now, it is clearly no longer an option.''\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1264\n\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I also want to make a brief statement on \namendment No. 1264, which is offered on behalf of Senator Hagel, \nSenator Gregg, Senator Leahy, and myself.\n  It is a very simple amendment. It provides $13 million for the \nSpecial Court for Sierra Leone to help make up for a shortfall in \ninternational contributions to the Court.\n  While the amendment is simple, it is critically important to \npromoting the rule of law in Africa; helping advance security and \nstability in West Africa; and holding accountable some of the worst war \ncriminals of the 20th century.\n  The Special Court was established by the United Nations Security \nCouncil with strong U.S. backing. The Court is working, as we speak, to \nbring to justice those most responsible for the atrocities committed in \nSierra Leone during wars there in the 1990s.\n  The Court, however, currently has one major piece of unfinished \nbusiness--Charles Taylor.\n  Although Mr. Taylor has been indicted by the Special Court on 17 \ncounts of war crimes and crimes against humanity, he continues to live \nin exile in Nigeria, enjoying the protection of the Nigerian \ngovernment.\n  What is worse is there are credible reports that Mr. Taylor has \nrepeatedly broken the terms of his agreement with the Nigerian \ngovernment, continues to meddle in the affairs of Liberia and other \nWest African nations, is involved in a number of activities that \nthreaten to destabilize the region, and has associations with al-Qaida.\n  There is no question that the United States and the international \ncommunity owe the Nigerian government a debt of gratitude for helping \nto remove Mr. Taylor from power. However, the job of promoting regional \npeace and security cannot be completed until Mr. Taylor appears before \nthe Special Court to answer to the charges against him.\n  I would also point out that transferring Charles Taylor to the Court \nalso is widely supported within Nigeria. Prominent members of Nigeria's \nmilitary and civil society have vigorously opposed the decision to \nshield Taylor.\n  This bipartisan amendment makes clear that bringing Mr. Taylor to \njustice is a top U.S. foreign policy priority. It makes clear that the \nCourt is not going away anytime in the near future. It makes clear that \nthe transfer of Mr. Taylor to the Court will help reduce transnational \nthreats in West Africa, promote peace and security in the region, and \nenhance respect for the rule of law throughout Africa.\n\n[[Page S8450]]\n\n  I understand that the managers are in the process of working this \namendment out, and I look forward to working with them to get this \naccepted. I would like to thank the cosponsors who played a leadership \nrole Senators Hagel, Gregg, and Leahy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 The President's Supreme Court Nominee\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, just a few moments ago, we all learned, \nthrough the miracle of modern technology, that the President intends to \nannounce his Supreme Court nominee tonight at 9 p.m. when he addresses \nthe Nation.\n  This is certainly the culmination of an unprecedented consultative \nprocess that this President has undertaken with the Senate, spending \nmore than 2 weeks now, I believe, reaching out to Senators on both \nsides of the aisle, asking for their suggestions.\n  Now, the President believes that it is appropriate for him to name \nthe successor to Justice Sandra Day O'Connor on the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  It is my hope that tonight's announcement will be met with some \nrestraint on the part of the Members of the Senate, that we will hold \nour fire, and that we will not prejudge this nominee or seek to use \nthis as an opportunity to perhaps disparage the nominee before we have \nhad a chance to ask questions, before the nominee has had a chance to \nmeet with Members, and before we have had a chance to conduct a hearing \nbefore the Senate Judiciary Committee, as we will surely do either in \nlate August or early September.\n  We can do better in the Senate than we have done in the recent past \nwhen it comes to judicial nominations. I think we have shown that we \ncan conduct ourselves with dignity and civility, even as we have \ndisagreed. Indeed, that is one of the great things about this body--\nthat even people who disagree can debate, but then turn that debate \nover to our colleagues for an up-or-down vote and the judgment of the \nAmerican people.\n  I hope we have a dignified process and one that reflects well on the \nSenate, that treats this nominee fairly, and allows the President to \nhave his nominee considered in the regular course of our business.\n  Throughout this debate, even before the President has named a \nnominee, various Senators have come to the floor and opined about how \nthis process should go forward. I will respond to some of the comments \nmade earlier today by the senior Senator from Massachusetts regarding \nthe process.\n  The senior Senator from Massachusetts envisions a step in this \nprocess where the President gives him and his colleagues the ability to \nveto particular nominees--in other words, suggesting that the President \nought to perhaps share some on his short list with the Senate before \nthe President can name a particular nominee. Nothing in the \nConstitution provides for or requires such a step. The President is \nunder no obligation to give any Senator the power to veto his \nnomination.\n  The Constitution entrusts the President with the power to nominate, \nand there is no requirement for the President to do anything further. \nIndeed, as I mentioned a moment ago, this President has gone above and \nbeyond the call and consulted in an unprecedented manner. But certainly \nthe Constitution doesn't give this President, or impose upon this \nPresident, the obligation to allow Senators to co-nominate their \nparticular choice along with the President. Rather, it provides for \nseparate and distinct functions for the President to nominate and then \nfor the Senate to conduct hearings, to act in its role of advice and \nconsent, and then to vote on the nominee.\n  The senior Senator from Massachusetts has said he wants the President \nto nominate someone who is independent and impartial. I submit that the \nbest way to do that is to do precisely the opposite of what the senior \nSenator from Massachusetts says he intends to do; that is, he says he \nintends to demand that the nominee answer questions about how he or she \nwill rule on particular questions or particular issues.\n  The Senator has stated his intention to ask nominees how they would \nrule on a host of different issues. Today, he mentioned several of \nthem--everything from retirement benefits to college admission \nstandards. He even noted that all of these issues are likely to be \nsubjects of future Court decisions. It would, however, undermine the \nindependence of the nominee and the judiciary to demand that he or she \nanswer questions about issues that are likely to come before the Court.\n  How can a nominee be truly independent from the Congress if they are \nrequired to make a pledge to certain outcomes in the Senate in order to \nget confirmed? Well, simply stated, they cannot be independent and make \nsuch a pledge. So it would be inappropriate for any nominee to make \nthat pledge. While certainly I recognize and respect the right of any \nSenator to ask any question he or she wants, no nominee worthy of \nconfirmation would in fact answer those questions and make such a \npledge.\n  It would also undermine the impartiality of the person nominated to \ndemand that he or she answer questions on issues likely to come before \nthe Court. Imagine if you came before a judge and you find out that \nthat judge already, during the confirmation process, stated his or her \nbelief in the correctness of a certain outcome, before you have even \nhad a chance to present your case to the Court. Imagine if that judge \npromised the President or a Senator that he or she would rule against \nyou no matter what you said.\n  That is not equal and open-minded justice. That is not a judicial \nprocess but rather a political process, and one we ought to avoid at \nall costs.\n  It is also not how we have conducted our business in the recent past. \nJustice Ginsburg was confirmed by the Senate by a vote of 96 to 3. \nBefore her service on the Federal bench, Justice Ginsburg served as \ngeneral counsel of the American Civil Liberties Union, a liberal \norganization that has championed the abolition of traditional marriage \nlaws and challenged the Pledge of Allegiance because the words ``under \nGod'' are invoked in that pledge.\n  Before she became a judge, now-Justice Ginsburg expressed opposition \nto laws prohibiting bigamy and prostitution. She wrote that the Boy \nScouts and Girl Scouts were discriminatory institutions, and that \ntaxpayer funds should be used to pay for abortions--hardly views that \nthe American people would view as mainstream. Yet the Senate did not \nengage in asking her to make prejudgments about cases she later would \nrule on from the Supreme Court. They did not ask her to make promises \nto politicians about how she would perform once confirmed. Indeed, \nRepublicans and Democrats alike set aside such concerns and approved \nher nomination.\n  Make no mistake, I am just as curious as anybody else about what the \nprivate views of a nominee might be. But the need to assure a fair \nprocess and an independent judiciary and to avoid the hyper-\npoliticalization of this process more than outweighs a results-oriented \ncuriosity on my part or on the part of any other Senator, I submit.\n  Finally, the Senator from Massachusetts said he also wants the \nPresident to nominate a consensus choice to the Supreme Court. But it \nwill be up to the Senator and his other colleagues whether the nominee \nmeets their definition of what actually constitutes a consensus choice. \nThe President has said he intends to nominate someone in the mold of \nJustice Scalia. Justice Scalia was confirmed by a vote of 98 to 0. That \nis quite a consensus.\n  So long we do not change the standard from when the nomination of \nJustice Scalia was considered or Justice Ginsburg was considered, then \nwe will have a relatively easy time confirming the President's \nselection if they meet the basic qualifications of legal scholarship, \nhigh ethical rectitude; in short, the type of person we would entrust \nwith making the weighty decisions that are made by the Supreme Court.\n  But if we, to the contrary, revert to a political process, one that \nis accusatory of this nominee before we actually have a chance to \ninvestigate their background and fitness for this office, if we engage \nin asking nominees to make promises to politicians about how they will \nrule in the future, I\n\n[[Page S8451]]\n\nthink we will not have conducted ourselves in the best traditions of \nthe Senate, and certainly not in a way that befits the awesome \nresponsibility imposed upon the Senate under the Constitution of the \nUnited States.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I have come to the floor to speak about \nan amendment to the pending matter, the Foreign Operations \nappropriations bill. But the focal statements of my friend from Texas \nlead me to say a word about the apparently imminent nomination by the \nPresident of a Justice to the Supreme Court to replace Justice \nO'Connor.\n  I want to particularly identify myself with Senator Cornyn's call \nthat to the extent possible, we dispatch our very important \nresponsibilities to advise and consent to the President's nomination to \nthe Court in a nonpolitical manner.\n  I have been in politics all my adult life, so I am not naive. I know \nwhen you have a political environment such as today, which is intensely \npartisan, when you have a Supreme Court, such as we have today, which \nis quite closely divided on some of the major issues facing our \ncountry, that it is going to be hard for this to be a totally \nnonpolitical process. But I do think, to the extent possible, that is \nwhat the Framers of our Constitution, the Founders of our country \nwanted us to do, and that is what our responsibility as Senators in \nthis Chamber calls on us to do.\n  The fact is, in the magnificent framework that the Founders created \nfor the American Government, which has stood this great democracy, this \ngreat Republic so well for now more than two centuries, the Supreme \nCourt was intended to occupy a unique place. It is the least political \nof the branches of Government. It is the branch of Government that is \nnot occupied by elected officials. Supreme Court Justices, appointed by \nthe President, serve life terms, going well beyond, in most cases, the \nterm of the President who appointed them.\n\n  The Supreme Court, in the contemplation of the Founders of this \ncountry, was meant to be that branch of Government that is most \nseparated from the political passions of the moment that might lead the \nlegislative or executive branch to take a particular action. The \nSupreme Court is there to apply, if you will allow me to say so, the \neternal values incorporated in our Constitution and the Bill of Rights \nto the matters of the moment that come before them. They are human, so \nthey obviously are sensitive to what is happening around them.\n  The high calling of the Court is to look beyond the moment, including \nthe political controversies of the moment, and do what they think the \nConstitution requires them to do and what the future of this \nconstitutional Republic of ours requires them to do.\n  This is a big moment which, to the best of our ability, we should try \nto keep as nonpolitical as possible, nonpartisan as possible, to focus \non the nominee in a thoughtful way.\n  I agree, it would be an unusual circumstance if people started to \njump to conclusions immediately as to whether they were for or against \nthe person the President will apparently announce tonight. It is going \nto require some consideration of the person's record, some thoughtful \nconsideration. The Judiciary Committee will hold hearings. There will \nbe public questioning. So we are going to have ample time to find out \nmore about the nominee.\n  There may be partisans on both sides, Democrats and Republicans, both \nideological sides--left and right--who will want to immediately and, in \nsome sense already have, make this nomination a matter of controversy, \nconfrontation, division. That is their right in our democracy. But \nultimately this comes down to 101 people: the President of the United \nStates who, in the first instance, the most significant by virtue of \nhaving been elected, has earned the right to make this nomination, and \nthen the other 100, of course, are the Members of this Senate. For the \nPresident and for the 100 of us privileged to serve in the Senate \ntoday, this is one of the big moments in our service because Supreme \nCourt Justices have so much to say over the course of a generation or \ntwo about the quality of American freedom, about the quality of our \nGovernment, about the balance of rights, about the adjudication of \ncontroversies in our country. We are all going to be tested.\n  I look forward to a nominee being named tonight who, I hope, will \nfill the President's pledge that he will nominate somebody who is \nmainstream, but he will not apply litmus tests. I thank the White \nHouse, including the President, for the consultation that has gone on \nwith Members of the Senate of both parties leading up to this \nnomination tonight. Most of all, I hope we in this Chamber, because \nthis is our responsibility, will conduct ourselves in a way that will \nbe thoughtful; that not only will lead to an appropriate result in \nregard to the confirmation or failure to do so of the nominee, but will \nalso bring some honor to this Chamber, and at a moment, as I said a \nmoment ago, when there is too much polarization in our politics, that \nwe will together do what is right for our country, at home and abroad.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1248\n\n  Mr. President, I came to the floor today to thank the floor managers, \nSenators McConnell and Leahy, for their stewardship of this very \nimportant bill, the Foreign Operations appropriations bill. I also \nspecifically came to thank them for accepting an amendment on refugees \nthat I offered to this bill with Senators Brownback and Kennedy, a \nbipartisan measure.\n  Senators McConnell and Leahy have a longstanding commitment to the \nwell-being of refugees, and this priority is reflected in the \nlegislation they have reported out of the committee which devotes $900 \nmillion to refugee assistance. This is a worthy expenditure of \nAmerica's money. That figure is more than the administration had \nrequested. And I hope that in future years, the many supporters of \nrefugees in both the Senate and the House--on both sides of the aisle--\ncan work together to increase our support for refugee assistance.\n  This Nation of ours has been the home to so many who have come here \nseeking freedom and a better life. It is the essence of what America is \nabout, and that includes addressing the systemic problems that have \nkept so many refugees in exile, confined in camps without a real home.\n  Senator Kennedy and Senator Brownback have been leaders in calling \nattention to the longstanding plight of refugees in the world. Earlier \nthis year, I was privileged to cosponsor a resolution they submitted \ncondemning the so-called warehousing of refugees.\n  The amendment we offered, which was accepted yesterday by the floor \nmanagers, builds on that antiwarehousing resolution by directing the \nexpenditure of funds on programs that can help move refugees out of \nthese camps and ease their assimilation into normal communities. The \namendment addresses the heartrending conditions of millions of refugees \nwho have been confined in these camps for many years.\n  Here is a number that may stun people who are listening. Worldwide, \nthere are 8 million refugees who have been confined to camps or other \nrestricted settlements for longer than 5 years. That is a number that \nrepresents more than half of all refugees in the world--8 million in \ncamps for at least 5 years.\n  In many cases, the refugees have been confined in camps for decades. \nThese warehouse refugees include people who have fled oppressive \nregimes, civil wars, even genocide. Their confinement deprives them, in \nmy opinion, of the guaranteed right of the U.N. Refugee Convention of \n1951, such as the right to work, to travel, to own property, and to \nreceive a basic education. Generations of refugees are born and die in \ncamps. They cannot support their families. Their living conditions too \noften are horrendous. Their inherent potential as human beings, as \nrecognized by our own Declaration of Independence, is suppressed and \nsquandered.\n  Unfortunately, the neighboring countries that have absorbed a sudden \ninflow of refugees are often the least equipped to care for them. So it \nis with the Burmese, the subject of the resolution adopted today, \nsanctioning the Burmese Government for antidemocratic policies. So it \nis with the Burmese who have fled to Thailand during this circumstance, \nto Bangladesh and India, the Angolans in Zambia, the\n\n[[Page S8452]]\n\nBhutanese in Nepal, and the Somalians and Sudanese in Kenya.\n  In response to immediate humanitarian needs, refugees are frequently \nmassed in camps where nongovernmental organizations and the United \nNations Commissioner for Refugees can more easily get aid to them. That \nis an understandable short-term reaction.\n  Too often the camps have become long-term realities. We cannot expect \ndeveloping countries such as Africa, Asia and Latin America to shoulder \nalone the burden of assimilating refugees, but neither can we accept a \nstatus quo that allows millions to remain massed at border camps \nindefinitely. Instead, we must work with countries that host refugee \ncommunities to develop alternatives to confinement in camps, and that \nis what the language of this amendment that Senators Kennedy, \nBrownback, and I have introduced will do.\n  Our amendment directs the Secretary of State to work with the UNHR, \nwith nongovernmental organizations, and with host countries to develop \nprograms that support refugees outside of camps, programs that \nfacilitate the integration of refugees by promoting their access to \nschools, health care, and other local services in the communities in \nwhich the camps are located.\n  The international donor community will need to be responsive to local \nneeds and, of course, local sensitivities. We have to create incentives \nfor the host communities so they can see the local assimilation of \nrefugees as an opportunity, not a threat. For example, refugees with \nspecial skills can help create economic opportunities for others around \nthem. Our aid can pay for doctors, teachers, and facilities that are \nshared by the refugees and the local communities, thus benefiting the \nlocal community as well, or for job training and job creation programs \nthat also would benefit the people in the surrounding communities. Our \namendment calls on the State Department to fund programs that encourage \ndialog among local communities, the United Nations, and nongovernmental \norganizations.\n  There is no easy solution to this refugee crisis that exists around \nthe world, but it does cry out to us as the strongest and, in my \nopinion, greatest and most humanitarian nation in the world to do \nsomething to assist these people, these fellow citizens of this Earth.\n  In some instances, conditions will improve sufficiently so that \nrefugees can return to their home countries. Many nations offer to \nresettle refugees, but relatively few of the world's refugees actually \nget that opportunity. Permanent integration into the country of first \nasylum is also rare, and that leaves a temporary solution that is \nneither temporary nor a solution, which is confinement in camps.\n  Many in Congress and others around the world are speaking out against \nthe warehousing of refugees. They are looking for a better way. Helping \nto improve the lives of refugees will take work, it will take money, \nand it will take perseverance, but that is what this country is all \nabout. It is worth it when we consider the living conditions of the \nSudanese, Burmese, and other refugee children. Let us think about the \nchildren who are born in these camps and will die in these camps unless \nwe do something to help them. Without our help, they will never have a \nfuture beyond the confinement of these camps.\n  When we think about what this $900 million can do to open up the \npossibility of a future to these children, we know it is worth it. That \nis why I am honored to have worked with Senators Kennedy and Brownback \non this amendment, and again I am very grateful to Senators McConnell \nand Leahy for accepting it. It was amendment No. 1248.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman).

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To prevent funds from being made available to provide \n    assistance to a country which has refused to extradite certain \n                   individuals to the United States)\n\n       On page 326, between lines 10 and 11, insert the following:\n\n\n      GOVERNMENTS THAT HAVE FAILED TO PERMIT CERTAIN EXTRADITIONS\n\n       Sec. 6113. None of the funds made available in this Act for \n     the Department of State, other than funds made available in \n     title III under the heading ``international narcotics control \n     and law enforcement'', may be used to provide assistance to \n     any country whose government has notified the Department of \n     State of its refusal to extradite to the United States an \n     individual, or has not within a reasonable period of time \n     responded to a request for extradition to the United States \n     of an individual, charged with committing a criminal offense \n     in the United States for which the maximum penalty is life \n     imprisonment without the possibility of parole, or a lesser \n     term of imprisonment, regardless of the individual's \n     citizenship status.\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I offer an amendment to the \nappropriations bill for State and Foreign Operations in regard to an \nissue that is very troubling to me. When an individual is charged with \na crime and flees to a foreign country, it is the responsibility of the \nU.S. Department of State to seek extradition of that fugitive.\n  In some instances, countries will refuse extradition. A common reason \nis where the prosecutors in the United States intend to seek the death \npenalty. Oftentimes, the prosecutors will waive the death penalty in \norder for the extradition to proceed successfully. I suppose this is an \nunderstandable bargain because not all countries around the world \naccept capital punishment.\n  I am greatly concerned, however, about other instances where \nextradition is denied. For example, let me explain what happened to the \nson of a man named David Fulton, who is a constituent of mine from \nHampton, GA.\n  On December 21, 2002, Mr. Fulton's son, CPL Joshia Fulton of the U.S. \nMarine Corps, was murdered right here on the streets of Washington, DC. \nAt the time of his murder, Corporal Fulton was a member of the elite \nPresidential protection program called Yankee White, an assignment \nthrough which he had the honor of traveling abroad with the President \nof the United States. Corporal Fulton was awaiting assignment for \nservice as a guard in the West Wing of the White House when he was \nkilled.\n  After an investigation by the District of Columbia police department, \na criminal complaint was filed charging a suspect named Carlos Almanza \nwith the murder of Joshia Fulton. Almanza, however, fled the United \nStates to his home country, the Republic of Nicaragua, where that \ncountry's constitution prohibits extradition of its citizens.\n  If Nicaragua refuses to turn this murder suspect over to the U.S. \nauthorities so he can be brought to justice in the United States, where \nthis heinous crime occurred, then Nicaragua should not receive any \nfinancial aid from the United States under the appropriations bill now \nbefore the Senate. Nicaragua's constitutional ban on extradition of its \ncitizens who are fugitives from justice is simply no excuse. That law \nneeds to change if they want to continue to receive American aid.\n  Mr. President, let me point out another situation in which \nextradition of criminal suspects has been frustrated in recent times; \nthat is, where countries will not extradite fugitives not because they \nface the death penalty but because they face life in prison without \nparole.\n  For example, in October 2001, the Mexican Supreme Court ruled that \nextradition of a person from Mexico who faces life imprisonment in the \nUnited States would violate the Mexican Constitution's bar on cruel and \nunusual punishment. This decision has resulted in a serious setback to \nthe United States-Mexico so-called bilateral relationship.\n  Since that court decision, the Mexican Government has asked the \nUnited States for assurances that life imprisonment would not be \nimposed on persons extradited to this country. In the absence of such \nassurance, they refused to extradite.\n  The impact of the Mexican Supreme Court decision has been ``severe,'' \nas described by the Department of Justice. Not only have extradition \nrequests been denied by the courts, but many prosecutors hesitate to \nseek extradition due to the requirement of lessening a sentence.\n  Costa Rica, Spain, Venezuela, and Portugal have also sought non-\nimposition of life sentences. Some of these countries have even set \nterm limits for the maximum number of years a criminal faces before \nthey will extradite. In Costa Rica, it is 50 years; in Venezuela, it is \n30 years; in Portugal, it is 20 years.\n  My amendment reads simply as follows:\n\n       None of the funds made available in this Act for the \n     Department of State, other than funds made available in title \n     III under the heading ``International Narcotics Control and \n     Law Enforcement,'' may be used to provide assistance to any \n     country whose government has notified the Department of State \n     of its refusal to extradite to the United States an \n     individual, or has not within a reasonable period of time \n     responded to a request for extradition to the United States \n     of an individual, charged with committing a criminal offense \n     in the United States for which the maximum penalty is life \n     imprisonment without the possibility of parole, or a lesser \n     term of imprisonment, regardless of his or her citizenship \n     status.\n\n  My intent in offering this amendment is not to deny aid to any \ncountry but, rather, to provide a substantial incentive for \nrecalcitrant countries to reform their extradition laws so that \nsuspected criminals can be brought to justice in the United States, \nwhich I submit to you offers the greatest due process protections to \nthose who stand accused of a crime of any country in the world.\n  Mr. President, I applaud the House of Representatives for recently \npassing similar amendments to the State-Foreign Operations \nappropriations bill that will deny U.S. aid to countries that refuse to \nextradite fugitive criminal suspects to the United States. My \ncolleague, Congressman Nathan Deal of Georgia, offered such an \namendment in the House, and it passed by a vote of 294 to 132. \nLikewise, Congressman Bob Beauprez of Colorado offered an amendment \nthat would withhold funds to any country that refuses to extradite a \nfugitive cop-killer suspect. His amendment passed on a vote of 327 to \n98.\n  The thought behind my amendment, as well as those passed by our \ncolleagues in the House, is that financial assistance from the United \nStates is a privilege--a privilege that can and should be revoked where \na recipient country refuses to extend to the United\n\n[[Page S8455]]\n\nStates the simple courtesy of sending back those who have been charged \nwith breaking our laws. These fugitives should not be allowed to seek \nrefuge under the laws of countries who would purport to be our friends.\n  Friendship should be reciprocal and, consequently, privileges like \nforeign aid can be revocable. The bottom line on my amendment is that \nwe should not spend the tax dollars of hard-working Americans to assist \ncountries that don't want to treat us with the respect that a \nfriendship deserves.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I want to make a report to Republican \nMembers of the Senate. We are down to a handful of amendments. I am \naware of only one at the moment that may require a rollcall vote. So \nlet me announce to our Republican colleagues that time is running out \nfor them to come over and let me know for sure whether they need to \noffer an amendment so we can find out whether it can be worked out.\n  As I indicated, at this moment, there is only one Republican \namendment we know that will require a rollcall vote, and we have a \ntight time agreement on it that the author is willing to enter into.\n  I know my friend and colleague Senator Leahy has worked hard to \nreduce the possible number of amendments on the Democratic side. I will \nyield the floor and hope we get a report to him on how we stand and see \nif he is making the same progress.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Kentucky for \ntrying to move this bill along. I have been trying to do the same on my \nside. I am hoping we can.\n  In fairness, if people actually have amendments, they should bring \nthem forward. We have had several hours of quorum calls today. It would \nnot seem to make a great deal of sense that we be here at midnight \ntonight finishing the bill. I join with the Senator from Kentucky. We \ncould easily have had it finished by now. I will make one last call on \nour Members, but I am very eager to go to third reading.\n  I see other Senators seeking recognition. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me add, we are going to finish the \nbill tonight. We hope to finish it late this afternoon. We have made \ngood progress on this side of the aisle in whittling down the number of \namendments. We would like to talk to anyone remaining on the Republican \nside who has an amendment they may want to offer, and Senator Leahy, of \ncourse, is open for business on the Democratic side.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I will make a few comments before I call \nup a couple of amendments.\n  No. 1, I am disheartened that the committee, as well as the \nadministration, would not take our restrictions on the USAID program \nfor malaria. The Federal Financial Management Subcommittee of the \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee had a very \ninsightful and revealing hearing that revealed in testimony that the \nvast majority of the funds to help those in Africa suffering from \nmalaria, both in terms of prevention and treatment, were not going for \nthat purpose, but yet were being consumed by consultations and travel, \nand very little of the $90 million that is allocated each year actually \nis going to treat malaria.\n  One million African children under 5 years of age each year die from \na totally preventable disease, malaria. It takes 90 cents to treat them \nand cure them of that disease.\n  I am markedly disappointed in the process that even though the \nadministration has a great new program for malaria in Africa, \nlimitations on the present program would not be agreed to and put in \nplace. I assure this body and the administration that within 3 months, \nwe are going to look at the USAID program for malaria again and if, in \nfact, they are still wasting money the way they are today and not \nachieving the goals of prevention and treatment for malaria, then we \nwill be bringing another piece of legislation to the floor to modify \nthe expenditures and put a limitation on them.\n  I also am somewhat disheartened that the State Department failed to \nrecognize the contribution of 47 individuals in Iraq and that, through \ntheir own inappropriateness and lack of ability to follow the law, \noverpaid these individuals. Their average work time was 16 to 18 hours \na day, 7 days a week over the last year, and the State Department has \nnow made a very onerous and difficult situation for those people, who \nare still in Iraq, to now have to pay back money inadvertently \noverpaid. This is a small price to pay. The cost to collect the \noverpayments is going to be more than the forgiveness would have been. \nBut yet we have a stiff rule that we seem to be more interested in \ndoing what the State Department wants in terms of its technical \nproblems instead of doing what is probably the best thing to do for \nthese people who have sacrificed greatly in Iraq.\n  We are going to be debating a couple of amendments in a few moments. \nOne amendment will be an amendment under which Senator Boxer and I \nlimit some funds of the Export-Import Bank in terms of financing sales \nof nuclear powerplants to China. It is a fairly straightforward \namendment. There is no question we want to promote jobs in this \ncountry. It is important for us to stay competitive. But competing with \nthe French in terms of subsidizing a British corporation, not an \nAmerican corporation, and subsidizing that to the intent that it will, \nin fact, allow technology that Westinghouse Electric, which is owned by \nBritish Nuclear Fuels which is owned by the British Government, that \ntechnology 10 years from now will belong to the Chinese. We are in \nessence through an American taxpayers' loan, subsidizing the Chinese to \ntake more of our technology.\n  The press is rife, the reports are rife, our trade people also \nrecognize intellectual property is not something that is honored by the \nChinese Government. There are some very significant inconsistencies in \nour policy that I think we need to reinforce, and this amendment with \nSenator Boxer is intended to do that.\n  The other amendment I will be calling up has to do with the \nexpenditure of USAID in terms of entertainment. There is no question \nthat we have much to do in terms of our foreign policy internationally \nand that the USAID can and should be the agent of a lot of those \nchanges. However, there are significant problems associated with that, \nand we will be discussing that.\n  I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Amendments Nos. 1241 and 1242, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I call up amendments Nos. 1241 and 1242.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes amendment \n     No. 1241.\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn], for himself, and \n     Mrs. Boxer, proposes an amendment numbered 1242.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT No. 1241\n\n  (Purpose: To prohibit funds from being made available to the United \nStates Agency for International Development for entertainment expenses)\n\n       On page 206, strike lines 6 through 10, and insert the \n     following:\n\n\n                         LIMITATION ON EXPENSES\n\n       Sec. 6004. None of the funds appropriated or made available \n     pursuant to this Act may be used for entertainment expenses \n     of the United States Agency for International Development.\n\n[[Page S8456]]\n\n (Purpose: To prohibit any funds from being used by the Export-Import \nBank of the United States to approve a loan or a loan guarantee related \n                     to a nuclear project in China)\n\n       On page 326, between lines 10 and 11, insert the following:\n\n\n                EXPORT-IMPORT BANK OF THE UNITED STATES\n\n       Sec. 6113. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, \n     none of the funds appropriated or made available pursuant to \n     this Act may be used by the Export09Import Bank of the United \n     States to approve an application for a long-term loan or a \n     loan guarantee related to a nuclear project in the People's \n     Republic of China.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Amendment 1241 has to do with entertainment expenses \nassociated with USAID. I have a couple of charts that I will refer to. \nWe are going to run a true on-budget deficit this year of $541 billion. \nIt is inappropriate for bureaucracies of our Government to spend money \nin ways that are not appropriate when, in fact, that money can do much \ngreater things.\n  In the current bill, and since 1999, there has been a limitation of \n$5,000 in the USAID budget for entertainment. Much of this \nentertainment has gone for personal gifts, for live entertainment, for \ndinners. One of the things I found quite striking was what the USAID \nhandbook states about spending.\n  The USAID handbook states: For budget purposes, entertainment \nincludes food and drink, receptions, banquets, live or recorded music, \nlive artistic performances, personal gifts and furnishings.\n  The USAID handbook also states: The USAID has the authority to use \nprogram and regular operating expense funds for entertainment under the \nnecessary expense doctrine. GAO decisions to the contrary are not \nbinding on the executive branch. There are no restrictions on the use \nof the entertainment account or representation allowances for alcoholic \nbeverages.\n  Let us talk about what $5,000 per pop could do. Five thousand dollars \nper pop in Africa today is enough to prevent 1,250 babies from getting \nHIV. Are we going to have a party or buy gifts for officials of African \ngovernments, or are we going to cure babies of HIV and prevent the \ntransmission?\n  Five thousand dollars is enough to prevent 5,000 children from dying \nof malaria. Are we going to have a party with USAID, are we going to \nhave entertainment, or are we going to direct USAID back to their \ndirected purpose, which is carrying out the good will and the financial \nassets of Americans to make an impact on the health, lives, and \nprosperity of those we are attempting to serve?\n  Five thousand dollars would buy 5,000 5-gallon bottles of clean water \nfor the multitudes of cities that have no clean water. Are we going to \nspend it on entertainment--and we do not care what the GAO says, we do \nnot care what Congress says--are we going to spend it on entertainment \nand furnishings?\n  Five thousand dollars would buy 300 bags of rice, oats, and wheat for \ncommunities in need of food and nourishment. Are we going to have \nentertainment for USAID, or are we going to send the money?\n  The problem the American people have with our foreign aid is not that \nthey do not want to help people. They want to help. The problem is they \nhave become skeptical that their tax dollars are actually getting to \nthe very people they intend and want to help. USAID can limit this. \nThey can make a bigger difference if, in fact, they will eliminate the \nentertainment portions of their budgets.\n  Five thousand dollars can buy 10 additional body armor units for our \ntroops. Are we going to have entertainment by USAID, or are we going to \nhave additional body armor units for our troops?\n  I am not a prude. I think there is an appropriate time for us to \ngreet in a diplomatic fashion, in a way that is commensurate with what \nis protocol, but I do not think USAID has to be doing that. There are \nother areas within the State Department that should be doing that.\n  The last thing I would say is $5,000 may seem like an inconsequential \namount one at a time, but when it is done multiple times, it is not \ninconsequential, No. 1. No. 2, it could be the difference of life and \ndeath for the very people USAID proposes to want to help.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I will be sending an amendment to the \ndesk.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Would the Senator from New Jersey yield for just a \nmoment?\n  Mr. CORZINE. Certainly.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Would the Senator from New Jersey be willing to \nwithhold until I get a time agreement on one of the Coburn amendments, \nand then the Senator from New Jersey will be recognized again?\n  Mr. CORZINE. I would be happy to yield for that.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, it is my understanding after \ndiscussions with the Senator from Oklahoma, the ranking member of the \nsubcommittee and myself, we have an agreement on voting on the Coburn-\nBoxer amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that there be 60 minutes for debate in \nrelation to the Coburn-Boxer amendment No. 1242, with Senator Coburn in \ncontrol of 20 minutes, Senator Boxer in control of 20 minutes, and 20 \nminutes under my control; provided further that following the use or \nyielding back of time, the Senate proceed to a vote in relation to the \namendment, with no amendments in order to the amendment prior to the \nvote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object, and I shall not--I \ndiscussed this with the Senator from Kentucky before--I will make two \nadditions, one to add 5 minutes for the Senator from Vermont, which I \ndo not expect to be using but just because of the way it is broken \ndown, just to make sure that I have time; and secondly, this debate not \nstart until such time as the Senator from New Jersey, the Senator from \nWisconsin, and the Senator from New York who are on the floor, each \nwaiting to speak briefly, make their statements before we begin the \nCoburn-Boxer amendment. With those provisos, the additional 5 minutes \nfor myself, plus the time for the three of them, I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEAHY. They are asking, as I understand it, for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. CORZINE. If the Senator from Vermont would yield, I ask unanimous \nconsent for up to 10 minutes for myself, 5 minutes for Senator Kohl, \nand 5 minutes for Senator Schumer.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I make that as part of the agreement.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. After which we would move to the Coburn-Boxer \namendment?\n  Mr. LEAHY. That is right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Jersey is now recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1290\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendments are \nset aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Corzine], for himself, Mr. \n     DeWine, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Brownback, and Mr. Obama, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1290.\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To make funds available for the African Union Mission in \n                                 Sudan)\n\n       On page 326, between lines 10 and 11, insert the following:\n\n\n                           TRANSFER OF FUNDS\n\n       Sec. 6113. Of the funds appropriated in title III under the \n     heading ``conflict response fund'', $50,000,000 shall be \n     transferred to, and merged with, the funds appropriated in \n     title IV under the heading ``foreign military financing \n     program'' and made available to provide assistance to support \n     the African Union Mission in Sudan.\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise once again to speak out on the \nsubject that I have addressed on the floor a number of times and feel \npassionately about--a number of us do--and that is the continuing \ngenocide in Darfur.\n  I offer an amendment to the Foreign Operations bill to provide funds \nfor the African Union to provide the troops that will protect and stop \nthe genocide if we have the will to take the steps to have the \nresources made available.\n\n[[Page S8457]]\n\n  Hundreds of people are dying every day, some by guns, some by \nillness, disease, and a whole host of things. There have been over \n300,000 lives lost over the last 2 years and 2 million people \ndisplaced. One year ago this Friday, the Senate recognized this \ngenocide and spoke about it. Our Secretary of State testified in the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee to the fact that genocide was taking \nplace.\n  To the President's credit, before he left for the G8, he spoke out \nagain against the genocide that is taking place here and now. There is \ncomplete recognition that this is a tragedy that is unfolding, maybe \nmore in slow motion today than it was 6 months or a year ago, but it is \nvery much still taking place. People are losing their lives. Our \nPresident, the Congress, and the American people understand it is time \nto stop this genocide.\n  Last weekend, there was a national weekend of prayer and reflection \nfor Darfur based on a Senate resolution that Senator Brownback and I \nput forward. It was unanimously accepted by this body. Churches, \nsynagogues, mosques, and other communities of faith, people across this \ncountry with conscience and compassion spoke up together that they want \nthis genocide stopped.\n  In New Jersey, I attended services at the B'nai Jeshurun Congregation \nat the Barnert Temple in Franklin Lakes and the Shiloh Baptist Church \nand First United Methodist Church in Trenton. People of all \nbackgrounds, all religious faiths, people of conscience want us to act. \nThe people are demanding that we act.\n  We have looked at the history across the last century. We have seen \nthe Holocaust, the genocides in Rwanda, Cambodia, Armenia, and we \nconstantly are saying: Never again. Never again, we say, will we accept \nthe slaughter of our fellow human beings; never again will we stand by \nwhile systematic crimes are being inflicted on humanity. Now is the \ntime to put deed with words on ``never again.''\n  The amendment I am offering provides critical assistance to the \nAfrican Union and Darfur. My colleagues, Senators DeWine, Durbin, \nBrownback, and Obama, were seeking to provide the African Union with \n$50 million. Frankly, that is not enough. It does not meet what the \nState Department knows is necessary. It does not meet what is necessary \nto get the proper amount of troops on the ground in Darfur, Sudan. I am \ndisappointed that we cannot figure out how we can declare this \nemergency funding, whatever it takes, to make sure that we put deeds \nwith words on ``never again.''\n  The African Union has been deployed. Where it has been deployed, it \nhas been successful. The attacks have stopped. Keep in mind, Darfur is \nthe size of Texas. The current deployment of about 3,300 troops just \ndoes not get the job done. There has to be a sustained presence. \nCivilians are protected one day, they move on to the next spot, and \nthey are no longer.\n  The African Union has a plan to put 7,700 troops there by the end of \nSeptember. They need the funding. They do not have the resources. The \nreal need is 12,000. There is a plan to have that done by next May. We \nare working with the United Nations on that.\n  The United States has to step up and help. If we know that genocide \nis occurring, we have a moral obligation to help. It is tragic that we \nare not putting our money where our mouth is; we are not putting money \nfor the deeds that match the words that we so willingly put out.\n  Again, I compliment President Bush for speaking out on this and being \nattentive to it, as well as the State Department, but we need to make \nsure the resources match the stated policy. The Government of Khartoum \nis still not doing those things that are necessary. We ought to have a \nfull policy with regard to putting a special envoy on the ground. We \nneed to make sure that we are putting an arms embargo against the state \nof Sudan, all of Sudan. We need to make sure there is pressure about \nreal sanctions on those who have been responsible for those crimes and \nthat they are held accountable. All of this has been in legislation \nthat Senator Brownback and I have brought before this body and have had \npassed unanimously at other times.\n\n  The American people are watching us to see whether we have the will \nto address the moral challenge of genocide. They are watching to see \nwhether we can make the choices to do something about it. Last weekend, \nAmericans of faith and conscience spoke. I hope we will do that with \nregard to this amendment, but I hope we will go further and make sure \nwe have all of the resources that are necessary to fulfill this plan of \ngetting 7,700 troops on the ground by September and 12,000 by next \nspring.\n  This is a moral challenge to the people in this body. It is a moral \nchallenge to our country. I hope we accept it and work together to \naddress something that we all know is necessary.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 The President's Supreme Court Nominee\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, we have all just heard the President will \nannounce this evening a candidate to replace Supreme Court Justice \nSandra Day O'Connor. Then, the Senate will begin its constitutional \nduty to examine the nominee and give or withhold our consent. As the \nSenator from Connecticut said earlier on the floor, this is one of our \nmost important jobs. Whomever we put on the Supreme Court will affect \nthe lives of every American. Further, that person will receive a \nlifetime appointment, unchecked by elections or any other \naccountability to the people for whom we work. The confirmation process \nis our only chance to make sure whomever we put in this very powerful \njob embraces our values, respects our laws, and protects our \nConstitution.\n  We need to make sure this nominee is well-qualified and approaches \nlegal issues with an open mind and no partisan, political agenda. He or \nshe must have a keen understanding of the law and the ability to \nexplain it in ways the American people will understand.\n  Second, we hope he or she is someone who will represent the views of \npeople all across America, someone who will respect the Constitution.\n  Third, a qualified nominee must understand that the law is more than \nan intellectual game and more than a mental exercise. The law is about \nreal people, often facing the all-too-real challenges of raising \nfamilies and earning a living. Justice, after all, may be blind, but it \nshould not be deaf.\n  Finally, a nominee has to be willing to tell us how she or he will \nexercise the enormous power of their position. We need to know how the \nnominee sees the world and what he or she thinks about basic issues.\n  The Senate is about to begin one of its most solemn and important \nduties. As the confirmation process unfolds, I sincerely hope we \ncontinue to talk to and listen to each other, regardless of party and, \nmore importantly, to the people we represent.\n  I yield the floor to the Senator from New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, if reports are correct, less than 5 hours \nfrom now, President Bush will announce to the Nation his first \nnomination to the Supreme Court. This process and his choice will \nsurely make up a large part of his lasting legacy.\n  The President no doubt spent a great deal of time and thought before \nmaking the selection he will announce tonight, and I am hopeful--still \nhopeful--that it will be a truly consensus nominee, one we can all \nsupport and one that will serve this country well on the highest court \nin the land.\n  I must admit to some disappointment that President Bush did not do \nmore to consult with the Senate on this pick because, as many of us \nhave said all along, it is such consultation that helps ensure a smooth \nconfirmation process and a unified vote.\n  Had we been given some names beforehand, we would have been able to \ndo some due diligence before any announcement and be able to suggest to \nthe President who might quickly succeed and who might face a tougher \nroad to confirmation, just as Orrin Hatch did with President Clinton.\n  But be that as it may, tonight we start fresh and likely with a \nnominee who has not been vetted with the Senate beforehand. This will \nmake the upcoming hearings on this nominee that\n\n[[Page S8458]]\n\nmuch more important--perhaps the most important we have had in several \ngenerations. We, in the Senate, will soon begin to fulfill our \nconstitutional duty to advise and then to give or withhold our consent \non the President's nominee. Whomever the nominee, whether Edith \nClement, as many are rumoring, or another, there will be many tough \nquestions on a broad range of issues. It is my hope that every Member \nof the Senate will take this solemn duty seriously and move forward \nwith dignity, diligence, and a view toward coming to a deliberate, but \nnot dilatory, conclusion on whether the coming nominee should be on the \nSupreme Court.\n  Because Justice O'Connor was such a swing vote on so many issues \nvital to Americans, the answers this nominee gives at the hearings will \nbe of incredible importance in determining whether the nominee is \nsuitable for the Court.\n  So tonight is a momentous night--for President Bush, for the nominee, \nfor the Senate, and most of all for the country. We must renew our \ndetermination to fulfill this sacred trust with vigor and fairness, but \nwith thoroughness as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1242\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time on the Coburn amendment?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, for the information of Members of the \nSenate, what we are trying to do is set up a series of three votes, \nbetween an hour and 1\\1/2\\ hours on two Coburn amendments and a Dorgan \namendment. I will be back at the conclusion of Senator Coburn's remarks \nto propound a unanimous consent agreement that would lock in those \nthree votes around the time that I just suggested.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wonder if I might ask consent that I be \nrecognized following the debate on the Coburn-Boxer amendment to offer \nmy amendment. I would say I only require 15 minutes for myself on my \namendment. My guess is we would want to allocate 15 minutes to perhaps \nthe Presiding Officer or others in the Chamber who would oppose the \namendment, but that would be acceptable. I want to get it locked in so \nI could offer that amendment following the debate on the Coburn-Boxer \namendment.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I suggest that there be 15 minutes under the control \nof the Senator from North Dakota; 15 minutes under the control of the \noccupant of the chair or myself; 15 minutes under the control of \nSenator Martinez, and that debate commence at the expiration of the \ntime allocated that is about to start momentarily related to the Coburn \namendment.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I make that unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time on the Coburn amendment?\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, is the Coburn-Boxer amendment pending?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, it is. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I rise in support of an amendment that I \ncalled up earlier, the Coburn-Boxer amendment, banning the Export-\nImport Bank of the United States from funding construction of nuclear \nfacilities in the People's Republic of China.\n  I want the American people to know, and especially this body, that we \nare walking down a road using taxpayers' funds for low-interest loans \nto finance a British Government-owned company to sell U.S. nuclear \ntechnology to the Chinese Government, which has already said that after \nthey get that technology, they are going to take it and then they are \ngoing to start utilizing it to resell the same nuclear technology \naround the world. To me, that seems insane, that we would give a \nsubsidy to finance the export of technology--American technology owned \nby the British Government through the British Nuclear Fuels \nCorporation--to the Chinese, who will then take that technology, once \nthey build nuclear plants, own it themselves, and then sell that \nproduct around the world.\n  We are going to take the largest amount of money the Export-Import \nBank has ever used, $3.2 billion, a sum bigger than the Export-Import \nBank has ever loaned--$1.8 billion was the highest in the past--and we \nare going to subsidize a country that is holding $165 billion worth of \nour notes. We already owe them $165 billion. They have plenty of cash \nto finance this themselves. And the reason we are told we are going to \ndo this is it is going to help hold on to 5,000 jobs.\n  The fact is, if we take that same kind of subsidy, through our \nExport-Import Bank, and put it into venture capital, small business, \nresearch in this country, we would create hundreds of thousands of \njobs. So the only rationale for doing this is to hang on to some jobs. \nAnd we are going to ask the American taxpayer to subsidize this.\n\n  What happens if the Chinese do not pay back the loan? The American \ntaxpayer has to pay $5 billion. That is what happens if they, in fact, \ndo not pay it back. I do not know if that is realistic or not. I don't \nknow what is going to happen over the next 10 years to a $5 billion \nloan to a country that already is attempting to buy, through their \nGovernment, assets of this country's oil infrastructure.\n  I think it behooves us to have a vigorous debate on what our policy \nshould be with the Export-Import Bank and whether it is a shortsighted \npolicy to save 5,000 jobs. The actual logic behind that is that if we \ndon't do it, France will do it; France will beat us on this contract \nbecause the French Government will do it.\n  If we are going to invest $5 billion or put that on the line, let's \nloan it to small businesses across America. Let's invest in technology \nhere rather than invest in a corporation that is owned by the British. \nLet's invest in American corporations. Let's give American companies \nthis kind of benefit.\n  But, in fact, we have chosen to go down this path for a very good \nreason. It is important to save jobs. I don't mean to demean that \nwhatsoever. But it is a short-range answer to a very long-range \nproblem. If, in fact, $5 billion will save 5,000 jobs in the United \nStates, that is $100,000 a job. It is important for us to be clear \nabout what the intent is. The Export-Import Bank was designed to help \nus enhance our exports.\n  First of all, there are some jobs in California and Pennsylvania and \nLouisiana that are affected by this deal. It is not to say that those \njobs will not be there if this deal doesn't go through. As a matter of \nfact, I would say, as we look at the need for nuclear energy in the \nfuture in this country, most probably we are going to see some greater \ndemand from these companies. But I find it very ironic that a country \nthat has a trade surplus with us approaching $200 billion, that has a \nsignificant growth factor that is greater than ours, that is ``cash \nrich'' at this time to the tune of $165 billion just in U.S. Treasury \nsecurities, that the taxpayer ought to be financing the sale of nuclear \npowerplants and nuclear technology to China.\n  With that, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, my understanding is I have 20 minutes; is \nthat correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator is correct.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask to be notified when I have used 14 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be so notified.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank Senator Coburn for his work on \nthis amendment. I am very pleased to be a cosponsor.\n  As he explains, this amendment will stop the Export-Import Bank from \nfinancing a project to construct nuclear powerplants in China. Earlier \nthis year, the Ex-Im Bank agreed to provide $5 billion in loans or loan \nguarantees to the American subsidiary of a British company, \nWestinghouse Electric Company, so the company could bid on a contract \nto build nuclear powerplants in China.\n  This deal will, if we do not stop it, be the largest deal in the \nhistory of the Ex-Im Bank. In fact, it would be nearly\n\n[[Page S8459]]\n\nthree times larger than the bank's previous deal, a $1.7 billion \ntransaction in the mid-1980s. So this is not some small, \ninconsequential amendment. This is a big deal because this would be the \nbiggest deal of the Ex-Im Bank since the 1980s, and three times the \nsize of that deal. According to the Ex-Im Bank itself, some of these \nloans may go not to the company but directly to the Government of \nChina. What is going on here?\n  Over the last decade, China has emerged as an economic power. It is \nthe sixth largest economy in the world with a gross domestic product of \nover $1.65 trillion. The economy is growing at 9.5 percent.\n  What about our economic relationship with China? Last year, the \nUnited States had a trade deficit of $162 billion with China. This \nyear, the trade deficit may go over $200 billion. This is in part \nbecause China purposely undervalued its currency in order to dump \nprojects in America.\n  Just last month, a company that is majority-owned by the Chinese \nGovernment offered to buy the American company, Unocol, for $18.5 \nbillion. In addition--and this shocks me every time I read it--the \nChinese Government owns $230 billion of our Treasury bonds on which we \nare paying billions of dollars of interest. The Chinese Government is \nnot poor, and it does not need a loan backed by U.S. taxpayers.\n  What would that $5 billion loan be used for? It would be used to help \nWestinghouse build nuclear powerplants in China, one of the riskiest \ninvestments possible. Remember, as Senator Coburn has explained, \nWestinghouse is the American subsidiary of a large British company.\n  Since 1948, in the United States the nuclear power industry has \nreceived more than $66 billion of Federal research and development \nfunding. I am the first to say, the majority of Senators support these \ntypes of subsidies. Why? Because we have not seen a nuclear powerplant \nbuilt in America since 1973. Why? Because it is too risky an \ninvestment. But the Ex-Im Bank is prepared to put our American taxpayer \ndollars at risk for nuclear powerplants in China. Nuclear power is not \nonly a risky investment here, but think about nuclear powerplants being \nbuilt in China where the terribly weak standards on workplace safety \nglare out at us and the terribly weak standards of environmental \nprotection stand out. That in itself takes the risk to a whole new \nlevel.\n  There are several other aspects of this deal that do not make sense. \nIt comes down to the same bottom line: Why should we use American \ntaxpayer dollars for this risky investment? Again, the beneficiary is \nnot an American company but a subsidiary of a British-Government-owned \ncompany. The Brits are great allies. We love them. But let them put \ntheir taxpayers on the line. Why do we have to put our taxpayers on the \nline?\n  As Senator Coburn points out, the biggest argument against our \namendment is this will create 5,000 American jobs if we agree to this \nrisky loan. Let's ignore for a minute that the Chinese Government says \nit fully intends to develop for itself the ability to manufacture the \nparts that Westinghouse would be selling to them--a point made very \ndramatically by my colleague, Senator Coburn. The fact is, those 5,000 \njobs will not last very long when the Chinese learn how to do the work. \nBut, given that, that the 5,000 jobs will be created, we need to put \nthat number in context. We are talking about $5 billion in loans and \nloan guarantees. It will create 5,000 jobs.\n  U.S. manufacturers have estimated that China's undervaluation of its \ncurrency has resulted in the loss of 2 million American jobs. So why \ndon't we do something to change this persistent unfair trade practice \nand create 2 million jobs--if everything was fair--not 5,000 jobs? If \nwe can't do this through pressure by convincing the Chinese to change \ntheir practice or by pursuing a complaint with the WTO, surely there \nare easier ways to create 5,000 jobs.\n\n  For example, spending $100 million--2 percent of the size of this \ndeal--on transportation projects would create 5,000 jobs. According to \nthe measurements used by the Small Business Administration, $5 billion \nin loans and loan guarantees to American small businesses would create \n100,000 new jobs. What is wrong with this picture? If we are so ready \nto give loan guarantees, let's look at giving them right here to our \nsmall businesses. Of course we are not going down that path today. It \nis a point of priorities.\n  Count me out for this. The 5,000 jobs are not real. They will not \nlast long. It is a British-owned company. And we can do much more with \n$5 billion in loan guarantees to our small businesses and create \n100,000 jobs.\n  This Chinese nuclear powerplant deal is a bad deal from an American \njobs standpoint. Another thing that makes no sense is that in order to \nbuild the nuclear powerplants, we would be selling our advanced nuclear \ntechnology to China. I say to my colleagues, wake up.\n  Chinese Major General Zhu Chenghu said:\n\n       If the Americans draw their missiles and position-guided \n     ammunition into the target zone on China's territory, I think \n     we will have to respond with nuclear weapons.\n\n  The date was July 15, 4 days ago, that this major general threatened \nus with nuclear weapons.\n  The same major general said on the same day to the Asian Wall Street \nJournal on the Financial Times:\n\n       Of course the Americans will have to be prepared that \n     hundreds of, or two hundreds of (or) even more cities will be \n     destroyed by the Chinese.\n\n  I believe this was stated in the context of the Taiwan situation.\n  We are at the brink of giving a $5 billion loan, or loan guarantee, \npart of which, according to the Ex-Im Bank, will go directly to China \nto give them the technology they need so that this general can run \naround and make threats to use nuclear weapons. This is beyond belief. \nI hope and pray and maybe go so far as to trust this general is not \nreflective of reality in China.\n  But even if you do not believe this guy has any clout, what a time to \ngive them nuclear technology when one of their top military people is \nthreatening us. What a time to give them the opportunity to steal our \ntechnology.\n  China is one of the largest violators of U.S. intellectual property \nrights in the world. That is indisputable. Coming from California, I \nknow too well the piracy of American movies, music, software, and other \nproducts committed by China. It costs American businesses billions of \ndollars every year. A movie and a record represents millions and \nbillions of loss to my business people and American jobs, but it cannot \nkill. We are talking about nuclear technology. That can come back and \nbite us. We have to assume that the Chinese will pirate our nuclear \ntechnology if they pirate all our other technologies. They admit they \nare going to learn how to use it. When all is said, something is wrong \nwith this picture.\n  I conclude this portion of my remarks in this way. I will paint the \npicture as succinctly as I can. If the Ex-Im Bank's deal goes through, \nU.S. taxpayer dollars will be put at risk so that the Chinese \nGovernment can pay an American subsidiary of a British company to send \nU.S. nuclear technology to China where a major general has threatened \nto use nuclear weapons against the United States--all of this in order \nto undertake an incredibly risky financial investment, building nuclear \npowerplants. Not only is something wrong with this picture, something \nis horribly wrong with this picture.\n  Am I permitted to refer to a House vote on the Senate floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may so refer.\n  Mrs. BOXER. In the House of Representatives a very similar amendment \nwas offered. It passed with the type of coalition we see here, across \nthe aisle. It passed 3 to 1. We have an opportunity today to follow the \nlead of our colleagues who ask us to stand with them.\n  This deal makes no sense. The Coburn-Boxer amendment stops this deal \nin its tracks. I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment.\n  I retain the remainder of my time and defer to Senator McConnell.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, Senator Santorum wishes to use the time \nin opposition to the amendment. I believe he is on his way.\n  Mr. COBURN. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 14 minutes 38 seconds.\n  Mr. COBURN. I will yield such time as I may consume. I ask the \nPresiding\n\n[[Page S8460]]\n\nOfficer to notify me when I have 5 minutes remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be notified.\n  Mr. COBURN. A couple of points: No. 1, this is not just the British-\nowned corporation; this is a corporation owned by the British \nGovernment. There is a big difference. It is not a privately held \ncorporation. The British Government owns British Nuclear Fuels, which \nowns Westinghouse. If there is a subsidized loan that ought to go \nanywhere, it ought to come from the British, not the American \ntaxpayers.\n  Second, I spoke in error. It is not $100,000 per job but $1 million \nper job; $5 billion for 5,000 jobs is $1 million a job. That is what we \nare putting at risk to save 5,000 jobs.\n  The third point I make is we are not just offering a loan subsidy and \nguarantee to a Westinghouse power generation subsidiary of British \nNuclear Fuels owned by the British Government. We are also allowing a \nsubsidy for Mitsubishi Heavy Industries that also has a large portion \nof this deal. What we are doing is financing just as many jobs out of \nthe country as we are in the country. So the claim that we want to do \nthis to save 5,000 jobs means we are going to enhance the ability of \nthe Japanese steel manufacturers to compete with our steel \nmanufacturers because we are going to give them a guaranteed loan to \nsupply the steel for this facility.\n\n  It makes no sense. How do we best create more jobs in this country? \nWe trim Government spending. We cut taxes. We allow the entrepreneurs \nof this country, the people who have paid 14 percent more taxes this \nyear already, to have the money with which to invest. If we are not \ngoing to do that, then let's subsidize the small businessmen, the \nventure capitalists in this country. Let's put it into our own research \nand development, our own science and our own technology. If we are \ngoing to put the taxpayer on hold for $5 billion, I would much rather \ndo that than trying to collect it, because I think we would have a \ntough time trying to collect it from the Japanese if they did default. \nI don't think that would happen. But we start putting American \ntaxpayers', Americans' future at risk on something that does not make \nany sense.\n  I have a difference of opinion with the Senator from California about \nthe need for nuclear power. We differ on that. There is no question \nabout that. I happen to believe this very deal will come back to haunt \nus. I believe 20 years from now we will be buying nuclear powerplants \nfrom the Chinese rather than them buying from ourselves or from the \nBritish, because if you look at every other major manufacturer that has \na deal in China, one of the components to have the deal in China is to \ngive up your technology at the specified period of time. There isn't \none manufacturer over there today that has not agreed to license or \ngive away their technology for the opportunity to enter that market. \nThat is not free trade. That is extortion and that is what is going on \nin China today. To get into that big market and to have access to that \nlabor market, what American companies are doing is giving up their \nfuture. They are giving away their technology. And this is more of the \nsame. It is bad medicine for America. It is bad medicine for American \nworkers. It is bad medicine for investment in our own future \ntechnology. And it is bad medicine for the American taxpayer.\n  With that, I will reserve the remainder of my time.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time to the Senator?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume under the agreement.\n  Am I in control of the time in opposition?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from Pennsylvania, he controls the \ntime. He can use as much as he wishes.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment. I did not get a \nchance to hear all of the comments of Senator Coburn, and I did miss \nthe comments of the Senator from California, but let me address this \nissue as someone who represents a State--Senator Specter and I were in \na meeting so we could not be here for the debate, but we represent a \nState where a lot of these jobs are going to be located. Westinghouse \nNuclear is a large and important entity in our State, in western \nPennsylvania, and so for those who do not believe that jobs will accrue \nto the United States, let me assure you that I talked with the folks \nthere and they most certainly will. This technology is commercial \ntechnology. This is not a technology that is any threat from a national \nsecurity point of view. This is commercial nuclear power technology. As \nwe all know, China has nuclear powerplants and we also know China has \nalso nuclear weapons.\n  The idea that this is a national security issue is not a relevant \none, No. 1. No. 2, is this an appropriate use of taxpayer dollars? I \nthink I heard the Senator from Oklahoma say he does not expect the \nChinese Government to default on the purchase of these nuclear reactors \nand I think it is pretty safe to say they will not default. So this \nidea that this is putting taxpayer money at risk is probably \noverstating the point, that in fact this $5 billion loan guarantee is \nonly going to cost the taxpayers dollars if in fact the Chinese \nGovernment defaults. The likelihood of that, according to the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma, is very slim. So the question is should the Export-\nImport Bank get involved in financing and supporting an American \ncompany that wants to do business in competition in China versus a \nEuropean and Russian competitor, when the European and Russian \ncompetitor is, like the U.S. Ex-Im Bank, supporting and financially \nbacking the transaction? I guess the answer could be no, we don't want \nto participate, we don't want to compete in China, we don't want to \nhave this technology be used in the construction of 4 good, safe \nnuclear plants, with a prospective 24 plants being built in the future. \nThe 5,000 to 7,000 jobs that we talk about are real jobs, they are \nhigh-paying jobs, they are high-tech jobs. When we build a powerplant, \nwe are not building something we can provide to China from here in the \nUnited States. We can't send power to China. It is not as though we are \ngoing to be able to build something here and export it to China. This \nis energy capacity they need in China.\n\n  I might ask the question, well, what if we do not build nuclear \nplants? If we don't, then they are going to put more demand on the \nglobal need for oil and gas as well as coal. So if they are not \nbuilding technology, they are going to be driving up demand for fuels \nwe need and driving up the cost of those fuels. So we should be \nencouraging them to build this kind of technology, just as many of us \nare encouraging us to build this kind of technology so we don't put \nmore demand on our petroleum resources, natural gas resources, and coal \nresources. I think it is a wise move for China to be building this kind \nof generating capacity. It is good for the global economy that they are \nbuilding this kind of generating capacity. It is good for American jobs \nthat we are in fact competing to build this generating capacity using \nAmerican technology, something that can't be built here.\n  I understand people have very strong feelings about China right now, \nand I am one of them. I voted for some of the toughest measures we have \ndealt with here on the Senate floor trying to send a message to China, \nbut I don't know how this sends a message to China, to say that, well, \nnow we don't want these jobs, let the French and let the Russians have \nthese jobs, and let them create economic prosperity in those two \ncountries, and let them build the technology in China, and we will \nsacrifice the jobs at no cost to the American taxpayer, if we accept \nthe fact they are not going to default on this loan.\n  Mr. COBURN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Yes, I will be happy to yield to the Senator from \nOklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. I understand we are competing in the global economy and \nthe French or the Russians are going to subsidize it, but the fact is \nthis is a\n\n[[Page S8461]]\n\nvery low interest rate. We are borrowing money from China today and \npaying over 4 percent and we are going to finance this at less than \nthat, so the cost to the taxpayer is real. There is a real cost to the \nAmerican taxpayer. It is the difference between at what rate they \ninvest and the interest rate we pay to them and at what rate we are \ngoing to subsidize this loan. So there is a cost to the taxpayer.\n  The other thought I hope the Senator would agree with is, this is not \njust to Westinghouse, which is owned by the British Government, not a \nBritish corporation. This is also to Mitsubishi Steel because we are \nnow going to take American taxpayer dollars, the difference between \nwhat we are paying on their notes that they are investing, their cash \ninvestment here, and we are going to subsidize a Japanese company. I \nhope the Senator would agree we shouldn't be doing that.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Two things. First, the Senator is right, Westinghouse \nis owned by an entity owned by the British Government. As you probably \nalso know, there have been widely spread reports that they are selling \nthat division, they are selling Westinghouse. So probably by the time \nthis deal goes through, it will not be owned by the British Government \nand will be--by the way, I don't have anything against the British \nGovernment. They have been great allies and I don't want to suggest \nsomehow that I am speaking ill of that entity. All I am suggesting is \nWestinghouse is clearly, according to news reports, going to be spun \noff and sold and maybe recapitalize itself as an American company. \nNevertheless, the jobs are here. The benefit is here. With respect to \nMitsubishi, if it is your test then to suggest that any project being \nbuilt has to be built with all-American steel, all-American concrete, \nall-American--obviously, in a global economy that is not going to \nhappen, particularly if you are building a product in China.\n  Mr. COBURN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. In one second. So I would suggest, yes, there will be \nlots of corporations around the world that are part of this deal to \nbuild this reactor that would benefit from this, just as probably you \ncould make the argument--and I don't want to make it for you, but I \nwill make it for you--there may be an American company that benefits \nfrom the French building this reactor but certainly not to the extent \nif Westinghouse builds it.\n  Mr. COBURN. Would the Senator agree that today this is a British-\nGovernment-owned company and that the profits from this will accrue to \nthe benefit of the Mitsubishi Corporation and Shaw Corporation? Why in \nthe world wouldn't those two governments be subsidizing the loan rather \nthan this government?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Well, again, Westinghouse is a company based in the \nUnited States. As you know, we have multinational companies that are \nheadquartered all around the world. But the bottom line is Westinghouse \nis a U.S. company, it pays U.S. taxes, it has a U.S. payroll, and that \nis where the AP1000 is being built. The AP1000 is something that was \ndesigned--I went and saw it in Pittsburgh, PA. These are the folks who \nhave the technology. These are the folks who are going to be building \nand constructing this plant.\n  I am sure there may be some profit. Obviously, I am sure they would \nnot be bidding if they didn't think there was profit. But the profit is \nin this U.S.-based subsidiary. And so I would suggest that the \noverwhelming benefit is coming to the United States, not to the British \nholding company.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. The Senator from Pennsylvania didn't hear the debate \nabout the $5 billion loan guarantee, and what that would turn into if \nwe did the same type of thing for other American-owned corporations and \ninvested here. As the Senator from California outlined, the difference \nis a $100 million investment in highways will produce 5,000 jobs; $100 \nmillion invested in small businesses will produce 5,000 jobs.\n  I still stand by the contention that this subsidy--and that is what \nit is. We need to make sure we talk about what this really is. This is \na subsidy by the American taxpayer, and it is going to cost them money \nbecause we are going to loan money at lower than we are borrowing now \nso there is a net cost to the American taxpayers for doing this. Even \nif they do pay it back, we are still going to be losing the jobs.\n  What we have to recognize is our fiduciary responsibility. The \nfastest growing cost to the Federal Government is net interest. We are \ngoing to boot it up $5 billion, times about 1.5 percent, and that \nhappens to be about $50 million a year that we are going to ask our \ngrandkids to pay to subsidize this deal. Take $50 million. Can't we \ninvest that $50 million in a better way? Can't we invest the true cost \nof this deal, about $50 million a year to the American taxpayer, in \nsome other way to create 5,000 jobs in the future that will be here \nforever? We have already heard them say they have every intention of \ntaking this technology; at the end of 10 years, it will be their \ntechnology and they will build their own plant, and there will be no \nbenefit to Westinghouse or the British Government or Mitsubishi Steel \nor Shaw Corporation. There will be none because they will do as they \nhave done on every other issue: They take the technology; once it \nbecomes theirs, they will just duplicate it. Or if it doesn't become \ntheirs legally, they reverse engineer it.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield to me?\n  Mr. COBURN. I am happy to.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Again, I thank the Senator for his leadership on this \nissue.\n  Mr. COBURN. Will the Senator yield so I can find out how much time I \nhave?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 7\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time. I will \nbe happy to yield time if the Senator comes up short.\n  Mrs. BOXER. All right. Very good.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, what I was going to ask the Senator--but \nit is more a rhetorical question--is, Why does China need this money \nanyway? We already owe China $230 billion they have loaned us buying \nour Treasury bills. We pay them now billions of dollars of interest--\nbillions, multibillions. I was going to ask my friend a question, but \nit was a rhetorical question. The Chinese do not need any more dollars. \nThey have dollars all right. They have so many dollars it is \nunbelievable: dollars from the trade deficit that is huge and climbing. \nThey have the interest payments that we pay them.\n  Now they need another $5 billion? This is the most outrageous thing I \nhave seen come across my desk. I will tell you this: If we cannot win \nthis amendment, I say to my friend, I do not know who we are here \nfighting for. It does not make any sense. Set aside our differences on \nnuclear power, that does not even have to come into it. My friend from \nPennsylvania says there is not a risk? Give me a break. Talk to any \nAmerican businessman who has done business in China. I meet them all \nthe time in California. Oh, everything is promised. Oh, it is all going \nto be great. Somehow it does not happen, and they are left holding the \nbag.\n  I wish I could protect my California businesspeople. I cannot. But I \nsure can protect my California taxpayers. For 5,000 jobs in \nPennsylvania--which, by the way, the Chinese Government admits they are \ngoing to take the technology. They admit it. I will give them that. And \nthey are going to replace those 5,000 workers.\n  In light of what the general said 4 days ago: The Americans will have \nto be prepared that hundreds of or two hundreds of or even more cities \nwill be destroyed by the Chinese with nuclear weapons--he says: We'll \nhave to respond with nuclear weapons--that is what he said in light of \na conversation about Taiwan.\n  So what is wrong with this picture? We are putting taxpayers on the \nhook for $5 billion in loans and loan guarantees to a British-\nGovernment-owned subsidiary, where it will create, in the short term, \n5,000 jobs, what the Chinese say will not be long-lasting, to give them \nnuclear technology so they can build better weapons against us and have \nmore materials to use against us. It makes no sense.\n  I want to create 100,000 jobs in America. I want to create 2 million \njobs in America. Do you know how we can do\n\n[[Page S8462]]\n\nthat? By cracking down on the way the Chinese deal with their currency. \nIf they would allow their currency to float, we would create more than \n2 million jobs in America, and it would not put the taxpayers on the \nhook for anything.\n  As my colleague from Oklahoma said--as we both have said--if you want \nto put up $5 billion in loan guarantees, why not do it for American \nsmall businesses, and instead of creating 5,000 jobs, create 100,000 \njobs. If that is my choice, I come down on the side of the American \nworker. This is 5,000 jobs, at $1 million a job. This makes no sense \nwhatsoever--and putting the taxpayers on the hook.\n  So no matter how I look at it, the Chinese do not need this money. \nAnd do you know what I say? Let the Russians have this deal. Let the \nFrench have this deal. Let the French put their taxpayers at risk. Let \nthe Russians put their taxpayers at risk. I am not moving forward \ntoward this deal, which is the largest deal ever done by Ex-Im Bank, to \nbenefit a country that has threatened us with nuclear weapons, at least \nthe major general has.\n  This is insane. If anything should garner a big bipartisan vote, it \nis the Coburn-Boxer amendment. We do not team up that often. We have a \ncouple times. This is really interesting. And we do it for different \nreasons. But do you know what? Overall, it is looking out after the \ntaxpayer. That is the bottom line of this particular amendment.\n  There are many issues where I could stand up on this floor and say to \nmy tax-paying constituents: There are certain things that I think are \nworth investing in. I think it is worth investing in No Child Left \nBehind and making sure our kids can read and write. Yes, it is going to \ncost money. Yes, it is a bit of a risk because some of the kids may not \nlearn, and that is a problem. I guess you could argue with that. But I \nthink, overall, the benefits outweigh the risks.\n  What is the benefit here to give over technology that the Chinese say \nthey are going to learn; they are going to replace the American \nworkers; they will have technology they can use against us? I think it \nis a bad deal. It is bad for the American taxpayer. It is a terrible \nmessage to send from a foreign policy point of view. The jobs we are \ncreating are costing $1 million a job. They are very few jobs. They \nwill not last long.\n  I cannot say enough how I hope this amendment will be adopted with an \noverwhelming vote.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time and suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from California withhold the \nsuggestion of an absence of a quorum?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes, I do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I yield 9 minutes to the Senator from \nCalifornia, Mrs. Feinstein.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I always regret having to oppose an \namendment proposed by my friend and colleague from California, but I am \nafraid I must. I have a very hard time understanding this amendment and \nunderstanding why we would even do it.\n  I believe, if this amendment is adopted, it is a free gift to the \nFrench, the Russians, and other European contractors who would have \nbeen provided a majoring advantage over their U.S. counterparts. \nSecondly, it will only lead to a further increase of greenhouse gases \nin China. Thirdly, it will result in the initial loss of American jobs \nand potentially many thousands in the future. Finally, it would mean a \nlost opportunity to address our rising trade deficit with China and to \ncooperate in finding efficient sources of energy.\n  I have been going to China for over 30 years now. I try to go every \nyear. As mayor, I started a relationship with Shanghai. I traveled \neast, west, north, and south in China. China needs energy. All anybody \nhas to do is be in China in the middle of the summer or the winter and \nsee the effect of this coal-burning country.\n  Do you remember when they wanted to build hydroelectric power and \nbuild the Three Gorges Dam and people in this country objected to it? \nThey said: It is too big. And the Three Gorges Dam, the largest \nhydroelectric dam in the world, will only handle 5 percent of the \nenergy needs of China. So China has to go somewhere. China has to find \na source of clean power.\n  This provision, I believe, would essentially shut out U.S. firms from \nbeing able to compete with their counterparts in Europe and, for all \npractical purposes, cede billions of dollars worth of contracts to non-\nAmerican companies.\n  No matter what our personal views on nuclear power and the \nconstruction of nuclear powerplants in the United States--that is our \nbusiness--it is clear that China intends to proceed with at least 30 \nnuclear powerplants, the most advanced and the cleanest yet known to \nman, over the next decade. This is China's decision, and it is their \nright to make this decision.\n  China, as its economy continues to expand by over 9 percent annually, \nis deeply concerned about an energy shortfall. As the world's No. 2 \nconsumer of energy, China currently imports 40 percent of its oil \nsupplies.\n  As its economy continues to grow--and it will--China will need to \nfind additional and greater sources of energy. We do not want them to \nrival us as we look for those sources of energy.\n  Let me give you an example. The International Energy Agency, in its \n2004 annual report, predicts that China's oil imports will increase by \nsome 500 percent by 2030.\n  Despite the negative impacts on its citizens' health and its \ncontribution to greenhouse gases, China remains the world's largest \nproducer and consumer of coal. Coal continues to make up two-thirds of \nenergy consumption in China, and it is predicted that coal consumption \nwill only double over the next two decades.\n  Currently, the second largest emitter of greenhouse gases--behind \nus--China is expected to surpass the United States as the world's \nlargest emitter of greenhouse gases by 2025. In an attempt to increase \nits reliance on cleaner, more efficient energy sources, China has been \nworking to develop natural gas, hydroelectric power, and nuclear \nenergy.\n  Now, while nuclear energy is not a panacea for all of China's energy \nneeds, it offers one of the most efficient and cleaner sources of \nenergy. And it is certainly superior to coal.\n  In the next 20 years, China is expected to top the world in nuclear \npower development. So I ask, what is the point of this amendment? Why \nwould we want to pass legislation that would hurt American companies \nand try to tell China what sort of energy it can develop?\n  I could understand if this was sensitive nuclear technology and had \nnational security implications. But it has been vetted, and that is \nsimply not the case. The administration--and, in particular, the \nDepartment of Commerce and the Department of Energy--has reviewed this \ntechnology and has offered its unequivocal support for American firms \nbidding or subcontracting on these projects.\n  In the first project that would involve American technology, a \nmultinational consortium, including the American Shaw group, is looking \nto design and construct four AP1000 pressurized water reactors on two \nsites in central and southern China. This AP1000 advanced nuclear \npowerplant will be the new standard for nuclear power throughout the \nglobe and lead to thousands of high-tech jobs for Americans for many \nyears to come.\n  In February 2005, the Ex-Im Bank gave a preliminary commitment to \nprovide $5 billion of assistance to this consortium. Should this \namendment pass today, it would mean the loss of at least 5,000 high-\ntech jobs throughout the Nation and could well set a precedent that \nprecludes any American company from bidding on nuclear powerplant \nprojects in China.\n  By passing this amendment, we essentially hand the contract to either \nthe French or the Russians, who have the full support and backing of \ntheir respective governments.\n  With our trade deficit with China nearing $200 billion, I simply \ncannot understand why we would not want to provide American firms the \nbest opportunity to successfully bid on these projects in China. For \nthose, like myself, who have raised concerns with Chinese leaders about \nthis unacceptable trade imbalance, it would seem counterproductive to \nsupport such an amendment.\n\n[[Page S8463]]\n\n  Some have raised concerns about the decision by the Ex-Im Bank to \nprovide financial assistance to a multinational consortium that \nincludes non-American companies, suggesting that the bank is going \nbeyond its mandate.\n  But the fact is, the Ex-Im Bank's primary responsibility is to assist \nin creating American jobs and export growth for the U.S. economy.\n  With this mission in mind, since 1987, the Ex-Im Bank has financially \nsupported equipment and services for several overseas nuclear power \nprojects, providing these loans at fee-for-service.\n  Despite what you may hear, American taxpayers do not subsidize these \nEx-Im Bank loans to other countries and are not at credit risk.\n  Even in cases where the primary contractor may not be an American-\nowned company, these projects will spawn millions of dollars' worth of \nbusiness for American subcontractors.\n  The fact is, China already has extensive nuclear power production. \nThis is China's choice to pursue the construction of nuclear \npowerplants. We should not be telling China, which needs an increasing \nnumber of energy options, what to do.\n  Energy sufficiency has increasingly become a central component of \nChina's long-term economic growth and development, and could have deep \nsecurity implications as well.\n  I believe it is vital for the United States and China to cooperate in \norder to avoid future tensions and conflicts over securing energy \nresources. If this amendment passes, you can be sure there will be \nthese conflicts. Therefore, in my view, working with China is \nimportant.\n  I oppose this amendment. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I listened very intently to the words of \nthe Senator from California. I am somewhat confused. If in fact the \nAmerican contractor, i.e. Bechtel, working with the British-owned \ncompany, not an American company, gets this contract, it will have an \neffect on reducing coal utilization. But in her first statement, the \nSenator said if the American company consortium doesn't get it, the \nFrench or Russians will. So the argument about coal and greenhouse \ngases doesn't fly. They are going to go with nuclear, much like this \ncountry should be doing, except we don't have the wisdom to do that.\n  The fact is, we will be subsidizing the difference in the rate. Loans \nfor nuclear powerplants are high-risk loans. There are not many \ncommercial lenders that will lend for that, and when they do lend for \nit, you pay a premium. This is going to be a subsidized loan that will \ncost somewhere between $50 million and $100 million per year to the \nAmerican taxpayer. What could we do with another $50 million or $100 \nmillion to produce jobs? I am all for producing jobs. I want \nWestinghouse to produce lots of nuclear plants. I believe it is safe \nand smart for us to use nuclear power. Every time we have seen a \nproblem in this country, the power systems and safety systems have \nworked.\n  The debate is not whether I want nuclear power. I have been on record \nfor nuclear power for a long time. I am not an advocate of us \nsubsidizing the British Government, the Japanese Government, and their \nbusinesses, and having the American taxpayers pay for it.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. COBURN. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. My staff has been checking this. We cannot figure out \nwhere the Senator is coming up with the $50 million to $100 million \nfigure, since the Ex-Im Bank has not decided how they are going to \nstructure the transaction yet.\n  Mr. COBURN. The assumption is, if this becomes an Export-Import Bank \nloan, then it, in fact, will be at a rate less than what China could \nborrow in the international markets for the same thing. If you go out \nand check loans on nuclear powerplants, what you see is they are high-\npremium loans because there is a lot of risk. Whatever they do, if \nthey, in fact, finance it, or if they, in fact, guarantee it and don't \nfinance it, the rate is going to come down, so that builds the risk for \nthe American people. I agree, they probably will pay it back. My \nargument is, whatever it is, if we are subsidizing it, either through \nthe auspices of a guarantee or a loan through a reduced rate, what \ncould we be using that same buying power for here?\n  So there is an economic cost. If we put $5 billion over here, it is \ngoing to cost us by not putting it somewhere else in terms of loan \nguarantees. The question is not whether we ought to have a vibrant \nnuclear power industry in this country. The question in my mind is \nthis. I understand the global economy. You are talking about the vast \nmajority of the major players in this not being American companies--the \nvast majority. Although Westinghouse employs Americans, the profits \nthat inure to Westinghouse through a loan guarantee for subsidy go to \nthe British, not to Americans. That government owns it through the \nnuclear power unit, the research fuels unit of the British Government, \nBritish Nuclear Fuels. They own it 100 percent.\n\n  We can muddy the water on who owns it. The fact is, American \ntaxpayers should not be on the hook for subsidizing or guaranteeing \nwhat should be subsidized or guaranteed by the Japanese and British \nGovernments. If they think this is a great deal--and I am all for \nreducing our deficit with China. I voted for looking at the floating of \nthe currency, so I am with the Senator from Pennsylvania; but I don't \nbelieve we should put our grandchildren and our children at risk when \nwe can use the money much more wisely and our credit rating more \nwisely.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I inquire how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There remains 3 minutes 10 seconds.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask this question. You are aware that \nthere is an exposure fee that is paid by the company to the Ex-Im Bank, \nwhich is calculated to cover the credit risk of the transaction, so the \ncredit cost to the taxpayer would be zeroed out through this exposure.\n  Mr. COBURN. Would the Senator like to yield back to me?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I am asking a question.\n  Mr. COBURN. The fact is, there should be no risk to the American \npeople on this deal, period. There is risk. There is a guarantee for \nthe full faith and credit of the United States through the Export-\nImport Bank to finance the vast majority of a British-owned company--a \nBritish-Government-owned company, not by the taxpayer, but a British-\nowned company and a Japanese company and a smaller American company. So \nmy basic position is we should not have that risk placed on our \nchildren or grandchildren.\n  The other issue that is important is that they have already said they \nare going to take the technology at the end of 10 years. I cannot \nbelieve we are saying at the end of 10 years whatever advantage we have \nthey are going to get. We agreed in this deal that they get it. They \nare going to be turning around and selling nuclear powerplants to us.\n  We ought to be doing something different. If this is the only way we \ncan put jobs out there, by competing on subsidies with the French and \nRussians, we have lost the innovative spirit of America. We need to get \nback to investing in hard reserve, entrepreneurship, and in small \nbusiness. We will create more jobs and more industries. If we keep \nplaying the game of government-run subsidies and guarantees to buy \nbusiness--because that is what we are doing. Why did the Chinese choose \nthis one over the others? Because it is the best economic deal. They \nare essentially equivalent as to what they can buy. We are buying \nbusiness. When you start buying business, it marks the end of your \nability to compete.\n  With that, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Pennsylvania \nhas 1 minute. The Senators from Oklahoma and California have a minute \neach. The Senator from Vermont has 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I will reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would be willing to yield back my time, \nif the others are, to accommodate the chairman of the subcommittee.\n\n[[Page S8464]]\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Under the unanimous consent agreement, I believe we \nimmediately move to debate on the Dorgan amendment as soon as time \nexpires on the Coburn-Boxer amendment. Am I hearing that all of the \nremaining time might be yielded back?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I just need a minute and then I am done.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will take just 30 seconds.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I think I am hearing that Senators Santorum and Boxer \nwould like to use the remainder of their time.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Once they have finished their time, I will ask unanimous \nconsent that my time be yielded back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, this is about reducing the trade deficit \nwith China, about creating American jobs, and about creating high-tech, \nhigh-quality, good-paying jobs in America, to build something that we \ncannot export to China, something that we cannot build here and send to \nChina, something that China desperately needs.\n  As the Senator from California said, it will reduce emissions in \nChina. The reason we will get this contract is because we have the best \ntechnology. AP-1000 is the best technology. They are not going to buy \nthe best technology if we are uncompetitive in the financing and \nbecause of the subsidies of the French and Russian Governments.\n  We are trying to put up the best technology, developed with the best \nknow-how, which is what the Senator from Oklahoma said we should be \ndoing, but we cannot compete on an uneven playing field. This will even \nup the playing field. It costs nothing to the taxpayers. There is an \nexposure fee covering the credit risk.\n  In all likelihood, there will be a guarantee. If anybody believes the \nChinese Government will not come through on their guarantee, I have a \nbridge to sell you. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the Coburn-Boxer amendment will stop us \nfrom putting at risk $5 billion of taxpayer money. My colleague from \nPennsylvania can say all he wants that he believes the Chinese will \nnever default, no problem, just come and talk to the business people \nwho have made investments in China. It hasn't been a pretty picture.\n  The fact is, if this is about creating jobs, the Senator from \nOklahoma and I and others have shown much better ways to create far \nmore jobs that will really benefit the American people. This is \nsomething that we should not do.\n  I am on the Foreign Relations Committee with my colleague in the \nchair, and we are very proud of that committee. We want to be known as \n``Uncle Sam.'' We don't want to be known as ``Uncle Sucker.'' I think \nwe have a chance tonight to say we are Uncle Sam; we are not Uncle \nSucker. We are going to protect the taxpayers and American jobs. I hope \nwe will have an overwhelming vote, just as the House voted for a \nsimilar amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask our colleagues to look at this for \nwhat it is. In the long run, we don't win; we lose. Even if it costs us \nnothing in terms of finance charges, in the long run the technology \ngoes to China. We need to be investing in real jobs, real science, real \nentrepreneurs, and small business. We can create high-paying jobs. We \nhave done that. I hope the body will do that.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, is it correct that the pending business \nnow is the Dorgan amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct. The order anticipates the \noffering of the Dorgan amendment.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The time division on that amendment is 15 minutes for \nSenator Dorgan and 15 minutes under the control of Senator Martinez.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, my colleague from Florida, the senior \nSenator from Florida, I understand is interested in participating in \nthe debate. At the request of the majority whip, I will be happy to \nyield a portion of my time. I have not discussed that.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I suggest that the Senator from Florida \ngo ahead and begin his remarks. If his colleague arrives, he can make \nsure he has time left to yield to him.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. I thought maybe the proponent would want to go first. I \nam happy to have him go, and I will respond once he has an opportunity \nto present his amendment.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, are we in a quorum call?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is not in a quorum call. The \nSenator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am waiting a minute for something to be \ndelivered from the cloakroom. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1294\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am offering an amendment. The amendment \nI offer today is very simple. It is an amendment that will eliminate \nthe $21 million in this appropriations bill for something called \nTelevision Marti and will instead use that $21 million to restore \nfunding for the Peace Corps. The Peace Corps has been cut by $25 \nmillion. This would restore most of that $25 million. It would restore, \nin fact, the $21 million that is allocated for Television Marti.\n  Let me talk for a moment about Television Marti. It is for the \npurpose of broadcasting signals into the island of Cuba, apparently to \ntell the Cubans the truth, to tell them Castro is an awful person. I \nwould agree with that, that they ought to live free. We ought to find a \nway to move Cuba toward freedom.\n  We have Radio Marti that sends radio signals into Cuba. I have been \nto Cuba. The Cuban people told me they receive the radio signals. Of \ncourse, they can also receive the signals of the Miami radio stations, \nbut Radio Marti is something that is valuable, is important, we should \nfund and will fund. I support it.\n  Television Marti, on the other hand, is a tragic, complete waste of \nmoney. We have now spent a substantial amount of money, $189 million, \nsending television broadcast into Cuba that the Cuban people cannot \nsee.\n  Let me tell you how we do that. This is a picture of Fat Albert. Fat \nAlbert is an aerostat balloon. We have this balloon go way up into the \nair and then, on a big tether, it broadcasts television signals into \nCuba. Castro, through his technology, blocks the signals so the Cuban \npeople cannot see them. So we have $189 million we have spent to send \nbroadcast signals to Cuba that the Cuban people cannot receive.\n  We will hear people say today: That is not true, the Cuban people are \nreceiving it. I am sorry, they are not. They just are not. There is no \nevidence they are receiving it, except very sporadically and in only a \nfew spots in Cuba.\n  In fact, there have been some surveys that used to be taken and they \nhave discontinued them because they could not find anyone who saw \nTelevision Marti and it was kind of embarrassing. On June 6, 2002, \nBrian Conniff, the acting director of the International Broadcasting \nBureau, testified before the House subcommittee and said this. He is \nspeaking of TV Marti:\n\n       Transmission to Cuba has been consistently jammed by the \n     Cuban Government.\n\n  Let me say that again. This is not me. This is the person in the \nadministration who is the acting director of the International \nBroadcasting Bureau. He said:\n\n       Transmission of these signals to Cuba has been consistently \n     jammed by the Cuban Government.\n\n  So we spend $189 million to send television signals that they cannot \nsee in Cuba. Maybe it makes people feel better to waste that money. It \ndoes not make me feel any better. There is $21 million proposed in this \nappropriations\n\n[[Page S8465]]\n\nbill. I say better use that to restore the funding for the Peace Corps \nwhere we need the money.\n  This Fat Albert aerostat balloon was up on a tether broadcasting \nsignals no one could see. Fat Albert actually got loose once. They \ntracked it down. It flew over by the Everglades. They had to grapple up \nand find the hooks to get ahold of Fat Albert.\n  In all, $189 million of the taxpayers' money has been spent to send \ntelevision signals into Cuba that the people cannot see. That was not \nenough, however. The President announced he was going to get tough with \nCuba recently so he restricted the right of people to travel in Cuba. I \nam talking about United States visitors to Cuba, including, by the way, \nSergeant Lazo, who earned the Bronze Star Medal for bravery in Iraq. He \ncame back to this country and had a sick child in Cuba and was denied \nthe freedom by this Government to visit his sick child. We had a vote \non that issue on the floor of this Senate. Sixty Senators voted to let \nhim see his child. We needed 63 votes. So this Senate decided to deny a \nsoldier who won the Bronze Star Medal in Iraq the freedom to see his \nsick child in Cuba. That is another debate for another time, but it \nshows the obsession of this policy with Fidel Castro.\n\n  Castro has lived through 10 Presidents. This embargo doesn't work. We \nunderstand it. This is a big, fat batch of politics dealing with \nparticularly Florida, also New Jersey, and a couple of other spots in \nthe country.\n  The President announced he is going to get tough. On October 10, \n2003, in the Rose Garden, he said: We are going to get tough with Cuba. \nHe says now instead of just Fat Albert, we are going to use Commando \nSolo C-130s. There are only a few of these planes. These are some real \ntechnology-laden airplanes that have been developed to use in combat \nareas for communications, specific communication areas. And so they fly \nthis airplane.\n  I didn't mention, by the way, that the broadcast signals from old Fat \nAlbert into Cuba occurred from 3:30 in the morning until 8:30 in the \nmorning. Under the best of circumstances--let's assume nobody is \njamming signals--one would wonder what kind of audience exists at 3:30 \nin the morning in Cuba. Notwithstanding that, they come up with this \nairplane. They expropriate this airplane from the National Guard, one \nof a few airplanes called Commando Solo. The C-130, with very special \nequipment, is now flying 4\\1/2\\ hours a week--let me say that again, \n4\\1/2\\ hours a week--broadcasting signals into Cuba--signals, by the \nway, which are still jammed.\n  They say this jamming has now been overcome by this Commando Solo, \nthis new airplane. Let me quote Chris Courson, former chairman of the \nPresident's Board Of Advisers on Broadcasting to Cuba. He was appointed \nto that position by the first President Bush. Until 6 years ago, TV \nMarti used to conduct exit interviews with Cubans coming to the United \nStates on rafts and to determine whether Cubans, in fact, watch TV \nMarti. From the interviews, it was clear TV Marti was seen by virtually \nno one in Cuba. And finally, they stopped doing interviews altogether, \nand they have no idea whether anybody from Cuba is watching these \nprograms. In fact, these programs are being jammed.\n  We are going to hear, I am sure, today somehow somebody in Cuba is \npicking up the television signal. There is no credible evidence of \nthat, except at most for a few sporadic reports from isolated spots in \nthe Cuban hinterlands.\n  This is a terrible waste of the taxpayers' money. First with a big, \nold balloon, an aerostat balloon called Fat Albert, and second with \nCommando Solo. And now to top it off--failure is not anything that \nslows anybody down around here or at the White House--to top it all \noff, they want to buy a new airplane. They took one from the National \nGuard, Commando Solo, a handful of special airplanes, but that wasn't \nenough. Now they want to buy an entirely new airplane. They get $21 \nmillion this year. Better it should be used, in my judgment, for the \nPeace Corps.\n  I have often wondered whether everything has a constituency in this \nCongress. It is quite clear, to me at least, that waste has a \nconstituency. Waste has a relentless constituency. This is not the \nfirst time we have tried to shut this funding down. I think my \ncolleague Dale Bumpers and I some years ago were trying to shut this \ndown. But this keeps moving along. Waste has an enormous constituency \nhere. Keep doing it. It doesn't matter if they can't see it; if it \ndoesn't work, it doesn't matter what the facts are, keep doing it. It \nis as if the taxpayers have pockets with no bottoms. Have them ante up \nfor a big balloon, ante up for an airplane, and send signals nobody can \nsee.\n  People in Cuba are jumping on rafts to come here. They deserve to be \nable to have a new government. They deserve freedom and democracy. \nRadio Marti gives them the hope of that; it gives them some \ninformation. So, too, does Cuban radio off the radio stations in Miami \nor the regular radio stations in Miami which they can pick up. But \nTelevision Marti? If they can't get the signal, do we keep sending it?\n  Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). The Senator has 5 minutes 20 \nseconds remaining.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I send my amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I send this amendment to the desk on behalf of myself and \nSenator Wyden.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Will the Senator yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will first report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan], for himself and \n     Mr. Wyden, proposes an amendment numbered 1294.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To provide that no funds may be made available to provide \ntelevision broadcasting to Cuba, to increase by $21,100,000 the amount \n appropriated to the Peace Corps, and to reduce by the same amount the \n    amount appropriated under title I to the Broadcasting Board of \n                  Governors for broadcasting to Cuba)\n\n       On page 227, beginning on line 13, strike ``headings \n     `Foreign Military Financing Program' and `Broadcasting to \n     Cuba' '' and insert ``heading `Foreign Military Financing \n     Program' ''.\n       On page 326, between lines 10 and 11, insert the following:\n\n\n             PROHIBITION ON TELEVISION BROADCASTING TO CUBA\n\n       Sec. 6113. (a) None of the funds appropriated under this \n     Act may be made available to provide television broadcasting \n     to Cuba.\n       (b) The amount appropriated by title III under the heading \n     ``peace corps'' is hereby increased by $21,100,000.\n       (c) The amount appropriated by title I to the Broadcasting \n     Board of Governors under the heading ``broadcasting to cuba'' \n     is hereby reduced by $21,100,000.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Kentucky how we \nallocate the time. I know we have two Senators who want to speak in \nopposition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I believe there is 15 minutes on the \nside of the opposition. I think I heard the junior Senator from Florida \noffer to divide the time with the senior Senator from Florida.\n  I will take a moment to propose a unanimous-consent request related \nto several amendments so we can stack these votes for the very near \nfuture.\n  I ask unanimous consent that following debate on the current \namendment, the Dorgan amendment, that there then be 5 minutes for \nSenator Leahy and 5 minutes for Senator Coburn in relation to amendment \nNo. 1241. I further ask unanimous consent that the Senate then proceed \nto a vote in relation to amendment No. 1242, which is the Coburn-Boxer \namendment, on which we have already had debate, to be followed by a \nvote in relation to amendment No. 1241, which is the Coburn AID \namendment, on which we have already had debate, to be followed by a \nvote in relation to the Dorgan amendment related to TV Marti.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object, and I shall not object, \nshould we not have 2 minutes between each vote evenly divided between \nthe sides in the usual form to discuss the next vote?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I had not put that in the request. We \ncan\n\n[[Page S8466]]\n\ndo that. I so amend the unanimous-consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request as modified? \nWithout objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, will the Senator from North \nDakota yield for a question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am yielding on the time of the Senator \nfrom Florida. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask the Senator if we can see \nthat photograph of the airplane, the C-130. Would the Senator be more \namenable to this situation if he realized that the aircraft called \nCommando Solo has to fly all the way from Harrisburg, PA, to the \nFlorida Keys on Saturdays to do the broadcasts, and what the \nBroadcasting Board of Governors is proposing is instead to buy a small \naircraft that would be located in the Florida Keys so it would be close \nby and the broadcasts could be much more frequent? Would the Senator \nrecognize that might be a wise thing?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, since my colleague from Florida is going \nto oppose my amendment, I will not give him a lot of satisfaction with \nmy answer except to say this: Sending another airplane closer to Cuba \nto send signals that the Cubans cannot receive does little for the \nAmerican taxpayer, in my judgment.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, if I may, I would like to be heard on \nthe amendment. I rise to oppose the amendment because anytime someone \nwould offer an amendment that is going to deny the Cuban people the \nopportunity to hear the voices and see the signs of freedom, I do not \nbelieve that is an appropriate amendment, and I oppose it.\n  I want to correct a couple of misperceptions. The Senator from North \nDakota relishes showing the balloon photographs. I have heard him on \nseveral occasions discuss the unfortunate incident where apparently the \nwind blew it into the Everglades, which is inconsequential as to \nwhether, in fact, it reaches Cuba.\n  The fact is that technology began and the Cuban Government began to \njam it. The Cuban Government jams that information coming into the \nCuban people and the images of TV for some reason or another. It is \nobvious to them that it does harm to their political interests for the \npeople of Cuba to see these images of freedom. So I would discount the \nfact that because Cubans do choose to take that dangerous route of \ncoming through dangerous, treacherous waters, where more than one-third \nof them perish and die, and they do understand the difference between \nfreedom and tyranny, and out of desperation may come to this country, \nthat the information that they receive through the images of TV Marti \nare, in fact, remarkable and important.\n  I also say that while Radio Marti does reach Cuba, the quantum \nimportance of adding the images of television to those of radio are the \nsame impact of the reasons I would daresay that most of us who have run \nfor office in recent years choose to do television ads in preference \nover radio ads even though television ads are much more expensive, \nbecause the power of the images on the television set are much more \npowerful than those of the spoken word over the radio. That is why it \nis so important that not only Radio Marti but TV Marti also reach the \npeople of Cuba.\n  I add to that, even though it has been jammed by the Cuban \nGovernment, the Cuban Government has been unable to jam the flights of \nCommando Solo, which is why they are so important as an added measure \nof policy of the United States towards Cuba.\n  In fact, the Cuban people were able to see me take my oath of office \nas the first Cuban American in the history of this Nation to become a \nUnited States Senator from the very floor of this Senate with images of \nTV Marti broadcast to Cuba. So I would daresay that the information \nthat I receive anecdotally but certainly reliably is that the people of \nCuba do see the Commando Solo flights, do see the images reaching them \non television. The power of these images on television cannot be \nunderstated or minimized.\n  The fact is, the people of Cuba recently have suffered the ravages of \nyet another hurricane. As a result of that hurricane, it is \nunquestionable that the people of Cuba are desperate to know the facts \nof free information flow. For instance, the Cuban Government has \nrefused humanitarian aid from the U.S. Government. We hear that most of \nCuba today has blackouts given the fact that the hurricane destroyed \nlarge parts of the electrical system. Would it not be good to get the \ninformation to the people of Cuba that their dictator, their tyrant, \nwhile he sleeps in a comfortable, dry bed, does not want them to have \nthe humanitarian assistance that our Government would provide?\n  We know from reports that are received that the audio and video \nsignals are seen in the provinces of Havana, where more than one-third \nof the population of Cuba lives, also in Matanzas and Villa Clara \nprovinces. Villa Clara happens to be the part of the country where I \ncome from.\n  The fact is, the images in Cienfuegos, Pinar del Rio, Ciego de Avila, \nand Sancti Spiritus also have been seen and are seen frequently with \nthe assistance of the airplane which cannot be jammed.\n  Why would Castro, why would this dictator, why would this tyrant, jam \nthe signals that come into Cuba if it was of no significance to them \npolitically?\n  The policy towards Cuba changed on that day in the Rose Garden where \nI had the honor, by the President of the United States, to be appointed \nto a Cuba study commission, which I cochair with Secretary Powell. One \nof the important tenets of this policy toward Cuba was, in fact, to \ninclude information flow and to make it effective, which is why we \nshifted from the balloon to the airplane, a way in which the \ninformation could get to the people of Cuba.\n  I would finally say that the same arguments that are being made today \nagainst TV Marti are the same arguments as those that have been made \nagainst Radio Marti. The words that are being used on this Senate floor \nto further this amendment, the fact that the voices and sounds and \nsigns of freedom are given no importance, is a completely different \nmessage than that which we sent to the world when Radio Free Europe was \npiercing the Iron Curtain, when Radio Free Europe was beaming signs of \nhope and a better future to the people of Eastern Europe.\n  In talking to the Natan Sharansky and other heroes of those days, we \nknow that they value greatly the partnership and the solidarity with \nthe United States as they sought to stand up for freedom.\n  As the dissident movement in Cuba, each and every day growing, seeks \nto get a foothold and a toehold, the information from Radio and TV \nMarti is essential to the creation of voices of freedom, of people who \nlive on an imprisoned island without the ability to get information \nthat we today regard as casual and everyday, which is the evening news \nor the broadcast of any events that may take place in the world.\n  I yield time to my senior colleague, the Senator from Florida, so \nthat he might speak on this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, we have been through this only \na few weeks ago on another appropriations bill. This is the identical \namendment that was offered then. It was defeated by a very strong vote \nof 65 votes against it and 35 votes in favor of it.\n  Senator Dorgan, who is one of the fiscal watchdogs of this Chamber, \nis clearly well motivated in his attempt to find waste, but I want to \nlay out why I do not think this is a good place for him to look.\n  Cuba successfully jammed TV signals before, when we were beaming them \nfrom a tower located in the Keys or when we were beaming them off of \nthe ionosphere coming down where the Castro government could get a fix \non the signal. Likewise, they were successful in jamming it when they \ncould get a fix on a signal coming from a satellite. That is the reason \nthe airplane is so useful. They cannot get a fix on the signal because \nthe airplane is moving.\n  That is why I asked the Senator from North Dakota my question \nearlier: why is it not reasonable to think that we could save money, \nwhich is what the Broadcasting Board of Governors wants to do, instead \nof flying this C-130 all the way from Pennsylvania to off the\n\n[[Page S8467]]\n\ncoast of Cuba every Saturday? Let us have a smaller aircraft stationed \nnearby so that it can go more frequently and at much lower cost.\n  Is there any reason why Castro wants to jam the broadcast? He wants \nto keep the information from getting in, but the Cuban people are \nhungry for this information.\n  My position on this goes back to when I was 17 years old, when I was \nsent by this country as a representative of its youth to speak to young \npeople behind the Iron Curtain on Radio Free Europe. We know the \nsuccess of that program. We know that they tried to jam the broadcast, \nbut some broadcasts got through and were the lifeline for those people \nwho ultimately--we know the story. The Iron Curtain came down.\n  Eliminating this funding would eliminate the Broadcast Board of \nGovernors' radio and TV broadcast operations. With a dictator in Cuba \nwho is trying to keep his people's minds enslaved, as well as their \nbodies, this is not the time to end these broadcasts.\n  I hope our colleagues will defeat this amendment even more strongly \nthan they defeated the last one. Let us see how our broadcasts operate \nunder this new system. Let us see how, under the new leadership and \nadministration of Radio and TV Marti and all other forms of U.S. \noutreach and support to the island, this can demonstrate our commitment \nto the Cuban people and to all the oppressed people around the world.\n  If we were to end our support now we would be turning our backs on \nthe dissidents who have been so brave to sign the petition in the \nVarela project, a petition signed by over 11,000 courageous Cuban \ncitizens demanding greater freedoms. They made this petition in \naccordance with Cuban law, and yet were ignored by the Cuban \nGovernment.\n  So I urge our colleagues, on behalf of my colleague from Florida and \nthis Senator from Florida, to oppose this amendment.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida has 2 minutes 30 \nseconds remaining.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. In closing, I would like to say a couple of words about \nthe broader policy toward Cuba because I know that part of this has to \ndo with whether, in fact, we believe that the policy of this country \ntoward Cuba is misguided or actually correct.\n  The policy of this country toward Cuba has been enshrined in a study \nthat was carried out by Secretary Powell, myself, and others on behalf \nof President Bush to try to arrive at a consensus way in which we would \nlook at Cuban policy well beyond the fact of an embargo. An embargo had \nbeen in place for a long time, but that in and of itself did not \nconstitute a policy. The fact is, it was then a multifaceted approach \nthat was chosen. Included among those facets, one of the most important \nunderpinnings of it was the free information flow to the people of \nCuba. Radio and TV Marti are only one of the means in which it is done.\n  One has to understand this in the context of a society that is \nclosed, that does not permit people to seek information as casually as \nwe do today by going on the Internet. The Internet is denied to the \npeople of Cuba. Access to news and information is denied to the people \nof Cuba.\n  Cuba has always had the unfortunate circumstance of being an island, \nwhich has deprived it of communication and contact with other people in \nthe Western Hemisphere. As a result of that, the ease of information \ncontrol is greater there than it would be in many other places. That \nhas been a great detriment to the Cuban people in being unable to free \nthemselves from the shackles of oppression for now over 45 years.\n  Today we ought to defeat this amendment. We did so just a couple of \nweeks ago. This, again, is the same issue, the same time, the same \nmisguided look at the way in which we want to see the people of Cuba \nhave the opportunity for the free flow of information. So I urge my \ncolleagues to defeat this amendment and to, once again, allow the \npeople of Cuba to hear and see the voices and sounds of freedom, the \nvoices and sounds of liberty, as they seek to themselves regain that \nfor themselves.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes 35 seconds.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me just say that the case with respect \nto this country's dealing with Cuba is a case study in failure. I will \nnot debate that at the moment, but it is absolutely absurd. We plead \nthat the way to move China and Vietnam in a more constructive \ndirection, both Communist counties, is through trade and travel and \nengagement. We take exactly the opposite position with respect to Cuba. \nThis policy is the best friend Fidel Castro ever had, and that is why \nhe is still in office.\n  Aside from all of that, this amendment does not deal with the whole \nCuba trade policy. It deals with the issue of Fat Albert, and, yes, the \nnew airplane they want to buy. They say they are going to get a new \nlittle airplane, fly it off the coast of Florida, and we will get some \ntelevision signals into Cuba.\n  The fact is, they have already wasted $189 million. Apparently, now \nafter 10 years, or however many years it is, there is a new approach. I \ndon't believe it will work.\n  Let me read something from the Chicago Tribune Foreign Correspondent, \nOctober 2004. He went right to the heart of this. Do the Cubans see \nthese signals with Commando Solo or Fat Albert, the balloon? He says: \nIn interviews on the island, speaking of Cuba, it is difficult to find \nanyone who says they have ever seen TV Marti, although one Havana \nresident said she picked up some of the audio portion of a Saturday \nevening broadcast.\n  That viewer said: There was no picture but I could hear it and the \nstatic was very loud.\n  One person hearing a voice without a picture on a television station.\n  My colleague from Florida, Senator Martinez, said at the start of his \npresentation that Fidel Castro jams these signals. Yes, he does. That \nis exactly my point.\n  I am willing to do all kinds of things to send additional information \nto Cuba, to give them additional information, but I am not willing to \nsit by and say: Let's keep wasting money. If we send big fat balloons \nup in the air or send Commander Solo or buy a two-engine plane and run \nit off the coast of Florida and believe we are doing something, all we \nare doing is wasting the American taxpayers' money.\n  Maybe I am confused. Maybe I am just hopelessly confused and \nmisguided. I thought when you spend money that is not yours--and the \nmoney here is the taxpayers' money--I thought you should spend it \nwisely. When you find somebody wasting it, you stop it. Maybe I am \nconfused about that. I thought surely if all the evidence--I am talking \nabout the evidence of the people who ran this thing, TV Marti--if all \nthe evidence is you are sending television signals that no one can \nreceive and spending $189 million doing it, maybe at some point you \nwould stop and say this doesn't make any sense. This doesn't pass any \nlitmus test.\n  What I suggest is this: $21 million, once again, $21 million more to \nsend a television signal that no one can see. That $21 million is \nbetter spent by sending it to the Peace Corps, which is underfunded by \n$25 million. The Peace Corps is something of which I am enormously \nproud. It gives me great pride, these people moving around the world \nrepresenting our country in the Peace Corps in all corners of the \nworld. Underfunding $25 million to the Peace Corps and sticking $21 \nmillion into this? Maybe next time it will not be Commander Solo or an \naerostat balloon, or maybe they will train an eagle with some sort of \ntransmitter. Who knows? No matter what it is, no matter what the waste \nis, no matter they spend millions and millions--now $180 million--no \nmatter, there will be people here representing that waste.\n  Vote for this amendment. Move this money to the Peace Corps where it \nwill be used for the good of this country.\n  Have the yeas and nays been requested on my amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n\n[[Page S8468]]\n\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, am I correct we are now into a 10-\nminute debate on the Coburn amendment, or have we already had that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Five minutes is under the control of Senator Coburn \nand 5 minutes is under the control of Senator Leahy. Then, let me say \nfor my colleagues, we are unaware of any other amendments on either \nside that will require votes. We are also unaware that there will be a \nrequest for a recorded vote on final passage. So we are very close to \nthe end of consideration of the Foreign Operations bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1242\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, we are about to have a vote on the Coburn-\nBoxer amendment. It is a very straightforward amendment that says the \nU.S. Export-Import Bank should not subsidize a $5 billion loan for the \nsale of nuclear powerplants to China. We are opposed to it. I am \npersonally not opposed to nuclear power. I am not opposed to the \nChinese having nuclear power. But I am opposed to financing a company \nowned by the British Government through the British Nuclear Fuels \nCompany, which is wholly owned by the British Government, which wholly \nowns Westinghouse Nuclear Powerplant Division. This Export-Import Bank \nfinancing will also finance Mitsubishi Steel out of Japan.\n  The question that has been raised in the debate is if we don't do it, \nthe French or Russians will. The fact is, if we have the best \ntechnology and the best quality, then we ought to earn it on the \nmerits. The American taxpayers should not be put on the hook for \nfinancing.\n  The second issue is that when we buy business in this country--which \nis what we are doing; we are buying business by subsidizing and giving \na deal to compete--what we are doing is taking away moneys and Export-\nImport financing that could be used elsewhere. This is by far the \nlargest, by 250 percent, of any Export-Import Bank loan in the history \nof the Export-Import Bank. I don't believe our grandchildren should be \non the hook for it, but I also don't believe this is the best use of \nthat money.\n  I am an advocate of nuclear power both in this country and around the \nworld. I think it can be used safely. These are great companies, but it \nis time we get out of the idea of buying business and out of the idea \nof putting our kids and our grandkids at risk for something that fully \nshould be subsidized by the governments that are going to benefit the \nmost from it.\n\n  I yield my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, yesterday on the floor I suggested that I \nmight offer an amendment to this bill dealing with the CNOOC Chinese \noil company's purchase of Unocal. I wanted to tell the ranking member \nthat I decided not to offer this amendment to this appropriations \nsubcommittee bill. There are other avenues with which to discuss and \ndescribe that issue. It is very controversial. It is something which I \nbelieve very strongly the Congress--the Senate needs to deal with, but \nI have elected not to do it on this particular piece of legislation \nbecause other opportunities will exist in the days ahead.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Senator from North Dakota. Then, as the \nSenator from Kentucky said earlier, I think it is pretty clear we on \nour side do not have any amendments beyond the unanimous-consent \nagreement that would require rollcall votes. I know of nobody on this \nside, nor am I, requesting a rollcall vote on final passage, insofar as \nwe are going to have to have a rollcall vote when the conference report \ncomes back, in any event.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1241\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes on the Coburn \namendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I have spent almost 30 years on this committee, cutting \nout areas where I believed we spent tax dollars frivolously. This, \nhowever, is talking about $5,000 overall throughout AID regarding \nhospitality for visiting dignitaries. I have had disagreements with \nvarious Directors of AID over the years on particular programs, but I \nam not going to come on the Senate floor and seek to micromanage AID to \nthe extent that if they have visiting dignitaries and they are trying \nto move through a program, they would be unable to even have recorded \nmusic for that or pay a modest honorarium to a local singer or \nsomething like that to come in and entertain, much the same way other \ncountries do with us. We are talking about for the whole world--$5,000 \nin a multimillion dollar budget.\n  Frankly, I will give the Bush administration--as I have since I have \nbeen in the Senate the Ford administration, the Reagan administration, \nthe first Bush administration, the Clinton administration, and now the \nBush administration--the benefit of the doubt that out of this \nmultibillion dollar budget, they can handle this $5,000.\n  I will vote against the amendment, and I yield the remainder of my \ntime.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1242\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Coburn \namendment, numbered 1242.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Do we now have rollcall votes on all three stacked \namendments? Have they been requested of all three?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, further parliamentary inquiry: Is it the \nintent of the distinguished Republican leader to request subsequent \nvotes after this first one be 10-minute votes?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that the second and third \nvotes on the three stacked amendments be 10-minute rollcall votes, and \nas was suggested earlier, there will be a minute on each side to \ndescribe each of the amendments prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. \nThe yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Louisiana (Ms. Landrieu) \nis necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thune). Is there any Senator in the \nChamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 37, nays 62, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 192 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--37\n\n     Allard\n     Bayh\n     Boxer\n     Brownback\n     Byrd\n     Clinton\n     Coburn\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Dayton\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Gregg\n     Harkin\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Martinez\n     Mikulski\n     Obama\n     Reed\n     Salazar\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Stabenow\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--62\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Burr\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Cornyn\n     Corzine\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Feinstein\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Isakson\n     Jeffords\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Lautenberg\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Santorum\n     Shelby\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Landrieu\n       \n  The amendment (No. 1242) was rejected.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1241\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided on the Coburn amendment No. 1241.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, the claim is that this is micromanagement\n\n[[Page S8469]]\n\nof USAID. USAID's role is to deliver goods, health care, and support to \nthe needy people around the world. What this amendment does is negate \nwhat they have already said they are going to ignore anyway. I will \nread: USAID has the authority to use program and regular operating \nexpense funds for entertainment under the necessary expense doctrine. \nGAO decisions to the contrary are not binding on this Agency.\n  This is a small amount of money, but it should send a signal to \nUSAID, their job is to deliver what we want as American taxpayers in \nterms of health care and food and medicine to people in need. The best \nexample of that is not to spend the money on furnishings, not on live \nrecording artists, not on gifts for other bureaucrats but on food and \nmedicine for those people who need it. That is what this amendment is \nabout. It is not about micromanaging. It is about sending a signal: Do \nwhat you are expected to do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have had questions about what six \ndifferent administrations have done, since I have been in the Senate, \nin their operation of USAID, but I have never seen such \nmicromanagement. This would could cost far more than it would save. It \nwould actually cost far more money than this amount in debating it. It \nwould not have been done in the Ford administration, the Nixon \nadministration, the Reagan administration, the former Bush \nadministration, the Clinton administration, and I would not support \nthis kind of micromanagement in the current Bush administration. We \nwould simply spend more money debating it than we could save, and I \nhope we would vote against it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.

There will now be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided on the Dorgan amendment No. 1294.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we have now spent $198 million sending \ntelevision signals to Cuba that the Cubans cannot see. It is called \nTelevision Marti. The President proposes to spend another $21 million \nin the coming year, including buying an airplane to send these signals. \nLet me say that the Chicago Tribune foreign correspondent recently \nreported on this and said he couldn't find anybody who had ever seen TV \nMarti. In all of the surveys that have been done on people who came \nover by raft and so on, they couldn't find anybody who saw TV Marti. \nWhy? Because it was jammed. So we are spending another $21 million in \nthe next year to send television signals the Cubans can't see. \nMeanwhile, we have now cut $25 million in this bill from the \nPresident's budget request for the Peace Corps. I say let's take the \n$21 million we now spend on television signals the Cubans can't watch \nand spend it on the Peace Corps which will invest in the future of this \ncountry and promote a better world.\n  I don't think I need to say much more about this. I could speak about \nFat Albert and Commando Solo and the aerostat balloon, but I shall not \ndo that at the moment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, a few weeks ago this same amendment was \ndefeated in the Senate by a large majority. I urge my colleagues once \nagain to defeat this bad amendment. The fact is, the people of Cuba \nhave had these signals jammed by the Cuban Government because the Cuban \nGovernment places such a high value on controlling information and \nbecause it places such a high value on controlling how the people of \nCuba think. With the addition of airplane flights, we have now been \nable to get the signal to the Cuban people because the signal is not in \none fixed point. It can move about. As it moves about, the people in \nCuba can, in fact, receive the signal and did, in fact, see me take my \noath of office on the Senate floor. As the first Cuban American in this \nSenate, it was a historic moment for the people of Cuba, and it was an \nexciting thing for them to see.\n  These are the kinds of voices and visual images that are encouraging \nthe dissident movement within Cuba that is increasingly becoming more \nknown and better known by the people of Cuba through the signals and \nthe radio transmissions of Radio and TV Marti.\n  I urge my colleagues to join with me and my colleague from Florida, \nSenator Nelson, in defeating the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me announce to all of our \ncolleagues, this will be the last vote tonight. We are unable to finish \nthe bill tonight. We will have to wrap it up tomorrow. But this is the \nlast rollcall vote tonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1260 and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Santorum], for himself \n     and Mr. Durbin, proposes an amendment numbered 1260.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To transfer $100,000,000 from the Economic Support Fund to \n  provide for an additional contribution to the Global Fund to Fight \n                    AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria)\n\n       On page 326, between lines 10 and 11, insert the following:\n\n\n                           TRANSFER OF FUNDS\n\n       Sec. 6113. Of the funds appropriated in title III for Other \n     Bilateral Economic Assistance under the heading ``economic \n     support fund'', $100,000,000 shall be transferred to and \n     merged with funds made available in title III for the United \n     States Agency for International Development for a United \n     States contribution to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, \n     Tuberculosis and Malaria under the heading ``child survival \n     and health programs fund. The funds made available for \n     contribution to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis \n     and Malaria in this section shall not be available for \n     obligation prior to September 30, 2006.''.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I thank the managers of this bill for \nagreeing to accept this amendment. We have been working diligently over \nthe last few days to make sure this amendment could become part of the \nbill. Senator McConnell, in particular, has been exceptionally helpful \nin allowing this amendment to be entered into the managers' package, \nwhich I am told the Senator will be offering.\n  It is an amendment Senator Durbin and I have been working on to add \n$100 million to the Global Fund for HIV/AIDS. It is an important $100 \nmillion in that it brings the U.S. contribution up to the level of one-\nthird the amount that is estimated to be contributed to the Global \nFund.\n  A few years ago, we passed a piece of legislation on the floor of the \nSenate that the President signed into law that said that we would \nprovide $1 for every $2 of international contributions to the Global \nFund to help fight this scourge that is killing 270,000 people a \nmonth--a month--on the continent of Africa. It is just remarkable. The \nnumber is almost too much for all of us to comprehend, the devastation \noccurring on the continent of Africa.\n  Senator Durbin and I have in the past worked together on a bipartisan \nbasis to try to provide the money to the Global Fund as an incentive \nfor other countries to make their contribution and to up their \ncontributions. So this $100 million puts the marker out there, that \nthose in the international community believe is the right marker for \nwhere they believe the international community will come in with \ncontributions.\n  It is keeping the American commitment. It is a commitment the \nPresident of the United States, as recently as the G8 summit, says he \nbelieves we should, in fact, keep a 1-to-2 ratio of funds for the \nGlobal Fund.\n  This money is being used effectively. We are not only using the \nGlobal Fund effectively, but our bilateral aid, for which the President \nrequested $3 billion, is being used effectively to treat hundreds of \nthousands of people with antiretroviral drugs, as well as treatment for \nmalaria and tuberculosis, not just in Africa, but the Global Fund \nreaches beyond the continent of Africa into other countries where there \nis a rapid increase in the infection of HIV/AIDS.\n  This is a vitally important amendment to keep our commitment, to keep \nthe pressure on the international community to come up with the money \nnecessary to help fight this pandemic in Africa and in many other \ncountries around the world.\n  It is an opportunity for the Senate to go into conference with the \nHouse with a stronger number, with the right number, and hold that \nnumber. The way we have offset this--again, we had a lot of cooperation \nfrom Senator McConnell and Senator Gregg on the Budget Committee. We \nunderstand we are going to have to work on it in conference to make \nsure the offset squares a little better than what we actually have in \nthis amendment. We are willing to work with the managers, as well as \nthe chairman of the Budget Committee, to make sure we do this in a way \nthat will meet with their satisfaction.\n  But we have laid down the marker tonight. This amendment is going to \nbe adopted. We are going to be at $3 billion in bilateral aid and $600 \nmillion for the Global Fund, so the total U.S. commitment is going to \nbe $3.6 billion--$500 million with this amendment, and Senator Specter, \nin the Labor-HHS appropriations bill, has an additional $100 million, \nwhich brings the total to $600 million, as I said before.\n  This is a very gratifying day, I know, for Senator Durbin. I \nappreciate his support and the support of all the Members on the \nDemocratic side of the aisle who have been stalwart supporters of the \nGlobal Fund and making sure that America keeps its commitment it has \nmade to those who are suffering from this pandemic around the world.\n  Mr. President, I thank again the Senator from Kentucky, the manager \nof this bill, for his tremendous cooperation. I thank all those who \nhave worked very hard, all the outside groups who have been lobbying \nMembers of Congress in the House and Senate and spending a lot of \nenergy on this issue trying to get to this number, $3.6 billion, with \n$600 million in the Global Fund. That has been the target for this \nyear. With the adoption of this amendment, all of that work has at \nleast taken one big step in the right direction. Now our job is to make \nsure we hold this number in conference so we can do what is right for \nthe people who are affected with this pandemic around the world.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the Santorum-Durbin \nglobal AIDS amendment, which addresses the deadliest epidemic in modern \ntimes.\n  The amendment before us presents a simple choice: fighting AIDS, or \nfunding cost overruns. Providing lifesaving treatment for tens of \nthousands of the most vulnerable people in the world, or allocating \nscarce funds for excess, and perhaps questionable, reconstruction costs \nin Iraq.\n  A number of my colleagues and I have argued on the floor of this \nChamber that budgets are moral documents, that budgets are about \nchoices.\n  If budgets are moral documents, then appropriations bills are where \nour moral principles are put into practice. Appropriations bills are \nwhere we decide, line by line, where the people's money will be spent.\n  The choice before us is simple: we cannot place cost overruns ahead \nof lifesaving treatment.\n  AIDS is the deadliest pandemic of our times, killing 3 million people \nevery year. That is one person ever 10 seconds.\n  AIDS kills individuals, impoverishes families, orphans children, \nimperils economics, destabilizes societies, and steals hope.\n  This disease can undermine the stability and economies of nations, to \nsuch a degree that the CIA has called HIV/AIDS a threat to our national \nsecurity.\n  Dr. Condoleezza Rice, while National Security Adviser, said that \n``fighting the scourge of HIV/AIDS is both a moral duty and a strategy \npriority.''\n  I would like to commend the Appropriations Committee, which has \ndemonstrated their strong commitment to fighting HIV/AIDS around the \nworld. The bill before us fully funds the President's request for \nbilateral HIV/AIDS programs. It also provides $400 million for the \nglobal fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. When combined \nwith the $100 million provided to\n\n[[Page S8471]]\n\nthe global fund in the Labor-HHS appropriations bill, the total U.S. \ncontribution for fiscal year 2006 to the global fund will be $500 \nmillion.\n  This is a good start, but it leaves us $100 million short of what the \nglobal fund needs to simply renew existing programs and ensure that \npeople receiving lifesaving treatment will not lose their access to \ncare. Making sure that no one loses their access to care is the moral \nminimum that we as a nation must meet.\n  The global fund is an important complement to our bilateral programs. \nIt supports projects in 130 countries, complementing the bilateral \nprogram's efforts in 15 focus countries.  The fund tackles tuberculosis \nand malaria, which together kill 3 million people a year, along with \nHIV/AIDS.\n  The global fund also provides a unique opportunity for American \nleadership to directly result in increased contributions from others. \nThe bill that created the President's emergency plan for AIDS relief \nestablished an important benchmark for the global fund. For every \ndollar that we put in, we asked other donors to put in $2. This has \nhelped to make the global fund a truly global effort, by encouraging \nother countries to step up their contributions to the fund. In response \nto the fund's needs, Japan recently tripled its donation to the fund, \nand France doubled its donations. The United States should also put in \nits share. I believe strongly that no one should lose their access to \nlifesaving treatment because the United States didn't come up with its \nshare of the needed funds.\n  I have met a number of the individuals whose lives are being saved by \nglobal fund programs. I have met their young children and listened to \ntheir hopes for the future. I can't imagine that anyone in this Chamber \nwould wish to cut off lifesaving care to any of these individuals. This \nis why our amendment provides an additional $100 million for the fund.\n  To offset the $100 million increase for the global fund, the \nSantorum-Durbin amendment reduces funding to Iraq programs in the \necomomic support fund by $100 million. The Senate Appropriations \nCommittee provided the full requested level of $3 billion for the \neconomic support fund, including $360 million in new money for Iraq \nprograms. However, Congress has already provided over $18 billion for \nIraq relief and reconstruction programs in supplemental appropriations. \nNearly $12 billion of these funds remain unspent, including nearly $5 \nbillion that have not even been obligated.\n  A very small portion of this nearly $5 billion in unobligated funds \ncould be used to make up for our proposed reduction of $100 million to \nthe economic support fund.\n  I would like to be clear that I strongly support the rebuilding and \nreconstruction efforts in Iraq. Reconstruction is vitally important for \nthe people of Iraq, for stability in the Middle East, and for the \nspread of democracy around the globe.\n  But, it is also clear that there is more money currently available \nfor Iraq reconstruction than is being used. Over 18 months after \nCongress appropriated over $18 billion for reconstruction, nearly $5 \nbillion remains unobligated.\n  Moreover, according to the White House, there is $1.3 billion that \nhas not even been committed to programs. This $1.3 billion is instead \nintended for ``security-related cost overruns.'' This means that 7 \npercent of the total amount Congress appropriated for reconstruction is \nbeing reserved for ``cost-overruns.''\n  If cost overruns are preventing the use of reconstruction dollars for \ntheir intended purpose, Congress should be hearing about this so we can \nwork with the administration to get these expenditures under control.\n  If the nearly $5 billion in unobligated funds is not adequate to make \nup the $100 million reduction imposed by our amendment and additional \nfunds are determined to be needed, I would support replenishment of \nthese funds in future appropriations bills.\n  I have voted for every penny for our troops, and I am committed to \nIraqi reconstruction as part of our mission in Iraq. But if $5 billion \nis still unobligated, including $1.3 billion intended for ``cost \noverruns,'' then I believe that $100 million of these funds could be \nbetter served for another vital mission: saving lives.\n  President Bush has described AIDS as ``an individual tragedy for all \nwho suffer and a public health catastrophe that threatens the future of \nmany nations.''\n  And, Dr. Rice, while National Security Adviser, warned, ``History \nwill treat us unkindly if those of us who had the means and those of us \nwho had the way were unresponsive to this great crisis.''\n  We have the ability today to literally save the lives of millions. \nThis $100 million can provide antiretroviral treatment to 35,000 \npeople, and provide over 2 million mosquito nets to keep children safe \nfrom malaria.\n  This is why I support an additional $100 million contribution to the \nglobal fund. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, no one has been more tenacious in \nfighting for adequate funding for HIV/AIDS than the Senator from \nPennsylvania. I thank him for his important contribution.\n  His amendment is such a good idea that it has been approved on both \nsides of the aisle. Mr. President, I recommend we move forward and \napprove the amendment on a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1260) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 1250 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that amendment \nNo. 1250 be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1290\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1290, as it has \nbeen cleared on both sides, and ask that we adopt it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n  Is there further debate? If not, without objection, the amendment is \nagreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1290) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am a cosponsor of this amendment to \nprovide $50 million in assistance for the African Union in Darfur, \nSudan. The African Union is today our only line of defense against \ngenocide in Darfur. As the President restated at the G8 meeting earlier \nthis month, what is happening in Darfur is genocide. And, as he said, \nthe human cost is beyond calculation.\n  The African Union has struggled to raise the numbers of peacekeeping \ntroops needed in Darfur, but it has nonetheless made a difference. The \nAU has saved lives, but it has not been able to create conditions of \nsecurity. To make a greater difference, it will have to increase the \nnumber of troops on the ground.\n  This amendment earmarks $50 million from the newly drafted Conflict \nResponse Fund to the Foreign Military Finance Account for the African \nUnion mission in Darfur.\n  The administration has asked for a Conflict Response Fund to respond \nto conflicts that may emerge in the next year. The conflict in Darfur \nhas already emerged. It must be addressed.\n  And the State Department has said that it needs at least $100 million \nto support the expansion of the African Union mission. This amendment \nat least gets us halfway there.\n  You might ask why the administration didn't ask for this money for \nthe African Union directly. Apparently when the budget request was \nformulated, they did not think that the AU mission would have to be \nscaled up still further. Evidence on the ground tells us that expanding \nthe mission is a necessity, and so is the additional funding.\n  This spring, the Joint Assessment Team of the EU, the U.N., the AU, \nand\n\n[[Page S8472]]\n\nthe U.S. conducted assessment of the AU's Darfur mission.\n  The assessment found that where the current AU mission has deployed, \nthe security situation has improved. The Joint Assessment Team also \nfound that the general security level remains unacceptable. That is \nstill true today.\n  The Joint Assessment report concluded that the African Union mission \nshould be doubled by September, followed by a subsequent expansion ``to \ncontribute to a secure environment throughout Darfur in order to enable \nfull returns of displaced persons.''\n  To accomplish this task--even to undertake it--will require \nadditional assistance from the United States. The AU is on the front \nlines against genocide. We have to help.\n  There are those who think that the crisis in Darfur is over because \ntoday the villages in the region are no longer on fire.\n  Sadly, the fires are out, not because the Sudanese Government has \nnecessarily changed its policies, but because so many villages have \nalready been burned to the ground.\n  Darfur is still the scene of terrible violence and terrible fear.\n  There are still hundreds of thousands, even millions of people who \nare living in displacement camps in Sudan or in refugee camps outside \nits borders. And these people are still under attack. Women and girls \nare still at risk of rape every time they go to collect firewood or \nwater.\n  People are still being killed. Children, especially, are still dying \nfrom the diseases that plague refugee camps.\n  If the African Union cannot create conditions of greater security, \nthese people cannot go home. If the AU cannot create conditions of \nsafety, these people will not go home.\n  Right now, they would rather risk the misery, the disease, and the \ndanger of the camps than go home and risk facing the jingaweit and the \nSudanese army.\n  The violence, food insecurity, and enormous numbers of displaced \npersons combine to make Darfur still one of the most desperate places \non the planet. This is not yesterday's tragedy.\n  Over 2 million people have been driven from their homes. Over 300,000 \nhave probably been killed, maybe even more.

Mr. President, this amendment provides $28 million for \nthe International Republican Institute and $28 million for the National \nDemocratic Institute for their democracy-building programs in Iraq in \nfiscal year 2006. Funding will be used by the institutes to continue \ndemocratic development assistance in the areas of governance, \nelections, civil society, women's rights and political party \ndevelopment.\n  The additional funding set aside in this bipartisan democracy \namendment is necessary for the IRI and NDI to continue their important \nwork in Iraq through the end of fiscal year 2006.\n  Both institutes, whose cutting-edge democracy work is well-known and \nrespected in Iraq and throughout the world, have substantial operations \nin Iraq outside the Green Zone. Unfortunately, despite their deep \ncommitment to advancing democracy and the great risks their employees \ntake by working in a war zone, they have not been assured funding \nbeyond February 2006. If additional funding is not provided, the danger \nis very real that they will need to begin cutting back on their \ndemocracy activities.\n  Under the current schedule, the new Iraqi Constitution now being \ndrafted must be completed by August 15, and a referendum on it will \ntake place on October 15. If it is approved, elections for a permanent \ngovernment will take place in December. This is no time to short change \ndemocracy in Iraq. Doing so would send a very troubling and \ndiscouraging sign about the U.S. commitment to this difficult struggle.\n  IRI's programs in Iraq are bigger than its programs anywhere else in \nthe world. It has offices in Baghdad, Irbil, and Basra, and it also \noperates a substantial media center. The Institute employs some 200 \npeople, including those responsible for security.\n  Similarly, NDI is conducting a number of democracy programs in Iraq \nfocusing on elections, political parties, governance, civil society and \nwomen's rights. It works directly with Iraqi partners, including \nhundreds of civic organizations, the Iraqi National Assembly, more than \n81 political parties and entities, and the Constitutional Drafting \nCommittee.\n  It has helped train more than 10,000 Iraqi election monitors, who \ncovered 80 percent of the country's polling sites in January and \nprovided opportunities for ordinary Iraqis to participate in that \nelection. It is currently providing legal assistance directly to the \nConstitutional Drafting Committee, and is facilitating countless local \ncivic dialogues on the constitution in communities throughout Iraq.\n  NDI operates much of the time outside the relative safety of the \nGreen Zone. It has offices in Baghdad, Basra, and Irbil, with resource \ncenters in Hilla and Kirkuk. It works with approximately 30 \ninternational staff and 200 Iraqi staff, including security personnel, \nto strengthen democracy for all the people of Iraq.\n  Its people have sacrificed greatly. In February, insurgents killed an \nIraqi woman working for NDI, and a Czech security guard working for the \ninstitute was killed in April. Three of NDI's Iraqi staff left their \njobs because they felt their lives were in danger.\n  While Iraq continues to struggle with the insurgency, there is \nimportant\n\n[[Page S8474]]\n\nprogress to be made on the political front. Thousands of Iraqis are \nworking very hard, often at great risk to themselves, to develop civic \ngroups, participate in political parties, run for and serve in \npolitical office, and contribute to the constitutional process. These \nare critical building blocks for the long-term development of democracy \nin Iraq. Its people continue to express a tremendous demand for the \nkind of nonpartisan assistance for long-term political development that \nNDI and IRI are providing.\n  All of us feel that long-term progress to defeat the insurgency is \ndirectly related to progress on the political front, and ongoing work \non this key issue must be a top priority. History shows that building \ndemocratic institutions, including government, parties, and civil \nsociety, takes many years, considerable political engagement, and \npatience. For a country as repressed as Iraq, a serious long-term \ndemocracy plan must look at least a decade into the future. At a \nminimum, it should look to the end of fiscal year 2006, as our \namendment would do.\n  The development of the constitution and the subsequent referendum and \nelection are only the beginning of that process. It makes no sense to \nsend a signal now that our support for Iraqi democracy will end next \nFebruary.\n  We must be clear in our intention to stand by organizations such as \nNDI and IRI that are working on the front lines in the struggle for \ndemocracy in Iraq every day. We also need to demonstrate to Iraqis and \nothers that we are committed to Iraq's long-term democratic \ndevelopment. We need a long-term plan and a long-term strategy that is \nbacked by appropriate resources.\n  To date, approximately $1 billion of the $18 billion provided by \nCongress for reconstruction has been allocated for democracy-building \nand related activities, including governance, the rule of law, human \nrights, civic programs, and the U.S. Institute of Peace. Nearly all of \nthese funds have already been committed for specific programs and more \nthan half of this amount has been spent.\n  We need to do far more. The hard work of strengthening democracy will \ncontinue long after the adoption of a constitution and the election of \na permanent government.\n  On June 28, in his address to the Nation, President Bush spoke about \nthe importance of democracy in Iraq as a way to quell the insurgency \nand end the violence. He said:\n\n       They know that as freedom takes root in Iraq, it will \n     inspire millions across the Middle East to claim their \n     liberty, as well. And when the Middle East grows in democracy \n     and prosperity and hope, the terrorists will lose their \n     sponsors, lose their recruits, and lose their hopes for \n     turning that region into a base for attacks on America and \n     our allies around the world.\n\n  Our financial commitment to the organizations at the forefront of the \ndemocracy effort must be strong and unambiguous. Funding IRI and NDl \nonly through February 2006 sends an ominous signal that can only be \nharmful to this very important effort.\n  America spends $1 billion a week on the war in Iraq. At this rate, it \nwould take the military just 10 hours to spend the $60 million. \nCertainly, we can make a commitment to spend this level of funding on \ndemocracy programs next year in Iraq.\n  Regardless of whether we supported or opposed the war, we all agree \nthat the work of building democracy requires patience, skill and, \nimportantly, adequate resources.\n  We need to demonstrate we are genuinely committed to Iraq's political \ndevelopment. We need a long-term political strategy, and we need to \nback up that strategy with the necessary resources, if we truly hope \nfor a stable, peaceful and democratic Iraq.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing amendments be the only remaining first-degree amendments in \norder to the bill: Feingold amendment on oversight of funds; Chambliss \namendment on extradition; Landrieu amendment on orphans; Schumer, \nreporting requirement; Frist, two relevant; McConnell, relevant; Leahy, \nrelevant; Byrd, relevant; Lugar, MDB reform; Lugar, general provision; \nReid, Iraq report; Reid, two relevant; Nelson of Florida, Haiti report; \nDodd, Haiti report, Biden Nos. 1251 and 1252; Biden, nonproliferation.\n  I further ask consent that they be subject to second degrees which \nare related to the first degree to which they are offered. I further \nask consent that following the disposition of the above-listed \namendments, the bill be read a third time and the Senate proceed to a \nvote on the passage of the bill, as amended; provided further that \nfollowing the vote, the Senate insist on its amendment, request a \nconference with the House, and the Chair be authorized to appoint \nconferees on the part of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the pending Department of State, Foreign \nOperations and Related Programs Appropriations Bill for fiscal year \n2006, H.R. 3057, as reported by the Senate Committee on Appropriations \nprovides $31.842 billion in budget authority and $34.998 billion in \noutlays in fiscal year 2006 for the Department of State and foreign \nassistance programs. Of these totals, $174 million in budget authority \nand outlays are for mandatory programs in fiscal year 2006.\n  The bill provides total discretionary budget authority in fiscal year \n2006 of $31.668 billion. This amount is $1 billion below the \nPresident's request, $3 million below the 302(b) allocations adopted by \nthe Senate $11.4 billion more than the House-passed bill, and $3.2 \nbillion above fiscal year 2005 enacted levels.\n  I commend the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee \nfor bringing this legislation before the Senate.

Totals adjusted for consistency with scorekeeping\n  conventions.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I support passage of the Foreign \nOperations Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2006. This important \nlegislation funds the international development and assistance portion \nof our national budget and with its passage, we acknowledge the vital \nnature of these programs. Supporting foreign aid, military assistance, \ndevelopment funds, democracy promotion activities and other programs \nshould be a matter of course--something that America does as part of \nits responsibilities as the global superpower.\n  This year's bill provides $31.8 billion to carry out our many fore \noperations programs. I commend Senator McConnell, chairman of the \nforeign operations subcommittee, and Senator Leahy, ranking member of \nthe subcommittee, on developing an appropriations measure that is \ngenerally light on pork. There are, nevertheless, dozens of earmarks, \nespecially in the report language, including a few that simply leave me \nscratching my head. I am a longstanding champion of robust funding of \nAmerica's international affairs budget. But I ask, whether that budget \nshould include an earmark of half a million dollars for the Neotropical \nRaptor Center in Panama. I wonder if the birds of prey the center seeks \nto protect have instead descended on our appropriations bill. Likewise, \nthe report includes a $2 million earmark for ``activities to protect \nthe orangutan from extinction'' and directs that some of these funds go \nto the Orangutan Foundation.\n  I note with regret that, once again, the Senate has failed to pass an \nauthorization bill prior to considering this legislation. Again, the \nresponsibilities of authorizors and appropriators are expected to be \ndistinct. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee has the responsibility \nfor laying out a blueprint for the policies and funding levels of USAID \nand the Department of State and their programs. I hope that the Senate \nwill finish consideration of the State Department authorization bill, \nso that the Senate will have the benefit of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee's recommendations. We should not continue to fund \nunauthorized programs and risk marginalizing our authorizing \ncommittees.\n  With that said, most of the provisions in the bill under \nconsideration serve America's interests and values in powerful ways. \nLet me comment on just one group. This year's version of the Foreign \nOperations bill states that $495 million of our annual aid to Egypt \n``shall be provided with the understanding that Egypt will undertake \nsignificant economic political reforms which are additional to those \nwhich were undertaken in previous fiscal years.'' The bill also \nwithholds $227 million in economic reform assistance until the \nSecretary of State determines that the Government of Egypt has met its \n2005 economic reform commitments--commitments it made to the United \nStates. Finally, the bill directs that nongovernmental organizations \nproviding democracy and governance assistance shall not be subject to \nprior approval by Government of Egypt. I believe that we should have \nconditioned aid to Egypt in this way for years, and I commend my \ncolleagues on the Appropriations Committee for these bold steps. The \nGovernment of Egypt has, for too long, gotten a free pass from the \nUnited States. We are grateful for its friendship with the U.S. and its \npeace agreement with Israel, but its lack of real reform offends the \nuniversal values we hold dear and poses a security threat to the United \nStates.\n  I would also like to note that the report language contains words of \nsupport for the ADVANCE Democracy Act. Working with Senator Lieberman \nand the other cosponsors of the ADVANCE Democracy Act, I will continue \nwork toward passage of that bill this year, and I thank my colleagues \non the Appropriations Committee for their support. I hope that we can \nwork together to move the ADVANCE bill through the Senate in the near \nfuture.\n  I must once again convey my gratitude to the members of the \nsubcommittee. Their attention and commitment to supporting vital \nprograms has provided a sound bill with which to fund our foreign \noperations for the coming fiscal year.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, somewhere in the world a child dies from \nmalaria every 30 seconds. The disease debilitates more than 500 million \npeople annually and kills well over 1 million of them. Suffering most \nacutely from this epidemic is the continent of Africa where 90 percent \nof the world's malaria deaths occur. In fact, malaria is the No. 1 \nkiller of pregnant women and children under the age of 5 in Africa.\n  I have personally visited nearly 20 countries in Africa. Everywhere \nyou go there, children have it. These trips have changed statistics \ninto incomprehensible reality for me. Malaria--a debilitating and \ndeadly disease--is a huge problem. I recently heard from a young boy in \nGhana named Ibrahim who has accepted the dismal reality of dealing with \nmalaria. ``Malaria is just a part of life,'' Ibrahim told me.\n  The United States has been concerned about this problem for many \nyears. The United States Agency for International Development, USAID, \nbudget to fight this disease has increased nearly fivefold since 1998 \nto $90 million in 2005. However, the incidence of malaria continues to \nincrease alarmingly in underdeveloped African countries. Unequivocally, \nthe current strategy is not working. USAID spends 90 percent of its \nmoney on advice giving, conferences, and technical assistance, but not \non direct interventions that produce significant results.\n  Insecticides to preempt malaria are cheap. Drugs to cure malaria can \nbe purchased for $2--less than a cup of coffee at Starbucks. Indoor \nresidual spraying is a technique that has eradicated malaria in many \nregions. We know how to address malaria and we have the resources to do \nit.\n  We have talked enough about the problem. It is time to fix it.\n  I am pleased that we have addressed this problem with language in the \nForeign Operations appropriations bill. This is an important step \ntoward achieving real results. Instead of doling out money to beltway-\nbased consultants, this language will ensure that tangible aid reaches \ndesperate African women and children. It is vital that we require USAID \nmalaria allocations go toward lifesaving drugs, mosquito nets, and \npesticides, which are proven to reduce malaria death and infection \nrates. In the hands of the affected individuals these commodities can \nsave lives. It does not take a lot of money to make a huge difference.\n  Additionally, this language requires transparency from USAID. I have \noften had difficulty determining exactly how USAID malaria money is \nbeing spent. In fact, the latest data available to Congress on how \nUSAID spends malaria funding is from fiscal year 2004.\n\n[[Page S8476]]\n\nThat year only 1 percent of total malaria funding was spent on indoor \nresidual spraying, 1 percent was spent on purchasing antimalarial \ndrugs, and 6 percent was used to purchase insecticide-treated bed nets.\n  I am also concerned that too much of our foreign aid goes to \nconferences and research. Not enough resources get directly to the \nAfricans who suffer so acutely. No more studies. It is time to act and \nto prevent that aid from being diverted to Washington consultants.\n  To effectively address this epidemic, Congress needs to ensure that \nthe money it appropriates is wisely spent. Within 90 days of enactment, \nthis language requires USAID to submit their malaria expenditure report \nto the Senate and House Appropriations Committees to describe how they \nplan to follow these new priorities. I am confident that this increased \naccountability will prevent funds from going primarily primarily to \nbeltway-based consultants.\n  When we know how to eradicate malaria and possess the resources to do \nthat, there is no reason that six children should have died in the time \nit took me to give this speech. It is a needless tragedy that we have \nthe opportunity to arrest.\n  Children in Africa have accepted the reality that malaria is \ninevitable. Today, we have the chance to change that dismal reality \ninto tangible hope.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/19/senate-section/article/S8476-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8476]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, it has now been 1 week since the \nPresident met with Senate leadership and the chairman and and ranking \nDemocrat of the Senate Judiciary Committee to discuss the nomination of \na successor for Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.\n  All of us were saddened by Justice O'Connor's resignation. She served \nthis Nation with great dedication for over 2 decades. She embodied the \nprinciples of fairness and reasoned judgment, and had a sincere \nappreciation for the effect of the Court's decisions on the everyday \nlives of all American people. Her dedication continues in her pledge to \nremain in office as long as it is necessary for her replacement to be \nconfirmed, so that the Court will not have a vacancy while the task of \nselecting a new Justice is carried out. All of us regret Justice \nO'Connor's departure, but we are grateful for her service to the \nNation, and we wish her well in what I am sure will be an active \nretirement.\n  I hope that the President will choose a consensus nominee, who can \nbring the Nation together, as Justice O'Connor herself did, rather than \nfurther divide us. As President Bush and the Senate prepare to begin \nthe process of confirming Justice O'Connor's successor, consultation \nbetween the President and the Senate has an important role.\n  I was encouraged when the President met with the leaders of both \nparties in the Senate and on the Judiciary Committee a week ago. I am \nalso encouraged that the President has contacted a number of other \nSenators of both parties to hear their views. This was an important \nfirst step. But the sign of whether there has been a meaningful \nconsultation is not simply the process, but the result. In the past, \nreal consultation has led to consensus nominees, who could be easily \nconfirmed with the support of a large bipartisan majority of the Senate \nand the confidence of the American people.\n  To reach that result, consultation must be more than a one-way \nstreet. No one is suggesting that Senators co-nominate candidates for \nthe Supreme Court. But for Members of the Senate to provide advice to \nthe President, there must be a real discussion and a two-way \nconversation about specific candidates.\n  It is a fundamental part of our system of checks and balances that \nthe power to appoint judges, especially Justices of the Supreme Court, \nis shared by the President and Senators from all fifty States, so that \nthe Nation's diverse interests can be represented in this important \nchoice.\n  The Founders believed that the whole Senate and the President \ntogether would do the best job of confirming independent Supreme Court \njustices, who would be above politics, and not beholden to any \npolitician or political party. They wanted an independent, impartial \nSupreme Court that would give everyone a fair hearing, rather than \nfavoring powerful corporations or special interests with political \nclout.\n  In the early 1990s, as Senator Hatch recounts in his book, President \nClinton consulted with Senator Hatch--then the ranking Republican \nSenator on the Judiciary Committee--sharing the names of candidates he \nwas considering for the Supreme Court. President Clinton asked Senator \nHatch's opinion, even though Republicans were then in the minority in \nthe Senate. Senator Hatch recommended Stephen Breyer and Ruth Bader \nGinsburg. President Clinton agreed that these were excellent choices, \nand nominated Justice Ginsburg in 1993 and Justice Breyer in 1994. Both \nwere easily confirmed.\n  If the President takes seriously the advice of Senators from both \nparties on the persons he is considering, the result will be a \ndistinguished nominee who is acceptable to the vast majority of the \nAmerican people, and who will easily be confirmed. That was the case \nwhen Ronald Reagan nominated Justice O'Connor, a mainstream Republican, \nto the Court, and I am optimistic that this will be the case with her \nsuccessor. I hope the Senate and the White House can set aside \npartisanship, to ensure that the best possible person is nominated and \nconfirmed to the Court.\n  Consultation is about more than process. It is about an outcome, and \na consensus nominee is the best outcome for the Nation.\n  The importance of a consensus nominee is clear when we consider all \nof the vital issues decided by the Supreme Court, issues with enormous \nimpact on Americans and their daily lives.\n  A Supreme Court nomination matters to all Americans. It is not just \nabout a few hotly debated social issues. It is of great importance to \nevery man, woman and child in America because the decisions of the \nCourt affect their lives every day.\n  The Court's decisions affect whether employees' rights will be \nprotected in the workplace. They affect whether families will be able \nto obtain needed medical care under their health insurance policies. \nThey affect whether people will actually receive the retirement \nbenefits that they were promised. They affect whether people will be \nfree from discrimination in their daily lives. They affect whether \nstudents will be given fair consideration when they apply to college. \nThey affect whether persons with disabilities will have access to \npublic facilities and programs. They affect whether we will have \nresponsible environmental laws that keep our air and water clean. They \naffect whether large corporations are held accountable when they injure \nworkers and consumers.\n  The list goes on and on. Each of these issues has been addressed by \nthe Supreme Court in recent years. In many of those cases, the Court \nwas narrowly divided, and each of these areas is likely to be the \nsubject of future Court decisions in the years to come.\n  According to a recent article in the Washington Post, entitled \n``Business Pushes Its Own Brand of Justice,'' major corporations are \nready to ``bankroll large-scale efforts to promote the President's \nchoice'' if he nominates a candidate who will side with big business \nagainst workers, consumers and environmentalists. Eighteen million \ndollars has already been raised--much of it from these corporate \ninterests, and that amount is only the first installment of what they \nare willing to spend to influence the direction of the Court. In recent \nyears, approximately 40 percent of the Supreme Court's docket has been \ncases involving economic issues, and that pattern is likely to continue \nin coming years. So it is essential that the new justice be someone who \nwill hear these cases with an open mind, not someone who is biased in \nfavor of corporate wealth and power.\n  The outcome of such cases will obviously affect the wellbeing of all \nAmericans. The Nation is facing major economic challenges today. In the \nlast 4 years, we have lost 2.8 million manufacturing jobs. Long-term \nunemployment has nearly doubled. Outsourcing\n\n[[Page S8477]]\n\nthreatens to export millions more American jobs. Workers are losing \nhealth insurance and pension benefits at an alarming rate.\n  Those in the elected branches of our government have a responsibility \nto deal with these economic challenges--to develop innovative policies \nthat will provide greater economic security for workers and their \nfamilies--just as they did in earlier periods of economic difficulty. \nThose appointed to the Federal Courts--and particularly to the Supreme \nCourt--must respect the role of the elected branches in addressing \nthese urgent economic challenges. America cannot afford justices who \nwould turn back the clock to the Lochner era, and impose an extreme, \ndiscredited 19th century ideology on our Nation's 21st century economy.\n  That the Supreme Court plays such a major role in our national life \nis not new. When Alexis de Toqueville described America in the early \nyears of the 19th century, he noted that:\n\n     scarcely any political question arises in the United States \n     that is not resolved, sooner or later, into a judicial \n     question.\n\n  That fact has been true throughout our history. We are a nation of \nlaws. That is why it is so important for the President to nominate \nJustices with mainstream views who respect the national values of our \nConstitution, not ideological extremists who seek to impose their \npersonal philosophy on the American people.\n  I sincerely hope that President Bush will nominate a justice whose \nviews are in the national mainstream on these important issues, not one \nwho sees the role of the judiciary as the defender of entrenched \neconomic interests. The American people will be watching us closely, \nand they expect us to live up to our oath of office to defend the \nConstitution and its great promise of equal protection of the laws for \nall our people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/19/senate-section/article/S8477-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8477-S8478]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                       Specialist Adam N. Brewer\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I would like to honor one of America's \nfallen, a brave soldier from the State of Oklahoma. SPC Adam Brewer was \nserving in Iraq when he died defending his fellow soldiers and this \nNation. His memory continues on in testimony to the selfless way he \nlived.\n  Specialist Brewer graduated from Bartlesville High School in 2000 and \njoined the Army shortly thereafter. He served for 2 years and was \nassigned to 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry Regiment, normally stationed \nFort Hood, TX. Specialist Brewer was serving his second tour in Iraq \nand had taken part in the original invasion that began in March 2003. \nOn February 25, 2005, his unit was deployed to an area near Taji, Iraq. \nAn improvised explosive device exploded nearby, tragically killing him \nand two other soldiers.\n  At Specialist Brewer's funeral, the pastor put it well: ``Not only \ndid he defend our country but he defended the values of freedom that we \nhold so dear . . . I know his passing has been hard. But for the rest \nof your life, whenever you see his picture or mention his name, you can \nbe proud.'' We are indeed proud, as we are of those young men and women \nwho have committed to defend our Nation and put their lives on the line \nevery day.\n  But I think Specialist Brewer's mother Karen Brewer said it best, \n``He wanted to serve his country, and he served it all the way.'' He \nindeed gave all that he had, in life and in death, for his country. The \nlegacy of such sacrifice challenges us on behalf of the Senate, this \nNation, and the cause of freedom around the world, I honor a special \nOklahoman and true soldier, SPC Adam Brewer.\n\n\n                    Specialist Robert T. Hendrickson\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to honor a true hero who, on February 1, 2005, \ngave his life while serving in Iraq. SPC Robert Hendrickson is an \nexample of the selfless service that is essential to this country's \nfreedom.\n  Although he was born in Biloxi, MS, Specialist Hendrickson listed \nBroken Bow, OK, as his hometown. He attended school in Del City and \nEdmond before moving with his mother to Broken Bow. His father, Dave \nHendrickson, says his son planned to return to school when he returned \nfrom service and study to become a pediatric nurse.\n  After high school, Specialist Hendrickson enlisted in the U.S. Army. \nHe was assigned to the 2d Battalion, 5th Cavalry Regiment, 1st Cavalry \nDivision, normally stationed in Fort Hood, TX. He was serving in Iraq \nwith this unit when, just after the successful elections took place, \nhis vehicle overturned. He was found unconscious and never recovered.\n  He died to help the Iraqi people achieve their freedom,'' Dave \nHendrickson said. ``He died for the Iraqi people and the war against \nterrorism so that his son might have a safer world to live in.''\n  Specialist Hendrickson is survived by his parents, his sister, and a \n6-year-old son, Dylan. ``He loved Dylan more than anything,'' Dave \nsaid. ``My son was a good boy. He was a good man. He was a good dad.''\n  SPC Robert Hendrickson was indeed a good man. He put aside his own \nsafety, volunteering to serve in the most dangerous of professions. He \ngave so much and his sacrifice will be remembered by friends, family, \nand all of us who are profoundly indebted to him.\n\n\n                    Staff Sergeant Jason R. Hendrix\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise to honor a brave soldier who gave \nhis life to the defense of this Nation. SSG. Jason Hendrix chose to \nplace himself in harms way and for this service he paid the highest \nprice.\n  Staff Sergeant Hendrix joined the Army right out of high school and \nserved for 11 years. He was a squad leader in the 1st Battalion, 9th \nInfantry Regiment, 2nd Infantry Division. This unit is usually \nstationed in South Korea, but was deployed to assist in Operation Iraqi \nFreedom. When Staff Sergeant Hendrix found out that he was heading for \none of the most dangerous areas in the world, he told his family, ``You \nguys might not understand why we're over here, but we need to be over \nhere, and I've got to do my job.''\n  Those who knew Staff Sergeant Hendrix best describe him as a \n``professional soldier.'' They also speak of his compassion and care \nfor the men in his unit. Last Christmas, Staff Sergeant Hendrix gave up \nhis leave so that other men could go home and see their newborn \nchildren. He also bought, at his own expense, equipment for his men \nsuch as night-vision goggles, facemasks, flashlights, dozens of \nhandcuffs and magazine couplers for their M-16s.\n  Staff Sergeant Hendrix fought in the rebel stronghold of Fallujah \nlate last year and was serving in Ar Ramadi at the time of his death. \nOn February 16, 2005, he was leading a 25-man squad when they came \nunder a heavy artillery attack. Staff Sergeant Hendrix was hit and died \nfrom his wounds.\n  For this soldier from Claremore, Ok, there is no deeper honor than \nthe memory he leaves behind. He gave of himself in life as well as in \ndeath, and stands out as an example to all of us. Today I honor a true \nhero, SSG. Jason Hendrix.\n\n\n                     Specialist Jeffrey S. Henthorn\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to rise in honor of a son of Oklahoma and an \nAmerican hero. SPC Jeffery Henthorn demonstrated the type of patriotism \nthat protects our freedom and encourages freedom in other countries. \nFor his dedication and sacrifice I am pleased to honor him on the \nSenate floor today.\n  Specialist Henthorn was from Choctaw, OK. After earning his high \nschool degree, Specialist Henthorn enlisted in the Army and was \nassigned to the 24th Transportation Company, out of Fort Riley, KS.\n  Specialist Henthorn was serving in Iraq as part of Operation Iraqi \nFreedom. He died on February 8, 2005, while stationed in Balad, Iraq, \nfrom noncombat related injuries. He was 25 years old and leaves behind \nfamily and friends who grieve along with our grateful Nation.\n  Specialist Henthorn was willing to place his life on the line and \npaid the fullest cost for the sake of freedom. On behalf of the U.S. \nSenate, I wish to express my profound gratitude and deepest honor for \nthe men and women who, like Specialist Henthorn, know the true meaning \nof service. They continue to give so much, and as freedom spreads \nthroughout the Middle East region we know that their sacrifice has not \nbeen in vain.\n  I honor the life and memory of those who have given their lives in \nthis noble cause. I am grieved, but very proud of this young man from \nOklahoma, SPC Jeffery Henthorn.\n\n[[Page S8478]]\n\n                   Army Specialist. Lyle W. Rymer II\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to honor one of this country's fallen warriors, \na young man that comes from my home State of Oklahoma. Army SPC Lyle \nRymer II was making way for freedom in Iraq when he paid the ultimate \nprice.\n  Specialist Rymer was born in Roland, OK. After graduating from high \nschool, he joined the National Guard to help his family. ``That's what \nhe decided to do,'' his grandmother Bobby Sue Drake said. ``He liked \nit. He said, `Somebody's got to defend this country. It might as well \nbe me.' He was a great kid.'' According to his friends, he planned to \nmake a career of the Army and was considering enrolling in Airborne \nschool. Rymer also had a reputation for cheering up fellow soldiers.\n  Specialist Rymer was serving in Iraq with the 239th Engineer Company, \nan Arkansas-based National Guard unit. On January 28, 2005, he was \nguarding an area where engineers were setting up barriers in \npreparation for the elections. Without warning, he was shot by an enemy \nsniper and died from his wounds. Army Specialist Rymer is buried at \nFort Smith National Cemetery, AR.\n  Many are left behind who are both proud and grieved at his sacrifice. \nSpecialist Rymer is survived by his wife LaTisha, a 2-year-old son, \nSean, and a 10-month-old daughter, Jasmine. He was able to see his \nnewborn daughter during a November furlough.\n  The loss of Specialist Rymer is one that will continue to be felt as \nthe years pass. He was one who gave more than was required, in life and \nin death. He sacrificed his own well-being and put himself in harm's \nway, showing courage that demands our recognition. I am honored to \nhonor him, and hope that I somehow express gratefulness beyond these \nmere words.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/19/senate-section/article/S8478-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8478-S8479]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        SECURING A LIABILITY AGREEMENT ON PLUTONIUM DISPOSITION\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have come to the Senate floor today to \nmake my colleagues aware of an important achievement by the Bush \nadministration to secure an agreement with the Russian Government to \nensure that a major nonproliferation program moves forward. This \nagreement will resolve the longstanding disagreement on liability \nassociated with the construction of Mixed Oxide, MOX, Fuel Fabrication \nFacility in Russia.\n  This agreement will permit the U.S. and Russia to move forward with \nthe construction of dual MOX fuel fabrication facilities to turn \nweapons-grade plutonium into civilian mixed-oxide fuel that can be \nburned in commercial nuclear reactors. Each side will dispose of 34 \ntons of excess plutonium.\n  Today the U.S.-Russian counterparts will agree to the terms of an \nagreement negotiated during the G8 summit in Scotland earlier this \nmonth. It was during this summit in which terrorists attempted to \ndisrupt the meeting by setting off simultaneous explosions in the \nLondon subway, killing over 40 innocent victims. This senseless \nviolence underscores the importance of eliminating the possibility, \nhowever remote, that terrorists might secure and use plutonium or \nhighly enriched uranium in their acts of terror against civilian or \nmilitary targets.\n  As we see the world become more and more dangerous, it is critical \nthat we make progress on reprocessing plutonium into MOX. Black \nmarketers and terrorists would love to get their hands on this \nplutonium. President Bush has worked hard to engage President Putin on \nthis issue, and as a result of that continuing dialogue there is now an \nagreement to implement a MOX program.\n  I am very pleased that this agreement has been made because it will \ngive us a surefire way to dispose of weapons-grade material while at \nthe same time providing economic benefits to both countries. I am \nhopeful the Russian Duma will take quick action.\n  This agreement breaks a 2-year diplomatic impasse that has stalled \nthe construction of fuel fabrication facilities in the United States \nand Russia.\n  I would like to recognize the efforts of Secretary of State \nCondoleezza Rice, Under Secretary of State John Bolton, Secretary of \nEnergy Samuel Bodman, and the entire Office of Nuclear Nonproliferation \nwithin the NNSA. Both the State Department, which negotiated the \ndiplomatic solutions, and the Department of Energy, which has \nresponsibility for managing the design, construction, and operation of \nthe Nation's first plutonium reprocessing plant, have been exceptional. \nBoth teams have worked hard to realize the ultimate goal of eliminating \n34 tons of weapons-grade plutonium from each of the U.S. and Russian \nstockpiles.\n  Over the past year I have pressed the Department of Energy and the \nState Department to resolve the liability issue. Upon their \nconfirmations, both Secretary Rice and Secretary Bodman have committed \ntheir full support, and they should be proud of their early success.\n  The effort to address the elimination of excess weapons-grade \nmaterial has been under consideration for over a decade. President \nGeorge Bush's term initiated the earliest efforts to identify excess \nweapons-grade material. Over the next decade, the Clinton \nadministration worked with then-President Yeltsin to consider options \nfor eliminating excess material.\n  In 1994, the National Academy of Sciences', NAS, report on the \n``Management and Disposition of Excess Weapons Plutonium'' found that \nexcess material constituted a ``clear and present danger.'' That same \nyear a joint DOE-DOD review found that 38.2 metric tons of plutonium \nand 174.3 metric tons of highly enriched uranium were surplus to U.S. \ndefense needs. A programmatic environmental impact statement was \nundertaken to evaluate options for disposal of this material.\n  In 1995, U.S. and Russian experts met at Los Alamos to provide \nrecommendations on plutonium disposition. Since those early meetings \nthe labs have contributed a considerable amount of time and effort to \nsupport this initiative. In fact, Los Alamos prepared the plutonium \nthat is being used as the initial test fuel assembly currently being \nburned in the Catawba reactor owned by Duke Power.\n  In April 1996, at the Moscow Nuclear Safety and Security Summit, it \nwas determined that irradiating plutonium as part of a mixed oxide fuel \nin commercial reactors and vitrification are appropriate strategies for \ndisposal.\n  In June 1997, the Independent Holdren-Velikhov Commission issued a \nfinal report recommending a disposal pathway identified at the Moscow \nSummit. The report is a joint U.S. and Russian National Academy of \nScience review.\n  In July 1998, the U.S. and Russia signed a Scientific and Technical \nCooperation Agreement that provides for a joint, small-scale test of \ndisposition pathways. This agreement also provided a 5-year liability \nagreement between the United States. and Russia for coverage of U.S. \nworkers in Russia that expired in July 2003.\n  In September 1998, President Clinton and President Yeltsin entered \ninto a bilateral plutonium disposition agreement.\n  In October 1998, I included $200 million in ``emergency'' funding \ndedicated entirely to plutonium disposition to demonstrate to Russia \nthe firm U.S. commitment to plutonium disposition. This funding \npersuaded Russia to enter into serious negotiations. Today, $150 \nmillion of those funds remains available for use to initiate \nconstruction.\n\n  That same month, G8 members established the Multilateral Plutonium \nDisposition Group and committed to international financing of the \nRussian plutonium program. As of January 2005, total pledges from the \nU.S., U.K., Canada, Japan, Italy, and France total $865 million. I am \nconfident that with the liability issue resolved additional funding \nwill be made available to support the Russian effort. The U.S. will \nfulfill its commitment to build the U.S facility on it own.\n  In March 1999, the U.S. awarded the MOX facility contract to Duke \nCogema Stone and Webster--DCS--to design the U.S. MOX Fuel Fabrication \nFacility. In August, DOE awarded a contract to design the Pit \nDisassemble and Conversion Facility.\n  In January 2000, DOE issued a Record of Decision on locating the pit \nconversion and fuel fabrication facility at Savannah River, SC.\n  In September 2000, the United States and Russia signed the Plutonium \nManagement and Disposition Agreement, which calls for each country to \ndispose of 34 tons of weapons-grade plutonium\n\n[[Page S8479]]\n\nin parallel. It was agreed that construction would begin by 2003. \nUnfortunately, one item left unresolved in that agreement was the \nquestion of liability protection for the U.S. for work performed in \nRussia.\n  In January 2001, the Bush administration began a year-long review of \nall nonproliferation programs with Russia. During this review, the \ncontracting team submitted a construction authorization request to the \nNuclear Regulatory Commission for approval.\n  January 2002, the administration decided to pursue a MOX-only pathway \nand put an end to further work on a vitrification program.\n  In September 2002, MINATOM, the Russian counterpart to the Department \nof Energy, agreed to use an identical design of the U.S. proposed MOX \nfacility.\n  In July 2003, the temporary 5-year limited liability coverage \nprovided under the 1998 Science and Technical Cooperation Agreement \nexpired.\n  In February 2004, without a formal agreement on liability, the U.S. \nannounced a delay in the program. Plans to initiate construction in May \n2004 were delayed until May 2005.\n  August 2004, the Russians begin site characterization work at the \nSiberian Chemical Combine in Seversk, Russia, as a location of the MOX \nfacility. The site has been cleared and is awaiting construction. \nUnlike the Savannah River site, which has a year-round construction \nseason, the Seversk site is limited to work in the summer.\n  In September 2004, Los Alamos shipped 125 kilograms of surplus \nplutonium to France for fabrication into MOX fuel assemblies for a test \nburn in a commercial U.S. reactor. This activity is undertaken in \nFrance since the design of the U.S and Russian fuel fabrication \nfacility is identical to the French facility that is currently \nreprocessing spent commercial fuel for European and Asian customers. \nThe shipments between the U.S. and France occurred without incident and \nthe lead test assemblies are now being used in the Catawba reactor \nowned and operated by Duke Power.\n  In December 2004, the engineering team completed the licensable \ndesign of the U.S facility, and the NRC awarded the construction permit \nfor the U.S. facility in March 2005.\n  On April 20, 2005, the U.S. offered a new liability agreement that \nwas ultimately accepted by the Russian Government in July 2005. It took \nseveral months of intense lobbying to pressure the U.S. interagency \nprocess to produce a liability agreement that was not identical to the \nliability terms provided under the Cooperative Threat Reduction \nAgreement.\n  On July 19, 2005, the United States and Russia agreed to the terms of \na final liability package. This agreement must go to President Putin to \nbe drafted and published as a Presidential decree. Once circulated, \nSecretary Rice and her counterpart in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs \nwill officially sign the agreement, which will then go to the Russian \nDuma for ratification.\n  Once this document is signed by Secretary Rice, the Department of \nEnergy will move forward with a site clearing activities in Savannah \nRiver, SC, with construction to commence in fiscal year 2006.\n  I am proud of the fact that two different administrations have \nfollowed through on this bilateral initiative, and we are now \napproaching another critical juncture. Following a decade of successful \nand numerous scientific, environmental and regulatory reviews, we are \nat a stage where it is important that Congress maintain an adequate and \nreliable level of funding to complete construction.\n  I am aware of the fact that the House and Senate Armed Services \nCommittees have reduced funding for MOX construction but have preserved \nthe funding within other nonproliferation accounts. I am hopeful that \nduring the consideration of the Senate defense authorization bill, \nChairman Warner and Senator Levin will agree to restore the funding \nback into the MOX construction accounts.\n  In addition, I am hopeful that I will be successful in convincing the \nHouse to restore critical funding that was eliminated from the MOX \nconstruction program. Of the $360 million requested for construction, \nthe House only provided $35 million. Failure to provide adequate \nfunding would undermine a decade of cooperation between the U.S. and \nRussia and do nothing to reduce the amount of excess plutonium.\n  If we are unable to fully fund the construction program and keep the \nproject on track it will prevent the U.S. from consolidating plutonium \nacross the weapons complex and could result in a $100 million per year \npenalties to be paid to the State of South Carolina as mandated in the \nFiscal Year 2003 National Defense Authorization Act. We have come too \nfar to not complete this project.\n  I have believed in this initiative from the beginning and believe we \ncan do more to reduce the threat from nuclear proliferation. I am \ncommitted to seeing additional resources be used in securing Russian \nwarheads beyond the reach of terrorists. I am committed to strong \nenforcement by the U.S. or International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, to \nbreak up the nuclear black market, where nuclear technology and \nscientific expertise can be bought for a price.\n  The stakes are too high and the price too great to consider anything \nbut an aggressive effort by the U.S. and our global partners to prevent \nthe spread of nuclear material.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/19/senate-section/article/S8479-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8479-S8483]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                SENATOR GAYLORD NELSON MEMORIAL SERVICE\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ntranscript from Senator Gaylord Nelson's memorial service in Madison, \nWI, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Gaylord Nelson's Memorial Service, July 13, 2005, Wisconsin State \n                                Capitol\n\n       Performance of ``Glorious Things of Thee are Spoken''--\n     Clear Lake High School Brass Quintet\n       William H. Meadows: That hymn, by Haydn, was performed by \n     the brass quintet from Clear Lake High School, directed by \n     Mike Larson. Their participation is quite appropriate, since \n     Gaylord Nelson, whom we honor today, played trumpet in the \n     Clear Lake High School band. To hear him tell it, he did not \n     play it very well. (Laughter.) Later in life, Gaylord learned \n     that he was on the enemies list of the Nixon White House, but \n     was puzzled about what he could have done to become a Nixon \n     enemy. ``Maybe he heard me play the trumpet in the Clear Lake \n     band,'' Gaylord said. (Laughter).\n       Good afternoon, I'm Bill Meadows, I'm president of The \n     Wilderness Society and today I have the honor to pay tribute \n     to my friend and colleague, Gaylord Nelson, and introduce \n     others who knew and loved him well. We are here to testify to \n     the incredible mark he left on all of our worlds. Joining us \n     today in celebrating Gaylord's life, of course, are Carrie \n     Lee Nelson and the Nelson family; Governor and Mrs. Doyle; \n     Senator Kohl; Senator Feingold; Senator Bayh; Senator \n     Bingaman; Senator Biden; Senator Abourezk; Representative \n     Obey; Representative Petri; Representative Baldwin; \n     Representative Kind; Representative Moore; Representative \n     Kastenmeier; Representative Baldus; Vice President Mondale; \n     former Governors Lucey, Schreiber, Earl, McCallum, and Mrs. \n     Reynolds; Lieutenant Governor Lawton; Attorney General \n     Lautenschlager; Treasurer Voight; Superintendent Burmaster; \n     members of the Wisconsin Legislature; members of the \n     Wisconsin Supreme Court; and citizens of Clear Lake, \n     Wisconsin.\n       The story about the Clear Lake band is typical Gaylord. \n     Gaylord--the Governor, the United States Senator, the founder \n     of Earth day--was an irrepressible raconteur. But of the many \n     accolades he received in his lifetime, I think this man, the \n     father of the modern environmental movement, would want to be \n     remembered first for being a good husband and father to the \n     family he cherished. I'd like to take a moment to recognize \n     Carrie Lee, Gaylord's beloved wife of 57 years, whose \n     unwavering support meant so much to him, not the least of \n     which was that he always had a good audience. And his three \n     children, Tia, Happy, Jeff, and their spouses, and his \n     grandchildren. (Applause.)\n       Gaylord joined The Wilderness Society family 25 years ago, \n     serving as our counselor and special convener of after-hours, \n     post-board meeting poker games.\n       For the last nine years, I have had the pleasure of working \n     a few doors down from his office. However, my relationship \n     with Gaylord began in 1970, when Earth Day motivated me to \n     get involved in environmental issues. One thing led to \n     another and the rest, as they say, is history. I now have the \n     privilege of working every day to protect America's \n     extraordinary wilderness, using the Wilderness Act of 1964, \n     just one of the many remarkable laws Gaylord Nelson co-\n     sponsored during his tenure in the Senate.\n       Recently, Congress saw fit to pay respect to Gaylord with a \n     wilderness area named in his honor, a place that he always \n     felt was part of his very blood and bones. This beautiful \n     State of Wisconsin, the Gaylord A. Nelson Apostle Islands \n     Lakeshore Wilderness, will forever protect the wild lands and \n     wild\n\n[[Page S8480]]\n\n     creatures that inhabit more than 33,000 acres on Lake \n     Superior. There may not have been any greater tribute we, or \n     anyone, can pay to this man than preserving a piece of the \n     planet he loved so dearly.\n       I would like to close by reading some of Gaylord's own \n     words, which eloquently express who he was. His message on \n     Earth Day 2000 encapsulated his views as a new century began: \n     ``The wealth of our Nation is in its air, water, soil, \n     forest, minerals, rivers, lakes, oceans, scenic beauty, \n     wildlife habitat, and biodiversity. Take this resource base \n     away and all that's left is a wasteland. The economy is a \n     wholly owned subsidiary of the environment. That's where all \n     the economic activity and all the jobs come from. We are \n     pursuing a self-destructive course of fueling our economies \n     by drawing down our natural capitol, by degrading and \n     depleting our resource base and counting it on the income \n     side of the ledger. This obviously is not a sustainable \n     situation for the long term. Forging and maintaining a \n     sustainable society is a challenge for this and all \n     generations to come.''\n       ``We need a generation imbued--(applause)--we need a \n     generation imbued with an environmental ethic,'' Nelson said \n     repeatedly over the years, ``an environmental ethic which \n     causes society to always ask the question: `If we intrude on \n     this work of nature, what will the consequences be?' Such an \n     ethic would recognize the bonds that unite the species man \n     with the natural systems of the planet and would affirm \n     human's stewardship role on the planet.''\n       This message and goal has not changed in a half century \n     since Aldo Leopold wrote, in A Sand County Almanac, of the \n     need for what he called a land ethic. Leopold wrote: ``A land \n     ethic, then, reflects the existence of an ecological \n     conscience and this in turn reflects a conviction of \n     individual responsibility for the health of the land. The \n     land ethic changes the role of Homo sapiens from conqueror of \n     the land community to a plain member and citizen of it.'' \n     That, in a few sentences, was what the environmental movement \n     was all about. Nelson's environmentalism was a direct \n     descendant of Leopold's conservation.\n       Gaylord Nelson's friendship transcends political parties. \n     One of the remarkable things about Gaylord was his ability to \n     disagree with people on issues without being disagreeable. \n     One of the best examples is his friendship with Melvin Laird. \n     They met as state senators in 1948. Laird was the Republican \n     floor leader and Nelson, the Democratic leader. They would \n     fiercely debate the issues all day long on the floor of the \n     Senate, but once the Senate would adjourn, they too would \n     adjourn for drinks and socializing at the Park Hotel. As \n     often as not, Laird would end up later at the Nelsons' home \n     for dinner and spend the evening with Gaylord and Carrie Lee. \n     That friendship survived some trying times, as Melvin Laird \n     went on to the House of Representatives; Gaylord, to the \n     governorship and then to the U.S. Senate. It survived Laird's \n     days as Nixon's Secretary of Defense during the Vietnam War, \n     when Nelson was one of the outspoken opponents of the war.\n       Secretary Laird is unable to be here to participate today \n     because of health problems, so representing him is \n     Congressman Thomas Petri, a Republican who began his career \n     in the Wisconsin State Senate and who was elected to the \n     House of Representatives in a special election in 1979. While \n     a State Senator, Tom Petri ran against Gaylord Nelson as the \n     Republican candidate for U.S. Senate in 1974. Gaylord had \n     praise for his opponent, calling Tom Petri an able, honest, \n     talented, fair-minded, perceptive man of commitment and \n     dedication. He added with a laugh, ``How often do you find \n     two people like that in the same election?'' (Laughter, \n     applause). Congressman Petri. (Applause.)\n       U.S. Representative Thomas Petri: Because his doctor \n     advised him not to travel, Mel Laird asked me to pass on a \n     few words about his great and good friend, former Wisconsin \n     State Senate colleague and colleague in Washington and in \n     Wisconsin, Gaylord Nelson. They served together in the \n     Republican State Senate where Laird was the Republican \n     leader. Of course he was Congressman and also served as our \n     Nation's Secretary of Defense. I am quite honored to say a \n     few words for Mr. Laird, but actually when I was first asked \n     to speak here it occurred to me that perhaps I was invited \n     because I played a vital role in Senator Nelson's last \n     successful political campaign. (Laughter.) I was the one who \n     lost. (Laughter.)\n       Well, be that as it may, Gaylord was a Democrat and Mel \n     Laird, a Republican. But as has been pointed out, that \n     difference did not prevent them from becoming great and good \n     friends. From the late 1940s, in Wisconsin, where they were \n     both members of the Piscatorial and Inside Straight Society, \n     a bipartisan group that fished together, tell stories to each \n     other, lie about each other, and play gin rummy. And Nelson's \n     wife, Carrie Lee, understood both Gaylord and Mel and put up \n     with their many discussions far into the night in both \n     Madison and out in Washington. Carrie Lee once told Mel that \n     she had to throw Mel out of the Nelson apartment more often \n     than any other person. (Laughter.)\n       When Mel was the majority leader in the State Senate in \n     1948, Gaylord led the tiny Democratic delegation that at that \n     time had just five members, of the 33. That was less than the \n     one-third Gaylord needed to force a record vote on \n     legislation. Mel says that he always made sure that enough \n     Republicans would vote ``Aye'' in order to let Gaylord force \n     a roll call vote. He said that Gaylord was always very \n     grateful, choosing to ignore the fact that Mel allowed the \n     votes in order to show that Gaylord could only muster five \n     measly votes for his legislation. (Laughter.)\n       Years later, when Mel was Secretary of Defense and Gaylord \n     was a U.S. Senator, Mel took his pals to the Army Navy Club \n     for a few adult beverages. Soon enough, they were arguing \n     about the emergency hotline between Washington and Moscow. \n     Secretary of Defense Laird said that it was located at the \n     Pentagon and Senator Nelson said that our end of the hotline \n     was at the White House. The two made a bet on it and the \n     Senator said to the Defense Secretary, ``Well, let's go down \n     to the Pentagon and you can show it to me if it's really \n     there.'' The two arrived at the Pentagon's command center, \n     where Mel introduced Gaylord to the officer on duty, who was \n     shocked to see the Defense Secretary and a U.S. Senator waltz \n     in during the wee hours of the morning. Mel had the officer \n     run a communications test to demonstrate that the line with \n     Moscow was functioning and Mel won the bet. Now that little \n     anecdote has already made it into the papers, but Mel wanted \n     me to pass on one additional detail. The two buddies had been \n     enjoying them so much that when they were dropped back off at \n     the Army Navy Club, Gaylord couldn't remember where his car \n     was and in fact didn't find it for three days. (Laughter.)\n       Now here's a story that was passed on to me by, I think, \n     the late Jimmy Wimmer, who worked for Nelson when he was \n     Governor. We all know about Gaylord's concerns about the \n     environment and his early warnings about our involvement \n     in Vietnam. But also Gaylord was, like Jimmy, a great \n     anglophile. On one occasion, Gaylord was sitting next to a \n     member of the House of Lords at dinner and the British \n     gentleman kept referring to Gaylord as Senator Nelson. \n     Finally, Senator Nelson leaned over and said, ``Oh no, \n     please call me Gaylord.'' Then the fellow said, ``Very \n     well, Gaylord.'' And after a pause, Nelson said, ``And \n     what may I call you?'' Well, the British man looked at him \n     and said, ``Well, Gaylord, you may call me `my lord.''' \n     (Laughter).\n       Well, different people have different styles but I \n     particularly like Gaylord's style. He was, perhaps, the most \n     liked person in the U.S. Senate while he was there and the \n     most liked on both sides of the political aisle. Senator \n     Eagleton says that Senator Nelson never said anything bad \n     about anybody. He was never down in the dumps, he was never a \n     naysayer, he was never cross.\n       Now Mel Laird asked me to emphasize this: in the political \n     arena, Mel and Gaylord would fight hammer and tongs. But at \n     the end of the day, they could share a beverage and carry on \n     a spirited, friendly conversation. Gaylord helped promote \n     civility between Democrats and Republicans. The parties could \n     have great disagreements, but he helped to maintain \n     friendship and ultimately common purpose, which potentially \n     included everybody. Over the years that I've been in \n     Washington, the Congress has grown increasingly polarized \n     with each party seeking any advantage. Gaylord Nelson would \n     have had none of that. He called on us all to be better than \n     that, to treat everyone with friendship and with respect. As \n     Mel Laird says, and I concur, we could all use a lot more of \n     Gaylord's civility in politics these days. (Applause.)\n       William H. Meadows: When I looked around early I did not \n     see former Governor Thompson and I want recognize him now and \n     thank him for being with us this afternoon. Congressman David \n     Obey has been a Nelson family friend for more than 40 years. \n     He began his political career in the State Assembly, winning \n     a seat in 1962--the same year that Gaylord was elected to the \n     U.S. Senate. It was David Obey who was with Gaylord in Wausau \n     in the summer of 1964, when Gaylord first spoke out about the \n     Vietnam War and warned that escalating a ground war there \n     would be a tragic mistake. David Obey was elected to the \n     House of Representatives in 1969 in a special election to \n     replace Mel Laird when Laird became Secretary of Defense. As \n     we environmentalists like to say, everything is connected. He \n     has been chairman of the House Appropriations Committee and \n     is currently the ranking Democratic member of that committee. \n     Congressman Obey. (Applause.)\n       U.S. Rep. David Obey: Thank you, thank you, thank you. \n     There's an old maxim about political funerals and memorial \n     services. The biggest one I ever saw was for Phil Burton, a \n     controversial congressman from California. Had a huge crowd. \n     And when it was over, Phil's brother John observed to the \n     press that the reason the crowd was so large was because half \n     of the crowd came to bid Phil goodbye and the other half came \n     to make sure that he was leaving. (Laughter.) This day is \n     very different. What a great life we are celebrating here \n     today. When Gaylord left the Senate, Carrie Lee said the \n     State of Wisconsin got 30 good years out of Gaylord. Well, \n     all of us got 89 good years out of Gaylord and Gaylord got 89 \n     good years out of life.\n       There is (applause), there is no doubt that Gaylord will be \n     remembered through the years for his leadership on the \n     environment. If he had never served a day in the United \n     States Senate, he would still have been remembered as one of \n     Wisconsin's great leaders because of the pioneering Outdoor \n     Recreation Act that he passed as Governor. And what he \n     accomplished in that field in the\n\n[[Page S8481]]\n\n     Senate is truly remarkable. I will not repeat it to you, you \n     know the litany, you know what the accomplishments are.\n       What is also amazing about Gaylord is that he led in so \n     many other areas: auto and tire safety, drug safety and \n     pricing, manpower training, the Older Americans Act, legal \n     services for the poor. People will not remember this--Howard \n     Temin would, if he were still at the University of \n     Wisconsin--but on cancer research, Gaylord stood as one man \n     against the entire United States Senate to prevent the cancer \n     institute from being politicized and being directly linked to \n     the White House. He lost the initial vote, he was the only \n     vote in the Senate cast against that legislation. But by the \n     time it was over, he had turned the entire U.S. Senate around \n     and he saved the organizational integrity of the National \n     Institutes of Health.\n       On civil rights (applause), on civil rights, in 1963 after \n     the bombing of the 16th Street Church in Birmingham, my \n     friend Joe Wilson and Ed Harris wrote an article for The \n     Progressive magazine entitled ``Hucksters of Hate'' about the \n     role of J.B. Stoner and the Christian Knights of the Ku Klux \n     Klan. Joe said afterwards that for months he carried a .38 \n     Smith & Wesson on his hip, fearing that the Klan would come \n     after him. He said he felt a little less lonely, a little \n     less frightened after Gaylord put the story in the \n     Congressional Record to show that someone was watching.\n       And he stood, as has been mentioned, as one of three \n     against the first increased appropriations for Vietnam. I do \n     remember in 1965 going to Channel 7 in Wausau.\n       Gaylord gave an interview on Vietnam and halfway through \n     the interviewer stopped the camera and he said, ``Senator, \n     I'm sorry, you just misspoke. You said that we have 500,000 \n     troops in Vietnam.'' Gaylord said, ``That's right, we will.'' \n     And the announcer said, ``Well, okay, it's your funeral,'' \n     and he resumed the interview. And when we walked out of that \n     station, Gaylord turned to me and he said, ``You know, I may \n     have beaten myself tonight.'' But he said, ``that's what I \n     really believe will happen.'' If the country and if LBJ had \n     listened to Gaylord, there would be one less war memorial to \n     visit on the Mall in Washington, D.C. And 50,000 (applause) \n     Americans, and 50,000 Americans would not have died.\n       There were two things about Gaylord that were especially \n     special. First, in almost everything he did, the causes he \n     fought for were fundamental, he did not trivialize his life, \n     and he changed the way people thought. In short, he was \n     precisely the kind of person that politics is all too short \n     of these days. On his signature issue, the environment \n     (applause) on his signature issue, the environment, Gaylord \n     took Aldo Leopold's conservation ethic and made people \n     understand that it was not just about birds, and fish, and \n     wildlife, and natural beauty. He drove home the point that \n     the most fundamental bond between us as biological creatures \n     on this planet is through the common air that we breath, the \n     water we drink, the land we walk, and that the most basic \n     test of our respect for one another, for those who have gone \n     before, and for those who will come after, is the way we meet \n     our stewardship responsibilities to the ecosystem that \n     sustains us all.\n       The second thing about Gaylord, that was so special, is the \n     way he played the game. Someone said last week that Gaylord \n     had no enemies. That is not true. He had one. His name was \n     Richard Nixon. And during Watergate, as has been referred to \n     already, we learned that Nixon had made a list of enemies he \n     wanted to do in. And that Gaylord was on the list along with \n     Bill Proxmire and Bob Kastenmeier. What we loved about \n     Gaylord is that we could never have imagined Gaylord \n     compiling an enemies list of his own.\n       Gaylord was my dear friend, my mentor, and my political \n     hero.\n       Wisconsin has experienced two progressive revolutions in \n     the twentieth century. The first was led by Bob La Follette \n     at the turn of the last century and the second after the \n     collapse of the progressive party in 1946, was led by a host \n     of young reformers who remain the Democratic Party. People \n     like Elliot Walstead, Jim Doyle, Tom Fairchild, Frank \n     Nikolay, Horace Wilkie, Carl Thompson, John Reynolds, Henry \n     Royce, Bob Kastenmeier, Pat Lucey, Bill Proxmire, and Gaylord \n     Nelson, and so many others. And Gaylord's election as \n     Governor in 1958 was the culmination of that second \n     progressive revival. And the La Follette tradition ran \n     straight through him to the next generation of people who saw \n     Gaylord as an example. People like me, Tom Loftus, Tony Earl, \n     Tammy Baldwin, Russ Feingold, Herb Kohl, and so many others.\n       I would never have been elected to Congress without his \n     help. He sent Louie Hanson into my district, took one look at \n     amateur city, and decided Louie had better stay for a while. \n     (Laughter, applause.) We know how Gaylord loved to campaign. \n     He came into my district seven weekends in a row; I would not \n     have won without it. The causes he fought for and the way he \n     fought for them made me and all of us gathered here today \n     proud to be in his country or in his company.\n       Now we all have our favorite stories about Gaylord. Mine \n     are those that he told about Clear Lake and Polk County, \n     trying to loosen up his audiences. Harvey Dueholm, was a \n     State Representative. He grew up with Gaylord. He had great \n     courage and earthy wit. He had a face like a basset hound on \n     a bad day. (Laughter.) Harvey told the stories about the \n     mischief that Gaylord got into as a child. And he told a \n     congressional committee once, ``We all knew Gaylord would \n     grow up to be in an institution, we just didn't know it'd be \n     the United States Senate.'' (Laughter.)\n       My favorite story is one that occurred in this building. \n     Gaylord was governor, the Republicans controlled the \n     legislature. They wanted to solve the deficit by raising the \n     sales tax, Democrats wanted the income tax to be increased. \n     So Gaylord compromised and had a little bit of both, went \n     into the Democratic caucus to explain and when he was done, \n     Bill Lorge, from St. Croix County, Dueholm's roommate, stood \n     up and said, ``Gaylord, I love you like a brother. But when I \n     go over to the Belmont Hotel tonight, and I take my clothes \n     off, and I put my pajamas on, and I climb into my bed, and \n     put my head on that pillow, and I put my false teeth in that \n     glass of salt water, my conscience won't let me vote for a \n     sales tax. Well, Harvey Dueholm stood up and said, ``Mr. \n     Chairman, I have a suggestion for the gentleman. The next \n     time they go over to the Belmont Hotel, you take your clothes \n     off, you put your pajamas on, you climb into bed, you put the \n     head on that pillow, leave your false teeth in your head, put \n     that conscience in that glass of salt water. Everybody'd be \n     better off. (Laughter, applause.)\n       Gaylord was the funniest stump speaker I ever heard, but \n     one night I saw him bested. Adlai Stevenson came to Madison \n     to speak to the Civil War Roundtable and he was about an hour \n     late afterwards, coming over to the old Park Hotel to talk to \n     the party faithful. Finally Gaylord dragged Governor \n     Stevenson and he went up to the mike, he said, ``I'm sorry \n     we're so late, so I'll give one of my typically \n     short speeches.'' Stevenson interrupted and said, ``I'll \n     give one of my typically long ones.'' (Laughter.) Gaylord \n     said, ``You do and I'll leave without you.'' Stevenson \n     said, ``Go ahead, see who the crowd follows.'' It's the \n     only time I saw Gaylord one-upped, except by Carrie Lee. \n     (Laughter.)\n       Gaylord was incredibly fortunate in his choice of a life's \n     mate. She was strong, and dedicated, and devoted to him, and \n     gave him strength. And the care that she gave him in the last \n     months of his life was truly wonderful. Gaylord was fiercely \n     proud of her. He said she could smell a phony, even from \n     upwind, faster than anybody he ever knew. (Laughter.) \n     Gaylord's friend, Scotty Reston, from the New York Times, \n     said once, or he wrote once, ``if not deflated once a week by \n     a loving wife, members of Congress come to believe that they \n     are what they merely represent.'' Gaylord never had to worry \n     about getting a big head as long as Carrie Lee was around. \n     When she was asked by the press what was the secret of her \n     long marriage, she said, ``It's very simple, we were both in \n     love with the same man. (Laughter, applause.)\n       But Gaylord's favorite story about Carrie Lee occurred when \n     Gaylord worked in this building in the State Senate. He was \n     leaving one night and as he was walking out of the Capitol he \n     ran into Governor Rennebohm, who was a fairly starchy fellow. \n     And the Governor said, ``Gaylord, would you mind coming over \n     with me to the Madison Club? There are a few things I'd like \n     to talk to you about.'' And Gaylord said, ``Oh Governor, I'd \n     love to but I haven't been home a single night this week. My \n     wife will kill me if I don't get home.'' And he said, ``let \n     me take''--the Governor said, ``let me take care of that. You \n     just dial home.'' So Gaylord dialed home, gave the receiver \n     to the Governor. When Carrie Lee picked up the phone, \n     Rennebohm said, ``Mrs. Nelson, this is Governor Rennebohm. I \n     wonder if you'd mind if Gaylord stayed downtown for an hour \n     or so to talk over some business with me.'' Carrie Lee \n     responded, ``Governor Rennebohm, my . . . (laughter) \n     patootie.'' (Laughter.) Only she didn't say ``patootie.'' \n     (Laughter.) Then, she says, ``Whoever this is, you tell that \n     hot shot to get his tail home now.'' (Laughter, applause.) \n     The Governor handed the phone to Gaylord and said, ``My, you \n     have an interesting wife.'' (Laughter.) He did, he did, and \n     he had an interesting life.\n       So Carrie Lee, Happy, Jeff, and Tia, we all thank you for \n     giving up so much so that you could share him with us. Your \n     sacrifice helped make Gaylord the greatest postwar leader in \n     Wisconsin history and next to Bob La Follette himself, the \n     greatest political leader Wisconsin has ever produced. \n     Gaylord Nelson was the best and the sweetest man in politics \n     that I've ever known. God knows I loved him, we all did. \n     That's why we're here, that's why we will miss him so much. \n     If he could say one thing to all of us today, I think it \n     would simply be: carry on, don't ever give up the fight. \n     (Applause.)\n       William H. Meadows: Walter F. Mondale's friendship with \n     Gaylord Nelson dates to the early 1960s when Mr. Mondale was \n     Minnesota's Attorney General and Gaylord Nelson was governor \n     and a candidate for the Senate. In 1964, he joined Gaylord in \n     the Senate and they served together until 1976 when he was \n     elected Vice President of the United States on the ticket \n     with President Carter. In 1984, Walter Mondale was the \n     Democratic candidate for president and from 1993-1997, served \n     under President Clinton as U.S. Ambassador to Japan. He has \n     promised at least one Norwegian joke today. (Laughter.) Vice \n     President Mondale. (Applause.)\n       Vice President Walter Mondale: Thank you, Carrie Lee, Tia, \n     Happy, Jeff, and all of the Nelsons. In all of my life, I \n     never had a better friend than Gaylord Nelson. But that's\n\n[[Page S8482]]\n\n     the way he was. He made friends everywhere. He was the best-\n     liked member of the U.S. Senate, on both sides of the aisle. \n     The other day, Tommy Hinme wrote, he said, ``I have thought \n     and thought. No single person has brought greater joy to my \n     life than Gaylord.'' He had the best staff on the Hill, \n     everybody wanted to work for him. And over his career, \n     Gaylord inspired generations of public and environmental \n     leaders, like Dave Obey, many of whom make up this wonderful \n     crowd here this afternoon. I knew Gaylord well, he had guts, \n     he was real, he was what you saw.\n       In the Senate, Gaylord and I often talked as the Vietnam \n     War was gathering. He opposed it from the start and he did so \n     long before it was politically safe to do so. He famously \n     voted against the war with only two other colleagues in the \n     Senate, saying that he needed his conscience more than Lyndon \n     needed his vote. Despite heavy pressure and bad polls, I \n     never saw him flinch once. He put his career on the line.\n       When you've been in public life as long as some of us, you \n     begin to judge public leaders more skeptically. You've seen \n     the posers, the pious, the trimmers, the vain, but at the \n     same time you can begin to recognize the few who run their \n     course with such courage and honesty and decency that you are \n     doubly inspired by their example of what is possible. And \n     that was Gaylord Nelson. He had the vision. He believed in \n     education, he had been given his chance, now others should \n     have theirs. He believed in justice and civil rights and \n     fought for all the civil rights acts. He believed in \n     opportunity and chaired the committee that originated Head \n     Start, Legal Services, and the Child and Family Services Act.\n       And of course we can't talk about Gaylord without Carrie \n     Lee. They pulled it off together. In a marriage even \n     celebrated in Brokaw's book The Greatest Generation, Carrie \n     Lee was a great hostess, she was a great cook, she was a \n     friend to everybody, and for as long as I can remember they \n     would gather their friends together to have a good time and \n     strengthen the bonds between us. Joan and I attended several \n     of those events, including the famous 50th wedding \n     anniversary where Carrie Lee pointed out that they loved the \n     same man. It was that same night, and here's the Norwegian \n     joke, (laughter), that Gaylord stood up and told the freshest \n     of Norwegian jokes and that is that he loved Carrie Lee for \n     so long that he had almost told her. (Laughter, applause.) Of \n     course, the rest is history.\n       Gaylord did more to protect America's natural beauty and \n     wildlife, to halt the corruption of our air and our water and \n     the earth than any one single person in American history. \n     Beginning in Wisconsin, in the Congress, and later in The \n     Wilderness Society until his last breath. So his most \n     priceless legacy is to be found in the protected national \n     beauty saved for future Americans.\n       When Carrie Lee called Joan and me, telling us that Gaylord \n     was gone, we were at our place out near Scandia, overlooking \n     the St. Croix River just south of Osceola. And as we heard \n     this message about our dearest friend, we were looking at \n     this wonderful river and this wonderful valley that is \n     protected forever because of him. All over the country, that \n     is true of Gaylord, of his vision, and what he left for all \n     of us. So Gaylord's place in our hearts and our nation's \n     history is now assured, you can feel it here today.\n       But what he found so disturbing and what he talked so much \n     about in later years, is that so much of what he accomplished \n     is now under scandalous attack today. So if he were here \n     today, I think he would want us to honor him most by renewing \n     his great fight to preserve our nation's majesty and beauty. \n     (Applause.)\n       Shakespeare once wrote that a good heart is the sun and the \n     moon, or rather the sun, and not the moon, for it shines \n     bright, never changes, but keeps it course truly. That's \n     Gaylord. Over his long and wonderful life, he did shine \n     bright and he surely kept his course truly. Gaylord, we will \n     always remember you and we love you. (Applause.)\n       William H. Meadows: Governor Jim Doyle is someone who has \n     known Gaylord Nelson his entire life. His parents, James and \n     Ruth Doyle were contemporaries of Gaylord and were among \n     those who worked with him to organize the modern Democratic \n     Party of Wisconsin. Jim Doyle is a former Dane County \n     District Attorney who was elected Attorney General in 1990 \n     and served three terms. He was elected governor of Wisconsin \n     in 2002. Governor Doyle. (Applause.)\n       Gov. Jim Doyle: Well to Carrie Lee, Happy, Tia, Jeff, to \n     all of the members of the Nelson family, to the governors of \n     the State of Wisconsin who have assembled here, to our \n     current United States Senators, many from other states who \n     have traveled to Wisconsin for this occasion, certainly \n     Senators Kohl and Feingold, of course to Vice President \n     Mondale--I remember the great rally we had a few years ago \n     just outside the Capitol here with the Vice President--to all \n     the members of Congress, and to all the citizens of \n     Wisconsin.\n       We are here to celebrate the life of Wisconsin's favorite \n     son. And at the same time, like many of you, not only is this \n     a great public person but we are also here to acknowledge, to \n     my family, the loss of a dear and treasured friend. There was \n     never a time in my life that I didn't know Gaylord Nelson. I \n     grew up in a home in which he and Carrie Lee and the whole \n     other rest of the gang were often present with their \n     highballs, as they called them in those days. But I also grew \n     up in a home in which Gaylord and Carrie Lee were deeply \n     revered. He is one of my parents' closest friends. Gaylord \n     Nelson was elected to the Wisconsin Legislature in 1948, the \n     same time my mother was elected to the Legislature and in \n     that same year, a young representative from Prairie du Chien, \n     Pat Lucey, was elected to the Wisconsin Legislature. Gaylord \n     and Carrie Lee are the greatest of the greatest generation. \n     They fought to preserve the world's freedom in World War II \n     and then, together with a group of committed people, they \n     returned to Wisconsin, intent on making this state, this \n     nation, and this world a better place. They organized and \n     built the Democratic party.\n       And with Gaylord and Carrie Lee's wisdom, energy, humor at \n     the center, these people were not only close political \n     allies, they were the closest of friends, almost family. And \n     to my great benefit, Gaylord and Carrie Lee reached out to \n     bring the next generation into that circle of warmth and \n     friendship. Gaylord Nelson was sworn in as governor of the \n     State of Wisconsin in this very spot 46 years ago. His public \n     career as a legislator, governor, and United States senator \n     has been an inspiration to so many who've come after.\n       Gaylord Nelson didn't enter politics for notoriety, he \n     entered politics to make a difference. Early in his career, \n     he was concerned that Bob La Follette would have solved all \n     of the problems of the state and the country by the time he \n     came along. But he found, when elected governor, that there \n     were still a few more problems to work on. He was a tough, \n     effective, and practical politician. He knew when \n     to compromise and he knew when to stand on principle. He \n     fought over some issues that, with the passage of years, \n     when you look back, may seem somewhat small and trivial. \n     But truly, as Dave Obey noted, Gaylord's genius was that \n     he was able to identify the enduring values and to focus \n     on the issues that were most fundamental to this state, \n     nation, and world. He brought basic Clear Lake, Wisconsin \n     values to the positions he held. In World War II, he was \n     one of four white officers in charge of an all black \n     company. He was outraged that these men were risking their \n     lives for a country in which they couldn't share a meal \n     with him in public. So when he became state senator, one \n     of the first pieces of legislation he introduced was to \n     integrate the Wisconsin National Guard. (Applause.) And \n     later, when President Kennedy sent Congress the most \n     comprehensive, far-reaching civil rights bill ever \n     proposed, Gaylord Nelson was first to sign on as a co-\n     sponsor. (Applause.)\n       He made deep friendships across political aisles. I was so \n     deeply honored when I was sworn in as governor at this place \n     that Gaylord Nelson and Melvin Laird came together to my \n     inauguration. And Melvin Laird, whose great words we heard \n     recently--just a few moments ago--who happens to be the uncle \n     of the First Lady of Wisconsin, to show you that all things \n     do come around in a full circle, (laughter), called us \n     immediately upon hearing of Gaylord's passing to express his, \n     great sorrow and his great desire to be here today.\n       Gaylord Nelson understood that principle was more important \n     than partisanship and he always put the public good ahead of \n     personal political gain. Perhaps that's why he was one of \n     just three senators, as we've heard, to vote against the \n     Vietnam War. He came under enormous pressure to vote yes for \n     the sake of solidarity with his president and his party, but \n     in the end Gaylord Nelson wouldn't budge. He said that the \n     Senate needed his vote far less than he needed his own \n     conscience. I remember deeply the advice he gave me when I \n     became governor. He said--and this is a difficult thing to \n     do, and I think the other governors here will acknowledge--he \n     said, ``Don't dwell on the day-to-day fights in the Capitol; \n     focus on what will really matter to people years and years \n     down the road.''\n       He ultimately once said that the ultimate test of man's \n     conscience is his willingness to sacrifice something today \n     for generations tomorrow, whose words of thanks will not be \n     heard. Of course it was this ethic that led him to become the \n     father of the modern environmental movement, to Earth Day, to \n     landmark legislation like the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts, \n     and to The Wilderness Society. In this building today, we are \n     fighting to preserve the Stewardship Fund, the result of his \n     vision 40 years ago. And every time we pour a glass of water, \n     breathe the air in our cities, swim in our lakes, enjoy the \n     beauty of Wisconsin's natural heritage, we ought to pause and \n     say thank you to Gaylord Nelson for all that he has given \n     each of us. (Applause.)\n       Perhaps the greatest measure of a person is not how he or \n     she handles success, but disappointment. In 1980, when he \n     lost his United States Senate seat, our family, like I \n     suspect most everyone else here who was around in those days, \n     was crushed. But Gaylord didn't seek anyone's sympathy and \n     believe me, if he had tried to, Carrie Lee wouldn't let it \n     happen. Instead he consoled those around him. He worried \n     about his staff finding jobs, he wanted to keep contributing, \n     and when he became chairman of The Wilderness Society, he \n     said that, if he had known that job was available, he just \n     might not have run for reelection in the first place. \n     (Laughter.)\n       And perhaps the most telling thing is this: Gaylord Nelson \n     lived nearly three-quarters of his life in the public eye in \n     a time of ever-increasing media skepticism, in a time of \n     distrust of government. Yet of all the Gaylord stories that \n     have been told and written, none of them, none of them are \n     negative. Of\n\n[[Page S8483]]\n\n     all the Gaylord Nelson stories, not one has ever questioned \n     his actions, his motivation, or his integrity. And now \n     Gaylord Nelson returns home to Clear Lake, Wisconsin for the \n     very last time. And a great American story will have come \n     full circle. The fourth child, born to Anton and Mary Nelson \n     rose to political stardom, called some of the most powerful \n     political leaders in Washington his friends, and launched a \n     lasting environmental movement. But, as some have said, \n     through it all he was just a boy from Clear Lake out on a \n     great adventure.\n       We loved Gaylord Nelson as a leader, a statesman, and a \n     friend. We loved him as a brother, a father, and a son. Love \n     is not an easy thing to put into words, neither is vision, \n     intelligence, courage, honesty, humor, and compassion. But he \n     was all of these. He was the most plainly decent man anyone \n     could ever hope to meet. And we are not so much proud that he \n     was one of us, but we are proud that we were one of his.\n       Robert Frost reminded us that in nature, nothing gold can \n     stay. Nevertheless, I know I speak for many of you when I \n     say: I wish I could see my friend just one more time.\n       And yet, in the vast acres of land now protected throughout \n     our state, Gaylord Nelson lives on. In the yearly \n     celebrations of Earth Day, joined by millions around the \n     world, Gaylord Nelson lives on. And in the breathtaking \n     beauty of the Apostle Islands, a symphony of nature, Gaylord \n     Nelson lives on. So today, let us pledge to ourselves, and \n     to each other, to keep his spirit alive not only in our \n     hearts but in our deeds. And so, as one of Governor \n     Nelson's successors as governor of this great state and on \n     behalf of a grateful state, we wish Governor, Senator \n     Gaylord Nelson farewell. (Applause.)\n       Thank you. Gaylord Nelson lives on in many other ways, but \n     certainly in his children: Happy, Tia, Jeff, and his \n     grandchildren. And with Tia, there has been a proud successor \n     to the Nelson environmental legacy. In her work at Nature \n     Conservancy, and now here in the State of Wisconsin with the \n     Board of Public Lands, Tia Nelson has been truly her father's \n     daughter. We are so pleased to welcome here today Tia Nelson. \n     (Applause.)\n       Tia Nelson: Good afternoon everyone, thank you so much. On \n     behalf of our entire family, my mother, my brothers Jeff and \n     Happy, our thanks to Governor Doyle and his staff for all \n     their kindness and compassion and hard work. They've done \n     such a beautiful job in bringing this together, we are so \n     very grateful. Thanks to Dave Obey, Fritz Mondale, and Bill \n     Meadows, all dear, dear friends of long standing. While we \n     regret that Mel Laird couldn't be here in person, we are \n     grateful that Tom Petri was willing to take time away from \n     his business in Washington to read Mel's remarks for him. \n     Tom, you're a class act, too.\n       Anyone who knows my father also knows that if he were here \n     now, you would be laughing within a few minutes. He was such \n     a raconteur. Now if Bill Meadows and I had exchanged notes \n     before this, I would have told him that he couldn't use that \n     word, but Papa liked it, as he loved the language. He was an \n     extraordinary speaker and he often was speaking off the cuff, \n     off the envelope sometimes, off a napkin he would scribble \n     notes on, and he always left you laughing. He once said a \n     good speech was one that includes an interesting subject, is \n     not too long, and has a good laugh two or three times. Well, \n     if that's the standard, Papa far surpassed it. He didn't \n     always even need an interesting subject, but he always gave \n     you a few good laughs.\n       When I visited him in March, he had begun to decline \n     quickly and he had, at 88 years of age, finally stopped going \n     to work at The Wilderness Society. If you knew him, you knew \n     that was a bad sign. I left D.C. that day without knowing \n     whether I would see him again. I wrote in my journal that \n     evening, flying home to Madison, I knew only the first words, \n     the same first words my brothers were thinking: I am the \n     luckiest child in the world. From my mother and my father, we \n     have received so many gifts: humor; kindness; the beauty of \n     their enduring, unconditional love; a commitment to making a \n     difference, however big or small; and so much more. While \n     Papa was so many people's hero, he was also a superhuman \n     figure to some and he was my brothers' and my hero too. And \n     for this we count our blessings. It's an unearned gift, you \n     know, kind of like winning the lottery with a multi-year \n     payout: you did nothing to deserve it and it pays you all \n     your life. In my case I didn't even have to buy the ticket. \n     (Laughter.)\n       I remember struggling in school, then I'm diagnosed with \n     dyslexia. Papa managed to coax me, bribe me really, to learn \n     to love the language the way he did, a nickel for every word \n     my brothers and I could learn and use in a sentence. \n     ``Proclivity,'' ``propensity,'' ``penchant'' were my \n     favorite--what fun we had coaxing the subtle differences from \n     each. My father said to me over and over again, ``Never be \n     afraid to say, `I don't know.''' Once, while in college, he \n     sent me a clipping, a series of photos of Albert Einstein. \n     There was a caption under each photo. One said, ``Einstein \n     never hesitated to say `I don't know.''' Papa circled those \n     words and he drew an arrow off into the corner: ``See, even \n     Albert Einstein and Gaylord Nelson say it.'' (Laughter.) Not \n     knowing the answer was okay to him, but not asking the \n     question was unacceptable. His lessons were so very many and \n     so very rich and it didn't seem that he was really working at \n     it all that hard. Those lessons came naturally, almost by \n     osmosis.\n       The demands of public life meant he wasn't around much to \n     help my mother but I didn't really notice that until later in \n     life. I just reveled in their love and their humor and their \n     intelligent debate. When I last visited, he asked me about my \n     work, my new job at the Board of Commissioners of Public \n     Lands. I told him about our plans to consolidate our land \n     holdings and improve our management efficiency and so on. He \n     asked me if I had any Republican support. I told him I did. \n     Which was true at the time. (Laughter, applause.) You know, \n     he'd never miss an occasion to give you a message, never. To \n     honor him, I must do the same. Certainly, neither he nor his \n     successor as governor, Republican Warren Knowles, ever \n     thought the stewardship of Wisconsin's extraordinary \n     resources was a partisan issue and has a long history of not \n     being one. I hope we get back to that soon. (Applause.)\n       I won't stop missing the days in which we would talk after \n     work and discuss whatever it was I was working on that day. I \n     was so grateful to receive his wise counsel, for the way he'd \n     poke holes in weak arguments, suggest strategies, always \n     encourage me to do more, to do better, to get the job done. \n     This is how he lived his life. When people asked why he kept \n     going to work at The Wilderness Society at age 88, he said, \n     ``There's more to do, the job's not done.''\n       He worked hard but he played hard too. As a student, he was \n     adequate. (Laughter.) He could have done better academically, \n     or so we suppose, but he had a wide range of other interests. \n     He was able to calculate just how much effort he needed to \n     expend to get passing grades. At UW Law School he had it down \n     to a very precise science. If it took a 76 to pass, he would \n     study enough to get a 77, leaving time for other pursuits. \n     One fall, he and two classmates who became his two best and \n     longest friends, Miles McMillan and John Lawton, two brave, \n     distinguished Wisconsinites, both of whom are now gone too--\n     they'd spent way too much time away from class that semester \n     because they volunteered to campaign for young Bob La \n     Follette's reelection to the Senate. As a result, Papa didn't \n     take some of his exams that semester. He ended up short a few \n     credits and to make up for it he signed up for a extra heavy \n     load the second semester. He soon learned he needed the \n     Dean's approval to do that. The Dean said to him, ``You're \n     barely passing your courses now. How do you think you can \n     possibly take more credits and pass them?'' And Papa said, \n     ``I can just as successfully not study 20 credits as I can \n     not study 15.'' (Laughter, applause.) The Dean agreed to let \n     him try and he passed them all, barely, as usual. Later in \n     life, Dean Lloyd Garrison told Papa, ``That was the best \n     legal argument you made.'' (Laughter) Professor Paige, from \n     the U.W. Law School, certainly would have agreed. He once \n     said to Papa after a less than impressive answer to one of \n     the professor's questions, ``Mr. Nelson, pick up your books, \n     go out that door, and down Bascom Hill, go to the music \n     school. You might make a piccolo player but you'll never make \n     a lawyer.'' (Laughter.) Lucky for us, Papa did not follow \n     Professor Paige's advice.\n       And on that note, I would like to end with a smile and a \n     chuckle, just the way Papa would have wanted it and invite \n     all of you to come down to Monona Terrace for a coffee and a \n     cookie with my family. Thank you very much. (Applause.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/19/senate-section/article/S8483-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8483-S8485]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO CONGRESSMAN PETER W. RODINO, JR.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, on May 7, former Congressman Peter W. \nRodino, Jr. died at his home in West Orange, NJ, at the age of 95. At \nthe time of his death he was professor emeritus at the Seton Hall \nUniversity School of Law, where he had continued to lecture until just \na few months ago. He was first elected to the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives from New Jersey's 10th congressional district in 1948 \nand went on to serve 20 terms, retiring in 1989. Throughout his long \ncareer he faithfully served the people of his district, and our Nation. \nIt was my great privilege to serve on the House Committee on the \nJudiciary under his chairmanship, and I shall remember him always as \n``Chairman.''\n  In the Congress, Peter Rodino served on the House Committee on the \nJudiciary for 24 years before becoming its chairman, quite \nunexpectedly, in 1973. At just that time it fell to the Judiciary \nCommittee to determine whether the President had acted in violation of \nfundamental principles of our Constitution and, if so, to undertake the \nfirst step in the impeachment procedures that the Constitution sets \nout. No one understood better than Peter Rodino the magnitude of the \nchallenge. It was, he often said, an ``awesome responsibility.''\n  As a very junior Member of the House of Representatives, just \nbeginning my second term, it was my great responsibility to serve on \nthe Judiciary Committee under Chairman Rodino during the impeachment \ninquiry. In a speech on the floor of the House in February, 1974, he \nset the tone for the\n\n[[Page S8484]]\n\nwork the committee was about to undertake: ``Whatever the result, \nwhatever we learn or conclude, let us now proceed with such care and \ndecency and thoroughness and honor that the vast majority of American \npeople, and their children after them, will say: `That was the right \ncourse. There was no other way.' ''\n  Chairman Rodino held the committee to those standards. As Michael T. \nKaufman wrote in the New York Times on May 9, he proceeded with ``great \npatience, caution, enormous energy, and fairness above all.'' In his \nrole as chairman, Peter Rodino saw himself as ``teacher, negotiator, \nleader and symbol,'' striving to achieve ``a spirit of fairness and \nbipartisanship.'' In this he was successful: members of the committee \ndrew together over the course of the inquiry, approving three articles \nof impeachment on strong bipartisan votes and, ultimately, reaching \nunanimity on the need to move the impeachment process forward.\n  Of his service during the impeachment inquiry, Chairman Rodino told \nhis biographer, Gerald Pomper, ``I was just the same Peter Rodino I've \nbeen all the time from the very first day I came to the Congress.'' \nIndeed he was. Throughout his years in the Congress he worked hard, and \nhe brought to his work both a bright and hopeful vision for our country \nand great skill as a legislator. His legislative achievements were \nremarkable: major contributions to the great Civil Rights Acts of the \n1960s--he served as floor manager of the Civil Rights Act of 1966; \npassage of landmark fair housing and fair-employment practices \nlegislation; immigration reform that overturned the decades-old system \nof rigid, country-based quotas. Later he wrote the Voting Rights \nExtension Act of 1982, and he played a leading role in establishing a \nnational holiday in honor of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.\n  It can be said of Peter Rodino that in his life he embraced the \nAmerican experience in the 20th century. The child of Italian \nimmigrants, born and raised in the Little Italy neighborhood in Newark, \nNJ, he earned his law degree over a period of 10 years by working days \nand taking classes at night. Well before Pearl Harbor and the U.S. \nentry into World War II, he enlisted in the U.S. Army, served in the \nNorth African and Italian campaigns, received one of the first \nbattlefield commissions, was awarded the Bronze Star, and retired with \nthe rank of captain. Upon leaving the Army, he entered the Congress; \nupon retiring from the Congress, he joined the faculty of the Seton \nHall Law School. There he remained until his death, attentive to the \nend to his students and colleagues. He believed in our democratic \ninstitutions and their capacity to improve the lives of our people. \n``There was not a single day of his professional life,'' according to \nthe Dean of Seton Hall Law School, ``when he didn't carry a copy of the \nConstitution in his pocket.'' The country will forever be grateful to \nhim.\n  Chairman Rodino was remembered by his family, friends, colleagues at \nSeton Hall Law School and former colleagues in the U.S. House of \nRepresentative in a very moving ceremony at St. Lucy Church, Newark NJ, \non May 16, 2005. I ask unanimous consent that the homily of the \nReverend Nicholas S. Gengaro, Chaplain of the Seton Hall Law School, \nand the eulogy delivered by Paula A. Franzese, Peter W. Rodino at the \nSeton Hall Law School, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               Homily of the Reverend Nicholas S. Gengaro\n\n\n  FUNERAL MASS, THE HONORABLE PETER W. RODINO, JR., ST. LUCY CHURCH, \n                     MONDAY, MAY 16, 2005, 11:00 AM\n\n       Readings: Wisdom--3:1-9; Romans--8:14-23; Matthew--5:1-12a.\n       The NBC television network will be pleased to hear me claim \n     a place among the fans of its award-winning weekly drama \n     series, The West Wing. I confess that I am drawn in by the \n     promise of a walk down the corridors of power, an ear inside \n     decision-making at the highest level, a look at how things \n     get done in our country, our world. Of course, the show is \n     fiction, but the writers purposely dramatize current events \n     and issues.\n       In an episode this spring, one of the characters running \n     for election to the presidency rebelled against pressure from \n     religious groups to disclose his religious beliefs and \n     practices. ``If the American people begin to insist on \n     knowing where and how often their leaders worship God,'' he \n     declares, ``then, they are begging to be lied to.'' Religion \n     and politics are a volatile mix. Since 1998, when I became \n     chaplain at Seton Hall School of Law, I have had the \n     privilege of knowing the Honorable Peter W. Rodino, Jr. \n     The first time I attended the annual Rodino Law Society \n     Dinner, I spotted the Congressman in the crowd and \n     wrestled down my shyness to walk over and introduce \n     myself. Not only was I aware of the heroic role he had \n     played in our nation's history, but I remembered hearing \n     about him from my childhood, his name spoken by proud \n     Italian American relatives who had been helped personally \n     by him. To me he was a national icon, but also a bit of a \n     ``household god,'' patron of the good name and self-\n     respect of the vast number of Americans whose surnames end \n     in a vowel.\n       That initial conversation lasted nearly an hour. \n     Congressman Rodino remembered my great uncle who ran a \n     business right outside St. Lucy's Church, here at 7th Avenue \n     and Cutler Street. I was to discover over the years that \n     Peter Rodino remembered everything. Young in his nineties, \n     the Congressman could quote statesmen, historians, poets, \n     even song lyrics--sometimes in another language. But most of \n     all he remembered people.\n       In 1977, at the unveiling of the portrait of Congressman \n     Rodino that hangs in the chamber of the House Judiciary \n     Committee, Vice President Walter Mondale suggested that Peter \n     Rodino's ``life has stood and stands for `the love of country \n     and the love of freedom kept pure by the tenderest humanity \n     for all mankind' '' (Proceedings Before the Committee on the \n     Judiciary, May 12, 1977, 95th Congress, 1st Session, House \n     Document 95-307, p.8).\n       In other words, Congressman Rodino regarded his career in \n     public service as a labor of love. He often quoted Thomas \n     Paine's axiom ``for those who would enjoy the fruits of \n     liberty, they must first undergo the fatigue of supporting \n     it'' (Address to the Trial Lawyers Association of New Jersey, \n     2002). As a little boy the Congressman once stood next to his \n     mother listening to the music of the band at a religious \n     festival. He began to wave his hands as if to conduct the \n     band, and continued to do so with glee for song after song. \n     ``Someday you will be a leader of men!'' his mother told him. \n     Peter Rodino, Sr., would remind his son of these words many \n     years later.\n       Fr. Timothy Healy, President of Georgetown University, \n     shortly after the events of Watergate had run their course, \n     arrived at the heart of the matter when he said of \n     Congressman Rodino, ``It took our time of trouble to show us \n     what he really is. As this nation rocked in shame, all of us \n     watched Chairman Rodino manage our destiny. We came to know \n     his calmness, his strength, his sense of order. We grew to \n     trust his honesty. We watched the citizen-politician at work, \n     and as we watched, we rediscovered in him the best of \n     ourselves and of this Nation. Through long and bitter hours, \n     to millions of Americans, Peter Rodino was America.'' Fr. \n     Healy concluded, ``We have seen a just man doing justice'' \n     (Proceedings Before the Committee on the Judiciary, May 12, \n     1977, 95th Congress, 1st Session, House Document 95-307, pp. \n     1-2).\n       Is Peter W. Rodino, Jr., a saint? To the countless marks of \n     distinction awarded him in this life--honorary degrees, \n     orders of knighthood, eponymous institutes and chairs of \n     learning--can we suppose him now to be also one of the elect \n     in heaven? Of course, to God alone belongs such a judgment. \n     Yet the Scripture proclaimed in this Mass of Resurrection \n     clearly indicates, ``The souls of the just are in the hand of \n     God.'' The Book of Wisdom explains, ``As gold in the furnace, \n     he proved them.'' The Letter of Paul to the Romans echoes, \n     ``The Spirit itself bears witness with our spirit that we are \n     children of God, and if children then heirs, heirs of God and \n     joint heirs with Christ, if only we suffer with him, so that \n     we may also be glorified with him.''\n       Congressman Rodino told me that he kept two texts next to \n     his bed: the Bible and the Constitution of the United States \n     of America. In a speech just this past October, he called the \n     52 words of the Preamble his ``guiding light'' (Rodino Law \n     Society Dinner, October 27, 2004). He was passionate about \n     the imperative found there ``to secure the Blessings of \n     Liberty.'' ``The Blessings of Liberty'' was a favorite theme \n     of his. The word ``blessing'' was as important to him as the \n     word ``liberty.'' He firmly believed that the great nation of \n     the United States of America would lose its way if it ceased \n     to be aware that every good thing, and especially freedom, is \n     bestowed according to the providence of a higher power.\n       For this reason, in 1954, he was a sponsor of the \n     legislation which added the words ``under God'' to the Pledge \n     of Allegiance. ``We deliberately left the phrase short and \n     vague so as to offend no creed and embrace all possible \n     concepts of the higher power. The point is to preserve us \n     from arrogance,'' he explained to me.\n       Every day of his life, Congressman Rodino prayed the Prayer \n     of St. Francis of Assisi.\n\n     ``Lord, make me an instrument of your peace.\n     Where there is hatred, let me sow your love.\n     Where there is injury, pardon; doubt, faith; despair, hope; \n           darkness, light; sadness, joy.''\n\n       This prayer of the 13th century saint, co-patron of Italy, \n     is itself a reflection on Matthew's so-called ``Beatitudes'' \n     from Jesus' Sermon on the Mount. We heard the proclamation:\n\n\n[[Page S8485]]\n\n\n     ``Blessed are the poor in spirit . . .\n     they who mourn . . .\n     the meek . . .\n     they who hunger and thirst for righteous-\n           ness . . .\n     the merciful . . .\n     the clean of heart . . .\n     the peacemakers . . .\n     they who are persecuted for righteousness' sake. . . .''\n\n       Can we not see how the Honorable Peter Rodino implemented \n     these texts in his life? Is it an accident that countless \n     immigrants were given hope and a new start in a land of \n     opportunity because of legislation he sponsored to remove \n     unfair quotas? Is it a coincidence that this man of integrity \n     evolved to serve a new constituency in his district in the \n     1960s, that he became a champion of civil rights and voting \n     rights for all citizens regardless of race, color or creed, \n     identifying himself with the persecuted and those hungering \n     and thirsting for righteousness? Was he reciting St. Francis \n     to himself and remembering the Beatitudes when he took part \n     in disarmament conferences and the stability and security \n     efforts of the parliamentary arm of NATO? ``Make me an \n     instrument of your peace. . . .''\n       In his recent volume, Ordinary Heroes and American \n     Democracy, Gerald M. Pomper, in the chapter ``Peter Rodino: A \n     hero of the House,'' writes, ``Our concept of the democratic \n     hero looks for heroism among ordinary people doing their \n     customary work in the moments of crisis.'' He dubs Peter \n     Rodino a ``workhorse'' of the U.S. House of Representatives, \n     and reminds us of the messiness with which the work of \n     democracy proceeds in that body, by compromise, consensus-\n     building, careful and dexterous application of the rules.\n       I would like to suggest that Peter Rodino is also an \n     ordinary hero of his faith. Like the character in The West \n     Wing, he eschewed a flamboyant, pretentious, self-conscious \n     politician's instrumentalization of religious practice, which \n     threatens democracy with theocracy. Instead, to paraphrase \n     the prophet Micah, he knew the right, he did the right and he \n     walked humbly with his God.\n       The Catholic funeral liturgy is a celebration of hope. Four \n     days before his death, Congressman Rodino sat in his recliner \n     chair when I visited him. His breathing was labored and he \n     struggled to stay awake. At one point he forced his eyes wide \n     open and asked, ``What's the world situation?'' Sure I had \n     heard wrong, I began naming a number of comfort items I \n     supposed he was wanting: Water? Juice? Another blanket? ``Do \n     you want me to get Joy?'' I asked. ``The world!'' he \n     reiterated, certainly annoyed with my narrow focus on \n     conveniences. ``Tell me about the world. What's happening?'' \n     This man was not leaving this life, this world that had held \n     him in endless fascination, one moment sooner than he \n     absolutely had to.\n       Nor is he absent from us now. The Honorable Peter W. \n     Rodino, Jr., is heir to the promise made to all who are \n     baptized into Christ, of life unending with his Creator. May \n     his be the blessings of a liberty far greater than we now \n     know how to ask for or imagine. With St. Francis we conclude, \n     ``For it is in giving that we receive, it is in pardoning \n     that we are pardoned, and it is in dying that we are born to \n     eternal life.''\n\n       By Rev.

Rodino's Funeral \n                            on May 16, 2005)\n\n       The last words spoken to me by my beloved mentor and \n     friend, Cong. Peter W. Rodino, just days before his passing, \n     were: ``Keep that good heart.'' In those four words we find \n     the measure of the man and the magnitude of his legacy. Keep \n     that good heart, mindful that there will be many temptations \n     to do otherwise. This life can be a vessel of sadness, but \n     even in the face of all disenchantment and cynicism and \n     disappointment, still, keep that good heart.\n       Peter asked us to be relentless in our capacity to anchor \n     ourselves in love, in compassion, in humility, in virtue, no \n     matter the adversity, no matter the turmoil, no matter the \n     naysayers. We live in a world that finds itself preoccupied \n     with glamour and status and fortune and fame. Yet, here is \n     this iconic public figure, who walked with kings and held the \n     hand of a nation as he navigated the way out of a \n     constitutional crisis of unparalleled dimension, this \n     luminary and dignitary, this man of the House, who valued, \n     above all else, goodness of heart. He respected intelligence, \n     and he was brilliant, but he respected kindness even more.\n       And so it was, with great love, that this humble boy from \n     Newark, the son of a carpenter and the child of Italian \n     immigrants, moved mountains. His illustrious career in the \n     House of Representatives began in 1948, and spanned four \n     decades. Always, he ran on his own terms, never beholden to \n     anyone or anything. He sought public office as a politician \n     in the highest and best sense of the word. He was a champion \n     of the underdog, a spokesman for those without a voice. It \n     has been said that the principal cause of human suffering is \n     forgetfulness. Peter never forgot who he was, what he stood \n     for or where he came from.\n       John Henry Newman wrote, ``I sought to hear the voice of \n     God, and climbed the topmost steeple. But God declared, `Go \n     down again. I dwell among the people.' '' Peter Rodino heard \n     the voice of God in the voices of the people. And there, he \n     found the courage to do what needed to be done. He came to \n     the House to accomplish civil rights reform, to redress the \n     inequities of the nation's immigration laws and to promote \n     equal access to justice for all. And so he did.\n       Quietly, during a time when such an agenda for reform was \n     fiercely unpopular, he worked relentlessly, securing a seat \n     on the House Judiciary Committee and serving as a key \n     lieutenant whose work in the trenches, on the floor of the \n     House, helped to secure the passage of virtually every major \n     civil rights bill, including the watershed Civil Rights Act \n     of 1964. The Civil Rights Museum in Birmingham, Alabama \n     contains the historic photograph of President Lyndon B. \n     Johnson signing that landmark legislation into law, flanked \n     by the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. to his left and \n     Congressman Peter Rodino to his right.\n       Peter Rodino was a champion for the cause of civil rights \n     and civil liberties because he chose to be a man for all \n     people, irrespective of race, class, gender or ethnic origin. \n     It is no accident that, until his last days on Earth, he \n     carried in his pocket a tattered copy of the Preamble to the \n     U.S. Constitution. The Preamble begins with the words, ``We \n     the people.'' It holds out the promise that the blessings of \n     liberty belong not just to some of us, but to all of us.\n       And so it was that this great patriot had a date with \n     destiny. In 1974, as a country on the brink of a \n     constitutional impasse waited, and this fourteen year old sat \n     transfixed in front of the TV set, the Watergate hearings \n     began, and we found a hero. In Peter Rodino, humility met \n     preparation, and that boy from Barringer High School, who had \n     dedicated a lifetime to the cause of fundamental fairness and \n     equal justice under law, accepted the challenge.\n       We watched as the gentleman from Newark, carrying the \n     weight of a nation's suffering on his shoulders, stood firm \n     and dignified and tall, never wavering from his reverence for \n     the office of the presidency and never departing from his \n     conviction that our great democracy would withstand, indeed, \n     transcend, this greatest test.\n       Because of him, it did. And because of him, we did. In the \n     process, Peter Rodino gave us all something that we so \n     desperately needed. He gave us hope. Timothy White wrote, \n     ``Historically, certain figures emerge from despairing \n     cultures to reinterpret old symbols and beliefs and invest \n     them with new meaning. An individual's decision to play such \n     a role may be purely unconscious, but it can sometimes evolve \n     into an acute awareness that he or she may indeed have the \n     gift, as well as the burden, of prophecy.'' Peter Rodino was \n     such a figure. Sen. Ted Kennedy, in sending his condolences, \n     said: ``Many of us felt as we watched the Watergate hearings \n     that we were seeing a founding father in action, living the \n     highest ideals of the Constitution. I'm sure my brother would \n     have called him a profile in courage. I feel the same way, \n     and I'll never forget him.''\n       When all is said and done, none of us will ever forget \n     Peter Rodino, because of the way that he made us feel. His \n     life bears living witness to the greatness of our nation. His \n     story reminds us that we live in a world of infinite \n     possibilities, and that there is a force that meets good with \n     good. We watched, and we knew. Here was a gifted leader who \n     was, first and foremost, a good person. It is a testament to \n     the man that, when the vote to impeach was rendered, rather \n     than grandstand or resort to petty partisanship, he retreated \n     to his private chambers and he wept. Always, he kept that \n     good heart.\n       Peter spoke to our community just months ago, at Seton Hall \n     Law School's Rodino Dinner, where he urged us all to live a \n     life that matters. What will matter, he said, is not your \n     success, but your significance; not what you bought but what \n     you built. Implicit in all that he stood for is the premise \n     that people can be mean and cruel and irresponsible, but it \n     is up to us to love them anyway. If you commit to goodness \n     and to compassionate honesty in a world fraught with too much \n     brutal honesty, you may be accused of insincerity or of \n     building pies in the sky. But commit to the virtuous path \n     anyway. And if you dare to believe in the majesty of your \n     dreams, so that you do what you can with what you have, your \n     heart may sometimes break. But a broken heart has more room.\n       Peter, today we bask in the glow of your magnificent heart. \n     And although our own hearts ache because your days on Earth \n     have come to an end, we know that the angels rejoiced as they \n     welcomed you home. We know that you must have received the \n     most extraordinary standing ovation of all time, amidst the \n     resounding cheers and the tears of joy, all proclaiming: \n     ``Well done, Mr. Chairman, well done.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/19/senate-section/article/S8485-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8485-S8486]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO FOX McKEITHEN\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, today I commemorate the life of \nLouisiana's late secretary of state Fox McKeithen. Fox passed away \nSaturday at only 58 years of age.\n  Born Walter Fox McKeithen in 1946, Fox was destined for a life in \npublic office. His father, John McKeithen, served as the Governor of \nLouisiana from 1964 to 1972. And Fox demonstrated his natural \nleadership ability at a young age, serving as senior class president \nand becoming a three-sport\n\n[[Page S8486]]\n\nLetterman at Caldwell Parish High School.\n  He received a bachelor's degree in history/social studies from \nLouisiana Tech University and then became a civics teacher and coach at \nCaldwell Parish High School. In addition to teaching and his career in \nstate office, Fox established three successful businesses in Caldwell \nParish.\n  In 1983, Fox began his long career as a public servant when he was \nelected to the Louisiana House of Representatives. He was elected \nsecretary of state in 1987, and he served in this capacity for five \nconsecutive terms, being elected to his fifth term in November 2003.\n  As secretary of state for nearly two decades, Fox showed great \ndedication and devotion to the State of Louisiana. One of his biggest \naccomplishments was successfully merging the department of voter \nregistration and the department which stored the voting machines, \nconsolidating them into one. This had not been done in Louisiana since \n1960.\n  Fox simplified the functions of the secretary of state's office. He \nadapted to the changing technologies that took place over his five \nterms and modernized the office through computerized voting terminals \nand archiving.\n  He was also responsible for the renovation of the State capitol \nbuilding in Baton Rouge. Fox took the lead in helping bring a building \nthat once was in shambles and abandoned back to its former stateliness \nand glory. Because of Fox's efforts, the capitol building gives all who \nvisit and work there a taste of Louisiana's political history.\n  Fox had a very colorful personality, a trait often described by so \nmany. His vivaciousness and energy for life drew people to him. Once, \nhe even broke out into song at a press conference.\n  Those who served with Fox knew his commitment to the office of \nsecretary of state. This was especially apparent in a 2004 election, \nwhen he delivered voting machines to New Orleans precincts himself, \nensuring that everyone was able to vote and averting a potential \ncrisis.\n  Fox was a friend to all, and the State of Louisiana will miss him \ndearly. He leaves behind a loving wife, Yvonne, and their four \nchildren, Marjorie Ann, Marianne May, Rebecca Ann, and John Jesse.\n  Fox and his family are in our prayers and thoughts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/19/senate-section/article/S8486-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8486]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   CONGRATULATING THE GARRETT FAMILY\n\n Mr. ISAKSON.

Mr. President, today I wish to honor and publicly \nacknowledge the 50th anniversary of Pollock, SD, a small community \nnestled on the eastern bluffs of the Missouri River marking the divide \nbetween eastern and western South Dakota.\n  Located in northern Campbell County, Pollock's history is a bit \ndifferent from most other South Dakota towns, due to its relocation in \nthe 1950s. The town was originally formed in the mid-1880s under the \nname LaGrace, having been named after Mrs. Grace Fisk of Huron, SD. The \ntown's name was changed to Pollock in 1901 to honor R.Y. Pollock, a \npioneer lay minister and respected citizen. Although the first town of \nPollock was platted in 1901, the present community was not established \nuntil 1955. Interestingly, ``new'' Pollock celebrates its 50th \nanniversary this year, yet 4 years ago, in 2001, residents commemorated \n``old'' Pollock's 100th anniversary.\n  The original town was actually a combination of two river towns, \nLaGrace and Vanderbilt. The cities merged in 1901 and many buildings \nfrom surrounding communities were brought in. As a result, Pollock grew \nrapidly, and within months boasted a post office, grocery store, flour \nand feed store, three saloons, a butcher, a blacksmith, a pool hall, a \nhardware store, and a printer.\n  Like most young communities in the Dakotas, Pollock was not without \nits share of tragedy and hardship. In August of 1911, a fire broke out, \ndestroying a large portion of the business district. Additionally, \n``old'' Pollock was prone to flooding, as Spring Creek often overflowed \nduring heavy rains. Still, despite these setbacks, Pollock's resilient \nresidents always rebounded and rebuilt, which is a testimony to South \nDakotans' legendary pioneer spirit.\n  Until the early 1950s, Pollock's history was very much like most \nother South Dakota towns; however, that drastically changed in 1952, \nwhen the Army Corps of Engineers informed residents of its decision to \nbuild a dam on the Missouri River near Pierre. Although Pierre and \nPollock are miles apart, the proposal also entailed flooding the entire \ntown of Pollock and converting it into Lake Pocasse. Soon after \nlearning of the Corps of Engineers' plan, residents formed the Pollock \nFlood Association, a committee designed to organize the public and help \nplan for the flood. The committee held a town meeting in January of \n1953, and residents unanimously decided to move the town to a new \nlocation, which they eventually determined would be the area referred \nto as ``the old golf course.'' In order to purchase the land, the \ncommunity created a non-profit corporation to buy and subdivide the \nproperty into individual lots. Subsequently, town members looked at a \nmap of the various plots, selected the site they wanted, and placed \ntheir desired lot number in an envelope. During the drawing, \nsurprisingly, there were only two or three instances of multiple \nfamilies choosing the same piece of land, and in those cases, a coin \nwas flipped to determine the lucky owner. The Corps of Engineers then \npurchased people's ``old'' Pollock property on behalf of the \ngovernment, and residents were given the opportunity to buy back their \nhouse for 12 cents to the dollar and move the building to the new site. \n``New'' Pollock's groundbreaking ceremony was held June 4, 1955, thus \nultimately marking the birth of present-day Pollock, SD.\n  Although transporting houses and other buildings was difficult, it \npaled in comparison to the railroad official's task of relocating the \nMinneapolis St. Paul and Sault Saint Marie Railroad, known as the Soo \nLine. The move involved constructing 5 miles of new grade and track, in \naddition to building a new engine house and relocating the depot. In \nmid-October of 1960, the task was complete and the first train arrived \nin Pollock to a large crowd of spectators. Despite the railroad's \npainstaking efforts to keep the trains accessible, its popularity began \nto decline shortly after the move. In 1987, the Soo Line route from \nAshley, ND, to Pollock was abandoned, and the track was removed in \n1988.\n  In 1956, E.L. MacKay founded the Pollock Pioneer, the town's first \nnewspaper. MacKay recorded the growth of the new community, and \nactually coined Pollock's motto, ``A city built on a hill cannot be \nhid,'' when he used it as a byline for an article. To this day, the \nPollock Pioneer continues to provide residents with accurate and \nreliable news coverage.\n  One of Pollock's notable attractions is its 60 acre City Park. \nDesigned by the South Dakota Department of Game, Fish & Parks, in \nconjunction with the U.S. Soil Conservation Service, the recreation \narea is situated between the town and the waterfront. Year after year, \nCity Park is host to countless family picnics and outdoor\n\n[[Page S8487]]\n\nactivities. The foliage throughout the park, as well as the entire \ntown, noticeably enhances the beauty of this frontier community. As a \nmatter of fact, 15,000 of Pollock's trees were planted in 1956 by local \nvolunteers. Fifty years after its founding, Pollock supports numerous \ntourist facilities, such as parks, camping sites, a beach, boat ramps, \nmotels, and bait shops.\n  Pollock is also home to DairiConcepts' cheese plant. Originally named \nthe Dakota Cheese Co., the plant was established by a group of local \nmen in 1960. On its very first day of production, the Dakota Cheese Co. \nproduced 1,350 pounds of cheddar cheese. Bought by Mid-America Dairymen \nin 1981, the plant, now called DairiConcepts, expanded to become \nPollock's leading employer, with over 85 employees. Every day, the \nfactory produces 62,000 pounds of mozzarella cheese.\n  In the five decades since its founding, Pollock has provided its \ncitizens with a rich and diverse atmosphere. Pollock's 300 proud \nresidents celebrate the town's 50th anniversary June 24-26, 2005, and \nit is with great honor that I share with my colleagues this community's \nunique past and wish them the best for a promising future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/19/senate-section/article/S8487-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8487]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/19/senate-section/article/S8487-2", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8487]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/19/senate-section/article/S8487-3", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8487]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREPORT ON THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY BLOCKING PROPERTY \n  OF CERTAIN PERSONS AND PROHIBITING THE IMPORTATION OF CERTAIN GOODS \nFROM LIBERIA THAT WAS ESTABLISHED IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 13348 ON JULY 22, \n                              2004--PM 18\n\n  The Presiding Officer laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. l622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nprior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President \npublishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a \nnotice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the \nanniversary date.

A bill to give effect to the original agreement entered into \nby the cities of Dallas, Texas, and Fort Worth, Texas, to build a \nsingle airport to provide for the commercial air transportation needs \nof the region, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, Senator Harkin and I are introducing the \nTrue Competition Act which will resolve a longstanding debate about the \nstatus of Dallas Love Field Airport. This is a critical issue for those \nof us from States that depend on access to the Nation's air \ntransportation network through hub airports in other States.\n  In the late 1960s the Federal Government expressed concern that it \nwas funding three airports very closely located to each other in the \nDallas/Fort Worth area. It asked the local communities to build a \nsingle major airport to serve the entire region. The cities of Dallas \nand Fort Worth, in consultation with the airlines serving the local \nairports, agreed to do so only under the condition that all three local \nairports be permanently closed to all commercial airline traffic. It \nwas this agreement that resulted in the construction of the Dallas/Fort \nWorth International Airport.\n  The legislation I propose today would return to the original intent \nof all the parties involved in the decision to build DFW International \nby closing Love Field to commercial air traffic. If enacted, \ncompetition at DFW will increase significantly. This will be good for \nconsumers and it will be good for communities that used DFW as their \naccess to the world.\n  The Federal statute that is central to this debate is the so-called \nWright amendment. This was a law enacted in 1979 that allowed Love \nField to stay\n\n[[Page S8490]]\n\nopen for limited service despite the desire of the local communities to \nhave it close. It was necessary because activist judges in Texas had \nruled against the local government's intent to consolidate all air \ntraffic at DFW.\n  Recently, legislation has been introduced that would completely \nreverse the agreement of the parties to limit Love Field to an airport \nserving short haul markets. This would return to the situation that was \nsupposed be corrected 30 years ago. The runways of Love Field and DFW \nare 8 miles apart. To have two major, federally funded airports so \nclose simply doesn't make sense.\n  Moreover, if flights are transferred from DFW to Love Field--as they \nsurely would be if the Wright amendment is repealed--there will be \nfewer connecting opportunities at DFW for passengers from outside the \nnorth Texas area.\n  I understand that Southwest Airlines is lobbying strongly for repeal \nof the Wright amendment. I want to make it clear that I have the \ngreatest respect for Southwest and consider myself a good customer. But \nSouthwest surely does not need the continued permanent home court \nadvantage that the courts gave them years ago. Southwest operates very \nsuccessfully at some of the most congested and high volume airports in \nthe country. They have the skill and the resources to compete against \nany carrier at any airport. If they moved their operations to DFW, \nconsumers and communities could have the best of all worlds--intense \nhead-to-head competition between carriers and even more opportunities \nto travel throughout the world.\n  It is time to resolve this controversy once and for all by returning \nto the original intent of the parties.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. OBAMA:\n  S. 1426. A bill to amend the Safe Drinking Water Act to reauthorize \nand extend provisions relating to contaminant prevention detection, and \nresponse; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Drinking \nWater Security Act of 2005.\n  This bill would reauthorize a portion of the Safe Drinking Water Act, \nfirst enacted in 2002, that instructs the Environmental Protection \nAgency, EPA, and the Centers for Disease Control to develop the tools \nneeded by American drinking water systems to detect and respond to the \nintroduction of biological, chemical, and radiological contaminants by \nterrorists. My bill also would require EPA to report on its progress in \ndeveloping and implementing these detection and response systems since \n2002.\n  Like most Americans, I want to rise in the morning, make some coffee, \nand take a shower without worrying if that water has somehow been \ntampered with overnight by terrorists. Safe drinking water is something \nwe traditionally have taken for granted in this country. This bill will \ncontinue the good work our scientists have been doing to monitor, \ndetect, and negate any chemical, biological, or radiological agents \nthat terrorists could introduce into our drinking water, should they \nmanage to get past our physical security measures. This bill would also \nhelp implement appropriate warning systems in the event of a terrorist \nattack on our water systems.\n  I do not want to be an alarmist. But, September 11 changed Americans' \nviews on the possibility of the improbable and turned our focus to \npreparedness. This bill is all about preparedness. It provides the \nauthorization and oversight needed to continue to develop those tests \nand responses so we can stay one step ahead of potential terrorists.\n  I hope all of my colleagues join me in supporting this commonsense \nbill and ensuring that our drinking water remains safe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/19/senate-section/article/S8490-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8490]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 201--DESIGNATING SEPTEMBER 14, 2005, AS ``NATIONAL \n               ATTENTION DEFICIT DISORDER AWARENESS DAY''\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL (for herself and Mr. Durbin) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 201\n\n       Whereas Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (also \n     known as AD/HD or ADD), is a chronic neurobiological \n     disorder, affecting both children and adults, that can \n     significantly interfere with an individual's ability to \n     regulate activity level, inhibit behavior, and attend to \n     tasks in developmentally appropriate ways;\n       Whereas AD/HD can cause devastating consequences, including \n     failure in school and the workplace, antisocial behavior, \n     encounters with the justice system, interpersonal \n     difficulties, and substance abuse;\n       Whereas AD/HD, the most extensively studied mental disorder \n     in children, affects an estimated 3 percent to 7 percent \n     (2,000,000) of young school-age children and an estimated 4 \n     percent (8,000,000) of adults across racial, ethnic, and \n     socioeconomic lines;\n       Whereas scientific studies clearly indicate that AD/HD runs \n     in families and suggest that genetic inheritance is an \n     important risk factor, with between 10 and 35 percent of \n     children with AD/HD having a first-degree relative with past \n     or present AD/HD, and with approximately 50 percent of \n     parents who had AD/HD having a child with the disorder;\n       Whereas despite the serious consequences that can manifest \n     in the family and life experiences of an individual with AD/\n     HD, studies indicate that less than 85 percent of adults with \n     the disorder are diagnosed and less than \\1/2\\ of children \n     and adults with the disorder are receiving treatment;\n       Whereas poor and minority communities are particularly \n     underserved by AD/HD resources;\n       Whereas the Surgeon General, the American Medical \n     Association (AMA), the American Psychiatric Association, the \n     American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP), \n     the American Psychological Association, the American Academy \n     of Pediatrics (AAP), the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention (CDC), and the National Institute of Mental \n     Health, among others, recognize the need for proper \n     diagnosis, education, and treatment of AD/HD;\n       Whereas the lack of public knowledge and understanding of \n     the disorder play a significant role in the overwhelming \n     numbers of undiagnosed and untreated cases of AD/HD, and the \n     dissemination of inaccurate, misleading information \n     contributes to the obstacles preventing diagnosis and \n     treatment of the disorder;\n       Whereas lack of knowledge, combined with the issue of \n     stigma associated with AD/HD, has a particularly detrimental \n     effect on the diagnosis and treatment of AD/HD;\n       Whereas there is a need to educate health care \n     professionals, employers, and educators about the disorder \n     and a need for well-trained mental health professionals \n     capable of conducting proper diagnosis and treatment \n     activities; and\n       Whereas studies by the National Institute of Mental Health \n     and others consistently reveal that through proper and \n     comprehensive diagnosis and treatment, the symptoms of AD/HD \n     can be substantially decreased and quality of life for the \n     individual can be improved: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates September 14, 2005, as ``National Attention \n     Deficit Disorder Awareness Day'';\n       (2) recognizes Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder \n     (AD/HD) as a major public health concern;\n       (3) encourages all people of the United States to find out \n     more about AD/HD and its supporting mental health services, \n     and to seek the appropriate treatment and support, if \n     necessary;\n       (4) expresses the sense of the Senate that the Federal \n     Government has a responsibility to09\n       (A) endeavor to raise public awareness about AD/HD; and\n       (B) continue to consider ways to improve access to, and the \n     quality of, mental health services dedicated to the purpose \n     of improving the quality of life for children and adults with \n     AD/HD; and\n       (5) calls on Federal, State and local administrators and \n     the people of the United States to observe the day with \n     appropriate programs and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/19/senate-section/article/S8490-2", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8490-S8491]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 202--URGING THE GOVERNMENT OF SUDAN AND THE SUDAN \nPEOPLE'S LIBERATION MOVEMENT/ARMY TO FULLY IMPLEMENT THE COMPREHENSIVE \n                   PEACE AGREEMENT OF JANUARY 9, 2005\n\n  Mr. FRIST (for himself, Mrs. Dole, and Mr. Lugar) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 202\n\n       Whereas the people of Sudan have been devastated by war for \n     all but 10 years since Sudan gained its independence in 1956;\n       Whereas the second civil war in Sudan between the \n     Government of Sudan in the north and the Sudan People's \n     Liberation Army in the south began in 1983 and lasted for \n     more than 20 years;\n       Whereas more than 2,000,000 people died and more than \n     4,000,000 people were internationally displaced or became \n     refugees as a direct or indirect result of the civil war in \n     Sudan;\n       Whereas the Government of Sudan and the Sudan People's \n     Liberation Movement/Army\n\n[[Page S8491]]\n\n     failed on numerous occasions to bring a peaceful and just end \n     to the civil war in Sudan throughout the 1990s;\n       Whereas, in September 2001, President George W. Bush \n     appointed former Senator John Danforth as Special Envoy for \n     Peace in Sudan to explore the potential of the United States \n     to become involved in searching for a just resolution to the \n     civil war in Sudan, and appointed Andrew Natsios, the \n     Administrator of the United States Agency for International \n     Development, as the Special Humanitarian Coordinator for \n     Sudan to enhance the delivery of assistance that could help \n     reduce the suffering of the people of Sudan;\n       Whereas, in July 2002, the Government of Sudan and the \n     Sudan People's Liberation Movement/Army reached the historic \n     Machakos Protocol, an agreement on the role of religion in \n     Sudan and the right to self-determination for the people of \n     southern Sudan;\n       Whereas, in October 2002, the Government of Sudan and the \n     Sudan People's Liberation Movement/Army signed a memorandum \n     of understanding that called for a cessation of hostilities \n     and unimpeded humanitarian access to all areas of Sudan;\n       Whereas peace talks continued throughout 2003, with \n     discussions focusing on wealth sharing and the control of 3 \n     contested areas of Sudan;\n       Whereas, on November 19, 2004, the Government of Sudan and \n     the Sudan People's Liberation Movement/Army signed a \n     declaration committing themselves to reach a final \n     comprehensive peace agreement by December 31, 2004, in the \n     context of a special session of the United Nations Security \n     Council;\n       Whereas, on November 19, 2004, the United Nations Security \n     Council unanimously adopted Security Council Resolution 1574, \n     which welcomed the commitment of the Government of Sudan and \n     the Sudan People's Liberation Movement/Army to reach an \n     agreement by the end of 2004, and highlighted the intention \n     of the international community to assist the people of Sudan \n     and support the implementation of a comprehensive peace \n     agreement;\n       Whereas the Government of Sudan and the Sudan People's \n     Liberation Movement/Army initialed the final elements of a \n     comprehensive peace agreement on December 31, 2004;\n       Whereas, on January 9, 2005, the Government of Sudan and \n     the Sudan People's Liberation Movement/Army formally signed \n     the Comprehensive Peace Agreement;\n       Whereas the Comprehensive Peace Agreement provides for a \n     new constitution, new arrangements for power sharing and \n     wealth sharing, and a 6-year interim period to be followed by \n     a referendum in southern Sudan so that the people of southern \n     Sudan can decide their political future;\n       Whereas the Comprehensive Peace Agreement provides for new \n     institutions to be created and a new Government of National \n     Unity to be installed in Sudan once the constitution is \n     ratified;\n       Wheras despite progress on reaching a peace agreement on \n     the North-South conflict there has been little progress to \n     end the ongoing conflict in the region of Darfur.\n       Whereas, after tens of thousands of civilians died due to a \n     targeted compaign of violence by the government of Khartoum, \n     Congress declared on July 22, 2004, that the atrocities in \n     Darfur were genocide, committed primarily by the Government \n     of Sudan and its allied Janjaweed militias;\n       Whereas, on September 9, 2004, Secretary of State Colin \n     Powell testified that ``genocide has been committed in \n     Darfur'';\n       Whereas, on June 30, 2005, President Bush confirmed that \n     ``the violence in Darfur region is clearly genocide [and] the \n     human cost is beyond calculation'';\n       Whereas the Comprehensive Peace Agreement provides a model \n     for the resolution of all conflicts in Sudan, including \n     Darfur, eastern Sudan, and elsewhere;\n       Whereas, on July 9, 2005, the 6-year interim period under \n     the Comprehensive Peace Agreement began with the formation of \n     a new transitional government and the signing of an interim \n     constitution, and Dr. John Garang, the Chairman of the Sudan \n     People's Liberation Movement/Army, was sworn in by President \n     Omar Hassan al Bashir as First Vice President of Sudan;\n       Whereas millions of the people across Sudan continue to \n     suffer from the effects of war, including displacement and \n     war-related disease, hunger, and malnutrition;\n       Whereas the people of southern Sudan are in desperate need \n     of reconstruction assistance to build and improve vital \n     infrastructure components that are nearly nonexistent in \n     southern Sudan;\n       Whereas, despite the historic signing of the Comprehensive \n     Peace Agreement in January 2005, the key to success will now \n     be the full and timely implementation of the agreement by all \n     sides, wholly consistent with the letter, spirit, and intent \n     of the agreement; and\n       Whereas the impact and efficacy of the Comprehensive Peace \n     Agreement will also be measured by the political resolution \n     of ongoing conflict in other parts of Sudan, including Darfur \n     and the east of Sudan: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commends the people of Sudan on the signing of the \n     historic Comprehensive Peace Agreement on January 9, 2005;\n       (2) urges the new Government of National Unity of Sudan, \n     consisting of elements of the National Congress Party and the \n     Sudan People's Liberation Movement/Army, to fully implement \n     the Comprehensive Peace Agreement in a timely manner \n     consistent with the letter, spirit, and intent of the \n     agreement;\n       (3) requests that the United States Government--\n       (A) commit to high-level, sustained engagement to closely \n     monitor the implementation of the Comprehensive Peace \n     Agreement and events on the ground in Sudan, including in \n     Darfur and elsewhere; and\n       (B) sustain pressure as appropriate to ensure the \n     Comprehensive Peace Agreement is implemented in a full, \n     timely, and thorough manner;\n       (4) urges the United States Government--\n       (A) to maintain sanctions on the Government of Sudan as \n     appropriate until the Comprehensive Peace Agreement has been \n     fully honored and implemented; and\n       (B) to renew efforts to implement additional sanctions \n     through the United Nations Security Council until peace in \n     Darfur is achieved and those responsible for genocide, war \n     crimes, crimes against humanity, and criminal acts are \n     brought to justice;\n       (5) strongly urges the Government of National Unity of \n     Sudan to use the Comprehensive Peace Agreement as the basis \n     for negotiation of a peaceful resolution of the conflicts in \n     Darfur and other areas of Sudan;\n       (6) strongly supports the expansion of the size and role of \n     the mission of the African Union in Darfur to protect \n     civilians in Darfur and encourages continued support for this \n     mission from the United States, the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization, and other countries and international \n     organizations;\n       (7) strongly supports the United Nations Mission in the \n     Sudan and the expansion of this mission to protect civilians \n     and aid workers throughout Sudan;\n       (8) supports the continued provision of humanitarian and \n     reconstruction assistance from the United States to the \n     people of southern Sudan, in addition to the assistance \n     allocated for the people of Darfur, so that the people of \n     Sudan may experience and appreciate the benefits of peace;\n       (9) supports international efforts to facilitate the safe \n     and voluntary return of refugees and internationally \n     displaced persons to their homes in Sudan; and\n       (10) calls upon the governments of all countries in the \n     Sudan region and around the world to actively support and \n     monitor the full implementation of the Comprehensive Peace \n     Agreement to help ensure that the people of Sudan pursue the \n     path to peace, prosperity, and security.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/19/senate-section/article/S8491-1", "month": "07",

Mr. President, if I could say a word before closure takes \nplace, I know the burden on the majority leader is significant. There \nis so much to do and so little time to do it. Through the Chair, I \nexpress my desire to the majority leader that we figure out a way--he \nfigure out a way--we can move to the DOD authorization bill at the \nearliest possible date. I think it is so important we do that.\n  I visited Walter Reed yesterday. It is important we set the right \ntone for those men and women fighting over there. Part of that would be \nto do the DOD authorization.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we have a lot to do in the next week and a \nhalf. DOD authorization, as the Democrat leader and as my colleagues \nknow, is a high priority. We also are doing our very best to come to an \nagreement on how to bring stem cells to the floor of the Senate, to \nbring the native Hawaiian issue to the floor of the Senate, and gun \nliability issues we talked about earlier this morning.\n  We are making progress. We did not quite finish foreign operations \ntoday but we will tomorrow. As we complete that bill and we finish with \nthe Dorr nomination, we will hopefully be able to accomplish all of \nthose bills.

Mr President, I have submitted this resolution with regard \nto Sudan, a country in Africa I have personally spent a lot of time in \nand participated with, both in the south and the north, in promoting \npeace there.\n  There have been 2 million people who have died in the Sudan as a \nproduct of a civil war that is now about 24 years old, and about 5 to 6 \nmillion people have been displaced.\n  The Sudan Peace Act looked predominantly at the north versus the \nsouth, although it is much more complicated than that oversimplified \ncomment. It is a separate issue than the Darfur crisis in western \nSudan, which this body has also paid a lot of attention to.\n  Real progress is being made in that part of the world, but continued \nfocus will be required to bring peace to that part of Africa.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed \nto, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 202) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 202\n\n       Whereas the people of Sudan have been devastated by war for \n     all but 10 years since Sudan gained its independence in 1956;\n       Whereas the second civil war in Sudan between the \n     Government of Sudan in the north and the Sudan People's \n     Liberation Army in the south began in 1983 and lasted for \n     more than 20 years;\n       Whereas more than 2,000,000 people died and more than \n     4,000,000 people were internationally displaced or became \n     refugees as a direct or indirect result of the civil war in \n     Sudan;\n       Whereas the Government of Sudan and the Sudan People's \n     Liberation Movement/Army failed on numerous occasions to \n     bring a peaceful and just end to the civil war in Sudan \n     throughout the 1990s;\n       Whereas in September 2001, President George W. Bush \n     appointed former Senator John Danforth as Special Envoy for \n     Peace in Sudan to explore the potential of the United States \n     to become involved in searching for a just resolution to the \n     civil war in Sudan, and appointed Andrew Natsios, the \n     Administrator of the United States Agency for International \n     Development, as the Special Humanitarian Coordinator for \n     Sudan to enhance the delivery of assistance that could help \n     reduce the suffering of the people of Sudan;\n       Whereas in July 2002, the Government of Sudan and the Sudan \n     People's Liberation Movement/Army reached the historic \n     Machakos Protocol, an agreement on the role of religion in \n     Sudan and the right to self-determination for the people of \n     southern Sudan;\n       Whereas in October 2002, the Government of Sudan and the \n     Sudan People's Liberation Movement/Army signed a memorandum \n     of understanding that called for a cessation of hostilities \n     and unimpeded humanitarian access to all areas of Sudan;\n       Whereas peace talks continued throughout 2003, with \n     discussions focusing on wealth sharing and the control of 3 \n     contested areas of Sudan;\n       Whereas on November 19, 2004, the Government of Sudan and \n     the Sudan People's Liberation Movement/Army signed a \n     declaration committing themselves to reach a final \n     comprehensive peace agreement by December 31, 2004, in the \n     context of a special session of the United Nations Security \n     Council;\n       Whereas on November 19, 2004, the United Nations Security \n     Council unanimously adopted Security Council Resolution 1574, \n     which welcomed the commitment of the Government of Sudan and \n     the Sudan People's Liberation Movement/Army to reach an \n     agreement by the end of 2004, and highlighted the intention \n     of the international community to assist the people of Sudan \n     and support the implementation of a comprehensive peace \n     agreement;\n       Whereas the Government of Sudan and the Sudan People's \n     Liberation Movement/Army initialed the final elements of a \n     comprehensive peace agreement on December 31, 2004;\n       Whereas on January 9, 2005, the Government of Sudan and the \n     Sudan People's Liberation Movement/Army formally signed the \n     Comprehensive Peace Agreement;\n       Whereas the Comprehensive Peace Agreement provides for a \n     new constitution, new arrangements for power sharing and \n     wealth sharing, and a 6-year interim period to be followed by \n     a referendum in southern Sudan so that the people of southern \n     Sudan can decide their political future;\n       Whereas the Comprehensive Peace Agreement provides for new \n     institutions to be created and a new Government of National\n\n[[Page S8500]]\n\n     Unity to be installed in Sudan once the constitution is \n     ratified;\n       Whereas despite progress on reaching a peace agreement on \n     the North-South conflict there has been little progress to \n     end the ongoing conflict in the region of Darfur;\n       Whereas after tens of thousands of civilians died due to a \n     targeted campaign of violence by the government of Khartoum, \n     Congress declared on July 22, 2004, that the atrocities in \n     Darfur were genocide, committed primarily by the Government \n     of Sudan and its allied Janjaweed militias;\n       Whereas on September 9, 2004, Secretary of State Colin \n     Powell testified that ``genocide has been committed in \n     Darfur'';\n       Whereas on June 30, 2005, President Bush confirmed that \n     ``the violence in Darfur region is clearly genocide [and] the \n     human cost is beyond calculation'';\n       Whereas the Comprehensive Peace Agreement provides a model \n     for the resolution of all conflicts in Sudan, including \n     Darfur, eastern Sudan, and elsewhere;\n       Whereas on July 9, 2005, the 6-year interim period under \n     the Comprehensive Peace Agreement began with the formation of \n     a new transitional government and the signing of an interim \n     constitution, and Dr. John Garang, the Chairman of the Sudan \n     People's Liberation Movement/Army, was sworn in by President \n     Omar Hassan al Bashir as First Vice President of Sudan;\n       Whereas millions of the people across Sudan continue to \n     suffer from the effects of war, including displacement and \n     war-related disease, hunger, and malnutrition;\n       Whereas the people of southern Sudan are in desperate need \n     of reconstruction assistance to build and improve vital \n     infrastructure components that are nearly nonexistent in \n     southern Sudan;\n       Whereas despite the historic signing of the Comprehensive \n     Peace Agreement in January 2005, the key to success will now \n     be the full and timely implementation of the agreement by all \n     sides, wholly consistent with the letter, spirit, and intent \n     of the agreement; and\n       Whereas the impact and efficacy of the Comprehensive Peace \n     Agreement will also be measured by the political resolution \n     of ongoing conflict in other parts of Sudan, including Darfur \n     and the east of Sudan: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commends the people of Sudan on the signing of the \n     historic Comprehensive Peace Agreement on January 9, 2005;\n       (2) urges the new Government of National Unity of Sudan, \n     consisting of elements of the National Congress Party and the \n     Sudan People's Liberation Movement/Army, to fully implement \n     the Comprehensive Peace Agreement in a timely manner \n     consistent with the letter, spirit, and intent of the \n     agreement;\n       (3) requests that the United States Government--\n       (A) commit to high-level, sustained engagement to closely \n     monitor the implementation of the Comprehensive Peace \n     Agreement and events on the ground in Sudan, including in \n     Darfur and elsewhere; and\n       (B) sustain pressure as appropriate to ensure the \n     Comprehensive Peace Agreement is implemented in a full, \n     timely, and thorough manner;\n       (4) urges the United States Government--\n       (A) to maintain sanctions on the Government of Sudan as \n     appropriate until the Comprehensive Peace Agreement has been \n     fully honored and implemented; and\n       (B) to renew efforts to implement additional sanctions \n     through the United Nations Security Council until peace in \n     Darfur is achieved and those responsible for genocide, war \n     crimes, crimes against humanity, and criminal acts are \n     brought to justice;\n       (5) strongly urges the Government of National Unity of \n     Sudan to use the Comprehensive Peace Agreement as the basis \n     for negotiation of a peaceful resolution of the conflicts in \n     Darfur and other areas of Sudan;\n       (6) strongly supports the expansion of the size and role of \n     the mission of the African Union in Darfur to protect \n     civilians in Darfur and encourages continued support for this \n     mission from the United States, the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization, and other countries and international \n     organizations;\n       (7) strongly supports the United Nations Mission in the \n     Sudan and the expansion of this mission to protect civilians \n     and aid workers throughout Sudan;\n       (8) supports the continued provision of humanitarian and \n     reconstruction assistance from the United States to the \n     people of southern Sudan, in addition to the assistance \n     allocated for the people of Darfur, so that the people of \n     Sudan may experience and appreciate the benefits of peace;\n       (9) supports international efforts to facilitate the safe \n     and voluntary return of refugees and internationally \n     displaced persons to their homes in Sudan; and\n       (10) calls upon the governments of all countries in the \n     Sudan region and around the world to actively support and \n     monitor the full implementation of the Comprehensive Peace \n     Agreement to help ensure that the people of Sudan pursue the \n     path to peace, prosperity, and security.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url":
