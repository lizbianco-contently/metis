Mr. President, this week, we are beginning with the House \nmessage on the Taxpayer Relief Act. This bill passed the Senate on \nFebruary 2 by a vote of 66 to 31. The House has appointed conferees, \nand we are now taking up that message to appoint Senate conferees. \nThere will be motions to instruct the conferees that will be offered by \nthe other side. They have provided us with a list, and we hope they \nwill not all be offered. We will be discussing that shortly after the \nopening this morning.\n  In any event, we will begin the process of appointing conferees with \nvotes on the motions to instruct. As I announced on Friday, we will \ndebate the motions today and stack the votes to begin around 8 o'clock \nthis evening. Therefore, we do expect votes to begin at that time. We \nmay decide to have some of the votes on Tuesday morning, depending on \nhow many of these motions to instruct the other side offers, but we \nwill make that determination after we discuss what will be offered, and \nhopefully, during the course of the afternoon, I am sure that will \nsettle out. I will reiterate that we will be in session into the \nevening with those votes.\n  This is the last week of legislative business before the Presidents' \nDay recess. We will first appoint conferees on the tax bill, and we \nwill return to the asbestos bill after we address the tax bill over the \ncourse of today and likely into the early morning tomorrow.\n  We have a point of order pending to the asbestos bill, and Senators \nwill desire some further debate before we vote on that waiver motion. \nWe will be conferring with Senators on both sides to determine the best \ntime for that vote.\n  Finally, I also mention that we need to address the PATRIOT Act \nbefore we leave. We will complete the PATRIOT Act before we leave. It \nis a bill that addresses concerns on both sides of the aisle, and we \nwill proceed to that bill before finishing the week. Senators should \nnot plan to depart early this week. As my colleagues can tell, we\n\n[[Page S1078]]\n\nhave a very busy week planned with the three matters I have mentioned.\n  In addition, I hope we will be able to proceed with appointing \nconferees to the pensions bill as well. It will be a full week, and I \nwill be updating Members as the week progresses, but it will be a week \nthat will require votes today, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday \nto complete our business.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, through the Chair to the distinguished \nmajority leader, how many votes does the majority leader intend to have \ntonight?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, through the Chair in response, it really \ndepends on how many of these motions we have. They are coming from the \nDemocratic side of the aisle, and although a list has been provided, \nhow many actually will require a vote--I would think we would have at \nleast two tonight, and then if there are a lot of motions, we would \nhave to have more tonight because we do need to complete whatever votes \nthere are tomorrow and then get back to the asbestos bill in the \nmorning to continue to address the waiver of the point of order.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the distinguished majority leader mentioned \nthe PATRIOT Act. While the Presiding Officer is in the chair, I express \nmy personal appreciation for the many hours of work he put forth in \nresolving the PATRIOT Act dispute. It was a bipartisan problem. The \ndistinguished junior Senator from New Hampshire worked long and hard to \ncome up with a conclusion. I appreciate being advised during the \nprocess as he was visiting with the White House. Of course, as has been \nsaid, the Presiding Officer didn't get everything he wanted, certainly \nI didn't, but it is a much better piece of legislation than when it \ncame back from the House. So I compliment and applaud the Senator from \nNew Hampshire for his hard work.\n\n  I say through the Chair to the distinguished majority leader, we are \nready to move forward on this legislation. As has been explained by the \nSenator from Tennessee, we have at least one Senator who is going to \nmake us go through all the procedural hoops, so that will take some \ntime. But the vast majority of the Senators over here want this matter \nto move forward, and we will offer help in any way we can to move this \nalong, with the understanding that there are some who want to make sure \nthat all of the procedural hoops are jumped.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in brief response, as I outlined, we are \nready pretty soon to go to the PATRIOT Act. I agree, the negotiations \nwhich have taken place under the leadership of the Presiding Officer \nhave gone smoothly, and I think we are going to have an overwhelming \nvote in the Senate. The House, through their leadership, has expressed \nsupport, as I believe the administration has. So I do wish to make a \nrequest of our colleagues that although there are procedural hoops \nwhich we can be made to jump through, I don't think it is in the best \ninterests of the American people to unduly delay this important bill \nthat essentially, at least by statements today, is going to have \noverwhelmingly, strong support.\n  We do have a lot to do this week, and we will use the time as \neffectively and efficiently as possible. But if we keep having delays \nsuch as people coming back tonight to vote on motions to instruct, on \nwhich we could argue as to how useful that actually is, or we have too \nmany procedural roadblocks based on this bill, it is going to be \nimpossible for us to move ahead and move the country forward when we \nhave so much important legislation. So I think we can complete all of \nour business this week, but it is going to take a lot of cooperation on \nboth sides of the aisle not to throw too many procedural roadblocks in \nfront of us.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/13/senate-section/article/S1078-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1078]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, we do have eight motions to instruct. I \ndoubt very seriously there will be any others. I will say this: This is \nthe procedure, and if the minority wanted to stall this budget \nreconciliation conference, we could do that. Under the rules of the \nSenate, we could have, instead of the 8 motions to instruct, 80 or 800. \nWe are not in any way trying to prevent this legislation from going \nthrough. As bad as it is, we recognize that we have had a fair shot at \nit on the floor on a number of occasions. But the eight instructions \nare instructions that are well taken, and we hope the conferees will \nfollow these instructions. We don't know if any of them will be agreed \nto. We certainly hope so, but it is certainly something that is worth \ndebating.\n  I was surprised to hear that the distinguished majority leader, when \nhe announced we were going to this piece of legislation, this budget \nmatter, did not call it what it has been called for more than a year; \nthat is, the Budget Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. I guess everyone has \ncome to the realization that the Budget Deficit Reduction Act does not \nreduce the deficit; it increases it by $50 billion. And I guess there \nhas been a change of name, calling it the Taxpayer Relief Act. I guess \nif you are rich, it is a Taxpayer Relief Act, but for the poor and \nmiddle class, it increases the deficit and it is not a fair piece of \nlegislation.\n  On asbestos, I believe there are two groups of people who really need \nto make sure Congress takes care of them: those people who, through no \nfault of their own, get the dreaded mesothelioma and they die, and \nasbestosis, which is aggravating and serious, and they die; one just \ntakes longer than the other. The goal of the Senate should be to make \nsure these two groups of victims are compensated for their pain and \nsuffering, which came about through no fault of their own. What we want \nto try to avoid are the bad cases, the ones that are taking too much of \nthe court's time and taking valuable resources from these people who \nare really sick.\n  I made a commitment to the junior Senator from Texas, Mr. Cornyn, \nthat I believe we need asbestos legislation. I really do believe that. \nI have told him I would be happy to work with him and Senator Durbin, \nas my designee, to try to come up with legislation that is patterned \nafter successful programs in Illinois and Texas, where there is medical \ncriteria set up.\n  For example, in Illinois, they have a pleural registry where people \nare able to list their names if they work around asbestos, the statute \nof limitations is tolled, and then if something happens to them down \nthe road, they are not prevented from going to court as a result of the \nstatute of limitations. It would do away with the bad cases.\n  As I said, we are committed to coming up with legislation such as \nthat. Senator Cornyn offered some, but there wasn't an ample amount of \ntime to debate his suggestion, and that is too bad. But we are willing \nto work with him on something similar to what he came up with. I \nbelieve it is important that we do that, and I am certainly making a \ncommitment that we will work to see what we can come up with on medical \ncriteria legislation to, in effect, get rid of the bad cases and allow \nthese two sets of victims to move forward.\n  This FAIR Act we have before the Senate is anything but fair. I have \nexplained how this bill will harm victims by trapping them in \nadministrative claims systems which are irreparably defective and \ndoomed to failure.\n  One of the primary reasons the trust fund is doomed to fail is \nbecause of unrealistic and sloppy calculations that led to the $140 \nbillion trust fund in the first place. In designing this bill, the bill \nsponsors have not adequately assessed the number of future claims by \nasbestos victims, the borrowing costs necessary for the trust fund to \nfunction, and the administrative costs associated with operating the \ntrust fund and claims system.\n  Last August, the Congressional Budget Office estimated the program \ncould generate as much as $150 billion in claims, leaving the trust \nfund way short, billions of dollars short. As I have explained, even \nthat figure understates the problem because the bill does not \nadequately take into account the trust fund's borrowing costs, further \ndepleting the compensation available to victims. The CBO estimates \napproximately $8 billion will be borrowed before the first decade, an \namount that will saddle the fund with huge debt-\n\n[[Page S1079]]\n\nservice costs over the life of the program. The Senate Budget \nCommittee, through its own analysis, also concludes that taxpayers will \nhave to finance a significant amount of the fund's debt service. \nContributions to the fund will occur over a 30-year period, but most of \nthe claims are expected in the early years of the program. That is what \nthe borrowing is all about.\n  I have spoken to Karl Rove, one of the President's top men. He is \ntalking about setting up some kind of a task force made up of Members \nof Congress and others to look at the huge costs that are out there. \nThey are getting higher every day.\n  We will have a vote in the next few weeks on increasing the debt \nceiling from $8.2 trillion to--I don't know how high the administration \nwants it raised. If people are concerned about the deficit, they have \nto look at this bill before the Senate, this asbestos bill. Other \nexperts believe it is on even less solid fiscal footing than CBO. For \ninstance, the Bates White economic consulting firm has concluded the \nprogram will cost as much as $600 billion or more. This is not some \nfront by the asbestos lawyers. It amended its analysis and found \nanother $90 billion error in CBO's analysis because the CBO \nunderestimated the number of cancer victims who will likely file \nclaims.\n  The pending question on this bill is a long-term spending budget \npoint of order by Senator Ensign, my colleague from Nevada. The 2006 \nbudget resolution prohibits any net increase in direct spending in \nexcess of $5 billion in any of the four 10-year periods from 2016 \nthrough 2055. Based on its own estimates, which are inadequate, the CBO \nconcluded that enacting the asbestos bill would violate that spending \nprohibition.\n  In the substitute bill, the bill's sponsors attempted to cure these \nbudgetary concerns and assured this body that there will be no Federal \nborrowing. Their efforts failed. First, the substitute contained new \nlanguage that the bill: is not intended to increase the deficit or \nimpose any burden on the taxpayer.\n  Stating the intention, however, cannot erase the effects of this \nbill. The bill will increase an entitlement for asbestos victims and \nhas obligated the Federal Government to provide compensation to those \nvictims. Throughout the fund's existence, the Federal Government is \nobligated to pay regardless of the actual amounts raised for the fund \nthrough company contributions, and this contributions remains so long \nas the fund is operational.\n  Last week I gave the example of 4 companies, each an American company \nover 100 years old. They will all go bankrupt if this bill passes. One \nis an engineering/consulting firm. One makes wire. They will go out of \nbusiness. Right now, they have taken care of their asbestos claims. \nThey, like a lot of businesses, purchased insurance. One of the \ncompanies pays nothing, zero, for asbestos claims. If this bill passes, \nthey will pay $19.5 million a year. They cannot do it. They will go \nbroke. It is unfair. Based on the timing issues and expected shortfalls \ndiscussed above, taxpayers most certainly will shoulder some of the \ncosts related to this fund.\n  The managers' substitute bill provides that in assessing whether \nthere are sufficient moneys in the trust fund to continue paying out \nthe claims, the administrator of the fund can only consider nontaxpayer \nresources, but these funds include funds borrowed from the taxpayer. If \nanything, this language increases the likelihood that the trust fund \nadministrator will be forced to use taxpayer dollars to finance the \nfund.\n  Let's be realistic about this. Black lung was supposed to cost $3 \nbillion; it is now up to $41 billion. Once these programs start, these \nentitlement programs, Congress does not cut them off. Despite the \nbill's sponsors' best efforts, the bill continues to have enormous \nfinancial implications for the Federal Government and the American \ntaxpayers. Federal spending on asbestos claims facilitated by this bill \nwill violate the 2006 budget resolution and require borrowing of \ntaxpayer dollars in order to function.\n  Again, the budget point of order is valid and should be sustained. \nBut if the point of order is sustained, that will not be the end of the \nasbestos debate. We need to do something. I have stated now, today, for \nthe third time, I am committed to work with Senator Cornyn, and Senator \nDurbin is my designee to work with him to come up with an approach that \nwill allow these asbestos cases that are bad to get out of the system. \nWe can move forward on this issue. But the pending bill is not the way \nto do it. It is a bad bill, and in light of the serious budget problems \nwe are having in the country, with an $8.2 trillion debt ceiling about \nto be violated, it is important that we get this bill off the floor and \ndo other things. One of the things we will continue to do is, this \nyear, work on the asbestos litigation problem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/13/senate-section/article/S1079-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1079]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the Chair \nlays before the Senate the House message to accompany H.R. 4297.\n  The Acting President pro tempore laid before the Senate a message \nfrom the House of Representatives disagreeing to the amendment of the \nSenate to the bill (H.R. 4297) entitled ``An Act to provide for \nreconciliation pursuant to section 201(b) of the concurrent resolution \non the budget for fiscal year 2006,'' and asks a conference with the \nSenate on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses thereon.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenate insists on its amendment and agrees to the request of the House \nfor a conference.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume \noff of the time that has been designated on the pending issue.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, it is Monday at noon and I think the \npeople's business needs to be attended to sooner rather than later, in \nthe daylight rather than at night, so I rise to point out my concern \nthat the Senate continues to fiddle while Rome burns. I have no idea \nwhy there is a justification for up to 10 hours of debate and multiple \nmotions to instruct on this tax reconciliation. We have been through \nthis already multiple times. This convoluted procedure is, in my \nopinion, very unhelpful for the legislative process and for the \nrelationship between the two sides of the aisle. There is no need for \nthis. The Senate has voted twice already on this and 66 Senators are \nfor this bill--or 68, 66 and 68. Go back and look at the Record. So we \nare going to go to conference.\n  We can't let these motions to instruct prevail. By the way, they are \noutrageously ridiculous, anyway. Nobody pays any attention to that. I \nhope to be a conferee. Do you think I am going to pay any attention to \nany motions to instruct me? Baloney.\n  The Senate leadership that is responsible for the way we do our \nbusiness and the way we appear to the American people needs to get a \ngrip on this situation. The very idea that there would be even 3 \nmotions to instruct, let alone 8, 9, 10--we have to stop this. We have \nhad our chance to make our speeches. We don't need to eat up 3, 5, 10 \nhours of debate on this bill. What in the heck are we going to say? Are \nwe going to talk about the snow event this weekend? Nobody is going to \nbe snowed by what is going on here. This is delay and obstruction. We \nneed to find a way to get over this. I realize Senators have their \nrights to have motions to instruct. But how can we move this process \nforward?\n  That leads me to my next point, in terms of fiddling while there is a \nproblem that is getting worse. If you talk to the American people, an \nawful lot of\n\n[[Page S1080]]\n\npeople are concerned about the future and their retirements. Will the \nretirement benefits be available to them and to their children? Will \nthey be there when they need them? Will they be portable? We need \npension reform. We need certainty in pensions. People need to know what \nthe law is going to be. We need to know it is going to be actuarially \nsound. How are we going to pay for all these benefits people are \nexpecting in their pensions when they retire?\n  Of course, an important part of this pension bill is what are we \ngoing to do about aviation pensions? Airlines are having a difficult \ntime. They are teetering in the balance. At least a couple of them are \nprepared, if they have to, to enter into bankruptcy and walk away from \ntheir pensions. But they don't want to. They want to do the right \nthing. They don't want the taxpayers to be saddled with these pensions \nthat airlines unfortunately quite often agreed to in the past. They \nwant some way to make sure those pensions are protected.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, and the leadership, \nto find a way to move forward, to appoint conferees on the pension \nbill, so we can step up to this issue that worries people. Why should \nit take days or weeks to appoint conferees on a bill that is broadly \nsupported, is going to be bipartisan, and is important to the working \nmen and women of America?\n  I know there is a lot that goes on in making these appointments. You \nhave to decide on the numbers and you have a lot of Senators who would \nlike to be conferees. But I plead with our leadership to find a way to \nget the conferees appointed--not tomorrow, not Wednesday--today, \nbecause we are fiddling while people's pensions are burning. It \nconcerns me.\n  I am glad to be here. I am here. I am perfectly willing to be a pain \nin everybody's neck as the day and the week progresses so we can find a \nway to get to a conclusion on two conference issues. These are issues \nwe can get into in conference. These are issues on which we can get a \nresult.\n  I urge our leadership to find a way to appoint these conferees as \nsoon as possible on the pension bill and to get into conference on the \ntax bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, first, I agree we should be moving forward \non the pension conference. It is very important. We are ready to do \nthat.\n  I would also suggest that this budget reconciliation could already \nhave been finished. We over here didn't choose what the majority leader \nbrought to the floor. Instead of bringing to the floor the conference \nreport dealing with taxes, he decided to bring asbestos, a bill that \nwasn't ready to come to the floor. We were ready to move on this any \ntime last week.\n  I say to my friend, the distinguished Senator from Mississippi, whom \nI have so enjoyed working with over the years, if we were truly trying \nto delay this legislation, we could do that. Under the rules, which I \nthink should be changed, instead of having the 8 motions to instruct \nwhich we have, we could have 80 or 800. The rule is not good. We need \nto change this whole budget setup.\n  Again, if this legislation had been brought to the floor last week \nrather than the asbestos legislation, we could have finished it.\n  Also, I think we have been fairly direct in our amendments which we \nhave on the conference report. They are not on subjects that are \noutside of the scope of this bill. We have one, which will be a motion \nto instruct, to not raise the debt ceiling. There will be another one \nregarding the need to replenish the military--which all experts say is \n$50 billion--and replace vehicles and other such things because of the \nwar in Iraq; both Guard and Reserve, $50 billion; to take some of the \ntax cuts and give it to our military; and the same with veterans health \nbenefits. There is a very important amendment dealing with energy to \nhelp make us a little more energy independent.\n  I am not going to go through all of the motions to instruct other \nthan to say they are important, and also, frankly, we haven't been much \nof a participant in the conference, anyway. We might as well give the \nconferees some idea of what we are thinking since they do not invite us \nto the meetings.\n  I agree with the Senator from Mississippi; it is important that the \nbudget process be changed. I think it is right--if we had wanted to, we \ncould stop this thing from ever moving forward. Rather than spending a \nfew hours on it, we could spend weeks on it. That would be wrong.\n  I hope we can have a bipartisan group of Senators take a look at how \nwe can change this whole budget process in the Senate. It is subject to \na lot of abuse, no matter who is in power.\n  I suggest that on our motions to instruct we are willing to move \nforward on those quickly. We complained about the 8 o'clock votes. We \nare willing to finish the votes tomorrow, but it will take a little bit \nof time.\n  Further, it is my understanding that maybe the Republicans have some \namendments they want to offer. We have eight. I don't see our side \nhaving more. Under the rule we could have more, but I think that would \nbe all.\n  I look forward to working with my friend from Mississippi to make \nsure we can move forward on this legislation, particularly the pension \nreform, which is so important to the country.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all quorum \ncalls which we might have on the pending issue be equally charged to \nboth sides.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, earlier this month we began and finished \nthe second floor debate on the tax relief reconciliation bill. At that \ntime, I spoke in recognition of Groundhog Day because it was just \naround the corner. I have next to me that portrait of Punxsutawney \nPhil. Phil is the groundhog.\n  In thinking of Phil and his unique form of weather reporting, I \nthought about that popular film entitled ``Groundhog Day'' starring \nBill Murray in which a man relives the same day, Groundhog Day, over \nand over again. This film has taken on even greater significance for me \nas I seem to be in a similar situation for the third time. More than \njust the sense of deja vu, I feel as though I am reliving a couple of \npast experiences, and before these several votes tonight or tomorrow, I \nthink everybody will agree with me.\n  I have before you another chart. The chart shows a scene from the \nBill Murray movie ``Groundhog Day.'' From this movie is a picture of \nPhil, the groundhog, driving the car and Bill Murray is there with him. \nBill Murray is in this case the copilot. Phil is driving the car. You \nsee Phil with his paws on the steering wheel, and you see the copilot \nseated behind him.\n  As I said just now, I feel like the Bill Murray character in the \nmovie. It seems we are reliving the same events over and over again. We \nare going through the same debates over and over again.\n  For those who watch C-SPAN regularly--probably not too many \nAmericans--they know what I am talking about because it was 2 weeks ago \nwe were debating the tax reconciliation bill, the same tax \nreconciliation bill we were debating back in November, and the same \ndebate we had a couple of weeks ago.\n\n  I will summarize the floor process we have been going through on this \nbill.\n  At 11:08 a.m. on Wednesday, February 1, 2006, I opened the second \nSenate floor debate on this bill. The rollcall vote on final passage \noccurred at 9:42 p.m. on Thursday, Groundhog Day, 2006. All the time \npermitted for debate under reconciliation--20 hours--was used in the \nsecond floor debate--again, Groundhog Day.\n  Three Senators were not here for the final vote. There was a total of \neight rollcall votes that day, including the vote on final passage.\n  You will recall that, as I said, this was the second time. I hope you \nwill recall I said then that we actually had debate earlier in November \non the very same bill. The very same bill is this bill right here, S. \n2020, the Tax Reconciliation Act.\n  We started that debate at 3:35 p.m. on Wednesday, November 16, 2005. \nFor 20 hours on Wednesday, Thursday, and into Friday we debated this \nbill, S. 2020. A total of 80 amendments was filed, and 7 of those \namendments were agreed to. The liveliness of the legislation culminated \nin 18 rollcall votes.\n\n[[Page S1081]]\n\nThe final vote on passage came at 12:05 in the morning of Friday, the \n18th of November, 2005. According to the Secretary of the Senate, 97 of \nus were there for that vote. I must not be the only one who is reliving \nthis experience of Groundhog Day over and over again.\n  There is one Senator whom I can't speak for, so I have to clarify \nthat the new Senator, Senator Menendez, was not a Senator during the \nfirst debate back in November. He has been appointed to the Senate \nsince then. He was here for the second debate because he joined the \nSenate after the first bill passed. Maybe the second debate would not \nbe old hat to him, but for the other 99 Senators it would be more or \nless old hat.\n  Here are the two bills. Technically, right now we are on the House \nbill, H.R. 4297, but between these two publications, I guess it would \nbe fair to say they are 95 percent the same.\n  This bill, S. 2020, was first debated in November last year and \npassed then as the Tax Relief Act of 2005. The Senate passed the second \nbill, after we amended the provisions of this to it, as H.R. 4297. The \nfirst bill, S. 2020, is 417 pages long, and the second bill, H.R. 4297, \nas amended, is 363 pages long. The bills are very close to the same \nlength. What happened in between was between November and February, the \nSenate removed the Hurricane Katrina provisions and interest suspension \nprovision because those proposals became law in a separate piece of \nlegislation in November 2005. Removing the Katrina provisions and the \ninterest suspension provision accounted for a reduction of 63 pages \nfrom this bill. The five amendments agreed to during the second floor \ndebate added 14 pages to H.R 4297.\n  Again, except for those five amendments that were put in, plus the \nKatrina provisions taken out, most all of this bill is pretty much the \nsame.\n  So why are we debating this for a third time, November of last year, \n3 days, 2 days this year, on February 1 and February 2, and now back \nhere again this very day, February 13?\n  My point is these two bills are virtually the same. The Senate \nbasically debated the same popular, bipartisan bill twice, and we are \ngoing through another one of these purposeless delays at the insistence \nof the Democratic leadership again today, and it may take much more \nthan 1 day.\n  As we consider what they are going to offer--we refer to them as \nmotions to instruct the conferees--to the bill, we are going to go to \nconference on H.R. 4297 to work out the differences between the House \nand Senate. I have to ask my colleagues: Why are we still doing this? \nDidn't we already go through this exercise? Shouldn't we be finished \nwith the Senate debate? For me, the answer to those questions is there \nis no reason to be here. All you have to do is in 5 seconds appoint \nconferees and get to work ironing out the differences between the House \nand the Senate.\n  Without a doubt, we have gone through this exercise twice. When is \ndebate on the same subject enough for the Senate? In the face of the \nmultitude of other important issues this body needs to deal with, does \nthe Democratic leadership want to reenact recent debates and \nresuscitate old talking points? The tax reconciliation bill already \npassed with the support of 64 of us the first time. The second time we \npassed this bill, the bill garnered the support of 68 Members. Included \nin the first count were 15 Democrats. I am pleased we picked up two \nmore Democrats the second time we debated the bill. Maybe if we keep up \nthis exercise enough times, we will have a bill that will get 100 \nSenators for it.\n\n  What is the purpose of that? If we do that, we will not be passing \nthis bill in the year 2006; we will be passing this bill in the year \n2007. Do not think that the millions of taxpayers expecting us to act \nwould be very happy about running the Senate through that many \nGroundhog Days. Even Phil, the groundhog, might even be a bit \nirritated. Phil, wouldn't you be irritated if you had to go through all \nof this?\n  This legislation is extremely important. We will debate it as long as \nnecessary. I question the necessity of going through a process that \nresulted in bipartisan passage of the same bill almost 3 months ago. We \noften think bipartisanship is when we get to 60. You are lucky to get \nto 60. That is what you have to do in the Senate to get anything done. \nTo get to 64 or 68 is almost a landslide in the Senate. Why the \ncontinued debate? I doubt if the people who are stalling this want to \ncontinue the debate long enough to convince even more Democrats to vote \nfor this bill. I don't think that is their motive.\n  That is my first point. This is a very curious exercise. It is an \nexercise with no apparent purpose other than delay. Is the delay on the \npart of the Democratic leadership important? The answer is, yes. Ask \nAmerican tax-paying families and you will get an answer, but you get a \ndifferent answer. The answer is, yes, if you are 1 of 20 million \nfamilies waiting for certainty that you are not caught in the clutches \nof the alternative minimum tax with which this bill deals.\n  We hear a lot of talk about the alternative minimum tax. We will hear \nabout it in the debate over the next few hours. This bill does \nsomething about the AMT. It holds harmless 20 million Americans so they \nwill not be hit by a tax that they were never supposed to pay in the \nfirst place.\n  I will use some charts that describe different provisions of this \nlegislation and how it affects the constituents of each of the \nSenators, on a State-by-State basis. The data is from the Internal \nRevenue Service. It is the latest available in terms of State-by-State \nimpact. The data comes from the year 2003, so it understates the tax \nproblems of citizens in the various States for taxes in the year 2006. \nI apologize for not having more up-to-date information. I suggest to \npeople who are considering the figures on the charts to more than \ndouble the figures; that will be a rough State-by-State idea.\n  We will look at a chart dealing with the alternative minimum tax. \nThis tax will hit 20 million Americans if we do not pass this \nlegislation. It is not on the taxes they will file for 2005 because we \nare talking about income earned during the year 2006. They will be hit \nby the alternative minimum tax 12 months from now, when people file \ntheir taxes, if we do not pass this legislation.\n  When you start a tax year, you ought to have some idea what the tax \nlaws are going to be for the next 12 months and into the future. That \nis why this legislation should have been passed in conference last fall \nto get a permanent law so people earning money on January 2, 2006, \nwould know they would not be hit by the alternative minimum tax.\n  The basis of the bill the Senate passed and the bill that is once \nagain before the Senate is an extension of the AMT hold harmless, so \nthat no additional number of people will be hit by the alternative \nminimum tax. Every Member who is participating in this deliberate \nstrategy of delaying our entry to conference to work out the difference \nbetween the House and the Senate is delaying the certainty these \nmillions of American families deserve. Again, it affected 8 million in \n2003. That figure now is 20 million in 2006. For my State of Iowa, it \nis 65,000 taxpayers. It is probably tens of thousands more now. In \nNevada, there are 68,000, with a lot more than 68,000 being hit in \n2006.\n  Those are the facts on the alternative minimum tax. Look it up in the \nInternal Revenue Code. The AMT relief provisions expired December 31, \n2005. I ask my friends and the Democratic leadership to look at the \ncalendar: 1\\1/2\\ months have passed, and the alternative minimum tax \nhold harmless has not been extended to prevent 20 million Americans \nfrom being hit by a tax on income earned in 2006; earning the same \nincome in 2005, they would not have had to pay that tax. The AMT hold-\nharmless provisions are the cornerstone of this legislation. It is the \ncornerstone of a bill that the Democratic leadership is delaying. I \ndon't want to hear people talk about the alternative minimum tax \nproblem and at the same time delay real action to help those millions \nof tax-paying families. I suggest we may hear that.\n  This bill also includes another provision, broadly popular and \nbroadly applicable in its tax benefits. I will talk about them beyond \nthe alternative minimum tax.\n  This chart shows deductibility of college tuition, first inaugurated \nin the tax bill of 2001. This is a benefit for families who send their \nkids to college. By definition, this benefit goes to middle-income \nfamilies. A lot of these families are not low income so their kids\n\n[[Page S1082]]\n\npossibly do not qualify for Pell grants. They are not high income \neither. All they have to do is have mom and dad write out a check, and \nthey go to college. These are families that get the full benefit of the \ndeduction if they make up to $65,000 as a single person or up to \n$130,000 as a couple.\n  The reason I say it is conservated on the middle income is because \nabove those figures the benefit phases out. A lot of these families are \npaying significant Federal, State, and local taxes, and they get no \nhelp in defraying the high costs of their kids' college tuition. This \ntax deduction provides help for these hard-pressed, middle-income \nfamilies with a benefit and furthers a very important national goal \nthat we try to give attention to, the support for higher education. \nThis deduction runs out at the end of this year, 2006. These families \nnext year will face tax increases if we do not act on this bill. We \nought to act on it now, although it does not phase out until the end of \nthis year. During the spring, people anticipate their capability of \nsending their kids to college. If they cannot count on this, they have \nto dig up money someplace else for their kids to start college in \nSeptember, which carries over into 2007.\n  The chart before the Senate shows the number of families, on a State-\nby-State basis, that benefit from this deduction. I emphasize that \nthese are 2003 figures. I don't know exactly how much more we increase \nthem because we are now in 2006, but it would be significant. In Iowa, \nmore than 37,000 families are affected by this legislation, 37,000 in \nIowa who do not know for sure if the tax deduction will be available \nwhen their kids go to college next year.\n  Now I will pick out another State. Nevada has 25,000 families. If we \ndo not pass this legislation, 25,000 families will not know whether \ntheir kids are going to get the advantage of this tax for the next \nschool year.\n  It seems to me the perpetuation of support for higher education, \nparticularly for middle-income families, that their families cannot \nqualify for Pell grants, we ought to be reenacting this legislation now \nso these families can plan on sending their kids to college next \nSeptember.\n  Another benefit addressed in this bill is the small savers credit. \nThis gets back to the problem we are always talking about, that \nAmericans are not saving enough. Lower income people, spending most of \ntheir disposable income on the necessities of life, do not have money \nleft over to save. They may not have an ethic to save. Through the Tax \nCode, we try to give incentive to save and some help to save. This \nhappens to be the tax credit for low-income people to save through an \nindividual retirement account or a pension plan. Saving money is \nimportant. We all want all Americans to be part of the effort to save \nfor the future.\n  This chart shows the number of low-income savers who benefit from \nthis bill, on a State-by-State basis, from the small savers tax credit. \nAgain, more than 5.5 million people take advantage of this. How many \nmore for the 2006 figures, I don't know, but in Iowa 95,000 people take \nadvantage of saving money through the small savers tax credit. And I \nwill also take Nevada: 36,000, almost 37,000 people 3 years ago were \nsaving through this program. That needs to be reenacted or there will \nnot be incentive to save.\n  The bill before the Senate also extends another needed tax deduction. \nThis is for teachers who buy their own supplies for their students. \nThis provision was developed by Senators Warner and Collins. It makes \nwhole teachers who go that extra mile to pay out of their own pocket \nclassroom expenses. Who is going to argue with a devoted teacher whose \nschool district does not provide enough supply if she wants to spend \nout of her own salary, his or her own salary, to buy supplies? That \nproves the dedication of our teachers.\n  I will point to the number of teachers included on the chart, on a \nState-by-State basis, who take advantage of this deduction. This \ndeduction needs to be reenacted for these teachers to have the \ncertainty that money they will spend today will be deductible from the \ntaxes they file 12 months from now. Again, in my State of Iowa, almost \n34,000 Iowa teachers benefit from this. Another State we could look at \nwould be Nevada, where 22,000 families benefit.\n\n  Is there any reason this help to teachers--who are good teachers but \nwant to make better use of their talent, to make sure their students \nhave adequate supplies--why that should not be reenacted, and why, this \nvery day, in classrooms across America, teachers have to be worrying \nabout whether they are going to have this benefit to reimburse them for \ngoing that extra mile?\n  Now, there is another item in this bill which is very popular which I \ndo not have shown on a chart. But this bill extends what we call small \nbusiness expensing, so that anything which is depreciable, on an \nincreased amount of money of up to $100,000, can be expensed in 1 year \nrather than spreading it out over a period of 5 to 10 years. Many small \nbusinesses use this benefit to buy equipment on an efficient, after-tax \nbasis.\n  This is very good for small business. Small business creates 70 to 80 \npercent of the new jobs in America. So it is a job-creation tax \nincentive. It is good, then, for workers in these small businesses. \nObviously, if you employ more people, you end up with greater economic \ngrowth for our entire country.\n  The final chart I have deals with the tax deductibility of the State \nand local sales tax deduction. This applies to the States of Alaska, \nFlorida, Nevada, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, and \nWyoming.\n  This bill helps 12.3 million taxpayers in your States. Tennessee is \none of these States. It is the home State of our majority leader. He \nhas worked hard to get this bill to the floor. For the third time now, \nour majority leader, Senator Bill Frist, has worked hard to move this \nbill into conference. I want the good people of Tennessee to know that.\n  Now, another State that could benefit when we get this passed is \nNevada, the home State of our Democratic leader. Unfortunately, this \nbill is going through another process of holding it up for another day \nof debate, meaning the people in these States who have deductibility of \ntheir State taxes do not know whether, come 12 months from now when \nthey are filing their income tax on income earned in 2006, it will be \ndeductible.\n  So I would ask them to focus on the taxpayers of these respective \nStates. I still hold out hope that the Democrat leadership will see the \nlight. I hope they will work with me to guarantee that the folks in \ntheir States will be able to deduct their sales taxes this year. This \nis the third time, then, this bill has been delayed.\n  This is a bipartisan bill with a bipartisan consensus. This needs to \npass. Maybe the third time will be a charm. Maybe we will finally get \nthis bipartisan bill to conference because you do not get bills to \nconference around here that are not bipartisan because when you only \nhave 55 Republicans in the Senate, there is no way, even when all of us \nvote alike--and we do not vote alike--we can move a bill to conference. \nSo it has to be bipartisan. You have to have Democratic support. So in \nthis particular instance, we have 15, 16, 17, roughly, of the Democrats \nvoting for it.\n  Every Senator ought to help us pass this bill because of the \nprovisions I just went through on these charts which are included in \nthe bill. But there are also other reasons for supporting this bill.\n  Our bill addresses expiring business and individual provisions that \nare known as extenders. These provisions include items such as the \nresearch and development tax credit and the work opportunity tax \ncredit. This bill also includes many of the charitable incentives \nintroduced in what we call by the acronym the CARE Act and which \nprovisions have previously passed the Finance Committee and passed the \nentire Senate.\n  In this regard, in regard to the CARE Act, in regard to the R \ncredit, I have to give particular applause to Senators Santorum and \nBaucus in working with me to balance these incentives with several of \nthe much-needed reforms that are supported by the charitable sector, \nthe Treasury Department, the IRS, and donors and taxpayers to make sure \ncharitable giving is not abused.\n  Last, but not least, this bill contains loophole closers and tax \nshelter-fighting provisions that raise revenue.\n  This bill is bipartisan.\n\n[[Page S1083]]\n\n  I thank my friend and working partner and ranking member, Senator \nBaucus, for his cooperation. He and I were not always partners on this \nbill, at least in the beginning, but we teamed up in the Finance \nCommittee. We teamed up in the first Groundhog Day floor debate. We \nteamed up in the second Groundhog Day debate. I look forward to working \nwith him today and hope we can team up in the conference working out \nthe differences between the House and the Senate. As always, his \ncooperation and, in tense times, his good humor make a big difference \nin this body.\n  Let me also thank those Democratic Senators who joined us in this \nbipartisan effort on our first floor journey. Most of them repeated \nthrough the second time on February 1 and 2 of this year. I ask them to \nhelp me persuade their leaders to let this bill proceed. I ask them to \nask their leaders to focus on taking care of tax legislative business, \nbringing certainty to the tax policy of this country for the benefit of \nour taxpayers and the benefit of investment because investment creates \njobs. I ask that the political games be cut out. I ask that we roll up \nour sleeves and get down to the people's business.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                      Motion To Instruct Conferees\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I send to the desk a motion to instruct \nconferees and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       Mr. Kennedy moves that the managers on the part of the \n     Senate at the conference on the disagreeing votes of the 2 \n     Houses on the Senate amendments to the bill H.R. 4297 (to \n     provide for reconciliation pursuant to the concurrent \n     resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2006 (H. Con. Res. \n     95)) be instructed to reject the extension of the capital \n     gains and dividends rate reduction contained in section 203 \n     of the bill as passed by the House of Representatives.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, Americans are wondering what has happened \nto their Government. They are working hard to raise strong families and \nto live the American dream. But with each passing day, they find the \nAmerican dream farther and farther out of reach as they juggle just to \nmake ends meet. Over the past 5 years, the cost of health insurance has \njumped 73 percent. Gasoline is up 74 percent; college tuition, 45 \npercent; housing, 44 percent. The list goes on and on and up and up.\n  Working families do not ask for much. Low- and middle-income families \nare doing their part. But they could use a little fair play from their \nGovernment as they are facing such hard times.\n  But that is not what is going on in Washington today. Again and again \nand again, under this Republican President and this Republican \nCongress, they have seen trillions of their tax dollars given away in \ntax breaks to the wealthy and to corporations while the rest of America \nis asked to sacrifice. And this bill and the budget President Bush sent \nto Congress last week are yet another example.\n  The House version of the bill before us provides tax breaks on \ncapital gains and dividend income that will take $50 billion over the \nnext 10 years and give it to people who are already wealthy. At the \nsame time, the President's budget cuts almost $50 billion from Medicare \nand Medicaid for the next 5 years, harming health care for our seniors, \nfor the disabled, and for the poor. And it robs key funds from other \nhealth priorities as well.\n  Those are the wrong priorities for America, and the motion I offer \ntoday gives the Senate a chance to set things right. My motion says it \nis wrong to give away $50 billion in tax breaks for the wealthy while \ncutting $50 billion from Medicare, Medicaid, and other health care \nneeds.\n  If we are honest about reducing the deficit and strengthening the \neconomy, we need to stop lavishing tax breaks on the rich and start \ninvesting in the health and well-being of all families. Nowhere is the \ncrisis facing working families more apparent than in health care.\n  Overall costs are soaring. Families have been losing their health \ninsurance at the rate of 4,000 people per day--per day--since President \nBush was elected. Close to 2 million Americans in 2001 were involved in \nmedical bankruptcy--an increase of 2,200 percent from 1981. Around 50 \npercent of all bankruptcies in America today are caused, at least in \npart, by illness or medical debts, and of those, 60 percent were caused \nby high medical bills. High drug costs were responsible for half. Most \ninvolved had some health insurance but suffered from coverage gaps. \nOut-of-pocket medical costs averaged $11,854. For cancer patients, out-\nof-pocket costs averaged $35,878.\n  These are not people trying to game the system. In the 2 years before \nfiling for medical bankruptcy, 22 percent of filing families went \nwithout food, 30 percent had a utility shut off, 50 percent failed to \nfill a doctor's prescription, and 61 percent went without needed \nmedical care.\n  Let's look especially at what Republicans are doing to Medicaid and \nMedicare. The Medicaid Program is key to promoting a real culture of \nlife in America. A third of all mothers giving birth receive their care \nthrough Medicaid. The Medicaid Program provides the prenatal and \npediatric care their children need to be healthy. The Medicaid Program \nis our statement that we will do everything we can to help women bring \ntheir babies to term and give them the health care they need as they \ngrow up. That is the way it should be in a true culture of life.\n  But rather than stand by women in their time of need, Republicans are \nabandoning this culture-of-life program. Mere hours after the President \nhad declared in the State of the Union Address that the Government \nwould meet its responsibility to provide health care for the poor and \nthe elderly, the House of Representatives sent to the White House a \nbill to impose draconian cuts on the Medicaid Program.\n  Did the President stand up for this culture of life program and veto \nthe House bill? No. He signed it. According to the Congressional Budget \nOffice, under the Republican Medicaid bill, the poor and the disabled, \nthose with mental illness, will lose: 45,000 enrollees will lose \ncoverage over 5 years; 65,000 enrollees will lose coverage over 10 \nyears; 60 percent of those losing coverage will be children; 13 million \nof the poorest Americans will have to pay more for prescriptions by \n2010; and 20 million will have to pay more by 2015.\n  You may ask where we get these numbers; do they represent what is \ngoing to happen? All you have to do is look at the examples. It is \nalready happening in States across the country. In Maryland, a quarter \nof the families subject to increased premiums disenrolled, and those \npremium increases were extremely modest. In Oregon, higher costs caused \ndisenrollment, and 67 percent of those who disenrolled became \nuninsured. The list goes on. In Rhode Island, nearly one in five \nfamilies subject to the new premiums lost coverage. In Vermont, 11 \npercent disenrolled for nonpayment 1 month after the premiums \nincreased. This is what is happening. This is an attempt to destroy the \nMedicare and Medicaid systems, make no mistake about it.\n  Not satisfied with the cuts in Medicaid already enacted, the \nPresident's budget proposes another $14 billion in reductions in the \nprogram that meets the health needs of the poorest Americans. Some will \ntry to say this does not have any effect on a family's health, but the \nfacts say otherwise. When copayments rise for the poorest, health \ndeclines. This chart reflects a study of the Journal of the American \nMedical Association. It shows that increased copayments for medication \nfor poor families caused an 88-percent increase in adverse events. This \nis from a study by the American Medical Association. The reference is \nprinted in JAMA, the Journal of the American Medical Association. This \nis what happens with copays: a dramatic increase in serious adverse \nevents. You almost have a doubling of adverse events when individuals \nhave a nominal copay of $2 to $3.\n  Look at what happens in this chart: A 78-percent increase in \nemergency room visits when a copay is required. This represents \nemergency visits with\n\n[[Page S1084]]\n\nno copay, and this is with a nominal copay. With $3 to $4 for the \ncopay, we see a significant increase in emergency visits.\n  What is the result? It is going to cost the system a great deal more \nmoney. This is dollar foolish and, from a health point, a disaster for \nindividuals adversely impacted. It will fall on the States and local \ncommunities to pay for this. It is a transfer of obligation. The people \nwho will get hurt are going to be those who have the potential for an \nadverse event or who need prescription drugs in order to prevent a \ndisease from continuing to disable them.\n  This debate isn't about statistics. It is about the real harm these \nsevere cutbacks will do to the most vulnerable Americans. A single \nmother with two children who makes $8 an hour currently pays $3 when \nshe visits the doctor, and she does not have any cost sharing when her \nchildren go to the pediatrician. Under the new law, when her child goes \nto the pediatrician with an ear infection, she may be charged $20. When \nshe goes to a doctor for treatment and tests for diabetes, she will be \ncharged $50, and she will have to pay as much as $832 a year. That is \nwhat you are going to get as a result of Medicaid cuts, as the chart \nbefore showed us. A single mother with two children earning $25,000 a \nyear now pays no premiums or cost sharing for her children's medical \ncare and pays $3 copayments for herself under the existing system. \nUnder the new law, she will now be charged monthly premiums for \nMedicaid coverage for herself and her children. Even if she manages to \npay the premiums, she may now have to pay $40 for a pediatric visit. \nAnd she will have to pay as much as $1,250 for Medicaid.\n  This is the wonderful Republican scenario. We've had no increase in \nthe minimum wage; it has been 9 years and no increase in the minimum \nwage. And we are going to put more pressure on that mother, who is \nmaking $25,000 and has two children, for her family's health care. Why? \nBecause we want some $50 billion more in tax breaks for the wealthiest \nindividuals. That is what this is all about. Being in the Senate is a \nquestion of voting on priorities. The Senate will have a chance to say \nwhether they want to give $50 billion more to the wealthiest \nindividuals, or take that $50 billion and put it right back in the \nMedicare and Medicaid Programs which this President has cut, now and \ninto the next several years.\n  The President's policies, if enacted, will cause serious hardship for \nthe most vulnerable Americans. But the administration's cuts to \nMedicaid are not the only assault on our health plans. The botched \nMedicare drug plan and the President's Medicare cuts further harm \nworking families. When it comes to the new prescription drug benefit in \nMedicare, we had a good Medicare bill in the Senate, supported by a \nbroad, bipartisan majority. Over 70 votes supported it. But that bill \nwas hijacked once the White House entered the negotiations. Ideology \ntrumped common sense. Instead of building on the Medicare Program that \nseniors know and trust, the drug bill was turned over to HMOs and \nprivate insurance plans enticed to participate by massive subsidies, \nfunds that should have gone to strengthen benefits. The result has been \na disaster.\n  But that is not how the administration's spin machine sees it. \nAccording to the budget the President submitted to Congress, the \nMedicare drug program is off to a good start:\n\n       The Medicare prescription drug benefit program is off to a \n     good start.\n\n  I wish those in the administration who thought so had the opportunity \nto visit with seniors in Massachusetts trying to figure their way \nthrough this. My office is filled with letters of the sadness and grief \nfrom individuals who are confused and can't find their way through the \n45 different alternative programs. And as they search, they ask: ``Why \ncouldn't they just give us the prescription drug benefit under the \nMedicare Program? I know the Medicare Program. It takes care of \nhospitalization. It takes care of doctor's fees. I know it. I trust it. \nI support it. I wonder, in these 45 programs, where the Medicare \nProgram is?'' They can search and search and search, and they won't \nfind it because this administration is opposed to it. So the seniors in \nmy State are going to have to fight their way through those 45 \ndifferent programs to find out which one suits them and then, after \nthey sign it, they find out that the program can change the formulary \nand raise the premium. That is quite a deal, isn't it? Once you are \nenlisted, the program can change like that. And if the senior doesn't \nget involved in one program or another, they will pay an extraordinary \npenalty for not becoming involved. Some deal.\n\n  This is off to a good start? This is how it has been described: \n``Prescription for Disaster; Medicare Mess Cuts Cash Flow to \nPharmacists,'' The Washington Times, February 6; ``Medicare Drug \nMess,'' New York Times, January 22; ``Pharmacists Decry Medicare \nChaos,'' the Tennessean, January 17; ``New Medicare [Prescription \nDrugs] Causes Numerous Headaches,'' Chicago Sun Times. This is what is \nhappening: cuts in Medicare, refusing to build on the solid Medicare \nsystem which is tried and tested and proven and would give the greatest \nadvantage to our seniors. That is what the administration is doing.\n  Across the country, seniors and disabled individuals facing the \nchallenge of mental illness have been denied the medications they need \nto maintain their health. They have been forced to pay massive fees for \nthe drugs they counted on. States, cities, and many pharmacies have \nstepped into the breach and incurred millions of dollars in expenses to \nfill the gaps left by the administration.\n  The reality is that 15 million seniors lose under the Republican \nMedicare law. This chart shows what is happening across America today. \nRetirees are being dropped. Low-income seniors are paying more in \npremiums. The dual eligible is also losing. Premiums are costing more \nthan the benefits. This represents another 6 million who will lose \nunder the Republican Medicare law. You add those together, and you have \n15 million beneficiaries who are somehow going to lose. That is the \nreality.\n  Who is going to gain? If all of these seniors and disabled Americans \nare losing, we have to ask: Who wins from the Republican drug plan? \nSomeone must win. The answer is clear. The drug companies and the \ninsurance industry win. The Republicans turned Medicare into the \n``sugar daddy'' for the insurance industry by dolling out $67 billion \nin subsidies. Here is the latest chart: $67 billion, with a $10 billion \nslush fund built in. You also have the overpayment and the risk \ninflator. We know that any individual that is in an HMO program is 15 \npercent healthier than the average Medicare recipient. That is a given. \nCMS knows that. And what did we do? We gave the HMOs the inflator, \nclose to 7 percent, representing an advantage of more than more than 15 \npercent. I thought the private sector was supposed to be more \ncompetitive and was supposed to save money. But instead, we have given \n$67 billion to the insurance industry. Those are the sweeteners in the \nMedicare prescription drug benefit.\n  People back home in Massachusetts ought to understand why they are \npaying more in their copays--because a sweetener was needed for the \ninsurance industry, for the HMOs. Those are the figures.\n  Now what about windfall profits for the drug companies? This chart \nrepresents the difference between the money that is being paid now in \nthis particular Medicare program and what would have been paid to drug \ncompanies if they had negotiated with the administration, similar to \nthe VA system. So now we have to pay $67 billion to the HMOs and $139 \nbillion to the drug companies. That makes over $200 billion, adding the \n$67 billion and the $140 billion, $200 billion, Mr. Senior Citizen. We \ncould have lowered your premiums, lowered your copayments, and gone a \nlong way toward closing what they call the donut provisions in here.\n  Even with all of these sweeteners, we have a disaster. Why? Because \nthe bill blocked Medicare from negotiating the same kind of discounts \nfor seniors that the VA is able to get for veterans. In order to \npromote competition under this part, and in carrying out this part, the \nSecretary may not interfere with the negotiations between the drug \nmanufacturers and the pharmacies and the Prescription Drug Providers. \nThere it is. That effectively prohibited the administration from being \ninvolved. They pay effectively almost what the companies want.\n  Does the administration propose to make things right? Does President\n\n[[Page S1085]]\n\nBush propose to kick the insurance industry and companies out of \nMedicare and provide a real benefit? The answer is ``no.'' Instead of \nstrengthening Medicare, the new budget proposes $36 billion in Medicare \ncuts over the next 5 years and $105 billion over the next 10.\n  The Medicare cuts will mean higher premiums for seniors and the \ndisabled. This will result in reductions in the quality of care at \nhospitals and at home health agencies. In my State of Massachusetts, \nPresident Bush's Medicare cuts will mean that our hospitals will have \nto cut their budget by $213 million, home health agencies by $50 \nmillion, nursing homes by $150 million.\n  Cuts in public health programs mean that our State program to screen \nnewborns as early as possible for hearing loss will be eliminated. \nSeventeen rape crisis centers across the State would face significant \nfinancial hardship. Our programs on violence prevention and suicide \nwould effectively be eliminated. Over 35 programs that train health \ncare providers who deliver care in underserved areas and that support \ndiversity in the health professions will be eliminated. Why should \npatients pay the price while this bill gives away billions in tax \nbreaks to people who don't need them?\n  But, of course, Republicans have never liked Medicare and Medicaid. \nEven though retirees and the poor were hurting, Republicans fought \nagainst Medicare and Medicaid tooth and nail when Democrats fought to \ncreate those two important programs in the 1960s. I was here on the \nSenate floor in 1964 when Medicare was defeated. I was here in 1965 \nwhen the Medicare Program was enacted. Republicans defeated Medicare \nwhen it was debated in Congress in 1964. When Republicans came under \nfire for their opposition in the 1964 election, enough crossed over to \njoin Democrats in passing the Medicare and Medicaid Programs in 1965.\n  Republicans never gave up their opposition. When they gained control \nof the White House and Senate in the 1980s, they tried to break \nMedicaid's promise of health care to poor families. They proposed \nconverting the program into a block grant, and Democrats in Congress \nstopped them only after a pitched battle.\n  Once again, in the 1990s, House Speaker Newt Gingrich and his \nContract With America wanted to eliminate Medicare. Even though seniors \nand Americans with disabilities relied on the program and Americans \nrespected it, Gingrich said Medicare should just ``wither on the \nvine.'' Democrats stopped them again.\n  More recently, Glenn Hubbard, who was President Bush's chairman of \nthe Council of Economic Advisers in his first term, said Medicare and \nMedicaid should be replaced by so-called health savings accounts, which \nwould primarily benefit the healthy and the wealthy. He said:\n\n       There is no reason to have a separate Medicare and Medicaid \n     arrangement if you had these souped-up HSAs.\n       That is the architect of President Bush's health savings \n     account, Glenn Hubbard, proposing to abolish Medicare and \n     Medicaid. That is what this is really focused on, Mr. \n     President. We ought to understand that.\n\n  Meanwhile, the Bush administration and Republicans in Congress \ncontinue to chip away at Medicare and Medicaid. Now they are at it \nagain.\n  In the budget the President just submitted to Congress, no health \npriority is safe. Medicare, Medicaid, cancer research, newborn \nscreening, trauma services for children, and many other essential \nprograms will be severely reduced or even eliminated.\n  Look at this, Mr. President. Here is how these cuts affect the budget \nand undermine medical progress. This is how much they would need to \nhave current services, to keep the inflator in the Medicare \nprescription drug benefit. Take the National Cancer Institute. Right \nnow, we are in the age of the life sciences--with the human genome \nproject, the sequencing of the genome, potential stem cell research, \nand a whole range of different opportunities. Right now, under the \nhuman genome project, researchers are sequencing genes from cancers, \nwhich are the greatest danger to families, using computers and other \nkinds of advanced technology. Those who are involved in this research \nbelieve that it is going to open up such hope and opportunity for the \nfamilies affected and impacted by cancer. Yet we are cutting those \nprograms $208 million.\n  The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute: we are cutting that \n$123 million.\n  What are the reasons for this? To provide additional tax breaks for \nthe wealthiest individuals. This is your choice. Do you think we ought \nto have the investment in cancer research and the Heart, Lung, and \nBlood Institute? At the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive \nand Kidney Diseases, which funds diabetes research, we are cutting \nback. Yet $1 out of $4 from Medicare is now spent to try to deal with \ndiabetes, along with $1 out of $10 Medicaid dollars. That makes a lot \nof sense, doesn't it? Of course it does not make sense.\n  Then there are neurological disorders and stroke and mental health, \nand we are cutting back on understanding these challenges, even as so \nmany young people in this country are suffering with increased rates of \nyouth suicide. We're also cutting back on Child Health and Human \nDevelopment, which is so important.\n  All of this money should go into programs at the National Institutes \nof Health, but instead it is coming out and going right into additional \ntax breaks for the wealthiest individuals in this country.\n  Under the President's budget, NIH will receive $1 billion less than \nis needed to keep up with inflation. Its budget will be flat for 2 \nyears running. That has not been allowed to happen in more than half a \ncentury. Mr. President, 18 of the 19 NIH institutes will lose funding, \nwhich means that NIH will fall behind in the race for new cures. At the \ntime when we are in the life science century, we are cutting back on \nthose opportunities for individuals and families who are affected by \ncancer and Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. Is that what we want to do in \nthe Senate? Is that the vote we want to cast? Senators will have that \nopportunity later on, but I believe it is the wrong priority for our \nNation. The amount saved by these dangerous reductions is dwarfed by \nthe payouts that the tax bill now under consideration in the Senate \ngives to the wealthy.\n  The tax break is particularly unfair because more than 75 percent of \nthe tax benefits will go to people with incomes above $200,000 a year. \nOver half of the benefits--53 percent--will go to people with incomes \nover $1 million a year.\n  This amounts to a $35,000 gift each year from Uncle Sam to the \naverage millionaire, but it is highway robbery for the millions of \nseniors, disabled Americans, and poor families who will see a cut in \nMedicaid and Medicare services.\n  The Republicans cynically claim that capital gains and dividend \nincome deserve special treatment because they will stimulate \ninvestment. The facts do not substantiate that claim. The stock market \ngrew more rapidly in the early and mid-1990s when investors' income was \ntaxed at the same rate as wages. President Bush cut taxes on capital \ngains and dividend income in 2003. More tax cuts that America cannot \nafford will hurt the economy, not help it.\n  There are some provisions in the Senate bill that we need to address. \nThe alternative minimum tax was never intended to apply to middle-class \nfamilies, and they deserve tax relief. In a truly outrageous move, \nHouse Republicans took AMT relief for the middle class out of their \nreconciliation bill so they could fit in more tax breaks for the rich. \nThe research and development tax credit is important to our \ninternational competitiveness and should be retained. However, those \nworthwhile tax cuts should be paid for by rolling back some of the \nextravagant tax breaks that this Republican Congress has already given \nto the Nation's wealthiest taxpayers. We simply cannot afford more tax \nbreaks at a time when we are facing record deficits.\n  If we are honest about reducing the deficit and strengthening the \neconomy, we need to stop lavishing tax breaks on the rich and start \ninvesting in the health and well-being of all families.\n  The economic trends are very disturbing for any who are willing to \nlook at them objectively. The gap between the rich and the poor in this \ncountry has been widening in recent years. Thirty seven million \nAmericans now live in poverty, up 19 percent during this Bush \nadministration. One in five American children lives in poverty; 14 \nmillion children go to bed hungry every night. Wages are stagnant while\n\n[[Page S1086]]\n\ninflation drags more and more families below the poverty line. Mr. \nPresident, 2.8 million manufacturing jobs have been lost, and long-term \nunemployment is at historic highs.\n  The bill before us has the wrong priorities for the Nation. The \nSenate should instruct our conferees to reject any House proposal to \nextend the capital gains and dividend tax cuts. The funds those cuts \nwould consume would be much better spent on Medicare and Medicaid and \nthe Nation's other health needs. The Senate should instruct our \nconferees to follow the right priority and the right course.\n  I know the point will be made at some time during the discussion \nthat, while this is a nice instruction, under the Senate rules we \ncannot really instruct, even if we were able to carry the vote. Even \nthough it involves $50 billion, we can not reallocate funds in this \nparticular way. It is interesting that the $50 billion giveaway for \ncapital gains and dividends is exactly the amount of the cuts for \nMedicaid and Medicare--$36 billion cut from Medicare and $14 billion \ncut from Medicaid.\n  Effectively, what you are doing is continuing the extension of the 2-\nyear dividends and capital gains tax cuts over the period of the \nfollowing 5 years, reaching up to 10 years. This is the $50 billion \nthat we are talking about here.\n  So we know what is really going on, Mr. President. This is an \nopportunity for choice and for making a decision about what priorities \nyou want. We know the continued assault on the Medicare Program, which \nis happening by undercutting that program, is going to mean that our \nseniors are at greater risk. Our children and expectant mothers are \ngoing to be at greater risk with cuts in Medicaid. And by failing to \ndeal effectively with the Medicare prescription drug program, our \nseniors are going to be more poorly served.\n  In 1965, the Medicare prescription drug program was not included for \na very simple reason; that is, 97 percent of private plans at that time \ndidn't have a prescription drug program. Now they do. I was there when \nPresident Johnson signed the Medicare Program. He said: Pay your dues \nin Medicare and your health care needs will be attended to. That is \nwhat the Medicare prescription drug legislation did, right? Wrong. Our \nseniors are not attended to unless they have an effective prescription \ndrug program. They are not getting it with this legislation, Mr. \nPresident.\n  To at least give our seniors the same alternatives for prescription \ndrugs that they have for medical services in the hospital and for \ndoctor's fees under Medicare--to say that we are going to give you \nthese same alternatives under the Medicare prescription drug program--\nis effectively what over 70 Senators voted for in the Senate in a \nbipartisan way. Then that program was effectively hijacked by the \nindustry, as well as by AARP, I might add, which poorly served our \nseniors and now regrets it. We have an opportunity to do something \nabout it. But, Mr. President, without an expression by our colleagues \nhere in the Senate, we are going to see that the rush will be on to \ncontinue the kind of expenditures that will increasingly threaten the \nmost vulnerable in our society: the elderly, the disabled, those who \nare facing challenges with mental health, and the children of the \nNation. Those are not the priorities, I know, for my State. I hope that \nat the time we vote later this evening, they won't be the priorities \nfor the Senate as a whole.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, on Medicare--and I know the debate here \nis not about Medicare, but Senator Kennedy spoke to one part of the new \nprescription drug program to which I wish to make reference. He \nreferred in his remarks to the dual eligibles. He spoke about a problem \nthat is real--the problem of signing up people who were dual eligibles \ninto the new Medicare Part D prescription drug program.\n  I do not find fault with his explanation. I will say, however, that \nour committee which has jurisdiction over this, the Senate Finance \nCommittee, has been working with Secretary Leavitt and Administrator \nMcClellan of CMS to work through these problems. They pointed out seven \nproblems they have identified. They have assumed responsibility for \nthose problems, and they are giving us a program to work through those \nproblems so they will not be repeated and enrollment will by easier and \nwork more smoothly.\n  But the Secretary has told us about dual eligibles, that with 50 \ndifferent States having 50 different ways of handling dual eligibles, \nfrankly, merging the information technology system at the Federal level \nwith the information which came out of 50 different States has been \ndifficult to do.\n  Several of us in the Senate knew this was going to be a problem in \n2003. That is why, in the Senate bill, along with the White House, we \nwanted to leave the dual eligibles just as they were--covered by \nMedicare and Medicaid. It happens that most of the Democrats in the \nSenate, along with Republicans in the House, felt we should end up with \njust 1 national Medicare Program so all of the 50 different States' \ndual eligibles ought to be merged into the national program.\n  We had a debate on the Senate floor on that issue, and my point of \nview won on a very narrow margin. Let me see if I can find it exactly--\na very narrow margin of 47 to 51. We defeated an amendment on the \nSenate floor to bring them together.\n  What bothers me is Senator Kennedy is bringing up all these problems. \nIf he had listened to us 2 years ago, we would not have ended up where \nwe have because we would not be integrating dual eligibles into the \nnational Medicare Program. But people on his side of the aisle were \njust totally insistent that was the wrong way to go, that we ought to \nhave them integrated into the prescription drug Part D Program.\n  So, without embarrassing any Senator, I wish to quote a Democratic \nSenator who was in the middle of this debate. I am not going to give \nthe name. Comments like this came out about how gung-ho they were to \nhave dual eligibles in the Medicare Program. It says:\n\n       It's not a frequent day that Chairman Thomas--\n\n  I assume that refers to Chairman Thomas of the House Ways and Means \nCommittee.\n\n     and I are in full agreement. But he does say such a shift \n     ``ensures that all seniors across the country will have \n     access to affordable prescription drugs, while alleviating \n     much of the burden that states now confront.'' I say to my \n     colleagues, as I indicate, I am not always in agreement, but \n     we are going forward directly on this policy, I hope.\n\n  Continuing to quote:\n\n       Fully integrating a key benefit for prescription drugs into \n     Medicare is a critical first step toward improving the \n     current system's flaws. Not only is it unfair to exclude the \n     poorest seniors from part of the Medicare program, it is a \n     raw deal for some of our neediest seniors. For seniors who \n     have worked all their lives, paid into the Medicare system, \n     it is not fair for them to be at the mercy of State coverage \n     decisions. All Medicare beneficiaries deserve to receive \n     Medicare benefits. There should be no exception for drugs. It \n     would be a very bad precedent to make Medicaid pay for items \n     that are clearly the responsibility of Medicare except at the \n     present and in this bill for one particular discrete \n     population.\n       I think that--i.e., coverage under Medicaid--puts the dual \n     eligibles, 74 percent or less of poverty, at terrible risk, \n     and that is not something I associate with my understanding \n     of the values of the Senator from Iowa--\n\n  Meaning me, I believe--\n\n     whom I so much respect.\n\n  That was on January 23, 2003.\n  On June 26, 2003, this quote was given by the same Senator:\n\n       Never in the history of Medicare have we precluded Medicare \n     beneficiaries from being Medicare beneficiaries. In the \n     underlying bill, for the very first time, we do.\n\n  In that rollcall of 47 to 51, to leave the dual eligibles as they \nwere, which presumably we would not have the problem Senator Kennedy is \ncomplaining about now--that we have a hard time integrating them into \nthe program--he was one of those 47 Senators who thought they ought to \nbe put into the prescription drug program.\n  The reason we left them out is because we wanted to solve a problem \nfor people who did not have prescription drugs, people who were dual \neligibles, already had their prescription drugs through a State/Federal \nprogram, probably to a better point than maybe their having it through \nour bill where they pay some copay. At least in some States, they \nprobably didn't have to pay a copay. We wanted to take care of the \nseniors who didn't have any prescription drug program, and by leaving \nthe dual eligibles as they were, it would free up money to take care of \nmore seniors.\n\n[[Page S1087]]\n\n  As I said, we lost out in the final analysis. In conference, we \nagreed to include the dual eligibles in this program. Now I hear all \nthis complaint about how it is working to the detriment of seniors \nbecause of the integration of 50 different State programs into 1 \nnational program. It will be worked out. It will be worked out. The \nSecretary of HHS, Mr. Leavitt, says it will work out. He is working on \nit. He has identified a solution to it, and every day the signup is \ngetting better as we sign up 94,000 people each day into the Part D \nprescription drug program.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today, we debate this tax reconciliation \nbill for a third time.\n  We last debated this bill on February 2, Groundhog Day. My friend \nfrom Iowa, the chairman of the committee, Senator Grassley, last week \ncompared this repeated debate to Groundhog Day. That is true. This \ndebate does remind us of the wonderful film ``Groundhog Day,'' where \nBill Murray is forced to live the same day over and over again. But at \nthe risk of giving away some of the plot of the film, let me remind my \ncolleagues of the lesson of the film. In the film, providence dooms \nBill Murray to repeat the same day--Groundhog Day, that is--until he \nlearns to live it right. One might say that is where we are. We are \ndoomed to debate tax policy over and over again until we get it right.\n  In November, when we first debated this bill, the Senate voted 64 to \n33 to pass the bill to support AMT relief to middle-income families. \nAgain, last week, the Senate voted 66 to 31 to again pass the bill and \nsupport the alternative minimum tax, otherwise known as AMT, relief for \nmiddle-income families. In particular, the Senate last week voted 73 to \n24 to support the Menendez amendment to express the sense of the Senate \nthat protecting middle-income families from the alternative minimum tax \nshould be a higher priority in 2006 than extending capital gains and \ndividends tax cuts that do not expire until the end of 2008 or the \nbeginning of 2009.\n  So the same question keeps popping up over and over again and the \nsame answer keeps coming back: Let's make sure the relief from the \nonerous and family unfriendly AMT happens now. We must defer on \nextending expensive tax breaks for investors until a later date.\n  Yet I keep reading in the papers that Senate leaders have promised \nthat capital gains and dividends tax cuts will still be in this \nreconciliation bill. The Senate position, by an overwhelming vote of 73 \nSenators, is providing immediate relief to more than 17 million middle-\nincome families that otherwise would see a tax increase this year. \nSince that is so, it seems to me we should accept that position, accept \nthat view, and work toward its enactment.\n  Statements that we will provide AMT relief to working families \nseparately and later in the year undermine this Senate position. It is \nstatements such as those that have led us to this Groundhog Day. It is \nstatements such as that that call into question the Senate's votes and \ncause the Senate to have to vote once again to deliver that same \nmessage. Today, we will debate several motions to instruct, and the \nfirst one will be Groundhog Day for AMT.\n  For 17 million American families, 2006 came with an unwelcome \nsurprise--a stealth tax. The temporary protection from alternative \nminimum tax, or AMT, expired December 31. That means that 17 million \nmore American families will be subject to it this year. That is an \nincrease from 3 million to 20 million taxpayers in one year alone.\n  Once again, the Senate will debate whether to support our position, \nwhere AMT relief is a priority. In contrast, the House position was to \nprefer extending capital gains and dividends cuts, which expire in \n2009; that is, over AMT protection, which expired 6 weeks ago. I think \nthe answer to that is clear.\n  If the House position prevails in conference, working families will \nlose. If we do not extend the AMT protection, a family with three kids \nearning $63,000 will be hit by the AMT this year. The AMT is family \nunfriendly. The AMT creeps deeper and deeper into working families each \nyear. Protection from the AMT should be a priority for both sides of \nthe aisle and both sides of the Capitol.\n  Instead, the House has passed a separate alternative minimum tax bill \nwithout the procedural protections of this bill. And while this other \nHouse bill purports to protect families from the alternative minimum \ntax, there will still be 600,000 additional taxpayers paying higher \ntaxes for this year 2006 due to this stealth tax. The House AMT patch, \nor otherwise known as the hold-harmless provision, as some have called \nit, does not really hold anyone harmless. Last year, 2005, there were \n3.6 million American taxpayers paying this AMT stealth tax. Under the \nHouse bill, there would be 4.2 million taxpayers paying the AMT stealth \ntax in 2006; that is, this year.\n  So as we debate this issue once again, let us remember our priority: \nthat millions of working families now subject to a tax increase \ncourtesy of the AMT are a priority we should address. Once we accept \nthat priority, the decision whether to allocate $50 billion to \nextending capital gains tax cuts becomes much more clear. So let us do \nwhat is urgent first. Let us do what working families expect and need. \nDoing so will be the only way to move on to better days for these \nfamilies.\n  I want to expand on that last point. The capital gains and dividends \ntax cuts contained in the House bill, as I mentioned, are among matters \nmost in dispute in this legislation, so let me take a couple of moments \nto discuss why Congress does not need to extend them in this bill.\n  Under current law, taxpayers who earn money in capital gains and \ndividend income pay taxes on that income at a lower rate than they do \non their ordinary income; for example, wages. In 2003, we passed \nlegislation that set the current law for the taxation of capital gains \nand dividend income. For taxpayers in most income brackets, capital \ngains and dividend income are taxed at 15 percent. Taxpayers in the \nlower two tax brackets do not receive a great deal of capital gains and \ndividend income. But for taxpayers in those two brackets, what capital \ngains and dividend income they receive is taxed at 5 percent now and \nwill be tax free in 2008. Prior law, before 2003, taxed long-term \ncapital gains at 20 percent or 10 percent. Prior law taxed dividend \nincome similar to any other ordinary income, so there is a split in \ncapital gains. The House bill would extend the lower tax rates Congress \nenacted in 2003 to the end of 2010.\n  The first question before us, therefore, is when does Congress need \nto act on capital gains and dividend income tax rates? Those rates do \nnot expire this year. Those rates do not expire next year. Those rates \ndo not expire the year after that. Rather, those rates expire on \nJanuary 1, 2009, about 3 years from now, after the next Presidential \nelection.\n  So the first thing we need to note is that extension of capital gains \nand dividends tax rates is far from an urgent matter.\n  The second question we need to ask is: Is it fiscally responsible to \nextend those tax cuts right now?\n  According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, the cost of a 2-year \nextension of those tax rates amounts to $50 billion over a 10-year \nbudgetary horizon. Some who like lower capital gains and dividends tax \nrates will cite a lower 5-year cost of $20 billion, but that masks the \nfull cost over the decade to come.\n  Perhaps we should be a little more frank with the American people \nbecause it is no secret that many who like lower capital gains and \ndividends tax rates would like to make those lower rates permanent. \nThis is the position the administration takes. So we ought to look at \nthe cost of making those rates permanent. According to the President's \nnew budget request, making these tax cuts permanent would cost more \nthan $200 billion over 10 years.\n  Mr. President, $200 billion is a lot of money. Two hundred billion \ndollars is about what we spend on fighting crime, combating drugs, and \nthe entire administration of Justice for 5 years. Two hundred billion \ndollars is about what the Federal Government spends on highways, \nairports, and the entire Transportation budget for 3 years. And $200 \nbillion is about what we spend on\n\n[[Page S1088]]\n\nveterans' retirement and disability benefits for 6 years. So extending \ncapital gains and dividend tax cuts costs real money.\n  The third question we need to ask is: Are capital gains and dividends \ntax cuts the best use of the money set aside for tax cuts in the \nbudget? For there is a far more pressing need for tax relief before us \nin this bill and that is relief from the onerous alternative minimum \ntax.\n  Millions of working families are beginning their annual ritual of \nfilling out their tax returns. It takes more time than most of us would \nlike, and millions of taxpayers are being forced to fill out their \nreturns twice. They have to do so if they owe money under the \nalternative minimum tax. The need for relief from the alternative \nminimum tax is not some faraway possibility, several years down the \nroad. Relief from the alternative minimum tax expired for the tax year \n2006. That is the more pressing tax relief need before us.\n  Treasury Secretary Snow testified before the Senate Finance Committee \nlast Tuesday. He told the committee:\n\n       Tax increases carry an enormous risk of economic damage. \n     And I can tell you today that the President will not accept \n     that risk. He will not accept a tax increase on the American \n     people.\n\n  That is exactly why we need to prevent a tax increase on those \nworking American families who would be subject to the alternative \nminimum tax, unless we act. In the same vein, the popular research and \ndevelopment tax credit expired at the end of last year. Businesses have \nargued for years that the annual 1-year extension provides no certainty \nfor business planning and investment. We need to extend the R tax \ncredit.\n  Some will make breathless arguments that capital gains and dividends \ntax cuts are necessary. Why are they necessary, they say? They say they \nare necessary to prevent dire consequences in the stock market. They \nsay that the stock market will plunge if we don't enact this in 2 \nyears. It doesn't need to be enacted. They want to enact it because the \ncurrent law is in existence until January 1, 2009. But they say the \nstock market is going to fall.\n  Let us look at the time period starting in May 2003, when Congress \nreduced the dividend and capital gains tax rates. Since then, the stock \nmarket has seen a 14-percent growth. Furthermore, let us look at the \ntime when Congress first cut the capital gains tax rate in August of \n1997. Between then and the time the further cuts were made in May of \n2003, the market grew by 13 percent. Now let us look at the time before \neither the capital gains or dividends tax cuts. Before the 1997 tax \ncuts, capital gains were taxed at 28 percent, much higher than the \ncurrent law, and dividends were taxed as ordinary income, higher than \nunder current law. In those times of higher capital gains and dividend \ntax rates, between the time the Clinton administration took office and \nAugust 1997, did the market grow by 13 percent or 14 percent? No. The \nmarket grew by a whopping 236 percent, far more than the 13 percent and \n14 percent when the lower rates were in existence.\n  So the evidence is not there that lower capital gains and dividends \ntax cuts will lead to increased stock prices. Indeed, one would make \nthe case that other economic factors are much more important to stock \nmarket returns than are capital gains and dividends tax rates.\n  One of those factors is the fiscal responsibility of the mid-1990s. \nAfter President Clinton took office in 1993, Congress and the President \nenacted meaningful, I mean meaningful deficit reduction. We reduced the \nGovernment's demand for scarce capital. We freed up savings to finance \nproductive business investments. And we put the Nation on a path to \neconomic growth. In contrast, financing tax cuts by running greater \ndeficits increases the Government's demand for scarce capital. Deficit-\nfinanced tax cuts take away savings that could be available to finance \nproductive business investments. Increasing the deficit detracts from \neconomic growth.\n  To encourage economic growth, we need to get deficits under control, \nand the first step we can take down that road is to stop making the \ndeficit worse by enacting more tax cuts than we can afford.\n  Capital gains and dividends tax cuts do not expire for 3 years. \nCapital gains and dividends tax cuts cost a lot of money. Capital gains \nand dividends tax cuts are a less-pressing priority than relief from \nthe alternative minimum tax. And the evidence is simply not there that \ncapital gains and dividends tax cuts contribute to market strength. \nThat is not the evidence. It may be somebody's theory, but that is not \nthe evidence.\n  So that is why we do not need to extend capital gains and dividends \ntax cuts today. We can face this issue later. Rather, let us address \nthe more pressing need to extend relief from the alternative minimum \ntax. Let us act responsibly. Let us save capital gains and dividends \ntax cuts for another day.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, Senator Kennedy repeats the old \ndemagogic saw about capital gains and dividends being only tax benefits \nfor the wealthy. The facts are very different. I have two charts here \nwhich will show how wrong he is. One of these charts deals with capital \ngains. The other one deals with dividends.\n  Dividends is the first one to which I make reference because, in the \nState of Massachusetts, you can't have all these wealthy people \nbenefiting from the 15-percent dividend tax instead of what he would \nprefer, the 20-percent dividend tax. Don't forget, again, as I referred \nin my opening remarks, these are year 2003 figures, so it could be a \nlot more than that right now, but these are the most up-to-date \nInternal Revenue Service figures we have.\n  In Massachusetts, we have 589,897 taxpayers who benefit from the 15-\npercent capital gains dividend. Don't tell me that all 589,000 of those \nare millionaires. Massachusetts may be a very wealthy State, but it \ndoesn't have that many millionaires in it. So somewhere along the line, \nSenator Kennedy ought to wake up to the fact that there are a lot of \nmiddle-income and common folks in his State who are benefiting from the \n15-percent tax on dividends instead of having a 33-percent increase in \nthat tax and having it go back to 20 percent.\n  My friend from Montana did make a correct judgment that this is not \nrunning out right now. But the point is that when you are asking people \nto invest to create jobs in America, they have to have the long-term \nview of that investment. If you want to encourage investment to create \njobs, people have to know what the tax law is for the long term, not \nfor the short term.\n  The point is, in order to persecute a few millionaires, Senator \nKennedy wants to punish the many. And the many are the 589,000 people \nin his State who benefit from the 15-percent tax on dividends.\n  Let's go to the number of people in that State who benefit from the \n15-percent capital gains tax. There are 212,000 people in \nMassachusetts--again, I remind you these are 2003 tax year figures \nbecause that is the most up-to-date we have from the IRS. There are \nmore today, probably. But there are 212,000 people in Massachusetts, \ntaxpaying families and individuals, benefiting from the 15-percent \ncapital gains tax. Those are not wealthy people.\n  Again, you get back to the point of whether we ought to persecute the \nfew, the few millionaires he is talking about, persecute them and at \nthe same time punish 212,000 people in the State of Massachusetts. I \ndon't think so. I don't think it is good policy.\n  I hope this Congress is able to have a sensible tax policy that not \nonly includes sensible levels of taxation, but if you look at all the \ndividends that are being paid out today that wouldn't have otherwise \nbeen paid out, you think you would come to a conclusion that is a \nsensible policy because we have tens of millions of taxpayers deciding \nhow the profits of a corporation are going to be spent instead of a few \nthousand chief executive officers of those same corporations deciding \nhow it is going to be spent. When millions of taxpayers are making \nthose decisions, it is going to respond to the dynamics of our economic \nsystem and create more jobs and important prosperity than when a few \ncorporation executives keep all those profits internal in a corporation \nmaking those decisions.\n  I don't think we ought to be persecuting a few to punish the many.\n\n[[Page S1089]]\n\n  When it comes to these motions to instruct, we may have some motions \nto instruct on this side of the aisle that will set the record straight \non what we are trying to accomplish and give people opportunities to \nvote on good economic policy and good tax policy as well as bad \neconomic policy and bad tax policy that we are getting from some on the \nother side of the aisle.\n  In 2003, a bipartisan Congress lowered the top tax rate on dividends \nand capital gains to 15 percent through December 31, 2008, and for low- \nand middle-income taxpayers to 5 percent through 2007 and zero percent \nthrough 2008.\n  I filed six motions to instruct conferees to report back a conference \nreport that includes the extension of these tax rates through 2009 and \nthrough 2010, the same as the House of Representatives has.\n  Critics of this policy claim these are tax cuts for the rich that \nmake a budget deficit worse because they want to persecute the few and \nin the process punish the many. But I filed these motions that are \ngoing to tell the other side of the story; that when you have sound tax \npolicy which encourages the economy to grow, we are also going to \nreduce the deficit.\n  Besides, let me suggest to you that I don't know how it is in other \nStates, but I don't run into very many in my State who are saying I am \nundertaxed, tax me more. But I run into people day after day in almost \nevery one of my town meetings where they are complaining about the \noverspending of the Congress of the United States.\n  In regard to the other side of the story and the motions to instruct \nthat I filed, the lower rates of capital gains and dividends have \nproduced several positive effects. They benefited low- and middle-\nincome families in a meaningful way.\n  Can't you see that when you have a very low tax rate for certain low-\nincome people, as one example? For low- and middle-income taxpayers, it \nwill be 5 percent through 2007 and zero percent through 2008. This is \ngoing to encourage people to save to a greater extent, particularly \npeople who have a lower income and don't have the ability to save.\n  These lower tax rates have reduced the tax burden on senior citizens \nwho rely on their investment incomes during retirement. They have \ncontributed to our economic recovery and continue to help the economy \ngrow. They have made capital investments in America more competitive \nwith the capital investment in other countries. With the globalization \nof the economy, that is something we always have to be cognizant of in \nthis Congress, that you can't have a tax policy that makes our \ncorporations, particularly in manufacturing, uncompetitive with \nmanufacturing overseas.\n  Finally, these tax rates have helped impose transparency and \ndiscipline on corporate managers which is critical to protecting \ninvestments and workers.\n  I may or may not seek a vote on these motions to instruct, but I want \nto go through each one of these points which I made so that when \nMembers come over to vote tonight, they will know some of the rationale \nbehind Republican motions.\n  The lower rates on dividends and capital gains have benefited low- \nand middle-income families in a meaningful way. That is the third time \nI have said that in the last 5 minutes. But we have to get away from \nthis attitude of persecuting a few and in the process punishing the \nmany.\n  I don't know whether they on the other side of the aisle realize it, \nbut when they want to persecute a few millionaires, they are punishing \nhundreds of thousands of people--I guess it is millions of people, if \nyou take all 50 States, but I was making reference to the State of \nMassachusetts.\n  According to the Internal Revenue Service estimates for 2003 tax \nreturn data, about 10 million low- and middle-income taxpayers have $34 \nbillion of income taxed at the 5-percent rate and saved at least $1.7 \nbillion, or about $170 per taxpayer on average.\n  I know what I am going to hear from the other side. Well, $170 is \nnothing. Why don't we let the taxpayers of this country decide whether \nthey would rather spend that $170 or that we ought to spend it for \nthem?\n  I can guarantee if they invest it, or if they spend it, it is going \nto do more economic good than if I spend it for them as a Member of \nCongress. That is the way the dynamics are and the way society works. \nMoney spent by the Government doesn't turn over as many times in the \neconomy as it does if it is spent in the private sector.\n  At these 2003 levels, these taxpayers I have referred to save a heck \nof a lot of money. Don't forget, in 2008 that rate drops to zero \npercent.\n  My motion would instruct the conferees to ensure that Congress won't \nraise the annual tax bill on low- and middle-income taxpayers at the \n2003 levels. That tax increase would be at least $3.4 billion. That is \nan average of $340 per taxpayer.\n  Senior citizens benefit from lower tax rates on dividends and capital \ngains. They have reduced the tax burden for senior citizens who rely \nmore than working people do on investment income, and they need this \nparticularly during retirement.\n  According to IRS estimates for 2003 tax return data, about 57 percent \nof the tax returns for taxpayers age 65 and older had taxable dividends \nincome. That is over 6.5 million tax returns. These taxpayers rely on \ninvestment income, and particularly dividend income in their \nretirement. Low- and middle-income seniors pay tax on this dividend \nincome at the 5-percent rate instead of 20 percent or 15 percent. That \nrate for these low-income seniors is going to drop to zero in 2008. \nOther taxpaying citizens, those with higher incomes, paid at the 15-\npercent rate, but that was instead of paying at the 35-percent rate.\n  We need to instruct the conferees that Congress won't impose a new \ntax on low- and middle-income seniors and more than double the tax on \nother taxpaying seniors in 2009 and 2010. In other words, we need to \ntell the other side to quit persecuting a few because in the process \nyou punish the many.\n  In this particular case, why would they be crying about what we might \nbe doing to senior citizens in one of the recent speeches and then \nstand there and want to increase the tax rates from zero percent to 35 \npercent for some of these people who are senior citizens?\n  Also these reduced tax rates on dividends and capital gains have \ncontributed tremendously to our economic recovery and continue to help \nour economy grow. They reduce the cost of capital for American \nbusinesses and increase return on investment, enhancing economic \ngrowth, creating more jobs, and expanding the tax base.\n  Companies are responding to shareholder demand created by the lower \n15-percent rate on dividends by paying record levels of dividends.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, capital gains \nrealizations increased significantly in 2003, 2004, and 2005, causing \ncapital gains tax revenues to be $62 billion higher over those years \nthan were projected before we changed this law.\n  Don't tell me that $62 billion more coming in, according to the CBO--\nnot a partisan like me; they are nonpartisan--$62 billion more didn't \nbenefit the Treasury and reduce the deficit by reducing taxes. You know \nwhat you get out of this--a growing economy. That means more jobs, and \n44.7 million jobs have been created since this tax policy has been in \neffect. The unemployment rate has dropped during the same period of \ntime from 6.1 percent to 4.7 percent.\n  I feel very strongly, just as the other side wants to persecute the \nfew to punish the many by going after what they call millionaires, that \nwe ought to state the reality: that is, my motion to instruct the \nreality of keeping these tax rates so the economy continues to grow.\n  The progrowth policy will not expire at the end of 2008 or at the end \nof 2009 because investors who need the long-term view of investing know \nwhat the law is going to be and are going to make decisions.\n  The lower rates have done another thing--they have made our \nbusinesses more competitive with the global economy. And other \ncountries around the world, having lower tax rates than we have, have \njumped ahead of our businesses. Even with the United States at 50.8 \npercent, we still have the eighth highest tax rate on corporate income \namong the 30 nations in the OECD. For every dollar an American \ncorporation makes on its U.S. investments, more than half of it ends up \nin Federal and State governments. Without the lower\n\n[[Page S1090]]\n\ndividend tax rate, it would have been nearly 63 cents of every dollar, \nranking second only behind Japan.\n  High taxes on capital investment make the United States less \nattractive compared within investment opportunities in other countries. \nThat costs us jobs. In today's global economy, we should do everything \nwe can to ensure the competitiveness of our businesses.\n  In this process of persecuting a few, the few millionaires, punishing \neverybody, you are punishing the people who need jobs, and who lose \njobs because our businesses can't be competitive because our cost of \ncapital is higher than global competition. Also, there is a benefit to \na motion to instruct for transparency of how a corporation works. The \nlower rates have helped impose transparency and discipline on corporate \nmanagers. That is very important to protecting investors and, \nparticularly, jobs for our workers.\n\n  The high tax on dividends causes corporations to favor debt financing \nover equity financing, leaving more highly leveraged businesses \nvulnerable to economic downturns. High dividend taxes reduce the demand \nto receive and thus the incentive to pay dividends, leading corporate \nmanagers to invest in wasteful and unprofitable projects and to hide \nthe results from their investors and their workers.\n  On the other hand, the reduced tax rate on dividends lessens the \ndisparity between debt and equity financing, thus heightening demand \nfor dividends, thus contributing to more transparency and more \naccountability of corporate managers for their decisions.\n  It seems to me in this post-Enron era, we need to instruct the \nconferees to ensure that the transparency and the discipline imposed on \ncorporate managers by lower dividend taxes and critical to protecting \ninvestors and workers is not threatened by this expiration date in 2009 \nand 2010.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, we next expect to hear from the Senator \nfrom Connecticut, Mr. Dodd, to have a motion to instruct on veterans \nand military personnel. We anticipate thereafter we will hear from the \nSenator from Rhode Island. He will have a motion to instruct on defense \nneeds.\n  I yield the floor so the Senator from Connecticut may send his motion \nto the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n\n                      Motion to Instruct Conferees\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I send a motion to the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending motion is laid \naside.\n  The clerk will report the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Mr. Dodd moves that the managers on the part of the Senate \n     at the conference on the disagreeing votes of the 2 Houses on \n     the Senate amendment to the bill H.R. 4297 (to provide for \n     reconciliation pursuant to the concurrent resolution on the \n     budget for fiscal year 2006 (H. Con. Res. 95)) be instructed \n     to insist on the inclusion in the final conference report of \n     the funding to support the health needs of America's veterans \n     and military personnel contained in section 315 of the Senate \n     amendment instead of any extension of the tax breaks for \n     capital gains and dividends for individuals with annual \n     incomes greater than $1,000,000.\n\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the clerk for reading the full motion. Normally, I \nwould interrupt the reading by the clerk, but I thought it important \nthat those interested in the debate would understand what the motion \nis. This is a motion to instruct the conferees to support an amendment \nthis body passed 2 weeks ago.\n  That evening, my good friend from Iowa, the chairman of the \ncommittee, in an awkward moment--it was a rather complicated moment \ninvolving an amendment--offered a substitute that took the heart of my \namendment without the offsets that were included in my amendment, which \nthis body adopted unanimously on a voice vote.\n  I am offering a motion to instruct the conferees to support that \namendment. I also hope they will reconsider some of the offsets we \nsuggested in the amendment I offered when this matter was debated by \nthe full Senate. I would like to remind my colleagues that the proposal \nI offered the other evening was strongly endorsed and supported by the \nAmerican Legion, a group that certainly understands the importance of \nproviding the support and backing our veterans deserve, particularly \nthose who are returning from theaters of conflict today in Afghanistan \nand Iraq.\n  I ask unanimous consent this letter from the American Legion be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                          The American Legion,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 2, 2006.\n     Hon. Christopher J. Dodd,\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Gentlemen: On behalf of the 2.8 million members of The \n     American Legion, I would like to offer our support of the \n     proposed amendment to the Tax Relief Extension Reconciliation \n     Act of 2005 that would provide for the unbudgeted costs of \n     health care for veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan.\n       The amounts offered by this amendment would be in addition \n     to any other amounts provided for medical care under other \n     statutory provisions and would help to avoid funding \n     shortfalls, such as what took place last year or other \n     problems that arise due to the discretionary funding model \n     currently in place for VA health care. This amendment would \n     also establish a ``Veterans Hospital Improvement Fund'' to \n     provide for improvements in health care facilities treating \n     veterans, including military medical treatment facilities, VA \n     facilities and other facilities (state, local and private) \n     that provide medical care and services to veterans.\n       Again, we appreciate your efforts on behalf of our nation's \n     veterans. Your amendment acknowledges the need for adequate \n     funding to ensure our nation's veterans receive the \n     healthcare and other benefits to which they are entitled.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              Steve Robertson,\n\n                                                         Director,\n                                  National Legislative Commission.\n\n  Mr. DODD. I will have additional inclusions for the Record further in \nthe debate as I lay out the arguments for this motion.\n  This is about priorities and choices. Those involved in public life \nare constantly asked to make choices and establish sets of priorities. \nIt is not easy in many cases. Sometimes the choices are very difficult \nto make. In this case, the choice is a rather easy choice, it seems to \nme, given the facts presented by this motion. The amendment we offered \n2 weeks ago and the substitute offered by the chairman of the Committee \non Finance that this body adopted, provides for $12.9 billion for \ndisability payments to veterans, $6.9 billion for veterans medical \ncare, and $1 billion for veterans health facilities. I will explain \nthose particular items in more detail in a few minutes. Basically, that \nwas the amendment to which this body agreed.\n  The offset proposed in my amendment would have sunset the capital \ngains and dividends tax breaks for only those people making more than \n$1 million a year--which amounts to two-tenths of 1 percent of all \ntaxpayers--99.8 percent of all other taxpayers under our proposal would \nnot have been touched, only those making more than $1 million a year.\n  We suggested that the money saved by not providing the tax break for \npeople in that small group be used to pay for the veterans benefits I \nhave described. The House bill proposes to raise to $64.8 billion the \namount we spend on tax benefits for the income group I have just \ndescribed. We asked instead to reduce that amount in order to \nadequately provide for these veterans benefits.\n  I noticed earlier our friend and colleague, the chairman of the \nCommittee on Finance, referred to today's proceedings as being akin to \nthe movie ``Groundhog Day.'' He stated that this is the third time the \nSenate has debated this bill in one form or another. I appreciated his \ndiscussion. Certainly, I can understand his frustration as the chairman \nof the committee that deals with such an important matter in this tax \nlegislation. He and my colleague from Montana, Senator Baucus, have \nworked very hard on this legislation and would like to see it moved to \nconference. I agree. In fact, his reference to that movie is apt, and I \nendorse it.\n  The movie ``Groundhog Day'' reminds us sometimes in life we get \nanother chance to get it right. That is what we are going to try to do \nthis evening. That is why we are here today, to hopefully get it right \nwhen it comes to paying for urgent priorities\n\n[[Page S1091]]\n\nsuch as the health and safety of our troops and our veterans.\n  I don't know of another constituency group in America--maybe some of \nmy colleagues might argue with what I am about to say, but I don't \nthink there is another group of Americans who deserves as much of our \nattention as people who put their lives on the line for the United \nStates of America every day. Those young men and women who are \nreturning from theaters of conflict, broken individuals, at least in \nbody--amputees, scarred, burned, and suffering tragic injuries of war--\ndeserve every bit of thanks, verbally, we can provide for them. But \nbeyond that, they deserve our support and backing when it comes to the \npriorities of this Nation. I don't think it is asking too much, at a \nmoment like this, to say to two-tenths of 1 percent of taxpayers: How \nabout a break; how about not taking that extra tax break and providing \nfor the veterans benefits that are needed for these young men and women \nwho are coming back from the theaters of conflict.\n  When this bill last came to the Senate 2 weeks ago, I offered an \namendment that would have provided crucial health funds in a fiscally \nresponsible manner to our wounded troops coming home.\n  Tax legislation passed in 2003 calls for spending $43 billion over \nthe next 5 years on capital gains and dividend tax breaks for \nindividuals making more than $1 million a year. The bill proposed by \nthe House of Representatives would raise this number much higher--by \nthis chart I am showing--to $64.8 billion. Instead of spending this \nmoney on the wealthiest two-tenths of 1 percent of the population of \nthe United States of America, my amendment would have used the \nresources to meet our veterans health needs--estimated by Nobel Prize-\nwinning economist Joseph Stiglitz to be $18.9 billion over the next 5 \nyears--establish a $1 billion trust fund for health facilities treating \nwounded and disabled veterans returning home, and reduce the deficit by \napproximately $23 billion. That was the amendment I offered 2 weeks \nago.\n  Regrettably, this Senate did not approve my amendment. We did, \nhowever, unanimously adopt, as I mentioned earlier, a substitute \noffered by my colleague from Iowa, the chairman of the Committee on \nFinance, that still provides these needed funds--just without paying \nfor them, as I and many other colleagues would have preferred. We \nbelieve you ought to pay for it.\n  Once again we are coming back. I regret the need for a ``Groundhog \nDay,'' but because of the procedures we operate under, I am getting a \nsecond chance. In effect, I am giving my colleagues a second chance to \nget this right. Do you believe it is that difficult a choice to make to \nreduce that $64.8 billion that we are about to provide to two-tenths of \n1 percent of the wealthiest Americans, to provide for the basic needs \nof our veterans returning from the theaters of conflict? That is the \nchoice we will make when this vote occurs later today or this evening.\n  The House of Representatives has proposed not only keeping in place \nthe scheduled dividends and capital gains tax breaks enacted in 2003 \nbut adding 2 more years of them. My motion makes no statement about \nthese tax breaks for the 99.8 percent of Americans who will get them. \nBut for the two-tenths of 1 percent of the population that I am talking \nabout, I think, frankly, they could do without this. I will tell you \nwhy.\n  Over the last number of years, we have provided $125 billion in \nbenefits for this very narrow group of individuals. Between the 2001 \nand 2003 tax breaks alone, individuals in this narrow group--the top \ntwo-tenths of 1 percent of the population of our great country--have \nreceived more than $125 billion in benefits under the Tax Code. \nMeanwhile, our soldiers and veterans are being told to go without \nessential items such as body armor and the health care they need and \ndeserve.\n  Again, politics is often about choices. In fact, in most cases it is \nabout choices. What I am offering my colleagues tonight is a choice on \nwhether we continue to underscore what the House has done or what we \nare doing by not paying for the benefits, or do we do what all of us \nwould like to see done; that is, do we properly take care of these men \nand women coming back from the theaters of war.\n  The motion does not ask for the return of any of the $125 billion we \nhave given between the 2001 and 2003 legislation. It simply \nacknowledges the reality that in a time of record budget deficits we \nneed to make some different choices. Do we provide more tax breaks for \na small group that has already received so much since this \nadministration took office, as the House of Representatives proposes to \ndo, or do we meet the needs of a nation at war in properly taking care \nof our wounded and disabled veterans as the funding approved by this \nSenate would do?\n  Over 2,200 men and women in uniform have died in combat in Iraq. Over \n16,000 have been severely wounded in that conflict. But instead of \naddressing their needs fully and adequately, this administration has \nunderfunded veterans medical health care.\n  Let me go back and make a point on tax, so everyone knows what I am \ntalking about. Under the House bill, this is the choice: If we adopt in \nthe conference the House bill and drop this amendment--some suggest it \nwould not make it 10 feet down the hall between this Chamber and the \nHouse--we will be left with the wealthiest benefiting the most by \nextending the capital gains and dividends tax breaks.\n  The average tax cut in 2009, if this bill is agreed to, if you make \n$50,000 or less, will be $11. If you make between $50,000 and $100,000, \nyour tax break is $77. If you make between $100,000 and $200,000, you \nget a $228 tax break. If you make between $200,000 and $1 million, you \nget a little more than $1,300 in a tax break. If you make $1 million or \nmore, you get $32,111 in tax breaks. That is from the Urban-Brookings \nTax Policy Center, their analysis of what would happen under this bill.\n  All we are suggesting is to take care of this by reducing that tax \nbreak for the people making over $1 million a year. I also want to see \nus beef up what could happen for the other individuals in the tax \ncategories. The people making $100,000 and less, to receive $75 or $85 \nin a tax break is hardly what I call a windfall for people in this \ncategory.\n  I come back again to the beneficiaries under the motion I am making \ntoday and how they benefit. In fact, last year the administration \ndevised its fiscal year 2006 VA budget that could only handle 23,000 \nveterans returning from Iraq. This number was drastically too low and \nthe Veterans' Administration had to scramble to meet the needs of over \n103,000 Iraq veterans on top of its already existing patient \nload. Imagine that. They submitted a budget that only provided for \n23,000, and yet over 103,000 actually came back from that theater \nalone, to be added to the already overburdened patient flow.\n\n  Congress was forced, of course, as my colleague may recall, to \nintervene in the middle of the year, and in June of last year we \napproved an emergency spending bill that provided an additional $1.3 \nbillion to address shortfalls in the VA health budget.\n  Now, I must stress that I have the greatest respect and admiration \nfor former VA Secretary Tony Principi and the current occupant of that \npost, Jim Nicholson. I do not envy their jobs, particularly when they \nhave an administration that does not seem to want to step up to the \nplate and provide the kind of backing at the budget office they \ndeserve. They have led their Department with great distinction and have \ncontinued to do the best they can under the circumstances. But they \nhave had a difficult task since the current occupants of the White \nHouse have repeatedly provided them with very, very limited resources.\n  I would like to show as well this article which appeared in the \nWashington Post. I will not read all of it, but I wish to point out a \nparticular commendation for a Republican Member of the House, Steve \nBuyer, a Republican from Indiana, because it was from his insistent \nquestioning at the time of the VA Under Secretary for Health that they \nwere able to determine the $1 billion shortfall existed. Had it not \nbeen for the efforts of Steve Buyer, we may not have been able to \ncorrect the shortfall which existed at the time. From the beginning, \nour colleague, Senator Patty Murray, as a member of the Senate \nAppropriations Subcommittee covering veterans and a lead sponsor of \nDemocratic efforts to restore this amount, also led the charge, later \njoined by Larry Craig of\n\n[[Page S1092]]\n\nIdaho and others in her efforts. That is how the money got back in. But \nif it had not been for these Members, we might still be arguing about \nthe shortfalls that were needed to provide for those people.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Washington Post \narticle be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, June 24, 2005]\n\n           Funds for Health Care of Veterans $1 Billion Short\n\n                         (By Thomas B. Edsall)\n\n       The Bush administration, already accused by veterans groups \n     of seeking inadequate funds for health care next year, \n     acknowledged yesterday that it is short $1 billion for \n     covering current needs at the Department of Veterans Affairs \n     this year.\n       The disclosure of the shortfall angered Senate Republicans \n     who have been voting down Democratic proposals to boost VA \n     programs at significant political cost. Their votes have \n     brought the wrath of the American Legion, the Paralyzed \n     Veterans of America and other organizations down on the GOP.\n       ``I was on the phone this morning with Secretary of \n     Veterans Affairs Jim Nicholson, letting him know that I am \n     not pleased that this has happened,'' said Sen. Larry E. \n     Craig (R-Idaho), chairman of the Senate Veterans Affairs \n     Committee. ``I am certain that he is going to take serious \n     steps to ensure that this type of episode is not repeated.''\n       The $1 billion shortfall emerged during an administration \n     midyear budget review and was acknowledged only during \n     lengthy questioning of Jonathan B. Perlin, VA undersecretary \n     for health, by House Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman \n     Steve Buyer (R-Ind.) at a hearing yesterday.\n       ``We weren't on the mark from the actuarial model,'' Perlin \n     testified. He said that the department has already had to use \n     more than $300 million from a fund that had been expected to \n     be carried over to the fiscal 2006 budget, and that as much \n     as $600 million for planned capital spending will have to be \n     shifted to pay for health care.\n        At a noon news conference yesterday, Sen. Patty Murray (D-\n     Wash.), a member of the Senate Appropriations subcommittee \n     covering veterans affairs and the lead sponsor of Senate \n     Democratic efforts to add $1.9 billion to the VA budget, \n     accused the Bush administration of unwillingness ``to make \n     the sacrifices necessary to fulfill the promises we have made \n     to our veterans.''\n       In a rare display of bipartisanship on the polarized issue \n     of veterans spending, Craig appeared with Murray at the news \n     conference and said he agreed with many of her comments.\n       Murray cited an April 5 letter written by Nicholson to the \n     Senate in a bid to defeat her amendment: ``I can assure you \n     that VA does not need emergency supplemental funds in FY2005 \n     to continue to provide timely, quality service that is always \n     our goal,'' he had said.\n\n  Mr. DODD. We cannot and should not address veterans' needs on the \ncheap again. According to some experts, this year, the VA health system \nis likely to face another shortfall of $2.6 billion due to the \nadministration's drastically low veterans budget. And for all of the \nPresident's rhetoric about supporting our troops--and I do not in any \nway doubt he means it when he says it, but I remain concerned that the \nadministration fails to back up the rhetoric with the kind of actions \nneeded to see to it that these troops are going to get the support they \ndeserve.\n  On the whole, I commend the President for finally proposing an \nincrease of $1.9 billion in the VA budget for 2007. But as in previous \nyears, the administration's priorities are wholly misplaced. In spite \nof the proposed increase, the President's 2007 request cuts the VA \nhospital construction budget by $576 million. To make matters worse, \nthe administration's proposed budget would impose a doubling of \nveterans' prescription drug copays and assess a new $250 enrollment fee \nfor thousands of veterans across our country.\n  As I mentioned on the floor before, the situation has gotten so dire \nthat now our military personnel and veterans are having to rely on the \ncharity of private citizens to build critical health facilities to meet \ntheir needs. According to the Departments of Defense and Veterans \nAffairs, our military personnel are suffering inordinate numbers of \ninjuries resulting in brain damage, spinal injuries, and amputations. \nAbout 20 percent of those injured have suffered major head or spinal \ninjuries and an additional 6 percent are amputees. Without financial \nsupport, our veterans are actually having to depend on the charity of \nprivate citizens to finance the construction of major rehabilitation \ncenters for the most seriously wounded.\n  The Bush administration is simply not meeting its obligations to \nthose wounded in Iraq--a war that has returned home amputees at twice \nthe rate of Vietnam. And so, instead, the Intrepid Fallen Heroes Fund \nis raising $37 million to build the Intrepid Center at Fort Sam Houston \nnext year. It will be manned and operated by VA and Army personnel, but \nit is currently not expected to receive a dime from the U.S. Treasury \nfor its construction because the White House would rather dole out \nscarce resources to the wealthiest of our fellow citizens who have \nalready received so much. What kind of a choice are we making when we \ndo that?\n  I remind my colleagues that the funding approved by this body--which \nwithout the support of this motion I fear will be wiped out in \nconference--will allow critical facilities such as this one to receive \nthe investments they deserve from our Nation's Government.\n  Moreover, it will create a trust fund to allow private and State \nfacilities that provide medical treatment to veterans to receive \nFederal funds as they meet our veterans critical health care needs. In \naddition to facilities such as the Intrepid Center, it will allow vital \nhospitals and veterans residences, such as the Connecticut State \nveterans home at Rocky Hill, the opportunity to tap into vital Federal \nresources as they strain to meet the increasing demands of caring for \nour veterans--young as well as old.\n  I cannot stress the importance of these programs enough. Our veterans \nneed the critical care provided at our State veterans nursing homes \nand, regrettably, this administration is choosing to put scarce \nresources into more high-income tax breaks rather than address our \nveterans' essential living needs.\n  As a matter of fact, last year, the President actually proposed \ncutting off States' access to Federal funds to build and maintain State \nveterans homes. I did not make that up. That is what they proposed. It \ntook an act of the Congress to reverse the President's budget proposal.\n  This year, although the Department has a list of 129--I am going to \nput these in the Record, Mr. President; I want my colleagues to see \nthem--although the Department has a list of 129 State veterans projects \napproved for receiving Federal grants for new construction and \nimprovements, 2006 allocations only provided enough for 13 of these 129 \nState projects around our country.\n  I will guarantee my colleagues, every one of your States is included \nin projects that will not be funded. These are your State veterans \nfacilities, and these are good people out there doing a Herculean job \nof trying to provide for veterans from your States. Here they are, with \n129 requests for projects they need, and only 13 of them will be funded \nbecause we are going to provide a huge tax break for people who have \nreceived $125 billion in tax breaks and are now about to get almost $70 \nbillion more.\n  I would hope my colleagues would just, on this alone, be willing to \nsupport this motion. The proposed 2007 budget would flat-line this \nprogram of State construction at $85 million, providing funding, as I \nsaid, for 10 to 13 projects--it may not even be 13--and still leaving \nover 100 State veterans facilities looking for additional resources.\n  The funding approved by this body and supported by this motion I am \noffering this afternoon would address these shortfalls.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this Priority List of \nPending State Home Construction Grant Applications--it lists the State, \nthe facility in your State; and only the top 13 will be approved; maybe \n13, maybe 10 next year--I ask unanimous consent that this list be \nprinted in the Record so my colleagues can determine whether their \nState facility is on the list.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S1093]]\n\n\n\n                 PRIORITY LIST OF PENDING STATE HOME CONSTRUCTION GRANT APPLICATIONS FOR FY 2006\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                          Priority     Est.

This provides a 180 day time extension\n  authorized in 38 UCS 8135.\n**\\1\\ The State of Texas requested FY 2006 funding consideration for two bed-producing projects (FAI 48-008 and\n  FAI 48-009). Projects FAI 48-010 and FAI 48-011 have PG-1 certification of 35% State matching funds.\nThese applications will be funded in FY 2006 in the order which they appear on this list, subject to the\n  availability of Federal funds and compliance with all Federal requirements. Conditionally approved projects\n  have been ranked and will be awarded grants subject to meeting the remaining Federal requirements.\n\n  Mr. DODD. The funding approved by this body and supported by this \nmotion would address these shortfalls and allow State homes to tap into \na trust fund to provide more funding for construction that has already \nbeen approved by the VA.\n  In light of these facts, I urge my colleagues to consider the \nconsequences of not acting today. Call it Groundhog Day. Call it what \nyou want. But the fact is, we have another chance now to get right what \nwe didn't the other night.\n  Again, I support and appreciate what my colleague from Iowa did by \noffering an amendment to provide for these priorities. But we did not \nprovide any funding for them. And there is not a Member of this Chamber \nwho does not know what is going to happen. They did it as basically a \npolitical cover, to have an amendment which said: Yes, we agree with \nyou, we should be paying for these priorities. But then, when I offered \nthe amendment to pay for them, of course, I lost.\n  Today, you will get a second chance, like in the movie ``Groundhog \nDay,'' to try to get right what we got wrong the other night. You make \nthe choice. If you think $64.8 billion in tax breaks for the two-tenths \nof 1 percent of the American population making more than $1 million a \nyear is a more important priority than providing for State facilities \nthat serve veterans, providing for disability payments and veterans \nmedical care, then you explain that to your constituents. But that is \nthe choice I am going to offer you this evening. Supporting the Senate \nposition on this issue is the very least we can do to show our full \nbacking of America's men and women in uniform. We owe these individuals \nat least that much.\n  I will end where I began. I do not think there is another \nconstituency group in America that deserves as much support from the \nCongress as veterans do. Particularly in this day and age, if you go to \nBaghdad, if you go to Iraq, as many of my colleagues have, as I have--\nand I see my colleague, Jack Reed, in the Chamber as well, a graduate \nof West Point and a veteran of the 82nd Airborne. You go there--and I \nhave gone with him--and you meet these young men and women. It is a \ntough place to be. It is a tough place to be. It is a tough place to \ncome back from, even under the best of circumstances. But if you come \nback physically broken, with arms and legs lost and scarred and burned, \nas 16,000 of them have, you deserve better. If you think millionaires \ndeserve better than they do, I could not disagree with you more. And I \nam going to give you a chance tonight to join me in this effort.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, we are next expected to hear from the \nSenator from Rhode Island, who will have a motion to instruct on \ndefense needs. Thereafter, we expect to hear from the Senator from New \nYork, Mr. Schumer, who will have a motion to instruct on the tuition \ndeduction.\n  To facilitate the consideration of Senator Reed's motion, I ask \nunanimous consent that the pending motions be temporarily set aside so \nthat the Senator from Rhode Island may offer his motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                      Motion To Instruct Conferees\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I send a motion to instruct conferees to the \ndesk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       Mr. Reed moves that the managers on the part of the Senate \n     at the conference on the disagreeing votes of the 2 Houses on \n     the Senate amendment to the bill H.R. 4297 (to provide for \n     reconciliation pursuant to the concurrent resolution on the \n     budget for fiscal year 2006 (H. Con. Res. 95)) be instructed \n     to insist on the inclusion in the final conference report of \n     the funding to strengthen America's military contained in \n     title VI of the Senate amendment instead of any extension of \n     the tax cuts for capital gains and dividends, which does not \n     expire until 2009, contained in section 203 of the bill as \n     passed by the House of Representatives.\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I find myself, as I so often do, agreeing \nwith my colleague, the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Dodd. It is \nexactly about priorities. It is about whether the wealthiest, most \naffluent people in this country will enjoy a tax break or whether more \nfundamental needs of our Nation will be served.\n  Senator Dodd pointed to the issue of returning veterans. Again, I was \npleased to travel with Senator Dodd last October to Iraq to visit with \nour soldiers: marines, airmen, sailors--all of our outstanding men and \nwomen in uniform. When they come home, they need the kind of support \nthat the fund Senator Dodd identified would give them. But there is \neven a more immediate concern to our Armed Forces today: $50 billion in \nequipment that has to be rehabilitated, refurbished, brought up to \noperating conditions, so these men and women can continue their \noperations on behalf of America.\n\n[[Page S1095]]\n\n  I can tell you, as someone who had the privilege of commanding a \ncompany of paratroopers, the most disconcerting concept, the most \ndisconcerting and troubling aspect, is when your equipment is poorly \nmaintained, will not operate, is inefficient, out of date. That drives \nmorale down as rapidly as anything. We have--not unexpectedly because \nof the conflict in which we are engaged--seen our equipment stocks \nbecome overused, both aviation equipment and ground equipment: trucks, \nvehicles, humvees--all of them have taken a terrible beating in combat \noperations in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n  Just 2 weeks ago, this body agreed with my proposal to spend $50 \nbillion to refurbish this equipment. But as Senator Dodd pointed out, \nthey did not agree with the way we would pay for it. In fact, the \nproposal was really just oratory. It says: Let's spend $50 billion \nwhich we do not have to help the military refurbish their equipment. We \nhave to do better than that because, as the Senator pointed out, \nwithout funding, that is all well-wishes without real results. And we \nneed real results for the men and women of our military forces.\n  The administration is quick to point out that we are a nation at war. \nThat is true, although in some respects we are simply an Army and a \nMarine Corps, the Department of Defense, at war because the American \npeople have not been called upon to sacrifice very much, if anything. \nHere we are making the point--I think it is so obvious--that the \nwealthiest Americans, those who enjoy the benefits of this great \ncountry, I believe would be quite willing to give up their tax break on \ndividends and capital gains if they knew these funds would be directed \nto precisely the programs I am talking about: refurbishing military \nequipment or caring for veterans.\n  There are many reasons to oppose the extension of the lower tax rates \nand dividends and capital gains, many macroeconomic reasons, many \nreasons in terms of our fiscal problems and in terms of our growing \ndeficit. But one of the reasons is just the way it is distributed. \nForty-five percent of the tax cut goes to .3 percent of families with \nincomes of $1 million or more. Seventy-two percent of the tax cut goes \nto families with incomes of $200,000 or more.\n  Now, in a time when our troops are being sent into the field--at \ntimes they are complaining or have complained about inadequate \nequipment, insufficient equipment--at a time when they are looking \naround and seeing their equipment stocks being drawn down and being \noverused, I believe it is time to ask: What is our priority, the \nprotection of our military forces in the field or providing additional \nbenefits to those who have so much in society today?\n\n  I think it is more important to direct these funds to our military \nforces. We have to do it, particularly with respect to the equipment of \nthe Army and the Marine Corps. As Senator Dodd indicated, I had the \nprivilege of traveling with him last October, but I just came back from \nmy seventh trip to Iraq and fourth trip to Afghanistan. Once you are \nthere, you understand the professionalism, skill, valor, fidelity to \nduty and country of these marvelous men and women. You also understand \nthat the equipment is wearing down. The equipment has to be fixed. \nBecause they depend upon this equipment for their lives, we can't \ntolerate equipment that won't operate properly.\n  A recent article in USA Today noted that the war in Iraq has taken \nthe biggest toll on military equipment since the Vietnam war. Two weeks \nago, the National Security Advisory Group, chaired by former Secretary \nof Defense William Perry, released a report about the strain and risk \nto our military.\n  In their words:\n\n       Given the harsh environment of Iraq and Afghanistan, \n     [resetting the force]--\n\n  that is, rehabilitating this equipment and repairing it--\n\n     is proving more extensive and expensive than in previous \n     operations. Estimates of the costs of rehabilitating Army \n     equipment coming back from operations overseas continues to \n     grow . . . in addition, both the Army and the Marine Corps \n     expect to see increasing costs associated with recapitalizing \n     aging forces and transforming their capabilities for a \n     broader range of 21st century missions.\n\n  Gary Motsek, the Army's deputy director for support operations at the \nU.S. Army Materiel Command, has stated that the Army has to repair \nvirtually everything that goes to Iraq.\n  Last week, General Schoomacher, the Chief of Staff of the Army, \nappeared before the Armed Services Committee. When I asked him what the \nreset and recap cost for the Army was, he replied: $4 billion per year \nover the next 6 years. What I have since discovered--and this might be \nof some confusion in terms of trying to interpret a difficult and \ncomplicated budget--is that his reply doesn't cover the whole situation \nand doesn't provide an entire explanation of what is going on.\n  First, I believe the Chief of Staff was discussing the repair and \nreplacement cost, which is projected to be $24 billion over the next 6 \nyears. He did not include recapitalization which is an additional $12 \nbillion over the next 6 years. So the actual projected cost over 6 \nyears is $36 billion. Second, this projection assumes a significant \ndrawdown of troops beginning at the start of fiscal 2007 and ending in \nDecember 2008, when there are, according to the projections, no troops \nin Iraq. I believe this assumption is rather unrealistic and, \ntherefore, we must assume that the reset and recapitalization costs \nwill be significantly higher. Again, it is very difficult to parse out \nall of the different assumptions and other notions that are included in \nthe budget, but the sense is that they are assuming, at least when it \ncomes to maneuver units, that these units will essentially be drawn \ndown within 2 years. That is a highly problematic assumption, but one \nthat is within the President's budget.\n  In addition, General Schoomacher's number assumes that we do not \nleave a single piece of equipment behind for the Iraqis. Yet I have \nbeen privy to discussions here in Congress and elsewhere in which there \nis a notion that we will leave significant equipment behind in Iraq to \nprovide their security forces with the kind of equipment they need to \noperate. If we do leave equipment for them, the replacement costs, \nwhich are an element of reset and recap costs, will increase.\n  A much more accurate picture of this notion of what we must do to \nrepair and rehabilitate our equipment, or reset and recap, is the \nactual bill we have for fiscal year 2006, what we are paying for in \nthis fiscal year. The Army has determined that the cost of resetting, \nrecapping, and replacing equipment lost in battle for fiscal year 2006 \nis $13.6 billion. As long as we have approximately the same number of \ntroops in Afghanistan and Iraq as we do today, and we have the same \ntempo of operation, then that $13.6 billion cost will be an annual \noccurrence. As troops draw down, that funding level could go down from \n$13.6 billion, but significant costs will continue to accrue until 2 \nyears after the end of the conflict. So the annual $13.6 billion price \ntag supports the opinion of GEN Paul Kern, who just retired as head of \nthe Army Materiel Command. He stated that fixing and replacing Army \nequipment alone could run from $60 to $100 billion.\n  If you step back and look at what we are encountering today in terms \nof costs, it is about $13 billion. Every year we are in Iraq at this \nlevel of operational strength, it will be roughly that. That is a lot \nmore money than this budget anticipates. And so we have a huge unmet \nneed to fund simple recapitalization and reequipment, rehabilitation, \nwhatever term you want to use. But essentially, so that we understand \nit, it is simply going back and fixing all the equipment we have been \nusing so aggressively in these different theaters. That doesn't buy you \na new Army. It doesn't buy you a transformed Army with new, modern \nequipment. It simply gives you back the equipment you brought into \nbattle in a condition that you can use it in other hostile \nenvironments.\n  This $13 billion seems to be the kind of level of spending we are \ngoing to have to face year in and year out, as long as we are deployed, \nas we are, in Iraq and Afghanistan. That is the figure we have to react \nto. As a result, it is only prudent and sensible that for this $50 \nbillion total we talked about for a 5-year period, that people support \nthe concept of spending that kind of money. But, of course, what they \nrefuse to do is put real assets, real resources to pay the bills. And \nthat is the thrust of my proposal.\n  I tried previously, in our debate a few days ago, to say that not \nonly must we\n\n[[Page S1096]]\n\nspend this money, we have to set priorities. We have to take those \nfunds from the capital gains and dividends taxes and apply them to this \nfundamental need of our men and women in uniform.\n  That is the Army I was just talking about. Let's turn to the Marine \nCorps. Last November, the Marine Corps estimated it would cost $11.7 \nbillion to repair and replace their equipment over the next 5 years. \nThese are, again, costs that have already been incurred. These costs \nare not included, as far as we can determine, in the President's budget \nrequest. We have also discovered that the Air Force is concerned about \nthe cost of additional flying hours and the wear and tear on their \nequipment. Again, we could not find explicit recognition of these costs \nin the President's budget.\n\n  Last October, the GAO released a report on military readiness. It \nassessed the state of 30 pieces of equipment, predominantly tanks, \nvehicles, helicopters, and aircraft. It made several disturbing \nobservations, stating:\n\n       GAO's analysis showed that the reported readiness rates \n     declined between fiscal years 1999 and 2004 for most of these \n     items. The decline in readiness, which occurred more markedly \n     in fiscal years 2003 and 2004, generally resulted from 1. the \n     continued high use of equipment to support current operations \n     and 2. maintenance issues caused by the advancing ages and \n     complexity of the systems. Key equipment items--such as Army \n     and Marine Corps trucks, combat vehicles, and rotary wing \n     aircraft--have been used well beyond normal peacetime use \n     during deployments in support of operations in Iraq and \n     Afghanistan.\n\n  The report then goes on to say:\n\n       Until the DOD ensures that condition issues for key \n     equipment are addressed, DOD risks a continued decline in \n     readiness trends, which could threaten its ability to \n     continue meeting mission requirements. The military services \n     have not fully identified near and long term program \n     strategies and funding plans to ensure that all of the 30 \n     selected equipment items can meet defense requirements.\n\n  I don't think there is anything startling in the sense of their \nconclusion. They are stating what should be obvious. We have committed \nour Army and Marine Corps to battle in a very harsh environment, Iraq \nand Afghanistan. We are operating at robust tempos of operation. This \nequipment is seeing the results. We have to provide for that. What is \ndisturbing to me is that this readiness trend portends danger in the \nfuture. If readiness is declining, if it is not reversed, if we are \nasking the soldiers and marines to operate equipment that is not 100 \npercent, that is not fully supported by ample spare parts, that has not \nbeen rehauled, overhauled, rehabilitated, then we are putting our \ntroops in a precarious position which we should not.\n  The response, the answer? This one is relatively straightforward. \nGive them the money to do the job and give them sufficient resources to \ndo so.\n  Another GAO report states that more than 101,000 pieces of National \nGuard equipment, including trucks, radios, and night vision devices, \nhave been sent to soldiers in operations overseas. This means the Guard \ndoes not have the equipment it needs to respond to crises here. This \nproblem was exemplified during Katrina when the Guard stated that its \ncommunications equipment had been abroad and, therefore, it was unable \nto operate effectively in the aftermath of that disaster.\n  Another impact that we all hear about is the condition of National \nGuard equipment. Their equipment has been sent overseas and left \noverseas. Their equipment is also being used intensively in these \noperations. We have to restore and rehabilitate the National Guard \nequipment also. They have several missions. One critical mission is not \nonly homeland security but preparedness for natural disasters and \nconsequent management.\n  This week, Wednesday, the other body will release a report on \nKatrina. I am interested to see what it will say in terms of the \nNational Guard's ability to respond, their equipment, the fact that \nthey have been tasked to go overseas, personnel and equipment. But we \nhave to remind ourselves that we can't neglect the Guard also. These \nreports, the GAO reports particularly, should have us thinking \nseriously about what we must do today. Again, it comes down to \npriorities. Secretary Rumsfeld is right about the fact that our troops \nare performing magnificently well. They are superb professionals doing \na remarkable job. But in order to keep that edge, they have to have the \nequipment and the support to be the best they are.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld says that Perry report and another report by Andy \nKrepenevich, which the Pentagon paid for, were looking at all material \nwhen they found that the military was strained. We are not looking at \nall material. We are looking today at what we believe, based upon \nreview of the budget, based upon discussions with military personnel, \nis the condition of this equipment, and the need exists to fix it. We \ndo have the finest fighting force in the world, but we have to make \nsure it has the finest equipment in the world.\n  Secretary Perry made the following recommendation at the conclusion \nof his report:\n\n       In order to restore the health of U.S. ground forces in the \n     wake of Iraq, the nation must step up and invest substantial \n     resources to reset, recapitalize, and modernize the force . . \n     . Restoring the health of both services is not a matter of \n     simply returning them to the status quo; it is a matter of \n     that they are organized, trained, equipped, and restored to \n     meet the full range of traditional and nontraditional \n     challenges in the future.\n\n  Next year alone the Army needs about $13.6 billion and the Marine \nCorps needs about $7.5 billion for reset and recap, as they call it, of \ntheir equipment. This was not included in the President's budget \nrequest. If it is not paid for with supplemental funding, the troops \nwill have to go without, which we can all agree is not acceptable. \nNothing makes our troops more vulnerable or lowers morale more rapidly \nthan working with inadequate equipment. If the $20 billion reset and \nrecap bill for this year alone is paid for with supplemental funding, \nthis will add directly to our deficit. I believe with the growing size \nof this deficit, we should not add to it, that we should do what we can \nto try to prevent increased deficits.\n  This is a time for Americans to come forward to share in the \nsacrifice of our men and women overseas. Particularly when it comes to \na tax proposal that benefits the wealthiest Americans, I think we would \nbe more than willing to do so, knowing that these funds could be used \ndirectly for the welfare of our soldiers in the field and for the \nsecurity of the United States.\n  Our men and women have volunteered to risk their lives. I believe we \nhave to risk perhaps a little political capital and instead of \nproviding these tax cuts to the very wealthiest Americans, provide a \ndividend to our soldiers and marines in the form of better equipment. \nFifty billion in funding retained from not extending capital gains cuts \nand dividends cuts could pay for this. That is the essence of my \ninstruction.\n  It is one thing to stand on this floor as a huge majority and say: We \nunderstand our troops need $50 billion to rehabilitate their equipment. \nIt is something else to stand up and make a tough choice, set a \npriority, pay for it. My instruction will do that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, people call Montana the ``big sky'' State. \nStanding on the top of Mount Sentinel--the backdrop of the University \nof Montana--on a clear day, a person can see nearly 50 miles in almost \nevery direction. I might say that at the top of Lone Mountain in Big \nSky, MT, you can see the Tetons in Wyoming. Back at Mount Sentinel, \nwhich many of us climb from time to time, at the foot of it a professor \nis studying a horizon that stretches much farther than 50 miles. \nProfessor Dan Reisenfeld is one of the key astrophysicists working on a \nmission to map and study the edge of the solar system.\n  Professor Reisenfeld is busy playing a part in the design of the \ninterstellar boundary explorer, or I-BEX, an instrument that uses a \nlarge-aperture camera to detect high-energy particles coming from the \nedge of the solar system.\n  What does this mean? If I-BEX is successful at gathering information \nabout the boundaries of the solar system, this will help companies that \nbuild satellites orbiting the Earth to predict solar storms. Solar \nstorms can disrupt a satellite's operation and even cause irreparable \ndamage.\n  Here on Earth, that means that emergency communications equipment \nwould be able to function without the fear of interruption. And global \ncommunications can be more seamless.\n\n[[Page S1097]]\n\n  Some of the most important scientific research is being done at \nuniversities across Montana and across the country. This research \ncovers the gamut from biotechnology to stem cell research, to cutting-\nedge computer science. But institutions across the world are catching \nup.\n  In January, I visited India's Institute of Technology in Delhi. \nEager, young engineering students are plotting for a better tomorrow in \ntheir country and the world. India, similar to many other developing \ncountries, has made significant investments in education over the past \nseveral years. India produces 12 percent of the total global supply of \nuniversity graduates. This percentage is increasing. China is now \nsecond only to the United States in the number of researchers in its \nworkforce. According to the World Bank's most recent statistics, since \n1985, China has seen an almost 400-percent increase in its per capita \neducation spending.\n  While China, India, and other developing nations may still have a \nlong way to go, they are training workers for a new world.\n  That takes me back to Professor Reisenfeld at the University of \nMontana. The University of Montana, similar to most colleges and \nuniversities across the country, is a tax-exempt organization. Tax-\nexempt universities rely in large part on tax deductible charitable \ncontributions from alumni, private foundations, and businesses.\n  Legislative proposals that encourage more giving to charity help \nprovide scholarships, build science centers, and hire new faculty to do \ncutting-edge research. In large part, charitable donations from the \nprivate sector--business and individuals--help America keep its \ncompetitive edge. There is no doubt about that, Mr. President. Our \nuniversities are a very key, integral part in America's R and in \nenhancing our country's competitiveness.\n  The Senate-passed tax reconciliation before us includes several \nincentives to encourage charitable giving. One of the most important \nincentives for charitable giving included in the Senate-passed bill is \nthe IRA rollover provision. According to the American Council on \nEducation, the IRA rollover provision is supported by close to 2,000 \ncolleges and universities across the country. The provision promises to \nbe an important tool for planned giving--a staple of university \nfundraising.\n  In addition, the IRA rollover represents a significant simplification \nover current law. Let me explain.\n  The IRA rollover provision allows older, financially secure donors to \nseamlessly transfer amounts in their IRA to their favorite charity, \nwithout first recognizing the IRA into income.\n  Under current law, taxpayers who want to donate their IRAs to charity \nmust first take the amount into income. This can cause a huge \ndisincentive to give if the amount of the IRA exceeds the donors' \nadjusted gross income limitation, for example.\n  In some cases, donors are forced to incur income for tax purposes for \namounts the donor has given to charity. This makes no sense. The law \nshould encourage taxpayers to give to charity.\n  For example, a taxpayer with an adjusted gross income of $40,000 and \nan IRA worth about $100,000, is forced to take that full $100,000 into \nincome prior to making a gift to charity.\n  As a result, this taxpayer is considered to have $140,000 in income, \nfor tax purposes--even though the taxpayer is giving $100,000 away.\n  Because taxpayers are subject to adjusted gross income limitations, \neven if the donor gives the entire $100,000 in the IRA away to charity, \nthe taxpayer can only deduct up to half of adjusted gross income--in \nthis example, $70,000.\n\n  In short, under current law, this taxpayer is forced to recognize \n$30,000 more in taxable income, even though the IRA is going entirely \nto charity. We should not penalize charitable giving.\n  The IRA rollover provision corrects this problem by simply \ndisregarding from income amounts in a donor's IRA given to charity.\n  This proposal will have a fundamental effect on the amount of money \ncontributed to charity. Currently, there are more than $2.5 trillion \nheld in IRAs. If 1 percent of the assets currently held in IRAs were \ndonated to charity, that would mean an additional $25 billion would go \nto benefit the type of research conducted by Professor Reisenfeld at \nthe University of Montana. And money would also go to scholarships for \nthe students working side by side with Professor Reisenfeld in his \nclassroom.\n  The House bill does not include these new charitable giving \nincentives. Mr. President, the upcoming conference will highlight the \npriorities of each body. We include this provision; the House does not.\n  It is unclear at this point whether there will be enough revenue to \nextend capital gains and dividend tax treatment beyond the current law, \nwhich we all know doesn't expire until January 1, 2009, and also \ninclude the important charitable incentives included in the Senate-\npassed bill.\n  I hope that the conference committee makes charities and our future \nscientists its priority.\n  Mr. President, I want to discuss the importance of extending the R \ndevelopment tax credit for 2 years.\n  This is one of the key issues for conference. The Senate passed a 2-\nyear extension of the revised and improved R credit, but the House \nonly passed 1 year.\n  I am hopeful that 2 years will be retained in conference, as this tax \nincentive is essential for U.S. businesses in our global economy. \nBusinesses depend on it. They need to know it is there. Predictability \nis important.\n  I have consistently discussed the need for America to maintain its \ncompetitive edge. To do that, we must cater to our strength: \ninnovation.\n  Let me state that during the almost 2 weeks I was in Asia, China, and \nIndia in January meeting with business leaders and public officials, \none thing became clear; that is, sure, there is a rising Chinese and \nIndian challenge, just as other countries challenge the United States, \nbut they constantly told us that in the private sector the one \nadvantage America still has is innovation, creativity. Over and over \nagain I heard that. I hope that lasts. I hope it lasts a long time. We \nknow people in other countries are working very hard; they are \naggressive and hungry and they are going to do all they can to be as \ncreative--if not more so--as we are in the United States. But that is \nthe one edge we have currently, and we must do our utmost to make sure \nthat lasts.\n  Foreign direct investment, including research and development, is \nshifting heavily toward China and India. The competition for qualified \nresearchers has increased markedly.\n  On my recent trips to China and India, people constantly told me, as \nI have said, that the one thing they admire most about America is our \ninnovation. We must foster R, and extending this vital credit for 2 \nyears would help maintain that focus.\n  Every morning we hear news of some new product or discovery that \npromises to make our jobs easier and our lives better. For example, \nbetween 2002 and 2003, the annual number of cancer deaths decreased for \nthe first time in 70 years. Unfortunately, for women, it rose slightly, \nbut the annual number of cancer deaths has decreased. One reason for \nthat was better detection and treatment. That is a direct result of \nAmerican technological innovations, and those result from R\n  Since 1981, when the research and development credit was first \nenacted, the Federal Government has been a partner in R And we \ncontribute to this effort as a society because of the benefits to \nsociety from additional research spending. It is a societal effort to \nget a societal benefit.\n  Congress clearly believes that the R credit is an effective policy \ninstrument. One of the major limitations of the credit, however, is its \ntemporary nature.\n  As the Electronic Industries Association wrote:\n\n       An extension of the credit that goes beyond the end of this \n     year will also help diminish the uncertainty for companies \n     regarding the availability of the credit.\n\n  The organization goes on to say:\n\n       The yearly fight to ensure that the credit is available for \n     costly and high-risk research done in the United States can \n     cause companies to discount the credit's long-term value and \n     reduce its benefit to the economy.\n\n  An analysis by the Joint Committee on Taxation found:\n\n       A credit of longer duration may more successfully induce \n     additional research that would a temporary credit, even if \n     the temporary credit is periodically renewed.\n\n\n[[Page S1098]]\n\n\n  U.S. workers who engage in R activities benefit from some of the \nmost intellectually stimulating, high-paying, high-skilled jobs in the \neconomy. My own State of Montana is an excellent example of this \neconomic activity.\n  During the 1990s, about 400 establishments provided high technology \nservices, at an average private wage of about $35,000 a year. These \njobs paid nearly 80 percent more than the average private-sector wage \nof less than $20,000 per year during the same time. Many of these jobs \nwould never have been created without the assistance of the R credit.\n  The R tax credit is vital to the economic development of our \ncountry. It is very important to American businesses. It is very \nimportant to American workers. It is important to help America maintain \nour competitive edge.\n  I urge my colleagues to support a 2-year extension of the R credit. \nI hope you will join me in pressing our House colleagues to accept this \nSenate provision.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, what a difference 5 years makes. On March \n21, 2001, the Finance Committee conducted a hearing entitled ``Budget \nSurpluses and Debt Reduction.'' When we held that hearing, the Office \nof Management and Budget projected a surplus of about $5.6 trillion \nover the next 10 years. A lot has changed since then.\n\n  At the end of this past December, Treasury Secretary Snow sent us \nletters asking us to raise the debt ceiling for the fourth time in the \nlast 4 years. The Government is now seeking to raise the debt ceiling \nby $781 billion. This is on top of a $450 billion increase in 2002, a \nrecord $984 billion increase in 2003, and an $800 billion increase in \n2004. With the latest debt limit increase, the Government will have \nraised the debt ceiling by $3 trillion in just 4 years. Remember, 5 \nyears ago, OMB projected a surplus of about $5.6 trillion for the \nfollowing 10 years.\n  Something needs to change. We have a serious problem with our Federal \nbudget. For the current year, the administration's budget projects a \ndeficit of $423 billion. That would be the highest deficit in the \nhistory of the country. That deficit would equal 3.2 percent of the \nentire economy. While that percentage is not a record, it is far too \nhigh, with the baby boom generation about to retire just around the \ncorner. The retirement of this large generation will dramatically raise \nthe costs of Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. Their retirement \nwill put enormous pressures on the budget.\n  We should rather be entering this stressful period with a balanced \nbudget. We should be paying down the debt. We should be getting ready. \nWe should not be running record budget deficits. We need to change \ncourse. We need to return to the policies and procedures that helped \nreduce that $5.6 trillion surplus.\n  One of those procedures was the pay-as-you-go rule. That rule made it \ndifficult for Congress to enact new spending or tax cuts without paying \nfor them. That simple rule had a powerful effect, but that rule ended a \nfew years ago. Congress replaced it with a newer, toothless version, \nand we have paid the price in higher deficits and debt. Congress must \nreinstate the original pay-go rule.\n  Beginning in 1990, we also enacted policies to reduce deficits and \ndebt. First, following a budget summit, Congress enacted the deficit \nreduction package of 1990. Then, in 1993, in the first year of the \nClinton administration, we narrowly enacted a $500 billion deficit \nreduction package. What happened? Long-term interest rates dropped. \nEconomic growth ensued. The deficit came down.\n  Finally, both parties worked together again in 1997 and enacted \nanother deficit reduction package. That package was intended to balance \nthe budget by 2002.\n  But economic growth was strong. These years were a part of the \nlongest peacetime economic expansion in American history. The \nGovernment balanced its budget in 1998, earlier than expected, and then \nthe Government balanced the budget even without using Social Security \nsurpluses. It is incredible, if you stop and think about it.\n  That set the stage for the projections of 2001, with a $5.6 trillion \nsurplus for 10 years. But now we are projecting huge deficits and debt \nfor both the long term and the near term. The time has come for leaders \nof both parties to work together to achieve another agreement to reduce \nour deficits. But in order to be successful, we need to put everything \non the table, and I mean everything. We need to put all spending, not \njust entitlement spending, on the table. We need to put all corporate \ntax loopholes and tax breaks for special interests on the table, and we \nneed to put the $350 billion yearly tax gap between revenues owed and \nrevenues collected on the table.\n  I don't know the answers, but I do know we cannot keep on going as we \nare. Something has to change. We need to come together to reduce \nFederal deficits. The task is clear, and I can only hope and pray all \nour leaders will take up the task.\n  Mr. President, in Proverbs, King Solomon begins by offering words of \nencouragement to the Israelites to embrace learning:\n\n       Let the wise hear and gain in learning, and the discerning \n     acquire skill.\n\n  A little later in the passage Solomon admonishes:\n\n       Fools despise learning and wisdom.\n\n  I hope the upcoming conference committee will take this proverb to \nheart. It is past time for this country to start taking education \nseriously again, and be ready to make investments in our children's \nfuture now. Delay would be foolish.\n  The Senate-passed bill takes a step in the right direction by \nincluding a provision to eliminate the barriers in the Tax Code to the \ncharitable giving of books to schools, libraries, universities, and \nliteracy programs. Educational institutions and literacy programs are \nbeset by budget cuts and continued challenges to our Nation's \ncommitment to literacy. Two-thirds of American classrooms have fewer \nthan 50 children's books, and almost 60 percent of childcare centers \nbuy less than 1 book per child a year.\n  This is not just an issue in the classroom. Almost 12 million \nchildren living below the poverty level in the United States today are \ngrowing up with minimal access to books. According to First Book, a \nnonprofit that focuses on child literacy, more than 60 percent of low-\nincome families have no children's books in their home, and more than \n80 percent of programs serving children in need have no age-appropriate \nbooks or other printed materials.\n  In my home State, as in many other States, there is a real need. In \n2003, according to the Montana State Library Association, the Montana \nState library system was a victim of a 26-percent budget cut. These \nreductions mean less money for local libraries, and these reductions \nmean cuts in State subsidies that funded book purchases.\n\n  Large-scale book donations are crucial to these libraries, and these \ndonations also greatly assist adult literacy efforts. Programs such as \nthe Montana Adult Basic and Literacy Education, or ABLE, serve adults \nwho lack sufficient mastery of basic skills to function in society, a \nhigh school diploma, or basic English skills. ABLE is meeting real \nneeds. According to the State agency in charge of adult literacy in \nMontana, nearly 75,000 adults in Montana do not have a high school \ndiploma or GED.\n  Because of the tremendous need for books in Montana and across the \ncountry, I filed an amendment in the Finance Committee with Senator \nHatch to include incentives for book donations in the Senate-passed \nbill. Here is how it works.\n  Current law provides special tax incentives for gifts of property \nincluding books to certain organizations. Current law, however, \nrequires the donor to make the gift targeted solely to the ill, the \nneedy, or infants, categorized as children under the age of 18.\n  Unfortunately, books donated directly to educational programs at \npublic libraries and universities are not eligible for that tax \ndeduction. Why? Because they don't exclusively serve the ill, the \nneedy, or infants.\n  In addition to the exclusion of those institutions, donations are \nsometimes\n\n[[Page S1099]]\n\ndiscouraged when the differences in educational and commercial market \nelude the IRS when valuing the donation. If book donations do not \nqualify for the enhanced deduction, the value of the deduction for \ncharitable giving is no more than what they would give if they merely \nthrew them away. As a result, it is often more economical for \npublishers to truck these books to a dump than it is to distribute them \nto needy schools and libraries, especially given the manpower and \npostage costs of determining worthy donees and shipping books.\n  In the Senate-passed bill, we have provided legislative language to \nensure that public libraries, universities, and literacy programs are \neligible with enhanced deductions that already exist in the Tax Code \nfor other kinds of charitable donations.\n  To protect against publishers making unwanted donations of dated \nmaterials, the provision includes a requirement that organizations \ncertify the materials are suitable and appropriate for their \neducational programs.\n  In addition to organizations in Montana such as ABLE, many gulf area \ngovernment agencies that are in desperate need after Hurricanes Katrina \nand Rita have written us petitioning for this change. We have heard \nfrom the Mississippi Department of Education, Louisiana-Mississippi \nschool and library systems and library associations, as well as the \nTexas Library Association and Mississippi's Barksdale Reading \nInstitute. Numerous national educational organizations have written us, \nincluding the American Library Association, the Education Industry \nAssociation, and the Association of Educational Publishers.\n  The lack of access to books poses the greatest barrier to literacy. \nWe shouldn't allow books to be taken to the landfill because of an \nunintended obstacle in the Tax Code, particularly when one considers \nthe massive loss of books along the gulf coast.\n  I might add, I was down at the gulf coast. I was standing next to a \nlibrary that was obliterated on the gulf. There were books strewn open, \nand you could see where a cake of mud was left after the water receded \nand we were standing on ruined books. You won't believe this, but I \nreached down to pick up a book and look at it to see what it was, and \nout of all of the books, guess what its title was. ``A Perfect Storm.'' \nI couldn't believe it. It was pure happenstance, pure coincidence, but \nI can tell you that having visited the gulf, they need books.\n  As students and families make the slow return to the gulf and an \nincredible effort to rebuild their communities, it is necessary to \nremember that equally important to the rebuilding of these important \ninstitutions is the need to restock them with sufficient numbers of \nbooks and quality education materials.\n  As First Lady Laura Bush said on September 24 last year, it is our \nduty to ``rebuild these schools on the Mississippi coast and in New \nOrleans and make sure the libraries are built better and stocked even \nbetter than they were before.''\n  The book provision in the Senate-passed bill would help restock \nschools from the gulf to Montana and across the country. As the First \nLady admonished, this is our duty. I hope the conference committee \nagrees.\n  Mr. President, continuing in a series of statements prefacing the \nconference and other measures that might be coming up later this year, \nI wish to spend a moment on health savings accounts.\n  High-deductible health plans and health savings accounts, otherwise \nknown as HSAs, have become the centerpiece of the administration's \neffort to reform the health care system. In fact, the proposed budget \nwould spend an additional $156 billion over 10 years to encourage more \nAmericans to choose these plans and accounts.\n  I am concerned that high-deductible plans will do more harm than \ngood, and the billions of dollars the President wants to spend on \nbeefing up the limits on HSAs, health savings accounts, will not \nbenefit those who need coverage the most and can least afford it. That \nis because HSAs favor the healthy and they favor the wealthy. As \nhealthy insureds join these arrangements, the average cost for those \nremaining in comprehensive plans will increase, and that will make \ncomprehensive plans less affordable for those who need coverage.\n  Do HSAs favor those who are healthy and can afford something? Let me \nquote from the High-Deductible Health Plans and Health Savings Accounts \nWorksheet, found on the Federal Government's Office of Personnel \nManagement Web site. This worksheet is designed to help Federal \nemployees decide whether to use plans such as these which are now part \nof the Federal employees health benefit plan. Step three of this \nworksheet reminds us that preventive care is not subject to the high \ndeductible. Then it goes on to say:\n\n       Absent other health care needs, if you contribute a higher \n     amount to your HSA, you will get a higher tax deduction plus \n     a higher balance in your HSA to use for future expenses. \n     Since your out-of-pocket costs before plan benefits begin \n     also defines the maximum amount of personal, tax-deductible \n     contributions you can make, contributing a larger amount \n     isn't necessarily bad. If you use a relatively low amount of \n     health care and you can afford to make the maximum \n     contribution, you may be attracted to these aspects of HDHPs \n     with HSAs.\n\n  That is high-deductible health plans and the health savings account. \nThis is what it says in the Federal brochure for Federal employees: If \nyou use a relatively low amount of health care and you can afford to \nmake the maximum contribution, you may be attracted to it.\n  If we enacted the higher HSA contribution limit proposed by the \nPresident's budget, the attraction of HSAs for those who are healthy \nand can afford to contribute the maximum would only grow stronger. Why? \nBecause that statement was written before the proposal that the \nadministration has before us, to dramatically increase the deductibles \nand eligibilities of those plans which I think are basically investment \nvehicles, not health vehicles.\n\n  Billie Holiday sang, ``Them that's got shall get, them that's not \nshall lose''. That's a pretty good description of the effect of \nexpanding HSAs on our health care system.\n  Some may argue that this preference of healthy, well-to-do taxpayers \nfor HSAs would not be a problem if we just put everyone into a high-\ndeductible plan and eliminated more comprehensive arrangements. \nEliminating choice takes care of adverse selection. If there were no \nchoice, and therefore no adverse selection, would expanding HSAs be a \ncost-effective solution? Would tax dollars spent on expanding HSAs go \nto increase coverage and control costs?\n  Let us say, for the sake of discussion, that we force everyone, \nhealthy or not, into a high-deductible health plan with a $1,500 \ndeductible. And let's go further, and put $1,500 into an HSA for \neveryone, so ability to contribute is not a factor. Wouldn't that \naddress my concern that the President wants to spend money on the \nhealthy and wealthy instead of focusing on those who need help most?\n  The answer is, no, not as HSAs currently operate. And certainly not \nwith the President's proposed increase in the contribution limit.\n  To illustrate my concerns, let's consider two taxpayers--Jane and \nJohn, both 30 years old. Jane is healthy. John has a chronic condition \nthat requires him to take medications every day and occasionally pay a \nmidnight visit to the emergency room.\n  Every year, $1,500 is deposited to Jane and to John's HSA accounts. \nEach year, John must withdraw his $1,500 contribution to pay out-of-\npocket medical expenses. Jane only has to withdraw about $500 a year, \nleaving the other $1,000 to accumulate for retirement.\n\n  Over the next 35 years, if Jane can earn 5 percent investment return, \nshe will accumulate an HSA account balance of more than $90,000. If the \nPresident's higher contribution limits were in place and Jane could \nafford to contribute the maximum to her HSA, she could have more than \n$400,000 in her HSA at retirement. Because he had to use his HSA \ncontributions to pay medical expenses, John will retire with a zero \nbalance in his HSA.\n  In other words, the President's health tax proposals may or may not \nexpand health coverage and will do little to control costs. But they \nwill definitely create retirement savings for the healthy.\n  I am all for retirement savings, but using tax dollars to increase \nretirement savings for individuals with low medical expenses is a \nstrange and ineffective approach to covering the uninsured, and \ncontrolling health care costs. Surely we can do better.\n\n[[Page S1100]]\n\n  Mr. President, I am going to stop speaking pretty soon here. I very \nmuch hope Senators come to the floor with motions to instruct because \ntime is passing. Just because I am speaking, it doesn't mean someone \ncan't come to the floor. If anybody comes to the floor, I will stop \nspeaking.\n  Mr. President, Yale Law School professor Michael Graetz once said:\n\n       A tax shelter is a deal done by very smart people, that, \n     absent tax considerations, would be very stupid.\n\n  A GAO study estimated that tax shelters cost the American taxpayer up \nto $18 billion a year in lost revenue.\n  There must be a lot of very smart people out there putting together \nsome very stupid deals.\n  We have all heard about some of these deals.\n  We know them as the Enron scandal, the KPMG scandal, the German SILO \nsewer system scandal. The list goes on.\n  These deals are like the legendary retail scam used by con artists to \ncheat cashiers out of extra change. It's called the ``short count.'' \nLike a tax shelter, it involves smart cons and stupid deals.\n  There are several steps to the cash register scam. First, the con \nartist buys something that costs less than $1, and he gives the cashier \na $10 bill to pay for it. When the cashier hands back the change, the \ncon artist offers to give back ten $1 bills in exchange for the $10 \nbill he used to make his original purchase.\n  Now, the trick is that the con artist must get the cashier to give \nback the original $10 bill before he gives up his $1s. Quickly, before \nthe cashier notices, the con then substitutes the $10 bill the cashier \njust handed him for one of the $1 bills. He hands the cashier nine $1 \nbills and one $10 bill, for a total of $19.\n  When the cashier notices the con artist gave her too much money, the \ncon acts surprised.\n  Because he's such a ``nice guy,'' he offers to give the cashier \nanother $1 to add to the $19 so the cashier can just give him back a \n$20 bill.\n  The con then leaves the store with a tidy $10 profit, while the poor \ncashier is left holding the bag.\n  When she tries to reconcile her register at the end of the day, \nshe'll have a gap of $10. She will probably end up paying the $10 out \nof her own pocket.\n  I don't know if you follow that. It's a little complicated, isn't it? \nThe con artist is a pretty smart guy who took advantage of an \nunsuspecting cashier. He took a routine transaction and turned it into \nsomething complicated and stupid. Yet, all those steps, all that \nshifting of money back and forth, didn't add one iota of substance to \nthe transaction.\n  We call the guy who duped the cashier a con artist. But, we call \nlawyers, accountants and financial advisors who get involved in tax \nshelters ``tax professionals.''\n  We call the victim of the ``short count'' scam the cashier. But, we \ncall the victims of tax shelters ``innocent American taxpayers.''\n  Individuals who invest in tax shelters to avoid paying their fair \nshare of taxes shift their tax burden onto the backs of hard-working \nAmericans who do comply with our tax laws.\n  The IRS estimates that 85 percent of taxpayers pay the taxes that \nthey owe. Investors in tax shelters are part of the other 15 percent.\n  Eighty-five percent of American taxpayers are carrying the tax load \nfor the noncompliant 15 percent.\n  This is not right. This is not fair. We cannot allow this to \ncontinue.\n  We need to finish up the work that we started in the American Jobs \nCreation Act. That bill beefed up laws against tax shelters. It \nincreased penalties for wrongdoers.\n  We need to pass legislation that will clarify the economic substance \ndoctrine. Clarifying the economic substance doctrine will put an end to \nthe erratic and inconsistent court decisions that have determined the \nlegitimacy of tax shelters.\n  The economic substance doctrine is a common-law doctrine that courts \nuse to deny tax benefits on transactions that don't provide a \nmeaningful change to the taxpayer's economic position other than the \ntax benefit itself.\n  In other words, the doctrine requires that a transaction must have \neconomic reality and a business purpose apart from the tax \nconsequences.\n  The proposed change clarifies how the courts should apply this \ndoctrine. It doesn't require them to use the doctrine. But if they do \ndecide to use the economic substance doctrine, the change would give \nthem standardized criteria to use as litmus tests to decide if a \ntransaction has any real economic purpose.\n  The Senate has passed this proposal several times, most recently in \nthe tax reconciliation bill before us today. But it has never passed in \nthe House.\n  We need to stop batting this proposal around. We need to make it into \nlaw.\n  The economic substance doctrine exposes transactions that use the Tax \nCode in an unintended way to avoid paying taxes.\n  Clever accountants, attorneys, and financial advisers deliberately \nmanipulate the Tax Code to design and sell abusive transactions. At \nfirst glance, the deals stand up to scrutiny. At first glance, they \nappear to comply with the literal language of the Tax Code. They are \nvery complicated. But when you give the deals the smell test, they give \noff a very bad odor. It is clear this is not what the law basically \nintended.\n  You realize that they have no purpose other than to avoid or evade \ntaxes. They have no real business purpose and no economic reality. They \nshift money and paper around using complex arrangements that have no \nreason to exist, except to create nonexistent losses or false \ndeductions.\n  They are smoke and mirrors, a cleverly designed illusion, to fool the \nIRS and to cheat the rest of our Nation's taxpayers, who properly \nreport their income and pay what they owe.\n  That's where the economic substance doctrine comes in. Its standards \nof economic benefit and business purpose allow the courts to pierce the \nfacade of legitimacy to determine if a deal has any real economic \nsubstance.\n  The courts have employed the economic substance doctrine countless \ntimes. But their decisions have been inconsistent.\n  This is due, in large part, because they lack a specific framework of \nguidelines and principles within which to apply the doctrine.\n  The courts are divided on what to do.\n  Some look only to the form of the transaction. They limit their \nanalysis to the four corners of the Tax Code, no matter how crazy the \nresult.\n  Others look beyond the form to the substance of the transaction and \nconsider whether the tax result is consistent with congressional \nintent.\n  It is the role of Congress to pass legislation clarifying the \neconomic substance doctrine to resolve these inconsistencies and \nuncertainties. The legitimacy of a tax transaction in California should \nbe evaluated in the same way as a transaction in Florida.\n  Reliance on isolated and diverse judicial decisions does not lead to \neffective tax administration. Litigation is expensive both for \ntaxpayers and the IRS. Tax professionals will shop around for the most \nadvantageous court case to justify an egregious position. We all know \nthat there is forum shopping. They are going to go to the judge who is \nmost lenient.\n  We need to provide clarity and certainty.\n  Congress's failure to enact this legislation sends an implied message \nthat we don't take abusive transactions seriously. Tax professionals \nknow that we cannot keep all the holes in the dike plugged up by \ndealing with each abusive scheme on a piecemeal basis.\n\n  With our proposed change, we are not reinventing the wheel. We are \nonly improving it. The economic substance doctrine has been part of the \nfabric of our tax system since the case of Gregory v. Helvering in \n1935. It has been around. It has to be consistently applied to minimize \ntaking advantage of the Tax Code.\n  Our proposal merely articulates the way many of the circuits have \nalready applied this longstanding judicial doctrine.\n  Codification will strengthen this important standard that has been \neroded by conflicting and confusing case law and by the greed of many \npractitioners who are willing to overlook it in exchange for profit.\n  We must give the courts a reliable and consistent standard to use \nwhen considering the economic substance doctrine. Failure to do so \nprotracts the cat-and-mouse game that taxpayers, the IRS and the courts \nhave played for years.\n  You might ask: If passing a law to clarify the economic substance \ndoctrine will stop this kind of abuse to our\n\n[[Page S1101]]\n\ntax system, why hasn't it happened? That's a very good question.\n  Unfortunately, there are powerful critics against the proposal, \nincluding the American Bar Association and the Bush administration.\n  Our legislation provides a framework of consistent and standardized \ncriteria to apply to the economic substance tests. The courts retain \ncomplete autonomy and flexibility to decide whether or not to use the \ndoctrine in the first place.\n  The critics, however, argue that the courts will ``lose flexibility'' \nto evaluate transactions.\n  They say that ``an explicit and comprehensive statutory test'' is a \nbad thing.\n  In truth, their position would maintain the status quo. Their \nposition would keep the law broad and vague. And their position would \nperpetuate the same environment that has fostered tax shelters, tax \nschemes, and other abusive transactions.\n  Taxpayers have a right to plan their taxes so that they don't pay \nmore than they legitimately owe. This legislation is aimed at those \ndeals that cross the line into manipulation and abuse--not smart tax \nplanning.\n  The critics say, unfairly, that the Senate proposal is ``overbroad'' \nand could cast doubt on ``legitimate tax planning.'' They say that this \nprovision will be ``ineffective'' because taxpayers will just find a \nway to work around it by crafting their deals with apparent business \npurpose and economic substance.\n  But if the legislation is as ``inflexible'' and ``overbroad'' as they \nsay, how can it possibly leave room for taxpayers to work around it?\n  The proposal that Chairman Grassley and I included in this tax \nreconciliation package provides standardized principles to use as \nguidelines to clarify when a transaction is abusive.\n  It will reduce rogue interpretations of the Tax Code and promote \nconsistency and certainty instead of the existing confusion.\n  Critics argue that it promotes uncertainty because there is no clear \nline of demarcation between what passes muster and what doesn't. \nIgnoring the provision's standardized guidelines, they suggest that the \nproposal gives the IRS and the courts too much power--that it provides \nopportunities and incentives to find transactions ``abusive at will.''\n  In reality, it does just the opposite.\n  And that's exactly why some of the opponents of this measure don't \nlike it. They want to keep the power and flexibility to design and sell \ntax shelters and other transactions that pillage our tax system.\n  There's an old saying that the best defense is a good offense. That \npretty much sums up the opposition to this proposal. Like the tax \nshelters they peddle, their arguments lack substance.\n  We should not stand idly by as a few con artists peddle their scheme \nand take advantage of honest taxpayers. We should plug this loophole in \nthe law.\n  We should urge the House to agree to the Senate-passed provision.\n  I urge my colleagues to work together to get this passed for the \nbenefit of the American taxpayers, most of whom are honest and decent, \nand they are paying their fair share and do not like at all these con \nartists making millions and forcing the good, honest, paying taxpayers \nto subsidize those con artists and those companies taking advantage of \nit.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me respond to the kind invitation of the \nranking member of the Finance Committee, on which I sit, to speak to \nthe matter that is before us. I appreciate listening to his remarks \nabout various aspects of the reconciliation tax bill and features \nthereof. Let me speak to some of those items as well.\n  There will be a lot of debate, I suspect, over the next several \nhours--much of which has very little to do with the Senate bill--but I \nthink in anticipation of what is likely to occur in the conference \ncommittee when the Senate bill joins up with the House bill and we \ndecide what provisions to take from each of those bills and bring back \nto our respective bodies.\n  Clearly, discussion about the capital gains and dividends extension \nwill be part of that discussion. Let me start with that.\n  I want to begin by noting that the budget resolution which the \nconference reached in April provides reconciliation protection for $70 \nbillion in tax reductions over 5 years with the direction that the \nallocations be used to prevent tax-rate increases during the budget \nwindow, which is 2006 to 2010.\n  Let me repeat that. The instruction that we gave for this budget was \nto prevent tax-rate increases during this budget window. If we do not \ntake action, there will be tax-rate increases during this budget \nperiod.\n  This, as the President said in his State of the Union speech, would \nbe both unanticipated and very unwelcomed by the American people.\n  What exactly do we mean by that?\n  Talking about capital gains and dividends, what we did back in April \nwas send a signal to investors that capital gains and dividend tax \nrates would be extended through 2010. Investment advisers have been \nalerting their clients that in their planning they must consider that \nthe tax rates have not yet been extended and may, in fact, expire in \n2008.\n  The conference agreement that comes back to our respective bodies \nneeds to extend these investment tax rates to give these investors \ncertainty and to give businesses certainty about how they raise funds \nto expand their operations.\n  When Secretary Snow testified before the Finance Committee a week \nago, he said it was his opinion that the investors in the country, \nthose people who helped create jobs by investing in our businesses, had \nalready determined that it was likely these tax rates would be \nextended.\n  He said, if we do extend them, which we anticipate doing, that is \nbuilt into the market right now. But he said if we should fail to do \nso, we could anticipate that the market would react very negatively to \nour failure to do so. The reason, of course, is obvious. Investors want \nto know what the return on their investment will be 3 or 4 years out. \nThat is when they will likely turn the asset that will provide the \nprofit or a deficit for them. They want to know what that return is \nlikely to be, which means they want to know what the tax rate is.\n  The tax rates that will expire in 2008 do not tell them what they \nneed to know.\n  We have the opportunity to extend those tax rates through 2010 and \nprevent an increase from occurring, and that is precisely what we ought \nto do.\n  It is interesting that these particular taxes are very important to \nthe majority of taxpayers in the country. These are not the so-called \ntax cuts for the rich. These are a continuation of existing tax rates \nfor a majority of tax filers.\n  More than half of all Americans own stocks, either directly or \nthrough mutual funds. The 2003 marginal rate cut on investment income \nworked by giving investors an incentive to put more of their money to \nwork in the markets. At the lower rates, the tax penalty imposed on the \nadditional investment earnings, the reward for taking on additional \nrisk, is smaller than before, and it makes the risk more attractive.\n  When investors get to keep more of their reward, they are encouraged \nto invest more. With more investment, businesses have an easier time \nattracting the capital they need to expand, create new goods and \nservices, and also create new jobs.\n  It is all part of this additional economic activity that creates this \neconomic growth.\n  Americans support the extension of these tax rates.\n  A recent poll by the Pew Research Center, released on January 24, \nfound that ``half of Americans support extending reductions in taxes on \ninvestment income such as capital gains and profits from stock \ndividends, while 35 percent believe these tax cuts should not be \nextended.''\n  I intend, by the way, to support extending the tax cuts by 34 \npercent, 35 percent. The reason is very apparent--\n\n[[Page S1102]]\n\nbecause it benefits millions of taxpayers.\n  These lower rates have helped millions more taxpayers than other \npopular tax provisions; for example, the alternative minimum tax relief \nthat we want to enact as well.\n  Let me do a comparison between the AMT, which both Senator Baucus and \nI would like to see repealed, how many people would benefit from our \nrelief from the alternative minimum tax versus how many would gain \nrelief from an extension of current rates on capital gains and \ndividends.\n  It turns out, of all taxpayers that pay the AMT--these are figures \nfrom the 2003 tax year, which is the last year--9.7 percent had \nadjusted gross incomes under $100,000. Meanwhile, of all taxpayers \nreporting capital gains in 2003, 67.5 percent had adjusted gross \nincomes under $100,000. Of those reporting dividend income in that \nyear, more than 70 percent had adjusted gross incomes under $100,000.\n  Nationwide, fewer than 8 million filers would be helped by the AMT \nhold-harmless provisions, while nearly 20 million filers would be \nhelped by the dividend relief that we would extend, and just over 7 \nmillion filers would be helped by the relief from capital gains.\n  Here is the bottom line: A lot of Americans--over half--are now \ninvested in the stock market. A lot of people will receive benefits if \nwe continue the current tax rates for dividends and capital gains. Over \n20 million of these filers under $100,000 will have dividend income and \nover 7 million will have capital gains income. That is compared to \nthose taxpayers whom we will help under the AMT relief that we provide \nof about 8 million filers.\n  The bottom line is, other than the wealthy in our country, we are \ntalking about helping people with both kinds of relief, but far more \nwill benefit from the capital gains relief, and especially the dividend \nrelief, than will benefit from the AMT relief. Some of our colleagues \nunderstand that and say: We understand in terms of pure numbers there \nare a lot more taxpayers, especially in the lower income categories, \nwho will benefit from dividends and capital gains relief than AMT \nrelief.\n\n  What about the fact that maybe they do not get as much relief, that \nthe dollar amount is not as much? There is a myth floating around that \nit is actually very low. In fact, there is something being quoted as \nIRS statistics--and they are not IRS statistics. They are from a report \nof a group called the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and also \nthe Brookings Institute Tax Policy Center, which claims IRS data shows \nthe taxpayers with income of $50,000 or less only receive a benefit of \n$11 per return from the lower rates on dividends and capital gains, and \nthe benefit for taxpayers with income under $75,000 would only be $77 \nper return.\n  That is just plain wrong. First of all, the data is not from IRS. \nWhat is the data from IRS showing? Mr. President, I ask unanimous \nconsent a couple of charts be printed in the Record after these remarks \nto show what I am talking about.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. KYL. The IRS statistics--and this comes specifically from table \n3.6, 2003, of a report called ``Individual Income Tax Returns, Returns \nwith Modified Taxable Income: Taxable Income and Tax Classified by Each \nRate at which Tax Was Computed and by Marital Status.'' If you look \nunder that table, what you will find is that based upon actual IRS data \nestimated from 2003, the people who had taxable income of less than \n$50,000 on a per return basis, saved about $171 each. In 2008, the tax \nrate is reduced from 5 percent to zero for these taxpayers. Based upon \nthe same data, that allows the rate to expire, which would result in a \n$341 tax increase on each of the almost 10 million taxpayers in these \ntwo lowest income tax brackets if we do not extend this tax rate at its \ncurrent level.\n  What are we saying? If we do not take action and extend this current \nrate, what we are going to have for these lower income tax payers, \nthose who make $50,000 or less, is they will see a $341 tax increase on \neach of those almost 10 million taxpayers. That is a far cry from this \nfigure of $11, which is simply wrong.\n  The bottom line is, not only will more taxpayers receive relief under \nthe extension of the capital gains and dividends part of what we hope \nwill be the conference report than those who receive AMT relief, it \nwill be substantial relief. If we allow these rates to expire, there is \ngoing to be a substantial tax increase on these people in the lowest \nbrackets, those making $50,000 and below. They will see a $341 tax \nincrease. I would call that real money. I call that amount of people \nreal people.\n  I mentioned before the people making $100,000 or less. What about \nthose making less than that? If you look at those with adjusted gross \nincomes of $30,000, for example, with regard to dividends, 19.2 percent \nof the people reporting dividends were in that income category. With \nrespect to capital gains, likewise, at that lower adjusted gross income \nof $30,000, 18.5 percent of those reporting long-term capital gains \nwere in that category.\n  The bottom line is, whether you are talking about less than $100,000, \nless than $30,000--I mentioned the amount of money received from those \nmaking less than $50,000--whatever category you are looking at, you \nbetter extend the current rates or there will be millions and millions \nof these low-income taxpayers receiving a big hit on their taxes.\n  Let me be very plain. We are not talking about additional cuts in \ntaxes. What we are talking about is just keeping the existing tax \nrates. If we do not extend them, millions of low-income Americans are \ngoing to see a huge increase in their tax bill; one that is \nunanticipated, unappreciated. We cannot afford to allow that to happen.\n  I hope we could agree, those who agree there should be relief from \nthe alternative minimum tax, that we also need to continue to provide \nthe relief from the dividends in capital gains taxes as well.\n  In addition to talking about this in terms of American families, it \nis important to understand what this has done for our economy. The fact \nis, all taxpayers, all workers in this country, all people who have \njobs, all benefit from the economic expansion that has occurred largely \nas a result of the tax policies the President has proposed and to which \nCongress has agreed. It would be folly to allow those tax policies to \nexpire.\n  What kind of impact have these tax policies had on the gross domestic \nproduct? Whether you embrace these lower rates or not, you have to \nacknowledge they have helped our economy, which grew at a 4.1-percent \nannual rate in the third quarter of last year, the 10th straight \nquarter in which gross domestic production grew at a rate above 3 \npercent. It is interesting to compare this with the European economies. \nFor 2005, the Euro area gross domestic production grew at only 1.4 \npercent. Economists predict for 2006 it will be about 1.9 percent. The \nUnited States, by contrast, is expected to grow at 3.6 percent for \n2006, according to the CBO.\n  What does this mean, or how does the gross domestic production \nactually increase? You have to have business investment, primarily \nsmall businesses. Interestingly, business investment fell in the nine \nconsecutive quarters before the 2003 tax rate bill was passed. For nine \nconsecutive quarters, businesses were not investing. Investment was \ndeclining. So in 2003 we passed these additional tax rates. What \nhappened was cutting taxes on capital helped reverse the decline. In \nthe 11 consecutive quarters since these tax cuts, business investment \nmeasured by nonresidential fixed investment has increased each and \nevery quarter. In fact, business investment has continued to increase \neven after the expiration of the temporary bonus depreciation for \nbusiness investments expire.\n  Interestingly, it has not just been businesses that have seen \nadditional revenue as a result of the investment, but there has been \njob creation from these tax cuts. But, ironically, these tax cuts--or \nparadoxically, I could say--have also provided increased revenues to \nthe Federal Treasury. According to a recent report by the CBO, capital \ngains revenue is 16 times greater than it was forecast to be. \nGovernment estimators predicted that the reduction in capital gains \nrates enacted in 2003 would cost the Federal Government $27 billion in \nlost revenues for 2004. CBO's most recent report shows\n\n[[Page S1103]]\n\nthat the lower rates actually brought in an additional $26 billion in \nrevenue. Instead of costing $27 billion, the lower rates actually made \n$26 billion for the Treasury.\n\n  Why does that happen? It is fairly obvious. You are holding assets, \nand if you sell them, it will cost you 20 percent in taxes, 20 percent \nof the gain. That is a pretty stiff tax. You do not want to do that. \nCongress comes along and says: We will reduce that down to 15 percent. \nSmall businesses, in particular, say: Great; in that event, we will pay \nless in taxes, 25 percent less. We will go ahead and sell the asset and \nonly pay 15 percent.\n  So more people do that than were expected to sell assets so even at a \nlower rate, because of the increase in volume, the Government ends up \nmaking a lot more money.\n  Think of it this way. You are a department store. When you go to the \ndepartment store and there is a big sale over the week, how can the \ndepartment store make any money? It is simple. They reduce the price \nthey sell their product for, but there is so much more of the product \nsold that they more than make up for the reduced cost by the volume of \nsales.\n  It is the same thing that occurs here. Lower the rate a little bit, \nbut that attracts people to sell their assets, to take advantage of \nthat lower rate. And that increased volume in sales more than makes up \nfor the reduction in the rate. That is why you have to be a little \ncareful with the CBO projections about the ``cost'' to the Federal \nGovernment of lower taxes. Frequently, the cost ends up not to be a \ncost at all but an increase in actual revenues. That is precisely what \nhas been occurring here.\n  It is interesting that according to the same CBO report, the \nGovernment took in $60 billion in capital gains taxes in fiscal year \n2004, which is a 20-percent increase from 2003. And it is projected \nthat capital gains taxes coming into the Treasury increased another 25 \npercent in 2005--up $75 billion. That is real money no matter how you \ncalculate it.\n  We cannot say for certain that the lower tax rates will always \ncontinue to make revenue for the Treasury in the future, but looking \nback we can sure conclude that these investment tax rates have thus far \nbeen nothing but good news for the Treasury. That means good news for \nall of us because instead of the Government going further into a \ndeficit situation, this increased revenue is helping us to keep the \ndeficit more under control.\n  It is interesting that overall revenues are up in 2005. The Treasury \ncollected $2.15 trillion in revenues, which is the highest level of \nFederal receipts in history, and it is $274 billion more than collected \nin the previous year. Remember, this is with lower tax rates. Yet we \nstill took in $274 billion more than collected the year before. That is \na 14.6-percent increase overall. CBO has projected individual revenues \nfor 2006 will be up 8.2 percent, greater than they were from 2005, and \nthat corporate receipts will be 8.6 percent higher. Revenues for \nDecember 2005, just to take that month, were 12 percent higher than \nthey were for December 2004. Corporate receipts were up about 33 \npercent, and receipts from individual income tax payments were up about \n5 percent.\n  This is the biggest reason we should not in any sense be accepting \narguments that somehow we need to have what some people around here \ncall pay-go, where you take the CBO estimates of how much a tax \nreduction is going to cost the Treasury, and somehow you make that up \nin additional revenue. So that net, you are not reducing taxes on the \ntaxpayers at all.\n  What is the point of a tax reduction if it is not a real tax \nreduction; if you are just taking money out of one pocket but then you \nhave to add it from the other pocket? It makes no sense. In fact, it is \njust reversed. We should not be talking about the cost to the Treasury; \nwe should be talking about the cost to the taxpayers. They are the ones \nwho have to pay. It is their hard-earned money. We cannot spend a dime \nin Congress that somebody did not work very hard to earn to send back \nto Washington in the form of taxes.\n  When we talk about increasing taxes or decreasing taxes or keeping \nthe level of the taxes where they are right now, and we calculate the \ncost to the Federal Treasury, I say forget that. I am worried about the \ncost on my constituents. They are the ones who will invest. They are \nthe ones who will hire more people if we let them keep more money. And \nthat means more people will have jobs. If people have jobs, they will \npay more in taxes and the Government will continue to collect more \nrevenue.\n  The statistics I have quoted demonstrate that a sensible tax policy, \none which doesn't set the rates too high, will actually end up bringing \nmore revenue into the Federal Treasury than one which tries to set the \nrates too high. That is why since pay-go does nothing about the \nspending side of the equation, which is what is driving up the \ndeficit--because our big entitlement programs: Medicare, Medicaid, and \nSocial Security are not affected by that. It does nothing to affect \nthem whatsoever. The only thing it does is require if we have a tax \nreduction we have to have a tax increase somewhere else so it comes out \neven. That does not do the economy any good at all.\n  The bottom line is the provisions of the bill before the Senate, as \nwell as those that are likely to come back to the Senate from \nconference, will be helpful to individual taxpayers in the lower income \nbrackets and helpful to families who create small businesses, who have \nsmall businesses that create jobs. They will be helpful to the economy \nas a whole and even helpful to the Federal Treasury.\n  I will refer a little bit to this argument made by some, including my \ngood friend from Montana, that we cannot afford to do both the 1-year \nfix for AMT; that is to say, have most people not pay the unanticipated \ntaxes under the alternative minimum tax, and also the relief we would \nprovide by continuing the existing tax rates for capital gains and \ndividends. The fact of the matter is, we can, and we will, do both. \nWithin the next 3 or 4 weeks, we will have done both, and the country \nwill be better off for it.\n\n  There is about $30 billion that is required to provide the so-called \nfix for the alternative minimum tax to make sure that at least most \ntaxpayers are not going to be stunned by that tax this year. I support \nthat. The AMT is a feature of our Tax Code that has gone awry. As I \nsaid, both Senator Baucus and I have sponsored legislation to do away \nwith it. Its intended purpose was to make sure very wealthy people \ncould not zero out their tax liability by claiming what are, in fact, \nlegitimate deductions and exemptions and credits. But they were being \nused to the point that some people paid virtually no taxes or no taxes. \nCongress decided: Well, everybody has to pay something, everybody \nexcept people at the low income.\n  But because it was not indexed for inflation, and, as it turns out, \nit is almost impossible to target just the ``rich,'' the AMT has gone \nawry. It has crept into the middle class. If we do not stop it, before \nlong it is going to affect virtually all taxpayers.\n  So what the bill provides is an increased exemption for 2006 so that \nthe exemptions do not drop back to pre-2001 levels. It also prevents \ncertain credits from being eroded by the AMT. The net result is that \nmost people should not have to worry about the AMT tax bill for this \nyear.\n  But the bottom line is, we can do that and also provide the relief \nfor capital gains and dividends, according to the calculation of the \n``costs'' for that relief. In other words, extending for 2 more years \nthe existing rates for capital gains and dividends, that is a little \nmore than $20 billion.\n  So when Congress passed the $70 billion in relief in the budget last \nApril, and asked the committees to come back with their reconciliation \nin taxes for that amount, we wanted to make sure no one would pay \nhigher taxes during this 5-year budget window. We can do that by \nextending the same rate for capital gains and dividends--that is about \n$20 billion--providing this year of relief from the alternative minimum \ntax--that is about $30 billion--and there is still something like $16 \nbillion or $20 billion, about $20 billion left over for other \nprovisions which we also want to take care of.\n  I am also going to discuss some of these other provisions because I \nthink it is very important for anybody who might think about voting \nagainst this bill to appreciate what they would be voting against.\n  First, they would be voting against the savers' credit. The savers' \ncredit is\n\n[[Page S1104]]\n\na nonrefundable tax credit that encourages low-income taxpayers to make \ncontributions to an employer-provided retirement savings plan or an \nIRA. This tax reconciliation bill extends that credit through 2009. It \nis currently scheduled to expire at the end of this year. Nationwide, \nalmost 5.5 million filers take advantage of this tax credit. By the \nway, almost 100,000 of those filers are in my State of Arizona.\n  How about small business expensing? Under current law, small \nbusinesses can deduct the cost of qualified investments in the first \nyear they are made, up to $100,000, indexed for inflation. After 2007, \nthis amount will drop back to $25,000. What our bill does is to extend \nthe increased amount through 2009. Keeping the increased amount enables \nsmall businesses to continue to invest and grow.\n  Now, if you vote against this bill, here is something else you will \nbe voting against: the above-the-line deduction for college tuition \nexpenses. Under current law, the provision that allows a taxpayer to \ntake an above-the-line deduction for college tuition costs expired at \nthe end of 2005. It is done. The full deduction is available for joint \nfilers with income under $130,000 and is phased down for higher income \nfilers.\n  The tax reconciliation bill, the bill that is before us, would extend \nit through 2009. We have to do that this year because it has expired. \nAbove-the-line deductions are important in this case because they are \navailable to nonitemizers, while most deductions, below the line, are \nonly available to those filers who itemize. Nationwide, over 3.6 \nmillion filers claimed this deduction in 2004. About 74,000 of those \nfilers, by the way, were in my State of Arizona.\n  There are some other extenders. The President talked about some of \nthese in his State of the Union speech. For example, the R tax credit \nthat is so important to continued research and development in our \ncountry. And there is the 15-year depreciation recovery period for \nrestaurant improvements, the 15-year depreciation recovery period for \nleasehold improvements. This bill also extends the deduction for \nteachers who pay for some expenses out of their own pocket. This is \nsomething I introduced some years ago. In fact, if my recollection \nserves, the average teacher spends about $500 a year out of her or his \nown pocket to bring supplies to school that are not paid for by the \nschools in order help teach the kids. We provide a deduction for that. \nNationwide, there are 3.3 million filers who take advantage of that. \nAnd 62,000 of those are in my State of Arizona.\n  Finally, to mention the sales tax deduction. This is very important. \nIt is not important in my State in particular, but it sure is important \nin some other States. For 2004 and 2005, taxpayers living in States \nwithout income taxes could take an itemized deduction for State and \nlocal sales taxes in lieu of the existing deduction for State and local \nincome taxes, from which they get no benefit. The reconciliation bill \nwould extend this option for 2006. Nationwide, 12.3 million families \nand individuals will benefit from the sales tax deduction this year, \n2006.\n  So the bottom line of all of this is that this bill is not just about \nthe AMT and capital gains and dividends; it is about a lot more. My \ncolleagues who want to help average taxpayers, people who do not even \nitemize their deductions, teachers, small businesses--all of these \ntaxpayers are benefited by the bill we have before us. It is important \nfor us to support these taxpayers, by the millions, as I said.\n  There is a final point; that is, a point that Senator Baucus has \nraised concerning the so-called Byrd rule. This is a very technical, \nrather arcane point about revenue loss beyond the budget window. The \ntwo tax-writing committee chairmen in the House and the Senate are well \naware of this requirement and will make certain the conference \nagreement complies with all rules of the Senate by including any \nnecessary offsets, as the Senate-passed reconciliation bill complies \nwith all rules of the Senate. So I want to assure my colleagues that \nthe problem that has been raised is not going to be a problem by the \ntime we conclude voting on this legislation. They can rest assured of \nthat.\n  So, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues, as they consider any motions \nto instruct conferees this evening, that it is all well and good to \ntell our conferees what we think, but the bottom line is, we need to \nget this bill into conference so the conference committee can issue a \nconference report that we will then deal with and our House colleagues \nwill then deal with, that will continue the tax rates that currently \nexist, that will continue the deductions and exemptions we currently \nhave for all these taxpayers we talk about, that will not allow taxes \nto increase on our constituents. That is what this bill is all about--\nnothing more, nothing less--no tax increases.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n          TABLE 3.6.--2003, INDIVIDUAL

The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the next motion will be a motion by the \nSenator from Oregon, Mr. Wyden, on energy. I ask unanimous consent that \nthe pending motions be temporarily laid aside so the Senator from \nOregon may offer his motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                      Motion To Instruct Conferees\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I send a motion to the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Mr. Wyden moves that the managers on the part of the Senate \n     at the conference on the disagreeing votes of the 2 Houses on \n     the Senate amendment to the bill H.R. 4297 (to provide for \n     reconciliation pursuant to the concurrent resolution on the \n     budget for fiscal year 2006 (H. Con. Res. 95)) be instructed \n     to insist on a provision that repeals accelerated \n     depreciation for geologic and geophysical costs for oil and \n     gas exploration by the 5 major oil companies for the \n     following reasons:\n       (1) In April 2005, President Bush stated that ``With $55 \n     oil, we don't need incentives for oil and gas companies to \n     explore.''. On February 10, 2006, oil futures trading on the \n     New York Mercantile Exchange closed at $61.84 per barrel.\n       (2) At a November 9, 2005, joint hearing of the Committee \n     on Energy and Natural Resources and the Committee on \n     Commerce, Science, and Transportation, the Chief Executives \n     of ExxonMobil, ChevronTexaco, ConocoPhillips, BP, and Shell \n     all testified that the new tax breaks in the Energy Policy \n     Act of 2005 were unnecessary for their companies to explore \n     for oil. Accelerated depreciation for geologic and \n     geophysical costs for oil and gas exploration is one of the \n     new tax breaks provided by the Energy Policy Act of 2005.\n       (3) The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that this \n     special interest tax break for major oil companies costs the \n     taxpayers and the United States Treasury more than \n     $100,000,000 over the next 5 years and almost $300,000,000 \n     over 10 years. The United States taxpayers will have to pay \n     higher taxes to provide this tax break for big oil companies.\n       (4) In 2005, the 5 major oil companies whose Chief \n     Executives testified before the joint hearing of the \n     Committee on Energy and Natural Resources and the Committee \n     on Commerce, Science, and Transportation reported net profits \n     of more than $111,000,000,000.\n       (5) At a time of record high oil company profits and high \n     Federal budget deficits, hardworking American taxpayers \n     should not have to provide record subsidies to major oil \n     companies. Congress should eliminate this special interest \n     tax break for the largest oil companies that even these oil \n     companies say is not needed.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I thank, particularly, the distinguished \nSenator from Montana, who is on the floor, Mr. Baucus, and Senator \nGrassley, for working very closely with me on this issue because I \nthink this illustrates something the Senate is going to have to tackle \naggressively in the days ahead. This, at least, makes a modest step in \nthe right direction.\n  At a time when the oil companies have been making record profits and \noften charging record prices at the pump, it does not seem, to me, they \nought to be receiving record subsidies from the taxpayers.\n  What this amendment does--and this would mean for the first time in, \nas far as I can tell, 20 years--the Congress would actually be rolling \nback a subsidy to the oil industry. This would limit one of the new tax \nbreaks that the major oil companies received in last year's Energy \nbill.\n  The reason I feel so strongly about this, colleagues, is we had the \nmajor oil companies before the Energy Committee recently, and I asked \nthe CEOs of the five largest oil companies if they agreed with the \nPresident's statement--and I quote here--``With $55 oil, we don't need \nincentives for oil and gas companies to explore.''\n  The CEOs of ExxonMobil, ChevronTexaco, ConocoPhillips, BP, and Shell \nall agreed that the new tax breaks for exploration in the Energy bill \nwere unnecessary. In fact, ExxonMobil CEO Lee Raymond said:\n\n       When you add it all up that energy legislation is zero in \n     terms of how it affects ExxonMobil.\n\n  So what we have is the bizarre situation where the Congress sends \nbillions of dollars of new subsidies to the oil companies when the oil \ncompanies actually show up at congressional hearings and say they do \nnot even need these subsidies that the Congress is sending them.\n  Now, ExxonMobil recently announced it had posted an all-time record \nprofit of $36 billion in 2005. That huge amount is not just the highest \nprofit ever for an oil company, it is the highest profit ever for any \ncompany. And ExxonMobil is not the only oil company to post a record-\nhigh profit in 2005. ConocoPhillips reported its profits shot up 66 \npercent to $13.5 billion, while ChevronTexaco's profits jumped to more \nthan $14 billion. The five largest oil companies in the country had \ncombined profits of more than $110 billion.\n  So I would only say to the Senate today, it is one thing to talk \nabout new tax breaks to the oil companies and to look at them, as we \nare doing today, and to particularly say: Do the oil companies need \nthese tax breaks in order to promote exploration and secure the energy \nour country needs? What we now have is the situation where the oil \ncompanies themselves have come to the Congress and have said, publicly, \nbefore the Congress, they do not need these kinds of tax breaks.\n  At a time when they make record profits and consumers have recently \npaid record-high prices, the Federal Government simply should not \nrecord record-high subsidies to these companies.\n  The Senate tax reconciliation bill includes an amendment I had the \nopportunity to work with Chairman Grassley and Senator Baucus on to \neliminate one of the new tax breaks for the oil companies to explore. \nThis is exactly the type of incentive the major oil company CEOs and \nPresident Bush have said they do not need.\n  The special-interest tax break I was able to see eliminated from the \nFinance Committee bill would cost taxpayers about $300 million over 10 \nyears. The taxpayers, in effect, would have to pay higher taxes to \nprovide this big break for major oil companies, when the price of oil \nis over $60 per barrel. That is $7 per barrel higher than the price at \nwhich the President said they\n\n[[Page S1106]]\n\ndo not need incentives. At these high prices, it is my view we ought to \ntake back this unnecessary tax break and save our citizens hard-earned \ntax dollars.\n  Now, there are some in the industry who may argue the five major oil \ncompanies' CEOs do not speak for the entire industry. They may argue \nthe small producers still need more incentives to explore.\n  I want to emphasize this amendment does not affect the small \nproducers. This amendment is about the large oil companies, the people \nwho came to the Senate and said they do not need new subsidies.\n  This amendment is about making sure these major firms don't get a tax \nbreak they now have testified they don't need. The fact is, over the \npast 2 years, oil companies have already increased their drilling \noperations as the price of oil has skyrocketed from $45 per barrel to \nover $70 per barrel. The number of rigs in operation and the amount of \ndrilling have also been increased by a third since 2003. Most of this \nincreased drilling occurred before the new tax break went into effect.\n  What it comes down to is Congress should not provide more subsidies \nto major oil companies that make record profits to do what they are \nalready doing, especially at a time when our consumers are getting \nhammered at the pump. Unless the Congress accepts this measure that the \nFinance Committee accepted when I offered it through the support of the \nchairman and Senator Baucus, the major oil companies would be getting a \nsignificant new tax break that other major industries don't get.\n  Instead of having to write off some of their capital costs over a \nnumber of years, major companies would get accelerated writeoffs for \nwhat is called geological and geophysical exploration costs. According \nto the Joint Committee on Taxation, the IRS and the Federal courts have \nruled that these costs are capital costs which should properly be \ndepreciated over the entire period the oil well is producing, which can \nbe a decade or longer.\n  The President's budget calls for scaling back this special treatment \nof oil and gas exploration costs by extending the depreciation period \nfor what are called G costs from 2 to 5 years. The Senate bill takes \na little different approach by repealing accelerated depreciation of \nthese costs for the biggest oil companies.\n  I wish to emphasize this, particularly since I see my friend from \nMississippi who has discussed the energy issue in a very thoughtful way \nin committee. The Senator from Mississippi and others have stressed how \nimportant these incentives are to the independents and small producers. \nThis is something with which I am sympathetic.\n  I have indicated to Chairman Grassley and others that I believe we \nought to be taking a comprehensive look at the Tax Code as it relates \nto the energy field to make sure we can reconfigure these tax breaks so \nthat when they are needed by the small companies and the independents, \nthey can get them, but we don't keep sending them out the door to the \nbig oil companies and then have these big oil companies in effect \nembarrass the Congress by coming to a hearing and saying: Look, we \ndon't need these breaks.\n  Tax breaks such as the accelerated writeoffs for these costs also \nclutter up the Tax Code and distort capital markets. It is not the \nplace to discuss it today, but my Fair Flat Tax Act would give us a \nbipartisan opportunity to remove some of that clutter from the Tax \nCode. At least we can make a start at reform today by eliminating the \nspecial interest tax break for the oil industry which the companies say \nthey don't need.\n  Our consumers already pay more at work, they pay more at home, and \nthey pay more as they drive everywhere in between. Let's give them a \nbreak in their personal energy bills. We can give them a break by \nensuring that those folks who are getting hammered with high energy \nbills at home won't have to subsidize profitable oil companies when \nthey pay their taxes.\n  I urge my colleagues to support fiscal responsibility by supporting \nmy motion to urge the conferees to support the Senate position, \neliminate this special tax break for the major companies. This does not \napply to the small companies. It doesn't apply to the independents. I \nhave worked closely with Chairman Grassley and Senator Baucus to ensure \nthat will be the case.\n  I hope we will be back in this Chamber for a more comprehensive \ndiscussion of the Tax Code and energy policy in the days ahead. My own \nsense is, in the last energy bill, we subsidized an awful lot of people \nto do the wrong thing. Getting a new energy policy is arguably the most \nred, white, and blue issue the Congress could possibly take up. I think \nabout our soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan, these individuals who honor \nus every day with their courage and valor. I want to make sure their \nkids and grandkids are not off in the Middle East fighting a war and \nCongress is still dallying on oil.\n  This is a step in the right direction. I suspect other colleagues \nwant to discuss this issue. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  In fact, how much additional time do I have on this motion?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 18\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, will the Senator from Oregon yield for a \ncouple questions?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Absolutely.\n  Mr. LOTT. I wanted to make sure I understood what the Senator was \nadvocating.\n  Is the Senator proposing a motion to instruct that would basically \nsay that the Senate should insist on the position it had in our version \nof this reconciliation tax package in conference?\n  Mr. WYDEN. The Senator is correct. I am asking that we insist on what \nwe did in the Finance Committee and what Chairman Grassley and Senator \nBaucus have worked closely with me on. It is our feeling that we do \nneed to have a broader and more comprehensive discussion about this \ndown the road, but we took a modest step in the right direction in the \nFinance Committee. That is what I wish to preserve with this motion.\n  Mr. LOTT. And that language was retained in the full Senate?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Right.\n  Mr. LOTT. Let me just say to the Senator from Oregon that regardless \nof whether Senators agree or disagree, this is an appropriate motion to \ninstruct. This relates to the bill at hand. Obviously, it is not going \nto buy any conferees. I hope I will be a conferee. Certainly, it won't \nbuy me. But at least it speaks to the substance of the bill before us. \nThe Senator has his right to do this, and it certainly is appropriate.\n  Most of these other motions to instruct we are going to be dealing \nwith don't really deal with the bill; they are purely partisan hit \namendments or motions to instruct. And what we are going to do on this \nside is respond in kind. It is the kind of partisan political \n``gotcha'' which has caused this institution to deteriorate to the \nnadir where we are. It is unfortunate, and I am sad about it. But if \nthat is the way we are going to proceed, I am going to join in the fun \nand games before the day is done.\n  At least in the case of the Senator from Oregon, he is dealing with a \nsubject in the bill. I commend him for that. He is very thoughtful in \nthis, as in most subjects. His motion to instruct is an appropriate \none.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, to respond briefly, I thank the Senator \nfrom Mississippi. I am interested in working with him on the Finance \nCommittee. This discussion does need to be part of a longer debate.\n  The Senator from Mississippi has drawn an important distinction that \na number of us have talked about as to the difference between the small \nfirms and the independents and the big firms. What we tried to do in \nthis bipartisan amendment is to preserve it. Frankly, in a sense, we \nought to do this just to prevent the embarrassment of the Senate. When \nyou have these big oil companies show up in broad daylight and say they \ndon't need these tax breaks, and the Congress has just been sending out \nbillions of dollars, that ought to be a wake-up call for both sides of \nthe aisle, Democrats and Republicans, to work together to rethink this. \nI hope this will be the beginning of such an effort. It is a modest \nstep. It will save $300 million over 10 years--clearly, not what we \nneed to do to deal with the hemorrhaging of the Federal budget, but at \nleast it is a step in the right direction.\n\n[[Page S1107]]\n\n  I thank the distinguished Senator from Mississippi and reserve the \nremainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: Are we now on the \nconference report itself so that I could yield myself time off the \noverall report?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time can be yielded from the general \ndebate.\n  Mr. LOTT. I ask unanimous consent that I be yielded time off of the \ndebate which is scheduled on our side of the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I will be brief. In line with what I was \njust saying, I have been informed by the staff that the Parliamentarian \nprobably would consider motions to instruct conferees regarding making \npermanent the changes we have provided in the alternative minimum tax \narea. If that would be in order, if we start down this trail of motions \nto instruct, I would be prepared to offer one in this AMT area or defer \nto the chairman, if he would prefer to do so.\n  This is an area in which we should act. I remember a few years ago \nwhen we got into the discussion of the alternative minimum tax, the \ndesired goal was to make sure that everybody paid some minimum amount \nof taxes. It was aimed at the wealthy. But as we all have learned, \nbecause of the way the Tax Code works, more and more middle-income \nAmericans have been pulled into this AMT web. It has gotten to be a \nserious problem, so we have proposed to do something in the Senate-\npassed bill on a temporary basis on the AMT.\n  My proposal would be, if it is the right thing to do, make it \npermanent. This is the kind of thing we are playing around with that is \ninappropriate. Why would we do it for a year or two? If it is the right \nthing to do, let's make it permanent.\n  I suspect there are some people in the Senate who will not want to do \nthat for whatever reason. My question is: Why not, if it is the right \nthing to do? The same thing is true with some of the other proposals \nwhich have been considered. If we are going to extend the tax break for \nsome of these families with children so they won't get hit with a tax \nincrease, shouldn't we do it here? Who now wants to stand up and defend \nthe fairness of what is happening with this alternative minimum tax, \nwhat it is doing to middle-income workers?\n  With all the complaints we hear about the AMT on both sides of the \naisle, why in the world wouldn't we support a motion to instruct to \nmake it permanent? I would hope that we would. I think that \nsubstantively, this is a no-brainer. Yet I understand there is \nresistance to doing that. Maybe there are some people who don't want to \nvote on that motion to instruct.\n  There are 20 million American families affected by this pernicious \nprovision in the Tax Code which has taken on aspects we never intended. \nIf it is the right thing to do, then the budget should reflect that. \nThis tax reconciliation should reflect that. We ought to make the \nchange in the AMT permanent.\n  I would hope that we wouldn't get into a long list of motions to \ninstruct. They are irrelevant anyway. But both sides need to know that \nif we are going to start down that trail, there are going to be some \nuncomfortable motions to instruct on both sides, and we are going to \nget a chance to vote on making the changes in the unfairness of the \nalternative minimum tax that affects all these millions of families \npermanent.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Observing no other Senator wishing to speak, I suggest the absence of \na quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I think around 8 we will probably have two \nvotes. It is also my understanding that the other side of the aisle \nwill be offering various motions to instruct which presumably will be \nvoted on, as will motions to instruct on this side of the aisle.\n  I must say, though, I have glanced at the proposed motions to \ninstruct on the other side, and I find it very curious. Why do I say \nthat? I say that because we in the Senate passed a bill. The House has \npassed a bill.\n  We are going to go to conference on the two bills now. Presumably, it \nis the Senate conferees who are charged to defend the Senate bill. \nPresumably, the House conferees are charged to defend the House bill. \nAfter all, that is what a conference is all about. The Senate passes a \nbill and goes to conference; the House passes a bill and goes to \nconference.\n  These motions that are going to be offered, however, do not defend \nthe Senate bill. Quite to the contrary, they are opposed to the Senate \nbill. They defend the House-passed bill, the capital gains treatment. I \nfind that very curious. I, frankly, find it very disconcerting, because \nif this is the case, it will set the precedent basically for a motion \nto instruct, not to defend the body's views. Most of the motions to \ninstruct from the other side will be motions not to defend the Senate \nbill, but urge provisions in the House bill. That is nuts.\n  Most of the motions to instruct by Members on this side are asking \nthe conferees to defend the Senate-passed provisions. I point that out \nbecause, as I said, it is curious and disconcerting, and I hope all \nMembers recognize what is going on here; namely, what I just outlined. \nI hope this is an aberration and that it doesn't continue. Otherwise, \nthis is another example of the chaos, the virtual free-for-all around \nhere, and disrespect for procedure, for rules, for civility, and for \nboth sides working together. I hope maybe that is an oversight by the \nother side of the aisle with all the motions that are going to be \ncoming up.\n  Nevertheless, I have them before me. That is what they seem to say. I \npoint that out for Members; it is an observation before we vote to take \ninto consideration. Most of the instructions I see are with respect to \ncapital gains treatment. There is no provision for extending current \nlaw which doesn't expire until January 1, 2009; whereas, there are \nprovisions in the House-passed bill to extend it for 2 more years, even \nthough current law doesn't expire until January 1, 2009.\n  The motions to be offered are to basically take up and encourage the \nconferees to pass the House provisions. That is very curious.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I see the Senator from Illinois, and I ask \nunanimous consent that the pending motions be temporarily set aside so \nthat the Senator from Illinois may offer a motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Motion to Instruct Conferees\n\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Montana for the \nexcellent work he has been doing.\n  I send a motion to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n       Mr. Obama moves that the managers on the part of the Senate \n     at the conference on the disagreeing votes of the 2 Houses on \n     the Senate amendment to the bill H.R. 4297 (to provide for \n     reconciliation pursuant to the concurrent resolution on the \n     budget for fiscal year 2006 (H. Con. Res. 95)) be instructed \n     to insist that any final conference report shall provide tax \n     relief for the most vulnerable members of our society, \n     including the low-income victims of Hurricane Katrina and \n     children in families that are too poor to benefit fully from \n     the refundable child tax credit.\n\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, 2 weeks ago, in a debate on the Senate \nversion of the tax reconciliation bill, I proposed an amendment to \nprovide tax relief for victims of Katrina, paid for by restricting the \nextension of capital gains and dividend tax cuts only to people with \nincomes under $100 million. My amendment would have made all children \nof working parents in the disaster area eligible for at least a partial \ncredit.\n\n[[Page S1108]]\n\n  For the convenience of my colleagues, I agreed not to demand a vote \non that amendment. But I rise again to urge my colleagues not to forget \nKatrina and her victims who continue to struggle. In a bill with $70 \nbillion of tax cuts, surely we can find $274 million to do something \nfor the most vulnerable members of our society.\n  In the weeks after Katrina made landfall, President Bush vowed to do \nwhat it takes to help the region recover. We wanted to believe him. We \nhad witnessed the devastation caused by the hurricane, and we saw the \nterror of poor families with their lives turned upside down, homes \ndestroyed, jobs and businesses lost, families separated, and lives \npermanently changed.\n  At the time, the President said:\n\n       We have a duty to confront this poverty with bold action.\n\n  Almost 6 months later, the Government's actions have not matched the \nPresident's rhetoric. Evacuees are getting kicked out of their hotel \nrooms this week because FEMA stopped paying the bill. Thousands of \ntemporary mobile homes ordered by FEMA are sitting empty in nearby \nSouthern States. The Federal response continues to be inadequate to get \nthe families back on their feet.\n  We can do better for these families. At a time when we are debating \n$70 billion of tax cuts, most of which will benefit corporations and \npeople who need help the least, why not set aside a small fraction to \nhelp those who need it most?\n  One way to help those who need help the most is to enhance the \nrefundable portion of the child tax credit. Under current law, families \nwho earn less than $11,000 get no benefit from the refundable child \ncredit. That means that a child does not get any benefit from the \ncredit even if her parents work full time at the minimum wage. And the \nchild doesn't get the full benefit of the $1,000 credit until her \nparents earn close to $18,000, or even more if the child has siblings. \nAs a result, almost 17 million children get less than the full credit. \nWouldn't it make sense to recognize the damage wrought by the hurricane \nand to eliminate the income threshold that excludes the poorest of \nchildren from getting the credit? Wouldn't it make sense to say to the \nchildren affected by Katrina that they will no longer be denied at \nleast a partial credit so long as their parents are working?\n  The cost of this fix is estimated at $274 million over 2 years. To \nget a sense of perspective, that is less than one-half of 1 percent of \nthe cost of this entire bill. It is a matter of common sense and \nfairness--the least we can do when we are cutting taxes for wealthy \nAmericans. If we do this, hundreds of thousands of this country's most \ndisadvantaged children will see an increase in their credit--not as a \nhandout but because their parents work.\n  I hope we don't forget the images we witnessed in the aftermath of \nthe hurricane--the people, their suffering, and the devastation. We \nshouldn't forget the daily struggles families right now are going \nthrough trying to rebuild their lives. Let us not forget our \nGovernment's promise to do what it takes for families along the gulf \ncoast. Let us not forget our duty, as the President put it, to confront \npoverty with bold action.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in instructing the Senate managers to \nprovide tax relief for the most vulnerable members of our society. \nTogether, let us urge them to remember the low-income victims of \nKatrina and the children and families too poor to benefit fully from \nthe refundable child credit. Obviously, this is a modest piece of \nlegislation. It is a motion to instruct. My suspicion is that even if \nit passed, other priorities would move to the fore.\n  Let me say in closing that it is shameful, what is happening in the \ngulf coast right now. I think all of us recognize the scope of the \ndevastation. All of us were embarrassed at the slow response \nimmediately after the hurricane. It has now been 6 months. We have not \nshown the sense of urgency that the American people did privately after \nthe hurricane. I would hope that at least we can send some small signal \nthat we are concerned about the kids who are languishing, who have been \nuprooted, who aren't in the schools they were attending and in the \nneighborhoods in which they grew up.\n  This is one way to send that signal, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport my motion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I strongly support extending the deduction \nfor tuition costs through December 31, 2009, as provided for in the \nSenate bill.\n  To compete successfully in the world today, America must make \neducation a priority--not only a priority but a very top priority. Why? \nI think it is pretty obvious. For one thing, our competitors certainly \nare.\n  Let's talk about, for example, training engineers. Engineers develop \nnew jobs and new industries. Yet Japan and Europe train twice as many \nengineers as we do. China trains three times as many. In fact, I think \nthe statistics are even more alarming than that. We are missing the \nboat. We are missing the boat.\n  Let's just stop for a minute. If China, Europe, and Japan train many \nmore times than we, especially China, and add Indians to the mix--\nIndians are training lots of engineers--just think of what that means \nfor the next 5 or 10 years based only on the size of those countries. \nIf they are training many times more than we--and I think the \npopulation of India is close to 1 billion, and China is 1.3 billion. In \nabout 10 years, it is going to be somewhat more than 1 billion. And our \npopulation is about 280 million, 290 million, something like that. I \nwould say we are way behind the eight ball. We need to spend much more \ntime than we are on education.\n  Congress has responded with a number of income tax benefits for \nhigher education financing. Tax incentives such as the HOPE scholarship \nand lifetime learning credits, the Coverdell education savings account \nand prepaid tuition and college savings plans help American families \npay for college. The deduction for qualified higher education tuition \nand related expenses, section 222 of the Tax Code, was first added as \npart of the 2001 Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act.\n\n  Let me explain more. We cannot allow America's workforce to be left \nbehind. To remain the most competitive and innovative country in the \nworld, we need to make education affordable.\n  Let me state a small anecdote. I was in Bangalore, India, not too \nlong ago, about 3 or 4 weeks ago, and I asked the head of the research \ncenter there, the Jack Welch Research Center, which, frankly, is one of \nthe two or three state-of-the-art research centers General Electric \nhas, I asked the manager of it: Why are you here? Why are you here in \nBangalore? Guess what he said.\n  He said: Because this is where the greatest talent pool is.\n  I asked: Where is the next greatest talent pool for your top-flight \nscientists and engineers here?\n  He said: China.\n  I asked: Well, where is the United States in terms of ranking for the \nbest talent pool?\n  Frankly, he said it was way down on the bottom. Not the very bottom. \nHe said: You are down there.\n  So I asked him: What can we do in America to be more competitive than \nwe are today, to make sure we have the best jobs for our kids, and, \nmore importantly, for our kids and grandkids so that we in America can \npass on to our kids and grandkids the same standard of living we have \ntoday, which our parents gave to us?\n  His answer: You guys have to spend more on education, and you have to \nmake it less expensive so more students can get the quality education \nthey want and need. Also, you have to lower your education costs. It is \ntoo costly in America to get a good education. He said: You also have \nto lower your health care costs. Your health care costs are way, way \ntoo high compared to every other country in the world.\n  Sure, we have high-quality health care, he said, but we spend twice \nas much per capita on health care in America as does the next most \nexpensive country.\n  Are we twice as healthy as the next most expensive country? I doubt \nit.\n  But right off the top, the manager of that technology center in \nBangalore, India, made it very clear to me that we\n\n[[Page S1109]]\n\nAmericans have to spend a lot more time boosting our talent pool so we \nhave more scientists and engineers than we currently have in the United \nStates. We have a lot of them, and they are good, but it is also very \nclear that we are slipping or, to put it differently, other countries \nare catching up and are going to pass us soon if we don't get our act \ntogether.\n  It costs today almost $43,000 a year for tuition, fees, and room and \nboard in a 4-year public college. Just think of it: $43,000 a year; \nthat is a public college. At a 4-year private college, it costs more \nthan $100,000. That is just ridiculous, that it costs that much for a \ncollege education in America today. It is outrageous, and it puts \neducation far out of reach for so many students.\n  From 1981 to 1995, tuition at a 4-year public college/university \nincreased by 234 percent. That is right. From 1981 to 1995, tuition \nincreased by 234 percent. That is three times the growth in median \nhousehold income and more than three times the increase in the cost of \nliving over this same period. That is unsustainable, clearly \nunsustainable. That is wrong. I don't know why this country doesn't \nstart to address that more directly, more frontally, because the \nearlier we do, the more jobs and the more high-paid jobs we are going \nto have for Americans.\n  For tax years 2002 and 2003, taxpayers with adjusted gross incomes of \nless than $65,000--or say $130,000 for married couples filing jointly--\nare allowed to deduct $3,000 for qualified higher education tuition and \nrelated expenses. Three thousand dollars. Remember how costly education \nis, the figures I just gave you a moment earlier.\n  For tax years 2004 and 2005, the maximum deduction is $4,000 for \nthose same families and $2,000 for Americans with adjusted gross \nincomes of $65,000 to $80,000 for a single person or from $130,000 to \n$160,000 for married couples filing jointly. Unfortunately, this \nimportant deduction expired at the end of 2005.\n  Critics of extending the deduction for tuition costs ask why we have \nboth this deduction and the HOPE and lifetime learning tax credits. It \nis true that the current system can be complicated, and it is \ncomplicated. Families that qualify for tax credits are sometimes better \noff with a deduction. Unfortunately, families don't always know which \ntax choice is best for them. So we are looking at whether the tax \nincentives for education should be combined or should they be \nsimplified. But until we do, I wish to put the deduction on the same \ntimetable as the tax credits which are in effect until 2010.\n  Let us look at the House. The House only extends this deduction for 1 \nyear--clearly not enough. Senators on both sides of the aisle have \nagreed that this deduction is important to working families trying to \nget their children a good education. We must, therefore, preserve this \ndeduction and, as proposed in the Senate bill, extend this important \ndeduction for 4 years.\n  If America is going to be competitive in the global economy, it must \nmake education a top priority. Extending the deduction for tuition \ncosts through December 31, 2009, does exactly that by helping provide \nour children with affordable education. Therefore, I will work hard to \nensure the deduction for tuition costs is extended through December 31, \n2009, as provided for in the Senate bill, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this extension.\n  I may sound like a broken record, but every fiber in me, my bones and \nmy muscles, my blood and whatever is in me, I just know that we have to \nwork a lot harder, a lot more effectively to address American \ncompetitiveness, and most of that comes down to education. It is making \nsure that our kids and we ourselves are educated as best as we possibly \ncan. Education is a lifetime effort; it is not just K through 12. It is \nlifetime. It also begins at very early ages--Prestart, Head Start, K \nthrough 12, college. It also includes votech training for job skills. \nIt is continuing education. It is bringing us more up to date. For \nthose of us who graduated a long time ago, it is making sure we are \ncontinuing to be up to date with what is going on and are able to \ntranslate new ideas into jobs.\n\n  I have traveled a lot overseas and I have seen a lot of countries, \nespecially in Asia. I can tell you, they are on the march. Speaking \nprimarily of the Chinese and the Indians--clearly Japan is a very large \ncountry, with the second largest economy in the world, but it will not \nbe long before China is the largest economy in the world. I am guessing \nby the year 2030 China will be the largest economy in the world. That \nis not far away. It is only 24 years from now. I may be off by 10 \nyears; it may be 10 later or 10 earlier. But 24 years is now, in terms \nof the time it takes to get us up to speed, the time it takes to get \neducation programs in place, the time it takes to make sure we are \ngraduating more scientists and engineers and have a tax and health care \npolicy that makes more sense, and an energy policy that makes more \nsense.\n  We are a wonderful, big country. We are extremely lucky. We are the \nluckiest people in the world to be Americans. We don't see people \nheading for the door to live in other countries. Rather, people want to \nlive in America. They want to come to America because of our values, et \ncetera.\n  It is true in the last couple of years our image overseas has been \ngreatly tarnished. The image of America today is not what it was \nseveral years ago. That is due, I think, primarily to the foreign \npolicy of this country. But nevertheless, overall most people would \nrather live in America than some other country. We Americans certainly \nwould. We want that to continue as long as it possibly can, not just \nfor ourselves but, more importantly, for our children and for our \ngrandchildren. That is the legacy we want to pass on to them.\n  To do that, you have to have some kind of plan. You can't let these \ngo helter-skelter. Other countries have plans. They definitely have \nplans. It is clear, China has a plan. I don't know if they are going to \nbe successful, but they have a plan. They know what they want to do. \nThey know that they have to boost and are boosting their science and \nengineering education. They know they have to develop the interior \nprovinces, not just the eastern coastal provinces. What are they doing \nabout it? They are doing something about it. They have a plan. They are \nspending a lot of money and building big superhighways out in western \nChina. There is a big, fancy airport in western China. I was in \nChunking 4 or 5 weeks ago, at a huge, massive, fancy, wonderful airport \nin western China. That is government policy.\n  They have plans to deal with unemployment. They have plans, frankly, \nto put on what they think will be the world's best Summer Olympics in \n2008. I bet they have a plan to win more gold medals than any other \ncountry, too. They have plans. You have to take your hat off to them \nbecause they are doing what they think they have to do to progress and \nbring themselves out from the lower living standards they have had for \nso many years.\n  It is true many Chinese live in poverty. It is true many Indians live \nin poverty. That is also true. But they have plans to address that. I \nremember not too many years ago I was in Shanghai. I was talking to the \nmayor of Shanghai about all these wonderful, fancy buildings in \nShanghai. I said: You must be proud of all you are doing in Shanghai.\n  The mayor turned to me and said: We have problems.\n  I said: What do you mean?\n  We have high unemployment by China's standards. This is what we are \ndoing to retrain people. Some of these jobs are old jobs. As the \nChinese Government works to downsize these state-owned enterprises, \nGovernment-owned enterprises that are all subsidized, they know as they \nenter the World Trade Organization they have to get rid of a lot of \nthese state trading enterprises. Man, oh, man, they know as that \nhappens they are going to have huge unemployment problems. So they have \ndetails, all they are trying to do, in their plan to address that job \nloss in China.\n  Then he pointed to the river there in Shanghai and he said: \nPollution; this river is polluted. We have a 10-year plan to clean up \nthis river so it is no longer polluted.\n  I don't know whether it has been successful or not. That was 5 years \nago. I assume the river is probably polluted. But you could tell, \ntalking to him, he had plans to address the problems that we have.\n  India certainly is the same. When I was in India a couple or 3 weeks \nago,\n\n[[Page S1110]]\n\nthey have plans how they are going to build up India. I went to the \nsubway in Delhi. That is a fancy subway. That makes our subway in \nWashington, DC--it is comparable. But guess what. In the Indian subways \nyou can use your cell phone because they make sure when they tunnel \nunder they have the radio stations there, the towers, so you can use \nyour cell phones. They are building 18 more subways in India, fancy \nones.\n\n  Other countries are building them. It is not us. When I was there, I \nheard constantly from all over India: Where are the Americans? Where \nare you? Australians are here and Malaysians, other countries are here, \nGermans and French. The subway was 60 percent Japanese financed. Where \nare the Americans? They want us there, but we are not there.\n  What I am saying is things are happening in this world. We have to \nget with it. Much of that is education. Much of that is learning what \nis going on. Much of that is forming partnerships where both countries \ndo well. We can't stick our heads in the sand. Things are happening and \nI think a large part of this is education.\n  Let me say this again, about that same point. When Tom Friedman's \nbook came out, ``The World Is Flat,'' I took it on myself to travel \naround the United States by myself and ask CEOs, What do you think of \nthis book? Have you read this book? They all read it, of course.\n  I said: What do you think? Do you agree? They all agreed. Some said: \nThis is scary. Some said: Yes, this is a challenge.\n  Then I asked the next set of questions: What do we do about all this? \nSure, it is true, largely true. Sure, it is a little scary. Sure, it is \na challenge. What do we do about it?\n  That kind of set them back a little bit. They hadn't thought a lot \nabout solutions; a little bit. But the solution they all tended to \ngravitate to was education. We Americans have to focus much more on \nquality education, quality teachers. We are doing a good job. I got a \ngreat education when I grew up in Helena, MT, in Missoula, MT. The \nteachers, I thought, were excellent. They were tough and they were \ngood. Current teachers are good. But all I am saying is whoever we are, \nwe know we have to keep moving and progressing. You know when you tread \nwater you are likely to sink. You can't keep treading water. You have \nto go ahead.\n  I am often reminded of the former head of Intel, Andy Grove, who \nwrote a book, ``Only The Paranoid Survive.'' That is probably true in \nthe semiconductor industry, but I think it is partly true in life. That \nis not to say we all have to be paranoid. Clearly not. But it is to say \nyou have to be vigilant, and really vigilant.\n  Frankly, if I were President, what I would do is change this budget \naround massively. I would put a lot more in this budget for education. \nI would put a lot more into making sure we can solve our health care \ncost problems in this country; more coverage. I would make sure we \ntackled and made America energy independent. This thing about \nindependent 25 years from now is way too tepid, way too weak. We have \nto get started now. I suggest developing DARPA for energy. DARPA, in \nthe Defense Department, developed lots of great technologies, military \ntechnologies, applicable in the private, civilian sector. We can do the \nsame on energy. That will attract bright minds. It will help us be more \nenergy independent, make us less hostage to events overseas.\n  It is so clear to me. I may be wrong, but I tell you it is clear to \nme, anyway, what we need to do. I think in my gut most Americans sense \nthat, this sort of sense we have to get moving here. I think a lot of \nMembers of this body would be surprised, if we were to be much more \nbold, as to the gratitude Americans would show to Congress for finally \ntaking the lead and doing something.\n  We have to get organized somewhat, not seen to be prescriptive, not \nseen to pick winners and losers, but I am saying harness the energy \nthat is in America and help focus it a little more on where we should \nbe going. After all, that is why many of us sought these jobs. We \nsought these jobs to represent our people in the best way we could. We \nsought these jobs because we thought, many of us--most of us think we \nhave pretty good judgment and priorities and common sense. If that is \nthe case, I urge us to get out of our little boxes, get out of our \nlittle cubbyholes, get out of our daily routines, get out of the stuff \nthat pulls us apart from our real job here, just a little bit--maybe \nfor 30 percent of our time--and work more on long-term strategic \nmeasures and do what is right and address the core of some major issues \nthat face us, rather than getting caught up in the routines around \nhere, our series of meetings.\n  Meetings are good. Seeing constituents is great. We serve our \nemployers back home. But we are also here as a body, 100 of us, and I \nthink it is time for us, working with the other body and the executive \nbranch, to truly put partisan politics aside and get something done \nthat makes some sense.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                      Motion to Instruct Conferees\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I share some of my dear colleague's \nfrustrations about how this body runs and I wish we would work better \ntogether. I think it would do a lot of good for our country. I would \nlike to see that happen.\n  I rise today to offer a motion to instruct the conferees to extend \nthe research credit permanently. I understand one of the motions to \ninstruct filed by one of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nsays we should extend the research credit.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I don't want to be too picky here, but \ndon't we have to ask consent to put these motions aside? If that is \nproper, whatever is the routine here, so we have some consistency.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. The Chair was not \nunderstanding that the Senator was offering a motion.\n  Mr. HATCH. I wasn't offering it, but I will be happy to move to put \nit aside when the time comes.\n  I understand one of the motions to instruct, as I was saying, filed \nby one of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, says we should \nextend the research credit for an additional 2 years. In concept, I \ncertainly agree with this idea. The research credit is vital to America \nkeeping its lead in world innovation. But if we are instructing the \nconferees as to better tax policy, why should we stop at a 2-year \nextension? If the research credit is worthy of an extension of an \nadditional 2 years, why is it not worthy of a permanent extension?\n  Along with the distinguished Senator from Montana, Senator Baucus, I \nhave been for many years an advocate of making the research credit \npermanent. As the lead Republican sponsor of legislation to provide for \na permanent research credit, it seems I have come to the floor nearly \nevery year for the past dozen years to either introduce a bill to make \nthe research credit permanent or to offer an amendment to do the same.\n  I might add that Senator Baucus, the distinguished Senator from \nMontana, has been my partner in this matter--or should I say I have \nbeen his partner in this body. We have worked together to try and do \nthis, along with a whole raft of other Senators, usually almost 100 \npercent.\n  In 2001, the Senate overwhelmingly passed an amendment to the \nEconomic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act to make the research \ncredit permanent. Unfortunately, the permanent credit was dropped in \nconference in favor of yet another temporary extension. That amendment \nin 2001, however, was not the only time the Senate voted for a \npermanent extension of the credit. It has happened several times. A \nvery large majority of Senators has voted in favor of a permanent tax \ncredit.\n  My point is that practically every Senator supports the research \ncredit being made permanent. Despite this wide support, permanence has \nnot yet happened. Instead, we keep extending the credit for a year or \ntwo at a time.\n  Why do we do this? The answer is simple. The artificial budget rules \nunder which we operate prevent us from making the credit permanent \nbecause the cost of the permanent extension is determined to be far in \nexcess of the cost of an extension for a year or two.\n\n  Another reason that we extend the research credit for a year or two, \nrather than permanently, is that we all\n\n[[Page S1111]]\n\nseem to be stuck in the mind-set that perpetual temporary extensions \nrepresent de facto permanence. Why worry about making the credit \npermanent when there is little or no doubt about it getting extended \nagain? Doing so represents poor tax policy, but it seems to be the way \nCongress likes to handle this problem.\n  I will never forget the gap that once occurred between the expiration \nof the tax credit and our ability in the Congress to get it restarted.\n  Let's be realistic. We all know that the cost of these temporary \nextensions is no less than the cost of a permanent extension. If we \nthink we are saving revenue to the Treasury by our current practice of \nextending the credit a year or two at a time, we are only fooling \nourselves.\n  However, by not making the credit permanent, we are driving down the \namount companies are willing to spend on innovative research. Even \nthough we all know that the next extension for a year or two is \npractically a sure thing, the private sector does not see it that way. \nThey do not, and can not, plan for the credit on a long-term basis if \nwe only extend it for a temporary period.\n  Thus, we continually engage in a kind of self-defeating behavior--\ntrying to fool ourselves into thinking we are saving taxpayer money by \npassing these temporary extensions while we tell ourselves it does not \nmatter anyway because we are always going to extend the credit again \nfor a year or two when it comes due. All the while, though, companies \nare keeping down their R spending because of the uncertainty provided \nby this practice.\n  Now, we see a Democratic motion to instruct the conferees to insist \non another two years of the research credit, but to be paid for by not \nextending the lower rate on capital gains and dividends, which is in \nthe House bill.\n  That seems not only extreme, it knocks out a very important set of \ntax principles that have kept the economy going. I think we ought to \nhave all of these.\n  Let's face the facts. This motion is nothing more than a weak attempt \nto embarrass Republicans by forcing us to choose between the research \ncredit and the capital gains and dividends provisions.\n  However, it does not work for all the reasons I have indicated. The \nmotion presents us with a false choice. Another temporary extension of \nthe research credit in this body, whether for 1 year or for 2 years, is \npractically a foregone conclusion. Virtually all of us are in favor of \nit. It is going to happen regardless of this motion to instruct.\n  My point, and the point of my own motion to instruct, is to ask, if \nwe really believe the research credit is good policy, why not instruct \nthe conferees to push for a permanent credit? It does not cost any more \nthan a series of temporary extensions.\n  The motion from the other side is not really about the research \ncredit, and everyone knows it. It is about the lower rates for \ndividends and capital gains.\n  I continue to hear claims that Republicans are interested only in \ngiving tax breaks to the rich. This mantra is false and insulting. We \ndo not advocate continuing the lower rates on dividends and capital \ngains because we want to do a favor for the rich.\n  We believe that people respond to incentives, and that higher net \nbenefits of investment leads to more saving. There is ample evidence \nfor this, and this concept is not controversial among economists--they \nmight argue how sensitive saving is to the returns on saving, but no \none disputes that higher returns affects saving.\n  Higher saving leads to more investment by firms, which increases \nproductivity and with it, wages and economic growth. Every worker \nbenefits from an increase in saving. Nobel Laureates Robert Lucas and \nEd Prescott have stated that reducing the tax on investment income is \nthe closest we can come to a free lunch.\n  Some of my colleagues would have the American people believe that by \nsupporting an extension of the lower tax rate on capital gains and \ndividends, Republicans are hurting those with lower incomes. I submit \nthat by increasing saving and investment, we are helping lower income \npeople more than we could in any other way.\n  Besides, if you look at how many people are now invested in the \nmarket, either through pensions or otherwise, or through mutual funds \nor otherwise, a good 50 percent of all taxpayers in America are now in \nthe stock market.\n  Frankly, they all benefit from having these lower rates that we have \nbeen talking about.\n  Incentives lead to more saving. More saving leads to more investment. \nMore investment leads to higher productivity and higher economic \ngrowth. Productivity and economic growth lead to more and better jobs \nfor everyone. It is time for us to stop playing political games and get \nto work helping Americans realize their highest potential. We can start \nby appointing the conferees to the tax bill.\n  That is something that in the past we never had difficulties with, \nbut in the last few years we have.\n  I send this motion to instruct conferees to the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending motion is set \naside.\n  The clerk will report the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Mr. Hatch moves that the managers on the part of the Senate \n     at the conference on the disagreeing votes of the 2 Houses on \n     the Senate amendment to the bill H.R. 4297 (to provide for \n     reconciliation pursuant to the concurrent resolution on the \n     budget for fiscal year 2006 (H. Con. Res. 95)) be instructed \n     to insist on the inclusion in the final conference report of \n     a permanent extension of the credit for increasing research \n     activities (based on section 108 of the amendment passed by \n     the Senate), in order to improve American competitiveness.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I understand that will be placed in the \nproper order and to be considered in the next few days.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator should know that it is now \npending.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I first commend my friend and colleague \nfrom Utah. I agree with him. I think it should be permanent. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the motion to instruct making it permanent. We \nwill have a little more certainty and help in research and development \nin our country. It helps us be more competitive. I compliment him for \noffering that motion to instruct.\n  I also speak in favor of the Stabenow motion to instruct with respect \nto the R tax credit which will be coming up shortly, essentially \nbecause we have to move ever more aggressively to invest more in \nresearch and development in our country. And the current temporary \nnature of the credit just makes no sense.\n  The Senate-passed bill is a credit extension for 2 years. I remind my \ncolleagues that the current credit is expired. It expired at the end of \nlast year. We are now in February. The Senate bill extends it for \ncalendar years 2006 and 2007, and the House bill just has 1 year, 2006.\n  I am for more predictability, more certainty, especially with expect \nto the R tax credit.\n  I also received a letter from the R Credit Coalition, a group \nrepresenting 85 trade associations and more than 1,000 small, medium, \nand large companies. In the manufacturing sector alone, which performs \nnearly 60 percent of all private and industrialized R in the United \nStates, there are 14 million manufacturing employees who get the \nbenefit of this credit.\n  The coalition in their letter said:\n\n       The Coalition believes the Senate-passed provision will \n     help make the credit a more powerful incentive to undertake \n     long-term, high-risk R projects in the United States. \n     Consistent with the provision you and 45 of your Senate \n     colleagues have taken as sponsors of a permanent and \n     strengthened R credit, extending this credit for an \n     additional year will better enable the intended incentive \n     effect of the tax credit to be realized.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                         R Credit Coalition,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 13, 2006.\n     Hon. Charles Grassley,\n     Chairman, Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Max Baucus,\n     Ranking Democrat, Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Baucus: On behalf \n     of the members\n\n[[Page S1112]]\n\n     of the R Credit Coalition, we thank you for your leadership \n     in amending the Tax Relief Act of 2005 to include a two-year \n     extension of a strengthened research tax credit (the ``R'' \n     tax credit). It is critical that the credit be extended and \n     strengthened and the additional length of the proposed \n     extension will provide needed certainty to businesses that \n     are making investment and hiring decisions.\n       The Coalition believes the Senate-passed provision will \n     help make the credit a more powerful incentive to undertake \n     long-term, high-risk R projects in the United States. \n     Consistent with the position you and 45 of your Senate \n     colleagues have taken as sponsors of a permanent and \n     strengthened R credit, extending this credit for an \n     additional year will better enable the intended incentive \n     effect of the tax credit to be realized. The best incentive \n     is one on which businesses can rely and one that applies \n     broadly to all research-intensive companies. The members of \n     the R Credit Coalition applaud your efforts to strengthen \n     this credit and to lengthen its extension period. We look \n     forward to working with you on this issue.\n           Sincerely,\n     Bill Sample,\n       Microsoft Corporation, Chair, R Credit Coalition.\n     Donna Siss Gleason,\n       The Boeing Company, Vice Chair, R Credit Coalition.\n     Keith H. Smith,\n       United Technologies Corporation, Cochair, R Credit \n     Coalition, Government Affairs Committee.\n     Karen Myers,\n       CA, Cochair, R Credit Coalition, Government Affairs \n     Committee.\n     Monica M. McGuire,\n       National Association of Manufacturers, Executive Secretary, \n     R Credit Coalition.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, spending for R will increase in 2006, \nbut America has challenges to face, such as major increases in the \nfunding of offshore operations. The total amount of foreign direct \ninvestment, including R, is shifting heavily towards India and China, \nand competition for qualified researchers will increase markedly over a \nshort period of time.\n  Most important is to keep American jobs. Keep them here, keep them at \nhome. R has some of the most highly paid and intellectually \nstimulating jobs. With offshore operations and foreign R investment \nshifting to India and China, jobs for U.S. workers will decrease in \nthis area.\n  I strongly urge support of both the motion to instruct by Senator \nHatch and also the motion to instruct that will be presented later, I \nassume, by the Senator from Michigan, Ms. Stabenow.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield such time as the Senator from Arkansas may use.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I thank my colleague from Montana, Senator Baucus, who, \nas always, does a tremendous job in helping the entire Senate stay \nfocused on what is important, helping us to reflect on where our values \nlie as Americans, and certainly for us as leaders of this great Nation.\n  I come to the Senate today to once again discuss an issue that is \nnear and dear to my heart, an issue that is of great importance to all \nworking families across this country. As we look now at what working \nfamilies are going through--astronomically high fuel prices, what it is \ncosting them to heat their homes; the cost of health care; the cost of \neducating their children and saving for higher education, which is \ngoing to increase again this year and years to come; trying to be \ncompetitive in their jobs and the global economy--in looking at these \nissues, I and many other Senators have recognized how tough it is for \nworking families across this country.\n  In 2001, and again in 2003, Senator Snowe of Maine and I worked \ntogether, with the help of our chairman on the Committee on Finance, \nSenator Grassley, and our ranking member, Senator Baucus, to ensure \nthat low-income working families with children receive the benefit of \nthe child tax credit. It is so important to remind ourselves: we know \nhow near and dear our children are to us; other people's children are \njust as near and dear to them, regardless of their income level.\n  As the chairman said earlier today, I, too, feel a bit as though I am \ntrapped in that movie ``Groundhog Day,'' although for a different \nreason. I feel that I am trapped in ``Groundhog Day'' life. I have been \nin this instance time and time again, and I come to the Senate today to \nagain ask my colleagues to help me ensure that low-income working \nfamilies are not forgotten as we discuss tax relief. It is absolutely \nessential we put ourselves in the shoes of other working Americans, the \nworking families who are the fabric of this great Nation, and say: We \nbelieve your children are just as important as our children to the \nfuture of this country.\n  I applaud the action taken in the Senate the week before last. I was \npleased we affirmed that the permanency of the child tax credit is a \npriority of the Senate and should be addressed during conference on \nthis tax reconciliation bill. Even though I applaud that effort, I \nstill say it is not enough. It is not enough to not look further and \nsee those working Americans who are still not going to be helped. It is \nnot enough because the credit in its current form does not work for all \nlow-income working families.\n  We can and should take one additional step. As some may be aware, to \nbe eligible for the refundable child tax credit, working families must \nmeet an income threshold. If they do not earn enough, they do not \nqualify for the child credit. The problem is, some of our parents are \nworking full time every week of the year. Yet they still do not earn \nenough to meet the income threshold to qualify for the credit, much \nless to receive a meaningful refund.\n  Heaven forbid we look at what they are making. Is it enough to safely \nand adequately raise their children? We have an obligation to make sure \nthose people, those hard-working Americans who were willing to play by \nthe rules to get a job, to work hard, to perform things that are \nimportant to our quality of life, too, that they have the same \nopportunity to love and nurture their children and work hard to provide \ntheir children a better opportunity than they may have had.\n  I will say this again because it is right and it is important people \nknow. I will say it again to make sure the point is not missed. We have \nfull-time working parents who do not qualify for the child tax credit \nbecause their incomes are simply too low. Again, people playing by the \nrules, working hard so our lives might be a little bit better, yet \nunder minimum wage, they do not make enough.\n  If we are talking about American values, if we are talking about \nfamily values, if we want to reinforce the aspect of work instead of \nhandouts, if we want to reinforce caring for all of America's children \nbecause we know all of America's children are part of our future, our \nfuture leaders, if what we want to do is reinforce working, caring for \nour children, taking the responsibility of our families--that does not \nmean just my children or just a few children; it means all children--\nare we not then going to step up to the plate and say to those hard-\nworking Americans that your children are just as important as my \nchildren?\n  In 2003, the income threshold was set at $10,500. The threshold is \nindexed for inflation and thus has increased the last 2 years. It was \n$10,750 in 2004 and $11,000 in 2005. And, yes, it will go up again in \n2006.\n  Unfortunately, the low-income worker's wage is not increasing at the \nsame pace, or even at all, for that matter, as we look at the low-\nincome working wages that exist in this country. A single working \nmother or father in the State of Arkansas or across this Nation \nperhaps, who makes minimum wage, is going to get $5.15, working a 40-\nhour week, every week of the year. That is not taking a vacation, \ntaking their family to the beach, going to Disney World or anything \nelse. It is working a 40-hour week, every week of the year, 52 weeks \nout of the year, with an income of only $10,712 a year. That came\n\n[[Page S1113]]\n\nin under the threshold, both in 2004 and 2005; it will, most \ndefinitely, come in below the threshold this year, in 2006.\n\n  It is wrong--it is absolutely wrong--to provide this credit to some \nhard-working Americans while leaving others behind. The single, working \nparent who is stocking the shelves in your local grocery store is every \nbit as deserving as the teacher or accountant or insurance salesman who \nqualifies for the credit in its current form. And, yes, they love their \nchildren just as much as you and I love our children and want for them \nall of the great things that are available to young American children \nwhen they can be nurtured and cared for and encouraged and taken care \nof in their families.\n  We must address this inequity, and we must ensure our Tax Code works \nfor all Americans, especially those working parents forced to get by on \nminimum wage.\n  Senator Snowe and I have proposed a solution to this horrible \ninequity. If we were to simply de-index the income threshold and set it \nat a reasonable level, such as $10,000, all full-time working parents, \nincluding those making minimum wage, would qualify.\n  We talk day in and day out about how important our children are. We \ntalk about making them a priority in this country and recognizing how \nthey weave the fabric of this great Nation and the future. We \nunderstand, as parents, it is not easy. It is not easy to raise \nchildren in this environment, with everything from Internet security to \nmaking sure education is available, and health care, including simple \nnutritional needs. We have 600,000 Arkansans living with food \ninsecurity, the majority of which are children.\n  Why is it we cannot take the extra step to make sure that, again, \nthose who are playing by the rules, those who are willing to work, to \nwork to care for their children and their families--we are not going to \ngive them the same benefit of that Tax Code?\n  This is a simple, easy solution Senator Snowe and I have offered to a \nvery serious problem. I will not rest until we get it done. As we \nprepare to enter conference with the House on this tax reconciliation \nbill, I encourage my colleagues to support Senator Snowe and me in our \nefforts to fix this inequity.\n  As many of you may recall, the last time Senator Snowe and I went to \nwork to improve the child tax credit, back during the debate of the \nPresident's tax package in 2003, tax relief for low-income families was \nleft behind in the conference. I hope we have changed. I hope we have \nrefocused ourselves and our priorities. I hope we do recognize all \nworking American families are struggling today with high gas prices, \nthe cost of health care, and higher education--education at all--that \nall working families are struggling to heat and cool their homes with \nhigh energy costs and are struggling to keep the jobs they have in \ntheir globally competitive companies.\n  Please, let's not repeat this mistake again. If the opportunity \narises to take action on the child tax credit in this conference, we \nmust not only extend it, we must ensure that it works for all of \nAmerica's working families.\n  We should always remember that budgets reflect priorities, the \npriorities of those who put those budgets together. We know priorities \ncreate choices. The choices we make in budgets and in decisions on the \nfloor of the Senate and in conferences over such critical issues--our \nchoices--have real and substantive consequences, not just to those \nworking families out there who so desperately want success for their \nchild, but it has consequences for our Nation. If we set our priorities \nso low that we leave behind the children of hard-working American \nfamilies, the consequences for our Nation will be great.\n  I thank you, Mr. President, and again encourage my colleagues to \nsupport the efforts not only of a child tax credit but also making sure \nit is fair to all working families of our Nation.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \nmotion be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Motion to Instruct Conferees\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I have a motion at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Mr. DeWine moves that the managers on the part of the \n     Senate at the conference on the disagreeing votes of the 2 \n     Houses on the Senate amendment to the bill H.R. 4297 (to \n     provide for reconciliation pursuant to the concurrent \n     resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2006 (H. Con. Res. \n     95)) be instructed to accept the veterans' mortgage bonds \n     expansion provisions contained in section 303 of the bill as \n     passed by the House of Representatives with such revisions as \n     are necessary to provide veterans in all 50 States with \n     access to lower-rate mortgages.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, this proposal would instruct the conferees \nto accept the House provision that expands the qualified veterans \nmortgage bond program. The qualified veterans mortgage bond program \nallows States to issue tax-exempt bonds that are used to fund mortgages \nfor our veterans. Because the States borrow this money at low, tax-\nexempt interest rates, they are able to pass that lower rate on to \nveterans for home mortgages. This means veterans are able to finance a \nhome at a lower interest rate than they otherwise would have been able \nto.\n  The program in place today is limited to veterans who served before \n1977. Mr. President, this motion will instruct the conferees to accept \nthe House provision eliminating that limit. By doing so, we can offer \nto all the brave men and women who have served and are serving our \nNation the important benefits of this program.\n  The current program is also limited to veterans who settle in Alaska, \nCalifornia, Oregon, Texas, and Wisconsin. This motion instructs the \nconferees to bring back a provision that would permit veterans of all \nStates to have access to these lower rate mortgages.\n  This is the right thing to do for our veterans. We owe a great debt \nof gratitude to the men and women who have served our country in the \narmed services. These brave men and women, with their honor and \ncourage, have kept our Nation secure and our future bright. They \ndeserve the assistance that we can provide with this mortgage bond \nprogram. It is simple to do and it will have a profound impact on many \nmilitary families. I strongly encourage my colleagues in the Senate to \nsupport it.\n  Mr. President, while Senators cannot cosponsor motions to instruct, \nSenators Santorum, Grassley, Burns, and Chafee have expressed their \nsupport of this motion.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeMint). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \nmatter before the Senate be set aside so I can offer a motion on behalf \nof Senator Menendez.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Motion to Instruct Conferees\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on behalf of the junior Senator from New \nJersey, Mr. Menendez, I offer the following motion to instruct the \nconferees on tax reconciliation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       Mr. Menendez moves that the managers on the part of the \n     Senate at the conference on the disagreeing votes of the two \n     Houses on the Senate amendment to the bill H.R. 4297 (to \n     provide for reconciliation pursuant to the concurrent \n     resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2006 (H. Con. Res. \n     95)) be instructed to report a conference report that \n     includes the Senate-passed ``hold-harmless'' relief from the \n     individual alternative minimum tax (AMT) in 2006, and does \n     not include the extension of lower tax rates on capital gains \n     and dividends.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this motion is to instruct the conferees to \ninsist on relief from the alternative minimum\n\n[[Page S1114]]\n\ntax--known as AMT--in the final bill they report back from the \nconference committee.\n  It reaffirms the Senate's position that AMT relief should take \npriority over extending tax cuts for capital gains and dividends.\n  If the conference agreement fails to include relief from the AMT, 15 \nmillion taxpayers will face higher tax bills this year.\n  The Senate has expressed its support for AMT relief two times as this \nlegislation has made its way through the legislative process.\n  First, the Finance Committee included AMT relief in the bill that it \nreported to the Senate floor.\n  Then, during floor consideration the Senate overwhelmingly approved \nthe amendment offered by Senators Menendez, Schumer, Kerry, Feinstein \nand others that expressed the Senate's desire that AMT relief take \npriority over tax cuts for capital gains and dividends.\n  That amendment was approved by the Senate by a vote of 73 to 24.\n  The conferees for the Senate should respect the Senate's instructions \nand include AMT relief in the final bill.\n  There are two reasons that the Senate conferees should insist on \nincluding AMT relief in the final bill and reject tax cuts for capital \ngains and dividends. First, AMT relief is needed to protect taxpayers \nthis year. Married couples with children are most affected by the AMT.\n  Absent any relief for next year, nearly three-quarters of married \ncouples with two or more kids and income between $75,000 and $100,000 \nwill be subject to the AMT.\n  In contrast, almost 50 percent of the benefits of a reduction in the \ntax rates on capital gain and dividend income goes to taxpayers with $1 \nmillion or more, which is .3 percent of all taxpayers. The average tax \ncut for these taxpayers will be about $32,000.\n  The higher AMT exemption levels that were enacted in 2003 expired at \nthe end of last year. Without this provision, middle-class taxpayers \nwill be hit with higher AMT liabilities when they file their 2006 \nreturns. The lower tax rates for capital gains and dividends do not \nexpire until 2009.\n  Second, extending lower tax rates on capital gains and dividends \nreflects misplaced priorities. The benefits of lower taxes on capital \ngains and dividends go disproportionately to wealthy taxpayers.\n  According to an analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, \njointly run by the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution, about \n50 percent of the benefits of lowering taxes on capital gains and \ndividend income goes to taxpayers with $1 million or more of income.\n  In 2005, the average tax cut for millionaires was nearly $38,000. In \ncontrast, 92 percent of taxpayers received a tax cut of less than $100 \nas a result of the reduced tax rates on capital gains and dividends.\n  At a time when we face record budget deficits, Congress should not \nconsider tax cuts whose benefits so clearly go to the most well off in \nour country.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, less than 2 weeks ago we debated the \nimportance of addressing the individual alternative minimum tax, AMT. \nWithout congressional action, this year 17 million families will be \nimpacted by the AMT. And this problem is growing. Without a permanent \nsolution to the AMT, as many as 30 million families will be impacted by \nit in 2010.\n  We all seem to agree that the alternative minimum tax needs to be \naddressed, but we differ on how big a priority it should be. Very \nrecently, 73 Members of this body voted to address the AMT before \naddressing tax cuts that do not expire until the end of 2008. This \nsense of the Senate specifically stated that ``protecting middle class \nfamilies from the alternative minimum tax should be a higher priority \nfor Congress in 2006 than extending a tax cut that does not expire \nuntil the end of 2008.''\n  Some of my colleagues believe we can address both the AMT and extend \nthe capital gains and dividends tax cut, but I am concerned this will \nbe difficult to do within the confines of a $70 billion tax bill. The \nHouse has made their position clear that they would rather address AMT \noutside the reconciliation tax bill. This is troubling because it would \nlikely result in a total of over $100 billion in tax relief that is not \npaid for. We cannot afford another costly debt-financed tax cut. The \nSenate-passed bill does include some revenue offsets, but I do not \nexpect the conference report to include any revenue offsets.\n  Not less than a week after we debated the alternative minimum tax, \nthe administration's budget submitted to Congress for fiscal year 2007 \nfailed to adequately address the AMT. Once again, the budget makes the \n2001 and 2003 tax cuts permanent but ignores the looming problem of the \nAMT.\n  The President only chose to address the AMT for 1 year--2006. He \nchose not to address it for fiscal year 2007. In addition, the relief \nprovided in the budget for 2006 is not as generous as the AMT relief in \nthe Senate-passed bill. Under the budget proposal, an additional 1.2 \nmillion families would be impacted by the AMT. The Senate-passed bill \nprevents additional taxpayers from being impacted by the AMT. The \nbudget deliberately leaves out a more permanent solution for the AMT \nfor two reasons. First, the AMT would add additional costs to the \nbudget. Second, the AMT masks the true costs of the 2001 and 2003 tax \ncuts.\n  Back during the debate on the Economic Growth and Tax Relief \nReconciliation Act of 2001, I offered an amendment that would have \nexempted taxpayers with incomes of $100,000 or less from the AMT. The \nreason I offered this amendment was that I was concerned about the \nimpact of the AMT on families who were never meant to be affected by \nit.\n  In 1998, we began to notice that something was happening that was \nunintended--the AMT was beginning to encroach on middle class \ntaxpayers. At that time, the AMT was expected to impact over 17 million \ntaxpayers in 2010. The AMT problem resulted because the regular tax \nsystem is indexed for inflation, while the personal exemptions, \nstandard, deduction, and AMT are not. Under the AMT, exemption amounts \nand the tax brackets remain constant. This has the perverse consequence \nof punishing taxpayers for the mere fact that their incomes rose due to \ninflation.\n  The AMT has another perverse consequence. It punishes families for \nhaving children. The more children a family has, the lower the income \nnecessary to trigger the AMT. For example, if no action is taken in \n2006, a family with four children with an income of $58,500 would be \nsubject to the AMT while a family with one child would have to make \n$72,000 to be affected.\n  As we debated the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act \nof 2001, I stressed the fact that the legislation would result in more \nindividuals being impacted by the AMT and that not addressing the AMT \nhid the real cost of the tax cuts. This holds true today. Revenue \nestimates show us that it would be cheaper to address the AMT if the \ntax cuts were repealed than if the tax cuts were made permanent.\n  A choice was made in 2001 to provide more tax cuts to those with \nincomes of over a million dollars rather than addressing a looming tax \nproblem for the middle class. The Economic Growth and Tax Relief \nReconciliation Act of 2001 did include a small adjustment to the AMT, \nbut it was not enough. We knew at the time that the number of taxpayers \nsubject to the AMT would continue to rise steadily. The combination of \nlower tax cuts and a minor adjustment to the AMT would cause the AMT to \nexplode.\n  The amendment that I offered would have simply exempted those with \nincomes of less than $100,000 from the AMT and it was offset by \ndecreasing the amount that the top rate would be reduced. It would have \nreduced the top rate to 37 percent instead of 35 percent. This \namendment was not a panacea to the AMT, but we would not be in the \nsituation that we are today because the amendment would have countered \nthe interaction between the tax cuts and the AMT by exempting middle \nclass taxpayers. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that the \namendment would have prevented 18 million taxpayers from being impacted \nby the AMT.\n  Each year that we wait to address the AMT, more taxpayers are \nimpacted and the cost of addressing it increases. We missed an \nopportunity in 2001 to address the AMT. Repeatedly, the AMT has been \npushed aside to give priority to making the tax cuts for the wealthiest \nAmericans permanent. So often we\n\n[[Page S1115]]\n\nhear that the bulk of the tax cuts assist the average American family. \nThis is ironic because by 2010, the AMT will take back 21.5 percent of \nthe promised tax breaks for individuals making between $75,000 and \n$100,000 per year and 47 percent from individuals making between \n$100,000 and $200,000. However, households with annual income over \n$1,000,000 will only lose 9.2 percent of the tax cuts.\n  Once again today, we have the opportunity to choose to help hard-\nworking families or very wealthy investors. We can choose to protect 17 \nmillion middle class families by voting for the motion offered by my \ncolleague, Senator Menendez. Not addressing the AMT this year would \nresult in tax increases as large as $3,640. The other choice is to \nextend the capital gains and dividends rate cuts that go to households \nwith income over $1 million. Over 50 percent of the benefit goes to \nthese households that make up only 0.2 percent of all households. These \ntax cuts do not expire until the end of 2008.\n  Last week, the Senate Finance Committee heard from Treasury Secretary \nSnow that the capital gains and dividends tax cut helps individuals \nwith income of less than $50,000. I believe that he was trying to make \nthe argument that more middle class taxpayers would benefit from the \ncapital gains tax relief than from AMT relief. I disagree. The \nimportant statistics to look at are the percentage of income that is \ncapital gains and dividends and the amount of the tax cut. In 2009, \nthose making over $1 million would receive an average tax cut of \n$32,000 and those with incomes below $50,000 would receive an average \ntax cut of $11. IRS income tax data for 2003, which is the most recent \ndata, shows that capital gains and dividends income accounts for nearly \none-third of all income for millionaires. For those making less than \n$100,000, capital gains and dividends income accounts for 1.4 percent \nof total income and it is even less for those with incomes of $50,000.\n  I urge my colleagues to choose hard-working families. We can \nreexamine the issue of capital gains and dividends tax cuts once we \nhave our fiscal house in order. The budget that was sent to Congress \nlast week projects the largest deficit in history for fiscal year 2006. \nIn times of deficits, we have to carefully choose our priorities. It is \ntime for Congress to address the AMT which has turned into the family \ntax.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask any motions be set aside so the \nSenator from Michigan can offer a motion to instruct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                      Motion to Instruct Conferees\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I thank our leader on the Committee on \nFinance, Mr. Baucus, for his leadership on so many different issues.\n  I send a motion to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       Ms. Stabenow moves that the managers on the part of the \n     Senate at the conference on the disagreeing votes of the 2 \n     Houses on the Senate amendment to the bill H.R. 4297 (to \n     provide for reconciliation pursuant to the concurrent \n     resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2006 (H. Con. Res. \n     95)) be instructed to insist on the inclusion in the final \n     conference report of a permanent extension of the credit for \n     increasing research activities and to reject any extension of \n     the tax rate for capital gains and dividends which does not \n     expire until 2009.\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise this evening to introduce a \nmotion to instruct conferees to extend the R tax credit permanently \nand offset costs related to that by striking capital gains and \ndividends provisions of the House bill in the conference committee. I \nrealize my colleague from Utah has introduced something similar to \nextend the R tax credit permanently, which I support, but I believe \nthe most responsible approach is to provide as much of an offset as \npossible so we are not extending the national debt which is already the \nlargest in our Nation's history.\n  This is a very difficult time for Michigan families. Michigan lost \n11,000 manufacturing jobs since 2000. Last week, GM announced more bad \nnews. Plant closings and job losses are becoming a common headline in \nour newspaper. There needs to be a sense of urgency in Washington about \nhelping to protect and maintain these good-paying jobs and the way of \nlife these jobs have offered for Americans. Our middle-class way of \nlife is truly at risk. We are still not seeing any action from this \nadministration. I was so disappointed to see the President did not \nmention the word ``manufacturing,'' in his State of the Union Address, \ndespite all that is happening and all that needs to be done on behalf \nof Michigan families, Michigan businesses, and those across the country \nthat are affected.\n  People in my State are worried about their jobs, they are worried \nabout the fact that they might lose their pension that they worked for, \nfor 30 years. Who would have thought, in the United States of America, \npeople would have to worry about paying into a pension system and \npossibly not having that when they retire? That is immoral.\n  They see their health care premiums continuing to skyrocket every \nyear, they are struggling to fill their gas tank and pay their home \nheating bill and are feeling squeezed on all sides. We need to take \nthat seriously because there are things we can do to help turn that \naround.\n  What does the House bill dealing with taxes propose to do to help \nmiddle-class families? Absolutely nothing. Instead, it gives more tax \ncuts to the wealthiest few.\n  We can do better. We must do better for the people we represent. \nHard-working families should be able to have a good-paying job, send \ntheir kids to college, retire with dignity, including health care and a \npension and Social Security. We need to lower health care costs which \nare hurting American manufacturers and promote new health IT \ntechnologies that can save billions in health care costs. I was pleased \nto see the President mention that in the State of the Union.\n  Senator Snowe and I have legislation, working with colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle. We can get this done and save hundreds of billions \nof dollars that can go back into lowering health care costs and paying \nfor access to health care for our families.\n  We need to protect people's pensions and uphold the fundamental \nprinciple that if you work hard and pay into a retirement fund, you get \nevery cent you have earned and you deserve.\n  We must also investigate and enforce our trade laws. Countries such \nas China and Japan should be required to play by the rules, stop \nmanipulating their currency. This is what we should be voting on now. \nHow to save and strengthen our middle class, our way of life.\n  One answer that would be extremely positive would be to make the R \ntax credit permanent, to help continue to spur innovation into the \nfuture. As we all know, the way to profitability for struggling \nmanufacturers is through innovation and education.\n  The House bill only budgets a 1-year extension of the R tax credit, \nleaving businesses to worry about whether longer term projects will be \nterminated. A 1-year extension undermines our commitment to innovation \nand economic prosperity. Instead, the House bill provides $50 billion \nin tax breaks for the wealthy few who do not have to worry about losing \ntheir jobs or pensions tomorrow or struggling to pay their bills.\n  We need to be investing in our manufacturers and our workers to \nprepare for the future by planting seeds for the next innovative idea. \nI am very proud that in Michigan we have been the heart of so much \ninnovation. We create ideas. We build great products, not just \nautomobiles but furniture and all kinds of products. And we are on the \ncutting edge today of new innovations.\n  But it is time to reinvest in what has led our country to economic \nprosperity and to support these on-going efforts. We have the best \ncolleges and the brightest minds in the world. We know American workers \ncan compete with any workers from any country if we make it a priority \nto invest in education and innovation--and, by the way, if we enforce \nour trade laws so other countries are not cheating--and change the way \nwe fund health care. That is the prescription for success, for \nmaintaining our way of life as Americans.\n  Countries such as Japan and China have been doubling and tripling \ntheir investments in R over the last decade. Japan, which has always \ninvested in R, increased their funding by 25\n\n[[Page S1116]]\n\npercent. Korea has doubled their R China has tripled their R In \nChina, engineering professors and graduate students even receive \nbonuses every time they are published in an international journal.\n  Our Federal Government must be a strong partner with American \nmanufacturers, American businesses, and American workers, and support \ninnovation in this country for the next generation of workers.\n  My home State of Michigan invests over $20 billion in R \nexpenditures--the second highest of any State, according to the \nNational Science Foundation. Although Federal investments in R only \ncontribute 17 percent of total investments, these Federal funds are \nused to attract even more research dollars from businesses. It is a \ngreat investment for us.\n  It makes perfect sense for us in the Federal Government to help spur \nthis innovation by being partners with the private sector. In total, \nabout $25 billion is provided by the Federal Government and over $200 \nbillion by businesses. This partnership in innovation is at the center \nof American companies competing in the global marketplace. Everyone \nknows that to stay ahead, we need to invest in the future. That means \neducation. That means innovation.\n  I might say, it does not mean accepting the cuts the President has \nproposed--the largest cuts in the 26-year history of the Department of \nEducation--over $2 billion in cuts proposed in this budget. That \ncertainly is going in the wrong direction. But permanently extending \nthe R tax credit goes in the right direction, and helping to pay for \nthat also goes in the right direction of fiscal responsibility.\n  As I indicated before, the distinguished Senator from Utah, Mr. \nHatch, has offered a motion to instruct on a permanent extension of the \nR tax credit without an offset--in other words, without paying for \nthat. I would suggest there is a more fiscally responsible approach and \nthat we are not providing a long-term incentive for investment by just \nextending the credit for a year at a time or by not paying for it. I \nbelieve we need to have a permanent extension of the R tax credit, \nbut we need to do that in a way which is fiscally responsible.\n  This debate this evening is really about our values and about our \npriorities and who will benefit from the tax bill. Are we going to give \nanother $50 billion in tax cuts to those who are most blessed and \nextend the capital gains tax cut which is not even going to expire for \n2 years or are we going to help people who are trying to create jobs \nand working men and women right now, manufacturers who right now need \nsome support as they move into the future to compete internationally \nand businesses that right now need our support, by extending the R \ntax credit so they have the partnership they need, the support they \nneed for those new ideas which will allow them to compete on into the \nfuture?\n  This is about what is happening to families right now. In Michigan, \npeople are asking the President and asking us to look at what is \nhappening to families at this moment and to take action now.\n  Let's stop China and Japan from cheating by stealing our patents or \nby counterfeiting--counterfeit autoparts, for example, is a $12 billion \nindustry which has cost over 200,000 jobs in this country--or by \nmanipulating their currency. Let's force them to play by the rules and \nhave a level playing field, but turn around and look at what they are \ndoing on R and education. While they are cheating and stealing our \nideas, they are educating more engineers and more scientists and those \nwho will be competing with our workers. We need to turn that around, \nmake them play by the rules, change the way we fund health care in our \ncountry, protect our pensions, and then aggressively invest in \neducation and innovation.\n\n  To see the kind of bold, aggressive investment we need means we need \nto extend the R tax credit. We need to send a strong message to \nbusinesses around this country that this is a permanent tax credit, the \nR tax credit. We also need to send a message that we are going to \nchoose, when choices have to be made, between those who need the \nsupport right now to keep jobs here in America and those who down the \nroad may be interested in having an additional tax cut on top of those \nthey have already received. I believe it is about the future of our \ncountry, which approach will create opportunity, which approach will \ncreate jobs for the future.\n  My vote is with our manufacturers who are deciding, maybe at this \nvery moment, whether to lay off more people in Michigan or around the \ncountry, who need this tax credit to invest in the future of their \ncompanies. That is my priority, not a few, most blessed in this country \nwho have a capital gains tax cut in place until 2008--it does not even \nexpire until 2008--those who are not worried today about whether that \npension is going to be there or whether they can pay their heating bill \nor whether they can send their kids to college or whether they are \ngoing to have a job tomorrow. They have a tax cut in place which does \nnot even stop until 2008.\n  We can do better than the bill that was certainly passed by the House \nof Representatives. I hope the conference committee will do better. I \nurge support for my motion to instruct, with a clear message. This is \nabout bold innovation for the future, permanently extending the R tax \ncredit. It is about fiscal responsibility. And it is about making the \nright choices and values that say we are going to focus on those today, \nwe are going to pay for this by focusing on those right now, those \nbusinesses right now which need our help, and make those families a \npriority for us.\n  It is about our way of life in this country. It is a fight we can win \nif we are serious about it. And I believe innovation is an important \npart of our future. I urge the support of my colleagues for this motion \nto instruct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise for the purpose of offering some \nmotions to instruct for myself and my colleagues.\n\n\n                      Motion To Instruct Conferees\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I send the first motion to the desk and ask for its \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending motion is set \naside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Mr. Grassley moves that the managers on the part of the \n     Senate at the conference on the disagreeing votes of the 2 \n     Houses on the Senate amendment to the bill H.R. 4297 (to \n     provide for reconciliation pursuant to the concurrent \n     resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2006 (H. Con. Res. \n     95)) be instructed to insist on the inclusion in the final \n     conference report of the funding to support the health needs \n     of America's veterans and military personnel contained in \n     section 315 of the Senate amendment and the funding to \n     strengthen America's military contained in title VI of the \n     Senate amendment.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, in explaining the rationale for my \nmotion to instruct, I will be referring to other motions to instruct \nthat two Senators on the other side have put in place, Senator Dodd of \nConnecticut and Senator Reed of Rhode Island.\n  The Dodd motion to instruct is yet another episode in the tale of the \n``groundhogization'' of this tax relief reconciliation bill, a long \njourney. The Senate adopted the alternative to the Dodd amendment, a \nGrassley amendment, that passed, including the following Budget Act \nwaiver language:\n\n       Waive all provisions of the Budget Act and budget \n     resolutions necessary for the consideration of the pending \n     amendment to this bill, and for the inclusion of the language \n     of the pending amendment in consideration of an amendment \n     between Houses.\n\n  That is what we added back on February 2 to S. 2020. The Dodd motion \ninstructs conferees to proceed by ignoring this waiver language. You \nsee, the waiver language only applies for the purposes of our action in \nthe Senate. If Senator Dodd were to prevail, the conferees could not \nfollow his directive without violating the Budget Act. It is because \nthe Dodd motion deals with outlays. We can't do outlays in a budget \nreconciliation package. I might add that the Reed motion that we expect \nto vote on tomorrow suffers from the same defect. The conferees, even \nif they were inclined, can't return from conference with a provision \nthat contains outlays.\n  We all know this is a political season. If you look at this motion, \nand if you look at the Reed motion, both cannot\n\n[[Page S1117]]\n\nbe adopted and followed. You can draw your own conclusion, then, why \nthey are adopted, unless the Members don't know that this is a \nparliamentary situation. I can't believe they don't know what that \nparliamentary situation is.\n  While we are at it, I am going to offer a motion to clarify what the \nDodd and Reed motions are all about. Basically, if you support the \nprinciples of providing more health care for veterans, the supposed \npurpose of the Dodd amendment, and, secondly, assisting our troops with \nbody armor, the supposed purpose of the Reed amendment, then vote for \nthe Grassley motion. If you support these two principles but don't \nsupport a tax increase on America's seniors, at a higher cost of \ncapital for American business, support the Grassley motion. If you just \nwant an increase, then vote for the Dodd motion.\n  I will summarize it this way: I appreciate Senator Dodd's attention \nto the issue of our veterans health care needs. This issue is of utmost \nimportance to the Members of the Senate, as evidenced by the fact that \nwe appropriated a massive amount of extra money last fall for the \nfiscal year we are in now to meet the needs of veterans, particularly \nthose who were not recognized, people returning wounded from Iraq. But \nmy colleagues suggest that in order to provide this support, we should \ngive up the important economic tax policy of reduced capital gains and \ndividends tax, the present tax policy, just continue it for 2 more \nyears so that people have a long-term view of what the tax policy is so \nthat they know what they are going to invest.\n  The Dodd motion claims to be paid for by capital gains, but capital \ngains offsets don't even come into play until the year 2009. I have \noffered a motion that supports military health care facilities, but we \ndon't tie it up with an offset that is 3 long years down the road.\n  You will remember that the Senate debated this issue on Groundhog Day \nand voted to accept my amendment that provides the same benefits but \ndoes not raise taxes to pay for it. I urge my colleagues to vote \nagainst Senator Dodd's motion and to support my motion to instruct the \nconferees on the amendment we have already passed.\n  In regard to what Senator Reed is trying to do with his motion to \ninstruct, this is the issue of funding for our military. Proper funding \nfor those serving our country is not a controversial issue. The method \nof providing this funding for our military is, on the other hand, being \nmade into an unnecessarily controversial issue. My colleague suggests \nthat in order to provide for this funding, we eliminate a tax benefit \nthat doesn't even arise until the year 2009, similar to the same issue \nin the Dodd amendment. I ask how this would provide the funds so badly \nneeded this very day to ensure that we meet the operational needs of \nour courageous military service personnel.\n  I offered an amendment that supports the operational needs of our \nmilitary without tying it to an offset that is 3 long years down the \nroad.\n  Again, in an effort not to sound repetitive, you will remember that \nthe Senate debated this issue also on Groundhog Day and voted to accept \nmy amendment that provides the same benefits but does not raise taxes \nto pay for them. So I urge my colleagues to vote against Senator Reed's \nmotion and to support my motion to instruct conferees on the amendment \nwe have already passed.\n  To sum up, if you are against a tax increase but for veterans health \ncare and properly equipping our military, vote for the Grassley motion. \nIf you are for a tax increase, then look elsewhere to our colleagues \nwho are offering their version of it.\n\n\n                      Motion To Instruct Conferees\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am sending several motions to the desk \nnow. I ask that these be taken up together. I ask that the clerk would \nread each one at a time because I want to speak to each one. I would \nask the clerk to read the first one.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending motion is set \naside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n       Mr. Grassley moves that the managers on the part of the \n     Senate at the conference on the disagreeing votes of the 2 \n     Houses on the Senate amendment to the bill H.R. 4297 (to \n     provide for reconciliation pursuant to the concurrent \n     resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2006 (H. Con. Res. \n     95)) be instructed to report a final conference report that \n     includes the ``hold-harmless'' relief from the individual \n     alternative minimum tax in 2006 (sections 106 and 107 of the \n     amendment passed by the Senate) to protect middle class \n     families and includes an extension of lower tax rates on \n     capital gains and dividends (based on section 203 of the bill \n     passed by the House of Representatives) to protect tax cuts \n     for middle class families.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the motion to instruct that was just \nread is mine. Simply stated, this is a motion that says there are \nsufficient funds to do both alternative minimum tax and capital gains \nand dividends and that we should do both--in other words, as an \ninstruction to conferees.\n\n\n                      Motion to Instruct Conferees\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask the clerk to read the motion that \nI am introducing for Senator Lott, listed as No. 3.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending motion is laid \naside and the clerk will report the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Mr. Lott moves that the managers on the part of the Senate \n     at the conference on the disagreeing votes of the 2 Houses on \n     the Senate amendment to the bill H.R. 4297 (to provide for \n     reconciliation pursuant to the concurrent resolution on the \n     budget for fiscal year 2006 (H. Con. Res. 95)) be instructed \n     to report a final conference report that includes the repeal \n     of the individual alternative minimum tax (based on sections \n     106 and 107 of the amendment passed by the Senate.)\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, as I said, I am doing that for Senator \nLott of Mississippi. I think it is self explanatory. Just to reiterate, \nthis motion, on behalf of Senator Lott, calls for full and permanent \nrepeal of the alternative minimum tax.\n\n\n                      Motion to Instruct Conferees\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I now go to motion No. 4, which is for \nSenator Hutchison.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending motion will be \nset aside, and the clerk will report the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Mrs. Hutchison moves that the managers on the part of the \n     Senate at the conference on the disagreeing votes of the 2 \n     Houses on the Senate amendments to the bill H.R. 4297 (to \n     provide for reconciliation pursuant to the concurrent \n     resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2006 (H. Con. Res. \n     95)) be instructed to insist on the inclusion in the final \n     conference report of a permanent extension of the election to \n     deduct State and local general sales taxes (based on section \n     105 of the amendment passed by the Senate).\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this is repetitive, but I will state \nthis for Senator Hutchison. This resolution of instruction calls for a \npermanent deduction of State and local general sales tax.\n\n\n                      Motion to Instruct Conferees\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I offer motion No. 5 for Senator \nSantorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending motion is set \naside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Mr. Santorum moves that the managers on the part of the \n     Senate at the conference on the disagreeing votes of the 2 \n     Houses on the Senate amendment to the bill H.R. 4297 (to \n     provide for reconciliation pursuant to the concurrent \n     resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2006 (H. Con. Res. \n     95)) be instructed to report a final conference report that \n     includes a permanent extension of the above-the-line \n     deduction for tuition and fees (based on section 103 of the \n     amendment passed by the Senate).\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this motion I offer on behalf of Senator \nSantorum of Pennsylvania would make permanent the above-the-line \ndeduction for tuition and fees for college.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I offer this motion to instruct with \nregard to the college tuition deduction. As I have noted on other \noccasions, this bill is really a ``tax increase prevention'' bill. One \nof the many important elements is the college tuition deduction. This \nprovision was established in the 2001 tax relief bill and provides an \nabove-the-line deduction for higher education expenses, commonly called \nthe ``college tuition deduction.'' The eligibility for the deduction is \nlimited based on income and is aimed at helping middle-class American \nfamilies that are struggling to meet the rising\n\n[[Page S1118]]\n\ncost of college tuition. It benefits students and their families at all \ntypes of institutions--from community colleges to 4-year schools, and \nboth public and private institutions.\n  However, because we have had to slow-walk this bill with some foot-\ndragging across the aisle, this deduction expired on December 31, 2005. \nNonetheless, it is important that we not only extend this provision, \nbut make it permanent. The college tuition deduction is an important \nand popular education tax benefit, particularly for the middle class. \nIt is not available to taxpayers with income above $80,000--$160,000 in \nthe case of joint returns.\n  In 2003--the last year for which official data are available--more \nthan 3 \\1/2\\ million Americans benefited from the tuition deduction, \nwith nearly $7 billion in college tuition costs covered by the \ndeduction--an increase of nearly 9 percent from the previous year. Tax \nincentives for college tuition helped nearly 11 million Americans \nrealize the dream of a college degree. This represents more than two-\nthirds of all college students. In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, \nover 150,000 families and students took advantage of this deduction. \nThe tuition deduction is a crucial part of our education tax incentives \nand must be made permanent. We should send the message to parents of \nhigh school students that this deduction will be there when their \nstudents begin college.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this motion and support these \nfamilies and students striving for a college education.\n\n\n                      Motion to Instruct Conferees\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I turn to motion No. 6, which is my own. \nI ask for the reading of it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending motion will be \nlaid aside, and the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Mr. Grassley moves that the managers on the part of the \n     Senate at the conference on the disagreeing votes of the two \n     Houses on the Senate amendment to the bill H.R. 4297 be \n     instructed to report a reconciliation conference report \n     ensuring that in 2009 and 2010, the international \n     competitiveness of the United States in attracting capital \n     investment, and therefore job creation, is not weakened \n     further by a higher combined corporate and individual income \n     tax rate on corporate and capital income as a result of a \n     higher dividend tax rate, based on the following:\n       (1) In 2005, the combined maximum corporate tax rate and \n     individual dividend tax rate in the United States was 50.8 \n     percent. This rate was the eighth highest rate in the thirty-\n     nation Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, \n     taking into account both national and subnational taxes.\n       (2) If the top federal tax rate on dividend income would \n     have been thirty-five percent, instead of fifteen percent, \n     the combined tax rate would have been 62.9 percent, and would \n     have been the second highest combined corporate and \n     individual tax rate on corporate income in the OECD, behind \n     only Japan.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I offer this motion instructing \nconferees that in the years 2009 and 2010, the international \ncompetitiveness of the United States in attracting capital investment, \nand therefore job creation, is not weakened further by higher combined \ncorporate and individual increased tax rates on corporate and capital \nincome as a result of the higher dividend rate.\n\n\n                      Motion to Instruct Conferees\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I send a motion to the desk that I am \ngoing to file and not discuss at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending motion is laid \naside, and the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Mr. Grassley moves that the managers on the part of the \n     Senate at the conference on the disagreeing votes of the 2 \n     Houses on the Senate amendments to the bill H.R. 4297 (to \n     provide for reconciliation pursuant to the concurrent \n     resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2006 (H.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 8 p.m. \ntonight, the Senate proceed to a vote in relation to the Grassley \nmotion on veterans, to be followed by a vote in relation to the Dodd \nmotion on veterans, with no amendments in order on either motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask that the pending motions be set \naside so the Senator from New Jersey can offer his motion. Obviously, \nunder the rules, he has at least a half hour, maybe even longer. \nSenator Schumer from New York is coming over. Under the rules, he would \nhave the same length of time. We are going to vote about 8 o'clock, \nbut, of course, that can slip a little to accommodate the Senators from \nNew Jersey and New York. I counsel my friends from New Jersey and New \nYork to not use all of their time unless they really want to. I admire \nthe Senator from New Jersey. He is concise and to the point in his \npresentation.\n\n\n                      Motion to Instruct Conferees\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npending motion be set aside, and I send a motion to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending motion will be \nset aside. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Mr. Lautenberg moves that the managers on the part of the \n     Senate at the conference on the disagreeing votes of the 2 \n     Houses on the Senate amendment to the bill H.R. 4297 (to \n     provide for reconciliation pursuant to the concurrent \n     resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2006 (H. Con. Res. \n     95)) be instructed to report a final conference report that \n     does not increase the national debt of the United States.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I want to discuss this motion to \ninstruct conferees that I bring to this bill. You see here a display of \na credit card. It is drawn on the ``Bank of our Children's Future.'' My \namendment is simple. It asks the conferees, please, do not increase our \nnational debt.\n  A lot of what we do around here is hidden and complicated Federal \nbudget rhetoric. But to put matters simply, this bill allows President \nBush to charge another $50 billion on the credit card of the United \nStates of America. But when he leaves office, who is going to pay the \ndebt that is left behind? Certainly, it will not be their rich or \ninfamous friends. They are guaranteed to be safe from the bill \ncollector. The reality is that the President is going to leave \nrepayment of this credit card debt to our kids and our grandchildren. I \ndon't want to have that burden on my grandchildren or my children. They \nwork hard and they pay their debts and they pay their taxes--my \nchildren, I am talking about; my grandchildren are too young. They are \nwilling to pay their taxes and they are proud of this country of ours.\n  The Democrats want to pay for these tax cuts by ending giveaways to \nrich special interests. But the Republican side said: No, no, don't \npersecute millionaires.\n  I had a very successful business career. It happened because I live \nin America and America responds to ingenuity and hard work. I don't \nmind paying my taxes. I want to pay my taxes to be sure that America is \nstrong internally, not just on the weapons front but strong in \ncharacter, strong in mission.\n  My colleagues on the other side, all good folks, will not admit they \nare passing this burden on to future generations. They claim they are \ngoing to cut spending to make up the difference.\n  Are they? As President Bush insists, are they willing to cut Medicare \nand make health care more expensive for seniors? Are they, as President \nBush insists, willing to cut student loans? Isn't tuition expensive \nenough for the average family in America? Are they, our colleagues on \nthe other side, as President Bush insists, going to eliminate the Safe \nand Drug-Free Schools Program? Are they willing to cut the Head Start \nProgram for children who don't have the benefit of being in a home \nwhere they can learn, who don't have the benefit of guidance from \nparents often? Those children often get their only nutritional meal in \na facility that is supported by the Federal Government. We are now only \nserving 800,000 out of 1.6 million children who would qualify.\n  Even if we do all these things, we are still going to be in the hole \nwith massive deficits because of the President's\n\n[[Page S1119]]\n\ninsistence on irresponsible tax cuts, and I use the word advisedly.\n  I know something about balancing budgets. I was a senior Democrat on \nthe Senate Budget Committee that produced the first balanced budget in \n30 years. We did such a good job that when President Bush took the oath \nof office, he was presented with a rosy financial picture like no \nPresident in the history of our country has ever seen.\n  We had budget surpluses as far as the eye could see. In 2000, we had \na budget surplus of $236 billion. In 2001, President Bush enjoyed a \nsurplus of $128 billion. We were ready to pay off our national debt by \nthe end of President Bush's last term. We were in the middle of the \nlongest economic expansion in the history of our country. But the \nRepublicans plunged into massive tax breaks for the wealthy and the \nspecial interests, tax breaks that will cost $3.4 trillion to make them \npermanent over the next decade. One-third of that, more than $1 \ntrillion, will go to the richest 1 percent of our population.\n  So here is how the Republican tax cuts translate. If you make $1 \nmillion a year, you get an average tax cut of $136,000, but if you make \nless than $20,000 a year, you get a whopping $19. To what end? Instead \nof paying off our national credit card bill, President Bush and the \nRepublican majority are set to double our national debt. If we continue \non this path, our national debt will be more than $12 trillion by 2011.\n  With this bill, we are being asked to approve another $50 billion \ncharge on our credit card. The most tragic thing is that there is no \nreason to charge these tax cuts to the national credit card.\n  When we were considering this bill a few weeks ago, our senior \ncolleague on the Budget Committee, Senator Conrad, offered a way to pay \nfor these tax cuts by closing corporate loopholes. Closing these \nloopholes would have shut down abusive foreign tax shelters. I don't \nunderstand why we should give cover to abusive foreign tax shelters. It \nwould have made polluters pay to clean up the damage they cause to our \nenvironment, it would have required tax withholding on payments to \nFederal contractors, such as Halliburton, just like every American has \non their paycheck. Every Member on this side of the aisle voted for \nbudget discipline, and every Member of the other party voted for budget \nrecklessness.\n  We still have a chance to put a stop to this. We can adopt my motion. \nIt is simple. It says to the conferees: Don't increase our national \ndebt. Is that too much to ask, don't increase our national debt?\n  Of course, we could go ahead and get a second mortgage on the White \nHouse or this Capitol Building or the Pentagon. Every day people across \nAmerica will take a second mortgage in a similar situation. ``Similar \nsituation'' means when your debt exceeds your ability to pay it down. \nThe administration is willing to do that.\n  So if my colleagues think we should saddle our children and \ngrandchildren with more debt, then I suggest they oppose my motion, but \nif they think it is wrong to run up our Nation's debt so special \ninterests, such as Halliburton and polluters, can get off scot-free, \nthen vote for my motion.\n  Every American's share of the national debt now is $27,529. This bill \nraises that debt another $170 per adult and child in this country. By \nvoting for my motion, we say no to debt for our kids.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this motion and show that they want \nsome fiscal responsibility put into place.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I see several Senators on the floor. I \nbelieve--and perhaps someone can correct me--the Senator from New York \nwas here earlier.\n\n\n                      Motion to Instruct Conferees\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I wish to offer a motion.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask that the pending motions be set \naside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Mr. Schumer moves that the managers on the part of the \n     Senate at the conference on the disagreeing votes of the 2 \n     Houses on the Senate amendment to the bill H.R. 4297 (to \n     provide for reconciliation pursuant to the concurrent \n     resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2006 (H. Con. Res. \n     95)) be instructed to report a conference report that \n     includes the Senate-passed provision to extend the above-the-\n     line deduction for tuition and fees through December 31, 2009 \n     (section 103), before it includes the House-passed extension \n     of lower tax rates on capital gains and dividends (section \n     203) given budget constraints, noting that a conference \n     report which maintains the tuition deduction will provide \n     needed tax relief to more than 4,000,000 American families \n     each year that are struggling to keep pace with rising \n     tuition costs.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, in the Senate-passed tax reconciliation \nbill, we have recognized the importance of the tax deduction for \ncollege tuition, and the bill we are sending to conference extends it \nfor 4 additional years, through 2009. Unless extended by the 109th \nCongress, the deduction will not be available to taxpayers filing 2006 \nreturns. It is urgent that the provision be extended in this bill, so \nfamilies can plan for their kids' education.\n  The House bill, in sharp contrast with the bill that the Senate \npassed with 66 votes, extends this common-sense, middle-class tax \nrelief for only 1 year. Given that we face choices and budget \nlimitations, and we can't do it all, this motion instructs the Senate \nconferees to insist that the conference report should include the \nSenate-passed 4-year extension of the tuition deduction, rather than \nextending the tax cuts for dividends and capital gains that will not \nexpire for nearly 3 years.\n  That is the gist of my motion. We simply do not need to take action \non dividends and capital gains today, but on issues such as the college \ntuition deduction and the alternative minimum tax, Congress must act \nnow. If we can not do it all under the reconciliation limits, then the \ntax cuts for the middle class that have already expired should take \npriority.\n  The supply-siders who insist that cutting taxes for millionaires in \n2009 is more important than cutting taxes for middle-class families \nthis year argue that low tax rates on investments are central to our \neconomic well-being.\n  Like many of my colleagues, I agree that lower taxes are generally \npreferable to higher taxes. That is not a controversial position. The \nquestion is, when we have large budget deficits, what are our highest \npriorities?\n  We have to make choices. And in today's information-driven economy, a \ncollege degree is no longer a luxury, it is a necessity.\n  In terms of long-term economic growth and developing this country's \nhuman capital--which is ultimately the true source of innovation and \ncompetitive advantage--we could make few better investments than \nensuring that future generations have access to an affordable college \neducation.\n  And talk about a tax cut that pays for itself over time. According to \nthe Census Bureau, workers 18 and over with a bachelor's degree earn an \naverage of $51,206 a year, while those with a high school diploma earn \n$27,915, and the disparity has been growing over time. College \ngraduates make more money, and they will pay more in taxes as a result. \nMaking college easier to afford is a real investment, and you don't \nneed so-called dynamic scoring to make the case.\n  The challenge for American families is that the cost of college \ntuition has increased faster than any other major consumer item, \nincluding health care, over the last 20 years. It has skyrocketed from \n$5,156 in 1981 to $29,026 in 2005, an increase of 462 percent.\n  Even in real, inflation-adjusted dollars, the price of a 4-year \npublic or private college education has almost doubled over the past \ntwo decades.\n  While many of my colleagues talk about lower taxes on investment, \nwhen a family spends money on college tuition, they are investing too. \nThese families may not have a lot of money in taxable financial \ninvestments--more than three-quarters of U.S. households earn less than \n$1,000 in taxable income from investments, such as capital gains and \ndividends--but they are investing a lot in their kids' education.\n  In today's global, interconnected world, who is to say that these \ninvestments in human capital are not just as important, if not more so, \nthan the buying and selling of stocks?\n  I urge each of my colleagues to think about how quickly tuition costs \nare rising in their States and consider whether the majority of \ntaxpaying\n\n[[Page S1120]]\n\nfamilies in their States really need an extension of capital gains \nrelief or whether they really need relief from the AMT and college \ntuition costs.\n  Here are just a few examples from my State:\n  At Adelphi University on Long Island, tuition cost $5,114 in 1983 and \n$17,800 in 2003-2004, a more than three-fold increase.\n  At SUNY Purchase in Westchester County, tuition increased from $1,005 \nin 1980 to $4,079 in 2003-2004, or 4 times as much.\n  At Niagara University outside Buffalo, tuition has nearly quadrupled, \nfrom $3,300 in 1983 to $17,380 in 2003-2004.\n  I am sure each of us has similar stories to tell. I urge my \ncolleagues to support my motion, and keep the college tuition deduction \nin place for at least 4 more years.\n  The skyrocketing rise of college tuition is not the only trap \nensnaring an unsuspecting, and undeserving, American middle class. The \nindividual Alternative Minimum tax is another, and I would like to \nspeak for a moment on the motion to be offered by the minority leader.\n  Unless we act, the alternative minimum tax's crushing burden will be \nfelt by 17 million more middle- and upper-middle income taxpayers this \nyear than in 2005, and millions more in the years to come. AMT relief \nis a critical part of the Senate's version of this bill and we all must \ndo everything we can to ensure that this tax--which affects middle- and \nupper-middle class taxpayers--is addressed this year.\n  It would be nearly impossible to overstate the AMT issue in its \nimportance and urgency. By the end of the decade, the AMT will ensnare \nmore than 30 million taxpayers, the majority of which will have incomes \nbelow $100,000, and the National Taxpayer Advocate at the IRS has \nidentified the alternative minimum tax as the most serious problem \nfacing individual taxpayers.\n  Here are a few statistics I want to reinforce for my colleagues, \nwhich I mentioned on the floor earlier this month:\n  The year 2006 is the tipping point for the AMT, as the number of \ntaxpayers affected nationally will explode from 3.6 million to more \nthan 20 million, if the Congress fails to act;\n  A family with two children will become subject to the AMT at about \n$67,500 of income in 2006; and a family with five children will start \nowing AMT at about $54,000 of income this year, if the Congress fails \nto act;\n  In 2004, only 6.2 percent of families earning $100,000 to $200,000 a \nyear were subject to the AMT, and that number will explode to nearly 50 \npercent this year, if the Congress fails to act; and\n\n  Starting in 2008, the average married couple with two children \nearning $75,000 or more will find that more than half of the tax cuts \nthey have been expecting from the various laws passed since 2001 will \nbe taken back via the AMT, if the Congress fails to act.\n  If AMT relief is extended through 2006, about two-thirds of the \nbenefits will be realized by families earning under $200,000, with more \nthan half of the total benefits going to families with incomes between \n$100,000 and $200,000. In New York and many other States, particularly \nin or near major cities, a combined income of $100,000 or $150,000 does \nnot make you rich.\n  Contrast this with the tax relief for dividends and capital gains, \nwhere more than half of the total benefit goes to families with income \nover $1 million. This is more than 50 percent of the benefit going to \nless than one-half of one percent of all taxpayers in the country.\n  It was for these reasons that 73 Senators voted earlier this month to \nsupport a sense-of-the-Senate resolution that AMT relief should be a \nhigher priority for this Congress than a dividend and capital gains tax \ncut. The American people now expect us, and our conferees, to follow \nthrough on that pledge.\n  When you consider the statistics I mentioned, about who will become \nsubject to the AMT this year if we fail to act, it becomes pretty \nobvious that addressing the AMT problem--or extending the college \ntuition tax cut--should be far more important than extending a tax cut \non investment income that doesn't expire for nearly 3 more years. That \nis common sense, and it is an entirely separate question from who \nbenefits from which tax cut, or what your ideology may be.\n  In conclusion, we need a bill back from conference that mirrors the \nprevious Senate versions of reconciliation. We passed a bipartisan bill \nthat excluded the dividends and capital gains cuts and provided \ngenerous AMT relief for 2006. That bill passed the Senate with 64 \nvotes. Two weeks ago, a modified version of the bill received 66 votes. \nI strongly encourage our conferees to bring a similarly bipartisan bill \nback from conference.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, even though the hour of 8 is about to \narrive, I yield whatever time the Senator from Texas requires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, when the hour of 8 o'clock arrives, I \nask to be notified. I wish to speak on the motion made on my behalf by \nSenator Grassley earlier to instruct conferees to make the sales tax \ndeduction permanent.\n  This is very important to the States that have a sales tax but no \nincome tax. There are seven States that have no income tax. Yet the \ncitizens of all the other States of our country are able to deduct the \nincome taxes they pay at the State level from their Federal income \ntaxes. Two years ago, we enacted the law that would bring sales-tax \nStates into equity so that every State would be treated the same. We \nare now faced with another 2-year extension, or we will have this \ninequity continue because the sales tax deduction that was enacted by \nCongress lapsed at the end of last year. We have to make this deduction \npermanent.\n  I ask that our conferees be instructed to make it permanent so that \nevery person in America can deduct their State taxes, whatever kind of \ntax that may be, from their Federal income taxes. This is a matter of \nequity. It is only fair that sales-tax States be treated the same as \nincome-tax States.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote to make sales tax deductions permanent. \nGive people a choice. That is the right thing to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                      Motion to Instruct Conferees\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the vote now occurs \non the motion to instruct conferees offered by the Senator from Iowa, \nMr. Grassley, relating to veterans.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that 2 minutes be \nallocated to explaining these motions and that 2 minutes be equally \ndivided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I will yield my time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise for the purpose of asking \nunanimous consent to change the names of the sponsors of a motion that \nI filed.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Grassley motion regarding the \npermanence of the child tax credit be identified as Grassley for Talent \nand Snowe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Is there \nfurther debate?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: How long did that \nlast vote require?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Approximately 37 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Chair.\n  Let me briefly explain to my colleagues the distinction between the \nvote you just took and the motion I offer. Very simply put, it is \nwhether we are going to pay for the language we just adopted with the \nmotion of the chairman of the Finance Committee to have $19.9 billion \nfor veterans and then not provide the resources to achieve that goal. \nEveryone in this Chamber knows what will happen. That amendment will be \ndropped before this bill even gets out the door. If you adopt the \nmotion I offer, you will support taking the $19.9 billion out of the \n$64.8 billion that the House of Representatives proposes to spend on \nthe two-tenths of 1 percent of American taxpayers who make incomes of \nmore than $1 million a year. For that small amount, we can pay the \nveterans who desperately need the kind of services all of us know they \nneed. If you want to do something for the Grassley amendment, then \nadopt this motion which will provide the resources we have not adopted \nwith the Grassley provision.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the words ``paid for'' also mean tax \nincrease. The difference between these motions is, the Grassley motion \ndoes not contain the tax increase. The Dodd motion asks the conferees \nto raise taxes.\n  Mr. DODD.

Mr. President, today, I would briefly like to recount the \ndetails of a troubling series of events that resulted in the capture of \nfour Americans, one of whom was executed, in the jungles of Colombia. I \nrecently received word of this story from a special operations officer \nwith intimate knowledge of these and subsequent events.\n  Three years ago today, a contract surveillance plane operated by four \nAmerican Defense Department contractors and one Colombian military \nsergeant, was flying in support of our joint counternarcotics efforts \nin Colombia. Engine troubles forced the crew to crash land the aircraft \nin the Colombian jungle south of the capital Bogata.\n  While there was a small window of opportunity to mount a search and \nrescue effort, the launch of the rescue team was never authorized. All \nfive crew members were captured by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of \nColombia.\n  FARC is a known terrorist organization that has terrorized Colombian \ncivilians and political figures for decades. It has kidnapped and \nkilled numerous American citizens and poses a serious threat to U.S. \ninterests in Colombia. FARC is also very actively involved in drug \ntrafficking and extortion.\n  FARC immediately executed the lone Colombian serviceman and one of \nthe Americans and moved the other hostages farther south, deeper into \nthe Colombian jungle. In the 3 years since their abduction, there has \nbeen only one serious attempt to rescue the three remaining American \ncontractors. This took place in late August and early September of last \nyear.\n  Their names are Keith Stansell, Thomas Howes, and Marc Gonsalves. \nThese three Americans and their families here at home deserve more.\n  Our military, in coordination with its Colombian counterparts, needs \nto take more assertive action to rescue the captive Americans. In order \nto carry out this mission, American personnel on the ground need access \nto better, more reliable, and more actionable intelligence.\n  They have a better chance of uncovering the location and well-being \nof the hostages by increasing contacts with Colombian troops patrolling \nthe jungles and interrogating captured FARC members.\n  It is also important to seek tips from the local population that \nmight have information as to the whereabouts of these soldiers. But \nthere must be incentives for these civilians, who must also endure FARC \nviolence and intimidation, to come forward. For example, radio \nbroadcasts in the surrounding areas could inform local civilians of the \nsituation and offer rewards that the locals will truly value. Access to \nland and livestock could prove to be a great incentive for those with \nany information on the hostages to come forward.\n  We also need to increase our coordination with Colombian intelligence \npersonnel. They have the most intimate knowledge of their country and \nare likely to have more access to contacts with information. Greater \ncoordination and stronger links with these Colombian intelligence units \nwill give our military a better opportunity to act when relevant \ninformation becomes available.\n  For 3 years, three brave American civilian contractors have been held \nhostage by a ruthless terrorist organization deep in the Colombian \njungle. Though rescue attempts can be dangerous and entail numerous \nrisks to both the hostages and the rescuers, the failure to launch more \nthan one serious rescue attempt is a disservice to those men and to \ntheir families here at home. We can only imagine the anguish, \nuncertainty, and doubt they have endured for those 3 long years.\n  I urge the administration to redouble its efforts to rescue these \nthree Americans. A more assertive response is required. We owe it to \nthese men and to their families to make a more serious effort to rescue \nthem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/13/senate-section/article/S1122-3", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1122-S1124]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                      Lance Corporal Wesley Davids\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life of a brave \nyoung man, who was known for his incredible spirit and selflessness. \nMarine LCpl Wesley Davids, from Dublin, OH, was killed by an explosion \nin Iraq on May 11, 2005--exactly one day after his 20th birthday.\n  Ronald Reagan once said that ``some people spend an entire lifetime \nwondering if they've made a difference. The Marines don't have that \nproblem!'' Indeed, all of our U.S. Marines are making a difference each \nand every day, and Marine LCpl Wesley Davids was no exception.\n  Wesley was born to loving parents Michael and Jody Davids. Even from \nthe time he was a little boy, he loved anything that moved fast. When \nhe got older, he loved driving fast cars and fast boats. He owned a \nMustang GTS and two other cars. He also worked at a National Tire & \nBattery store on the North side of Columbus.\n  Wesley's friends at Dublin Scioto High School, from which he \ngraduated in 2003, describe him as having boundless energy and that \nbetween working on his cars and going off-roading, Wesley lived a very \nactive, very full life.\n  He loved a challenge and testing his own limits. Wesley was a stand-\nout member of his high school's crew team. According to his coach, Russ \nMerritt, ``Wesley was just a very impressive, strong young man. You \njust had no doubt that he would give 100 percent.''\n  Amy Speck, who rowed with Wesley, wrote the following about her \nteammate in a posting on an Internet tribute site dedicated to Wesley:\n\n       I had the privilege to be Wes's coxswain in his crew boat \n     his sophomore year and my senior year. Wes helped lead us to \n     winning the Midwest Championships. He always led by example \n     and was a fighter with a courageous spirit from the \n     beginning.\n\n  It was that courageous spirit and strong sense of leadership that \nprompted Wesley to join the Marine Corps after the September 11 \nterrorist attacks. His mother, though concerned about Wesley's safety, \ncame to accept his choice to enlist and respected the passion he \nbrought to his decision. Jody knew that her son's determination in this \npursuit was strong, and she was very proud of him.\n  She said that the same passion that defined Wesley in the boat when \nhe\n\n[[Page S1123]]\n\nrowed for the crew team, defined him as a Marine. ``He wanted the \ncamaraderie--the team spirit--of being part of something bigger than he \nwas.''\n  During their last phone conversation, Jody said that Wesley sounded \nvery happy and enthusiastic. She said, ``Wes, you sound really great. \nAre you having a good time?'' Wesley replied to his mother, ``I'm \nhaving a great time. I love the guys I'm serving with. I love what I'm \ndoing. We're really well-trained. The mission is worth it.''\n  One of Wesley's very good friends and high school classmates, Brian \nFry, addressed the crowd at Wesley's funeral. He greeted Wesley in a \nway that I am sure he would have loved. Brian said this:\n\n       Wes, we know you're in Heaven. And your Heaven is probably \n     one big mud pit! We'd just like to say, take a ride for us, \n     and we'll see you soon.\n\n  During the funeral, Wesley's Uncle Brian read a prayer he wrote \ntitled Twenty Years and a Day. He asked God to tell his nephew that he \nmissed and loved him and to thank him for the memories he left behind. \nBrian concluded the poem by saying:\n\n       Thank you for sending this wonderful gift to us--even if it \n     was for just 20 years and a day.\n\n  An Air Force chaplain who had known Wesley well read from a poem \ntitled Dash, which refers to the mark between the birth and death dates \non a tombstone:\n\n       He never made it to mid-dash. But he lived, and paid the \n     ultimate sacrifice for people he didn't even know. And, \n     that--that is love.\n\n  This past Veterans Day held special meaning for Wesley's family and \nfriends. As his mom Jody said:\n\n       Previously, Veterans Day was a day; it could just slip by \n     even though my dad is a veteran and my husband's father is a \n     veteran. This year, it has new and intense meaning for us.\n\n  She went on to say:\n\n       To stand up for what they believed in, to stand up for \n     their country, to show their love for their families and \n     their country and show pride to be an American citizen and do \n     something about it, we have to appreciate all of them for \n     that. While Wesley's death is a tragic loss, he died doing \n     something he felt passionately about. He was the best that \n     this country had to offer.\n\n  Wesley once said, ``I don't want to die, but I understand it is a \nresponsibility, and I'm willing to accept that risk.'' Wesley Davids \nwas a brave, model Marine. Did he make a difference in his all-too-\nbrief lifetime? Absolutely. He made a difference, and this statement \ndemonstrates a maturity level and selfless spirit well beyond his 20 \nyears and a day. As Reverend Charles Kuck said so well, ``Wesley Davids \nsaw more life than most of us see in an entire lifetime.''\n  Indeed, he did, Mr. President, indeed he did.\n  My wife Fran and I continue to keep Wesley's parents and his brother \nSteven in our thoughts and prayers.\n\n\n                 Private First Class Christopher Dixon\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life of a fellow Ohioan--\nMarine PFC Christopher Dixon--who was killed on May 11, 2005, when his \namphibious assault vehicle struck an explosive device while conducting \ncombat operations against enemy forces in Iraq. Christopher was only 18 \nyears old at the time of his death, making him the youngest service \nmember from Ohio to be killed in Iraq.\n  Franklin Delano Roosevelt, in paying tribute to the sacrifices young \nmen like Christopher Dixon make during times of war, said the \nfollowing:\n\n       In all of the operations of our Armed Forces, the toughest \n     job has been performed by the average easy-going, hard-\n     fighting young American who carries the weight of battle on \n     his own young shoulders. It is to him that we and all future \n     generations must pay grateful tribute.\n\n  And so today, I pay tribute to Christopher, a hard-fighting young \nAmerican, who carried the weight of battle on his own young shoulders.\n  Christopher--Chris to his family and friends--was a fun-loving young \nman, who took great joy in making others laugh. Friends remember Chris \nas both a daredevil and as a handsome ladies' man. Chris didn't have a \ngirlfriend, but his friends describe him as a charmer, with blue eyes \nand light brown hair that bleached to blonde in the summertime. His \nmother said that when it came to girls, ``He liked them all.''\n  Not afraid of anything, Chris was a true adventurer. He loved to \nfish, hunt, and ride his dirt bike, while standing on the seat, going \nfull speed into Wayne National Forest. An avid bowler, Chris would show \noff bowling tricks at Rainbow Lanes on South High Street in his \nhometown of Obetz, OH.\n  He worked in the bowling alley before joining the marines and liked \nto impress his friends by knocking down pins after facing backwards and \nrolling a ball through his legs. As friend Michele Hatfield remembers:\n\n       He'd do it just to show off. Anything to get a laugh out of \n     people.\n\n  Chris graduated from Hamilton Township High School in 2004, and \njoined the marines a week later. According to his mom, Chris dreamed of \nbecoming a marine since the start of high school. He was assigned to \nLima Company, which is part of the 3rd Battalion, 25th Marine Regiment \nout of Columbus. When he was sent to serve in Operation Iraqi Freedom, \nhis unit was attached to Regimental Combat Team 2, 2nd Marine Division, \n2nd Marine Expeditionary Force.\n  On May 22 of this year, I had the honor of meeting Chris Dixon's \nfamily and friends at the calling hours following his death. I saw \npictures of Chris and talked with his mom and his dad, Beckie and David \nDixon, and his older brother Chad. Beckie said that after she learned \nof Chris's death, she put up 18 flags, one for each year of his all too \nbrief life.\n  Chris's closely knit town of Obetz was devastated by the young \nmarine's death and the community grieved together. Allen Lantrip, 17 at \nthe time, said Chris was among the best the town had to offer. Chris \nwas one of the first people who welcomed Allen to Hamilton Township \nHigh School last year. The two talked before Chris departed for Iraq. \nAllen said Chris was very optimistic about going on the mission and \ncoming home safe.\n  Another friend, Jordan Wall, also said Chris never worried about the \npossibility of not coming home. She had known him for 7 years, as he \nhad lived one street over from her. Jordan said Chris wasn't scared at \nall and that he was happy to be in the marines. She said Chris was \nalways trying to help somebody. He knew he would be helping people in \nthe marines by serving his country.\n  At Chris's memorial service, Reverend William L. Snider said:\n\n       While Chris's death at such a young age is devastating, he \n     did not waste his youth and he died living his dream of \n     protecting his country as a marine. He gave his best for what \n     he believed in. He gave his best for the best.\n\n  Several of Chris's friends paid their respects to his life through \npostings on an Internet tribute site. Chris's friend Danielle from \nColumbus wrote the following:\n\n       Chris, my good friend, I miss you so, but I could not be \n     any more proud with how you lived your life. You are a true \n     hero, and now, my guardian angel. I will never forget all our \n     phone conversations and how beautiful that smile of yours \n     was. You lived out your dream and I know you are so happy \n     right now in heaven. I know I will see you again. Your mark \n     and your heart will be forever with me.\n\n  Chris Dixon epitomizes everything a good friend should be. People \nadored this young man and deeply respected his commitment to serving \nour country. He was a good person, a good person who loved what he was \ndoing and was proud to be helping to protect America and help rebuild \nthe lives of the people in Iraq.\n  I wish to conclude my remarks with something that Chris's friends \nDanielle and Nick from Obetz wrote in tribute to him:\n\n       Chris, you are someone who will be in our hearts forever. \n     We think of you daily and talk about our precious memories, \n     laughing about the crazy things you did. I'll always remember \n     going on double dates with you and your girlfriends, going to \n     the zoo, or trying to find a haunted house on my first date \n     with Nick. I am blessed that I got the pleasure of knowing \n     you. Spending the precious time you spent with Nick before \n     you left are some of the fondest memories he has of you, and \n     believe he, he couldn't be happier having all of those \n     memories--hanging out in the hot tub, playing pool and Ping-\n     Pong and, most of all, all the long talks. You were always \n     someone Nick could talk to no matter what it concerned and he \n     will never forget that.\n       We are proud of you. We knew you would do something great \n     with your life. You died for us at home so we could live free \n     and be safe. You made a sacrifice that no one will ever \n     forget. You are truly our hometown hero. We love you, Chris.\n\n  My wife Fran and I continue to keep Christopher Dixon's family in our \nthoughts and in our prayers.\n\n[[Page S1124]]\n\n                      lieutenant commander wittwer\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to honor the memory of the late \nLCDR Frank Carl Wittwer. Lieutenant Commander Wittwer, a longtime \nHanford resident, perished when his F/A-18C Hornet went down during a \ntraining mission near Naval Air Facility El Centro on January 18, 2006. \nHe was 35 years old.\n  A 1994 graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy, Lieutenant Commander \nWittwer was fondly remembered as a friendly and active student who \nparticipated in a number of activities such as music and youth \nministries at his church. Upon receiving his bachelor of science degree \nin systems engineering, he began his successful active-duty career as a \nsurface warfare officer aboard the USS California and the USS McFaul.\n  In recognition of his considerable talents, Lieutenant Commander \nWittwer was assigned to the Hornet Program with VFA-137 in 2001. \nSubsequently, he received postings at Strike Fighter Wing Pacific Fleet \nas safety officer and a follow-on assignment with the VFA-97 Warhawks. \nThroughout his years of service, Lieutenant Commander Wittwer was known \nas a dedicated and honorable serviceman who embodied the best qualities \nand ideals of the U.S. Navy.\n  In his personal life, Lieutenant Commander Wittwer demonstrated a \ngenuine commitment to improving the lives of others.

Mr. President, I will to take a moment to speak about \nH.R. 32, the Stop Counterfeiting in Manufactured Goods Act of 2005, \nsponsored by Representative Knollenberg and 59 House cosponsors. The \ncounterfeiting of goods bearing American held trademarks is an \nimportant problem that I am committed to fighting, as reflected by my \nsponsoring S. 1699, the Senate companion bill to H.R. 32, earlier this \nyear with Senator Leahy and Senators Alexander, Bayh, Brownback, \nCoburn, Cornyn, DeWine, Durbin, Feingold, Feinstein, Hatch, Kyl, Levin, \nReed, Stabenow, and Voinovich.\n  H.R. 32, the Stop Counterfeiting in Manufactured Goods Act of 2005, \naddresses a problem that has reached epidemic proportions as a result \nof a loophole in our Criminal Code: the trafficking in counterfeit \nlabels. Criminal law currently prohibits the trafficking in counterfeit \ntrademarks ``on or in connection with goods or services.'' However, it \ndoes not prohibit the trafficking in the counterfeit marks themselves. \nAs such, there is nothing in current law to prohibit an individual from \nselling counterfeit labels bearing otherwise protected trademarks \nwithin the United States.\n  This loophole was exposed by the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals in \nUnited States v. Giles, 213 F.3d 1247, 10th Cir. 2000. In this case, \nthe United States prosecuted the defendant for manufacturing and \nselling counterfeit Dooney & Bourke labels that third parties could \nlater affix to generic purses. Examining title 18, section 2320, of the \nUnited States Code, the Tenth Circuit held that persons who sell \ncounterfeit trademarks that are not actually attached to any ``goods or \nservices'' do not violate the Federal criminal trademark infringement \nstatute. Since the defendant did not attach counterfeit the marks to \n``goods or services,'' the court found that the defendant did not run \nafoul of the criminal statute as a matter of law. Thus, someone caught \nredhanded with counterfeit trademarks walked free.\n  H.R. 32 closes this loophole by amending title 18, section 2320 of \nthe United States Code to criminally prohibit the trafficking, or \nattempt to traffic, in ``labels, patches, stickers'' and generally any \nitem to which a counterfeit mark has been applied. In so doing, H.R. 32 \nprovides U.S. Department of Justice prosecutors with the means not only \nto prosecute individuals trafficking in counterfeit goods or services \nbut also individuals trafficking in labels, patches, and the like that \nare later applied to goods.\n  Congress must act expeditiously to protect U.S. held trademarks to \nthe fullest extent of the law. The recent 10- count indictment of 4 \nMassachusetts residents of conspiracy to traffic in approximately $1.4 \nmillion of counterfeit luxury goods in the case of U.S. v. Luong et \nal., 2005 D. Mass., underscores the need for this legislation. \nAccording to the indictment, law enforcement officers raided self-\nstorage units earlier this year and found the units to hold \napproximately 12,231 counterfeit handbags; 7,651 counterfeit wallets; \nmore than 17,000 generic handbags and wallets; and enough counterfeit \nlabels and medallions to turn more than 50,000 generic handbags and \nwallets into counterfeits. Although the U.S. Attorney's Office was able \nto pursue charges of trafficking and attempting to traffic in \ncounterfeit handbags and wallets, they could not able to bring charges \nfor trafficking and attempting to traffic in the more than 50,000 \ncounterfeit labels and medallions. As such, these defendants will \nescape prosecution that would have otherwise been illegal if they had \nonly been attached to an otherwise generic bag. This simply does not \nmake sense and had the Stop Counterfeiting in Manufactured Goods Act of \n2005 been in effect at the time of indictment, U.S. prosecutors would \nhave been able to bring charges against the defendants for trafficking \nand attempting to traffic in not only counterfeit goods but also \ncounterfeit labels.\n  As Assistant Attorney General Alice Fisher said, ``Those who \nmanufacture and sell counterfeit goods steal business from honest \nmerchants, confuse or defraud honest consumers, and illegally profit on \nthe backs of honest American workers and entrepreneurs.'' This point is \nunderscored by the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection estimate \nthat trafficking in counterfeit goods costs the United States \napproximately $200-$250 million annually. With each passing year, the \nUnited States loses millions of dollars in tax revenues to the sale of \ncounterfeit goods. Further, each counterfeit item that is manufactured \noverseas and distributed in the United States costs American workers \ntens of thousands of jobs. With counterfeit goods making up a growing 5 \nto 7 percent of world trade, this is a problem that we can no longer \nignore.\n  To be sure, counterfeiting is not limited to the popular designer \ngoods that we have all seen sold on corners of just about every major \nmetropolitan city in the United States. Counterfeiting has a \ndevastating impact on a broad range of industries. In fact, for almost \nevery legitimate product manufactured and sold within the United \nStates, there is a parallel counterfeit product being sold for no more \nthan half the price. These counterfeit products range from children's \ntoys to clothing to Christmas tree lights. More frightening are the \nthousands of counterfeit automobile parts, batteries, and electrical \nequipment that are being manufactured and placed into the stream of \ncommerce with each passing day. I am told that the level of \nsophistication in counterfeiting has reached the point that you can no \nlonger distinguish between the real and the counterfeit good or label \nwith the naked eye. However, just because these products look the same \ndoes not mean that they have the same quality characteristics. The \ncounterfeit products are not subject to the same quality controls of \nlegitimate products, resulting in items that are lower in quality and \nlikely to fall apart. In fact, counterfeit products could potentially \nkill unsuspecting American consumers.\n  In addition to closing the ``counterfeit label loophole,'' the Stop \nCounterfeiting in Manufactured Goods Act strengthens the Criminal Code \nand provides heightened penalties for those trafficking in counterfeit \nmarks. Current law does not provide for the seizure and forfeiture of \ncounterfeit trademarks, whether they are attached to\n\n[[Page S1125]]\n\ngoods or not. Therefore, many times such counterfeit goods are seized \none day, only to be returned and sold to an unsuspecting public. To \nensure that individuals engaging in the practice of trafficking in \ncounterfeit marks cannot reopen their doors, H.R. 32 establishes \nprocedures for the mandatory seizure, forfeiture, and destruction of \ncounterfeit marks prior to a conviction. Further, it provides for \nprocedures for the mandatory forfeiture and destruction of property \nderived from or used to engage in the trafficking of counterfeit marks.\n\n  When this legislation was sent over to the Senate from the House, \nconcerns were raised to Senator Leahy and myself about the language in \nSection 2(b)(1)(B) of this bill pertaining to the forfeiture authority \nof the U.S. Department of Justice. In focusing our attention to this \nsection, we discussed the scope of the facilitation language, which \nparallels the drug and money laundering forfeiture language in 21 \nU.S.C. 853 and 18 U.S.C. 982, respectively, and how it might relate to \nInternet marketplace companies, search engines, and ISPs. Specifically, \nwe were aware of concerns regarding the potential misapplication of the \nfacilitation language in section 2(b)(1)(B) to pursue forfeiture and \nseizure proceedings against responsible Internet marketplace companies \nthat serve as third party intermediaries to online transactions.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Section 2(b)(1)(B) authorizes U.S. attorneys to pursue \ncivil in rem forfeiture proceedings against ``any property used, in any \nmanner or part, to commit or to facilitate the commission of a \nviolation of subsection (a).'' The intent of this language is to \nprovide attorneys and prosecutors with the authority to bring a civil \nforfeiture action against the property of bad actors who are \nfacilitating trafficking or attempts to traffic in counterfeit marks. \nThe forfeiture authority in section 2(b)(1)(B) cannot be used to pursue \nforfeiture and seizure proceedings against the computer equipment, Web \nsite, or network of responsible Internet marketplace companies, which \nserve solely as a third-party to transactions and do not tailor their \nservices or their facilities to the furtherance of trafficking or \nattempts to traffic in counterfeit marks. However, these Internet \nmarketplace companies must make demonstrable good faith efforts to \ncombat the use of their systems and services to traffic in counterfeit \nmarks. Companies must establish and implement procedures to take down \npostings that contain or offer to sell goods, services, labels, and the \nlike in violation of this act upon being made aware of the illegal \nnature of these items or services.\n  It is the irresponsible culprits that must be held accountable. Those \nwho profit from another's innovation have proved their creativity only \nat escaping responsibility for their actions. As legislators, it is \nimportant that we provide law enforcement with the tools needed to \ncapture these thieves.\n  Senator Specter, it is also my understanding that the U.S. Sentencing \nCommission recently promulgated new Federal sentencing guidelines to \naccount for the changes in how intellectual property crimes are \ncommitted. Could you clarify for the record why we have authorized the \nU.S. Sentencing Commission to further amend the Federal sentencing \nguidelines and policy statements for crimes committed in violation of \ntitle 18, section 2318 or 2320, of the United States Code?\n  Mr. SPECTER. As Senator Leahy is aware, periodically the Sentencing \nCommission has sought to update the Federal sentencing guidelines upon \nthe periodic directive of Congress to reflect and account for changes \nin the manner in which intellectual property offenses are committed. \nThe recent amendments to which you refer were promulgated by the \nSentencing Commission pursuant to the authorization in the Family \nEntertainment and Copyright Act of 2005, also known as FECA. These \namendments to the Federal sentencing guidelines, which took effect on \nOctober 24, 2005, address changes in penalties and definitions for \nintellectual property rights crimes, particularly those involving \ncopyrighted prerelease works and issues surrounding ``uploading.'' For \nexample, these guidelines provide for a 25 percent increase in \nsentences for offenses involving prerelease works. In addition, the \nCommission revised its definition of ``uploading'' to ensure that the \nguidelines are keeping up with technological advances in this area.\n  I would like to make it clear for the record that the directive to \nthe Sentencing Commission in section 3 of H.R. 32 is not meant as \ndisapproval of the Commission's recent actions in response to FECA. \nRather, section 3 covers other intellectual property rights crimes that \nCongress believes it is time for the Commission to revisit. \nSpecifically, section 3 directs the Commission to review the \nguidelines, and particularly the definition of ``infringement amount,'' \nto ensure that offenses involving low-cost items like labels, patches, \nmedallions, or packaging that are used to make counterfeit goods that \nare much more expensive are properly punished. It also directs the \nCommission to ensure that the penalty provisions for offenses involving \nall counterfeit goods or services or devices used to facilitate \ncounterfeiting are properly addressed by the guidelines. As it did in \nresponse to the No Electronic Theft Act of 1997 and FECA, I am \nconfident that the Commission will ensure that the Federal sentencing \nguidelines provide adequate punishment and deterrence for these very \nserious offenses, and I look forward to the Commission's response to \nthis directive.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Senator Specter, thank you for that clarification. As you \nare aware, there has been overwhelming support for this legislation. It \nhas been very heartening to see such overwhelming support for this \nimportant bill. Counterfeiting is a threat to America. It wreaks real \nharm on our economy, our workers, and our consumers. This bill is a \ntough bill that will give law enforcement improved tools to fight this \nform of theft. The bill is short and straightforward, but its impact \nshould be profound and far-reaching.\n  Mr. SPECTER. At this point, I would like to take this opportunity to \nthank like to thank Representative Jim Sensenbrenner, Chairman of the \nHouse Judiciary Committee, and Representative Joe Knollenberg for their \nleadership in the House with regard to H.R. 32. In January of 2005, \nRepresentative Knollenberg introduced H.R. 32 in the House. When the \nbill was in Committee, he fostered negotiations between the Department \nof Justice, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the International \nTrademark Association to ensure that it passed the House. I would also \nlike to thank my colleague Senator Leahy, ranking member of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, and Senators Alexander, Bayh, Brownback, Coburn, \nCornyn, DeWine, Durbin, Feingold, Feinstein, Hatch, Kyl, Levin, Reed, \nStabenow, and Voinovich for their cosponsorship of S. 1699, the \ncompanion legislation to H.R. 32. It is through the hard work of all of \nthese Members that we were able to achieve truly bipartisan support for \nlanguage that will ensure the protection of American-held trademarks.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Some of our most important legislation is produced not \nonly when we reach across the aisle in the name of bipartisanship but \nwhen we work across chambers and reach true consensus. I would also \nlike to thank Senators Alexander, Bayh, Brownback, Coburn, Cornyn, \nDeWine, Durbin, Feingold, Feinstein, Hatch, Kyl, Levin, Reed, Stabenow \nand Voinovich for their cosponsorship of the Senate companion \nlegislation. Counterfeiting is a serious problem that does not lend \nitself to a quick and easy solution. This legislation is an important \nstep toward fighting counterfeiting. I hope we can build on the success \nof this law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/13/senate-section/article/S1125-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1125-S1126]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      PRINCIPLES OF TELECOM REFORM\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, when the last major \ntelecommunications bill was passed in 1996, fewer than half of American \nhouseholds owned a computer, only one out of four owned a cell phone or \nhad Internet access, almost no one had residential broadband Internet \naccess, and Internet commerce was in its infancy. Regulations were \nbased on the assumption that telephone networks only offered voice \nservice, cable television networks only offered video service, and the \nInternet only offered data service. Today, however, many cable systems \noffer Internet access and phone service,\n\n[[Page S1126]]\n\ntelephone networks support Internet access and will soon offer video, \nand the Internet supports an amazing variety of applications.\n  I believe reform to our telecommunications laws is needed, and we \nshould make reform a priority. It is time to tear down regulatory \nbarriers between telephone, wireless, video, and the Internet to \nunleash innovation and encourage private investment.\n  I applaud the leadership of Senators Stevens and Inouye on the Senate \nCommerce Committee in scheduling an ambitious slate of hearings to \naddress telecom reform. As the hearings begin, I want to outline some \nbasic principles I would like to see embodied in any reform legislation \nthat moves forward out of committee.\n  In order to tap the infinite potential technology has to improve the \nway we communicate, I believe we should do the following:\n  No. 1, eliminate regulatory barriers that hinder innovation and \nencourage private investment in new telecommunications facilities and \nservices; No. 2, streamline video franchising requirements to \nfacilitate greater consumer choice of video providers, while allowing \nmunicipalities to protect community interests; No. 3, encourage a \nfavorable regulatory environment for robust competition among \ncommunications providers, while protecting consumers' access to content \nand services; No. 4, allow for the development of uniform consumer \nprotection standards, while recognizing the importance of State and \nlocal regulators in addressing consumer concerns; and No. 5, use the \npublic spectrum to promote development of new wireless communications \nservices such as broadband Internet.\n  Any telecom reform must address the needs of every American consumer \nregardless of where they live. Rural areas like Nebraska cannot be left \nbehind. I believe that technology holds enormous economic promise to \nrural America, and innovation and competition must be encouraged in \neven the most remote areas of our country. Therefore I advocate that \nreform legislation do the following:\n  No. 1, ensure the stability of the Universal Service Fund in order to \npreserve affordable telephone service in rural areas, and for all \nAmericans, as well as to continue support for schools, libraries and \nrural health care providers; No. 2, promote private investment in and \ndeployment of broadband Internet and other advanced telecommunications \nservices, in rural America; and No. 3, encourage increased wireless \ncoverage and introduction of new wireless services to rural America.\n  In order for the United States to be a leader in the global economy, \nwe must modernize our telecommunications laws to ensure we are \nfostering investment, innovation, and competition and not impeding \nprogress. We also must ensure that everyone--regardless of where they \nlive--benefits from modernization of our telecom laws.\n  I believe we must act now to protect our place in the world as a \nleader in communications, and I look forward to the debate on this very \nimportant issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/13/senate-section/article/S1126-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1126]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CELEBRATING BLACK HISTORY MONTH\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this year, as we celebrate Black History \nMonth, we also mourn the loss of two great civil rights leaders: Rosa \nParks and Coretta Scott King.\n  These women were both pivotal figures in the civil rights movement, \nleaders who inspired all of us with their commitment, their dignity, \nand their incredible courage.\n  Both dedicated their lives to the cause of freedom--to ridding the \nSouth of the cruelty of segregation and ridding our society of the \nscourge of racism.\n  Both lived to see tremendous progress in America and both lived to \nsee how much is still left undone.\n  As we mourn the passing of these heroic figures of the civil rights \nmovement, we must ensure that the cause of justice for which they \nworked so hard, and sacrificed so much--marches on.\n  As we mourn these great leaders, and celebrate their lives, we must \nalso ask ourselves what we can do to honor the contributions they made, \nand the way they worked to transform our Nation. I am reminded of \nsomething Rosa Parks once said about Dr. King. She was concerned that, \nwhile the birthday of Dr. King had become a national holiday, he was \nbeing depicted as merely, ``a dreamer.'' As I remember him,'' she said, \n``he was more than a dreamer. He was an activist who believed in acting \nas well as speaking out against oppression.''\n  Once again, Rosa Parks was right: It is not only Dr. King's dream \nthat endures, although it does endure, and has given strength to so \nmany. It is the actions of Dr. King, and Coretta Scott King, and Rosa \nParks, and the actions of so many millions of others, that have brought \nus forward in an inexorable march to freedom.\n  Dr. King said it himself, in a different way, when he spoke about the \nMontgomery Bus Boycott: ``We came to see that, in the long run, it is \nmore honorable to walk in dignity than ride in humiliation. So, in a \nquite dignified manner, we decided to substitute tired feet for tired \nsouls, and walk the streets of Montgomery.''\n  They met injustice with action. They walked in dignity, for 381 days, \nuntil they met with victory. And today we, too, must move forward on \nthe civil rights issues that press us to action--on racial profiling, \non voting rights, on the death penalty; and also on access to good \neducation and good health care, on addressing the HIV/AIDS crisis, and \nall the issues where inequality still plagues our Nation.\n  Dr. King, Coretta Scott King, Rosa Parks--they, and so many others, \nwould rather have tired feet than tired souls, and so must we.\n  During Black History Month, as we pay tribute to their \naccomplishments, and as we rededicate ourselves to the goals we have \nyet to achieve, we know that those great Americans would never be \ncomplacent, would never tire, would never be satisfied with anything \nless than justice. And neither must anyone in this body, or in this \ncountry.\n  We must commit to walk on together in that march for equality in this \ncountry, and justice in this world, resolving that we, too, may have \ntired feet but never a tired soul.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/13/senate-section/article/S1126-2", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1126-S1127]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        TRIBUTE TO PACCAR, INC.\n\n Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate a great \nAmerican innovator.\n  It is a special pleasure to recognize an exceptional company which \ntoday has earned the prestigious National Medal of Technology, the \nhighest honor given in our Nation for technological innovation. PACCAR \nIncorporated is a model of success and a Washington State institution. \nIn 2005, the company celebrated its 100th year in business. You might \nnot recognize the PACCAR name, but perhaps you have heard of some of \nPACCAR's finest brands: Kenworth and Peterbilt trucks.\n  PACCAR is one of our Nation's top truck manufacturers and today they \nare cited for: ``pioneering efforts and industry leadership in the \ndevelopment and commercialization of aerodynamic, lightweight trucks \nthat have dramatically reduced fuel consumption and increased the \nproductivity of U.S. freight transportation.''\n  This National Medal is a distinct honor bestowed by the President \nsince 1985. It was first mandated by Congress in 1980, established to \nrecognize the significant contributions that America's leading \ninnovators have made to the Nation's economic strength and standard of \nliving. The award is given annually to individuals, teams, and/or \ncompanies or divisions whose work has made a lasting impact on our \nlives through the development and commercialization of groundbreaking \ntechnology in our Nation.\n  Past recipients include leaders in our Nation's cutting-edge science \nand high-tech communities--companies such as Dow, Dupont, and Corning \nor individuals such as those who have performed the first human heart \ntransplant and invented the first whole-body CT scanner. The National \nMedal serves to honor the legacy of innovation that has made our Nation \na technological leader for more than two centuries. And it seeks also \nto inspire the future generations of innovators who will keep our \nNation strong for years to come.\n\n[[Page S1127]]\n\n  This year, PACCAR, a Bellevue, WA company has earned this special \nrecognition. But what, you may ask, do a lot of big rigs have to do \nwith science and innovation?\n  Well, PACCAR has time and again led the industry in the design and \nmanufacture of fuel efficient and lightweight trucks. They were the \nfirst to use a diesel engine in a heavy-duty truck. They were the first \nto introduce a truly aerodynamic truck design. And they were the first \nto use lightweight composites and aluminum in truck suspensions on a \nlarge scale. It would be difficult to name a single innovation in the \nrecent history of truck design without finding a PACCAR product at its \nfoundation.\n  These advances have required both significant investment and no small \namount of risk. But PACCAR's faith has paid serious dividends to the \ntruck buyer, the consumer, the economy, and the environment. For too \nlong, heavy-duty trucks couldn't improve beyond a weak 10-mile-per-\ngallon fuel efficiency ceiling. But today, thanks to Peterbilt's and \nKenworth's transformation, they have soared above and beyond that mark, \nsignificantly altering the economic and environmental forces at play in \nthe market.\n  PACCAR's example has shown that it makes sense to support and advance \nfuel efficient technology, not only to protect our precious natural \nresources and reduce our dangerous reliance on foreign oil but also to \nhelp our economy thrive and grow. We would be wise to note PACCAR's \nmodel as we develop a comprehensive strategy for thoughtful investment \nin our energy future.\n  Day and night in all 50 States, PACCAR's trucks travel our Nation's \nhighways--roads that have no end, constantly curving, folding and \nmerging into one another. In our complex world of commerce and the vast \ntransportation system on which that world relies, change is great and \ninevitable. PACCAR recognizes this beautiful evolution, embraces it, \nand seizes the opportunities it creates.\n  I rise to congratulate PACCAR Incorporated. It has made Washington \nState proud, it has made our Nation strong. The National Medal of \nTechnology they receive today is well deserved.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/13/senate-section/article/S1127-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1127]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE SAN FRANCISCO EARTHQUAKE AND FIRE: IN \n                             COMMEMORATION\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to recognize the 100th \nanniversary of one of the most significant disasters in California \nhistory, San Francisco's Great Earthquake and Fire of 1906.\n  One hundred years ago, the city of San Francisco experienced this \nhorrific tragedy when the city shook for almost 60 seconds and \ncommunities from as far away as Oregon, Los Angeles, and Nevada felt \nthe tremors. The Richter scale was not yet in existence in 1906, but \nseismologists today estimate this earthquake had a magnitude of 7.7 to \n8.0.\n  Following the earthquake, fires broke out across the city and raged \nfor 3 days. In fact, the fires did more damage than the earthquake. As \na result of this disaster, over 3,000 people were killed, 300,000 \npeople became homeless, and the city suffered about $500 million worth \nof damage. Telegraph and telephone services were destroyed as well as \nthe municipal railway and all government buildings.\n  The 100th anniversary of this historic tragedy provides an \nopportunity to reflect on what we have learned and how to better \nprepare for a similar event. We now know that residents must be \nprepared to be self-sufficient for 72 hours following a disaster. And \nthe city of San Francisco has done a great deal to make the community \nsafer.\n  San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom has spearheaded an updated citywide \nemergency plan--the first time it has been done in 10 years. The San \nFrancisco Fire Department offers training in disaster and emergency \nresponse for residents. Over 11,000 San Francisco residents have \ncompleted the course in the past 15 years. San Francisco has also \ninvested $2.5 million in leading the development of a regional response \nplan with seven other bay area counties. This is one of the first \nregional response plans in the country. I commend the city and county \nof San Francisco on its efforts to ensure the city is ready to respond \nto a disaster.\n  Having witnessed the slow response to Hurricane Katrina in the Gulf \nStates, I wrote to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, in \nSeptember asking for a copy of their disaster response plan for a \nserious earthquake in California. I am still waiting to receive their \nplan. Without the plan in hand, I remain very concerned that FEMA is \nnot prepared should a major earthquake or natural disaster occur in \nCalifornia.\n  It is very important that the State of California and its residents \nare working to prepare themselves for a major disaster. I have created \na ``Getting Ready'' guide on my Senate Web site to help my constituents \nprepare their homes and families for a disaster. This guide is \norganized in easy-to-follow steps and provides links to other \npreparedness sites--www.boxer.senate.gov/equake.cfm.\n  On the 100th anniversary of the Great San Francisco Earthquake and \nFire, I rise to honor the memory of those who lost their lives during \nthis disaster. I also pause to reflect on the tragedy that befell this \ngreat city and its citizens. The community came together to repair and \nrestore the city, and today, San Francisco is one of the United States' \ntop tourist destinations and a dynamic urban center.\n  I also commemorate this anniversary by encouraging all of us to look \nforward and ensure our families are prepared for a major earthquake or \nsimilar disaster. I will continue fighting to ensure the Federal \nGovernment is taking the steps necessary to help our local communities \nin disaster response.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/13/senate-section/article/S1127-2", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1127]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/13/senate-section/article/S1127-3", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1127]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/13/senate-section/article/S1127-4", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1127-S1128]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n ECONOMIC REPORT OF THE PRESIDENT DATED FEBRUARY 2006 WITH THE ANNUAL \n       REPORT OF THE COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS FOR 2006--PM 39\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Joint Economic Committee:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  The United States economy continues to demonstrate remarkable \nresilience, flexibility, and growth. Having previously endured a stock \nmarket collapse, recession, terrorist attacks, and corporate scandals, \nthis year the economy showed strong growth and robust job creation in \nthe face of higher energy prices and devastating natural disasters. \nThis is the result of the hard work of America's workers, supported by \npro-growth tax policies.\n  In 2005, the Nation's real gross domestic product (GDP) grew 3.5 \npercent for the year, above the historical average. About 2 million \npayroll jobs were added in 2005, and the unemployment rate dropped to \n4.7 percent last month, well below the averages of the 1970s, 1980s, \nand 1990s. Real disposable personal income increased, and real \nhousehold net worth reached an all-time high. This growth comes on top \nof an already strong expansion. More than 4.7 million payroll jobs have \nbeen added since August 2003.\n  Compared with the performance of other nations' economies, our \neconomic growth is especially impressive. The United States has added \nmore jobs in the past two-and-a-half years than Japan and the European \nUnion combined. Real GDP growth in the United States has been faster \nthan in any other major industrialized country since 2001, and America \nis forecasted to continue as the fastest-growing country over the next \ntwo years.\n  Our economy's fundamental strength comes from the ingenuity and hard \nwork of our workers. Productivity--how much workers produce per hour--\n\n[[Page S1128]]\n\nhas accelerated since 2000. In the past five years, productivity has \ngrown faster than in any other five-year period since the mid-1960s. \nThe productivity of the United States is increasing faster than any \nother major industrialized country.\n  Productivity growth raises our standard of living and plays a central \nrole in our competitiveness in the worldwide economy. Productivity \ngrowth will be even more important as new technologies accelerate \nglobal economic integration and as the American population ages.\n  We must now build on this fundamental strength by making robust \ninvestments in physical sciences, improving private incentives for \nresearch and development, and boosting math and science education and \nworker training. The American Competitiveness Initiative will help us \nremain a world leader in science and technology, which means good high-\npaying jobs for the American people.\n  We must also continue to pursue pro-growth economic policies and \nfoster a culture of entrepreneurship. To adopt innovations effectively, \nour companies and workers need the incentives and flexibility that \nsupport a thriving free-market economy.\n  Maintaining a low tax burden is essential for our economic growth and \ncompetitiveness. Tax relief has helped our economy, and raising taxes \nwill increase the burden on our families and small businesses. To keep \nour economy growing, Congress needs to make the tax relief permanent.\n  Two years ago, I called for cutting the budget deficit in half by \n2009 by restraining spending and spurring economic growth. Every year \nof my presidency, we have reduced the growth of non-security \ndiscretionary spending, and last year Congress passed bills that cut \nthis spending. This year, my budget will cut it again, and it will \nreduce or eliminate more than 140 programs that are performing poorly \nor not fulfilling essential priorities. By passing these reforms, we \nwill save the American taxpayer another $14 billion next year, and we \nwill stay on track to cut the deficit in half by 2009.\n  Controlling discretionary spending alone is not enough, however. We \nhave recently passed significant savings in mandatory spending \nprograms. We need to do more because the only way to solve our Nation's \nfiscal challenges is to address the explosions in growth of entitlement \nprograms like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. I have called \nfor a bipartisan commission to examine the full impact of the Baby Boom \nretirement and help us come up with bipartisan answers. The longer \nCongress waits to act, the more difficult the choices will become.\n  Working together, we accomplished other significant pro-growth \nreforms that will help our Nation's economy grow stronger and create \nmore jobs. More remains to be done.\n  Growth in spending on health care has been more rapid than general \ninflation, straining consumers, employers, and government budgets. Two \nyears ago, we created Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) to help give \npatients more control over their health care decisions and to make \nhealth care more available and affordable. This year, I am proposing to \nenhance HSAs to make them more widely available, valuable to consumers, \nand attractive to small businesses--and to make it easier for people to \nkeep their insurance policies when they change jobs. Last year, we \nworked with Congress to pass a patient safety bill that will help \nreduce medical errors. Getting doctors and patients the information \nthey need on the quality, cost, and effectiveness of different \ntreatments will help Americans get the highest quality and highest \nvalue care. This year, my Administration will push to make more \ninformation about price and quality available to consumers, and move \nforward on these and other policies to lower the cost of health care.\n  Our Nation's liability laws allow too many frivolous lawsuits and \nraise costs for consumers and businesses. A year ago, we worked with \nCongress to pass bipartisan class action reform to help curb lawsuit \nabuse. I urge Congress in the coming year to pass other essential legal \nreforms, including asbestos and medical liability reforms.\n  Energy prices have risen in the last year, but the underlying causes \nof high prices are long-standing. Last year, we passed the first major \nenergy bill in over a decade. It encourages new technologies and \nupdates government regulations. Over time, the new law will help \nincrease the reliability of our energy supply and the efficient use of \nthe energy we have. We must continue to find new ways to diversify our \nsources of energy. I have proposed the Advanced Energy Initiative to \nhelp increase research in alternative energy sources and technology and \nto make America less dependent on foreign sources of energy.\n  Because 95 percent of the world's customers live outside of our \nborders, opening international markets to our goods and services is \ncritical for our economy. My Administration will continue to work \ntirelessly to open markets and knock down barriers to free and fair \ntrade so that American farmers and workers can compete on a level \nplaying field worldwide.\n  These and other issues are discussed in the 2006 Annual Report of the \nCouncil of Economic Advisers. This report is prepared by CEA to help \npolicymakers understand the economic context of a variety of issues and \ntrends as our Government makes decisions regarding our economic future. \nBy adopting sound economic policies that build on our strengths, we \nwill keep our economy moving forward and extend prosperity for all \nAmericans.\n                                                      George W.

A bill to promote accountability and prevent fraud in \nFederal contracting; to the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this week marks five months since \nPresident Bush stood in Jackson Square in New Orleans and promised, \n``Throughout the area hit by the hurricane, we will do what it takes, \nwe will stay as long as it takes, to help citizens rebuild their \ncommunities and their lives.''\n  America must keep that promise, and we must do so responsibly. So \ntoday, I am introducing a proposal to ensure that from here on out, \nfederal reconstruction dollars needed to rebuild the Katrina-ravaged \nGulf Coast--and Iraq--are not awarded to companies with histories of \ncheating American taxpayers.\n  My bill, the Reconstruction Accountability and Anti-Fraud Act, will \npromote accountability and prevent fraud in two of the largest \nreconstruction projects ever undertaken by the United States.\n  Under my proposal, firms that have cheated American taxpayers by \novercharging, improperly billing or defrauding the government of more \nthan $10 million over the last five years will be ineligible to compete \nfor reconstruction work in either the Gulf Coast or Iraq.\n  Katrina is a national tragedy and rebuilding Iraq is a national \nresponsibility, and neither should be an opportunity for profiteering.\n  Firms that have misused Iraq construction funds should be held \naccountable--not rewarded with no-bid contracts to rebuild the Gulf \nCoast.\n  Sadly, we've already seen examples of just that sort of misuse of \ntaxpayer dollars.\n  New Orleans were still waist-deep in flood waters when Halliburton \nand its subsidiary, Kellogg, Brown & Root, were awarded some of the \nfirst multi-billion dollar no-bid contracts for Katrina reconstruction \nwork. The companies received those contracts despite repeatedly \novercharging the government for work in Iraq.\n  Listen to these abuses: In 2004, Halliburton was found to have \novercharged the Defense Department by $167 million to import gasoline \ninto Iraq from Kuwait.\n  A year later, a Pentagon audit revealed another $108 million in \novercharges by KBR, a Halliburton subsidiary, for delivering gasoline \nto Iraq.\n  In 2003, KBR overcharged the government $27.4 million over 9 months \nfor meals at five military bases in Iraq and Kuwait, where they billed \nthe government for an average of 42,000 meals a day but served only \n14,000 meals a day.\n  Last month, former KBR employees testified at a Senate Democratic \nPolicy Committee hearing that water provided by KBR to thousands of \nU.S. troops in Iraq contained twice as much fecal coliform and other \nharmful bacteria as untreated water from the Euphrates River.\n  Yet incredibly, instead of banning Halliburton and KBR from competing \nfrom Katrina reconstruction work, the Bush administration awarded these \nsame companies multibillion dollar no-bid contracts for Katrina work.\n  Not only that, many of the contracting practices blamed for wasteful \nspending in Iraq--including the ``cost-plus'' provisions that guarantee \nprofits to contractors no matter how much they charge, or how well or \npoorly they perform--are being used in the gulf coast.\n  American taxpayers and the people of the gulf coast can't afford \nreconstruction based on the Halliburton business model of waste, fraud, \nand abuse. We must increase oversight and accountability in Iraq, and \nwe must demand the same accountability here at home.\n  A growing number of reports demonstrate why this bill is needed.\n  Since November 2003, Congress has appropriated $21 billion for Iraq \nreconstruction and relief. On a bipartisan basis, this Congress has \ngiven the President everything he has asked for to support his \nambitious plans to rebuild Iraq.\n  Earlier this week, Stuart Bowen, the Special Inspector General for \nIraq Reconstruction, told the Senate Armed Services Readiness \nSubcommittee that nearly all of that money is either spent or \nobligated, and what remains, ``will not permit completion of all \nprojects that were envisioned.''\n  We know how dangerous Iraq has become, not only for our troops but \nalso for everyone involved in reconstruction. Dangerous conditions \nthere have caused many setbacks and delays, and they have forced USAID, \nthe Department of State, and others to devote increasing amounts of \nmoney to security, rather than reconstruction. Security is and will \nremain a serious problem, but it is by no means the only reason that \nthe United States Government has spent billions of dollars for Iraqi \nreconstruction--and Iraq still struggles to rebuild.\n  The reports of the Special Inspector General for Iraqi Reconstruction \nfully address the serious security challenges our men and women in Iraq \nface today, and every day, but they also paint a grim picture of \nconditions in Iraq, and of poor planning, execution, and oversight of \nreconstruction efforts by the administration.\n  Let me be very clear: These failings are not the fault of our troops \nor of the men and women of USAID, of the Department of State, and other \nagencies that are risking their lives and working heroically to help \nthe Iraqi people rebuild their shattered nation and create a better \nfuture, and they deserve our thanks and respect.\n  The Special Inspector General found that the CPA--the Coalition \nProvisional Authority--burned through nearly $100 million in \nDevelopment Fund for Iraq money with few records to show for how that \nmoney was spent. In many instances, the money simply vanished. That is \nsimply inexcusable.\n  In the town of Hillah, for example, the Special Inspector General \nfound that the CPA left $7 million worth of projects uncompleted. The \nmoney allocated for these projects is missing.\n  Thanks to the good work of Special Inspector General Bowen, the \nAmerican criminal justice system is going to hold at least a few people \naccountable.\n  Unfortunately, because of poor recordkeeping, there may be no way now \nto trace and recover all of the billions of dollars that have \ndisappeared in Iraq.\n\n[[Page S1131]]\n\n  But where we can track fraud and overbilling to specific companies, \nwhy would we give more money to these same offenders?\n  This week, the President sent Congress a budget proposal for next \nyear that cuts Medicare, Medicaid, student loans, veterans' health, and \nmany other vital programs America depends on.\n  I am deeply concerned about the deficits that have built up under \nthis President. In 5 years, we've gone from a $5 trillion projected \nsurplus to multi-trillion dollar projected deficits as far as the eye \ncan see. We must restore fiscal sanity to the Federal budget. But \nbefore we cut health care for seniors and veterans or student loans, we \nshould cut out the waste, fraud, and abuse in Federal reconstruction \ncontracts.\n  We must ensure that reconstruction dollars meant to help Katrina \nvictims rebuild their lives are not diverted to irresponsible \ncontractors seeking to pad their bottom lines. Whether the work is done \nin Iraq or in Louisiana, Alabama, or Mississippi, there must be \nhonesty, transparency, and accountability.\n  General John Abizaid, the commander of the U.S. Central Command, has \nsaid that the key to military success in Iraq ``is whether we can learn \nfrom our mistakes.''\n  Five months ago, when the President addressed the Nation from Jackson \nSquare in New Orleans, he said, ``Americans have every right to expect \na more effective response in a time of emergency. When the federal \ngovernment fails to meet such an obligation, I, as President, am \nresponsible for the problem, and for the solution. This government will \nlearn the lessons of Hurricane Katrina.''\n  This is the test. If we are serious about correcting mistakes, there \nmust be accountability. We cannot reward companies that have cheated \nthe American people with even more taxpayer dollars, with little or no \noversight. Our troops who are risking their lives deserve better. Our \nfellow American citizens who are struggling to rebuild their lives and \ncommunities in the gulf coast deserve better. And the American \ntaxpayers who are paying the bills deserve better.\n  We have the biggest economy in the world. We don't need to rely on \njust a few privileged firms to do America's work. We don't need over-\nbillers, underperformers, chiselers, and cheats to do America's work.\n  America's work and American taxpayer dollars should go to companies \nthat believe in accountability, responsibility, and honest work for an \nhonest dollar.\n  There are countless firms that fit that bill--in the gulf coast \nregion, in Illinois, and across America. By weeding out companies that \nhave cheated taxpayers, my bill will assure that those hard-working \nfirms have a fair shot to compete for Federal reconstruction dollars in \nIraq and at home.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2277\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

He was previously President of the Washington \n     Post Company, having served 18 years in various leadership \n     roles.

Spoon of Massachusetts, is filled by reappointment \n     of the incumbent for a term of 6 years. The reappointment \n     shall take effect on the date of enactment of this joint \n     resolution.\n                                  ____\n\n     Phillip Frost\n     Chairman of the Board and CEO, Ivax Corporation, Miami Beach, \n         FL\n       Nationally recognized for his creative enterprise, business \n     and marketing acumen, and generous support of education and \n     the arts, Phillip Frost has held leadership positions with \n     numerous corporations and organizations. Born in \n     Philadelphia, where his family lived above his father's shoe \n     store, Dr. Frost worked at a brother's hardware store before \n     heading to the University of Pennsylvania. There Dr. Frost \n     majored in French literature and spent one year studying at \n     the University of Paris, a seminal period that led to Dr. \n     Frost's life-long commitment to the arts. He and his wife, \n     Patricia, who is chair of the Smithsonian National Board, are \n     renowned collectors who gave their 113-piece collection of \n     American abstract art to the Smithsonian in 1986; they also \n     have stated their interest in exploring the possibility of \n     providing significant support for a major exhibition on \n     medical history at the National Museum of American History.\n       After receiving his B.A. from the University of \n     Pennsylvania in 1957 and his M.D. from the Albert Einstein \n     College of Medicine in New York in 1961, Dr. Frost completed \n     his internship at New York's Montefiore Hospital and his \n     residency in dermatology at the\n\n[[Page S1132]]\n\n     Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. He then served as \n     a lieutenant commander in the U.S. Public Health Service at \n     the National Cancer Institute and completed a one-year senior \n     residency at Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami. He joined \n     the faculty of the University of Miami School of Medicine in \n     1966 and then moved to Mount Sinai Medical Center of Greater \n     Miami, chairing its Department of Dermatology from 1972 to \n     1990.\n       While at Mt. Sinai, Dr. Frost sold a disposable instrument \n     for skin biopsies to Miles Laboratory. He and his partner in \n     that venture then purchased Key Pharmaceuticals, which was \n     later sold to Schering-Plough for $600 million. Eager to \n     explore the then-unglamorous world of generic drugs, Dr. \n     Frost next founded IVAX Corporation, which became recognized \n     for its consumer-directed research, development, manufacture, \n     and marketing of pharmaceutical products worldwide. Since \n     1987, Dr. Frost has served as chairman of the board of \n     directors and chief executive officer of IVAX; he also was \n     president from 1991 to 1995. IVAX was recently acquired by \n     TEVA Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. and, according to \n     published reports, Dr. Frost will receive more than $1 \n     billion of TEVA stock as a result of its sale.\n       Dr. Frost is a director of Northrop Grumman Corporation, \n     Continucare Corporation, Cellular Technical Services Co., \n     Inc., and Ladenburg Thalmann Financial Services Inc. He also \n     is co-vice chairman of the American Stock Exchange's board of \n     governors and a trustee of Scripps Research Institute and \n     previously served as chairman of the board of directors of \n     Key Pharmaceuticals, Inc., chairman of Whitman Education \n     Group, Inc., and vice chairman of the board of directors of \n     American Vaccine, Inc. In addition, Dr. Frost possesses \n     significant fiscal experience with matters of government \n     oversight.\n       Residents of Florida for over 40 years, Dr. and Mrs. Frost \n     also have been ardent supporters of local community efforts. \n     In addition to their commitment to the visual arts, the \n     Frosts made a $33 million gift to the University of Miami for \n     its school of music (now called the Phillip and Patricia \n     Frost School of Music), one of the largest individual gifts \n     the university ever has received. Dr. Frost serves as \n     campaign co-chair of the fund-raising initiative ``Momentum: \n     The Campaign for the University of Miami,'' having previously \n     served as chairman of its board of trustees, and co-chaired \n     the successful launch of the Miami Art Museum's fund-raising \n     campaign ``Art for All People.'' He is a former member of the \n     Florida International University (FIU) Foundation board and \n     the FIU board of trustees. The Patricia & Phillip Frost Art \n     Museum at FIU is so-named as a tribute to their longstanding \n     support; likewise, the university presented Dr. Frost with an \n     honorary degree in 1993 for his many contributions in \n     medicine, business, and community service. He also was named \n     the 2001 National Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year.\n       Since 1987, Phillip Frost has served as chairman of the \n     board of directors and chief executive officer of Ivax \n     Corporation, which was recently acquired by TEVA \n     Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.; he also was president of IVAX \n     from 1991 to 1995.

Sophisticated collectors of American abstract art, \n     they gave their 113-piece collection to the Smithsonian \n     American Art Museum in 1986. The Frost's $33 million gift to \n     the University of Miami for its school of music (now called \n     the Phillip and Patricia Frost School of Music) was one of \n     the largest individual gifts the university has ever \n     received, and the largest ever made to a university school of \n     music in the United States. Dr. Frost also serves as chair of \n     the fundraising initiative ``Momentum: The Campaign for the \n     University of Miami'' and has served as chair of the Miami \n     Art Museum's fundraising campaign ``Art for All People.'' \n     Additionally, he is a former member of the Florida \n     International University (FIU) Foundation board and the FIU \n     board of trustees.

We will \nhave multiple votes starting close to 10 a.m. Senators should plan to \nstay around the floor for a series of up to 16 stacked votes in the \nmorning. I truly hope that some of those will not be pushed to a \nrollcall vote and we would finish at a reasonable time.\n  Tomorrow afternoon, we will resume consideration of S. 852, the \nasbestos bill. There is a pending motion to waive the Budget Act that \nmust be disposed of before we can move forward with the amendment \nprocess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/13/senate-section/article/S1133-6", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1133]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:45 A.M.
