Mr. President, today we formally begin the consideration \nof John Roberts to be Chief Justice of the United States. In a moment, \nwe will proceed to executive session to begin the debate on that \nnomination. In order to facilitate the debate on the Roberts \nnomination, we have set aside controlled time so that Members can \nbetter plan when they will be speaking to the body. I know many Members \nwill want to come to the floor to speak on this important nomination. \nHowever, I hope Senators do not feel compelled to make lengthy \nstatements. We will stay each night this week if the Senators desire to \nspeak, but I would like to reach an agreement as to when that final \nvote will occur so that Members can plan accordingly. I will be \ndiscussing a time certain for that vote with the Democratic leader as \nwe go forward with the debate.\n  Last week, I announced that we would have a vote today beginning \napproximately 5:30. Shortly, we expect to have that vote locked in by \nunanimous consent. We have about 24 nominations that are pending on the \nExecutive Calendar. We will likely set one of those pending nominations \nfor a vote. As always, we will alert Members when that vote is set.\n  Also, this week we need to address the continuing resolution as we \nend the fiscal year. We will continue working on the appropriations \nprocess following the vote on the Roberts nomination.\n  The appropriations bill for the Defense Department will be reported \nthis week, and we expect to quickly turn to that bill.\n  Having said that, I look forward to a good debate and good discussion \non John Roberts, followed by the vote on his confirmation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/26/senate-section/article/S10395-7", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10395-S10414]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n NOMINATION OF JOHN G. ROBERTS, JR. TO BE CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE UNITED \n                                 STATES\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider Executive Calendar No. 317, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of John G. Roberts, Jr., of \nMaryland, to be Chief Justice of the United States.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, 19 years ago today, on September 26, 1986, \nWilliam Rehnquist took the oath of office as the 16th Chief Justice of \nthe United States.\n  Today, nearly two decades later, the Senate is faced with a unique \nopportunity to provide advice and consent on the nomination of John \nRoberts as our Nation's 17th Chief Justice.\n  As we debate Judge Roberts' nomination over the next few days, I ask \nthat we think about the task the American people have entrusted to us.\n  Over the next few days, they will be watching and waiting. They will \nbe scoring us on how well we perform our duty.\n  They will be looking to see if we proceed in an honorable and \ndignified manner--to see if we work together in a bipartisan way--and \nto see if we put principle above partisan politics.\n  The qualifications they expect us to look at for a Supreme Court \nJustice are unambiguous. They expect an individual who is qualified, an \nindividual who will faithfully interpret the Constitution, an \nindividual who will check politics and personal views at the door of \nthe Court, an individual who will approach every case with a fair and \nopen mind.\n  As Senators, our duties are clear. The question now becomes, and the \nquestion each of us must answer is, Is\n\n[[Page S10396]]\n\nJohn Roberts fit to serve as Chief Justice of the United States? Does \nhe possess each of the qualities that the American people expect and \nqualities that our highest Court deserves?\n  In answering these questions, I recommend that we take a hard look at \nwhat we have learned about John Roberts over these last several weeks.\n  From his resume, we know he graduated at the top of his class from \nboth Harvard College and Harvard Law School. At Harvard, he was editor \nof one of the most well-respected law journals in America.\n  He has argued 39 cases before the Supreme Court, and he has earned \nbipartisan respect as one of the finest appellate advocates in the \nNation.\n  He served two Presidents in prominent positions. The American Bar \nAssociation gave John Roberts the highest rating possible--``well-\nqualified''--on three occasions.\n  We know he has earned respect from both sides of the political \ndivide.\n  During the committee hearing 2 weeks ago, my distinguished Democratic \ncolleague, Senator Biden, said Judge Roberts was ``one of the best \nwitnesses to come before [the] committee'' in his 30-some years.\n  Senator Feinstein complimented Judge Roberts for getting through the \nhearing ``in a remarkable way.''\n  Senator Schumer called him ``one of the best litigators in America'' \nand praised his ``amazing knowledge of the law.''\n  Senator Schumer went on to say that Judge Roberts ``may very well \npossess the most powerful intellect of any person to come before the \nSenate for this position.''\n  I agree with all of my colleagues' observations. John Roberts' record \nspeaks for itself. And I believe that in the committee testimony he has \nearnestly and effectively shown America the face of John Roberts.\n  We know he understands the importance of judicial restraint and \njudicial independence. We know Judge Roberts appreciates that the role \nof a judge is to interpret the law and not to legislate from the bench. \nHe understands that a judge is a humble servant of the law but never \nabove the law.\n\n  In the words that captured his core philosophy, and captured the \nminds of Americans, Judge Roberts said:\n\n       [J]udges are servants of the law, not the other way around. \n     Judges are like umpires. Umpires don't make the rules; they \n     apply them. . . .\n\n  And we know that Judge Roberts will not allow his personal political \nviews to interfere with his judicial decisions.\n  In the hearings, he stressed that he has no political agenda but, \nrather, a commitment to ``confront every case with an open mind,'' ``to \nfully and fairly analyze the legal arguments that are presented,'' and \nto ``decide every case based on the record, according to the rule of \nlaw, without fear or favor, to the best of [his] ability.''\n  John Roberts has been open and forthcoming in the committee hearings. \nHe has answered questions thoroughly, without compromising the \nindependence to which he is entitled. He has provided this body with \nmore than ample information to evaluate his merit.\n  In total, Senators have had access to over 100,000 pages of documents \nfrom his service in the Federal Government. And Judge Roberts endured \nalmost 20 hours of committee testimony, including over 700 questions.\n  We have learned a lot about Judge John Roberts in the course of the \nlast few weeks. And in one's personal interactions with John Roberts, \nwe have all learned a little more. I know I have.\n  Getting to know John Roberts, I will say that truly he has a \nbrilliant legal mind. He is ``the brightest of the bright.''\n  Above all, as his record reflects on the D.C. Circuit, John Roberts \nembodies the word that should be synonymous with every judge. He is \nfair. He is thoughtful. He is capable. He is hard working. He is \ndriven. And John Roberts is a man of integrity. He is honest. He is \ndevoted to his family.\n  These are qualities we want in the men and women who serve our Nation \non the High Court. They are the qualities that will move America \nforward. John Roberts has proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that he has \nthe qualification and the temperament, the knowledge and the \nunderstanding to serve as America's next Chief Justice. And in the eyes \nof my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I sense that agreement.\n  As we move to this final stage of advice and consent, I urge my \ncolleagues to continue to work toward that deadline of October 3 so \nthat John Roberts can be on the bench when the Supreme Court begins its \nnew term, and the Court can then be at full strength.\n  I look forward to a thoughtful and respectful debate on John Roberts' \nnomination, and then a fair up-or-down vote on confirmation later this \nweek.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, many times we dwell on the negative, and \nthat is unfortunate.\n  The debate that will take place this week speaks well of the process \nto this point.\n  I just saw Senator Leahy walk through the Chamber. The other Member I \nwanted to mention briefly is Senator Specter, who is here in the \nChamber.\n  The Judiciary Committee has acted in an exemplary fashion this past \ncouple of months, with all the preliminaries that go into selecting a \nSupreme Court Justice--the first time we have had a new Supreme Court \nJustice in 11 years.\n  Senator Specter and Senator Leahy are to be commended for the good \nwork they have done.\n  Three weeks ago, I called Senator Specter and told him I thought he \nwas moving on very well, and I complimented him on the good job he was \ndoing in moving this forward.\n  There are strong feelings on each side. There are people voting no \nand people voting yes, but it has all been very respectful.\n  The heavy lifting of this nomination took place within the committee \nwhen 18 members of that committee spent a tremendous amount of time \nreading reports, and then, of course, in recent days asking questions \nthat they had worked on for days and days before asking the questions.\n  So I want the record to be spread here with the fact that this shows \nhow a legislative body should work. It doesn't mean everyone has to \nagree on the outcome. It just means you have to work in a respectful \nway to get to that outcome. We will have an outcome this week.\n  I say through the Chair to my distinguished friend, the Republican \nleader, from all I have been able to determine on our side, we would be \ncertainly able to vote sometime in the morning on Thursday, if that \nwould be appropriate. We might be pushing the envelope a little bit to \ntry to finish on Wednesday. But I think we could finish with ease on \nThursday with the schedule that people have.\n  I say that to my friend. Again, I say to Senator Specter--him being \npresent, and Senator Leahy not being present but saying the same to \nhim--it really makes me feel good to know that our committee system \nworks as it should, and it certainly did in this instance.\n\n\n                           Senate Priorities\n\n  Mr. President, in the days and weeks since Katrina, there is no doubt \nthat the American people have done their part to help.\n  I watched an interview over the weekend with a representative of the \nRed Cross who said they would soon be at $1 billion in money having \ncome to the Red Cross from people of good will in the United States.\n  I think the American people have done their part to help, but I \nthink--and I say this with some hesitation but certainly with as much \naffirmation as I can--the Republican-controlled Congress has not done \nits share. It has been a month. We have seen Hurricane Katrina come and \ngo. We have seen Hurricane Rita come and go. And here we are, having \ndone next to nothing to get victims the urgent relief they need.\n  Instead of letting the Senate address Katrina disaster relief in a \ncomprehensive way, Republicans have spent the last 4 weeks debating the \nCommerce-State-Justice appropriations bill and the agriculture \nappropriations bill. These are important pieces of legislation but not \nnearly as important as the disaster relief measures that would give \nthese people help immediately. These appropriations bills do little to \nhelp the victims. They do not offer us the opportunity to do more.\n  These bills, when they come to the floor, are in a parliamentary \nfashion\n\n[[Page S10397]]\n\nwhere they cannot be amended except in very strict ways. People who \nwant to offer amendments dealing with Katrina have to use some \npolitical gyrations to be able to get a vote, and that is a two-thirds \nnumber they have to come up with to have it passed, which is very \ndifficult to do. So I would hope we could get to some of these bills \nquickly.\n  I have said this before, and I do not want to sound like a broken \nrecord, but yesterday we lost three more troops in Iraq. I got a call \nlate last night from Colonel Herbert, who is with the Nevada National \nGuard, a person who has devoted his life to the military. He said: \nSenator, I lost two of my men yesterday in a helicopter that went down \nin Afghanistan. He felt very bad. One of the pilots and one of the crew \nchiefs, both from Nevada, were killed.\n  This morning I was at Bethesda Naval Medical Center. As I walked in, \nthere was a man in a wheelchair, missing both legs, and obviously he \nhad had some trauma to his head. The naval officer who was with me \nindicated he was one who had been in the hospital, then left, and now \nis back. But yet in the Senate we have not done a bill to take care of \nthese people.\n  In spite of the fact we have almost 2,000 Americans who have been \nkilled in Iraq--we are spending upwards of $2.5 billion a week in \nIraq--and that we are causing the ranks of the veterans to increase \ndramatically, we do not have a bill to take care of them. We have a \nbill, but we are not allowed to bring it to the floor. The Defense \nauthorization bill, which sets up the funding and the other matters to \ntake care of the active personnel who wear the uniform of the United \nStates, plus our Guard and Reserve, plus the many obligations we as a \nnation have to our veterans--we are not debating that bill to do that. \nWe spent a couple days on it.\n  These bills average about 2 weeks before we finish them. We are not \ngoing to that bill because the Republican-controlled Senate will not \nlet us. We are going to do something that is unusual. We just heard \nfrom the distinguished majority leader that after we finish the Roberts \nnomination, we are going to bypass the Defense authorization bill and \ngo to the Defense appropriations bill which we have not authorized.\n  What we normally do is we authorize within certain limits and then we \nbring the appropriations bills to the floor of the Senate and \nappropriate moneys for what we have authorized. We have not authorized \nanything, but we are going to appropriate, anyway.\n  There are lots of amendments pending. My staff and Senator Levin's \nstaff worked with counterparts on the Republican side Friday to say: We \nwill get rid of all our amendments. We will have 10 or 12 amendments. \nThat is all we want. We would have one that would relate to the gulf, \nto Katrina, and the other 10 or 11 would be related to the Defense \nauthorization bill. There is still no approval on that.\n  So those people who care about what is going on in Iraq--and that is \nmost everyone--and those who care about what is going on in \nAfghanistan--and that is most everyone--should understand the bill we \nare not going to take up gives our troops and veterans the assistance \nthey need.\n  Senator Warner and Senator Levin, who are the chairman and ranking \nmember of that committee, have provided in the bill before the Senate \n$21 billion in new spending for the military, $50 billion extra for \ncovering operations in Iraq, and a 3.1-percent pay raise and other \nbenefits to people in the United States military, which we are not \ngoing to be able to debate or vote on. We are not going to be able to \namend the bill. That is too bad. It is really too bad. I think it shows \na lack of respect for the people in the military, as indicated by my \ntrip to Bethesda today.\n  In addition to that, we made little progress on S. 1637, the Katrina \nEmergency Relief Act of 2005. This is a bill that we Democrats \nsubmitted. It is a relief plan to give health care, housing, education, \nand financial relief to those people who need it. It was introduced the \nweek after the hurricane. We still have not been able to get an \nagreement from the majority--Senate Republicans--as to how to proceed \non this bill. None of the items have made it here to the desk, but yet \nwe hear people complaining that Katrina is going to cost too much money \nand they want to start making cuts in Government programs. I am happy \nto take a look at that. But the first place we should look is at the \nbudget here in the Senate. In the Senate, we authorize and appropriate, \nwe pass a budget, and then we execute that with something called \nreconciliation. The budget we are working on is immoral. And those are \nnot my words; those are words that were written by the leaders--not \nsome offshoot groups--the leaders, the chief executives of the major \nProtestant religions in the United States--Lutherans, Methodists, \nEpiscopalians, and others. I read into the Record the night we had that \nmeasure on the floor a letter from them saying: The budget is immoral. \nDon't vote for it. It passed with a party-line vote. The Republicans \npassed this, what they referred to as an immoral document. Let's not \nexecute that. These church leaders were visionary. They knew then it \nwas immoral. Today it is even worse.\n\n  What are we being asked to do with the reconciliation? We are being \nasked to give $70 billion in added tax cuts to the rich--$70 billion. \nWe are being asked to cut $10 billion from Medicaid. Medicaid, a \nmedical program that goes to the poorest of the poor, we are being \nasked to cut $10 billion from that. That is in this budget we are being \nasked to execute. We are being asked to cut student loans, to cut food \nstamps. If we want a big offset, get rid of the $70 billion tax cut \nnow.\n  Times have changed. Our priorities must change with them. America can \ndo better. We can start doing better today with bipartisan health care \nrelief for survivors of Katrina. We have all heard about how the State \ngovernments of Louisiana, Mississippi, and even Alabama are struggling \nto provide health care. But many States in the region and elsewhere \nthat have accepted thousands of Katrina evacuees are facing a similar \nproblem. There are 60,000 evacuees in Arkansas.\n  We know no matter how hard these States try, they lack the resources \nto do what is needed, and many survivors will be left behind--and have \nbeen left behind. Only the Federal Government has the resources to \naddress the evacuees' health care and other needs.\n  Fortunately, Senator Grassley, the chairman of the Finance Committee, \nand the ranking member, Max Baucus, set aside partisan differences and \nrecognized this fact, that help is needed--and needed now--and they \nhave come together and crafted a compromise to ensure that Katrina's \nvictims will be covered under Medicaid, wherever they are, with full \nFederal funding.\n  This package does not provide coverage regardless of income, as my \nbill would have, but it is a good compromise. Senators Grassley and \nBaucus are to be commended. It will provide relief to many who need it. \nWe need to pass this bill. We need to get the House to agree with this \nbipartisan approach so we can get the bill to the President's desk as \nsoon as possible. We need to do this now. Proceeding with business as \nusual, while the administration relies on bureaucratic waivers on a \nState-by-State basis, will not, and has not, gotten the job done.\n  The White House approach will not provide care, for example, to a 55-\nyear-old grandmother or father who has found a job but still needs \nhealth care. It will not ensure uniform coverage from State to State. \nIt will not expedite the process for victims and States who have \nalready waited too long. It will not ease the financial burden that \ndestination States are being asked to shoulder, such as Arkansas. And \nit will not provide relief to the States hit by Hurricane Katrina. In \nfact, it may make their situations even worse.\n  The Finance Committee bill enjoys bipartisan support in the Senate, \nand support from our Governors, State Medicaid directors, and numerous \npatient and provider groups.\n  There is no reason to wait any longer. We were ready to clear the \nbill Thursday. It was cleared on our side. It was all ready to go. Not \non that side. We said: Let's wait a couple hours. No. We couldn't do it \non Thursday. ``Let's come in Friday to do it.'' ``No, we can't do it on \nFriday.'' ``Let's do it on Monday.'' ``Can't do it on Monday''--\nalthough we are going to ask sometime today unanimous consent that we \ntake this bill up and pass it. Our side has and will agree. I would \nhope we can do that. It is so important. States are\n\n[[Page S10398]]\n\nbeing hurt. They cannot bear the burden of the disaster that befell us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). Under the previous order, the \ntime from 1:30 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. will be under the control of the \nmajority leader or his designee.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this afternoon, the Senate begins the \ndebate on the confirmation of Judge John G. Roberts, Jr., to be Chief \nJustice of the United States. It is not an overstatement to note this \nis a historic debate. At the age of 50, Judge Roberts, if confirmed, \nhas the potential to serve as Chief Justice until the year 2040 or \nbeyond.\n  Today, Justice John Paul Stevens, at the age of 85, continues to \nserve. If you project Judge Roberts ahead 35 years, it would be to the \nyear 2040. Obviously, by that time it will be a very different world. \nThere will be very different issues which will confront the Court with \nthe advances in technology, with the advances in brain scanning, key \nquestions as to how far the privilege against self-incrimination goes \nto scan someone's brain. Will it be like a blood test and fingerprints \nor will it be viewed as invasive and a violation of a right to privacy? \nThose are the kinds of issues which Judge Roberts will confront if \nconfirmed as Chief Justice.\n  He also has the potential to project a new image on the Supreme \nCourt. That Court has been buffeted by a whole series of 5-to-4 \ndecisions. Candidly, some of them are inexplicable, where you have, \nthis year, the Supreme Court of the United States saying that Texas \ncould display the Ten Commandments outdoors, but Kentucky could not \ndisplay the Ten Commandments indoors. There are some minor differences, \nbut it is hard to understand how the Ten Commandments can be shown in \nTexas but not in Kentucky by a 5-to-4 vote.\n  Under the very important legislation of the Americans With \nDisabilities Act, the Supreme Court had two 5-to-4 decisions 3 years \napart. One, in a case captioned Garrett v. University of Alabama, in \n2001, the Supreme Court declared the title unconstitutional which dealt \nwith discrimination against the disabled in employment.\n  Three years later, in Tennessee v. Lane, the Supreme Court upheld the \nconstitutionality of another title of the Americans with Disabilities \nAct which dealt with access to public accommodations. We have seen a \nproliferation of opinions with multiple concurrences, making them very \nhard to understand. Earlier this year, the Judiciary Committee took up \nthe issue of what was happening in Guantanamo, and a study was \nundertaken on three opinions handed down by the Supreme Court in June \nof last year. On one case, they couldn't get a majority, a plurality of \nfour, so there was no holding. In the other two cases, there were \nconcurrences and dissents. You have a pattern which exists where \nJustice A will write a concurring opinion, joined by Justice B, and \nJustice B will write a separate concurring opinion, joined by Justice A \nand Justice C.\n  This is an issue which was considered during the course of Judge \nRoberts' hearings. It is one where a new judge, a new Chief Justice at \nthe age of 50, will have an opportunity to make some very systemic \nchanges in the way the Court functions. When Judge Roberts was \nquestioned about his ability to handle this matter--first during the \ninformal meeting in my office and later in the hearings--he said he \nthought he could handle it because, in his many appearances before the \nSupreme Court, some 39 in number, it was a dialog among equals. I was \nimpressed by his concept of a dialog among equals, that he considered \nhimself as a lawyer arguing before the Court to be dealing with equals. \nI have had occasion three times to appear before the Supreme Court, and \nit didn't seem to me like a dialog among equals. But when you have been \nthere 39 times and you know the Justices as well as he does--and the \nword is that the Justices very much applaud his nomination to be Chief \nJustice--he has the potential almost from a running start to bring a \nnew day and a new era to the Supreme Court. That is a very attractive \nfeature about his projection as Chief Justice.\n  We know the famous historical story about Earl Warren's becoming \nChief Justice in 1953. The Court was then faced with Brown v. Board of \nEducation, the desegregation case. There were many disputes in the \nCourt at that time. They had to carry the case over. Chief Justice \nWarren was able to get a unanimous Court, which was important, so that \ncontentious issue was one where nine Justices agreed and came down with \nan opinion which was obviously difficult to implement but had a great \ndeal more stature because of its unanimity. So here is an extra bonus \nfor the Court, an extra bonus for America, if confirmed as Chief \nJustice: the potential that Judge Roberts has to promote a new day and \na new era for the Court administratively.\n  On his qualifications, Judge Roberts was rated ``well qualified'' by \nthe American Bar Association. It is understandable, since he was a \nsumma cum laude graduate of Harvard College, magna cum laude graduate \nof Harvard Law School; had a very distinguished career as assistant to \nAttorney General William French Smith, after serving as a clerk to a \ndistinguished Second Circuit judge, Henry Friendly; then served as \nclerk to then Associate Justice William Rehnquist; then, following his \nwork with Attorney General William French Smith, became associate White \nHouse counsel; practiced with the prestigious law firm of Hogan & \nHartson--Hogan & Hartson was prestigious before Judge Roberts got there \nbut a lot more so after he was there and, frankly, after he left--then \nhis status as a premier appellate lawyer; then the Supreme Court with \nsome 39 cases.\n  It was my view that Judge Roberts has a broad, expansive \nunderstanding of the application of the Constitution. He said:\n\n       They\n\n--referring to the Framers--\n\n     were crafting a document that they intended to apply in a \n     meaningful way down through the ages.\n\n  While he would not quite accept my characterization of agreement with \nJustice John Marshall Harlan on the document being a living thing, he \ndid say that the core principles of liberty and due process had broad \nmeaning as applied to evolving societal conditions. He is not an \noriginalist. He is not looking to original intent. But he sees the \nConstitution for the ages and adaptable to evolving societal \nconditions.\n  On the issue of how many questions he answered before the Judiciary \nCommittee, I believe he answered more than most but, candidly, did not \nanswer as many questions as I would like to have had him answer. I will \ndetail that in the course of this brief presentation.\n  I have observed, in the 10 Supreme Court nominations where I have had \nthe privilege to participate on the Judiciary Committee, that nominees \nanswer about as many questions as they believe they have to in order to \nbe confirmed. But it has become an evolving process. A view of some of \nthe history of Supreme Court nominations is relevant to see what has \nhappened, what is in the course of happening, and what the next nominee \nmay face.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee has conducted hearings on nominees \nonly since 1916--that is, for the Supreme Court--with the nomination of \nLouis Brandeis by President Woodrow Wilson. Justice Brandeis did not \nappear. The first time a nominee appeared before the committee was in \n1925. The nominee was Harlan Fiske Stone. An issue had arisen as to \nwhether there was a political motivation in the controversial \ninvestigation into the conduct of Judge Burton Wheeler. Justice Stone \nasked to appear to respond to the allegations. He did so, and he was \nconfirmed.\n  In 1939, President Roosevelt nominated Felix Frankfurter, who \ninitially refused to appear personally, but after being attacked for \nhis foreign birth, his religious beliefs, and his associations, \nFrankfurter decided to appear. He read from a prepared statement, \nrefused to discuss his personal views on issues before the Supreme \nCourt. His hearing lasted only an hour and a half in duration and did \nnot set a precedent for future nominees.\n\n  In 1949, Sherman Minton, who had been a U.S. Senator, became the only \nSupreme Court nominee to refuse to testify before the Judiciary \nCommittee. Minton wrote to the committee:\n\n       I feel the personal participation by the nominee in the \n     committee proceedings related to his nomination presents a \n     serious question of propriety, particularly when I\n\n[[Page S10399]]\n\n     might be required to express my views on highly controversial \n     and litigious issues affecting the Court.\n\n  Notwithstanding Minton's refusal, the committee conducted its hearing \nin Minton's absence and confirmed him. It wasn't until 1955, with the \nnomination of Justice John Marshall Harlan, that nominees have appeared \nregularly before the Judiciary Committee. Only since 1981, following my \nown election in 1980, have the hearings taken on a little different \napproach as to what the nominees will answer. Justice O'Connor declined \nto answer many questions. The next nomination hearing was that for \nChief Justice Rehnquist, who was a sitting Associate Justice. Initially \nJustice Rehnquist declined to appear, then was advised that if he \nwanted to be confirmed, he would have to appear. It was a contentious \nhearing. As the record shows, Chief Justice Rehnquist was confirmed by \na vote of 65 to 33. He did answer a great many questions, although he \ndid not answer a great many questions.\n  I asked him a bedrock question as to whether Congress had the \nauthority to take away the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States on the first amendment. He declined to answer. Overnight \na Senate staffer brought me an article which had been written by a \nyoung Arizona lawyer in 1958 by the name of William H. Rehnquist which \nappeared in the Harvard Law Record. The young Arizona lawyer, William \nH. Rehnquist, was very tough on the Senate Judiciary Committee for the \nway it conducted its hearings for Charles Whittaker. Charles Whittaker \nwas from Kansas City. There are two Kansas Cities--one in Kansas and \none in Missouri. Justice Whittaker lived in one and practiced law in \nthe other. A big to-do was made about the fact that it would be an \nhonor to two States if he was confirmed, where he worked and where he \nlived.\n  This young lawyer from Arizona, Bill Rehnquist, didn't think that \namounted to a whole lot. He chastised the Senate Judiciary Committee \nfor not asking about due process and other constitutional issues. So in \nthe face of his declination to answer my questions on taking \njurisdiction away from the Supreme Court on the first amendment, I \nasked him if he was that William H. Rehnquist from Arizona. He said, \nyes, that was true, he was.\n  I said: Did you write this article?\n  He said: Yes, I did. Then he added quickly: And I was wrong.\n  So that didn't end the issue because having the authority of this \nyoung lawyer from Arizona, pretty good reasoning, I pursued the \nquestions. Finally, he answered the question on could the Congress take \naway the jurisdiction of the Court on the first amendment. He said, no, \nthe Congress could not do that.\n  So naturally I then asked about the fourth amendment, search and \nseizure. Could the Congress take away the jurisdiction from the Supreme \nCourt on search and seizure. He declined to answer that. I went to \namendment five on privilege against self-incrimination. Again he \ndeclined. And then six, on right to counsel, and seven, and eight on \ncruel and unusual punishment. Then I asked him a follow-up question: \nWhy would he answer on the first amendment but not on any of the \nothers? As you may suspect, he refused to answer that question as well.\n  It was my judgment that Chief Justice Rehnquist passed muster. It was \na battle. And then Justice Scalia came before the Senate following \nChief Justice Rehnquist. Justice Scalia would not answer any questions. \nAs I have said--and really too apocryphal--Justice Scalia wouldn't even \ngive his serial number. He would only give his name and rank. Prisoners \nof war are compelled to answer questions, but only three--name, rank, \nand serial number. But as I have said, and I have said this to Justice \nScalia in interpersonal banter, he wouldn't even give us his serial \nnumber. But it was perhaps an exhausted Senate following the \nconfirmation of Chief Justice Rehnquist or perhaps it was Justice \nScalia's superb academic and professional record, he would not even \nanswer the question as to whether he would uphold Marbury v. Madison, a \ndecision of the Supreme Court of the United States in 1803 where the \nCourt undertook the authority to interpret the Constitution and to \ninterpret the law and to be the final arbiter of the Constitution.\n\n  Then in 1987 the Judiciary Committee considered the nomination of \nJudge Bork from the District of Columbia Court of Appeals. Judge Bork \nhad very extensive writings in law reviews and books, many speeches, \nhad a very extensive paper trail, a controversial paper trail. Judge \nBork had written that absent original intent there was no judicial \nlegitimacy, and absent judicial legitimacy, there could not be judicial \nreview. Understandably, the committee had many questions for Judge \nBork, and in that context Judge Bork felt compelled to answer the \nquestions.\n  In the interim between Justice Scalia and Judge Bork, Senator \nDeConcini and I--Senator DeConcini being another member of the \nJudiciary Committee--had prepared a resolution to be submitted to the \nJudiciary Committee which would delineate an appropriate line of \nquestions for nominees in trying to set some standards and trying to \nset some parameters as to what we felt, what questions were appropriate \nand what questions had to be answered to warrant confirmation. After \nthe proceedings as to Judge Bork, we felt it unnecessary to move ahead \nwith that kind of a resolution.\n  The nomination of Justice Kennedy followed, and Justice Souter and \nthe other Justices, Justice Thomas, who answered a great many \nquestions, and then the nomination of Justice Ginsburg and the \nnomination of Justice Breyer. These nomination proceedings found the \nnominees answering some, not answering others, but essentially \nfollowing the rule that they answered about as many questions as they \nfelt they had to.\n  Judge Roberts answered more questions than most. He answered the \nquestion about the right of privacy in a very positive manner in \nresponse to questions which I asked, which Senator Kohl asked, and \nwhich others answered. He said there was a right of privacy. He said \nthe decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in Griswold v. \nConnecticut was a correct decision and he extended the contraception \nissue beyond marriage to those who were single, saying that right of \nprivacy existed, and upheld the propriety of the decision of the \nSupreme Court in the Eisenstadt case. Other nominees had refused to \nanswer such questions.\n  I felt that Judge Roberts did not answer some questions which I \nthought should have been answered. For example, I asked him about the \nappropriate standard for testing constitutionality under the commerce \nclause. We found in United States v. Lopez in 1995 that the Supreme \nCourt of the United States had cut back on congressional authority of \nthe Congress which had been in existence for almost 60 years. Then in \nthe case of the United States v. Morrison, the Court struck down \nportions of legislation designed to protect women against violence. \nThey did so on the stated principle that they disagreed with the \ncongressional ``method of reasoning.'' When I heard about that \nrationale, it seemed to me to be inappropriate. What was the Court's \nmethod of reasoning which was superior to the congressional method of \nreasoning? I find the matter of unique historical importance that the \ncolumns of the Senate are lined up exactly evenly with the columns of \nthe Supreme Court.\n  Interestingly, in an early draft of the Constitution, the Senate was \ngiven the authority to appoint Supreme Court Justices. I have seen or \nvisualized, conceptualized a certain parody with those columns lined up \nexactly the same. When I read the opinion of the Supreme Court 5 to 4 \nin the United States v. Morrison, striking down portions of the \nlegislation to protect women against violence, I wondered what was \nthere in the Supreme Court which led them to a method of reasoning \nsuperior to a congressional method of reasoning? What happens when you \nmove across the short space of green between the Supreme Court columns \nand the Senate's columns?\n  As the dissent pointed out, the opinion of the Court must have \npresumed some unique form of judicial competency. If you have a unique \nform of ``judicial competency,'' you must have a form of congressional \nincompetency which is hardly fitting in an analysis of cases and facts \nand a determination of\n\n[[Page S10400]]\n\nconstitutionality with the separation of powers between the Congress \nand the Court.\n  In the case of United States v. Morrison, the factual record exists \n``showing reports on gender bias from the task force in 21 states and 8 \nseparate reports'' issued by Congress in its committees over a long \ncourse of time. The dissent detailed all of the evidentiary basis and \nthen concluded ``there was a mountain of evidence.''\n  When I wrote to Justice Roberts by letter dated August 8 and August \n23, I had alerted him to this case and this question. At this point, I \nask unanimous consent the full text of those letters be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                    Commitee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, August 8, 2005.\n     Hon. John G. Roberts, Jr.\n     E. Barrett Prettyman Courthouse,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Judge Roberts: I write to give you advance notice of \n     some of the issues I will be asking at your confirmation \n     hearing. In addition to identifying topics, I think it is \n     helpful to outline the background for the questions to save \n     time at the hearing.\n       In addition to the commentaries of scholars and others \n     about the Supreme Court's judicial activism and the Court's \n     usurping Congressional authority, members of Congress are \n     irate about the Court's denigrating and, really, \n     disrespectful statements about Congress' competence. In U.S. \n     v. Morrison, the Court rejects Congressional findings because \n     of ``our method of reasoning''. As the dissent notes, the \n     Court's judgment is ``dependent upon a uniquely judicial \n     competence'' which implicitly criticizes a lesser quality of \n     Congressional competence.\n       In Morrison, the Court invalidated, by a 5-4 vote, \n     legislation on gender-motivated crimes of violence involving \n     three Virginia Polytechnical Institute football players who \n     were accused of raping a fellow student.\n       Chief Justice Rehnquist's opinion, interpreting the \n     Commerce Clause, held Congress cannot regulate ``non-\n     economic, violent criminal conduct based solely on that \n     conduct's aggregate effect on interstate commerce.'' The \n     Court acknowledged the ``contrast with the lack of \n     Congressional findings that we faced in Lopez'' and the Act \n     was ``supported by numerous findings regarding the serious \n     impact of gender-motivated violence on victims and their \n     families.''\n       Writing for four dissenters, Justice Souter referred to \n     ``the mountain of data assembled by Congress here showing the \n     effects of violence against women on interstate commerce.'' \n     Citing longstanding precedents, the dissent said:\n       ``The business of the courts is to review the Congressional \n     assessment not for soundness but simply for the rationality \n     of concluding that a jurisdictional basis exists in fact.''\n       Noting the obvious advantage Congress has in its fact-\n     finding procedures contrasted with the Court's limitations, \n     the Souter dissent said:\n       ``The fact of such a substantial effect is not an issue for \n     the courts in the first instance . . . but for the Congress \n     where institutional capacity for gathering evidence and \n     taking testimony far exceeds ours.''\n       The Souter dissent further specified:\n       ``The record includes reports on gender bias from task \n     forces in 21 states and we have the benefit of specific \n     factual finding in eight separate reports issued by Congress \n     and its committees over the long course leading to its \n     enactment.''\n       From the New Deal Court in 1937 to the abrupt reversals in \n     Lopez and Morrison, Congressional authority under the \n     Commerce clause had gone unchallenged based on Justice \n     Harlan's rationale in the 1968 case Maryland v. Wirtz:\n       ``But where we find the legislators . . . have a rational \n     basis for finding a chosen regulatory scheme necessary to the \n     protection of commerce, our investigation is at an end.''\n       In the face of decades of precedents and a ``mountain of \n     data,'' Chief Justice Rehnquist rejected Congress' findings \n     because of our ``method of reasoning.''\n       To this Senator, who has labored through 25 years of \n     intense legislative hearings and fact-finding plus prior \n     public service and experience in the real world, my immediate \n     reaction is to wonder how the Court can possibly assert its \n     superiority in its ``method of reasoning'' over the reasoning \n     of the Congress.\n       The Souter dissent attacks the majority's ``'method of \n     reasoning'' dictum questioning the Court's judgment is \n     ``dependent upon a uniquely judicial competence.'' The \n     dissent then points out:\n       ``. . . these formalistic contrived confines of commerce \n     power in large measure provoked the judicial crisis of 1937'' \n     so that ``one might reasonably have doubted that Members of \n     this Court would ever again toy with a return to the days \n     before NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation which \n     brought the earlier and nearly disastrous experiment to an \n     end.''\n       The Souter dissent further notes the categorical formalism \n     ``. . . is useful in serving a conception of Federalism.'' A \n     reinvigoration of Federalism is, of course, the hallmark \n     agenda of the judicial activism of the Rehnquist Court.\n       Even with the Souter dissent referencing the crisis of \n     1937, I do not suggest any move as radical as President \n     Roosevelt's attempt to pack the Court. I do see a great deal \n     of popular and Congressional dissatisfaction with the \n     judicial activism; and, at a minimum, the Senate's \n     determination to confirm new justices who will respect \n     Congress' constitutional role.\n       My questions are:\n       (1) Is there any real justification for the Court's \n     denigrating Congress' ``method of reasoning'' in our \n     constitutional structure of separation of power where the \n     elected Congress has the authority to decide public policy on \n     issues such as gender-based violence effecting interstate \n     commerce?\n       (2) Is there any possible basis for the Court's \n     characterization of ``uniquely judicial competence'' \n     implicitly criticizing a lesser quality of Congressional \n     competence?\n       (3) Do you agree with Justice Harlan's jurisprudence \n     concerning legislation on the ``rational basis'' test as \n     embraced by the dissent contrasted with the majority opinion?\n       (4) What is your thinking on the jurisprudence of U.S. v. \n     Lopez and U.S. v. Morrison which overturned almost 60 years \n     of Congress' power under the Commerce Clause?\n           Sincerely,\n     Arlen Specter.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, August 23, 2005.\n     Hon. John G. Roberts, Jr.\n     U.S. Department of Justice,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Judge Roberts: Supplementing my letter on the Commerce \n     Clause, this letter deals with Supreme Court decisions on the \n     Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) which I intend to ask \n     you about at your confirmation hearing.\n       Like my first letter on the Commerce Clause, I am concerned \n     about the Supreme Court's judicial activism which has usurped \n     Congressional authority by creating, as Justice Scalia's \n     dissent in Tennessee v. Lane states, a ``flabby test'' which \n     is an ``invitation to judicial arbitrariness by policy driven \n     decision-making''. The ``ill-advised'' result, as the Scalia \n     dissent further notes, is for the Court to set itself up as \n     ``taskmaster'' to determine that Congress has done its \n     ``homework'' which demonstrates lack of respect for a co-\n     equal branch of government.\n       Except for the swing vote of Justice O'Connor and the \n     dramatic image of a paraplegic crawling up the steps to a \n     courtroom, it is hard to discern a significant legal \n     difference between Alabama v. Garrett, decided in 2001 \n     involving ADA Title I discrimination in Employment, and \n     Tennessee v. Lane, decided in 2004 involving ADA Title II \n     discrimination in pubic accommodations.\n       In Lane, a 5-4 decision, with Justice O'Connor in the \n     majority, the Court upheld the constitutionality of the Act \n     in mandating access by a paraplegic who had to crawl up the \n     steps to a second floor courtroom to answer criminal charges. \n     In Garrett, a 5-4 majority, with Justice O'Connor in the \n     majority, the Court declared the Act unconstitutional in \n     seeking to hold the state liable for employment \n     discrimination.\n       These decisions pose two major problems: (1) A lack of \n     stability or predictability in the law because the two cases, \n     decided three years apart, are virtually indistinguishable; \n     and (2) The Court's judicial activism in functioning as a \n     super-legislature.\n       Dissenting in Lane, Chief Justice Rehnquist complained that \n     the majority referenced the same Congressional task force's \n     ``unexamined, anecdotal'' evidence that the Court had already \n     rejected in Garrett. Contrary to that assertion, the records \n     in the two cases, which appear to be similar, seem to contain \n     overwhelming evidence to support the Congressional findings.\n       Title II of ADA involved in Lane was supported by 13 \n     Congressional hearings and a special task force that had \n     gathered evidence from every state in the Union. Similarly, \n     Title I of ADA involved in Garrett was based on task force \n     field hearings in every state attended by more than 30,000 \n     people including thousands who had experienced discrimination \n     with roughly 300 examples of discrimination by state \n     governments.\n       Notwithstanding those findings, the Garrett Court \n     concluded:\n       ``The legislative record of the ADA, however, simply fails \n     to show that Congress did in fact identify a pattern of \n     irrational state discrimination in employment against the \n     disabled.''\n       Writing for four justices, Justice Breyer's dissent found \n     ample evidence to support the legislation noting:\n       ``Unlike courts, Congress can readily gather facts from \n     across the Nation, assess the magnitude of a problem and more \n     easily find an appropriate remedy.''\n       The dissent makes three more related points:\n       (1) ``Moreover, unlike judges, Members of Congress are \n     elected.''\n       (2) ``. . . The Courts do not `sit as a superlegislature to \n     judge the wisdom or desirability of legislative policy \n     determinations' '' and\n       (3) ``To apply a rule designed to restrict Courts as if it \n     restricted Congress' legislative power is to stand the \n     underlying principle--a principle of judicial restraint--on \n     its head.''\n       In imposing liability on the states in Lane, the Supreme \n     Court justifies abrogating the\n\n[[Page S10401]]\n\n     states' Eleventh Amendment immunity by enforcing fundamental \n     rights under the Fourteenth Amendment. To do that, under the \n     Court's reasoning, there must be ``a congruence and \n     proportionality'' between the injury and the remedy imposed. \n     That leaves the Court substantial latitude, as a matter of \n     interpretation, to declare acts of Congress unconstitutional \n     notwithstanding the enormous evidentiary support for \n     Congress' public policy determinations.\n       Justice Scalia's dissent in Lane attacked the ``congruence \n     and proportionality standard'' calling it a ``flabby test'' \n     and an ``invitation to judicial arbitrariness and policy \n     driven decision making.'' The dissent added:\n       ``Worse still, it casts this Court in the role of Congress' \n     taskmaster. Under it, the courts (and ultimately this Court) \n     must regularly check Congress' homework to make sure that \n     it has identified sufficient constitutional violations to \n     make its remedy constitutional and proportional. As a \n     general matter, we are ill advised to adopt or adhere to \n     constitutional roles that bring us into conflict with a \n     coequal branch of Government.''\n       Justice Scalia then carved out a new rationale for \n     disagreeing with the ADA's remedy, unmentioned when he joined \n     the majority three years earlier in Garrett, that the \n     Fourteenth Amendment applies only to state racial \n     discrimination and ``do not apply to this field of social \n     policy far removed from the principal object of the Civil War \n     amendments.''\n       My questions are:\n       (1) Aren't the ``congruence and proportionality standard'' \n     and Chief Justice Rehnquist's ``method of reasoning'' dictum \n     in Morrison examples of manufactured rationales used by the \n     Supreme Court to exercise the role of super legislature and \n     make public policy decisions which is the core Congressional \n     role under the Constitution?\n       (2) Without invoking the ``flabby test'' and engaging in an \n     ``invitation to judicial arbitrariness by policy driven \n     decision making'' embodied in the ``congruence and \n     proportionality standard,'' wouldn't a preferable test of \n     constitutionality be the standard applied by Justice Harlan \n     to the Commerce clause in Maryland v. Wirtz, and again \n     invoked in Gonzales v. Raisch:\n       ``But where we find the legislators . . . have a rational \n     basis for finding a chosen regulatory scheme necessary to the \n     protection of commerce, our investigation is at an end''?\n       (3) Isn't there a lack of respect for Congress demonstrated \n     by the Supreme Court as Justice Scalia points out that it is \n     ``ill advised'' for the Court to set itself up as \n     ``taskmaster'' to determine that Congress has done its \n     ``homework'' and to strike down Acts of Congress as Chief \n     Justice Rehnquist did in Morrison by impugning our ``method \n     of reasoning''?\n       (4) Using the maxim that ``hard cases make bad laws'', \n     should there be any place in the judicial decision-making \n     process to make allowances for the unique and sympathetic \n     factual situation in Lane where a paraplegic had to crawl up \n     the courthouse steps?\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Arlen Specter.\n\n       P.S. Following the release of my prior letter on the \n     Commerce Clause, there were misrepresentations that my \n     questions asked how you would have decided specific prior \n     cases. That is not true. The questions were carefully crafted \n     to elicit your thinking on your jurisprudence and judicial \n     philosophy as opposed to how you would have decided specific \n     cases.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. At this juncture, it might be appropriate to note that \nRepublicans have the floor until 2:30, and if one of my colleagues is \nto come over, I may speak a more abbreviated period of time, we will \nhave time for another speaker to take the floor before Senator Leahy is \nrecognized under the unanimous consent request at 2:30.\n  I asked Judge Roberts the questions which I had set forth in the \nletter that I referred to, What is an appropriate jurisprudential \nstandard on the commerce clause? Is it the one which has been followed \nfor so many years, which is a substantial basis for the congressional \ndecision, or is it some ``method of reasoning'' which is impossible to \nunderstand even in the context of a record from a task force in 21 \nStates and 8 separate reports to the Congress?\n  Judge Roberts declined to answer the question. I pressed him and \nfinally said we would have to agree to disagree. But it seems to me \nwhen you have a question about philosophy, about judicial approach, \nabout what is the proper standard to apply on constitutionality of a \ncongressional exercise of authority under the commerce clause, that is \nthe kind of question which should be answered, not sufficient to vote \n``no,'' but candidly the beginning of being a little bit tempting.\n  Then I asked him about the jurisprudence of the Supreme Court in the \ntwo cases I have already referred to under the Americans With \nDisabilities Act.\n  In Garrett v. Alabama, in the year 2001, the Supreme Court struck \ndown a title of the Americans With Disabilities Act which dealt with \ndiscrimination in employment involving Ms. Barrett, who had breast \ncancer. And then, 3 years later with an identical record--the records \nare the same in all titles of the Americans With Disabilities Act--you \nhad a striking case of a paraplegic, a case called Tennessee v. Lane, \nwhere the parapalegic had to crawl up the steps to a courtroom. The \nissue there was whether there was discrimination under the Americans \nWith Disabilities Act on access. The Supreme Court of the United \nStates, in a 5-to-4 decision, said that was constitutional.\n  It is inexplicable how, given two titles of the Americans With \nDisabilities Act with identical records, the Court could find one to be \nconstitutional and the other to be unconstitutional. I asked Judge \nRoberts about that. Again, he declined to answer.\n  The Supreme Court in both Garrett and Lane adopted a brand new \nstandard for testing constitutionality of congressional action under \nsection V of the 14th amendment as contrasted with the right of the \nStates for immunity from suit under the 11th amendment.\n  The Supreme Court of the United States picked up a doctrine which \nthey had adopted in a case called City of Boerne v. Flores. In 1997, \nwhen the Supreme Court overturned the Religious Freedom Restoration Act \nof 1993, legislation which had been very carefully considered by the \nCongress of the United States, the Supreme Court said that act was \nunconstitutional because it did not satisfy a test of congruence and \nproportionality. When I read that standard, I wondered what it meant. \nCongruence and proportionality. Where did the Court get this standard? \nThey plucked it right out of thin air. There was no basis for this kind \nof a standard.\n  Justice Scalia, in dissenting in the Lane case, said it was a \n``flabby test'' which was put into effect in order to allow the Supreme \nCourt to engage in policymaking decisions, in effect, judicial \nlegislation.\n  The dissenting opinion by Justice Scalia in the Lane case took the \nCourt to task for an ``ill-advised opinion'' where they acted as the \ntaskmaster of the Congress to see that the Congress was doing its \nhomework. Like the Supreme Court decision in Morrison attacking our \nmethod of reasoning, it seemed to me the Court had gone much too far in \nchallenging the competency of the Congress in striking down \ncongressional authority.\n  Again, I ask Judge Roberts, what about this test of congruence and \nproportionality? Does it have any basis in the law? Is there any \nrationality in what the Court did in these two cases under the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act? Again, he declined to answer.\n  After talking to a number of my colleagues, the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee will give very serious consideration to legislation which \nwould give the Congress standing to defend the constitutionality of the \nstatutes which it enacts. Standing is a very delicate subject and there \nare a great many cased where people seek to go to court to enforce the \nEndangered Species Act or to enforce a variety of laws. Congress has \nthe authority to grant standing.\n  It seems to me that it might be a good occasion for Congress to \nexercise this authority to grant standing to Congress. Why should we \nrely upon the litigants to defend the constitutionality of these \nenactments which we pass very carefully and very laboriously, as we did \nthe Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 or the Americans with \nDisabilities Act? That is a move which might have material implications \non reasserting the balance of power and the separation of power between \nCongress and the Court.\n  If we have standing, we can have our own counsel, we can proceed to \nbrief the cases, we can proceed to have someone argue it on our behalf. \nWe may be able to stop the flood of actions by the Supreme Court which \nhave reversed acts of Congress, the actions by an activist Court \nengaged in judicial legislation and doing it under the guise of \nillusory standards such as congruence and proportionality, standards \nplucked out of thin air. They disagree with our method of reasoning \nwhen there is no basis for asserting superiority of reasoning by the \nSupreme Court over the Congress.\n  When we talk about this judicial activism, we are talking about a \nform of\n\n[[Page S10402]]\n\nactivity which is abhorred by both the right and the left on the \npolitical spectrum. My distinguished colleague, Senator Hatch, who \npreceded me as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and I have \ndiscussed the decision of the Supreme Court in striking down the \nReligious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, and it is one which candidly \ndefies logic. But the Court decided to undertake that restriction of \ncongressional authority, and it did so in that case.\n  The issue of how many questions a nominee must answer will be before \nthe Senate again on the next nomination to replace retiring Justice \nSandra Day O'Connor. The refusal of nominees to answer questions where \nthe case is likely to come before the Court is, in my opinion, well-\nfounded.\n  Judge Roberts answered more questions than many. Justice Scalia, for \nexample, as I said, would not even comment on Marbury v. Madison. Judge \nRoberts did not answer questions where, in his judgment, the case was \nlikely to come before the Supreme Court. If the case is to come before \nthe Supreme Court, as a matter of judicial independence, the nominee \nought not to answer that question.\n  I said in advance of the hearings, and I said during the hearings, \nthat any Senator had a right to ask any question which he or she chose, \nincluding how a case would be decided, and that the nominee had the \nright to answer or decline to answer as the nominee chose, and that it \nwas my view that if a question did involve a question on a case likely \nto come before the Court, the nominee was within his rights to decline \nto answer.\n  The public does not understand the issue of judicial independence and \nthe ramifications of answering a question on a case likely to come \nbefore the Court. The public in the opinion polls wanted to know what \nJudge Roberts thought about a woman's right to choose. The public \nwanted to know whether he would uphold Roe v. Wade or overrule Roe v. \nWade.\n  It seems to me this is a classic case of the irresistible force \nmeeting the immovable object. The immovable object is judicial \nindependence--not to make a commitment in advance on a case likely to \ncome before the Court--and the sort of irresistible object is the \npublic interest in knowing.\n  During the course of the hearings on Judge Roberts, Senator after \nSenator was moving right into the area of wanting to know how Judge \nRoberts would decide a case. I pressed Judge Roberts on the issue of \nstare decisis and on the value he would place on precedent, on Planned \nParenthood v. Casey, on some 38 cases where the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States had an opportunity to overrule Roe and declined to do so. \nI asked him about a doctrine which had been articulated in some \nquarters about Casey being a superprecedent and took a step on coining \na new concept called the super-duper precedent. It has not landed too \nwell, but sometimes these new ideas take a while to gestate.\n  I believe the next nominee is going to face very close questioning. \nIt is my thought, already expressed by a number of Senators--and \nSenators on both the right and the left--that Senators want to know \nmore about the thinking of the new nominee than Judge Roberts was \nwilling to give.\n  Judge Roberts was able to run between the raindrops in a hurricane \nbecause of his unique talent; his record was so extraordinary that he \nwas able to fend off many questions. A number of Senators have stated a \nreason for a ``no'' vote is Judge Roberts' refusal to answer questions \nand their lack of sufficient knowledge as to where he stands.\n  It is a virtual certainty--in fact, you can strike ``virtual''--it is \na certainty that the next nominee will have these questions and many \nmore. Some would say that Judge Roberts would be replacing Chief \nJustice Rehnquist, so that when you have somebody perhaps on the same \nideological line, although that is by no means certain from Judge \nRoberts' answers, the fact is you just do not know how Judge Roberts is \ngoing to rule on Roe v. Wade or other controversial issues. Again, I \nrepeat, that is, in my opinion, as it should be as a matter of judicial \nindependence. If there is any rule as to what happens, it is a rule of \nsurprise as to what nominees do.\n  There is no doubt that the hearings in the Judiciary Committee have \nbecome more contentious because of concern about the highly \ncontroversial issues, and it is more than the issue of choice in Roe v. \nWade, it is the issue of congressional authority versus the action of \nthe Supreme Court in declaring laws unconstitutional. It is in the \nissue of religious freedom as embodied in the Religious Restoration Act \nwhere there is concern from both the right and from the left.\n\n  It was this kind of angst, this kind of unease which led me to the \nsuggestion that the President defer a replacement for Justice O'Connor \nuntil the end of the June term, at a point where we would know a great \ndeal more about Judge Roberts. But in the context where there are \nuncertainties as to two votes, it compounds the angst and anxiety as to \nwhat may occur.\n  I called Justice O'Connor, as I said in the meeting involving the \nPresident, Senator Frist, Senator Reid, Senator Leahy, the Vice \nPresident, Chief of Staff Andy Card, and myself. I said I called \nJustice O'Connor and asked her if she would be willing to stay on--\nobviously quite a sacrifice--and she said she would if she was asked. \nBut that is the President's call, and the President has indicated he is \ngoing to proceed in a timely manner where the expectation is the \nnomination will be made, my estimate would be, shortly if not \nimmediately after a decision is made by the Senate on the Roberts \nnomination.\n  It is going to be a contentious hearing. The contentious quality was \nbubbling just below the surface during the hearing of Judge Roberts. \nThere are a number of factors already stated, already articulated which \nwould pose even more of a contentious issue.\n  I ask unanimous consent, although I don't know if I need to, to \nintroduce a bill at this point, and it is right in line with the issues \ninvolved in the Roberts nomination. That is legislation that will call \nfor televising the Supreme Court of the United States.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is in order to introduce \nthis measure. It will be received and appropriately referred.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair.\n  The nomination of Judge Roberts to be Chief Justice has created a \ngreat deal of interest, and I think the televised hearings have \ncaptured the imagination of the American people. I have long believed \nthat the Court ought to be televised. There is a certain reluctance of \nthe Court for television as a change in practice and as a change in \nprocedure, but there is much to recommend it.\n  Televising the House of Representatives and the Senate has produced a \ngreat deal more public understanding on the important activities we \nundertake here and what we do.\n  The Supreme Court of the United States in 1980, in a case captioned \nRichmond Newspapers v. Virginia, set the rationale for televising the \nCourt when the Supreme Court itself said:\n\n       Instead of acquiring information about trials firsthand \n     observation or by word of mouth from those who attend, people \n     now acquire it chiefly through the print and electronic \n     media. In a sense, this validates the media claim of acting \n     as a service for the public. Media presence--\n\nThe intended subject here--\n\n     contributes to the understanding of the rule of law and the \n     comprehension of the function of the entire criminal justice \n     system.\n\n  That would be true for the entire justice system.\n  The Congress has the established authority to set the date when the \nSupreme Court starts its session. We have legislated that it should be \nthe first Monday in October. We have the authority to establish the \nnumber of Justices--nine. We all recall the famous court-packing effort \nby President Roosevelt in about 1937. We could increase the number as \nwe would choose. The Congress has the authority to establish a quorum, \nwhich is set at six for the Court to function. The Congress has the \nauthority to establish a timetable for the disposition of habeas corpus \ncases, capital punishment. We establish the timetable for the Federal \ncourts under the Speedy Trial Act. Of course, the final arbiter in all \nof these cases is the Supreme Court of the United States.\n  So if the Supreme Court should decide that legislation enacted by \nCongress to call for being televised was violative of the Constitution, \nthey would have the final word. But in the context where the Supreme \nCourt decides the cutting edge questions of our\n\n[[Page S10403]]\n\nday--the question of choice, the question of the right to die, the \nquestion of the Ten Commandments, the question of establishment of \nreligion, the question of the free exercise clause, the question of the \ndeath penalty, the question of exonerating the innocent--it is very \nmuch in the public interest, in my view, to have the Supreme Court \ntelevised.\n  We all know the momentous decision of the Supreme Court in Bush v. \nGore. On that occasion, when I walked across the green to attend the \nargument, the square block was overloaded with television trucks \nbecause of the enormous interest, but the television cameras could not \ngo inside. At that time, Senator Biden and I wrote to the Chief Justice \nand asked that the Court be open for television. We received a letter \nof declination. As I recollect, the Court did have a transcript which \nwas released right after the oral argument concluded.\n  I believe proceedings of the Court could be televised with due regard \nto the security and safety of the members of the Court. Under the \nproposed legislation, the Court would have the authority in a \nparticular case to stop the television if it felt it necessary.\n  In conclusion, as we approach the confirmation of Judge Roberts to be \nChief Justice, I urge my colleagues to take a close look at his record. \nThe conventional wisdom is that the nomination is assured at this \npoint. I believe that is true. Nevertheless, I think there is value in \nrolling up the score. We frequently cite the vote of 98 to 0 for \nScalia; only three votes against Justice Ginsburg; 52 to 48 for Justice \nThomas. I believe a strong vote for Judge Roberts would give him added \nstature. It is pretty hard to add stature to the Chief Justice of the \nU.S. Supreme Court, but I believe it would add a modicum of stature.\n  As the President ponders the nominee to replace Justice Sandra Day \nO'Connor, it is my hope that there will be balance maintained on the \nCourt. With the uncertainties of the vote of Judge Roberts, the \nuncertainties of the vote of a new nominee, and the prospects of \nretirements in the immediate future, the composition of the Court could \nchange, and the rule of law is structured on stability. The rule of law \nis structured on expectations being fulfilled, and reliance, and it is \nenhanced by not having sharp turns.\n  The nomination of Judge Roberts to replace Chief Justice Rehnquist \nmay work out to be a substitution of people with about the same \njudicial approach. Although it is far from certain exactly how Judge \nRoberts will rule, there is no doubt that Justice O'Connor was a swing \nvote, tipping the scale. I believe that is a factor to be considered.\n  While I would like to see more women, a Hispanic, and more African \nAmericans on the Court, I urge the President to name the very best \nperson he can find. We could use a Brandeis or a Holmes on the Supreme \nCourt. I am not saying we do not have one now, but if we do, we could \nuse more.\n  President Bush disarmed his critics by nominating Judge Roberts with \nhis extraordinary record, and I urge the President to nominate the very \nbest person he can, regardless of gender, ethnicity, or any other \nfactor.\n  I draw the attention of my colleagues to the full text of my remarks \nof Monday, September 19, 2005.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I appreciate the leadership of Senator \nSpecter in this confirmation process. We stayed on track and on time \nbetter than at any time I can remember. We had a lot of people with a \nlot of strong views and ideas they wanted to express and they were \ngiven plenty of time to do that. We had 30-minute rounds of questioning \nand then 20-minute rounds. Some got more who asked for it. Judge \nRoberts was appropriately forthcoming under certain circumstances and \nappropriately failing to be drawn into discussions of cases that may \ncome before him.\n  I think things went well. A lot of people doubted whether we would be \nin position to have a vote this week, but the Senator from Pennsylvania \nwas tireless. He stayed as long as it took. He listened to all of it, \nchaired the hearings, and kept us going straight, and made sure on \noccasion the witness had a chance to answer. Sometimes he was given \nmore questions and interruptions than he was given a chance to answer. \nThe Senator did a great job and I want to thank him for that.\n  I also join the Senator in saying that one never knows what a judge \nwill be confronted with 10, 12, 15, 20 years from now. We might as well \nget the best person we can get who can deal with those questions that \nare unanticipated now and who can construct a philosophy of the \njudiciary that will be healthy and faithful to the Constitution, to the \npeople who have ratified that Constitution, who have elected the \nrepresentatives, to be respectful of all of that, and who understands \nthe proper role of a judge.\n  I think Judge Roberts meets every one of those qualities. I think he \nis an extraordinary individual. Everyone who has been watching the \nhearings has been very impressed. I think he represents the American \nideal of what a judge should be. The President deserves great credit \nfor nominating the best.\n  I asked Professor Fried of Harvard, who is a former Solicitor General \nof the United States and had himself argued cases before the Supreme \nCourt--he is now at Harvard teaching philosophy of law--how would he \nrank Judge Roberts as an advocate before the Supreme Court, and he said \nthe best, as so have certain legal magazines that rate the best lawyers \nin the country.\n  I think the people like him. I think his idea that judges should show \nmodesty and be faithful to the Constitution, his expression that the \ngreatest threat to the Court could be judicial activism, where the \npeople feel the judges are not faithful to the Constitution and are \nimposing their political views on the people that are not required by \nthe Constitution, that this is a threat to the rule of law because at \nsome point in the future the Court may have to call on the American \npeople to do things they do not want to do, they may not be popular, to \nbe faithful to the Constitution. To erode and give away that good \nrespect the American people have for the courts and the law would be a \nmistake.\n  I want to express how strongly I feel that our nominee is an \nextraordinary individual. I saw on C-SPAN today John Roberts' former \ncoach and teacher, and he said he was the finest student we had in our \nschool and the finest student the school has ever produced. He did not \nhesitate to say that. He coached him in wrestling. He played football. \nHe was top academically in the class and cared about those kinds of \nthings. He worked hard and he was honest. He said, I remember when he \ncame up at graduation and they gave the award for the finest student in \nEnglish, it was John G. Roberts; they gave the one for French, and it \nwas John Roberts; in Latin, it was John Roberts; mathematics, it was \nJohn Roberts. He said nobody, none of the students, had the slightest \ndoubt that he deserved those honors and he earned them, because of both \nhis work and his intelligence.\n  John Roberts went to Harvard to do his undergraduate degree, finished \nHarvard in 3 years, not 4, and was magna cum laude on his graduation \nfrom Harvard in 3 years. Then he went to law school at Harvard, \nlikewise did exceedingly well, and was selected for Law Review, which \nis a great honor for a student in law school to be selected for the Law \nReview. I suppose some of us might grumble, but most people would \nprobably admit that the Harvard Law Review is the finest, most \nprestigious Law Review in the country. His fellow members of the Law \nReview elected him to be managing editor of the Law Review, which again \nis an affirmation of their respect for him and his abilities.\n  After law school, he clerked for Judge Friendly, one of the great \ncircuit judges in America. This is the court of appeals that is just \nbelow the Supreme Court. I note that outstanding law graduates apply \nfor these courts of appeal clerkships. There are not that many of them. \nThey are very coveted and only the best students are selected.\n  Judge Friendly, one of the great circuit judges in the last 50 years \nin the United States, would have been very competitive. Many students \nwould have liked to have clerked for him. He chose John Roberts.\n  After that, I am sure Judge Friendly recommended him--or however it \noccurred, he was recommended to Chief Justice Rehnquist. I believe \nJustice\n\n[[Page S10404]]\n\nRehnquist was not chief at that time but a justice on the Supreme \nCourt. He clerked for the Supreme Court, the very Court on which he \nwill now sit. Trust me, it is an honor for a lawyer to be chosen to \nclerk for the U.S. Supreme Court, because they want the very best young \nlawyers who can help them decide the most complex cases. So I think \nthat is something we should remember.\n\n  Then he is in private practice. He goes to the Department of Justice. \nHe is called over as part of Fred Fielding's efforts to bring the \nbrightest to the White House. He found him and snatched him away to the \nWhite House. He was White House counsel under President Reagan, helped \nPresident Reagan carry out his agenda, an agenda that 48 States \naffirmed when he was reelected by one of the largest votes in history.\n  Some have tried to say, oh, he worked in the Reagan White House. He \nwas conservative and out of the mainstream. President Reagan carried 48 \nStates. He was not out of the mainstream. We have some leftists in this \ncountry who are out of the mainstream, but I do not think because he \nworked in the Reagan White House anybody could suggest he is not a \nmainstream lawyer.\n  He later becomes principal Deputy Solicitor General in the Department \nof Justice. The Solicitor General represents the United States of \nAmerica before the Supreme Court. That is the job many lawyers call the \ngreatest lawyer job in the world, to be able to represent the United \nStates of America before the Supreme Court. That is a great honor. He \nwas the principal deputy. He argued cases there and in private \npractice. He has argued a total of 39 cases before the Supreme Court. I \nam sure there is no lawyer in America his age who has argued 39 cases \nbefore the Supreme Court. We have maybe a few lawyers in the Senate. I \nknow Jon Kyl has argued two cases before the Supreme Court. I doubt \nthere are any of us who have; maybe others who have done it. It will \nnot be me. But 39 means he is a professional practitioner before the \nSupreme Court, a student of the Supreme Court, so good that when anyone \nelse is preparing to make an argument for the Court, they want to have \na moot court practice before John Roberts because he knows how the \nCourt thinks, what the issues are, how the cases are handled.\n  I asked him to explain what a Chief Justice on the Court does and how \nthe Supreme Court works. He explained in great detail about how cases \nare tried in the trial courts, the U.S. district courts, how every word \nis written down. They have juries. They have lawyers who argue the case \nbefore the juries. The judge makes rulings on the law and the evidence. \nAfter the case is over, a transcript is prepared. If someone wishes to \nappeal, they do so, and they point out what in that record is in error \nand argue that the case should be reversed or some other remedy. They \ngo first to the court of appeals, such as where Judge Friendly served. \nWe have 11 circuit courts of appeal and the DC Circuit in the United \nStates. They review the record. The lawyers argue why this transcript \nproved a judge committed error or error occurred. They argue why the \ncase should be affirmed or not affirmed. They submit briefs on that, \nciting the record and the detailed facts, and why they believe their \nviews should be affirmed. It goes up that way. They have oral \narguments. Then the court of appeals judges meet, discuss it, and they \nrender a written opinion. Then if someone is not happy with that, they \ncan appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  All of this is already prepared before it gets to the judge. They \nhave oral arguments, and then they have briefs. Then friends of the \ncourt submit briefs and everybody can submit briefs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time reserved for the majority has \nexpired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask to have 1 minute to wrap up.\n  Mr. LEAHY. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. They meet with their fellow judges, they read the law \nand the transcripts, and they make a decision after all of that.\n  I asked him, isn't that why, Judge Roberts, you ought not to \nblithely, here in this Senate committee room, start expressing opinions \non cases when they have not had all the study in advance to clarify the \nissues?\n  He answered that yes.\n  Madam President, I see the distinguished ranking member of our \ncommittee, Senator Leahy. I will note he has worked hard to make sure \nthat every opportunity has been presented on his side. He had every \nquestion answered. He got extra time for people who wanted extra time. \nBut after hearing it all, I think he made the right decision in his \nchoice to vote for Judge Roberts. He was an effective advocate for his \nviews of his members and at the same time I think he made an \nindependent decision that I respect. I enjoyed working with him and I \nthink we did a pretty good job with these hearings--although my \ndaughter told me not long ago, she said: Daddy, it was pretty clear who \nthe brightest bulb in that room was, and it was not the Senators.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time from 2:30 \nuntil 3:30 p.m. will be under the control of the Democratic leader or \nhis designee.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, we are beginning our debate today on the \nRoberts nomination. We know the vote will not come today, but I urge \nMembers for him and against him to come and speak. I say that because \nthere are very few decisions we face here in the Senate that are as \nconsequential or as enduring as the one we face today. Few in our \nNation's history have served as Chief Justice of the United States. It \nis a unique and significant position. Once one assumes it, he or she \nholds it for life. To put that in perspective, we have had 43 \nPresidents. We have only had 16 Chief Justices of the United States.\n  I explained last week why I was supporting John Roberts's nomination \nto be Chief Justice. It was neither an easy decision nor was it a \nhurried decision. But it was a decision that my conscience led me \ntoward.\n  I thank Senators Reid, Kennedy, Kerry, Bingaman, Boxer, Pryor, Obama, \nNelson of Nebraska, and others for their thoughtful remarks these past \nfew days. I commend to the Senate each of the statements on both sides \nmade in the Judiciary Committee meeting on Thursday.\n  I must say, as the Democratic leader of that committee, I believe the \nDemocratic Senators distinguished themselves by the thoughtful manner \nin which they proceeded. The hearing record upon which the Senate can \ndraw in making this decision is as full as it is largely through their \ndiligence. Now each Senator has to carefully weigh this question and \ndecide it for himself or herself.\n  Regardless of how Senators decide to vote on this nomination, the \nDemocratic members of the Judiciary Committee can all be proud that we \nhave done our job, we have fulfilled our constitutional responsibility \nto fully, fairly, and openly review this nomination on its merits. For \nthat I thank them all.\n  I note that it is true that Democratic Senators are not all voting in \nlockstep. Each Senator individually gave this nomination serious \nconsideration. They each honored their constitutional duty and their \nobligation to the American people in reviewing this nomination.\n  Democratic Senators kept open minds throughout this process, unlike \nsome partisan cheerleaders who rallied to endorse the White House \ndecision long before the first day of hearings opened. I urged my \ncolleagues on this side of the aisle to wait until we had the hearings \nbefore they made a decision either for or against the nominee. I \nthought that was the most responsible thing for any Senator to do.\n  I have served in the Senate for more than 30 years, much of that time \non the Judiciary Committee. This is the 11th Supreme Court Justice \nnomination on which I cast my vote. I am one vote out of 100, but I \nrecognize that those 100 of us privileged to serve in the Senate are \nentrusted with protecting the rights of 280 million of our fellow \ncitizens. Just think for a moment, the Chief Justice is there to \nprotect the rights of all 280 million Americans. Only 101 Americans can \nhave a say in who is going to be Chief Justice: The President, of \ncourse, with the nomination, and then the 100 Members of the\n\n[[Page S10405]]\n\nU.S. Senate who have to stand in the shoes of 280 million Americans.\n  There is no entitlement to confirmation for lifetime appointments on \nany court or any nomination by any President, Democratic or Republican. \nAmericans deserve a Supreme Court that acts in its finest tradition as \na source of justice. The Supreme Court must be an institution where the \nBill of Rights and human dignity are honored, preserved, and protected.\n  As I considered this nomination, I reflected on the hearings and my \nmeetings with Judge Roberts. While I believe Judge Roberts should and \ncould have been more forthcoming, I was encouraged by some of his \nanswers to my questions both at the hearings and during our nearly 3 \nhours of face-to-face meetings.\n  I took Judge Roberts at his word when he gave the committee \nassurances that he would respect congressional authority. His steadfast \nreliance on the Supreme Court's recent Raich decision as significant \nprecedent, contravening further implications from Lopez and Morrison, \nwas intended to reassure us that he would not join in what has been a \ncontinuing assault on congressional authority. I heard him and I rely \non him to be true to the impression he created. To do otherwise would \ngreatly undermine Congress's ability to serve the interest of \nAmericans, to protect the environment, to ensure equal justice, and to \nprovide health care and other basic resources that are so vitally \nimportant to some of our neediest citizens. I think he knows that now.\n  I was also struck by Judge Roberts's admiration for Justice Robert \nJackson and for Justice Jackson's protection of fundamental rights, \nincluding the right of unpopular speech under the first amendment. We \nall know we don't have to fight to protect popular speech. It protects \nitself. We have to fight to protect unpopular speech under the first \namendment. Justice Jackson's protection of unpopular speech, and his \nwillingness to serve as a check on Presidential authority, are among \nthe finest actions by any Justice in our history.\n  I expect Judge Roberts to act in the tradition of Justice Jackson and \nserve as an independent check on the President. When he joins the \nSupreme Court, he can no longer simply defer to Presidential authority. \nWe know we are in a period in which the executive has had a complicit--\nand I believe compliant--Republican Congress that has not served as an \neffective check or balance. Without the Court to fulfill its own \nconstitutional role as check and balance, excess will continue; the \nbalance will be further tilted.\n  Justice Roberts said he went to law school because of his love of the \nlaw and the rule of law. I was struck by that comment. I was struck by \nit because it was the same thing that motivated me when I entered \nGeorgetown Law School here in this city. The purpose of the law is to \nserve justice. A Justice on our highest Court needs to know in his \ncore, in his entire being, that the words engraved in the Vermont \nmarble on the Supreme Court building are not just ``Under Law'' but \n``Equal Justice Under Law,'' and that under our great national charter \nit is not just the rule of law that a Justice must serve but the cause \nof justice. The rule is there so we can serve the cause of justice.\n  As Chief Justice, John Roberts will be responsible for the way in \nwhich the judicial branch administers justice for all Americans. I was \nencouraged that he said he would provide a fifth vote in staying an \nexecution when four other Justices voted to review a capital case. \nEffective judicial review is all the more important in an era in which \nso many innocent citizens have been sent to death row.\n  I respect those who come to different conclusions about this \nnomination. Actually, when I listened to those who came to different \nconclusions, I readily acknowledge the unknowable at this moment. \nPerhaps they are right and I am wrong. Only time will tell. But in my \njudgment, in my experience, especially in my conscience, I find it \nbetter to vote ``yes'' than ``no.'' My Vermont roots, which are deep \nand cherished in my family, have always told me to go with my \nconscience and that is what I have done in this decision.\n  Judge Roberts is a man of integrity. For me, a vote to confirm \nrequires faith that the words he spoke to us had meaning. I take him at \nhis word that he does not have an ideological agenda and that he will \nbe his own man as Chief Justice. I take him at his word that he will \nsteer the Court to serve as an appropriate check of potential abuses of \nPresidential power. I hope and trust he will.\n  This nomination process we complete this week provides some important \nlessons for the President as he renews his efforts to select a \nsuccessor to Justice O'Connor. Last week Chairman Specter--I might add, \nparenthetically, a chairman who ran a superb hearing in the best \ntradition of the Senate, making sure that both Republicans and \nDemocrats were heard and that questions were asked--and I, along with \nthe Republican and Democratic leaders of the Senate, met with President \nBush. I urged him to follow through with meaningful consultation this \ntime, to share with us his intentions, and to seek our advice before he \nchooses; to use both parts of the advice and consent clause of the \nConstitution.\n  I remain concerned by the administration's lack of cooperation with \nthe Senate on Judge Roberts's nomination. We did start off well with \nsome early efforts at consultation. I praised the President for that. \nBut then those early efforts didn't result in meaningful discussions.\n  The President's naming of Judge Roberts, first to replace Justice \nO'Connor and then swapping that for the vacancy left by Justice \nRehnquist, came as a surprise both to Republicans and Democrats, not as \na result of meaningful consultation. I believe there could and should \nhave been consultation with the Senate on the nomination of someone to \nserve as the 17th Chief Justice of the United States, and I am sorry \nthere was not. Many other Senators, including many Republican Senators, \nhave offered similar advice.\n  Chairman Specter has appropriately counseled that the next nominee \nshould be someone who promotes stability on the Court, much like \nJustice O'Connor. Senator Graham urged the President to listen to \nDemocrats and what we have to say as he considers his next nominee. \nWhat we are saying could easily be summed up by quoting the President's \ncampaign promise. We are asking him, in this case especially, to be a \nuniter, not a divider, for the sake of the country--not for the sake of \nthe 100 Senators but for the sake of the country.\n  I thought the White House did not help the Roberts nomination by \nwithholding information that has traditionally been shared with the \nSenate. The Administration treated Senators' requests for information \nwith very little respect for the constitutional role the Senate is \nexpected to fulfill in this process. Actually, the Administration \nstonewalled entirely the very narrowly tailored request for a very \nsmall number of important work papers from John Roberts's time as the \nprincipal political deputy to Kenneth Starr at the Solicitor General's \nOffice. This decision did not help the nominee. I suspect he could very \neasily have answered questions about those papers. But the choice was \ntaken out of his hands, and the choice was made at the White House.\n  That should not be allowed to establish a new standard because it \nwould override the precedent from Chief Justice Rehnquist's hearings \nand others. Previous Presidents have had the appropriate respect for \nthe constitutional process and worked with the Senate to provide such \nmaterials.\n  I urge the Administration to go back to precedent, to work with us \nand cooperate on future nominations.\n  Finally, some Republican Senators did not help the confirmation \nprocess by urging the nominee not to provide fuller answers during the \ncourse of the hearings.\n  I say that because, again, I remind all Senators, it would be the \nsame thing whether it was a Democratic President who made nominations. \nNo matter who makes the nomination, Democratic President or Republican \nPresident, we are the only 100 people in this country out of 280 \nmillion Americans who get to vote on the nomination and we should not \nstart off by asking a nominee or telling the nominee not to answer any \nquestions.\n  I can't imagine too many of our constituents would like that. I know \nthousands of questions were mailed in by Americans from all over who \nwould\n\n[[Page S10406]]\n\nhave liked to ask questions, and they could not be asked.\n  These hearings which we hold in the Senate are the best and only \nopportunity for the American people to hear from the nominee on \nimportant issues that affect all of us. The hearings we hold are the \nbest and only opportunity to hear directly from the nominee about his \nor her judicial philosophy.\n  The President asked for a dignified process and an up-or-down vote. \nThat is what we accomplished in the Judiciary Committee. With the \nSenate vote this week, we will complete our action and grant the \nSenate's consent. The hearings were dignified and they were fair. \nChairman Specter has every reason to be proud of what the committee \naccomplished under his leadership.\n  And I must say, I was personally very humbled by what the Democratic \nleader, Senator Reid, said about the senior Senator from Vermont this \nafternoon on the Senate floor. I appreciate hearing that from my dear \nfriend, Senator Reid.\n  With the benefit of lessons learned from this nomination, the \nPresident is facing a new opportunity to unite this country around a \nnominee to succeed Justice O'Connor.\n  I hope the President and those around him are listening this \nafternoon.\n  Now more than ever--with Americans fighting and dying in Iraq every \nday, with hundreds of thousands of our fellow Americans being displaced \nby disasters here at home--now more than ever is the time to unite \nrather than divide this Nation. The Supreme Court belongs to each and \nevery American, not to any political party or any faction. For our \ncountry's sake, for the sake of all Americans, no matter what their \npolitics might be, I urge the President to make a choice that unites us \nand doesn't divide us.\n  I will have more to say as the week goes on.\n  I see the distinguished Senator from Maryland in the Chamber. I yield \nto her such time as she may need.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Thank you, very much.\n  Madam President, I rise today to address one of the most significant \nand far-reaching decisions a Senator makes--the vote on the \nconfirmation of a Supreme Court Justice.\n  This vote will have an immense impact on current and future \ngenerations, because we are voting on a person who will lead the Court \nfor the next 20 years.\n  I compliment Chairman Specter and Ranking Member Leahy for the way \nthe whole process within the Senate was conducted.\n  I think we owe to the President, as well as to the nominee, a \ndignified process that focuses on intellectual rigor, substantive \ndiscussion, and plain good manners. I believe overall that process was \nindeed dignified and open.\n  This vote is crucial. A Senator is only called upon to make two \ndecisions in our career that are either irrevocable or irretrievable. \nOne is the decision to go to war. Once we vote to go to war, to put our \ntroops in harm's way, we cannot say a day later, Oops, we changed our \nminds or, 6 months later, cut off the money. Once they go, they go, and \nwe have to stick with them.\n  The other is the confirmation of members of the Supreme Court. Those \nare lifetime appointments, and they can only be removed for an \nimpeachable offense, to be tried here in the Senate.\n  So this decision is among the top two that we are called upon to \nmake.\n  We make budget decisions, and we can change it later. We make a \nlegislative decision--most of our legislation is for 3 years' \nauthorization we can always change it. But not this decision.\n  The people of Maryland have entrusted me with the right to make this \ndecision, and I take it seriously. I really pondered this and what I \nthought about this nomination. Two of my main questions were: No. 1, \nwhat will it mean for the fundamental constitutional liberties that has \nmeant so much to so many? And two, what will a Chief Justice Roberts \nmean to our future?\n  After a thorough and careful review of his record and his testimony, \nI must state now that I will oppose the confirmation of Judge Roberts \nto be the Chief Justice.\n  I do so because I have too many doubts about the direction a Roberts \nCourt will take us--persistent, nagging doubts about his positions on \nnondiscrimination, and the right of privacy in personal decisions, and \nin public policy.\n  On nondiscrimination, I just couldn't get to what his views were. Is \nit thorough? Is it broad? Is it narrow? On the issue of privacy, his \nviews sounded eerily like those of Clarence Thomas's that were given to \nreassure us, only to find that they are not what we heard.\n  On the issue of discrimination, I am looking at very specific issues \nsuch as the Voting Rights Act, Americans with Disability Act, title IX, \nwhich has meant so much to combat gender discrimination in education.\n  And, of course, on the right of privacy. What will this mean for \npersonal decisions related to a woman's reproductive choice, or public \npolicy in terms of where we are going to safeguard our records and \nsafeguard ourselves.\n  When I decided how I would vote on the nominee, I looked at three \nthreshold criteria: One, is the nominee competent? Second, is the \nnominee a man of integrity?\n  I believe every Senator knows, having both met Judge Roberts and from \nalso reviewing his background, he is competent. He is endorsed by the \nAmerican Bar Association. I also truly believe he is a man of personal \nintegrity.\n  But what about the nominee protecting core constitutional values and \nguarantees that are central to our system of government? I really do \nnot know the answer to this question.\n  Based on his writings and his testimony, as I said, I am left with \nthese persistent doubts about whether he will safeguard civil rights, \nthe right to privacy, and equal protection under the law.\n  I have approached this nomination very seriously. I have approached \nit with an open mind and an open door.\n  I have personally met with Judge Roberts. I found him to be very \nintelligent, to be very affable. Although he is personally appealing, \npersonal demeanor is not synonymous with personal philosophy. Personal \ndemeanor is not synonymous with judicial philosophy. It is not his \ndemeanor that we are voting on. We are voting on what will his judicial \nphilosophy mean to the Court, and particularly with his being its Chief \nJustice.\n  When I looked at the hearings, they occurred as I was moving my \nCommerce-State-Justice bill. I put in a couple of shifts, which I know \nthe Presiding Officer does as well--one shift being here in the Senate \nwith my colleague, Senator Shelby, getting an appropriations bill \nthrough, and then I would go home and do a second shift and watch the \nRoberts hearings on C-SPAN so that I could hear his words personally \nabout those answers.\n  Then, after listening to the hearings, I reviewed the testimony. I \nreviewed his writings and I also reviewed the testimony of others.\n  I was disappointed that we didn't have access to documents from 16 \ncases that he prepared while he worked for Solicitor General's office \nin the previous Bush administration, which would have given us insight, \neven though similar documents were given when Justice Rehnquist was \nnominated.\n  I tried to get insight into his legal reasoning and judicial \nphilosophy.\n  Is he smart? Yes. Is he experienced? Yes. As a young man, was he flip \nand a bit cheeky? The answer is yes. But put me in that column, too. I \nunderstand that. We all mature. But as we mature, we sometimes distance \nourselves from those remarks. Yet Judge Roberts did not distance \nhimself from those remarks.\n  I was puzzled by it. I did not quite understand it. I read and \npursued it further.\n  In the hearings, he had the opportunity to let us know whether he \nwould ensure personal rights, but he didn't clear up the uncertainty. \nHe didn't back away from his record and his writings. He wouldn't tell \nus if he shared the views of his clients. Again, he left too many \ndoubts about whether he will safeguard the rights that Marylanders and \nall Americans rely on each day.\n  He did say that he would follow the rule of law. I believe that. But \nyou\n\n[[Page S10407]]\n\nknow, coming to a decision in the Supreme Court, unlike the lower \ncourt, is not necessarily only following the law. It is not a \nmechanical decision. It is not like punching in a legal question, you \ngo to the 15 precedents and out comes the printout. This is \ninterpretation of the law at the highest level. And the Supreme Court \nhas the authority to create precedent, not only follow precedent.\n  So I couldn't get to where Judge Roberts was going. Take an example \nsuch as civil rights. One of the most important civil rights is the \nright to vote--cherished, fought for both through social movements and \nour wars. Yet Judge Roberts left me with serious doubts.\n  One of the most compelling testimonies during the hearing was that of \nCongressman John Lewis. He was a hero of the civil rights movement. He \nmarched side by side and hands on with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. When \nJohn Lewis speaks, we listen. He raised questions about whether Judge \nRoberts would support the basic guarantee of the Voting Rights Act, the \nlaw that ensures every citizen may vote and that there should be no \nbarriers, no publicly sanctioned barriers to participation in the \nvoting process. Yet as a young lawyer in the Reagan administration, \nRoberts held a very restrictive view.\n  John Lewis spoke about section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which is \nan important section because it seeks to remedy not only intentional \ndiscrimination and barriers to participation but also the effects of \ndiscrimination on under represented groups.\n  Judge Roberts held a very restrictive view, as I said. He argued that \nonly intentional discrimination violated the law.\n  If that argument prevailed, it would have made it impossible to \nchange discriminatory voting practices that stood in the way of African \nAmericans voting and holding elective office.\n  Let us take the poll tax, for example, a repugnant and despicable \npractice that has now been outlawed. The poll tax was a barrier that \nprevented African Americans from voting. But what could we do? Look at \none person at a time? No. Section 2 bars it, because it was a \ndiscriminatory practice that affected a whole group of people.\n  During the hearings, Judge Roberts could have clarified or changed \nhis views.\n  Yet he said nothing to distance himself from that very narrow \nlegalistic viewpoint that would have maintained barriers to \nparticipation, and we have no idea what principles he might apply to a \ncase that would come before the Court like, for example, on the so-\ncalled voter verified paper trail. We do not know today where he stands \non such important voting rights issues.\n  Now to disability rights. He left doubts about whether he would \nprovide disabled Americans with guarantees under the law for equal \nopportunity, particularly to education. Again, going back to being that \nlawyer in the Reagan administration, he wrote a memo attacking a \nFederal court decision that would have provided a deaf child with \nlearning tools. He thought this was too burdensome on the local school \nsystem, local government and, therefore, the State. He believed that \nStates should not be required to provide these same equal opportunities \nto handicapped children and that the burden it placed on the states had \nto be evaluated. He called the lower court's decision an activist one.\n  What would this mean for disabled children? What would this mean for \nhis interpretation of the Americans with Disabilities Act? This raises \ndoubts for me as to if he would apply a cost-benefit analysis to other \nareas of discrimination. Certainly when we look at disability and the \nequal opportunity or an opportunity for education, we have to look at \nthe benefit, not at the cost.\n  And now title IX. That has changed the face of American scholarships \nand of American sports. Title IX, for those who might not be familiar \nwith it, prevents gender discrimination in education. It says that \nschools that receive Federal funds can't treat men and women \ndifferently. That means there has to be parity--not sameness but \nparity--in the number of sports programs, access to classes, and \nopportunities for scholarships. That meant there had to be girl's \nsoccer teams at college just like there were boy's football teams; that \nthere had to be girl's lacrosse just like there was boy's lacrosse.\n  Let's take a look at what that has meant. It was phenomenal. All of a \nsudden, girls were getting scholarships for basketball, for playing \nlacrosse, and for playing soccer. Aren't we proud of what we have done? \nWe can only look at the Olympics and see our so-called ``all star'' \nbasketball team lost to Puerto Rico, but our girl's team brought home \nthe gold. People such as soccer player Mia Hamm passed the torch to the \nnext generation, which will go on and win the gold and give us such \nhonor. That is what title IX meant. It meant if you wanted to go to \nschool and sports was your thing, you would not be restricted because \nyou were a girl.\n  In his writings, Judge Roberts argued that the only part of the \nschool receiving direct Federal aid but not the whole school would not \nhave abided by title IX protection. That would have meant schools could \ndiscriminate in their athletics or scholarships even when another part \nof the school got federal funds. In his testimony, he did nothing to \nback away from this view.\n  What would the Roberts Court mean to millions of girls who now have \naccess to scholarships? What would this mean to thousands of girls who \nright now this afternoon are heading for practice in middle school, \nworking at it in high school, and ready to go? In my own home State, we \nare known for producing Olympic gymnastics stars, primarily out of \nMontgomery County, stars such as Dominique Dawes. Right now at that gym \nin Montgomery County are young girls working to either be able to go on \nto the Olympics, or if they do not make the Olympic team, on to make \nthe college team. We should never close the door to that kind of heart \nand soul and hard work because of gender. Where would the Roberts Court \nbe on that? Would he close that door? I am not so sure. That is why I \ncome back to these nagging doubts.\n  Finally, in the area of the constitutional, protected right to \nprivacy, I appreciate Judge Roberts speaking on the right to privacy. \nHe certainly said more on it than some other nominees have. Yet what he \nsaid does not tell us what he thinks about how far the right of privacy \nextends. He said he supported Griswold. Griswold upheld the right of \nmarried couples to buy contraception. Connecticut banned the sale of \ncontraception to married couples. So under the right of privacy, the \nSupreme Court said that if you are married, you have the freedom to buy \nfamily-planning mechanisms.\n  In many of his answers, he sounded as if he was assuring members that \nthe right of privacy is settled law, stating that ``I believe in \nprecedent,'' et cetera. But many of these answers sounded like Clarence \nThomas, eerily like Clarence Thomas. Thomas said there is a \nconstitutional right to privacy. He did not say how he would apply it \nto the most personal choices or what it would mean to public policy. \nSince Clarence Thomas has gone to the Supreme Court, we know he does \nnot quite follow what we thought he was assuring us he would. In fact, \nI don't know if Judge Thomas really supports the right of privacy in \nthe Constitution.\n  Roberts followed the same script. He refused to clarify his previous \ndismissal of Roe v. Wade, nor would he elaborate on what the right to \nprivacy includes. What would that mean to the future of reproductive \nrights? What would that mean to privacy rights in general?\n  This is important because I am voting not only about today, I am \nvoting about tomorrow. If Mr. Roberts is confirmed at age 50, he will \nbe on the Court for the next 20 or more years. And we wish him good \nhealth. But just think how profoundly society has changed with the \ninternet and information technology. Where we were 20 years ago. Where \nwas the Internet 20 years ago? We did not have laptops; laptops were \nbig boxes. What about 30 years ago? What was the computer? They were \nbig machines in big warehouses.\n  Twenty years ago, we would not have thought about privacy rights in \nthis context. But now, because of the Internet and computerization, we \nthink about all the issues related to our right of privacy. Think how \nthey can plunge in with your financial records, your medical records, \nthe so-called data-\n\n[[Page S10408]]\n\nmining where they know everything about you and find out all your \nmoves. Who do you want to have access to that? Who do you want to \nprotect your basic rights?\n  What will technology mean 20 years from now? What will that \ntechnology mean in terms of right of privacy? How do we need to protect \nour privacy?\n  Today have a national debate on privacy, the right for security of \nour country versus our own personal privacy. The right of search. The \nright, literally, of intrusion in our records. The PATRIOT Act would \ngive us some sets of rules; the ACLU would frown on others. It is \nlikely many of these decisions will go to the Supreme Court. Where will \nthose decisions be made? They have to be made to serve the national \ninterest but also to serve the principles of the Constitution. I am not \ndictating what the decision should be, but I can dictate who I want on \nthe Supreme Court to listen to that delicate balance between preserving \nthe security needs of our country with one's ability to be left alone \nfrom the intrusions of government.\n  How would Judge Roberts apply the right of privacy in a world where \nall our most personal health and financial records can be easily stored \nand shared?\n  So here we are now at this decision point. As I have looked at this, \nI have too many doubts about what Judge Roberts will mean for the \nSupreme Court--caused by what he said and what he didn't say. I believe \nthe American people were entitled to know what he thinks. The American \npeople are entitled to know if judge Roberts will be a protector of \ntheir most basic and fundamental rights. I would have been more \ncomfortable if in any way he would have said how he was different from \nthat young, cheeky lawyer trying to write up attention-getting briefs. \nSomething that would have moved him to say: Oh, that was my client, not \nme. I never wanted him to say how he would rule on cases in the future \nor any pending before the Court. But I would have liked to have known \nwho is this man for whom I am voting. What he believes is what he is \nand it will shape the Supreme Court for the next 20 years.\n  Several times, I came right up to the threshold. As I said, there are \nmany magnetic aspects about the Roberts nomination, but at the end of \nthe day and after careful review, I have too many doubts about his \ncommitment to nondiscrimination, the right of privacy, and equal \nprotection under the law. So when my name is called for this \nnomination, I will vote no.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for a few minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Dorgan are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, the time from 3:30 to 4:30 will be under \nthe control of the majority.\n  The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak to the nomination of \nJudge John G. Roberts, Jr. to be the next Chief Justice of the United \nStates of America. After a careful and considered review of his \ntestimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, his overall record, \nand a personal meeting with Judge Roberts in July, I have concluded \nthat Judge John Roberts should be confirmed as the 17th Chief Justice \nof the United States.\n  I first want to express my deepest gratitude to my good friend and \ncolleague, Senator Specter, who--as Chair of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee--was extraordinary in leading the nomination process to fill \nthe first Supreme Court vacancy in 11 years, the longest such interval \nsince the administration of President James Monroe 181 years ago. \nTogether with Ranking Member Leahy, Senator Specter ensured a thorough, \nrigorous, and civil examination of the individual who now comes before \nthe full Senate for a confirmation vote.\n  I have not arrived at my decision lightly. It has been said that, of \nall the entities in government, the Supreme Court is the most closely \nidentified with the Constitution and that no other branch or agency has \nas great an opportunity to speak directly to the rational and moral \nside of American character, to bring the power and moral authority of \ngovernment to bear directly upon the citizenry.\n  The Supreme Court passes final, legal judgment on many of the most \nprofound social issues of our time. The Court is uniquely designed to \naccept only those cases that present a substantial and compelling \nquestion of Federal law, cases for which the Court's ultimate \nresolution will not be applied merely to a single, isolated dispute \nbut, rather, will guide legislatures, executives, and all other courts \nin their broader development and interpretation of law and policy.\n  In the end, ours is a government of both liberty and order, State and \nFederal authority, and checks and balances. The remarkable challenge of \ncalibrating these fundamental balance points is entrusted, ultimately, \nto the nine justices of the Supreme Court of the United States.\n  To help meet the extraordinary challenges of this role, any nominee \nfor the Court must have a powerful intellect, a principled \nunderstanding of the Court's role, and a sound commitment to judicial \nmethod.\n  Moreover, the nominee for Chief Justice must also, among other \nleadership skills, engender collegiality and respect among all of the \njustices in order to facilitate the consensus of majority, command the \nrespect of lower Federal courts, and faster cooperation with the \nStates' highest courts. And the nominee must have a keen understanding \nof, and a disciplined respect for, the great and tremendous body of law \nthat precedes them to warrant our consent.\n  These are the threshold qualifications against which a person chosen \nby the President of the United States to serve as just the 17th Chief \nJustice of the United States must be measured. And all the more so when \nour Nation would undoubtedly bear the mark of the nominee for decades \nto come.\n  Indeed, given the age of this particular nominee, it is not \nunreasonable to conclude that John Roberts may indeed serve longer than \nChief Justice Marshall, who--with his 34 year tenure--still stands as \nour longest serving Chief Justice. If confirmed, Judge Roberts could \nwell directly impact the Nation for a half century and for decades \nbeyond. He would conceivably be entrusted with the ``care of the \nconstitution'' for the next 40 years.\n  It is against the backdrop of this reality that we also evaluate the \nrecord of Judge Roberts. And from a professional standpoint, it is \nclear that Judge John Roberts is one of the most highly-qualified \nindividuals ever to be nominated for the Supreme Court, given his \nexperience clerking for both the Second Circuit Court of Appeals and \nthe Supreme Court, and serving as counsel to a President, Attorney \nGeneral and Solicitor General and given he is one of the most respected \nlawyers in the Nation who has argued 39 cases before the Supreme Court \nand currently serves on the second highest court in the land with \nunanimous consent of this Chamber just a few years ago. So I applaud \nthe President for selecting an individual who indisputably possesses \nthe professional credentials to serve as Chief Justice.\n  Concurrently, however, I believe there are four additional threshold \nqualifications that are critical to assess and evaluate the nominee. \nThey are judicial temperament, integrity, methodology, and philosophy, \nand by their nature, are more challenging to measure. That is why I \nhave arrived at my conclusions based on a thorough analysis of the \ncomplete and accumulated record accompanying Judge Roberts's \nnomination.\n\n[[Page S10409]]\n\n  With regard to the matter of judicial temperament, the members of the \nJudiciary Committee rightly and vigorously questioned the nominee on \nthe tone and content of memoranda he authored as counsel to the Reagan \nadministration in the 1980s.\n  Because these memos presented opinions on such critical issues as \ncivil rights, the right to privacy, and gender equity--including a 1984 \nmemorandum regarding a letter I initiated as a member of the U.S. House \nof Representatives requesting the Administration not to intervene in a \nFederal court decision on the matter of women receiving lower pay \nbecause they often work in different jobs than men--I would have \nwelcomed a more direct and forceful refutation of these documents.\n  At the same time, Judge Roberts did testify that, ``Of course gender \ndiscrimination is a serious problem. It's a particular concern of mine \n. . . and always has been. I grew up with three sisters, all of whom \nwork outside the home. I married a lawyer who works outside the home. I \nhave a young daughter who I hope will have all of the opportunities \navailable to her without regard to any gender discrimination . . .''\n  Further, when probed about memoranda on vital civil rights issues, \nJudge Roberts's stated to the committee that he believes Congress has \nthe power to guarantee civil rights for all Americans.\n  As an example, when he was asked, ``Do you believe that the Court had \nthe power to address segregation of public schools on the basis of the \nEqual Protection Clause of the Constitution?'', Roberts responded, \n``yes''. And when questioned by Senator Kennedy, John Roberts agreed \nwith the approach taken by Justice O'Connor in upholding an affirmative \naction program within a university's admissions policy.\n  With regard to the right to privacy, in responding to concerns that \nhe characterized this fundamental right as a ``so-called right to \nprivacy'' in one Reagan administration memorandum, Judge Roberts \ntestified that he does believe the Constitution guarantees such a \nright, that he was representing the administration's views in his \nmemorandum, and he elaborated that this right emanates from at least \nfive different sources--the first, third, fourth, fifth, and fourteenth \namendments--with the due process clause of the 5th and 14th amendments \napplying substantively as well as procedurally with respect to the \nright to privacy.\n  To quote Judge Roberts: ``There's a right to privacy to be found in \nthe liberty clause of the 14th Amendment. I think there is a right to \nprivacy protected as part of the liberty guarantee in the due process \nclause. It's protected substantively.'' And specifically, he testified \nthat he ``agree[d] with the Griswold Court's conclusion that marital \nprivacy extends to contraception'' and agreed with the later Eisenstadt \ndecision that confirmed this right for unmarried couples as well.\n  And finally in regard to the qualification embodied by judicial \ntemperament, Judge Roberts offered the committee that some of the \nmemoranda in question owed their content to a more youthful discretion \nsome 25 years ago and that others merely reflected the views of his \nclients.\n  In the end, whatever one takes from the universe of exchanges before \nthe committee, I have concluded that the combination of this testimony \nwith the judge's current reputation among lawyers and peers for \ndiscretion, modesty, and humility is the more accurate and \ncontemporaneous measure of the man whose name stands before us today.\n  And that conclusion is buttressed by an examination of another of the \nthreshold qualifications--judicial methodology--which directly reflects \na judge's commitment to the essential tenets of fairness and judicial \nintegrity.\n  In making this assessment, it is most instructive to consider the \nemphasis Judge Roberts has placed on judicial process in adjudicating \ncases. Rather than a ``top down'' approach wherein a decision is made \nand then the opinion is written to support that position, Judge Roberts \nhas espoused a ``bottom up'' approach to decision-making--meaning that \nhe will work through the specific facts and law of each case, and then \narrive at a conclusion based on that analysis.\n  As regards judicial integrity, I believe we can all agree it is \nabsolutely essential that a judge be fair and open minded. Our citizens \nsimply must have confidence that a judge who hears their legal claims \ndoes not do so with a closed mind.\n  A judge must be truly committed to providing a full and fair day in \ncourt, and to arriving at decisions based on the facts and applicable \nlaw, not on any personal agenda or ulterior motive. For it is when the \nlatter occurs that the public justifiably loses faith in the \nindependence and fairness of our courts.\n  I conclude that no such faith should be lost here with Judge Roberts. \nHe is, by all accounts, a man of sound character whose integrity is \nwidely respected by Democratic and Republican lawyers alike.\n  To illustrate the essence of his judicial integrity, I recall during \nthe course of our meeting in July that he indicated it was not uncommon \nfor him to author an entire legal opinion before reaching the \nconclusion that the reasoning was wrong leading him to a different \ndecision.\n  He also spoke at length about his year as a law clerk to the late \nJudge Henry Friendly of the Second Circuit, one of the most respected \nlegal minds of our time, and a mentor and legal role model for Judge \nRoberts.\n  He recounted how Judge Friendly was assigned the duty of writing an \nopinion for the three judge panel that heard a certain case. But once \nJudge Friendly began trying to write what was supposed to be the \nmajority opinion, he realized that the reasoning behind the ruling \nsimply was not sound.\n  So after a number of failed attempts, Judge Friendly finally \ncirculated a folder to each of this colleagues containing two opinions, \nwith this note attached,--``The first opinion fulfills my obligation \nfor writing the majority opinion. The second is my dissent in the \ncase.'' Judge Friendly's ``dissent'' was so persuasive that it \nultimately became the majority opinion.\n  Again, this is reflected in Judge Robert's approach that is \ndemonstrated in his methodical writings and decisions.\n  While serving on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals between 2003 and \n2005, John Roberts wrote opinions in 49 of 169 cases. And his final \nrulings in those 49 cases bear the very balance of his analysis. For \nexample, he has ruled both for and against the government, both for and \nagainst corporations, and both for and against labor unions.\n  Moreover, he has shown a capacity for consensus, writing separately \nin only 7 of the 169 cases before the Circuit Court. This record of \ncollegiality would bode well for the current Supreme Court which can \nbenefit from more consensus opinions.\n  And of the 49 opinions Judge Roberts authored, only seven were \nappealed to the Supreme Court and all seven were denied. Again, all of \nthese facts stand in testament to the meticulous methodology and the \n``bottom up'' approach followed by Judge John Roberts.\n  I recognize that some believe that the fourth and final threshold \nqualification I referenced--the matter of judicial philosophy--should \nbe a factor for Presidents, but it should not be one the Senate \nconsiders in its confirmation process. I respectfully disagree.\n  In my view, the Senate must also consider the nominee's sense of the \nlimits and horizons of the great promises of our Constitution, and of \nthe nominee's specific view of the proper role of the Supreme Court in \ndeciding whether to take such cases and, if so, the method used to rule \nupon them.\n  The inquiry into Judge Roberts' judicial philosophy assumed \nparticular significance for all of us who value the Court's landmark \nrulings. Decisions protecting the rights of privacy, of civil rights, \nand of women seeking equal protection in the workplace--just to name a \nfew--comprise an important and settled body of the Court's case law.\n  Entire generations of Americans have come to live their lives in \nreliance upon the Court's rulings in these key areas, and overruling \nthese precedents would simply roll back decades of societal advancement \nand impose substantial disruption and harm.\n  Therefore, central to the question of a nominee's judicial philosophy \nis his views on one of the cornerstones of jurisprudence, and that is, \njudicial precedent. Because it was once said--by a\n\n[[Page S10410]]\n\nProfessor Walter Murphy--the Court is bound by the ``wisdom of the \npast, not the free choice of the present.''\n  On this vital matter, John Roberts has firmly stated to me his belief \nthat precedent plays a crucial role in the judicial process, and the \nfact, a precedent has been directly challenged and upheld deserves \nrespect from the Court.\n  In the course of our July meeting, John Roberts expressed to me that \njudges must keep in mind that they are not the first ones to address \nmost legal issues that arise, and that stability in the law is key to \nmaintaining the legitimacy of the courts. When I solicited his thoughts \nwith respect to, Chief Justice Rehnquist's decision in the Dickerson \ncase to uphold the Miranda decision even as the Chief Justice Rehnquist \nopposed Miranda itself, John Roberts concurred with the Chief Justice's \nprincipled deference to the doctrine of precedent.\n  As Judge Roberts later indicated to the judiciary committee:\n\n       I do think that it is a jolt to the legal system when you \n     overrule a precedent. Precedent plays an important role in \n     promoting stability and evenhandedness . . . It is not enough \n     that you may think the prior decision was wrongly decided.\n\n  Furthermore, Judge Roberts is on record stating that nothing in his \npersonal beliefs, including his religion, would prevent him from \nfaithfully applying the laws of our land. As well, he indicated that \nnothing in his personal views would prevent him from applying Supreme \nCourt precedent as governed by the doctrine of stare decisis.\n  Thus, he acknowledged the crucial interest by the doctrine of stare \ndecisis to promote stability and predictability, and therefore respect \nfor the law. This commitment to stare decisis takes on, of course, a \nspecial significance for this issue of privacy that I and so many \nAmericans accept and embrace as a basic and established right. So, \nessentially, with regard to a landmark case such as Roe v. Wade, Judge \nRoberts has outlined the process he would apply in reviewing such a \nchallenge.\n  Specifically, Judge Roberts explained, that, in essence, Roe is \nbuffered by the Casey decision, which affirmed the essential holding of \nRoe and therefore serves as the more immediate precedent of the Court.\n  And he responded to Senator Specter that Roe is ``settled as a \nprecedent of the court, entitled to respect under principles of stare \ndecisis. And those principles, applied in the Casey case, explain when \ncases should be revisited and when they should not. And it is settled \nas a precedent of the court, yes.''\n  Mr. President, given the totality of the record before us, I have \nconcluded from his testimony regarding both his judicial methodology \nand his judicial philosophy that Judge Roberts is not predisposed to \noverturning the settled precedent represented by Roe. Obviously, none \nof us can know with certainty how Judge Roberts would vote on any \nparticular case. But we can assess his methodology and analysis in \napproaching cases, based on his responses to questions posed by the \ncommittee throughout this confirmation process.\n  Finally, in meeting with Judge Roberts, I also expressed my view that \nJustice Sandra Day O'Connor's approach on the Court epitomizes a \ncritical nexus between the decisions of the United States Supreme Court \nand the ``real world'' impact of those decisions on the lives of the \nAmerican people. As Justice Frankfurter once wrote, the most \nfundamental questions that arise from the Constitution are decided \n``not from reading the Constitution but from reading life.''\n  That sense of perspective will be critical in fulfilling the enormous \nresponsibility Judge Roberts will have serving as Chief Justice. And \nJudge Roberts has indicated in compelling terms that his approach is to \nstand back and consider the larger implications of any future ruling \nand I would encourage him to continue with that model on the Court.\n  It is not an exaggeration to suggest that Judge John Roberts has the \npotential to become one of the preeminent Chief Justices in modern \ntimes.\n  Of course, no Member of this body can forecast with 100 percent \naccuracy the shape of the Supreme Court under John Roberts. \nNonetheless, in evaluating the universe of the threshold qualifications \nI have outlined, the entirety of the legal and judicial record \nregarding Judge Roberts points to a fair minded judge with deep respect \nfor the rule of law, the independence of the courts, and the judicial \nmethod . . . a judge committed to stability in the law, and to the \nestablished judicial principles for reviewing and upholding precedent.\n  There is little doubt that Judge John Roberts will have the \nopportunity to author a legacy for America that will reverberate for \nthe ages. After intensive examination, it is my conclusion that the \ntotality of the record before us, has earned him the privilege of \nwriting that legacy as the next Chief Justice of the United States. \nThank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, the Constitution gives us a solemn duty \nwhen it comes to the confirmation of an individual to sit on the U.S. \nSupreme Court. While the President is to nominate that individual, it \nis our duty in the Senate to decide whether to provide our consent.\n  When it comes to whether Judge John Roberts should be the 17th Chief \nJustice of the United States, I have little trouble providing mine. \nJudge Roberts is one of the most accomplished legal minds of his \ngeneration. He has argued 39 separate cases before the U.S. Supreme \nCourt, and he served with great distinction for 2 years on the Court of \nAppeals for the District of Columbia. He is certainly an eloquent \nspokesman for the rule of law, and he has received a ``unanimously well \nqualified'' rating from the American Bar Association, a rating that \nspecifically addresses his openmindedness and freedom from bias and \ncommitment to equal justice under the law.\n  I will vote to confirm Judge Roberts. I encourage my colleagues to do \nthe same.\n  I think it might be helpful for us to consider this afternoon what we \nhave learned about Judge Roberts over the past several months.\n  First, we have learned something about his judicial philosophy. \nJudges should not make policy. They don't pass laws or implement \nregulations. Instead, in the words of Justice Byron White, judges \nsimply decide cases, nothing more. Judge Roberts embodies this \nphilosophy.\n  During our hearing in the Judiciary Committee, he told us:\n\n       The role of the judge is limited. A judge is to decide the \n     cases before them. They are not to legislate. They are not to \n     execute the laws.\n\n  Time and again he repeated his belief that judges should play a \nlimited and modest role. During the confirmation hearings, he said this \nto Senator Hatch, Senator Grassley, Senator Graham, Senator Cornyn, and \nSenator Kohl. He told Senator Kyl:\n\n       Judges and Justices do not have a side in these disputes. \n     Rather, they need to be on the side of the Constitution.\n\n  Judge Roberts explained his philosophy clearly and, yes, in plain \nEnglish without using fancy words or resorting to long dissertations. \nBy the end of last week, there was little doubt where Judge Roberts \nstood.\n  He believes that judges play a limited and modest role and, to use \nhis own words, ``judges and Justices are servants of the law, not the \nother way around.''\n  Second, over the past several months, we have learned that the \nAmerican people share our view that Judge Roberts will be fair, \nopenminded, and modest as Chief Justice. We need to look no further \nthan the editorial pages of America's papers to know that Judge Roberts \nhas broad support.\n  The Los Angeles Times put it bluntly:\n\n       It will be a damning indictment of petty partisanship in \n     Washington if an overwhelming majority of the Senate does not \n     vote to confirm John G. Roberts, Jr., to be the next Chief \n     Justice of the United States. As last week's confirmation \n     hearings made clear, Roberts is an exceptionally well-\n     qualified nominee, well within the mainstream of American \n     legal thought, who deserves broad bipartisan support. If a \n     majority of Democrats in the Senate vote against Roberts, \n     they will reveal themselves as nothing more than self-\n     defeating obstructionists.\n\n  The Washington Post has offered a similar sentiment:\n\n       John G. Roberts, Jr., should be confirmed as Chief Justice \n     of the United States. He is overwhelmingly well qualified, \n     possesses an\n\n[[Page S10411]]\n\n     unusually keen legal mind and practices collegiality of the \n     type an effective Chief Justice must have. He shows every \n     sign of commitment to restraint and impartiality. Nominees of \n     comparable quality have, after rigorous hearings, been \n     confirmed nearly unanimously. We hope Judge Roberts will \n     similarly be approved by a large bipartisan vote.\n\n  Papers from my home State of Ohio have also given Judge Roberts their \napproval. The Akron Beacon Journal, a paper that endorsed Al Gore in \n2000, and then John Kerry in 2004, called Roberts ``supremely \nqualified.'' They went on to write:\n\n       Judge Roberts is eminently qualified. He has a sharp mind, \n     a sound temperament, and a keen understanding of the \n     collegiality required to run an effective Supreme Court.\n\n  According to the Cleveland Plain Dealer:\n\n       In selecting a leader for the U.S. courts, intellect and \n     probity are far more important than predictable political \n     philosophy. In the instance of John Roberts, it is difficult \n     to find, even among his most committed opponents, anyone who \n     will deny his intellectual superiority. His ethics are \n     unimpeached. He is, by all measures, a fair mind. There is no \n     reason to doubt that he will make an outstanding Chief \n     Justice.\n\n  The Dayton Daily News described Judge Roberts in straightforward \nterms:\n\n       Ya gotta like the guy. Judge John Roberts' 3-day appearance \n     before the Senate was impressive. Facing a Judiciary \n     Committee full of people who obviously consider themselves \n     expert on constitutional issues, he displayed mastery. He was \n     familiar with just about any case the Senators could name. He \n     discussed not only their main thrusts, but their nuances. His \n     decency was as unmistakable as his brilliance and diligence. \n     He bears no ill will toward any group that Democrats in the \n     Senate are concerned about--minorities, women, working \n     people, handicapped people, the poor.\n\n  These sentiments in these papers are certainly echoed by many of my \nconstituents. For instance, Eric Brandt from Pataskala, OH, wrote in \nstrong support of Judge Roberts:\n\n       The citizens of this State and country deserve a fairminded \n     jurist who does not use the power of the bench to usurp the \n     elected voice of the people.\n\n  Robert Hensley from College Corner, OH, made a similar point:\n\n       I believe it is imperative we have judges who rule \n     according to our Constitution and not their own beliefs and \n     ideas. I believe John Roberts is such a man.\n\n  And Al Law from Perrysburg, OH, had this to say:\n\n       We need prudent jurists who understand the proper role of \n     the court, and [Judge Roberts] is such a man.\n\n  Clearly, these citizens saw what we saw during the hearings last \nweek. Judge John Roberts is a modest, decent, and fair man who actually \nfully understands the limited role that judges should play in our \nconstitutional system of government.\n  Finally, over the past few months, we have heard from those \nindividuals who really know John Roberts the best. His colleagues in \nthe bar, Democrats and Republicans alike, have overwhelmingly supported \nJudge Roberts' elevation to the Supreme Court.\n  As I mentioned earlier, the American Bar Association has given Judge \nRoberts a rating of ``unanimously well qualified,'' its highest \npossible rating. As Steve Tober, the chairman of the ABA Standing \nCommittee on the Federal Judiciary, explained, Judge Roberts has ``the \nadmiration and respect of his colleagues on and off the bench. And, he \nis, as we have found, the very definition of collegial.''\n  We have also heard from Judge Roberts' friends and coworkers and \nlearned that they respect and admire him. Maureen Mahoney, former \nDeputy Solicitor General of the United States, said Judge Roberts ``is \nprobably the finest lawyer of his generation.'' She described the \nassistance he provided her in her own career, and testified from her \npersonal experience that he had an enduring commitment to providing \nequal opportunity to women in the workplace.\n  Another example, Professor Kathryn Webb, a lifelong Democrat who said \nthat she does not support President Bush, nonetheless said that Judge \nRoberts has her ``full and enthusiastic support.''\n  Bruce Botelho, the mayor of Juneau, AK, a self-proclaimed liberal \nDemocrat, offered his full support. The mayor worked closely with Judge \nRoberts on several cases and described him as ``the most remarkable and \ninspiring lawyer I have ever met.''\n  Finally, Catherine Stetson, a partner at Hogan & Hartson and a \nlongtime colleague of Judge Roberts, offered her praise as well. She \ntold us how Judge Roberts helped her transition back into the workplace \nafter the birth of her first child. According to Stetson, Judge Roberts \nsupported her in both of her roles as lawyer and as mother, ``and he \ndid it quietly and without fanfare.'' She explained how Judge Roberts \nwas instrumental in helping her become a partner at Hogan & Hartson, \ndespite the unfounded concerns of others that her obligations as a new \nmother might interfere somehow with her ability to do the job.\n  All of these individuals have something in common. What they have in \ncommon is they know Judge Roberts personally. They have seen him handle \ncases. They have seen him deal with clients. They know him as an \nindividual. They know him as a human being. They have worked with him. \nEach one of them supports his nomination to be the next Chief Justice \nof the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  It is true that we have heard comments and some testimony from well-\nintended individuals who oppose Judge Roberts, but I must say these \nindividuals do not know Judge Roberts the way Maureen Mahoney does, \nthey did not work with him the way Mayor Botelho has, and they have not \ndealt with Judge Roberts on a day-to-day basis the way Catherine \nStetson has.\n  To be sure, over the past several months we have learned a great deal \nabout who John Roberts is. We know about his extraordinary professional \naccomplishments. We have seen the overwhelming bipartisan support that \nhe has earned from his colleagues in the legal profession. We have \nheard from John Roberts himself in a very eloquent defense of the rule \nof law. For all of these reasons, I will vote to confirm Judge John \nRoberts as the 17th Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, and I \ncertainly urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allen). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, last week the Judiciary Committee gave its \nsolid, bipartisan recommendation that the Senate confirm John G. \nRoberts, Jr., to be Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. The Senate \nshould follow that recommendation with a substantial bipartisan vote \nsupporting this exceptional nominee. As the Los Angeles Times put it \nwhen endorsing Judge Roberts, anything short of an overwhelming vote \nwould be an indictment of petty partisanship.\n  I think Judge Roberts is the most analyzed and evaluated Supreme \nCourt nominee in history. The American Bar Association, whose rating my \nDemocratic colleagues once hailed as the gold standard for evaluating \njudicial nominees, completed two exhaustive reviews. Each time the ABA \nunanimously gave Judge Roberts its highest well-qualified rating.\n  The ABA, by the way, includes in its criterion of judicial \ntemperament such important qualities as compassion, openmindedness, \nfreedom from bias, and commitment to equal justice under law.\n  Judge Roberts spent almost 20 hours before the Judiciary Committee \nwhile Senators asked him 673 questions. Senators then asked him 243 \nmore questions in writing. Judge Roberts provided nearly 3,000 pages to \nthe Judiciary Committee, including his published articles, \ncongressional testimony, transcripts from interviews, speeches, and \npanel discussions and material related to the dozens of cases that he \nargued before the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  The Judiciary Committee obtained more than 14,000 pages of material \nin the public domain, including the opinions Judge Roberts authored and \njoined while on the U.S. Court of Appeals and legal briefs from his \nyears at the law firm of Hogan & Hartson and as Deputy Solicitor \nGeneral in the first Bush administration.\n\n  As if all of that were not enough, the Judiciary Committee obtained a \nstaggering 82,943 pages of additional material from the National \nArchives and both the Reagan and Bush Libraries regarding Judge \nRoberts' service in those administrations. Total that up, and we have \nmore than 100,000 pages of material on a 50-year-old nominee. That \namounts to about 2,000 pages for every year of his life.\n\n[[Page S10412]]\n\n  By orders of magnitude, this is more information than any Senators \nhave had about any previous Supreme Court nominee.\n  The real debate over this nomination is about the standard we should \napply to this mountain of information. The standard a Senator applies \nreflects a particular job description, what a Senator believes judges \nshould do in our system of government. For some Senators, it is a \npolitical job description. They see judges as playing a political role, \ndelivering results favoring certain political interests, setting or \nchanging policy, creating new rights, defending social progress, and \nblazing a trail toward justice and equality.\n  Not surprisingly, Senators who believe in this kind of political job \ndescription ask political questions and apply political standards \nduring the hiring process.\n  During the hearing, for example, the distinguished assistant minority \nleader, a member of the Judiciary Committee, told Judge Roberts he \nneeded to know the nominee's personal values. Personal values are a \ncondition for judicial service only if judges make their decisions \nbased on their personal values. This is a political standard.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, a former Judiciary \nCommittee chairman, has repeatedly said that the central question is, \nin his words, Whose side will Judge Roberts be on when different kinds \nof cases come before him?\n  Demanding that judges take sides before cases even begin is, again, a \npolitical standard.\n  Last week on the Senate floor, the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. \nKerry, said he could not support Judge Roberts because, as he put it:\n\n       I can't say with confidence that I know on a sufficient \n     number of critical constitutional issues how he would rule.\n\n  Basing support for a judicial nominee on a checklist of results, \nwithout regard for the facts or the law in each case, is a political \nstandard.\n  The Senator from California, Mrs. Boxer, last week announced her \nopposition to Judge Roberts and described her standard by asking: Who \nwill be the winners if we confirm Judge Roberts?\n  This question, of course, completely contradicts the age-old teaching \nof parents in California, my home State of Utah, and everywhere else \nthat it does not matter if one wins or loses but how they play the \ngame.\n  Focusing on the political correctness of a judge's results rather \nthan the judicial correctness of his reasoning is a political standard.\n  Other Senators, and I place myself squarely in this camp, use a \njudicial standard. We see judges as playing a judicial rather than a \npolitical role.\n  During his hearing, Judge Roberts properly compared judges to umpires \nwho apply rules they did not make and cannot change to a contest before \nthem.\n  Can anyone imagine conditioning an umpire's employment on knowing \nbefore he officiates his first game which teams on the roster will win \nor lose?\n  Similarly, judges must not take sides before a case begins.\n  Senators who believe in a judicial job description ask judicial \nquestions and apply judicial standards during the hiring process, and \nduring the hearing process as well, I might add.\n  I want to know, for example, whether Judge Roberts believes he can \nmake law at all, not the particular law he would make. I want to know \nwhether parties will win before him because the law favors their side, \nnot because he does.\n  Like America's Founders, I believe it makes all the difference for \nour liberty whether judges occupy a judicial or a political role in our \nsystem of government.\n  In the Federalist No. 78, Alexander Hamilton wrote, quoting the \npolitical philosopher, Montesquieu, that there is no liberty at all if \njudicial power is not separated from legislative and executive power.\n  The separation of powers is literally the lynchpin of liberty. That \nprinciple had a 200-year-old pedigree when America's Founders listed as \na reason for seeking independence that King George had made judges \ndependent upon his political will.\n  We must insist on appointing judges who meet a judicial rather than a \npolitical standard.\n\n  I will list some of the evidence that Judge Roberts meets this \njudicial standard.\n  Judge Roberts told the Judiciary Committee that a judge is obligated \nto respect precedent, and he described in some detail the principles \nguiding how judges utilize those prior decisions.\n  If my friends on the other side oppose this nomination, do they \nbelieve that judges should not respect precedent? Do they reject the \ntraditional principles of stare decisis that Judge Roberts outlined? If \nso, my friends should try to make that case to the American people. If \nnot, if they agree with Judge Roberts that judges should respect \nprecedent, then they should vote to confirm this nomination.\n  Judge Roberts repeatedly insisted that judges must be impartial. Here \nis how he put it:\n\n       I think people on both sides need to know that if they go \n     to the Supreme Court that they're going to be on a level \n     playing field, the judge is going to interpret the law, that \n     the judge is going to apply the Constitution and not take \n     sides in their dispute.\n\n  That was said by Judge John G. Roberts, Jr., on September 13, 2005.\n  If my friends on the other side oppose this nomination, are they \nsaying that judges should instead be partial, that judges should \nactually take sides, that people coming before the Court do not deserve \nthe confidence that judges will be fair? If that is what they believe, \nI invite them to try to make that case to the American people. If not, \nif they agree with Judge Roberts that judges should be impartial, then \nthey should confirm his nomination.\n  Judge Roberts said that judges must be open to the views of their \njudicial colleagues. This is a mark of modesty and humility he \nconsistently said should characterize judges. If my friends on the \nother side of this nomination oppose this nomination, are they arguing \nthat judges should not consider anyone else's views but narrowly insist \nthat they are always right? If so, then once again they should make \ntheir case to the American people. If not, if they agree with Judge \nRoberts that modest judges remain open to consider what others have to \nsay, then they should vote for his nomination.\n  Judge Roberts told us that judges are not politicians. If my friends \non the other side oppose this nomination, do they really believe that \njudges, and not elected legislators, should make the law and determine \npublic policy? Do my friends really believe that there is no difference \nbetween what the Justices do across the street in the Supreme Court and \nwhat we do in this Chamber? If so, I wish them luck trying to make that \ncase to the American people. If not, if they agree with America's \nFounders and with Judge Roberts that judges are not politicians, they \nshould vote to confirm this nomination.\n  Judge Roberts says judges are the servants of the law. If my friends \non the other side oppose this nomination, do they believe judges are \ninstead the masters of the law? Do they believe the Constitution is \nwhatever the Supreme Court says it is? If so, then I invite them to \nmake that case to the American people. If not, if they agree with \nAmerica's Founders that the Constitution governs the judicial as well \nas the legislative branch, if they agree with Judge Roberts that judges \nare as subject to the rule of law as the parties before them, then my \nfriends should vote to confirm this nomination.\n  Judge Roberts pledged that, as he has done on the appeals court \nbench, he will approach every case with an open mind and consider each \ncase on its own merits.\n  If my friends on the other side oppose this nomination, do they \nbelieve instead judges should have a closed mind on issues that come \nbefore them, that judges should prejudge issues in cases even before \nthey know the facts?\n  If so, then I urge my friends to try and convince the American \npeople.\n  If not, if they agree with Judge Roberts that judges should safeguard \ntheir impartiality and keep an open mind, then they should vote to \nconfirm this nomination.\n  Judge Roberts said:\n\n       The role of the judge is limited, that judges are to decide \n     the cases before them, they're not to legislate.\n\n  If my friends on the other side oppose this nomination, do they \nbelieve instead judges have an unlimited role,\n\n[[Page S10413]]\n\nthat judges should decide cases not properly before them, and that \njudges should do the legislating?\n  If so, I urge them to try to make that case before the American \npeople.\n  If not, if they share Judge Roberts' view about the proper limited \njudicial role, then they should vote to confirm this nomination.\n  Judge Roberts said judges must decide cases--and I am quoting him \nagain--judges must decide cases:\n\n     according to the rule of law, not their own social \n     preferences, not their policy views, not their personal \n     preferences, but according to the rule of law.\n\n  Again, that was on September 13, 2005.\n  If my friends on the other side oppose this nomination, do they \nbelieve judges should decide cases based on their personal preferences \nor policy views rather than the rule of law?\n  If so, again, they should make this case to the American people.\n  If not, if they agree with Judge Roberts that the rule of law trumps \na judge's personal views, then they should vote to confirm this \nnomination.\n  Judge Roberts said when Congress enacts a statute, we do not expect \njudges to substitute their judgment for ours but to implement our view \nof what we are accomplishing. If my friends on the other side oppose \nthis nomination, are they instead saying judges should substitute their \njudgment for ours?\n  If so, again, they should make that case to the American people.\n  If not, if they agree with Judge Roberts that Congress's intent \nshould prevail regarding Congress's own statutes, then they should vote \nto confirm this nomination.\n  Judge Roberts said:\n\n       I don't think the Court should be the task master of \n     Congress. I think the Constitution is the Court's task master \n     and it's Congress' task master as well.\n\n  That was said on September 14 of this year.\n  If my friends on the other side oppose this nomination, do they mean \nthe Supreme Court should in fact be the taskmaster of Congress, and \neven of the Constitution itself?\n  If so, then I wish them well, trying to convince the American people \nby making that case to the American people.\n  If not, if they agree with Judge Roberts that the Constitution is the \ntaskmaster of both Congress and the Supreme Court, then they should \nvote to confirm this nomination.\n  Judge Roberts told us the Bill of Rights does not change during times \nof war or crisis. If my friends on the other side oppose this \nnomination, are they arguing for setting aside the Bill of Rights in \ntimes of war or crisis?\n  If so, then they should make their case to the American people.\n  If not, if they agree with Judge Roberts that neither the Bill of \nRights nor a judge's obligation to uphold the rule of law is suspended \nin a time of war or crisis, then they should vote to uphold this \nnomination.\n  I want to quote Judge Roberts again because his particular words are \nvery important. He said:\n\n       If the Constitution says that the little guy should win, \n     the little guy is going to win in court before me. But if the \n     Constitution says that the big guy should win, well, then, \n     the big guy is going to win, because my obligation is to the \n     Constitution.\n\n  He said that on September 15 of this year.\n  If my friends on the other side oppose this nomination, are they \narguing that whoever the little guy might be must win, regardless of \nwhat the facts and regardless of what the law requires? Are they saying \njudges should disregard their oaths to do justice without respect to \npersons?\n  If so, I will be watching with great expectation as they try to make \nthat case to the American people.\n  If not, if they agree with Judge Roberts that the law, not the judge, \ndetermines who wins, if they agree with Judge Roberts that the judge's \nobligation is to the Constitution and not to a particular side, then \nthey should confirm this nomination.\n  These examples show the type of judge John Roberts is on the appeals \ncourt, the kind of Justice John Roberts will be on the Supreme Court. \nJudge Roberts knows the difference between politics and law. He knows \nas a judge he must settle legal disputes by interpreting and applying \nlaw and leave the politics to the politicians.\n\n  We have all the information we need about this exceptional nominee. \nIf we apply a judicial rather than a political standard, the Senate \nwill confirm him as the Nation's 17th Justice overwhelmingly and \nwithout delay.\n  Judge Roberts is one of the finest nominees ever to come before the \nCongress of the United States, and in particular the Senate confirming \nbody. Not only was he an excellent student, graduating from Harvard in \nonly 3 years as an undergraduate, but he became the top graduate in law \nschool and the editor in chief of the Harvard Law Review, a position \neverybody in this Chamber has to respect and admire.\n  He also served as a clerk for Judge Friendly, one of the greatest \ncircuit court judges this country has ever seen. He served as a clerk \nfor Chief Justice Rehnquist.\n  I was impressed at the Rehnquist funeral to see some 95 former clerks \npaying respect to their Justice Rehnquist, some of whom were my fellow \nUtahns.\n  He then worked in the White House counsel's office as a young man and \nserved with distinction there. He then went on to become Deputy \nSolicitor General of the United States and did a terrific job while \nthere. He rose to become one of the top partners in one of the top law \nfirms in this country and argued 39 cases before the U.S. Supreme \nCourt. Hardly anybody can make that claim today.\n  I have asked various Justices on the Supreme Court who they consider \nto be the best appellate lawyer to appear before them, and invariably \nthe name John Roberts comes up from the Justices themselves.\n  I was intrigued that Justice Stevens is overjoyed that John Roberts \nis going to join them on the Court because he has such respect for John \nRoberts.\n  I have to say in 20 hours of testimony, how could anybody vote \nagainst him? I have to say also it concerns me that there will be some \nwho will. I suggest if they would vote against Judge Roberts for the \nSupreme Court, then I doubt sincerely there is any nominee this \nPresident could put forth they would vote for, and that is a sorry case \nand I think a sad indictment.\n  I urge everybody in this body to vote for this outstanding nominee \nfor Chief Justice of the United States. In doing so, I don't think \nanybody who does is going to be sorry afterward. Yes, I believe him to \nbe conservative. Yes, I believe he is not going to be an activist on \nthe bench. Yes, I believe he will honor and sustain the law--and I know \none thing: he is going to approach the law as intelligently as any \nperson who has ever been nominated to the Supreme Court. I think people \nwho watched those hearings have to come to the same conclusion. If they \ndo, then I hope our colleagues who have announced they are going to \nvote against him will change their mind, do what is right, and vote for \nhim.\n  Remember, when now Justices Ginsburg and Breyer came before this \nbody, I was the leader on the Judiciary Committee. I have to say, we \nRepublicans all knew both of those now Justices were social liberals, \nthat they disagreed with many of the things we believed and we \ndisagreed with many of the things they believed. But they were both \nqualified and they were put forth by the then President of the United \nStates, President William Jefferson Clinton. And Presidents deserve \nrespect on these nominations.\n  Justice Ginsburg was confirmed on a vote of 96 to 3, and I believe \nJustice Breyer was confirmed on a vote of 87 to 9, which means \nvirtually every Republican voted for both of them. We did not take the \npolitical way. I have to say I don't think others should take it here \nin this case with this person who everybody acknowledges is \nexceptionally well qualified, including the American Bar Association.\n  I recommend everybody vote for Judge Roberts, and in the end you are \ngoing to be able to go to sleep at night knowing you did the right \nthing.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S10414]]\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I come to the Chamber today to discuss \nthe nomination of Judge John G. Roberts to be Chief Justice of the \nUnited States.\n  Last week, the Senate Judiciary Committee approved the nomination of \nJudge Roberts to be the next Chief Justice of the United States by a \n13-to-5 margin. This came after weeks of exhaustive research by the \nJudiciary Committee and a thorough set of hearings.\n  While I wish the White House would have been more cooperative during \nthe process by releasing a more comprehensive set of documents relating \nto Judge Roberts' work in the executive branch, I do believe the \ncommittee hearings were conducted in a fair and dignified manner, and I \ndo have some understanding of where Judge Roberts' judicial views fall \nwithin the political spectrum.\n  After careful review of Judge Roberts' testimony and the information \nprepared by the Judiciary Committee, I have come to the conclusion that \nJudge Roberts should be confirmed by the Senate to be Chief Justice of \nthe U.S. Supreme Court. It is my intention to vote in favor of his \nconfirmation when his nomination comes for a full vote before the \nSenate later this week.\n  There are few decisions of greater consequence that I will ever be \nasked to make than whether to approve an individual for a lifetime \nappointment as Chief Justice of our Nation's highest Court. While there \nis no absolute certainty how Judge Roberts will conduct himself as \nChief Justice when he is confirmed, it is my belief that he appears to \nbe a thoughtful and respected jurist who possesses integrity and great \nlegal skills. I see no reason to believe that the nominee is an \nideologue or otherwise outside the broad mainstream of contemporary \nconservative legal thinking. In addition, it is important to note that \nwith the confirmation of Judge Roberts to replace Chief Justice \nRehnquist, the balance of the Court will be maintained.\n  It is the prerogative of the President to nominate whomever he sees \nfit to lifetime appointments to the Federal judiciary, so it should \ncome as no surprise that President Bush has nominated a conservative \njurist such as Judge Roberts for the Supreme Court. While I have voted \nagainst President Bush's nominees to the lower Federal courts on a \nmodest number of instances, I have voted roughly 200 times to confirm \njudicial nominees who I believed were conservative Republicans of great \nlegal skill and who deserved bipartisan respect. With the nomination of \nJudge Roberts, I am once again prepared to support a qualified, \nconservative judicial nominee. However, with this vote I also send a \nmessage to President Bush that I hope his nominee to fill the vacancy \nof retiring Associate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor will as well be a \nperson of great legal skill and who has the ability to garner strong \nbipartisan support.\n  In my home State of South Dakota, we have seen difficult and \npolarizing political battles over the past few years. I believe South \nDakotans as well as all Americans desire a bipartisan centrist approach \nto government. Our Nation is governed best when it is governed from the \nbroad bipartisan mainstream but not by the extremes of the political \nfar left or far right. I encourage President Bush to nominate someone \nfor Justice O'Connor's seat who will further unite the citizens of our \ngreat Nation rather than drive a political wedge between them. The \nproper legal foundation for America is found in the broad mainstream of \ncontemporary jurisprudence. It is my hope that Judge Roberts will unite \nAmericans and serve the Supreme Court in a fair and prudent and \ncentrist manner.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n         Unanimous Consent Agreement--Executive Calendar No. 1\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, on behalf of the leader, I ask unanimous \nconsent that at 5:30 today the Senate proceed to executive session to \nconsider the following treaty on today's Executive Calendar: No. 1. I \nfurther ask unanimous consent that the treaty be considered as having \npassed through its various parliamentary stages up to and including the \npresentation of the resolution of ratification, that any committee \nconditions, declarations, or reservations be agreed to as applicable, \nthat any statements be printed in the Record, and that at 5:30 today \nthe Senate vote on the resolution of ratification; further that when \nthe resolution of ratification is voted upon, the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table, and the President be notified of the Senate's \naction.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to speak a few moments about \nthe need for health care assistance to Katrina-related victims. When I \nfinish, I am then going to join with Senator Grassley, the chairman of \nthe Finance Committee, in a unanimous consent request, and that is \nbring up and pass the bill.\n  Tina Eagerton fled Louisiana for Clearwater, FL, to escape Hurricane \nKatrina. As Tampa Bay's 10 News reported, Tina is 7 months pregnant. \nShe has a high-risk pregnancy. Plainly she needs a doctor's care, but \nTina could not find a Florida doctor who would accept her Louisiana \nMedicaid card. She said, ``I've called some doctors, [but they say] `We \ndon't know what to do.' I guess nobody has gotten the memo.''\n  Congress needs to get the memo. We need to pass S. 1716, the \nEmergency Health Care Relief Act, and we need to do it today.\n  The last 4 weeks, we have seen terrible destruction, destruction that \nKatrina wrought as well as Rita has wrought; more than 1,000 people are \ndead, a million people displaced, hundreds of billions of dollars of \ndamage. I went down there to the gulf to see it myself, and I must say \nit is worse than the pictures.\n  Katrina has exposed deep problems that plague American society: \nchronic poverty, stark inequality, strained race relations. We could \nnot solve all of these problems today, but some are so pervasive, so \nsevere, that a single bill cannot remedy them. It requires a sustained \nnational debate and reexamination of what we as a nation hold dear.\n  We cannot fix everything today, but we can fix some things today. One \nthing we can fix is a lack of health coverage for tens of thousands of \nKatrina survivors. We can and must pass the Emergency Health Care \nRelief Act today.\n  This broadly supported legislation would provide victims of Hurricane \nKatrina with the health care services they urgently need. As we so \noften do, Chairman Grassley and I worked together on this bill. We \nworked together on the Katrina tax package which the President signed \nFriday and which is even now putting cash in the hands of Katrina \nvictims.\n  And we worked together on this health bill as well. We spent a lot of \ntime together--our staffers--consulting with Senators, especially with \nSenators in related States.\n  Our health bill would provide temporary Medicaid coverage for Katrina \nsurvivors, available through a streamlined application. It is that \nsimple. These benefits would be available right away. Those eligible \nwould get coverage for up to 5 months, with a possible extension of 5 \nmonths.\n  Pregnant women such as Tina Eagerton, as well as children, would be \neligible for health care at higher income levels.\n  To support those who lost their jobs and income, our bill allows \nthose individuals to keep their current coverage with assistance from \nthe Federal Government. And our bill would set up a fund to help health \ncare providers deal with their tremendous uncompensated care losses--\nhealth care, hospitals, specialists. These funds would go to providers \nwho experienced a surge in patient load from the evacuation of Katrina \nvictims. These funds would go to those facilities that no longer have \nthe patient base to make ends meet.\n  But this is not just health care providers who are incurring \nuncompensated care expenses. States are as well. Texas has taken in \n200,000 Katrina evacuees. Katrina is adding $30 million a month in \ncosts to the Texas Medicaid Program.\n  Our legislation provides Texas--and other States caring for Katrina \nevacuees--with the full Federal Medicaid funding for those evacuees.\n  The bill would also cover all the costs of Louisiana's and \nMississippi's Medicaid and child health programs for 2006, with the \nsame treatment being provided to a number of particularly ravaged \ncounties in Alabama.\n  This legislation would give solid help to those who receive TANF and \nunemployment insurance.\n  In short, our bill does a great deal to help Katrina victims in \ncommonsense ways.\n  As a result, our bill has broad support from consumer, health care, \nand business groups. Here is what some of the groups have to say about \nour bill.\n  The American Red Cross says:\n\n       As our nation faces the challenging task of ensuring that \n     the victims of Hurricane Katrina receive the care, \n     compassion, and support needed to reconstruct their lives, \n     legislation such as yours helps to ensure their health care \n     needs will be met.\n\n  The American Hospital Association says of our bill:\n\n       [It] is an important first step toward getting assistance \n     to the thousands of people who have been affected by the \n     storm, as well as those who are providing their care.\n\n  The National Governors Association says:\n\n       The Nation's Governors are very supportive of your relief \n     package. [The] additional investments in Medicaid and TANF \n     that your relief package provide will be critical to help \n     these individuals put their lives back together and regain \n     some sense of stability.\n\n  Congress has taken some steps to respond to the Katrina disaster. We \nhave passed more than $60 billion in funding for FEMA. We have passed \nKatrina-targeted tax relief. These bills are helping us in what may be \nthe biggest relief operation for a natural disaster in American \nhistory.\n  But we also must do more to help the victims of this natural--and \nnational--disaster. We must provide Katrina victims with access to \nhealth care--not done in part of the legislation--and we must do it \nnow.\n  Americans have responded generously. Americans have given of their \ntime, through the efforts of tens of thousands of volunteers.\n  Americans have opened their homes. Web sites report offers for \nshelter totaling nearly 270,000 beds. And Americans have opened their \nwallets in an unprecedented fashion. In the 3 weeks following the \nhurricane, Americans contributed more than $1.2 billion to help \nvictims.\n  But individual citizens can do only so much. At some point Congress \nneeds to help. We need to help people such as Rosalind Breaux. Of \nRosalind Breaux, the Chicago Tribune reported:\n\n       Diagnosed with colon cancer on May 1, Ms. Breaux was \n     scheduled for her third round of Chemotherapy on August 31, a \n     day after flooding began to wreck New Orleans and Charity \n     Hospital where she had been receiving care. Breaux and her \n     family ended up settling temporarily in Baton Rouge. \n     Nauseated with constant fatigue, profound weakness and \n     frequent pain, Breaux has been trying to survive the stress \n     of her situation as best she could. Meanwhile, her husband, a \n     policeman at Charity Hospital, has lost his job and there are \n     questions about whether his insurance will pay for her care. \n     ``It's been so frustrating not knowing what's going to \n     happen,'' she said. ``I just pray I can make it through \n     this.''\n\n\n[[Page S10416]]\n\n\n  We need to help. Congress needs to ensure that people such as \nRosalind Breaux and Tina Eagerton have health care. That is the least \nwe can do.\n  Let us rise to the level of caring and sympathy of the American \npeople who have given so much to the victims of this disaster. Let us \ntake action to meet the needs of those whom Katrina has displaced and \ndisadvantaged, and let us do our part to help this region and its \npeople get back on their feet.\n  We can do this today--this evening, now--by passing the Emergency \nHealth Care Relief Act, legislation which the chairman of the \ncommittee, Senator Grassley, and I have worked on so vigorously, so \nassiduously and comprehensively. Talking to Senators, talking to \ngroups, we have worked on this, and it is a balanced bill, a needed \nbill. Time is of the essence.\n  I urge the Senate to act tonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, \nSenator Baucus, ranking Democrat of the committee that has jurisdiction \nover this issue of Medicaid, to urge passage of the Emergency Health \nCare Relief Act of 2005. He explained very well how we have worked out \nin a bipartisan way the contents of this legislation, not only between \nSenator Baucus and me but by involving the staff of everybody on the \ncommittee, as well as consulting, particularly, the Senators from \nArkansas, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama.\n  We are all very deeply moved by the pictures and by the stories of \nthose from the States who have been hurt by Katrina--and now, of \ncourse, Rita--their homes, their jobs and, worst of all, their loved \nones who have given up everything. My heart, of course, goes out, as \nwell, to the others who have suffered as much as a result of this \nterrible disaster.\n  I think the need to act is very obvious. About 250,000 people have \nbeen evacuated as a result of this disaster.\n  According to a survey by the Washington Post, fully half of the \nevacuees have no health insurance. Four in ten of the evacuees are \nphysically disabled or have chronic illness. According to a survey done \nby the same paper, 6 in 10 evacuees have incomes of less than $20,000.\n  It is a function of our Government and our responsibility as \nlegislators to provide assistance to these vulnerable families.\n  I would like to briefly outline this legislation. The Katrina health \ncare relief package is very targeted and, most importantly, temporary. \nIt is both a targeted and temporary benefit for the neediest \nindividuals and families.\n  It provides assistance with private health insurance premiums for \npeople in businesses affected by hurricanes so they won't lose their \ncoverage; an uncompensated care funding pool to cover evacuation costs \nand emergency health care costs related to the hurricane; most \nimportantly, temporary Medicaid coverage limited to 5 months, unless \nthe President would extend it for another 5 months, limited to only \nthose residents and evacuees from the hardest hit counties of the \nState; and 100 percent Federal funding for the disaster-related \nMedicaid costs until December 31, 2006.\n  The compromise package bill limits Medicaid to those most in need: To \nthose below the poverty level; pregnant women and children below 200 \npercent of poverty, which is current law in Texas already, as one \nexample; and those eligible under the host State's Medicaid coverage \nunder existing law.\n  It is very limited. The bottom line is that this is a responsible \ncompromise. It is time limited. It is targeted only to those who have \nthe most need.\n  The legislation includes a simplified enrollment procedure. One \nimportant part of our bill that I want to highlight would help those \nwith private insurance pay premiums on their policy. Many of the folks \naffected by Katrina have private health insurance which they would like \nto keep.\n  Many of the evacuees also have chronic conditions. For these folks, \nlosing health insurance can mean the loss of important provider \nrelationships. This legislation will help these folks avoid that \nsituation.\n\n  The legislation also offers help to certain employers who, prior to \nKatrina, offered their employees health insurance.\n  We all know that many businesses face a difficult time in maintaining \ncoverage. Now these businesses will be able to get back up and \ncontribute to a revitalization of the economy in that area.\n  Our bill would also waive the Medicaid Part B late enrollment penalty \nfor those who miss the initial enrollment period. We don't want people \nto have opportunities to get into Part B enrollment only to have to pay \na penalty when they wouldn't otherwise do that if we had not had the \nhurricane.\n  I am pleased that Senator Baucus and I have been able to take action \non behalf of those whose lives have been disrupted by the hurricane.\n  As Senator Baucus said, the bill is supported by the Governors \nAssociation, the American Medical Association, the American Hospital \nAssociation, the Health Care Leadership Council, the American Red \nCross, the March of Dimes, and many others.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this legislation, and I urge swift \nSenate consideration of S. 1716.\n  I would also like to point out some things more procedural than just \nthe contents of the bill. As a reminder to all of my friends on this \nside of the aisle, the Wednesday after Labor Day we had a news \nconference assuring the people of this country--that news conference \ninvolved leadership, as well as those who are chairmen of the \ncommittee--promising appropriate as well as immediate relief for the \nStates that are hurt. That hurting is extended beyond the States that \nwere hit by the hurricane to States that have taken evacuees.\n  I also point out that it is quite obvious from television the hurt \nthat people have. Also, we tried to pretty much do a total paralleling \nof what we did for New York City after 9/11. Along that line, I remind \nmy colleagues of something that President Bush said as he was speaking \nin a news conference about the hurricane not discriminating. We were \nnot going to discriminate.\n  It seems to me that doing for the people in this area hurt by this \nKatrina catastrophe ought to be done in the same way that we did to \nhelp people who were hurt by the New York City 9/11 catastrophe.\n  Then, as a practical matter--and I don't say this just because \nSenator Lincoln is in the Chamber--I use her as an example of a lot of \npeople who are trying to accomplish the goals that Senator Baucus and I \nwant to accomplish, as she did on an appropriations bill by offering an \namendment.\n  That amendment went much further than what we do in this legislation. \nShe withdrew that amendment. But I think there are people who are going \nto want to push those issues if we don't move in this comprehensive, \nbipartisan way that Senator Baucus and I have done. I remind colleagues \nthat we might end up actually adopting a proposal much more expensive \nthan S. 1716, if Senator Lincoln offers her amendment, than we do \nthrough this approach that we are taking here in the case of Senator \nBaucus and my working out this bipartisan agreement.\n  I urge that we move forward with this legislation for the reasons \nthat I have given, as well as the substance being a responsible \napproach.\n  I would like to ask, if I could, unanimous consent that we move \nforward with this legislation. Then, if somebody wants to speak \nafterwards, speak afterwards on the subject.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we move immediately to \nthe consideration of S. 1716.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I appreciate the efforts that the chairman \nof the Finance Committee and the ranking member have made on this \nlegislation. They are working hard to help out the people who have been \naffected by Hurricane Katrina on the gulf coast. All of our hearts go \nout to the people in the gulf region. The devastation that region has \nexperienced simply cannot be put into words. The issue we are \nconsidering tonight is not what kind of assistance should be provided \nto evacuees but how that assistance should be provided and whether this \nshould be done by unanimous consent.\n\n[[Page S10417]]\n\n  The administration has taken administrative steps to provide \nnecessary medical care to evacuees. They have provided Medicaid waivers \nto certain states. Secretary Leavitt has pledged additional waivers to \nstates that request one if the request is reasonable. For its part, \nCongress has already approved $62 billion for the recovery of victims \nand their care. I am concerned that this bill involves new spending \nrather than reprogramming a part of the $62 billion Congress has \nalready appropriated. This bill would add an additional $8.9 billion in \nspending on top of the money FEMA has already been given.\n  We should make some changes to this bill. I have serious concerns \nabout four provisions included in this bill. First, this bill provides \nfor temporary expansion of Medicaid. Second, it requires that the \nfederal government provide 100% FMAP for Louisiana, Mississippi and \naffected counties in Alabama. This is a dangerous precedent and removes \nany incentive for these states to keep Medicaid costs down. Third, it \nholds 29 states harmless from a scheduled FMAP reduction in 2006. This \nmeans the federal government continues to pay more of the costs, even \nin states with few or no Hurricane Katrina evacuees. My final concern \nis that this bill also increases spending by $8.9 billion and probably \nunnecessarily so given the steps that Congress and the Administration \nhave already taken.\n  Any legislative proposal should be well thought out and fiscally \nresponsible. If these services can be provided administratively, which \nHHS says they can, we should allow HHS to do so. Congress does not, and \nshould not, alter the Medicaid formula as this bill seeks to.\n  We, as a Congress, need to get a better handle on the money being \nspent. We have an obligation to those affected by the hurricane as well \nas to those Americans we are asking to help pay the costs of relief. We \nmust ensure this money is spent wisely.\n  I object to the unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I am astounded by the statement made by the Senator who \njust spoke. This has nothing to do with the $62 billion, nothing \nwhatever. If there are contract problems with FEMA dollars, we will \ndiscuss those and deal with them when this Senate deals with additional \nappropriations requests related to Katrina. This has nothing whatever \nto do with that. Those are FEMA dollars, contracts to repair roads and \nbridges.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Not at this moment, no.\n  It has nothing to do with FEMA. We will deal with legitimate points \nthat the Senator from Nevada raised at another time and context when we \ndeal with additional appropriations for FEMA. This has nothing to do \nwith that.\n  We are talking about people. FEMA was projects, contracts. This is \npeople. This is people's health care. This is Medicaid, that pays for \npeople's health care. This is an emergency. It is people's health \ncare--for people. That is what this is.\n  It has nothing to do with FEMA, nothing whatever.\n  I hope the Senators understand that. I hope the country understands \nand realizes that. I am astounded at the objection I just heard because \nit has nothing to do with the objection at hand.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield to the Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. If the Senator from Nevada is worried about the dollars \nFEMA received, why did no one object to that? Why did no one object to \nthe $60 billion being sent to FEMA, which has been so inefficient in \nthe wake of this disaster?\n  Now we are going to ask, as the chairman of the Committee on Finance \npoints out, the disproportionately low-income, disproportionately \ndisabled individuals to pay for this?\n  I am here today to speak in support of the Emergency Care Relief Act \nof 2005 and to compliment the chairman of the Committee on Finance and \nthe ranking member, Senator Baucus, for making this important issue a \npriority, for working hard and bringing people together to recognize it \nis not only a natural disaster but a national disaster. We as Americans \nhave to come together to help our neighbors.\n  I find it odd that here we are talking about $8 billion, $7.5 \nbillion, $8 billion compared to the $60 billion no-bid contracts. Maybe \nmy colleagues who want to object to this are willing to jump in and \nhelp provide the bipartisan-nonpartisan commission we need to review \nthe response to the natural disasters that happened on the gulf coast. \nMaybe they want to join in saying we need somebody who can review what \nis going on--not just what happened then but what continues to happen \nin FEMA.\n  Our Nation's health care providers and States have been there at a \ntime when vulnerable Americans needed them the most. The moment \nHurricane Katrina hit the gulf coast, they jumped into action without \nbeing asked. No one asked them to get in their cars and drive to the \ngulf coast to provide medical care, to get in their helicopters and go \nrescue those people off those rooftops. States all across the country \nopened their doors to welcome Katrina survivors. Hospitals sent \nhelicopters to the gulf coast to evacuate those who needed immediate \nattention. Doctors, nurses, and other health care providers have come \ntogether to provide much needed health care to thousands of Katrina \nsurvivors. And they did it all with no questions asked. They exemplify \nwhat it means to be a good neighbor and what it means to be a part of \nthis American family.\n\n  Our own Arkansas Children's Hospital is one of the many hospitals \naround the country that immediately jumped into action to provide \nhealth care for Katrina survivors. Even before the worst of the storm \nhit, they were evacuating young patients to safety. One patient, in \nparticular, was a 9-year old boy. Let me tell you, that hits home with \nme; I have twin boys who are 9 years old. This young man had a severe \nheart condition that required a complicated heart pump to be flown in \nfrom Germany. Arkansas Children's Hospital evacuated this child from \nLouisiana, and he received the necessary pump, saving this 9-year-old \nboy's life. Does that mean anything to anybody in this body? It meant \nsomething to his parents. And for once, we as a Senate should stand up \nand take notice.\n  Arkansas Children's Hospital did. And they have already provided $1.7 \nmillion in uncompensated care to Katrina survivors.\n  There are health care providers all around the country doing \nsimilarly inspiring work. In Arkansas, our pharmacists have been \nfilling prescriptions as fast as they can, paying special attention to \nthose who have chronic conditions or were in the middle of their cancer \ntreatment. Senator Baucus mentioned one of those cancer patients.\n  Hospitals have deployed medical teams to approximately 60 camps and \nshelters around our great State to address the medical needs of these \nevacuees. I have always been proud of the people of Arkansas. I have \nalways recognized them as our greatest asset. And I am enormously proud \nof the countless providers and volunteers in Arkansas and all around \nthis great country who have given their time to make sure that the \nhealth care needs of Katrina survivors are met.\n  By passing the Emergency Health Care Relief Act, we in this Senate \nhave the same opportunity to give Katrina survivors, health care \nproviders and States, the relief they so desperately need.\n  We are not talking about walking away and closing the doors. We are \ntalking about a temporary relief for people who jumped in there and \nprovided care, without being asked, without being mandated, but because \nthat is what human beings do when other human beings need that kind of \ncare.\n  Medicaid is our Nation's health care safety net. That is what we are \ntalking about, a safety net for some of the most vulnerable of \nAmericans who have been hit by an unbelievable natural disaster. This \ncrisis has shown just how important this safety net is to our Nation. \nWe need to make sure it does not unravel in the face of this national \nemergency.\n  Our home State of Arkansas, per capita, has taken in unbelievably \ndisproportionate numbers of evacuees--not because we had to, but we \nbelieve that is what it means to be a part of the American family.\n\n[[Page S10418]]\n\n  This place is paralyzed because too few are willing to recognize how \nimportant it is to not only reach out to our neighbors but to also \nfollow up and back up those who have been there in these emergencies, \nto provide the health care needed.\n  I said earlier that it hit home for me. While I was on vacation this \nsummer, one of my 9-year-old sons did get sick. I was in a strange \nState, in a strange town, never been there before. I found a clinic, \nand I went. I was so grateful. I felt so blessed to have Federal \nemployee health insurance, to be able to access health care for my \nchild while on vacation. Think about the mothers, the fathers, the \nfamilies, the elderly who find themselves in a strange place--in a \nchurch, a makeshift camp out of a church or maybe in a church basement \nor maybe in some evacuated housing that has been made a makeshift place \nfor the evacuees to stay. What happens to them when they go to get \nhealth care? What happens to that provider who has to look them in the \neye and say, I don't know where you are going to get health care. That \nis not what we are about in this country.\n  We talked about billions of dollars we have directed to FEMA. We have \ntalked about tax cuts we provided to low-income people who may or may \nnot even know if they can access those tax cuts. But here we are \ntalking about the elemental part of being a good neighbor, a fellow \nhuman being, looking to make sure the essentials of providing health \ncare to our brothers and sisters in this country, and we are going to \nsit here and twiddle our thumbs over redtape? We are going to talk \nabout the possibility of waivers that would cause us to have to \npetition the devastated States to pay back or to look at these waivers \nthat do not have the funding so we give them a false sense of security \nso they can provide these services and then find they do not get \nreimbursed after all?\n  What is our Federal Government for if it is not to provide a safety \nnet at a time such as this, to give peace of mind to the hard-working \nmen and women who provide health care day in and day out? I have been \nto these evacuee camps. I have watched the redtape. I have watched the \nRed Cross volunteers argue with the volunteering physicians and health \ncare providers on whether they can even give a tetanus shot to somebody \nwho had to swim out of New Orleans.\n\n  We have an opportunity to stand up and be counted, to provide \ntemporary peace of mind to the medical providers who are reaching out \nto provide the much needed services to the disproportionately low-\nincome, disproportionately disadvantaged and handicapped.\n  I offered an amendment almost 3 weeks ago. As the chairman mentioned, \nit probably did go a little bit further than what is being talked about \nhere. I am not ashamed of that. But I didn't give away the barn. It was \nstill temporary just to make sure that these evacuees, these fellow \nAmericans, could get the services they need at the most vulnerable time \nof their lives. I was asked in good faith to withdraw my amendment \nbecause nobody wanted to vote against it. Withdraw your amendment and \nwe will work out a good bipartisan deal. Chairman Grassley and Senator \nBaucus did just that.\n  I say to my colleagues who want to object to what we are trying to \ndo, if you have a better answer or you want to say of that $60 billion \nthat every one of us voted for to go to FEMA, maybe you are willing to \nlook to FEMA and make sure that happens, $8 billion out of $60 billion \nis a small piece of the overall pie.\n  I withdrew that amendment in good faith. I hope my colleagues will \nrecognize that we are talking about the American spirit that I hope we \nproduce in the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, what is the regular order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are in morning business with 10-minute \ngrants.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I will respond in part in supporting my \ncolleagues who objected. We do not object in any way to providing \nassistance where it is needed. We have already done so, passing $62 \nbillion in new spending, $9 billion in tax relief. That is a very great \ncore relief effort that is providing assistance to those very much in \nneed in the Gulf Coast States and around the country.\n  The question and the point we object to is whether we consider this \nbill tonight by unanimous consent, an additional $9 billion in \nspending, several new programs, some of which do not really have \nanything to do directly with providing emergency assistance for health \ncare or any other services to those people who need it in the Gulf \nStates. That is the question, whether it is imperative we consider this \nbill now or whether we can move forward in a more deliberative fashion, \nand whether some of the elements in this bill can be improved.\n\n  As I said, we provided $62 billion in appropriations, $9 billion in \ntax relief. So at the very beginning of this discussion we have to ask, \nwith over $40 billion still unexpended and uncommitted, why can't we \nuse a portion of that to cover some of these important needs, some of \nthe health care needs the Senator from Arkansas just described? I think \nthat is one basic reason why I and others object to moving forward \ntonight on this bill. We ought to be able to find a way to utilize some \nof the $62 billion we have already passed through the House and the \nSenate.\n  Second, as I indicated, there is a provision in this legislation that \nchanges reimbursement rates for Medicaid for 29 States, regardless of \nwhether and how many displaced people from the gulf are currently \nhoused in that State, currently seeking services in that State, \ncurrently looking for health care or employment in that State. For 29 \nStates whose reimbursement rate was going to change in 2006, we wave \nthe wand and say: No change to reimbursement rates regardless of how \nyou might have been impacted by Hurricane Katrina or Hurricane Rita. \nThat has nothing to do directly with providing the assistance, the \ncompassion, the care, the health care the previous speakers were \ndescribing.\n  I question whether this is an appropriate vehicle to include such a \nprovision. There is $1.5 billion for disaster relief in Medicaid--well \nintended, well directed. But currently CMS, the regulator of Medicaid, \nis allowing States to apply for waivers to deliver the very kinds of \nbenefits contemplated in that $1.5 billion program. In fact, Texas and \nMississippi and Florida and Alabama have already applied for and have \nreceived waivers to do those very things contemplated in the \nlegislation, which begs the question, is this necessary? And if it is \nnecessary in some shape or form, do we need to commit $1.5 billion, or \ncan we wait and at least better understand how the waiver process is \nproceeding, which has been approved already in those four States? And I \nhope other States that might apply will get a similar fast response.\n  There is also $800 million in this legislation to provide assistance, \nfinancial support to individuals who are covered by private insurance, \nthough indirectly that will provide payment to private insurance \ncompanies whose participants were affected by the hurricanes. I would \nwant, first, to answer the question: What are those private insurers \ndoing for the employees they had covered? Are they walking away from \nthose employees and those businesses because they were affected by this \ntremendous natural catastrophe? I hope that is not the case. I do not \nknow that is the case. But we ought to understand what obligations, \nwhat commitments these private insurers are meeting before we commit an \nadditional $800 million that might allow them to walk away from some of \ntheir economic or moral obligations for those they have covered in the \npast.\n  So $1.5 billion in a disaster relief program that is already being \naddressed through the waiver process, $800 million in support for those \ncovered by private insurance, and changes to reimbursement rates for 29 \nStates, regardless of how they were or might have been impacted by \nthese hurricanes--I think all of those items call into question both \nthe structure and the timing of this legislation. I think we can do \nbetter.\n  I think there are a lot of questions as to how the $62 billion that \nhas already been committed is being spent. Other Members have raised \nthe question of working harder to find offsets so any additional \nspending will have a minimum impact on the deficit and the national \ndebt, which is a challenge and a\n\n[[Page S10419]]\n\ncrisis we are all going to be faced with today and in future \ngenerations as well. We do not want to create a future economic \ncatastrophe in our heartfelt efforts to deal with this natural disaster \ntoday.\n  There is no question that we need to provide assistance, that we \nshould provide assistance, and that the House and Senate will continue \nto provide assistance, in all likelihood, in addition to the $62 \nbillion we have already committed and the $9 billion in tax relief that \nhas been added to that. But we need to work very hard to make sure we \nknow how that money is being utilized. I think we should do everything \nin our power to allow some of those funds to be used for these critical \nhealth care costs. And we need to do much more to try to find ways to \ncover this additional spending so we do not increase the deficit and \nleave an unfortunate financial legacy for future generations.\n  I think my colleague's objection was warranted. I do not think being \nmore deliberative in addressing this legislation and reviewing this \nlegislation will hurt its efficacy and effectiveness in the long run. \nBut I do think it will serve the public and the country much better in \nthe long run to be as fiscally responsible as we possibly can in \naddressing these critical needs in the Gulf States.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/26/senate-section/article/S10419-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10419-S10420]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               OIL PRICES\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I introduced a piece of legislation a few \nweeks ago with my colleagues, Senator Dodd and Senator Boxer, dealing \nwith the issue of a windfall profits tax on the major integrated oil \ncompanies in this country. The proceeds of this profits tax would be \nused to give rebates back to consumers who are now paying extraordinary \nprices to fill up the tank of their car and will be paying \nextraordinary prices this winter for things such as natural gas and \nhome heating fuel.\n  Well, this proposal for a windfall profits tax in order to capture \nsome of that windfall or excess profits and move it back to consumers \nhas drawn a fair amount of criticism from, of course, one of the \nlargest and wealthiest industries in our country. I expect that and \nunderstand that.\n  An op-ed piece this past weekend by James Glassman is typical of \nthat. James Glassman is a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, \nand he wrote an article that said:\n  Look, the free market is working. The markets are working, he says. \nHe is very critical, of course, of the legislation I have introduced. \n``The markets are working.''\n  Well, I decided I would bring this over. This is the James Glassman, \nby the way, who wrote the book in year 2000, ``Dow 36000.'' He was \npredicting the Dow Jones Industrial Average was going to go to 36,000. \nIt did not quite work so well. But among the pundits here in \nWashington, DC, there is no such thing as trying to track back to find \nout who is right or wrong, you just keep writing. The Dow at 36,000? \nYeah?\n  The oil markets are working? Sure they are.\n  Let me show you what is happening with these markets.\n  First, this was in the Washington Post yesterday. It shows there is a \n46-percent increase in the price of a gallon of gasoline for the crude \noil producer since last September.\n  That is for the producers. It shows a 255-percent increase for \nrefiners over the past year. Incidentally, in most cases these are the \nsame companies. Because of the behemoth mergers of the 1990s, giant oil \ncompanies were formed. Many of these are integrated companies that do \neverything from pulling oil from the ground to putting it in the car.\n  What has happened? Well, let me give you some statistics.\n  The 10 largest oil companies earned revenues last year of over $1 \ntrillion and had net profits of over $100 billion. These are last \nyear's numbers. Exxon Mobil, the world's largest publicly traded oil \ncompany, earned more than $25 billion last year and spent $9.9 billion \nof it to buy back its stock. In addition, it has kept $18.5 billion in \ncash. Profits for the largest 10 oil companies jumped more than 30 \npercent last year over the year before.\n  Now, there is an exception to this, because these profits are going \nto look minuscule as compared to the profits they are getting this \nyear. The price of oil has gone up another $30 a barrel. It is $30 a \nbarrel above the record profits the major oil companies had last year.\n  So while people drive to the gas pump and pay through the nose, this \nnotion of ``fill 'er up'' no longer just pertains to the gas tank on \nthe car, it pertains to the treasuries of the major oil companies. And \nare they being filled up.\n  Now, what is happening with all of that money? Well, let me read a \nBusinessWeek article that says: ``Why Isn't Big Oil Drilling More?'' \nInteresting. One would expect, as Mr. Glassman argues: Gosh, if the oil \ncompanies can just get rich, they'll look for more oil. Everybody wins. \nRight?\n  BusinessWeek: ``Why Isn't Big Oil Drilling More?''\n  Well, the answer in the article was:\n\n        . . . by cutting the number of rivals, mergers have made \n     it easier for them to get away with that reluctance to spend.\n       Far from raising money to pursue opportunities, oil \n     companies are paying down debt, buying back shares, and \n     hoarding cash.\n       Rather than developing new fields, oil giants have \n     preferred to buy rivals--``drilling for oil on Wall Street,'' \n     as they call it.\n\n  So you have a massive amount of money that is going to the treasuries \nof the big oil companies. And they are ``drilling for oil on Wall \nStreet.''\n  Well, I have news for them. There ain't no oil on Wall Street. The \nmegamergers of the 1990s, the creation of these behemoth organizations \nnow have us in a situation where they are getting extraordinarily \nwealthy with, in my judgment, windfall or excess profits.\n  The American consumer is paying through the nose, and these companies \nare profiting beyond that which we have ever seen in corporate America.\n  Now, the Federal Trade Commission head says she doubts new laws \ndealing with profiteering would be effective. It is not surprising to \nme. The Federal Trade Commission, as a result of a provision I put in \nthe new energy bill that was signed by the President, is required by \nlaw to investigate the pricing of oil and gas. But do any of us think \nthis tiger without teeth called the Federal Trade Commission is very \ninterested in doing that? No.\n  And if you wonder, take a look at the writer's article of 22 \nSeptember 2005. Before they have even taken a hard look at all these \nthings, the chairman of the Federal Trade Commission is taking the \ntypical probusiness line.\n  Let me say this: The proposal we have offered for a windfall or \nexcess profits tax, and using it to provide a rebate to consumers, is \none that makes a lot of sense. This is not the old windfall profits tax \nof a couple decades ago.\n  This says: If the excess profits that integrated oil companies are \ngetting for selling a barrel of oil above $40 are being invested back \ninto the ground to develop the nation's energy supply or invested to \nbuild refineries, then they will not bear the burden of this recapture. \nOur proposal is simple: There will be no recapture and no tax if this \nwindfall profit is being used to explore for more oil or to increase \nrefinery capacity.\n\n  But I read to you the BusinessWeek article describing what they are \ndoing. What are they doing? They are using this extra money to buy back \ntheir shares of stock, to pay down their debt, to hoard cash--in \nExxon's case, in excess of $15 billion. Of course, that is a ready \nreserve with which to take a look at new companies to buy. That is the \nreference to ``drilling for oil on Wall Street.''\n  Well, I suppose there are many in this Congress, perhaps in this \nSenate, who share Mr. Glassman's views. After all, he comes from the \nAmerican Enterprise Institute. They hand out a lot of paper and kill a \nlot of trees to dispense information here in the Senate about the \nmarket system. But there is no free market in oil. What you have\n\n[[Page S10420]]\n\nwith respect to oil are a few OPEC countries in the Middle East whose \nministers sit around a big table and talk about production and price.\n  In addition to that, you now have behemoth oil companies that have \nthe capability to exercise much more impact on market prices and \nsupply. In addition to that, you have futures markets which are \nsupposed to provide liquidity but which now are playgrounds for \nspeculators. You have speculators. You have bigger oil companies. You \nhave the OPEC countries. And we have free marketers talking about a \nfree market? What are they smoking? There is no free market here.\n  What is happening is the American consumer is being taken advantage \nof. They are paying extraordinarily high prices for gasoline. While \npeople go to the gas pump and put 15 gallons of gas in their tank, and \npay $50 for it, and people this winter will have a 70-percent increase \nin natural gas prices for heating their home, we have some of the \nlargest corporations in this country profiting in an unusual, \nunwarranted way.\n  I say simply this: If these oil companies are using those profits to \nfind more oil, that is one thing. If they are not--and they are not; to \nwit, the article from BusinessWeek--then, in my judgment, some of that \nexcess or windfall profit ought to be recaptured and sent back to \nconsumers.\n  Let me say, my State produces oil. So I have some people in my State \nwho are a little cranky about what I proposed. I do not aim to hurt the \noil industry. If, in fact, there was a free market I would not be here. \nBut it is also true that consumers in my State are bearing the pain.\n  Let me describe my consumers in North Dakota. We drive exactly twice \nas much per person as New Yorkers do. We use twice as much gasoline per \nperson than the average New Yorker. Why is that the case? Well, in New \nYork, if they are going to see an aunt or an uncle in New Jersey, it is \na big trip. You pack an emergency kit. You go get your car serviced. \nYou talk about it for several months and then drive 40 miles to see the \nrelatives. That is a big deal out East.\n  Not in the Midwest, not in the northern Great Plains. Forty miles is \nnothing. People drive 200 miles one way for a meeting, and then drive \n200 miles back in the same day. That is why in our part of the country, \nin a State such as North Dakota that is 10 times the size of the State \nof Massachusetts in land mass with 640,000 people spread out over that \nland mass--we drive twice as much as New Yorkers.\n  What does that mean? Well, when the price of gasoline doubles, it \nhurts us twice as much as it does those in States where they do not use \ngasoline as much as we do.\n  So I recognize the oil industry would like to keep all this going: \n$3, $3.50 a gallon. By the way, this all started before there was any \nhurricane. I saw on the news last night a sophisticated news report \nabout all this, and it was linking the price of oil to the hurricanes. \nThe fact is, the price of oil was up over $30 a barrel above last \nyear's price--at which point you had record profits in the industry--\nlong before Hurricane Katrina. So this is not about hurricanes.\n  The question is, will Congress care? Will Congress do something about \nit? We spend a lot of time on things that do not have much of an impact \non the American people. I wonder if for a moment we can spend some time \non something that does. There is a tendency around here to treat \nserious things way too lightly, and then to treat light things way too \nseriously. This is a serious issue. A whole lot of folks cannot afford \nto pay this. They cannot pay the cost of $3-a-gallon gasoline or have a \n70-percent increase in natural gas prices or have a 40-percent increase \nin the price of home heating fuel to keep warm in the winter.\n  The question is, does Congress care? Does the Senate care? We will \nhave people come here in blue suits saying: This is a free market. This \nis not a free market. Again, if this were a free market, I would not be \non the floor talking about it. This is a market with clogged arteries, \nclogged in a manner that is horribly unfair to the average American, \nand clogged in a way that provides handsome profits, unparalleled \nprofits, to the oil industry.\n  But let me say, once again, lest others misrepresent what we are \nproposing, if that industry is using these profits to find oil in the \nground, or above ground on refineries to process oil, they would not be \naffected by a windfall profits tax. But if they are not--and they are \nnot, in most cases--then they would bear the burden of a recapture of a \nportion of these windfall or excess profits, and they would be sent \nback to the consumers in this country, as a matter of basic fairness.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/26/senate-section/article/S10420-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10420]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n               PRIVATE STAFF SERGEANT TRICIA LYNN JAMESON\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Madam President, I rise today to honor SSG \nTricia Lynn Jameson of Omaha, NE.\n  SSG Tricia Lynn Jameson was a dedicated soldier serving in the \nNational Guard for over 11 years. Originally born in Aurora, NE, she \nand her family moved to Omaha where Jameson became a 1989 graduate of \nMillard South High School. Jameson began her military career on July \n11, 1994, joining the Army National Guard as a medic.\n  Staff Sergeant Jameson was the epitome of a selfless individual, \nalways giving a hand to others. During a mission to the Treybul border \ncrossing on the Iraqi-Jordan border on July 14, 2005, an improvised \nexplosive device off the side of the road struck the M997 ambulance \nthat she commanded. Staff Sergeant Jameson bravely lost her life in \nthis attack, but she died as she lived, helping others no matter the \nrisk to herself, as she was on her way to assist injured marines who \nhad been wounded by an earlier device. Wanting to make a difference, \nStaff Sergeant Jameson was a volunteer in the 313th Medical Company, \nGA, in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. She was promoted to sergeant \nfirst class posthumously.\n  Giving her life to save others and to the cause of freedom, Staff \nSergeant Jameson was the finest example of courage. She is survived by \nher mother, Patricia, and brother, Robert, among many other friends, \nfamily, and fellow soldiers. I offer my heartfelt prayers and thoughts \nto Staff Sergeant Jameson's family. She made the ultimate and most \ncourageous sacrifice to spread freedom and hope and to defend liberty. \nShe was a person of incredible altruism, and both Americans and \nNebraskans alike will not forget what she gave to our great Nation.\n\n\n                      sergeant jason t. palmerton\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to honor SGT Jason T. Palmerton of \nAuburn, NE.\n  Sergeant Jason Palmerton had a desire to selflessly give his all to \nhis country. Born in Hamburg, IA, but growing up in Auburn, NE, he \ngraduated from Auburn High School in 1998. After several years doing \nmechanical maintenance in Lincoln, Palmerton decided to enlist in July \nof 2002, requesting to be in the most rigorously trained Special Forces \nGroup. Six weeks ago, after nearly 3 years of training, Sergeant \nPalmerton became a Green Beret and was deployed to Afghanistan with his \n12-man team.\n  At the age of 25, Sergeant Palmerton died on July 23, 2005, after \nsustaining bullet wounds on dismounted patrol during his service in \nOperation Enduring Freedom in Qal'eh-Yegaz, Afghanistan. He was a \nmember of the 1st Battalion, 3rd Special Forces Group based out of Fort \nBragg, NC. All Americans should honor Sergeant Palmerton's courage and \npatriotism as he aimed to become a highly trained Green Beret from his \nfirst days in boot camp, knowing both the difficulty and risk \nassociated with the achievement. For the past 6 weeks, he continued to \nserve bravely in the unstable and dangerous environment of southern \nAfghanistan.\n  Sergeant Palmerton left behind his fiancee, Shelley Austin, parents, \nand numerous other friends, family, and fellow soldiers. I offer my \nsincere condolences and prayers to Sergeant Palmerton's family. He gave \nhis life to save and honor the liberties of America, and his passion to \nachieve this end will long be remembered.\n  SGT Jason Palmerton's sacrifice is the essence of the American \nfreedom and he fought to save that freedom for all Nebraskans and \nAmericans alike.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/26/senate-section/article/S10420-2", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10420-S10421]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            THE PROMOTION OF MARINE CORPS GENERAL PETE PACE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, General Peter Pace will soon become the \nnext\n\n[[Page S10421]]\n\nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. There is no person more \ndeserving of this honor and more ready to take on this awesome \nresponsibility than General Pace, who has served the country with great \ndistinction in the Marine Corps for almost four decades. I know the \nentire Senate joins me in congratulating him and in extending all best \nwishes as he assumes his new post as the primary military adviser to \nthe Secretary of Defense and the President of the United States.\n  General Pace assumes the position at a difficult and a delicate time \nin our Nation's security situation. We are trying to bring political \nstability to Iraq, carrying out an intense counterinsurgency in a \ncountry rife with sectarian tensions and outright violence. The war in \nIraq and ongoing operations in Afghanistan are placing enormous stress \non our military's equipment, long-range planning, and, most \nimportantly, its people. Our defense forces are also heavily engaged in \nthe relief effort in the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. \nActive-Duty military personnel from each service are working closely \nwith the National Guard to help Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas to \nrecover from these catastrophes.\n  Yet if there is any military officer who will help the Nation's \nleaders understand the possibilities and limitations of military power \nin this ever-shifting international landscape, and mobilize our \ncapabilities to best effect, it is General Peter Pace. General Pace has \nan extraordinary background forged through his strength of character, \nsharpness of intellect, and generosity of heart. General Pace is also a \nstraight-talker, always speaking clearly and thoughtfully. He is a \nconsummate professional who will also serve as a true leader, adviser, \nand spokesperson for the Department of Defense.\n  The depth and strength of General Pace's qualities and capabilities \nalso come from his real-world experiences. Born in Brooklyn and raised \nin Teaneck, NJ, General Pace was commissioned in 1967. Soon after his \ngraduation from the U.S. Naval Academy, he embarked on his stellar \ncareer and service in the Marine Corps. He served heroically in \nVietnam, where he earned a Bronze Star in the line of fire.\n  As he rose through the ranks, General Pace has commanded recruiting \nstations and infantry battalions. At each posting he has brought a \nstrong sense of purpose, strength, and insight. He has also served as \nan executive officer and chief of staff to high level officers before \nbecoming one himself. In the early 1990s, he was deputy commander of \nour Marines in Somalia. In every one of his postings, higher ranking \nofficials have wisely recognized his talents and skills and sought to \nput them to use.\n  General Pace will become the first marine to serve as the Chairman of \nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff, just as he was the first marine to become \nthe Vice Chairman. As Vice Chairman, he served the President, Secretary \nof Defense Rumsfeld, and Chairman Richard Myers superbly, overseeing \nthe often complicated military requirements process and ensuring that \nthe enormous staff of the Joint Chiefs runs smoothly. As a member of \nthe Joint Chiefs, he contributed his wide-ranging insights and \nknowledge, as this important group tackled crises like the attacks of \nSeptember 11 and the war in Iraq.\n  General Pace is devoted to his family--his wife Lynne and two \nchildren, Peter and Tiffany Marie and my wife Marcelle and I have \nenjoyed the time we have spent with them. We know that part of the \ndignity and strength that the general will bring to this new position \ncomes from that incredible and invaluable family support.\n  I know that the entire Senate is proud of General Pete Pace and the \nSenate, like me, will want to wish him warm congratulations, deep \nappreciation and all best wishes in his new position.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/26/senate-section/article/S10421-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10421]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. SMITH.

In addition, full-year funding estimates under current\n  law are included for entitlement and mandatory programs requiring\n  annual appropriations even if the appropriations have not been made.\n\n\n TABLE 2.--SUPPORTING DETAIL FOR THE SENATE CURRENT-LEVEL REPORT FOR ON-BUDGET SPENDING AND REVENUES FOR FISCAL\n                                       YEAR 2006, AS OF SEPTEMBER 21, 2005\n                                            [In millions of dollars]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                          Budget Authority       Outlays            Revenues\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEnacted in Previous Sessions:\n    Revenues...........................................               n.a.               n.a.          1,607,650\n    Permanents and other spending legislation..........          1,297,743          1,254,376               n.a.\n    Appropriation legislation..........................                  0            382,272               n.a.\n    Offsetting receipts................................           -479,872           -479,872               n.a.\n                                                        --------------------------------------------------------\n        Total, enacted in previous sessions:...........            817,871          1,156,776          1,607,650\nEnacted This Session:\n    Authorizing Legislation:\n    TANF Extension Act of 2005 (P.L. 109-19)...........                148                165                  0\n    An act approving the renewal of import restrictions                  0                  0                 -1\n     contained in the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act\n     of2005 (P.L. 109-39)..............................\n    Dominican Republic-Central America-United States                    27                 27                 -3\n     Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (P.L. 109-\n     53).\n    Energy Policy Act of 2005 (P.L. 109-58)............                141                231               -588\n    Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient\n     Transportation Equity Act:\n        A Legacy for Users (P.L. 109-59)...............              3,444                 36                  9\n    National Flood Insurance Program Enhanced Borrowing              2,000              2,000                  0\n     Authority Act of 2005 (P.L. 109-65).\n    Pell Grant Hurricane and Disaster Relief Act (P.L.                   2                  2                  0\n     109-66)\n    TANF Emergency Response and Recovery Act of 2005                -4,965                105                  0\n     (P.L. 109-68)\n    Appropriation Acts:\n    Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for                      -39                -36                 11\n     Defense, the Global War on Terror, and Tsunami\n     Relief, 2005 (P.L. 109-13) \\2\\....................\n    Interior Appropriations Act, 2006 (P.L. 109-54)....             26,211             17,301                122\n    Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 2006 (P.L.                3,804              3,185                  0\n     109-55)...........................................\n                                                        --------------------------------------------------------\n        Total, enacted this session:...................             30,773             23,016               -450\nEntitlements and mandatories:\n    Difference between enacted levels and budget                   450,207            424,587               n.a.\n     resolution estimates for appropriated entitlements\n     and other mandatory programs......................\nTotal Current Level 1, 2...............................          1,298,851          1,604,379          1,607,200\nTotal Budget Resolution................................          2,144,384          2,161,420          1,589,892\n    Adjustment to budget resolution for emergency                  -50,000            -62,424               n.a.\n     requirements \\3\\..................................\nAdjusted Budget Resolution.............................          2,094,384          2,098,996               n.a.\nCurrent Level Over Adjusted Budget Resolution..........               n.a.               n.a.             17,308\nCurrent Level Under Adjusted Budget Resolution.........            795,533            494,617               n.a.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSOURCE: Congressional Budget Office.\nNOTES: n.a. = not applicable; P.L. = Public Law.\n\\1\\ Pursuant to section 402 of H.

Mr. President, I am pleased today to honor the birth of \none of Virginia's and America's true citizen soldiers, statesmen, and \nmost importantly jurists, the former Chief Justice of the United \nStates, John Marshall.\n  The 250th commemoration of his birth over the weekend takes on \nspecial significance this week as the Senate prepares to confirm John \nRoberts as the 17th Chief Justice of the United States. He will replace \nChief Justice William Rehnquist, whose decent, dedicated and principled \nleadership will be difficult to replace. I am confident that Judge \nRoberts will follow in the tradition of honorable service that was so \nevident in the work of former Chief Justices Rehnquist and Marshall.\n  John Marshall's legacy as a Federalist is truly remarkable, but what \nmany people fail to address is his true love for a young America and \nthe desire to see our country succeed and persevere for generations to \ncome.\n  A native Virginian, from Germantown, he grew up with his parents \nThomas and Mary Randolph Keith. His devotion to our Nation was ever \npresent when the Revolutionary War began with the firing of the \nhistoric shots at Lexington and Concord. Like so many of his great \ncountrymen, Marshall did not waver in spirit or succumb to fear; \nMarshall picked up arms against the tyrannical oppressive British Crown \nand defended the freedom and liberty that he envisioned for Virginians \nand other colonies.\n  At the young age of 20, Marshall joined the Culpeper Minute Men. He \nwas chosen a lieutenant. Marshall proceeded to nobly fight in the \nbattle of Great Bridge. In fact, while enduring the cold winter at \nValley Forge, Marshall was General George Washington's chief legal \nofficer and by the end of his military service, John Marshall was a \nbrigadier general for the Second Brigade in the Virginia Militia.\n  After his valiant war service, Marshall returned to Virginia to study \nlaw under George Wythe at the College of William and Mary. He was \nadmitted to Phi Beta Kappa and the Virginia Bar. Marshall's desire to \npractice in the courts and the court of appeals led him to the great \ncapital city of Richmond. It is in Richmond where Marshall's political \nand judicial life began to flourish.\n  John Marshall became one of the leading attorneys defending \nVirginians in the United States District Court of Virginia, and as a \nconsequence, he was selected to be the lead counsel in arguing the \nlandmark case, Ware v. Hylton, in the 1796 term of the United States \nSupreme Court. This would be the only case that John Marshall would \nargue before the Nation's highest court and, ironically, he lost.\n  Like his legal career, Marshall saw success in politics. He held \nlegislative office as a member of the Virginia House of Delegates, a \nmember of the Governor's Council of State, and finally as a member of \nthe United States House of Representatives. But one of his most \nimportant, yet often overlooked roles is his election to the Virginia \nconvention that ratified the Federal Constitution. Marshall rose and \ndelivered a very poignant speech on the role of the judiciary. This \nspeech dispelled many of the fears of a Federal court system and truly \ndefined his views on the proper function of government.\n  Nonetheless, John Marshall was not a boisterous individual. He \nrefused many attempts by President Adams to appoint him to Federal \noffice. But he accepted and served as a diplomatic envoy to France for \nPresident Adams as well as Adams' Secretary of State. It was his \ndedicated service as Secretary of State that led President Adams to \nappoint Marshall to the United States Supreme Court, where his legacy \nwould endure.\n  We all know the landmark cases that John Marshall decided. From \nMcCulloch v. Maryland to Gibbons v. Ogden, Marshall's contribution to \nthe American judiciary system is ever present. But the case that truly \nenshrines his legacy is his ruling in Marbury v. Madison. In truth, \nwhat made this even more impressive was that Marbury was the very first \ncase that the Supreme Court heard under the leadership of Chief Justice \nMarshall.\n  The Marshall Court's ruling in Marbury v. Madison has defined the \nrole of the Supreme Court and its pivotal place in our system of checks \nand balances. Although the decision limited the power of the Supreme \nCourt, it also served to establish the Court's authority to review the \nconstitutionality of acts of Congress. The doctrine of judicial review \nbecame a fundamental principle of Constitutional law.\n  While I am a Jeffersonian who wishes to limit the reach and meddling \nof the Federal Government into the rights and prerogatives of the \npeople and the States, I do believe these foundational Constitutional \nquestions, debates, and decisions are noteworthy for the education of \nour present leaders and students. By commemorating historical figures \nsuch as John Marshall, we will help our young people better understand \nAmerican history and what it means to be a citizen of the United \nStates. One thing is certain: John Marshall deserves a prominent place \nin this Nation's history for his life of service and the impact he made \non America even after death. It was, after all, Chief Justice \nMarshall's funeral that caused the famous crack in the Liberty Bell \nwhen it tolled for his procession in 1835. Indeed, John's Marshall's \nindelible mark in American lore came in many forms.\n  And so it is with great honor that I celebrate the birthday of one of \nour great citizen soldiers, statesmen, and Chief Justices. We should \ncelebrate John Marshall's contribution to our country. His steadfast \ncommitment to federalism helped define the role of the courts and may \nhave ultimately preserved the delicate equilibrium of our Government. \nBut what trumped his loyalty to the federalist way of life, was his \nlove for his Nation and his desire to see America flourish into the \ngreat country that it is today.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to wish a happy birthday to \nChief Justice John Marshall, who was born 250 years ago in the great \nCommonwealth of Virginia. May Virginia and America continue to be \nblessed with men and women of his unflinching character and spirit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/26/senate-section/article/S10423-2", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10423-S10424]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SIMON WIESENTHAL\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, there are many kinds of heroes in our \nworld.\n  Some create magnificent works of art which raise our spirits to \nnobler visions.\n  Some make tremendous scientific discoveries which revolutionize our \nunderstanding and our use of nature for human good.\n  Some reach unprecedented achievement by adventuring where humans have \nnever been before.\n  But today we are honoring the late Simon Wiesenthal, a different kind \nof hero who didn't achieve in the realm of beauty, science or \nadventure. His life achievement instead was to hold up to humanity the \ntruth about one of its ugliest chapters. He faced what is worst in \nhumankind, and triumphed over it.\n  In almost every culture the concept of justice begins with finding \nthe truth. Simon Wiesenthal was a principled and indefatigable pursuer \nof the truth of the Nazi holocaust. He was not content to let the stain \nof the Nazi murder of Jews and others to be washed away with the \npassage of time. He sought to document their acts so that they could be \nrecorded forever.\n  But his life's work went beyond finding the truth. He traveled the \nglobe to make sure surviving members of the Third Reich were held \naccountable for their monstrous crimes.\n  He summed up his life with the words ``Never forget. Never again.'' \nHe made us recognize that the simple act of forgetting opened the door \nfor the unthinkable to recur.\n  World history tells us that every terrible evil starts small and \ngrows to the point where it cannot be controlled except by \nextraordinary means and cost.\n  Simon Wiesenthal's life teaches us to deal with anti-Semitism \nwherever it rears its head so that we don't allow it to grow into \nsomething we can no longer stop.\n  He urged us not only to face the truth, but to act upon it.\n  Centuries ago a Spanish Rabbi named Maimomedes said this:\n\n       Each of us should view ourselves as if the world were held \n     in balance and a single act of goodness may tip the scales.\n\n  Simon Wiesenthal did countless acts of goodness and tipped the scales \nof\n\n[[Page S10424]]\n\nworld history and we honor him for that. But he also places a burden on \nall of us, for posterity's sake, to do our part, to raise our voices \nand to take action whenever we see hatred rear its head.\n  We honor him best by devoting ourselves to the work of justice and \naction he accomplished.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/26/senate-section/article/S10424-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10424]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following bill was read the second time, and placed on the \ncalendar:\n\n       S. 1761.

A bill to require the Federal Communications Commission to \nreevaluate the band plans for the upper 700 megaHertz band and the un-\nauctioned portions of the lower 700 megaHertz band and reconfigure them \nto include spectrum to be licensed for small geographic areas; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today with the support of many of my \ncolleagues on the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation to \nintroduce legislation to encourage the deployment of next generation \nwireless services in rural areas. Cell phones have become a vital part \nof so many lives. Today, there are over 194 million wireless \nsubscribers in the United States--a subscribership that continues to \ngrow. I want to be sure we foster an environment where this technology \nand future wireless technologies can flourish.\n  Along with mobility, convenience and safety, cell phones today also \nhave benefits of information access and entertainment. While wireless \nphones have been rapidly adopted by the general public, wireless \nservice is far from being without flaws. I myself become frustrated \nwhile home in Maine when I cannot get cell phone and blackberry \nservice. Something must be done in order to improve the wireless \nservices that so many people rely on.\n  Wireless services, such as cell phones, wireless handheld devices and \nsome Internet services utilize frequencies on the radio spectrum to \ntransfer voice and data from one user to another. It is the job of the \nservice provider to turn these airwaves into the valuable services that \nconsumers demand. The quality of service in a given place depends on \nhow much investment the service provider has put into infrastructure. \nMore urban locations tend to have better service because the return on \ninvestment is much higher due to the concentration of customers. This \ndoes not mean that rural areas are left without service. Viable \nbusiness models exist that can sustain service in these more remote \nlocations. Oftentimes smaller, local wireless companies can serve these \nareas better than nationwide service providers.\n  One of the greatest barriers to entry in the wireless industry is \nacquiring a spectrum license in which a service can be operated. \nCompanies bid up to billions of dollars for rights to one of Nation's \nmost important resources. The digital television transition will soon \nrelease new spectrum into the marketplace. Currently, the Federal \nCommunications Commission is slated to auction off the spectrum in \nlicenses that cover large geographic areas. While this may be the \npreferred size for national wireless carriers, smaller companies will \nbe unable to compete in the bidding process.\n  The bill I introduce today aims to address this problem by directing \nthe Federal Communications Commission to reevaluate its current \nbandplan for the 700 MHz spectrum that will be auctioned as a result of \nthe digital television transition. In this reevaluation, the FCC must \ndivide some of the frequency allocations into smaller area licenses so \nthat local and regional wireless companies can have an opportunity to \ncompete in the bidding process. The proper balance of large and small \nlicenses will encourage the deployment of advanced services throughout \nall parts of the United States.\n  This bill is not meant to circumvent the expertise of the Federal \nCommunications Commission. It merely directs the FCC to use its \nexpertise to develop a plan that will benefit the entire nation. Rural \nAmerica deserves the same benefits of wireless technologies that are \navailable in urban areas. This Act gives those best able to serve \nremote areas the tools needed to deploy services.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Allen, \n        Mr. Grassley, Mr. Schumer, and Mr. Feingold):\n  S. 1768. A bill to permit the televising of Supreme Court \nproceedings; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition to introduce \nlegislation that will give the public greater access to our Supreme \nCourt. This bill requires the high Court to permit television coverage \nof its open sessions unless it decides by a vote of the majority of \nJustices that allowing such coverage in a particular case would violate \nthe due process rights of one or more of the parties involved in the \nmatter.\n  The purpose of this legislation is to open the Supreme Court doors so \nthat more Americans can see the process by which the Court reaches \ncritical decisions of law that affect this country and everyday \nAmericans. Because the Supreme Court of the United States holds power \nto decide cutting-edge questions on public policy, thereby effectively \nbecoming a virtual ``super legislature,'' the public has a right to \nknow what the Supreme Court is doing. And that right would be \nsubstantially enhanced by televising the oral arguments of the Court so \nthat the public can see and hear the issues presented to the Court. \nWith this information, the public would have insight into key issues \nand be better equipped to understand the impact of the Court's \ndecisions.\n  In a very fundamental sense, televising the Supreme Court has been \nimplicitly recognized--perhaps even sanctioned--in a 1980 decision by \nthe Supreme Court of the United States entitled Richmond Newspapers v. \nVirginia. In this case, the Supreme Court noted that a public trial \nbelongs not only to the accused, but to the public and the press as \nwell; and that people now acquire information on court procedures \nchiefly through the print and electronic media.\n  That decision, in referencing the electronic media, appears to \nanticipate televising court proceedings, although I do not mean to \nsuggest that the Supreme Court is in agreement with this legislation. I \nshould note that the Court could, on its own motion, televise its \nproceedings but has chosen not to do so, which presents, in my view, \nthe necessity for legislating on this subject.\n  When I argued the case of the Navy Yard, Dalton v. Specter, back in \n1994, the Court proceedings were illustrated by an artist's drawings. \nNow, however, the public gets a substantial portion, if not most, of \nits information from television and the internet. While many court \nproceedings are broadcast routinely on television, the public has \nlittle access to the most important and highest court in this country. \nThe public must either rely on the print media, or stand in long lines \noutside the Supreme Court in Washington DC in order to get a brief \nglimpse of the open session from the public gallery.\n  Justice Felix Frankfurter perhaps anticipated the day when Supreme \nCourt arguments would be televised when he said that he longed for a \nday when: The news media would cover the Supreme Court as thoroughly as \nit did the World Series, since the public confidence in the judiciary \nhinges on the\n\n[[Page S10427]]\n\npublic's perception of it, and that perception necessarily hinges on \nthe media's portrayal of the legal system.\n  When I spoke in favor of this legislation in September of 2000, I \nsaid, ``I do not expect a rush to judgment on this very complex \nproposition, but I do believe the day will come when the Supreme Court \nof the United States will be televised. That day will come, and it will \nbe decisively in the public interest so the public will know the \nmagnitude of what the Court is deciding and its role in our democratic \nprocess.'' Today, I believe the time has come and that this legislation \nis crucial to the public's awareness of Supreme Court proceedings and \ntheir impact on the daily lives of all Americans.\n  I pause to note that it was not until 1955 that the Supreme Court, \nunder the leadership of Chief Justice Warren, first began permitting \naudio recordings of oral arguments. Between 1955 and 1993, there were \napparently over 5,000 recorded arguments before the Supreme Court. That \nroughly translates to an average of about one hundred thirty two (132) \narguments annually. But audio recordings are simply ill suited to \ncapture the nuance of oral arguments and the sustained attention of the \nAmerican citizenry. Nor is it any response that people who wish to see \nopen sessions of the Supreme Court should come to the Capital and \nattend oral arguments. For, according to one source: Several million \npeople each year visit Washington, D.C., and many thousands tour the \nWhite House and the Capital. But few have the chance to sit in the \nSupreme Court chamber and witness an entire oral argument. Most \ntourists are given just three minutes before they are shuttled out and \na new group shuttled in. In cases that attract headlines, seats for the \npublic are scarce and waiting lines are long. And the Court sits in \nopen session less than two hundred hours each year. Television cameras \nand radio microphones are still banned from the chamber, and only a few \nhundred people at most can actually witness oral arguments. Protected \nby a marble wall from public access, the Supreme Court has long been \nthe least understood of the three branches of our federal government.\n  In light of the increasing public desire for information, it seems \nuntenable to continue excluding cameras from the courtroom of the \nNation's highest court. As one legal commentator observes: An effective \nand legitimate way to satisfy America's curiosity about the Supreme \nCourt's holdings, Justices, and modus operandi is to permit broadcast \ncoverage of oral arguments and decision announcements from the \ncourtroom itself.\n  Televised court proceedings better enable the public to understand \nthe role of the Supreme Court and its impact on the key decisions of \nthe day. Not only has the Supreme Court invalidated Congressional \ndecisions where there is, in the views of many, simply a difference of \nopinion to what is preferable public policy, but the Court determines \nnovel issues such as whether AIDS is a disability under the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act, whether Congress can ban obscenity from the \nInternet, and whether states can impose term limits upon members of \nCongress. The current Court, like its predecessors, hands down \ndecisions which vitally affect the lives of all Americans. Since the \nCourt's historic 1803 decision, Marbury v. Madison, the Supreme Court \nhas the final authority on issues of enormous importance from birth to \ndeath. In Roe v. Wade (1973), the Court affirmed a Constitutional right \nto abortion in this country and struck down state statutes banning or \nseverely restricting abortion during the first two trimesters on the \ngrounds that they violated a right to privacy inherent in the Due \nProcess Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In the case of Washington \nv. Glucksberg (1997), the court refused to create a similar right to \nassisted suicide. Here the Court held that the Due Process Clause does \nnot recognize a liberty interest that includes a right to commit \nsuicide with another's assistance.\n\n  In the seventies, the Court first struck down then upheld state \nstatutes imposing the death penalty for certain crimes. In Furman v. \nGeorgia (1972), the Court struck down Georgia's death penalty statute \nunder the cruel and unusual punishment clause of the Eighth Amendment \nand stated that no death penalty law could pass constitutional muster \nunless it took aggravating and mitigating circumstances into account. \nThis decision led Georgia and many states to amend their death penalty \nstatutes and, four years later, in Gregg v. Georgia (1976), the Supreme \nCourt upheld Georgia's amended death penalty statute.\n  Over the years, the Court has also played a major role in issues of \nwar and peace. In its opinion in Scott v. Sanford (1857)--better known \nas the Dredd Scott decision--the Supreme Court held that Dredd Scott, a \nslave who had been taken into ``free'' territory by his owner, was \nnevertheless still a slave. The Court further held that Congress lacked \nthe power to abolish slavery in certain territories, thereby \ninvalidating the careful balance that had been worked out between the \nNorth and the South on the issue. Historians have noted that this \nopinion fanned the flames that led to the Civil War.\n  The Supreme Court has also ensured adherence to the Constitution \nduring more recent conflicts. Prominent opponents of the Vietnam War \nrepeatedly petitioned the Court to declare the Presidential action \nunconstitutional on the grounds that Congress had never given the \nPresident a declaration of war. The Court decided to leave this \nconflict in the political arena and repeatedly refused to grant writs \nof certiorari to hear these cases. This prompted Justice Douglas, \nsometimes accompanied by Justices Stewart and Harlan, to take the \nunusual step of writing lengthy dissents to the denials of cert.\n  In New York Times Co. v. United States (1971)--the so called \n``Pentagon Papers'' case--the Court refused to grant the government \nprior restraint to prevent the New York Times from publishing leaked \nDefense Department documents which revealed damaging information about \nthe Johnson Administration and the war effort. The publication of these \ndocuments by the New York Times is believed to have helped move public \nopinion against the war.\n  In its landmark civil rights opinions, the Supreme Court took the \nlead in effecting needed social change, helping us to address \nfundamental questions about our society in the courts rather than in \nthe streets. In Brown v. Board of Education, the Court struck down the \nprinciple of ``separate but equal'' education for blacks and whites and \nintegrated public education in this country. This case was then \nfollowed by a series of civil rights cases which enforced the concept \nof integration and full equality for all citizens of this country, \nincluding Garner v. Louisiana, 1961, Burton v. Wilmington Parking \nAuthority, 1961, and Peterson v. City of Greenville, 1963.\n  In recent years Marbury, Dred Scott, Furman, New York Times, and Roe, \nfamiliar names in the lexicon of lawyerly discussions concerning \nwatershed Supreme Court precedents, have been joined with similarly \nimportant cases like Hamdi, Rasul and Roper all cases that affect \nfundamental individual rights. In Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, 2004, the Court \nconcluded that although Congress authorized the detention of \ncombatants, due process demands that a citizen held in the United \nStates as an enemy combatant be given a meaningful opportunity to \ncontest the factual basis for that detention before a neutral \ndecisionmaker. The Court reaffirmed the nation's commitment to \nconstitutional principles even during times of war and uncertainty. \nSimilarly, in Rasul v. Bush, 2004, the Court held that the federal \nhabeas statute gave district courts jurisdiction to hear challenges of \naliens held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba in the U.S. War on Terrorism. \nEarlier this year in Roper v. Simmons, 2005, the Court held that \nexecutions of individuals who were under 18 years of age at the time of \ntheir capital crimes is prohibited by Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.\n  In June of this year, the Supreme Court issued Kelo v. City of New \nLondon, 2005, a highly controversial opinion in which a majority of the \njustices held that a city's exercise of eminent domain power in \nfurtherance of an economic development plan satisfied the \nConstitution's Fifth Amendment ``public use'' requirement despite \nthe absence of any blight. Moreover, on June 27, 2005, the High Court \nissued two rulings regarding the public display of the Ten \nCommandments. Each opinion was backed by a different coalition of four, \nwith Justice Breyer as the swing vote.\n\n[[Page S10428]]\n\nThe only discernible rule seems to be that the Ten Commandments may be \ndisplayed outside a public courthouse, Van Orden v. Perry, but not \ninside (McCreary County v. American Civil Liberties Union) and may be \ndisplayed with other documents, but not alone. In Van Orden v. Perry, \nthe Supreme Court permitted a display of the Ten Commandments to remain \non the grounds outside the Texas State Capitol. However, in McCreary \nCounty v. ACLU, a bare majority of Supreme Court Justices ruled that \ntwo Kentucky counties violated the Establishment Clause by erecting \ndisplays of the Ten Commandments indoors for the purpose of advancing \nreligion. While the multiple concurring and dissenting opinions in \nthese cases serve to explain some of the confounding differences in \noutcomes, it would have been extraordinarily fruitful for the American \npublic to watch the Justices as they grappled with these issues during \noral arguments that, presumably, reveal much more of their deliberative \nprocesses than mere text.\n\n  Irrespective of ones view concerning the merits of these decisions, \nit is clear beyond cavil that they have a profound effect on the \ninterplay between the government, on the one hand, and the individual \non the other. So, it is with these watershed decisions in mind that I \nintroduce legislation designed to make the Supreme Court less esoteric \nand more accessible to common men and women who are so clearly affected \nby its decisions.\n  When deciding issues of such great national import, the Supreme Court \nis rarely unanimous. In fact, a large number of seminal Supreme Court \ndecisions have been reached through a vote of 5-4. Such a close margin \nreveals that these decisions are far from foregone conclusions \ndistilled from the meaning of the Constitution and legal precedents. On \nthe contrary, these major Supreme Court opinions embody critical \ndecisions reached on the basis of the preferences and views of each \nindividual justice. In a case that is decided by a vote of 5-4, an \nindividual justice has the power by his or her vote to change the law \nof the land.\n  Some would argue that the Court has even played a significant role in \ndeciding political contests as well. Who can forget the Court's \ndramatic decision in Bush v. Gore that enabled the country to move on \nfrom a bitterly fought presidential race. That decision, with its \nenormous repercussions for the Nation, cried out for greater public \nscrutiny of the process by which the Justices heard arguments and all \nbut decided the fate of the 2000 presidential race.\n  Given the enormous significance of each vote cast by each Justice on \nthe Supreme Court, televising the proceedings of the Supreme Court will \nallow sunlight to shine brightly on these proceedings and ensure \ngreater public awareness and scrutiny.\n  In a democracy, the workings of the government at all levels should \nbe open to public view. With respect to oral arguments, the more \nopenness and the more real the opportunity for public observation the \ngreater the understanding and trust. As the Supreme Court observed in \nthe 1986 case of Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court, ``People in an \nopen society do not demand infallibility from their institutions, but \nit is difficult for them to accept what they are prohibited from \nobserving.''\n  It was in this spirit that the House of Representatives opened its \ndeliberations to meaningful public observation by allowing C-SPAN to \nbegin televising debates in the House chamber in 1979. The Senate \nfollowed the House's lead in 1986 by voting to allow television \ncoverage of the Senate floor.\n  Beyond this general policy preference for openness, however, there is \na strong argument that the Constitution requires that television \ncameras be permitted in the Supreme Court.\n  It is well established that the Constitution guarantees access to \njudicial proceedings to the press and the public. In 1980, the Supreme \nCourt relied on this tradition when it held in Richmond Newspapers v. \nVirginia that the right of a public trial belongs not just to the \naccused, but to the public and the press as well. The Court noted that \nsuch openness has ``long been recognized as an indisputable attribute \nof an Anglo-American trial.''\n  Recognizing that in modern society most people cannot physically \nattend trials, the Court specifically addressed the need for access by \nmembers of the media: Instead of acquiring information about trials by \nfirst hand observation or by word of mouth from those who attended, \npeople now acquire it chiefly through the print and electronic media. \nIn a sense, this validates the media claim of acting as surrogates for \nthe public. [Media presence] contributes to public understanding of the \nrule of law and to comprehension of the functioning of the entire \ncriminal justice system.\n\n  To be sure, a strong argument can be made that forbidding television \ncameras in the court, while permitting access to print and other media, \nconstitutes an impermissible discrimination against one type of media \nover another. In recent years, the Supreme Court and lower courts have \nrepeatedly held that differential treatment of different media is \nimpermissible under the First Amendment absent an overriding \ngovernmental interest. For example, in 1983 the Court invalidated \ndiscriminatory tax schemes imposed only upon certain types of media in \nMinneapolis Star & Tribune Co. v. Minnesota Commissioner of Revenue. In \nthe 1977 case of ABC v. Cuomo, the Second Circuit rejected the \ncontention by the two candidates for mayor of New York that they could \nexclude some members of the media from their campaign headquarters by \nproviding access through invitation only. The Court wrote that: Once \nthere is a public function, public comment, and participation by some \nof the media, the First Amendment requires equal access to all of the \nmedia or the rights of the First Amendment would no longer be tenable.\n  In the 1965 case of Estes v. Texas, the Supreme Court rejected the \nargument that the denial of television coverage of trials violates the \nequal protection clause. In the same opinion, the Court held that the \npresence of television cameras in the Court had violated a Texas \ndefendant's right to due process. Subsequent opinions have cast serious \ndoubt upon the continuing relevance of both prongs of the Estes \nopinion.\n  In its 1981 opinion in Chandler v. Florida, the court recognized that \nEstes must be read narrowly in light of the state of television \ntechnology at that time. The television coverage of Estes' 1962 trial \nrequired cumbersome equipment, numerous additional microphones, yards \nof new cables, distracting lighting, and numerous technicians present \nin the courtroom. In contrast, the court noted, television coverage in \n1980 can be achieved through the presence of one or two discreetly \nplaced cameras without making any perceptible change in the atmosphere \nof the courtroom. Accordingly, the Court held that, despite Estes, the \npresence of television cameras in a Florida trial was not a violation \nof the rights of the defendants in that case. By the same logic, the \nholding in Estes that exclusion of television cameras from the courts \ndid not violate the equal protection clause must be revisited in light \nof the dramatically different nature of television coverage today.\n  Given the strength of these arguments, it is not surprising that over \nthe last two decades there has been a rapidly growing acceptance of \ncameras in American courtrooms which has reached almost every court \nexcept for the Supreme Court itself. Ironically, it was the Chandler \ndecision which helped spur the spread of television cameras in the \ncourts. Shortly after Chandler, the American Bar Association revised \nits canons to permit judges to authorize televising civil and criminal \nproceedings in their courts.\n  Following the green lights provided by the Supreme Court and the ABA, \nnearly all the States have decided to permit electronic coverage of at \nleast some portion of their judicial proceedings. In 1990, the Federal \nJudicial Conference authorized a three-year pilot program allowing \ntelevision coverage of civil proceedings in six federal district courts \nand two federal circuit courts. The program began in July, 1991, and \nran through December 31, 1994. The Federal Judicial Center monitored \nthe program and issued a positive final evaluation. In particular, the \nJudicial Center concluded that: Overall, attitudes of judges toward \nelectronic media coverage of civil proceedings were initially neutral \nand became more favorable after experience under the pilot program.\n\n[[Page S10429]]\n\n  The Judicial Center also concluded that: Judges and attorneys who had \nexperience with electronic media coverage under the program generally \nreported observing small or no effects of camera presence on \nparticipants in the proceedings, courtroom decorum, or the \nadministration of justice.\n  Despite this positive evaluation, the Judicial Conference voted in \nSeptember 1994, to end the experiment and not to extend the camera \ncoverage to all courts. This decision was made in the aftermath of the \ninitial burst of television coverage of O.J. Simpson's pretrial \nhearing. Some have argued that the decision was unduly influenced by \nthis outside event. In March 1996, the Judicial Conference revisited \nthe issue of television cameras in the federal courts and voted to \npermit each Federal court of appeals to ``decide for itself whether to \npermit the taking of photographs and radio and television coverage of \nappellate arguments.'' Since that time, two circuit courts have enacted \nrules permitting television coverage of their arguments. It is \nsignificant to note that these two circuits were the two circuits which \nparticipated in the federal experiment with television cameras a few \nyears earlier. It seems that once judges have an experience with \ncameras in their courtroom, they no longer oppose the idea.\n\n  On September 6, 2000, the Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee \non Administrative Oversight and the Courts held a hearing titled \n``Allowing Cameras and Electronic Media in the Courtroom.'' The primary \nfocus of the hearing was Senate bill S. 721, legislation introduced by \nSenators Grassley and Schumer that would give Federal judges the \ndiscretion to allow television coverage of court proceedings. One of \nthe witnesses at the hearing, Judge Edward Becker, Chief Judge U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the Third Circuit, spoke in opposition to the \nlegislation and the presence of television cameras in the courtroom. \nThe remaining five witnesses, however, including a Federal judge, a \nState judge, a law professor and other legal experts, all testified in \nfavor of the legislation. They argued that cameras in the courts would \nnot disrupt proceedings but would provide the kind of accountability \nand access that is fundamental to our system of government.\n  In my judgment, Congress, with the concurrence of the President, or \noverriding his veto, has the authority to require the Supreme Court to \ntelevise its proceedings. Such a conclusion is not free from doubt and \nis highly likely to be tested with the Supreme Court, as usual, having \nthe final word. As I see it, there is clearly no constitutional \nprohibition against such legislation.\n  Article 3 of the Constitution states that the judicial power of the \nUnited States shall be vested ``in one Supreme Court and such inferior \nCourts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish.'' \nWhile the Constitution specifically creates the Supreme Court, it left \nit to Congress to determine how the Court would operate. For example, \nit was Congress that fixed the number of justices on the Supreme Court \nat nine. Likewise, it was Congress that decided that any six of these \njustices are sufficient to constitute a quorum of the Court. It was \nCongress that decided that the term of the Court shall commence on the \nfirst Monday in October of each year, and it was Congress that \ndetermined the procedures to be followed whenever the Chief Justice is \nunable to perform the duties of his office.\n  Beyond such basic structural and operational matters, Congress also \ncontrols more substantive aspects of the Supreme Court. Most \nimportantly, it is Congress that in effect determines the appellate \njurisdiction of the Supreme Court. Although the Constitution itself \nsets out the appellate jurisdiction of the Court, it provides that such \njurisdiction exist ``with such exceptions and under such regulations as \nthe Congress shall make.'' In the early days of the Supreme Court, \nChief Justice Marshall, writing for the Court in Durousseau v. United \nStates, recognized that the power to make exceptions to the Court's \njurisdiction is the equivalent of the power to grant jurisdiction, \nsince exceptions can be ``implied from the intent manifested by the \naffirmative description [of jurisdiction].''\n  The Supreme Court recognized the power of Congress to control its \nappellate jurisdiction in a dramatic way in the famous 1868 case of Ex \nParte McCardle. In this case, McCardle, a newspaper editor, was being \nheld in custody by the military for trial on charges stemming from the \npublication of articles alleged to be libelous and incendiary. McCardle \npetitioned the Supreme Court for a writ of habeas corpus. The Court \nheard his case but, before it rendered its opinion, Congress repealed \nthe statute that gave the Supreme Court jurisdiction to hear the habeas \nappeal. In light of this Congressional action, the Supreme Court felt \ncompelled to dismiss the case for lack of jurisdiction.\n  Some objections have been raised to televised proceedings of the \nSupreme Court on the ground that it would subject justices to undue \nsecurity risks. My own view is such concerns are vastly overstated. \nWell-known members of Congress, walk on a regular basis in public view \nin the Capitol complex. Other very well-known personalities, \npresidents, vice presidents, cabinet officers, all are on public view \nwith even incumbent presidents exposed to risks as they mingle with the \npublic. Such risks are minimal in my view given the relatively minor \nexposure that Supreme Court justices would undertake through television \nappearances.\n  As I explained earlier, the Supreme Court could, of course, permit \ntelevision through its own rule but has decided not to do so. Congress \nshould be circumspect and even hesitant to impose a rule mandating the \ntelevising of Supreme Court proceedings and should do so only in the \nface of compelling public policy reasons. The Supreme Court has such a \ndominant role in key decision-making functions that their proceedings \nought to be better known to the public; and, in the absence of Court \nrule, public policy would be best served by enactment of legislation \nrequiring the televising of Supreme Court proceedings.\n  This legislation embodies sound policy and will prove valuable to the \npublic. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objective, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1768\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. AMENDMENT TO TITLE 28.\n\n       (a) In General.--Chapter 45 of title 28, United States \n     Code, is amended by inserting at the end the following:\n\n     ``Sec. 678. Televising Supreme Court proceedings\n\n       ``The Supreme Court shall permit television coverage of all \n     open sessions of the Court unless the Court decides, by a \n     vote of the majority of justices, that allowing such coverage \n     in a particular case would constitute a violation of the due \n     process rights of 1 or more of the parties before the \n     Court.''.\n       (b) Clerical Amendment.--The chapter analysis for chapter \n     45 of title 28, United States Code, is amended by inserting \n     at the end the following:\n\n``678. Televising Supreme Court proceedings.''.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I am pleased to join Senator Specter as a cosponsor of \nthis bill that would require the televising of Supreme Court \nproceedings.\n  In the Senate Judiciary Committee, we recently conducted open \nhearings on the nomination of John G. Roberts to be Chief Justice of \nthe United States. We raised this matter with Judge Roberts. I have \nlong believed in sunshine in government. Our democracy works best when \nour citizens have access to their government. I have supported efforts \nto make all three branches of our Federal Government more accessible. \nExcept for rare closed sessions, the proceedings Congress and its \ncommittees are open to the public and carried live on cable television \nand radio. In addition, Members and committees are using the Internet \nand Web sites to make their work available to their constituencies and \nthe general public.\n  The work of executive branch agencies is subject to public scrutiny \nthrough the Freedom of Information Act, among other mechanisms. Despite \nthe current administration's dramatic shift toward excessive secrecy, \nthe Freedom of Information Act remains a cornerstone of democracy. It \nestablishes the right of Americans to know what their government is \ndoing--or not doing. As President Johnson said in\n\n[[Page S10430]]\n\n1966, when he signed the Freedom of Information Act into law:\n\n       This legislation springs from one of our most essential \n     principles: A democracy works best when the people have all \n     the information the security of the Nation permits.\n\n  Although most judicial proceedings are open to those who can travel \nto the courthouse and wait in line, emerging technology allows the \nopportunity to invite the rest of the country into the courtroom. All \n50 States have allowed some form of audio or video coverage of court \nproceedings, but Federal courts lag behind. Previously, I have \ncosponsored several bills with Senator Grassley to address this, \nincluding the Sunshine in the Courtroom Act of 2005.\n  The legislation I am cosponsoring today extends the tradition of \nopenness to the Nation's highest Court and can help Americans be better \ninformed about the important decisions that are made there and how they \nare made. This bill requires the Supreme Court to permit television \ncoverage of all open sessions of the Court. At the same time, it \nprotects the parties from violation of their due process rights by \npermitting a majority of the Justices to suspend this coverage for a \nparticular session if due process requires.\n  In 1994, the Judicial Conference concluded that the time was not ripe \nto permit cameras in the Federal courts, and rejected a recommendation \nof the Court Administration and Case Management Committee to authorize \nthe photographing, recording, and broadcasting of civil proceedings in \nFederal trial and appellate courts.\n  The Supreme Court is often the final arbiter of constitutional \nquestions and represents the ultimate protection of individual rights \nand liberties. Allowing the public greater access to its public \nproceedings will allow Americans to evaluate for themselves the quality \nof justice in this country, and deepen their understanding of the work \nthat goes on in the Court.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ENZI (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Alexander, Mr. Dodd, \n        Mr. Burr, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. DeWine, and Mrs. Clinton):\n  S. 1769. A bill to provide re1ief to individuals and businesses \naffected by Hurricane Katrina related to healthcare and health \ninsurance coverage, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to provide \nsolutions to the health care challenges wrought by Hurricane Katrina. \nAs chairman of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, \nI am proud to be joined by my friend Senator Kennedy, the ranking \nminority member of the committee, in introducing this legislation. I am \nalso honored that several fellow committee members are sponsoring this \nbill as well, including Senators Alexander, Dodd, Burr, Mikulski, \nDeWine, and Clinton. This bill is truly committee product in the best \nsense of the term.\n  We are introducing this legislation in response to the information \nthat has been shared with us from a variety of sources. Some of the \nprovisions of this bill were added as a result of the testimony that we \nreceived during a roundtable discussion before the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pensions. Others spring from the suggestions that \nwere forwarded to us or were posted on our committee's Web site. Others \ncame from our discussions with local, State and Federal officials who \nshared their firsthand knowledge and experience with us. Still others \nwere added as a result of our visit to the area. This legislation will \nnot accomplish everything that must be done, but it will provide \nanother valuable step in the effort to provide a comprehensive package \nto address the needs of those whose lives were forever changed by the \nwrath of Hurricane Katrina.\n  Just a few days ago, several of my colleagues and I traveled to the \nNew Orleans area to see the damage that was done by the storm for \nourselves. I don't think any of us were fully prepared for what we saw. \nAs startling as the images were that we had seen in the paper and on \ntelevision, they didn't fully portray what had happened and the reality \nthat confronted us on the ground. The devastation that the storm had \nbrought to the lives of those who lived there was readily apparent. It \nwas a tragedy that was even worse than any of us had thought was \npossible. It will not be easy to use the limited resources we have at \nour disposal to meet the almost unlimited need, but we are all \ndetermined to try.\n  Nationwide, there are people from the gulf coast region spread \nthroughout the country who have had to rely on the kindness and \ngoodwill of people they have never met before. Wyoming and so many \nother States have welcomed these people with open arms and open hearts. \nSeeing so many Americans, from all walks of life, respond as they have \nand reach out to other Americans in need, gives me a clearer picture \nthan I have ever seen before of what is right with America. It is a \nscene that gives me confidence that we will be able to rebuild what was \nlost and breathe new life into the communities that were devastated by \nthe storm.\n  Now, here in Congress, we will continue to do our part, and one of \nthe most important things we can do is to assure mothers and fathers \nall over the country that the health care needs of their family will be \nmet, that they will not have to go without or navigate through a \ncomplex bureaucracy to get the care they need, and that their Federal \nGovernment has the necessary authority to respond to this crisis.\n  The Public Health and Health Insurance Emergency Response Act of 2005 \nwill strengthen and improve America's ability to address the ongoing \npublic health and mental health needs faced by the hundreds of \nthousands of people displaced by Hurricane Katrina. It will also help \nthose evacuees and their employers continue to afford their health \ninsurance premiums as they put their lives and their businesses back \ntogether.\n  As we know, the public health emergency created by Hurricane Katrina \nwill take months to resolve. That means we need to cut whatever Federal \nredtape might stand in the way of a long-term public health recovery \neffort.\n  In this legislation, therefore, we strengthen the authority of the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services to waive laws that hinder the \nfullest possible response to a major disaster like Hurricane Katrina. \nThese laws include vaccination eligibility laws and requirements \nrelated to State and local matching funds, as well laws that limit the \nSecretary's flexibility in designating health professional shortage \nareas.\n  To ensure a comprehensive public health response in the months ahead, \nthis critical legislation facilitates long-term Federal-State \ncooperation and coordination in a public health emergency, and assists \nwith expanding and strengthening the health care safety net by \nincreasing access to and resources for sites at which people displaced \nby Hurricane Katrina can receive primary and preventive care. It \nensures immediate availability of mental health funding in the event of \nmajor disasters by directing special emergency mental health funding to \naffected areas, and directs additional outreach and assistance to \nindividuals with disabilities, including funds to States during an \nemergency to ensure that individuals with disabilities have access to \nadvocacy and support services.\n\n  Additionally, the bill we are introducing today clarifies appropriate \nprotocols for emergency response by requiring additional data \ncollection and analysis for use in this and future responses to major \ndisasters.\n  Finally, my committee has also worked diligently to create a solution \nto another crisis created by Hurricane Katrina. This devastating \nnatural disaster has changed lives and disrupted businesses all across \nthe gulf coast of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. Families and \nemployers are going to need our help getting the basic necessities of \nfood, water, shelter, and clothing while they decide how to move \nforward and rebuild their lives and livelihoods.\n  Hundreds of thousands of the gulf coast evacuees have health \ninsurance that they purchased on their own or that their employer \nprovided and funded. Many of these people are now without a job, and \nmany of these businesses are hanging on as they clean up and wait for \ntheir customers to return to the region. Some people have lost almost \neverything they owned, and now\n\n[[Page S10431]]\n\nthey are in danger of losing their health insurance if they can't pay \ntheir premiums.\n  Congress can and will help them. The bill we are introducing will \nprovide short-term premium relief to people displaced by Hurricane \nKatrina so they can keep their private health insurance.\n  Under this bill, the Department of Health and Human Services, in \nconsultation with State insurance commissioners, will administer a \nprogram to provide 3 months of health insurance premium relief to \nindividuals who have purchased their own policies, and to small \nbusinesses and their employees. Such individuals and businesses will be \neligible if, as of the date of the hurricane, they held health \ninsurance in counties federally designated major disaster areas and \ntheir ability to pay premiums has been severely disrupted. Enrollment \nin the program will occur automatically upon either nonpayment of \npremiums or if communication to an insurer or policyholder indicates \ndistress.\n  To facilitate swift enrollment, there is no prospective application \nprocess. However, the program does provide for a retrospective \nrandomized audit process, whereby HHS may retroactively seek collection \nof premium assistance if such assistance was made in error.\n  To complete this short-term protection for those individuals and \nbusinesses affected by Hurricane Katrina, the bill will prohibit \ninsurers from canceling policies or raising rates during the 3-month \nemergency period.\n  The Public Health and Health Insurance Emergency Response Act of 2005 \nwill provide immediate health insurance premium relief for individuals \nand businesses affected by Hurricane Katrina, and provide the Federal \nGovernment the authority it needs to respond effectively to the public \nhealth needs of people displaced by this terrible disaster.\n  After we pass this bill, our work in response to Hurricane Katrina is \nnot over. This is our emergency response. In the upcoming months, \nworking with Senator Burr, the chairman of our Subcommittee on \nBioterrorism and Public Health Preparedness, and my other committee \ncolleagues, I want to examine fully our preparedness and response \ncapabilities as they relate to public health, mental health, and health \ncare. I also want to focus on how best to rebuild the critical health \ncare and public health infrastructure that was destroyed as a result of \nHurricane Katrina.\n  These are some of the long-term challenges we must tackle. But in the \nshort term, we must address the immediate needs and emergent challenges \nimposed by Hurricane Katrina. I urge my colleagues to join me as \nsponsors of the Public Health and Health Insurance Emergency Response \nAct of 2005, and I look forward to seeing the Senate pass this bill in \nthe very near future.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1769\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

EMERGENCY DESIGNATION.\n\n       Any amount provided under this Act is designated as an \n     emergency requirement pursuant to section 402 of H. Con. Res. \n     95 (109th Congress).\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today, I join Senator Enzi in introducing \na relief bill that will bring aid to hundreds of thousands of people \naffected by Hurricane Katrina. I commend Chairman Enzi and our \ncolleagues on the Committee for moving so quickly to meet the many \nurgent health needs of the victims.\n  We have all seen the images of despair of those who felt so abandoned \nby their government in their time of need. We have also seen hope \nreborn in the faces of families reunited after surviving this massive \ncatastrophe. We have seen great heroism too, not only in the \nspectacular images of rescues by helicopter, but in the quiet courage \nof neighbors helping neighbors survive the heavy winds and rising \nwaters.\n  It's been three weeks since Hurricane Katrina brought havoc to the \nGulf Coast. Every day, we have a clearer picture of physical \ndestruction of beloved American communities, and a deeper understanding \nof what our fellow citizens have lost. Survivors have begun the slow \nand difficult process of rebuilding their lives. Most have , only the \nclothing they wore as they tried to cope with the hurricane.\n  Another picture is also emerging--a report card filled with failing \ngrades for government at every level in the preparations and response \nfor such an emergency. The natural disaster was compounded many fold by \nthe inadequate response, despite the bravery and sacrifice of relief \nworkers, rescue personnel, and the hurricane survivors themselves.\n  With new destruction in Texas and Louisiana from Hurricane Rita, we \nhad little time to learn from these past lessons. Already, we responded \nsooner by insisting on the evacuation of people in flood-prone areas \nand shipping food and supplies quickly into the hard hit areas. \nUnfortunately, this means that many Hurricane Katrina evacuees had to \nrelocate again. They halted their individual rebuilding processes, and \nonce again, now find themselves in unfamiliar surroundings dealing with \nanguish, fear, loss, and uncertainty.\n  The recent evacuations reveal additional lessons to be learned. \nMassive gridlock on evacuation routes, gasoline shortages, and \noverwhelmed airports are just the beginning of many challenges that lie \nahead. We need to learn faster and learn better, so that we can prepare \nmore effectively before disasters happen, react more effectively as \nthey take place, and respond more effectively in the aftermath.\n  I commend Chairman Enzi for convening two roundtable discussions that \nprovided impressive expertise about what can be done immediately to \nprotect the health of those affected by the hurricane and help them \nbegin to rebuild their lives.\n\n[[Page S10435]]\n\n  Our committee listened carefully and prepared a relief package to \naddress the immediate health needs of the survivors for the next 90 \ndays. We have a long road ahead of us, but this bill is an important \nstart. As the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita continues to \nunfold, we will learn of additional needs, and be reminded again and \nagain that we have much more to do to improve the nation's ability to \nrespond to disasters, whether man-made or natural.\n  In this legislation, we are focusing on what we can do to immediately \nremove the perennial red tape and make sure that each and every \nsurvivor has access to good health care. For those with health \ninsurance, the bill provides temporary assistance on premiums, so that \nindividuals and small businesses affected by the hurricanes maintain \ntheir existing coverage. I'm hopeful we can work together to extend \nsimilar help to persons in larger firms who need temporary assistance.\n  We also authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \nextend insurance deadlines, so that hurricane survivors have time to \nmake important decisions about their coverage.\n  In preventing disease outbreaks and epidemics, time is of the \nessence. The bill removes barriers to existing public health programs, \nsuch as by allowing the Vaccines for Children Program to contribute to \nthe vaccination campaign already under way, in order to prevent \noutbreaks of disease in responders and in persons relying on the same \nshelter.\n  It is especially urgent to monitor the survivors and responders, in \norder to identify both the short-term and the long-term risks they \nface. I will continue to work with my colleagues to authorize the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services to work closely with other \nagencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency, to begin \nmonitoring health outcomes and exposure to environmental toxins, and to \ndevelop a registry of people screened, so that we can identify long-\nterm consequences.\n  As we focus on preventing and treating physical illness, we must not \nignore the emotional challenges ahead for both survivors and \nresponders. Thousands are facing the silent battle of coping with \nbereavement and catastrophe. All are at risk for post-traumatic stress \ndisorder. Today, we are reauthorizing the emergency mental health \nservices program of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services \nAdministration's and giving priority to awarding its grants to states \nand areas most affected by the hurricanes.\n  This measure is only the beginning. It ends restrictions on existing \nFederal programs, so that we can help immediately with the relief \nefforts and expand access to health care for the survivors.\n  I'm encouraged by how well our colleagues have worked together to \nrapidly develop this relief package, and I urge the Majority Leader and \nthe full Senate to make passing this legislation a priority and bring \nhelp to the thousands affected by the hurricane.\n  I'm also optimistic that our bipartisan cooperation here will lead to \nfurther relief measures that fully address the longer term health needs \nof the victims, and prevent the kind of mistakes that happened in \nconnection with Katrina and Rita from happening again.\n  Congress has a major responsibility to help the survivors of this \ntragic ordeal rebuild their communities and their lives. Today, we make \na clear commitment to the survivors. Our promise to them should not \nsimply be to turn back the clock a month or two--it should be to \nfulfill the true promise of the American Dream by committing ourselves \nto better health, better education and better job opportunities for \nsurvivors, and for all Americans as well.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. OBAMA (for himself, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Kerry, \n        and Mr. Levin):\n  S. 1770. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor advance payment of the earned income tax credit and the child tax \ncredit for 2005 in order to provide needed funds to victims of \nHurricane Katrina and to stimulate local economies; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the \n``Hurricane Katrina Fast-Track Refunds for Working Families Act of \n2005,'' a bill I am introducing with Senators Murray, Corzine, Kerry, \nand Levin to accelerate the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Child Tax \nCredit for some of the neediest victims of Hurricane Katrina.\n  A few weeks ago, I visited some of the victims who had been evacuated \nto the Reliant Center in Houston. These families have nothing left. \nImagine having nothing left. All their belongings have been destroyed \nor washed away and most of their jobs have simply vanished.\n  We have done a lot of good work here in the Senate so far to bring \ntax relief and emergency support to these families. And many of us are \nhard at work now developing strategies for the long-term rebuilding of \nthe Gulf Coast in such a way that doesn't re-create the poverty and \ninequality of the past but instead builds a more hopeful region with \ngreater opportunity for all of its residents.\n  But there is more we can do quickly to help affected families \nreestablish and resettle their lives and also to stimulate their local \neconomies. In the past we have accelerated tax refunds with the goal of \neconomic stimulus. In 2001, Congress directed the IRS to provide an \n``advance tax rebate'' of 2001 taxes, and, in 2003, Congress \naccelerated the Child Credit. Now, with the dual goals of economic \nstimulus and support for needy Americans, we should do it again.\n  Fast-tracking refunds will put money into the hands of parents that \nthey can use for food, clothing, housing, transportation, medical \nservices--whatever they need. How they spend the money is up to them. \nBut it's up to us to make sure they get it as soon as possible. It's up \nto us to make sure the necessary outreach, systems, and delivery \nmechanisms are in place.\n  And that's what this legislation does. It directs the Secretary of \nthe Treasury to refund or credit eligible taxpayers from the affected \nregion as rapidly as possible and to take the steps necessary to get \nthe funds into the hands of eligible recipients. Companion legislation \nhas been introduced by Reps. Emanuel, Melancon, Taylor, and Lewis in \nthe House of Representatives.\n  I urge my colleagues in the Senate to join me in supporting this bill \nnow so we can quickly bring relief and support to those who have \nnothing left. The Earned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit are \ndesigned to support working families with children. Let's fast track \nthis support to help these families get back on their feet and help \ntheir communities rebuild themselves even stronger than before.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ENZI (for himself and Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 1771. A bill to express the sense of Congress and to improve \nreporting with respect to the safety of workers in the response and \nrecovery activities related to Hurricane Katrina, and for other \npurposes; read the first time.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce The Katrina Worker \nSafety and Filing Flexibility Act of 2005.\n  In the wake of Hurricane Katrina we face a nearly unprecedented \nrecovery and reconstruction process along our Gulf Coast. This is a \nchallenge that we will meet. We are a people that always act with \nstrength and purposefulness when circumstances such as this demand.\n  While we undertake this massive effort, we must bear in mind the \nsafety of the men and women who will be on the front lines of recovery \nand reconstruction. These individuals will face numerous and uncommon \nworksite hazards; and ones with which they will have little training \nand experience.\n  To address this situation, the Occupational Safety and Health \nAdministration has deployed its safety and health professionals to the \naffected areas to provide necessary technical assistance. Their efforts \nin this regard are being guided by the Worker Health and Safety Annex \ncontained in the National Response Plan as adopted by the Department of \nHomeland Security.\n  I am pleased today to be introducing this legislation with my \ndistinguished colleague and ranking member of the Committee, Senator \nKennedy. He and I share a commitment to protecting the health and \nsafety of all workers, including those engaged in the hurricane \nrecovery effort.\n\n[[Page S10436]]\n\n  The legislation we are introducing today not only encourages the \nimplementation of all aspects of the Worker Safety Annex, it encourages \nOSHA to play a central role in communicating the nature of these unique \nworksite hazards, and in cooperating with State, local and tribal \ngovernments, as well as other Federal agencies to enhance the safety of \nrecovery and reconstruction personnel. In addition, the legislation \ngrants the Secretary of Labor authority to extend the deadline for \nfiling certain forms with the Department until March of 2006 in light \nof the difficulties in meeting any earlier deadlines as a result of the \nhurricane.\n  We believe the bill is an important step in providing the necessary \nprotection to recovery and reconstruction workers; and providing the \nnecessary degree of flexibility with regard to required Federal \nfilings.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today Senator Enzi and I are introducing \nlegislation to protect the workers who are laboring to clean up the \nGulf Coast after its recent disasters.\n  The heroism of America's workers in the wake of Hurricane Katrina is \nunparalleled. As they did in response to our national disaster on \nSeptember 11, thousands of men and women have been working around the \nclock to find and rescue families, to provide them with food and \nshelter, and to evacuate them from the area. In the coming days \nthousands more will be on the ground reestablishing communications, \ncleaning up debris, restoring services, and rebuilding infrastructure. \nThey are now facing additional challenges because of the new damage and \nflooding from Hurricane Rita, but they continue to make progress in \ncleaning and rebuilding New Orleans and the entire disaster area.\n  This work is critical, but it is also dangerous. Many of these tasks \npose significant safety and health threats: conditions in New Orleans \nare of particular concern, where the widespread flooding has led to \nwidespread biological and chemical contamination. We learn more each \nday about the oil spills, the Superfund sites, and exposure to E. coli \nthat these workers are facing. It is imperative that workers and \nvolunteers be protected from these serious hazards.\n  That is why our legislation includes language to protect the health \nand safety of workers. It urges OSHA and other health and safety \nagencies to follow the Worker Health and Safety Annex protections of \nour National Response Plan. This includes keeping track of workers who \nare being exposed, coordinating health and safety training for workers \nand volunteers, and monitoring the hazards that workers and volunteers \nare facing. It also authorizes funds to be spent for additional \npersonnel, enforcement of health and safety standards, critical safety \ninformation for workers and employers, and safety and health training. \nI hope that as Congress continues to allocate money for disaster relief \nthat we also provide money to protect our workers and volunteers.\n  We need to track how our efforts are working, and so we have provided \nfor Congressional oversight. OSHA will be required to brief the HELP \nCommittee in six months, and provide a written report within nine \nmonths, so we can see what progress has been made and what still needs \nto be done. We have also mandated oversight by the Executive Branch. \nThe Inspector General of the Department of Labor will audit and \ninvestigate the Department's efforts to implement the protections \nestablished in this bill, and will report back to both Houses of \nCongress on the success of these response and recovery efforts.\n  Finally, the bill also provides temporary relief to many companies, \nunions and individuals who are required to meet financial and other \nreporting obligations during the next few months, but cannot satisfy \nthese obligations due to record destruction and other problems \nassociated with Katrina.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INHOFE (for himself, Mr. DeMint, Ms. Murkowski, Mr. \n        Voinovich, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Thune, and Mr. Bond):\n  S. 1772. A bill to streamline the refinery permitting process, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, by design, politicians are largely a \nreactive bunch--our constituents voted us in to our offices to \nrepresent their interests, and when they are unhappy we too are \nunhappy. One issue that certainly makes all constituents unhappy or \neven angry is high fuel prices. Therefore, policymakers at all levels \nof government have been struggling with ways to address high prices--\nsome have advocated for repealing fuel taxes, the Administration \nreacted in many critically important and helpful ways such as releasing \noil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. After Hurricane Katrina \ndisabled a large portion of our refining capacity and Rita threatened \nan additional 27.5 percent, several members have talked about the need \nto build new refineries.\n  In May 2004--Before the hurricanes, and before EPACT 2005 (The Energy \nPolicy Act of 2005), the Environment & Public Works Committee, which I \nchair, considered the challenges facing the refining industry. At that \nhearing, we learned how the industry has been struggling to balance the \npublic's increasing demand for cheap transportation fuels while also \nmeeting legal and regulatory requirements to produce cleaner fuels.\n  Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan stated in a May 2005 speech \nthat, ``the status of world refining capacity has become worrisome. Of \nspecial concern is the need to add adequate coking and desulphurization \ncapacity to convert the average gravity and sulphur content of much of \nthe world's crude oil to the lighter and sweeter needs of product \nmarkets, which are increasingly dominated by transportation fuels that \nmust meet ever-more stringent environmental requirements.''\n  Make no mistake, significant investments have been made to achieving \nenvironmental objectives--however, investments into increasing capacity \nhave been inadequate to meet demand, and no new domestic refinery has \nbeen built since 1976.\n  A critical hurdle to constructing anything these days, especially \nrefineries, is overcoming the ``Not-In-My-Backyard'' or NIMBY \ninterests. The President recognized the need to build new refineries \nwhile overcoming local opposition when he recommended that policymakers \nconsider constructing on BRAC sites.\n  Building upon what we learned in our hearing while balancing \npotential local opposition to refineries and answering the President \nand the public's call, I rise today to introduce the Gas Petroleum \nRefiner Improvement and Community Empowerment Act or Gas PRICE Act. \nThis Gas PRICE Act seeks to address fuels challenges in the short, mid \nand long-term range in several key ways.\n  First, the bill encourages communities who are about to lose jobs as \na result of BRAC to consider building refineries on those properties. \nThe legislation directs the Economic Development Administration to \nprovide additional resources to communities considering new refineries \non those sites. Refineries are not just a good source of high paying \njobs, but they are an area of national interest so those communities \nacting in that interest should be benefited.\n  Second, States have a significant if not dominant role in permitting \nexisting or new refineries. Yet, States face particular technical and \nfinancial constraints when faced with these extremely complex \nfacilities. Therefore, the Gas PRICE Act establishes a Governor opt-in \nprogram that requires the Administrator to coordinate and concurrently \nreview all permits with the relevant State agencies to permit \nrefineries. This program does not waive or modify any environmental \nlaw, but seeks to assist States and consumers by providing greater \ncertainty in the permitting process.\n  Third, the Gas PRICE Act answers the call for increasing efficiency. \nToday's recent reports show that natural gas prices this winter are \nprojected to increase 75 percent. This bill requires the EPA's Natural \nGas Star Program to provide grants to identify and use methane emission \nreduction technologies.\n  Further, it requires the Administrator to conduct a series of methane \nemission reduction workshops with the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact \nCommission to officials in the oil and gas producing states.\n  Fourth, the supply disruptions caused by hurricane Katrina required\n\n[[Page S10437]]\n\nEPA to issue fuel waivers to allow the use of conventional fuel in \nspecial or boutique fuel areas. The bill provides that States acting \npursuant to an emergency will be held harmless under the law. \nAdditionally, some members have called for the reduction of the total \nnumber of fuels used to increase the overall fungibility. In principle, \nI agree with my colleagues, however the special or boutique fuel blends \naddress environmental and health needs of each region. Therefore, I \nhave proposed a more cautious approach that will allow for the \nreduction of fuel blends pursuant to the environmental and consumer \npreferences in each State.\n  Fifth, policymakers, businesses, and the public have struggled to \nbalance increased demand for transportation fuels against preferences \nfor ever more stringent environmental quality all while preserving low \nprices at the pump. Most ``solutions'' have focused on technologies \nthat may not be realized for decades or other measures that would hurt \nU.S. manufacturers.\n  Fischer-Tropsche fuels are the likely answer. F-T fuels use petroleum \ncoke, a waste product from the refining process, or domestic coal to \nproduce ultra-clean, virtually sulfur free diesel or jet fuel, and are \nprice competitive at $38/barrel of oil.\n  The Gas PRICE Act requires EPA to establish a demonstration project \nto use Fischer-Tropsche, diesel and jet, as an emission control \nstrategy; and authorizes EPA to issue up to two loan guarantees to \ndemonstrate commercial scale F--T fuels production facilities using \ndomestic petroleum coke or coal.\n  Of course, Congress should have taken many actions in anticipation of \nthe current refining capacity crunch over last several years. Yet, as I \nindicated earlier, elected officials in large measure react to the will \nof their constituents. The good news is that we are not too late to \nmake sure that the economy-wide stifling high prices are only \ntemporary.\n  The Gas PRICE Act that we are introducing today can go a long way in \naddressing the nation's short, mid, and long-term fuels challenges. \nFurthermore, it does so by empowering local communities and States, \nestablishing greater regulatory certainty without changing any \nenvironmental law, improving efficiency, and establishing a future for \nthe use of ultra clean transportation fuels derived from abundant \ndomestic resources.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 1773. A bill to resolve certain Native American claims in New \nMexico, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague, Senator \nBingaman, to introduce a historic piece of legislation. I call this \nbill historic because its purpose is to implement the final settlement \nto be entered into under the Indian Claims Commission Act of 1946. I \nunderstand that passage of this legislation will complete the final \nchapter in the history of that act.\n  The Indian Claims Commission Act of 1946 was enacted to allow the \nIndian Claims Commission to hear certain tribal claims filed between \n1946 and 1951. Nationally, the act has involved more than 600 claims by \ntribes. With the passage of this legislation, we will complete the \nprocess begun in almost sixty years ago.\n  The specific claim being resolved by the Pueblo de San Ildefonso \nClaims Settlement Act of 2005 involves the San Ildefonso Pueblo's \n7,700-acre ancestral land claim against the Federal Government. This \nbill marks the successful culmination of a long-awaited settlement \nagreement between the San Ildefonso Pueblo and the United States and \ninvolved much hard work by all of the parties involved. The \nintroduction of this legislation marks an important day for the San \nIldefonso Pueblo and others in my home state of New Mexico. This is a \nnecessary bill, and I hope that my colleagues will act quickly to \nresolve the final claim filed under the Indian Claims Commission Act of \n1946.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1773\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Domenici in \nintroducing the Pueblo de San Ildefonso Claims Settlement Act. This \nclaim, the last one pending before the Indian Claims Commission, has \ngone unresolved for over 50 years and it is certainly long past time to \nbring an end to this dispute. I'd particularly like to commend the \nPueblo de San Ildefonso for their diligent work on this settlement. It \nis testament to the Pueblo's fortitude and open-minded approach to this \nissue that they have been able find consensus with the many parties to \nthis settlement and produce this compromise legislation.\n  As with any settlement of a lawsuit, it's unlikely that everyone will \nbe completely happy with the terms of the deal but I am pleased to note \nthat all of the local governments, tribal and municipal, have expressed \ntheir support. I hope that the introduction of this bill begins a \nproductive process in the Indian Affairs Committee and, once the final \nproduct is signed into law, with the public that will definitively \nsettle the issues of land ownership in this area and allow all of the \nlocal communities to move forward cooperatively.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/26/senate-section/article/S10440-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10440]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 251--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT THE \nPRESIDENT SHOULD ENSURE THAT FEDERAL RESPONSE AND RECOVERY EFFORTS FOR \n   HURRICANE KATRINA INCLUDE CONSIDERATION FOR ANIMAL RESCUE AND CARE\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN (for himself, Mr. Santorum, and Mr. Levin) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Sense of the Senate.--(a) Findings.--The Senate \n     finds the following:\n       (1) In a time of national catastrophe, it is the \n     responsibility of Congress and the Executive Branch to take \n     quick and decisive action to help those in need.\n       (2) The size, scope, and complexity of Hurricane Katrina \n     are unprecedented, and the emergency response and long-term \n     recovery efforts will be extensive and require significant \n     resources.\n       (3) It is the responsibility of Congress and the Executive \n     Branch to ensure the financial stability of the nation by \n     being good stewards of Americans' hard-earned tax dollars.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that any funding directive contained in this Act, or its \n     accompanying report, that is not specifically authorized in \n     any Federal law as of the date of enactment of this section, \n     or Act or resolution passed by the Senate during the 1st \n     Session of the 109th Congress prior to such date, or proposed \n     in pursuance to an estimate submitted in accordance with law, \n     that is for the benefit of an identifiable program, project, \n     activity, entity, or jurisdiction and is not directly related \n     to the impact of Hurricane Katrina, may be redirected to \n     recovery efforts if the appropriate head of an agency or \n     department determines, after consultation with appropriate \n     Congressional Committees, that the funding directive is not \n     of national significance or is not in the public interest.\n       Sec. 798. (a) The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) Research and development have been critical components \n     of the prosperity of the United States.\n       (2) The United States is entering an increasingly \n     competitive world in the 21st century.\n       (3) The National Academy of Sciences has found that public \n     agricultural research and development expenditures in the \n     United States were the lowest of any developed country in the \n     world.\n       (4) The Nation needs to ensure that public spending for \n     agricultural research is commensurate with the importance of \n     agriculture to the long-term economic health of the Nation.\n       (5) Research and development is critical to ensuring that \n     American agriculture remains strong and vital in the coming \n     decades.\n       (b) It is the sense of the Senate that, in order for the \n     United States to remain competitive, the President and the \n     Department of Agriculture should increase public sector \n     funding of agricultural research and development.\n       Sec. 799. It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the Senate--\n       (A) encourages expanded efforts to alleviate hunger \n     throughout developing countries; and\n       (B) pledges to continue to support international hunger \n     relief efforts;\n       (2) the United States Government should use financial and \n     diplomatic resources to work with other donors to ensure that \n     food aid programs receive all necessary funding and supplies; \n     and\n       (3) food aid should be provided in conjunction with \n     measures to alleviate hunger, malnutrition, and poverty.\n       Sec. 800. Amounts made available for the Plant Materials \n     Center in Fallon, Nevada, under the heading ``conservation \n     operations'' under the heading ``natural resources \n     conservation service'' of title II of the Agriculture, Rural \n     Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related \n     Agencies Appropriations Act, 2005 (Public Law 108-447; 118 \n     Stat. 2823) shall remain available until expended.\n       Sec. 801. Not later than 90 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Agriculture, in \n     cooperation with the Secretary of Energy, shall provide to \n     the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate and the \n     Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives a \n     report that describes the impact of increased prices of gas, \n     natural gas, and diesel on agricultural producers, ranchers, \n     and rural communities.\n       Sec. 802. The Secretary of Agriculture (referred to in this \n     section as the ``Secretary'') shall prepare a report for \n     submission by the President to Congress, along with the \n     fiscal year 2007 budget request under section 1105 of title \n     31, United States Code, that--\n       (1) identifies measures to address bark beetle infestation \n     and the impacts of bark beetle infestation as the first \n     priority for assistance under the Healthy Forests Restoration \n     Act of 2003 (16 U.S.C. 6501 et seq.);\n       (2) describes activities that will be conducted by the \n     Secretary to address bark beetle infestations and the impacts \n     of bark beetle infestations;\n       (3) describes the financial and technical resources that \n     will be dedicated by the Secretary to measures to address \n     bark beetle infestations and the impacts of the infestations; \n     and\n       (4) describes the manner in which the Secretary will \n     coordinate with the Secretary of the Interior and State and \n     local governments in conducting the activities under \n     paragraph (2).\n       Sec. 803. Any limitation, directive, or earmarking \n     contained in either the House of Representatives or Senate \n     report accompanying H.R. 2744 shall also be included in the \n     conference report or joint statement accompanying H.R. 2744 \n     in order to be considered as having been approved by both \n     Houses of Congress.\n       Sec. 804. (a) Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Consumers need clear and consistent information about \n     the risks associated with exposure to the sun, and the \n     protection offered by over-the-counter sunscreen products.\n       (2) The Food and Drug Administration (referred to in this \n     section as the ``FDA'') began developing a monograph for \n     over-the-counter sunscreen products in 1978.\n       (3) In 2002, after 23 years, the FDA issued the final \n     monograph for such sunscreen products.\n       (4) One of the most critical aspects of sunscreen is how to \n     measure protection against UVA rays, which cause skin cancer.\n       (5) The final sunscreen monograph failed to address this \n     critical aspect and, accordingly, the monograph was stayed \n     shortly after being issued until issuance of a comprehensive \n     monograph.\n       (6) Skin cancer rates continue to rise, especially in \n     younger adults and women.\n       (7) Pursuant to section 751 of the Federal Food, Drug, and \n     Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 379r), a Federal rule on sunscreen \n     labeling would preempt any related State labeling \n     requirements.\n       (8) The absence of a Federal rule could lead to a patchwork \n     of State labeling requirements that would be confusing to \n     consumers and unnecessarily burdensome to manufacturers.\n       (b) It is the sense of Congress that the FDA should, not \n     later than one year after the date of enactment of this Act, \n     issue a comprehensive final monograph for over-the-counter \n     sunscreen products, including UVA and UVB labeling \n     requirements, in order to provide consumers with all the \n     necessary information regarding the dangers of skin cancer \n     and the importance of wearing sunscreen.\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Agriculture, Rural \n     Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related \n     Agencies Appropriations Act, 2006''.\n\n

Tomorrow we will resume statements on the nomination of \nJohn Roberts, those statements having begun at about 1 o'clock today. \nMoments ago we locked in a time certain for the vote on the \nconfirmation of the Roberts nomination, and that vote is now set for \nThursday morning at 11:30 a.m. I do ask all Senators to be in the \nChamber and seated at their desks on this historic day for this \nhistoric vote.\n  Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday morning will be devoted to continued \nstatements on Judge Roberts. Now that the final vote is set, I \nencourage Members to come over early for their statements rather than \nwaiting until Thursday morning.\n  In talking to the Democratic leader, in all likelihood, as we look to \nlater this week, we will be voting on Friday. I make that statement \nrecognizing that we are going to complete this Thursday morning, and we \nplan on going directly to the Department of Defense appropriations \nbill. Over the course of this session, we have not voted on a lot of \nFridays, but now we are going to have to begin voting on Fridays. I \nwish to give people notification on both sides of the aisle given the \nfact that we have so much business going on and, in such a short period \nof time, so much to do. We will give Members as much advance notice as \npossible, but I do want to notify people that we will be voting on this \nFriday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/26/senate-section/article/S10460-7", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10460]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:45 A.M.
