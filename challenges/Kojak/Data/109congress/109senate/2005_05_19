Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session for the consideration of calendar No. 71, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Priscilla Richman Owen, \nof Texas, to be United States Circuit Judge for the Fifth Circuit.\n\n\n                   Recognition Of The Majority Leader\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                                Schedule\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, today we will resume executive session to \nconsider Priscilla Owen to be a U.S. circuit court judge for the Fifth \nCircuit. We will continue the debate, as we did yesterday, by rotating \nback and forth between the aisle every 60 minutes. I think this orderly \nflow of debate will be helpful in terms of scheduling Members' speaking \ntimes. It worked well yesterday, and I would expect it to be orderly \ntoday as well. I know there is a large number of Senators who have \nindicated their desire to speak, and we will remain on the nomination \nto give everyone a chance to fully voice their concerns and their \ndiscussion on this very qualified nominee.\n  I am hopeful that at some point we will be able to schedule a vote on \nthe nomination, and I will update Members later today on the upcoming \nschedule as it relates to the nomination of Priscilla Owen.\n  Mr. President, I will have a brief statement--the Democratic leader \nand I were just discussing our plans--and then he will have a \nstatement, and then at that juncture I believe we will proceed as we \nset out the time schedule yesterday, alternating back and forth.\n  Mr. President, we did, yesterday, have a vibrant and spirited debate \non the Senate floor. We have been debating a very simple principle--one \nbased on fairness and one grounded in the Constitution. The principle \nis that judicial nominees, with the support of a majority of Senators, \ndeserve a fair up-or-down vote on the floor of the Senate.\n  Yesterday, 21 Senators--evenly divided, I believe 11 Republicans and \n10 Democrats--debated for over 10 hours on the nomination of Priscilla \nOwen. We will continue that debate--10 hours yesterday--maybe 20 hours, \nmaybe 30 hours, and we will take as long as it takes for Senators to \nexpress their views on this qualified nominee.\n  But at some point that debate should end and there should be a vote. \nIt makes sense: up or down, ``yes'' or ``no,'' confirm or reject; and \nthen we move on in regular order.\n\n  Senators can vote to confirm or reject a nominee. But we should \nfulfill our constitutional responsibility to give advice and consent by \nvoting up or down.\n  The nominee before us is Priscilla Owen, a Texas Supreme Court \njustice nominated to serve on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. I \nhave studied her record. I have had the opportunity to meet with her \npersonally. I believe she would serve our Nation well as a circuit \ncourt judge.\n  Her academic and professional qualifications are outstanding. She \ngraduated near the top of her class in law school, and she once \nachieved the highest score in the State of Texas on the bar exam. The \nAmerican Bar Association unanimously rated her ``well qualified,'' its \nhighest possible rating.\n  Her opponents suggest she is a judicial activist who is out of the \nmainstream. Her record simply shows that is not true. She was reelected \nby 84 percent of Texans. Are 84 percent of Texans really out of the \nmainstream? She is supported by Republicans and Democrats on the Texas \nSupreme Court. She has been endorsed by every major newspaper in her \nhome State.\n  That is a mainstream record.\n  In her judicial decisions, some on the floor over the last day, and \nactually last week as well, have criticized her as a judicial activist \nin cases, and the focus has always been on these cases involving a \nparental notification law.\n\n[[Page S5454]]\n\nThe law is not about whether a minor is able to have an abortion or \nwhether a minor must receive parental consent before having an \nabortion. The law simply requires a parent to be notified if their \nchild is having an abortion, except in certain circumstances.\n  The author of the law, and 26 other members of the Texas legislature, \nhave defended Justice Owen's opinions, and it is spelled out clearly in \na letter of May 16, 2005, that is signed by the author of the \nlegislation itself and 26 other members of the Texas legislature.\n  The letter is interesting. It is a letter dated May 16, and it is a \nletter that was sent to Senator Specter, of the Judiciary Committee, \nand Senator Leahy. The letter is indeed quite powerful. I would like to \nread just a couple sections from the letter.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following my remarks the \nentire letter be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. FRIST. The letter reads pretty clearly: ``Dear Chairman \nSpecter''--and there was a copy sent to Senator Leahy. This is from the \nauthor of the legislation of which these accusations of judicial \nactivism have been floating around on the floor. These are the authors, \nthe people who wrote--who wrote--the legislation. I quote from the \nletter:\n\n       I, along with my colleagues in the Texas Senate and Texas \n     House of Representatives, am writing to express my full and \n     unconditional support for Justice Priscilla Owen's nomination \n     to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. As the \n     author of the Texas Parental Notification Act, I followed \n     closely the Texas State Supreme Court rulings regarding that \n     statute. As such, we are disturbed by the recent attacks on \n     Justice Owen's review of the Texas Parental Notification Act. \n     Justice Owen's opponents have characterized her as an \n     activist member of the bench, and nothing could be further \n     from the truth.\n\n  The letter continues:\n\n       To the contrary, her opinions interpreting the Texas \n     Parental Notification Act serve as prime examples of her \n     judicial restraint.\n\n  Mr. President, I will have my colleagues read the remainder of the \nletter. It goes on and gives examples in explaining that statement. And \nthen, down in the following paragraph, I quote:\n\n       Throughout the series of cases, Justice Owen's \n     interpretation of legislative intent were based on careful \n     reading of the new statute and the governing U.S. Supreme \n     Court precedent.\n\n  This is the final sentence of the letter:\n\n       In short, Justice Owen's academic and professional \n     qualifications are beyond question. We strongly urge Senators \n     to vote positively on her nomination.\n\n  Again, it is signed by the author, Florence Shapiro, and, again, 26 \nothers from the house of representatives and senate in Texas.\n  In addition, a pro-choice Democratic law professor also has defended \nJustice Owen. This professor, Linda Eads, is a member of the Texas \nSupreme Court Advisory Committee that drafted rules to help judges \ndeciding cases under this law, the parental notification law. She says \nJustice Owen's decisions ``do not demonstrate judicial activism. She \ndid what good appellate judges do every day . . . if this is activism, \nthen any judicial interpretation of a statute's terms is judicial \nactivism.''\n\n  If you look fairly at Justice Owen's record, you will see a well-\nqualified, mainstream judge.\n  But I will say, as we step back and look at the larger debate, some \nSenators may draw different conclusions about Justice Owen, and they \nmay decide she does not deserve confirmation. Indeed, they may decide \nthat none of the President's nominees deserve confirmation. And they, \nas Senators, are entitled to that choice. But they should express that \nchoice, give that advice and consent by a vote, an up-or-down vote, \n``yes'' or ``no,'' confirm or reject. They should not hide behind a \nprocedure that prevents 100 Senators from their responsibility, their \nduty to vote ``yes'' or ``no'' on the nominee, up or down.\n  As everyone knows, I have advocated fair up-or-down votes for \njudicial nominees again and again and again and will continue to do so. \nIn the past, some of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have \nshared this view. Many of them have argued forcefully and eloquently \nfor up-or-down votes on judicial nominees. Let me share some of their \narguments with you.\n  One Senator on the other side of the aisle, in opposition to giving \nup-or-down votes today, said:\n\n       [E]veryone who is nominated ought to have a hearing and to \n     have a shot to be heard on the floor and have a vote on the \n     floor.\n\n  Another Democratic Senator said:\n\n       A nominee is entitled to a vote. Vote them up; vote them \n     down. . . . If there are things in their background, in their \n     abilities that don't pass muster, vote no. Our institutional \n     integrity requires an up-or-down vote.\n\n  Another Democratic Senator noted that:\n\n       According to the U.S. Constitution, the President \n     nominates, and the Senate shall provide advice and consent. \n     It is not the role of the Senate to obstruct the process and \n     prevent numbers of highly qualified nominees from even being \n     given the opportunity for a vote on the Senate floor.\n\n  These are all arguments from my Democratic colleagues in years past. \nThese quotes capture what this debate today is all about. It is about \nfairness. It is about principle. It is about the constitutional duty of \nevery Senator. The Senate must do what is right. We must do what is \nfair. We must do the job the American people elected us to do.\n  So let us continue to debate. Let Senators exercise their right to \nspeak. We may not agree. We will not agree on every judicial nominee, \nbut we can agree on the principle that every qualified judicial nominee \ndeserves an up-or-down vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                               Texas State Senate, District 8,\n\n                                       Plano, Texas, May 16, 2005.\n     Hon. Chairman Arlen Specter,\n     Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Russell Senate \n         Office Bldg., Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Specter: I, along with my colleagues in the \n     Texas Senate and Texas House of Representatives, am writing \n     to express my full and unconditional support for Justice \n     Priscilla Owen's nomination to the U.S. Court of Appeals for \n     the Fifth Circuit. As the author of the Texas Parental \n     Notification Act (SB 30/HB 623), I followed closely the Texas \n     State Supreme Court rulings regarding that statute. As such, \n     we are disturbed by the recent attacks on Justice Owen's \n     review of the Texas Parental Notification Act. Justice Owen's \n     opponents have characterized her as an activist member of the \n     bench, and nothing could be further from the truth.\n       To the contrary, her opinions interpreting the Texas \n     Parental Notification Act serve as prime examples of her \n     judicial restraint. Although some might try to hold up the \n     Texas Parental Notification Act as a litmus test on abortion, \n     they simply cannot make the case. The Act is not about \n     whether a minor is able to have an abortion or must receive \n     parental consent, but whether a parent should be notified. \n     The Act recognizes that a girl may have an abortion and does \n     not question whether the Constitution guarantees that right.\n       Throughout the series of cases, Justice Owen's \n     interpretations of legislative intent were based on careful \n     reading of the new statute and the governing U.S. Supreme \n     Court precedent. For example, Justice Owen's opinion that a \n     minor should ``indicate to the court that she is aware of and \n     has considered that there are philosophic, social, moral, and \n     religious arguments that can be brought to bear when \n     considering abortion.'' This opinion is consistent with prior \n     U.S. Supreme Court precedent stating: ``The waiting period, \n     for example, may provide the parent or parents of a pregnant \n     young woman the opportunity to consult with her in private, \n     and to discuss the consequences of her decision in the \n     context of the values and moral or religious principles of \n     their family'' (Planned Parenthood v. Casey).\n       In short, Justice Owen's academic and professional \n     qualifications are beyond question. We strongly urge Senators \n     to vote positively on her nomination.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                            Sen. Florence Shapiro,\n                                            President Pro Tempore.\n\n         Sen. Chris Harris; Sen. Jane Nelson; Rep. Brian McCall; \n           Rep. Harvey Hilderbran; Rep.

It is my understanding that we go to the debate on Judge \nOwen at what time?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. We are on debate now.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the time of the two leaders \nnot\n\n[[Page S5455]]\n\ntake away from the debate that will begin at 9:45. What I am saying is, \nwhatever time we use, the debate should start immediately after our \ntime, the incremental time.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The leader time is reserved. The Senator \nis entitled to take it. The controlled time does not begin until 10 \na.m.\n  Mr. REID. I realize that. I would like to reserve my time and use \nthis time to speak on the matter now before the Senate.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time between now and 10 a.m. is not \ncontrolled.\n  Mr. REID. Just so I understand, it was my understanding the debate on \nPriscilla Owen was supposed to start at quarter to 10.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. It is to start at 10 o'clock.\n  Mr. REID. I misunderstood. I apologize, Mr. President.\n  (Mr. Vitter assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have addressed the Senate on several \noccasions to do what I believe is setting the record straight about \nSenate history and the rules of this body. But, frankly, I would much \nrather address wage and health care costs, bringing down gas prices, \ntalk about education, spiraling deficits we have. But the majority \nleader has decided we will spend this week and next week, or at least \npart of next week, talking about judges who I believe, Mr. President, \nare not in the mainstream of American jurisprudence.\n  I am happy to engage in this debate. I would rather not. But I do \nwant the debate to be accurate. For example, my good friend, the \ndistinguished Republican leader, issued a statement last Friday in \nwhich he called the filibuster a ``procedural gimmick.'' I took time \nyesterday to correct that assertion, setting forth in the Record what \nthe word ``gimmick'' means. The dictionary defines it as a scheme, a \nnew scheme. I indicated that certainly the filibuster was everything \nbut that. It is not a gimmick. It has been part of the Nation's history \nfor two centuries. It is one of the vital checks and balances \nestablished by our visionary Founding Fathers. It is not a gimmick.\n  Also, some Republicans have stated improperly the use of the \nfilibuster. They have said time and time again that the defeat of a \nhandful of President Bush's judicial nominees is unprecedented. In \nfact, hundreds of judicial nominees in American history have been \nrejected by the Senate, many by filibuster.\n  There was, of course, the most notable, the nomination of Abe Fortas, \nto be Chief Justice of the United States. He was successfully \nfilibustered in 1968. Here, Mr. President, is a Washington Post which I \nread in the morning when I come in. It is from many years ago. The \nfirst sentence:\n\n       A full-dress Republican-led filibuster broke out in the \n     Senate yesterday against a motion to call up the nomination \n     of Justice Abe Fortas for Chief Justice of the United States.\n\n  ``A full-dress Republican-led filibuster.'' We have had filibusters. \nThat is what has been disappointing to me with some of my colleagues in \nsaying there has not been a filibuster. There has been. During the \nClinton administration, more than 60 judicial nominees were bottled up \nin the Judiciary Committee and never received floor votes. Of course, \nas indicated by my distinguished friend, the Republican leader, during \nthat period of time Democrats were complaining about what was going on, \nsaying there should have been hearings in the Senate, and even came to \nthe floor--and these were accurate quotes of the majority leader--\nsaying: Let's have some votes, let's have some votes on these people.\n  Well, Mr. President, we never said we would break the rules to change \nthe rules. To change the rules in the Senate can't be done by a simple \nmajority. It can only be done if there is extended debate by 67 votes. \nSo I do not at all say that the statements made by the Republican \nleader were wrong about our wanting votes and we were disturbed that \nthere are no votes, but we never, ever suggested that rules should be \nbroken.\n  But in addition to the pocket filibusters--call them whatever you \nwant--the 60, I think 69 nominations never made it out of the Russell \nBuilding, out of the Judiciary Committee, but in addition to those \nperformances, Republicans engaged in explicit filibusters on the floor \nagainst a number of Clinton judges when they did get out of committee, \nand they defeated a number of President Clinton's executive branch \nnominees by filibuster.\n  It is the same advice and consent clause. Why, if a filibuster of \nSurgeon General Henry Foster was constitutional, is a Democratic \nfilibuster of Fifth Circuit Court nominee Priscilla Owen \nunconstitutional? If Foster is constitutional, why wouldn't the same \napply to Priscilla Owen? The Republican argument doesn't add up.\n\n  But I would say this to my friend, the Presiding Officer. I have said \nlet's not dwell on what went on in the Clinton administration. Let's \nnot dwell on what went on in the 4 years of President Bush's \nadministration. I am sure there is plenty of blame to go around. As we \nlook back, I am not sure--and it is difficult to say this, but I say \nit--I am not sure either was handled properly. I have known it wasn't \nright to simply bury 69 nominations, and in hindsight maybe we could \nhave done these 10 a little differently. But the American people are \ntired of what we are doing, tired of the constant fighting going on. \nWhat is going to take place if this continues?\n  We will have a vote sometime next week. It will be a close vote, of \ncourse, We only need six Republicans. The Presiding Officer was \nformerly chairman of the powerful Appropriations Committee. It is very \ndifficult at best to get appropriations bills passed. Most everything \naround here is done by unanimous consent. Things won't work as well as \nthey could have. We need to avoid this. We are all legislators.\n  But, sadly, now the President of the United States has joined the \nfray and become the latest to rewrite the Constitution and reinvent \nreality. Speaking to fellow Republicans on Tuesday night, 2 days ago, \nhe said the Senate ``has a duty to promptly consider each . . . nominee \non the Senate floor, discuss and debate their qualifications and then \ngive them the up-or-down vote they deserve.'' Every one of the 10 he \nspeaks of had votes, every one of them. Right here on the Senate floor, \npeople walked down to these tables and their name was called and they \nvoted.\n  Referring to the President's words, duty to whom? The radical right \nwho see within their reach the destruction of America's mainstream \nvalues. Certainly not duty to the tenets of our Constitution or to the \nAmerican people who are waiting for progress and promise, not \npartisanship and petty debates.\n  The duties of the Senate are set forth in the U.S. Constitution. \nNowhere in that document does it say the Senate has a duty to give \nPresidential appointees a vote. It says appointments shall be made with \nthe advice and consent of the Senate. That is very different than \nsaying every nominee receives a vote. I repeat, all of these about \nwhich we are concerned, including Priscilla Owen, have had a vote, \nright here. The fact was even acknowledged by the majority leader that \na vote is not required. Senator Byrd asked the majority leader--Senator \nByrd was here, the majority leader was here--last week, he asked the \nmajority leader if the Constitution accorded each nominee an up-or-down \nvote on the Senate floor. The answer was no. Senator Frist was candid. \nThe answer was no. The language was not there, Senator Frist said. He \nis correct. Senators should read the same copy of the Constitution \nSenator Frist had memorized.\n  It is clear that the President misunderstands the meaning of the \nadvice and consent clause. The word ``advice'' means advice. President \nClinton consulted extensively with then Judiciary Chairman Hatch, and \nas a result of that we debated Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer to the \nSupreme Court, both fine minds, fine justices. In contrast, this \nPresident never sought or heeded advice of the Senate. Now he demands \nour consent.\n  That is not how America works. The Senate is not a rubber stamp for \nthe executive branch. Rather, we are the one institution where the \nminority has the voice and ability to check the power of the majority. \nToday, in the face of President Bush's power grab, it is more important \nthan ever. Republicans want one-party rule. The Senate is the last \nplace where the President and Republicans can't have it all. Now the \nPresident wants to destroy our checks and balances to assure that he \ndoes get it all.\n\n[[Page S5456]]\n\n  That check on his power is the right to extended debate. Every \nSenator can stand on behalf of the people who have sent them here and \nsay their piece. In the Senate's 200-plus years of history, this has \nbeen done hundreds and hundreds of times--stand up to popular \nPresidents, to unpopular Presidents, arrogant with power, to block \nlegislation harmful to American workers in the eyes of the Senator, \nand, yes, even to reject Presidential nominations, even judicial \nnominations.\n  Who are the nominees now before this Senate?\n  Priscilla Owen is a Texas Supreme Court justice nominated to the \nFifth Circuit. She sides with big business and corporate interests \nagainst workers and consumers in case after case regardless of what the \nlaw is. Her colleagues on the conservative Texas court have written \nthat she legislates from the bench. Her own colleagues have called her \nopinions ``nothing more than inflammatory rhetoric,'' her \ninterpretation of the law to be ``misconceptions,'' and those are \nquotes, and even rebuked her for second-guessing the legislature on \nvital pieces of legislation. If she wanted to legislate, she should run \nfor Congress. If she wants to interpret and uphold the law, she should \nbe a judge. She cannot do both. And I might note that the Attorney \nGeneral of the United States has called her activism unconscionable.\n\n  I read to the Senate yesterday what that word means. Unconscionable. \nIt, Mr. President, means that her acts are out of the mainstream for \nsure. Let me flip open my dictionary here. ``Unconscionable.'' \n``Shockingly unjust'' and ``unscrupulous.'' That is what the Attorney \nGeneral of the United States said about Priscilla Owen. I repeat: \n``shockingly unjust, unscrupulous.'' He served with her on the supreme \ncourt. He should know.\n  In case after case, her record marks her as a judge willing to make \nlaw from the bench rather than follow the language of the legislature \njudicial precedent. She has demonstrated this tendency most clearly in \na series of dissents involving a Texas law providing for a judicial \nbypass of parental notification requirements for minors seeking \nabortion. She sought to erect barriers that did not exist in law such \nas requiring religious counseling for minors. Good idea, perhaps, but \nnot something that you do from the bench. It should be done by the \nlegislature.\n  Janice Rogers Brown, a supreme court justice from California, \nnominated to the DC Circuit, is using her seat on the bench to wage an \nideological war against America's social safety net. She wants to take \nAmerica back to the 19th century and undo the New Deal which includes \nSocial Security and vital protections for working Americans like the \nminimum wage. Every Senator in this body should tell the more than 10 \nmillion working Americans already living in poverty on the minimum wage \nwhy someone who wants to make their life harder and destroy their hopes \nand dreams should be elevated for a lifetime to one of most powerful \ncourts in the country. She has been nominated to a court that overseas \nthe actions of Federal agencies responsible for worker protections, \nenvironmental laws and civil rights and consumer protection. She has \nmade no secret of her disdain for Government. According to Justice \nBrown, Government destroys families, takes property, is the cause of a \n``debased, debauched culture,'' and threatens civilization. That is her \nstatement.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Would my colleague yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I would be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my colleague. I think my colleague was in the \nChamber yesterday when Senator Frist first rose to speak and talked \nabout the 214 years of tradition of not doing filibusters of judges. I \nasked him about his vote on March 8, 2000, 5:51 p.m. He voted to \nfilibuster Judge Paez. In fact, it was clearly a filibuster. The \nstatement of the leader of that filibuster, who was Senator Smith, our \nformer colleague from New Hampshire, is obvious. The Senator ``led a \nfilibuster yesterday on the nomination of Richard Paez.'' You may \nremember that Senator Frist said he would return to the floor yesterday \nand answer how he could distinguish between saying there is a grand \ntradition in the Senate of no filibuster, but he participated in one. \nJust 5 years ago. My colleague was on the floor--I was not--earlier \nthis morning. I had hoped to get here when Senator Frist spoke. I would \njust ask my colleague, did he hear any answer to that question which \nSenator Frist has promised?\n  Mr. REID. I say through the Chair to my friend, I was present and \nparticipated in attempting to break the filibuster of Paez. I know how \nthe distinguished Republican leader voted. I was here this morning, and \nI heard no answer to the question asked by the Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. So it would be fair to say that he has still not \nanswered the question, even though he said yesterday that he would come \nback and answer it.\n  Mr. REID. He has not done that publicly. That is correct.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my colleague for yielding for a question.\n  Mr. REID. Justice Brown received a ``not qualified'' rating from the \nCalifornia judicial commission when she was nominated for the Supreme \nCourt of California because of her tendency to inject her political and \nphilosophical views into her opinions and complaints that she was \ninsensitive to established legal precedent.\n  Speaking recently at church on ``Justice Sunday,'' Justice Brown \nproclaimed a ``war'' between religious people and the rest of America. \nImagine that. Is this someone we want protecting the constitutional \ndoctrine of the separation of church and state or freedom for all \nAmericans to practice religion?\n  She has expanded the rights of corporations at the expense of \nindividuals--arguing to give corporations more leeway against attempts \nto prevent consumer fraud--some of these things make you smile--to stop \nthe sale of cigarettes to minors, to prevent discrimination against \nwomen and individuals. She may be the daughter of a sharecropper, but \nshe has never looked back to ensure legal rights of millions of \nAmericans still fighting to build better lives for their children and \ntheir children's children. They may not be sharecroppers, but they live \nlike sharecroppers, and she has done nothing to protect them.\n  These are the nominees over which the Republican leadership is waging \nthis fight, and they are prepared to destroy the Senate that has \nexisted for 200 years to do so.\n  The Senate is a body of moderation. While the House is the voice of a \nsingle man, single woman, and the House of Representatives is a voice \nof the majority, the Senate is the forum of the States. It is the \nsaucer that cools the coffee. It is the world's greatest deliberative \nbody. How will we call this the world's greatest deliberative body \nafter the majority breaks the rules to silence the minority? Breaking \nthe rules to change the rules. This vision of our Government--the \nvision of our Founding Fathers--no longer suits President Bush and the \nRepublicans in the Senate. They don't want consensus or compromise. \nThey don't want advice and consent. They want absolute power.\n  To get it, the President and majority leader will do all they can to \nsilence the minority in the Senate and remove the last check we have in \nWashington against this abuse of power. The White House is trying to \ngrab power over two separate branches of government--Congress and the \njudiciary. They are enlisting the help of the Republican Senate \nleadership to do it. Republicans are demanding a power no President has \never had, and they are willing to break the rules to do it.\n  Make no mistake. This is about more than breaking the rules of the \nSenate or the future of seven radical judges. At the end of day, this \nis about the rights and freedoms of millions of Americans. The attempt \nto do away with the filibuster is nothing short of clearing the trees \nfor the confirmation of an unacceptable nominee to the Supreme Court. \nIf the majority gets its way, President Bush and the far, far right \nwill have the sole power to put whoever they want on the Supreme \nCourt--Pat Robertson, Phyllis Schlafly. They don't want someone who \nrepresents the values of all Americans, someone who can win bipartisan \nconsensus. They want someone who can skate through with only a bare \npartisan majority, someone whose beliefs are on the fringes of our \nsociety. Nobody will be able to stop them from\n\n[[Page S5457]]\n\nplacing these people on the highest court of the land--extremist judges \nwho won't protect our rights and who hold values far outside the \nmainstream of America.\n  Here is what is really at stake: The civil rights of millions of \nAmericans; voting rights of millions of Americans; the right to clean \nwater to drink and safe air to breathe for millions of Americans; the \nright to free speech and religious briefs for millions of Americans; \nthe right to equality, opportunity, and justice for millions of \nAmericans; nothing less than the individual rights and liberties of all \nAmericans.\n  It is up to us to say no to the abuse of power, to stand up for the \nConstitution. We need people who have the ability to be profiles in \ncourage. Let the President and the Republican Party know that the \nSupreme Court is not theirs to claim.\n  The debate all comes down to this: Will we let George Bush turn the \nSenate into a rubber stamp to fill the Supreme Court with people from \nthe extreme right's wish list, or will we uphold the Constitution's use \nof advice and consent powers to free the President to be like other \nPresidents have been, to force the President to look at the mainstream? \nI hope it is the latter. I know that is what my fellow Democrats and I \nwill fight for, and I hope there are at least six responsible \nRepublicans who will stand up and have the courage to join in this \nmomentous battle.\n  Will the Chair advise me as to what the order is now for debate to go \nforward on the nomination?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time on the minority side has now expired, \nand the time from now until approximately 10:45 is under the control of \nthe majority leader or his designee.\n  Mr. REID. And then after that, we will go an hourly basis.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. I hope I didn't inconvenience the majority with taking too \nmuch time. If I did, we will try to readjust it later.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am pleased the debate on Priscilla \nOwen is beginning to give her side of the story. We are finally getting \npast the sweeping mischaracterizations about her that have been put \nforward in the news media for years by interest groups--those who say \nshe is outside the mainstream, or she is an extremist. But now on the \nfloor of the Senate we are getting down to specifics.\n  Every single time we have been able to examine a specific criticism \nof a particular opinion by Justice Owen, that criticism has been \nclearly and decisively refuted. Justice Owen is a careful and \nthoughtful jurist. She is an extremely talented intellect. She uses her \nability to read every statute and enforce it fairly. She is the very \nmodel of a judge who interprets the law and does not legislate on the \nbench.\n  Let's get to the heart of the matter. One of the major criticisms of \nJustice Owen is her effort to interpret a 1999 law passed by the Texas \nState legislature requiring parental notification before a minor can \nobtain an abortion. Most of the groups opposing Justice Owen \nstrenuously opposed passage of that law in the first place. But the \nTexas legislature did approve a parental notification requirement with \na strong bipartisan majority, favoring it in both the Texas House and \nSenate. The House was controlled by Democrats at the time, and it \nrequired any minor seeking an abortion to notify at least one parent, \nor receive permission from a judge to bypass that step. It was later up \nto the supreme court to interpret that bill.\n  The law did not provide clear direction to the justices on several \nkey points. We are talking about 13 cases that came to the supreme \ncourt for review. As sometimes occurs, the court was divided in how to \ninterpret the law, particularly the portion allowing a minor to bypass \nparental notification by going to court. Some justices--a majority--\nlooked to other States on how their courts interpreted their parental \nnotification statutes, even though those States that had different laws \nand different legislative histories. Other justices, including Justice \nOwen, looked first at the intent of the Texas legislature. She then \nlooked to rulings of the U.S. Supreme Court. She reasoned, correctly, \nthat the legislature had attempted to fashion the law to conform with \nSupreme Court rulings.\n  Still other justices, I should add, took a different approach to \nanalyze the bypass provision and, in some cases, they would have \nrequired greater restrictions on use of the judicial bypass than \nJustice Owen would have imposed. One of Justice Owen's colleagues on \nthe supreme court at that time was Alberto Gonzales, now the U.S. \nAttorney General. The opposition to Justice Owen rests much of its case \non a single phrase in one of then Justice Gonzales's opinions in which \nhe referred to judicial activism.\n  He later, and under oath, clarified what he was talking about. He \nsaid:\n\n       ``My comment about an act of judicial activism was not \n     focused at Judge Owen or Judge Hecht; it was actually focused \n     at me.''\n\n  This is a tragically misleading statement to be used against Justice \nOwen. First, judges disagree. That is why we have a nine-member court. \nThey argue with each other. They accuse each other of misreading the \nstatutes. That is exactly the way it goes in many opinions. In fact, \nevery member of the Texas Supreme Court was accused by one justice or \nanother of judicial activism during the course of their service on the \ncourt.\n  Attorney General Gonzales has testified under oath that he was not \nreferring to Justice Owen's opinion when he wrote the offending phrase. \nHe said he was referring to himself. That by itself should dispose of \nthe matter. Elsewhere in the same opinion, Justice Gonzales wrote \nanother sentence. Curiously, that sentence is never cited by opponents \nof Justice Owen.\n\n  Let me quote what Justice Gonzales wrote:\n\n       Every member of this court agrees that the duty of a judge \n     is to follow the law as written by the legislature.\n\n  In other words, he specifically stated that none of the nine justices \non the Texas Supreme Court is a judicial activist.\n  Finally, let me point out that Justice Gonzales was White House \ncounsel when President Bush nominated Justice Owen for the Fifth \nCircuit in 2001. In other words, General Gonzales was in charge of the \nprocess that produced Justice Owen's nomination. Does anybody seriously \nbelieve he would select a nominee for this position if he thought she \nwere a judicial activist?\n  I want to look at the 13 cases from a statistical standpoint. Justice \nOwen is solidly in the mainstream of her court. In these 13 rulings, \nJustice Owen was in the majority 10 times and found herself in dissent \nonly on 3 occasions. She disagreed with the majority decision three \ntimes. In those 13 cases, the Texas Supreme Court required notification \n6 times and facilitated a judicial bypass 7 times. So Justice Owen \nvoted to require parental notification in nine cases and to facilitate \nthe judicial bypass in four. Remember, no case on judicial bypass \nreached the Texas Supreme Court at all unless it had first been denied \nby two courts and by up to four judges. This is important, because \nunder our system, the trial court is charged with ascertaining the \nfacts in a case. In other words, Justice Owen is being faulted for \nbeing more willing to defer to trial court findings of fact because she \nknows trial judges have the unique ability to assess a witness's \ndemeanor and credibility.\n  Now, was Justice Owen's approach in the mainstream? Earlier this \nweek, the Senate was visited by a group of six Texans. They represent \ndiverse views, but they came to Washington to support Justice Owen and \nasked for fair treatment of her. They included Tom Phillips, who was \nChief Justice of the Texas Supreme Court for most of the time Justice \nOwen had served. It included Elizabeth Whitaker, past president of the \nState Bar of Texas--one of 15 past State bar presidents, Republicans \nand Democrats, who are supporting Justice Owen's nomination.\n  In the group was Linda Eads, a former assistant State attorney \ngeneral, who is now a professor at the Southern Methodist University \nSchool of Law. She specializes in constitutional law. Linda Eads \ndescribes herself as strongly pro-choice. She also said she disagreed \nwith Justice Owen on parental bypass. But she emphasized that Justice \nOwen's judicial approach to\n\n[[Page S5458]]\n\nthese cases was thoughtful and rational. She said it was easily within \nthe respectable judicial mainstream on interpreting legislation. She \nended by saying she strongly supports the confirmation of Priscilla \nOwen.\n  Finally, I want to talk about the intent of the Texas Legislature. I \nserved in that legislature for two terms, years ago. I know most of the \nmembers of the Texas House and Senate.\n  It is interesting to me that opponents of Justice Owen accuse her of \nmisreading legislative intent by requiring more parental involvement \nthan the legislators intended. I believe the opposite might well be \ntrue. In fact, the legislature is currently in the process of \ndiscussing a new law that would strengthen parental involvement and \nrequire parental consent, not parental notification. That bill has \npassed the Texas House and the Texas Senate. It is now in a conference \ncommittee.\n  Justice Owen is highly respected in Texas. Allow me to quote from a \nletter sent by Senator Florence Shapiro, the chief sponsor of the \nparental notification act approved by the legislature in 1999. She \nsays:\n\n       As a Senator in the Texas Legislature, the manner in which \n     the Texas courts review and interpret our laws is extremely \n     important to me. Justice Owen's opinions consistently \n     demonstrate that she faithfully interprets the law as it is \n     written, and as the Legislature intended, not based on her \n     subjective idea of what the law should be. I am saddened to \n     see that partisan and extremist opponents of Justice Owen's \n     nomination have attempted to portray her as an activist \n     judge, as nothing could be further from the truth.\n       Her opinions interpreting the Texas Parental Notification \n     act serve as prime examples of her judicial restraint . . . I \n     appreciated that Justice Owen's opinions throughout the \n     series of cases looked carefully at the new statute and at \n     the governing U.S. Supreme Court precedent upon which the \n     language of the statute was based, to detennine what the \n     Legislature intended the Act to do.\n       I, along with many of my colleagues--Democrats and \n     Republicans alike--filed a bipartisan amicus curiae brief \n     with the Texas Supreme Court explaining that the language of \n     the Act was crafted in order to promote, except in very \n     limited circumstances, parental involvement.\n       Prior to the passage of the Act, a child could go to a \n     doctor and have an extremely invasive procedure without even \n     notifying one of her parents. At the same time, school nurses \n     were not even permitted to give aspirin to a child without \n     parental consent. Like legislators in dozens of states across \n     America, we realized that something needed to be done to \n     respect the role of parents--that at least one parent should \n     be involved in a major medical decision impacting their minor \n     daughter.\n       Because this was not an ``abortion'' bill but a ``parental \n     involvement'' bill supported by lawmakers on both sides of \n     the abortion debate, we were able to pass a bipartisan law \n     that promotes the relationship between parents and their \n     minor daughters and is exceedingly popular with the people of \n     Texas.\n       Justice Owen is the kind of judge that the people of the \n     5th Circuit need on the bench--an experienced jurist who \n     follows the law and uses common sense. I strongly urge the \n     committee to reject the politics of personal destruction \n     pushed by Justice Owen's extremist critics and vote \n     positively on her nomination. She merits immediate \n     confirmation.\n\n  That is a letter from State Senator Florence Shapiro.\n  Let's be clear about what is going on here. A number of interest \ngroups fought against legislative enactment of the parental \nnotification law. They lost. Now they are trying to undercut a judge \nwho, as honestly and fairly as she could, attempted to interpret that \nlaw. They are entitled to their opinion. They should vote their \nconvictions. Priscilla Owen deserves an up-or-down vote on her \nnomination to the Fifth Circuit.\n  I want to respond to the distinguished Democratic leader, who this \nmorning said that Owen and 10 other nominees have all received votes in \nthe Senate. Senator Reid left out one important detail, and that is--if \nshe had gotten a confirmation vote on the floor of the U.S. Senate, \nJustice Owen would be sitting on the Fifth Circuit today. Indeed, this \nSenate has taken four cloture votes on Priscilla Owen, and each time \nshe has received more than a majority--the standard for confirmation in \nthe Senate--until the Congress of 2 years ago.\n  She would be confirmed by the Senate. Senator Reid is correct that \nnominees have received cloture votes, in an attempt to override \nfilibusters. But requiring a 60-vote threshold to proceed to \nconfirmation is not the Senate's practice. Justice Owen continues to \nwait patiently for the Senate to confirm her; she has been waiting for \nfour years.\n  The Senate Republicans have asked the minority to allow the Senate to \nvote, but they have refused and continue to vote no on cloture, thereby \nchanging the Constitution without going through the process of a \nconstitutional amendment.\n  When the Constitution requires a supermajority, it is explicit. Just \nbefore the advise and consent part of the Constitution, it does have a \nstandard of a two-thirds vote, but that was not put in the article on \nconfirmation of judges. The clear constitutional interpretation is that \nif a supermajority is required, it is stated in the Constitution. And \nfor over 200 years, this body has recognized that and has made a \nmajority vote the standard until the last session of the Senate.\n  It is disingenuous for the other side to suggest that these 10 \nnominees have had votes because if they had, they would be sitting on \nthe benches for which they were nominated. But instead, Priscilla Owen, \nafter being confirmed by the Senate four times, is back again.\n  I think we can do better. I think we can acknowledge the Constitution \nand acknowledge that if we are going to amend the Constitution, the \nSenate should start the process of a constitutional amendment. The \nConstitution is clear that a majority vote is required, and that has \nbeen the standard for over 200 years in the Senate until the last \nsession of Congress.\n  I hope Priscilla Owen will get an up-or-down vote, because if she \ndoes, the tradition of the Senate and our respect for the Constitution \nwill be clear. Again, if they want to change it, perhaps they should go \nabout it in the right way, and introduce a constitutional amendment to \nrequire a super-majority for confirmation of judges.\n  I think the Founding Fathers were geniuses and knew a balance of \npower had to be delicate among the three branches of Government. They \nenvisioned a President appointing circuit court judges with the Senate \nhaving the authority to confirm or reject them with a simple majority \nvote. The balance of power in our Constitution has kept our country \nstrong and has been the anchor for our democracy.\n  Priscilla Owen is a wonderful human being who has been demonized for \n4 years. She has already displayed her judicial temperament by not \nresponding to the unfair criticisms, by showing no bitterness, and by \nharboring no anger. But she is a human being, a good person, and she \ndeserves an up-or-down vote. When she gets an up-or-down vote, she will \nbe confirmed and become a brilliant member of the Fifth Circuit Court \nof Appeals.\n  I hope the Senate is on the brink of doing the right thing by these \nnominees, by acting as the lofty body it is, can be, and should be. I \nhope we will treat everyone who comes before us with respect. I do not \nthink that has been the case for this very fine supreme court justice \nfor the State of Texas. I hope that is going to change. I hope we will \ntreat her as she should be treated. I hope she will get her up-or-down \nvote which will show that her 4 years of patience have allowed us to do \nthe right thing and she will be able to serve our country in a way that \nI know she will make all of us proud.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Isakson). The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, in recent weeks, the American people, including the \ncitizens of Louisiana, have heard a lot about Senate rules, about \nhistorical precedent, about something very confusing called the \nfilibuster, about the Senate's constitutional duty, and advice and \nconsent. I think for the average American, for the average Louisianan, \nthis seems pretty esoteric. This seems pretty out of touch with their \neveryday lives, this issue of how the Senate governs itself.\n  But there are issues at the heart of this which are important to \nthose citizens, including my constituents in Louisiana. And those \nissues are: Is the Senate going to do its job? Are we as Senators going \nto do our job and do the people's business, address important issues of \nthe day to build up our country and make it better?\n\n[[Page S5459]]\n\n  Also, there is the fundamental issue of fairness. Are we going to be \nfair in this process to all concerned?\n  Those are themes, those are issues to which Americans all across the \ncountry, certainly my citizens in Louisiana relate and care about. Are \nwe going to do the people's business? Are we going to act in a way that \nis fair to all? Those are issues directly at the heart of this debate--\ndoing the people's business.\n  Last year, I ran for the Senate for the first time. In doing so, of \ncourse, I traveled all around Louisiana and talked to citizens of all \nwalks of life in every corner of the State. One theme I heard over and \nover from all sorts of folks of both parties was: Please go up there \nand do what is right and do the people's business. Get beyond all of \nthis bitter partisanship, this obstructionism, the filibuster. Do the \npeople's business in terms of important issues of the day. That is what \nfolks in Louisiana told me over and over again.\n  They care about putting good people on the bench and having our \ncourts run properly and filling these vacancies. They also care about \nother important business--passing a highway bill, building \ninfrastructure so we can create good jobs in this country and \nLouisiana, passing a national energy policy to get us on track in terms \nof energy independence. That is important for our national security, \nand that is important for our economic security.\n  Again, wherever I went, with whomever I talked--Black, White, \nDemocrat, Republican, and everyone in between--folks said over and \nover: Look, we are sending you there to do our business, to face \nissues, to vote, to move forward as a country, not to obstruct, not to \nplay political games, not to get mired in bitter partisanship, but to \ntake care of us and to address our concerns. And that is important.\n  The other issue that is at the heart of this debate that ordinary \ncitizens around the country and Louisiana care about is fairness. Are \nyou going to act in a way that is fundamentally fair to everybody \nconcerned? And, of course, that is at issue here as well.\n  We have judicial nominees who have been nominated not weeks ago or \nmonths ago but, in many cases, years ago; in some cases, over 4 years \nago. Their lives have been disrupted. They have been attacked by \ninterest groups around the country, as well as Members of Congress. \nMany charges have been leveled against them that are patently untrue \nand patently unfair. And after all of that turmoil, after all of those \ntrials and tribulations, they do not even get an up-or-down vote on the \nfloor of the Senate. There is no resolution to the trial, the jury \nnever comes back. We do not get to vote and say this person should be \non the court or this person should not be on the court. That is not \nfair. That is not fair in the minds of any ordinary American. It is not \nfair in the minds of the citizens of Louisiana.\n\n  We need to bring some fundamental fairness to this process. Sure, we \nneed to have an important debate. Sure, we need to vet all the \ninformation. We can have differences of opinion. But then at the end of \nthe day, we need to have resolution, we need to have an up-or-down \nvote. It is time to do that with all of these judicial nominees.\n  We have a historic opportunity in the Senate right now to address \nboth of those concerns: to do the people's business, to do our job, to \nvote, and to move on to other key issues, such as the highway bill, \nbuilding jobs, building energy independence--and we have the \nopportunity to act honorably and with fundamental fairness by treating \nall concerned in a fundamentally fair way in giving these nominees an \nup-or-down vote.\n  I stand on the Senate floor today to ask that we all come together to \ndo that because that is the right thing to do, not for party leaders, \nnot for the President, or for interest groups on the left or the right. \nIt is the right thing to do for the American people. It is the right \nthing to do for the citizens of each of our respective States.\n  I make a plea in particular to my colleague from Louisiana, Senator \nLandrieu, to do that. She is in a unique position to reach out and \nachieve fundamental fairness and do the people's business in a \nconstructive way.\n  Many folks, including me, quite frankly, were disappointed that a few \nyears ago Senator Landrieu filibustered and supported that filibuster \nof Miguel Estrada, another highly qualified judicial nominee, after she \nhad expressed strong support of that very nomination in her reelection \ncampaign.\n  This is an opportunity to set that record aside and do the right \nthing and give all of these judicial nominees a fair up-or-down vote. \nThat is what the folks of Louisiana want: to do the people's business, \nto do our job, to vote and to address other important issues and to act \nhonorably and bring fundamental fairness, proper American values, \nLouisiana values to this process.\n  We are beginning with a very important nomination to the people of \nLouisiana, Priscilla Owen of Texas. It is particularly important to my \ncitizens of Louisiana because the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, \nto which Judge Owen is nominated, serves Louisiana, covers all of \nLouisiana. There has been a vacancy in that position for years and \nyears.\n  Judge Owen has been nominated for over 4 years. Her nomination has \nbeen thoroughly vetted, thoroughly debated and, yet we have never had \nthat closure. We have never had that fair up-or-down vote. In fact, the \nvacancy which she would fill has been declared a judicial emergency in \nthe Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, impacting directly Louisiana \nbecause it has been open for so long.\n  So this is the perfect place to start for me, for Senator Landrieu, \nfor those who are concerned about justice in the Fifth Circuit, taking \ncare of that judicial emergency, and then we should move on and give \nall of these nominees a fair up-or-down vote.\n  Justice Owen has been maligned unfairly. All sorts of charges have \nbeen leveled against her, and I want to address some of those directly. \nShe has been called fringe and out of the mainstream, way out of the \nmainstream of American opinion and everyday life. Yet if you take any \nserious look at the facts, that charge simply does not hold up.\n  Justice Owen has been on the Texas Supreme Court since 1994, but more \nsignificantly, when she was reelected to that position, she was \nreelected with 84 percent of the vote in Texas, with the endorsement of \nevery major newspaper of the State and with bipartisan support.\n  Now, is every newspaper in the State fringe, out of the mainstream? \nAre 84 percent of Texas voters fringe and out of the mainstream? \nObviously not.\n  In addition, in her nomination to the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of \nAppeals, Justice Owen gained the highest rating possible from the \nAmerican Bar Association.\n  She was nominated on May 9, 2001, nearly 4 years ago, and renominated \nJanuary 7, 2003, and February 14, 2005. Her qualifications have been \nvetted and debated exhaustively.\n  Owen has significant bipartisan support, including three former \nDemocrat judges on the Texas Supreme Court and a bipartisan group of 15 \npast presidents of the State Bar of Texas.\n  Owen has been a justice on the Texas Supreme Court since 1994 and was \nendorsed for reelection by every major Texas newspaper.\n  Owen previously practiced commercial litigation for 17 years. She \nalso has a substantial record of pro bono and community activity.\n  Owen received her undergraduate degree from Baylor University and \ngraduated third in her class from Baylor Law School in 1977. She was a \nmember of the law review and has been honored as Baylor Young Lawyer of \nthe Year and as a Baylor University Outstanding Young Alumna.\n  After graduating from law school, Justice Owen received the highest \nscore in the State on the Texas bar exam in December 1977.\n  The American Bar Association unanimously rated Justice Owen ``well \nqualified,'' its highest possible rating.\n  Some weeks ago, I also spoke on this floor in support of Justice \nBrown, whose nomination recently cleared the Judiciary Committee for \nthe second time. The President nominated her to the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the DC Circuit Court nearly 2 years ago. One-fourth of the \nDC Circuit is currently vacant; and Justice Brown's nomination has \nstrong support.\n  As I noted before, during Justice Brown's 9-year-tenure on the \nCalifornia Supreme Court, she has acquired a reputation as a fair and \nintelligent justice\n\n[[Page S5460]]\n\nwho is committed to the rule of law. Justice Brown has served on the \nCalifornia Supreme Court since May 1996. Her appointment to that court \nwas historic: Justice Brown is the first African-American woman ever to \nhave served as an associate justice on the California Supreme Court.\n  Even more impressive, Justice Brown was recently returned to that \ncourt with the approval of 76 percent of California voters. In her \nretention election, Justice Brown had the highest vote percentage of \nall justices on the ballot.\n  Another sign of Brown's credibility is that, in 2002, she wrote more \nmajority opinions than any of her colleagues on the California Supreme \nCourt. As stated by a bipartisan group of Justice Brown's former \njudicial colleagues: ``she has quickly become one of the most prolific \nauthors of majority opinions on the California Supreme Court.'' At \nleast 12 judges have signed letters in support of her confirmation. \nSuch numbers are indicators of the high esteem in which she is held by \nboth the voting public in California and by her judicial colleagues.\n  I have heard arguments from some of my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle that Justice Brown should not be confirmed by this \nChamber. One argument is that she supposedly abhors Government. Another \nargument is that she is supposedly hostile to civil rights. Such \narguments are entirely without merit, and I would like to respond to \nthis attack on Justice Brown.\n  While her critics charge that Justice Brown abhors Government, this \nnominee is hardly an extremist when it comes to Government. Indeed, as \na longtime public servant, Justice Brown has been part of our \nGovernment for 25 years. She thinks there are many things Government \ndoes well, many things only Government can do; and she has criticized \nthe unintended consequences of some of the things that Government does. \nIn her judicial decisions, Justice Brown strives to apply the law as it \nexists and she defers to the legislature's judgment on how to solve \nmany social or economic issues.\n  This nominee's judicial opinions suggest that she fully appreciates \nthe importance of having Government play an active role in certain \nareas, including efforts to protect the public's health and safety. \nThat is why she voted to uphold State health standards for labeling \nmilk products. That is why she agreed that faucets, which might contain \nlead, should be considered a source of drinking water, under the \nGovernment's Safe Drinking Water Program. And that is why she agreed \nthat her State's regulations regarding overtime pay should be liberally \ninterpreted to provide California workers with more protection than \nthey would have had under Federal law.\n  Her opponents also have insinuated that Justice Brown is hostile to \ncivil rights. But Justice Brown has stated in her judicial opinions \nthat ``discrimination on the basis of race is illegal, immoral, \nunconstitutional, inherently wrong, and destructive of democratic \nsociety.''\n\n  In writing for a unanimous court, Justice Brown struck down a certain \nminority aid program because it violated Proposition 209, a provision \nof the California constitution that bars discrimination against, or \npreferential treatment to, any individual group on the basis of race, \nsex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in the operation of public \nemployment, public education, or public contracting. Every judge in \nCalifornia who reviewed this program found it unconstitutional.\n  I find the argument that she is hostile to civil rights to be simply \nincredible, when you consider Justice Brown's personal history as an \nAfrican-American who came of age in the South in the midst of Jim Crow \nlaws. As someone who attended segregated schools, Justice Brown, better \nthan anyone, can appreciate the importance of fighting discrimination. \nShe grew up in Alabama, the daughter of sharecroppers, listening to her \ngrandmother's stories about NAACP lawyer Fred Gray, who defended Dr. \nMartin Luther King and Rosa Parks. Her rise to the California Supreme \nCourt from humble beginnings in the segregated South is absolutely \ninspiring. That may be why she has been sensitive to claims of racial \nprofiling in cases where the facts strongly supported such an \ninference.\n  We all know that Justice Brown has risen to a prominent position on \nthe California Supreme Court. But not everyone is aware of Justice \nBrown's record of activities on behalf of minorities, children, and the \nunderprivileged. Let me take this opportunity to highlight a few such \nactivities:\n  Justice Brown served as a member of the California Commission on the \nStatus of African-American Males. The Commission made recommendations \non how to address inequities in the treatment of African-American males \nin employment, business development, and the criminal justice and \nhealth care systems.\n  She served on the Governor's Child Support Task Force, which reviewed \nand made recommendations on how to improve California's child \nenforcement system.\n  While serving as a member of the Community Learning Advisory Board of \nthe Rio Americano High School, Justice Brown developed a program to \nprovide Government service internships to high school students in \nSacramento, CA.\n  I close by citing a statement in support of Justice Brown by an \nexecutive director of Minorities in Law Enforcement: ``We recommend the \nconfirmation of Justice Brown based on her broad range of experience, \npersonal integrity, good standing in the community and dedication to \npublic service. . . Justice Brown is a fair and just person with \nimpeccable honesty, which is the standard by which justice is carried \nout.''\n  In closing, I urge my colleagues to allow both Justice Brown and \nJustice Owen to have a vote on the Senate floor. Let Justice Brown's \njudicial qualifications, rather than her political philosophy, be our \nfocus in her confirmation process.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At this time, the majority's time has expired.\n  The majority whip.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for a couple of \nminutes to make requests for committees to meet in the Senate and to \nmake just a brief statement, 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, before I object, I could not hear the \nSenator.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent for 2 minutes to make a \nrequest for committees to meet, which my assumption is the Senator from \nIowa will object to, and then just to make a very brief statement, a \ntotal of 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I have 10 unanimous consent requests \nfor committees to meet during today's session of the Senate. They have \nthe approval of the majority leader. I ask unanimous consent that these \nrequests be agreed to and be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, on behalf of the Democratic leader, myself \nand, I might add, others on this side, because of the importance of the \ndebate that is taking place on the Senate floor today, the Senate's \nattention ought to be turned to this and not to committee meetings, and \ntherefore I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator objects.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. If I could reclaim the balance of my brief time, what \nwe have is a further effort to make it impossible to do the people's \nbusiness in the Senate. The normal way we do business is for action to \nbe going on on the floor, and additional action in committees at the \nsame time. As a result of these objections, we have thwarted progress. \nWe have thwarted progress on an energy bill, on a JOBS bill, on a \ndisaster relief bill. Yesterday, an Intelligence Committee meeting had \nto be cancelled. Here we are in the middle of the war on terror and the \nIntelligence Committee was not allowed to meet.\n  Today's objections will shut down our meetings on the Energy bill, a \nclosed CIA briefing on terrorism and proliferation of weapons in Iran, \nthe Foreign Relations Committee, on strengthening America's workforce \nover at the Labor Committee, another Intelligence Committee shutdown by \nthis action and, of course, the Judiciary Committee will not be able to \ncontinue its markup of the asbestos bill.\n  We are following the regular order. The majority leader simply called \nup a\n\n[[Page S5461]]\n\njudicial nominee to be considered by the Senate. There is nothing \nirregular in any way about the procedure that is being followed, and \nyet our friends on the other side of the aisle are shutting down the \nbusiness of the Senate by making it impossible for committees to do the \nwork of the American people on everything from intelligence matters to \npassing an energy bill when gas prices are at record highs. This is an \nincredibly irresponsible approach to the majority's efforts simply to \nmove the people's business along by following regular order and moving \ntoward a vote on the President's nomination for the court of appeals.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator yields back.\n  The time, until 11:45 a.m., is controlled by the Democratic leader or \nhis designee.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise today to speak about the prospect that at some point next \nweek, according to all of the press reports and according to what I \nhave heard on the floor, the majority leader of the Senate will take a \ncourse of action that has been dubbed the ``nuclear option.''\n  The majority leader will take a course of action that will tear down \nthe rules by which we operate in the Senate, rules which have been laid \ndown in some cases for almost 200 years, in some cases over 100 years.\n\n  I believe we should be taking our time in the Senate because of the \neffects that this step by the majority leader could have on how we \nrepresent our constituents. It can have such a profound effect that it \nbehooves us all to think very deeply and carefully about it and to come \nto the floor to express our opinions.\n  By triggering this nuclear option, the majority leader would unleash \nforces he would regret and that everyone who loves this great Nation \nand its system of checks and balances would regret.\n  There is no question that by breaking the rules--that is what would \nhappen, breaking the rules--the majority party would gain short-term \nadvantage. They would be able to confirm every one of their judicial \nnominees, no matter how radical or out of the mainstream. But the long-\nterm destructive consequences triggering the nuclear option would be \nprofound for our system of Government.\n  For more than two centuries, Senate rules and traditions have \nrespected the rights of the minority. That would be destroyed. For more \nthan two centuries, thanks to those minority rights, the Senate has \nbeen a force for compromise, moderation, and reason. That would be \ndestroyed.\n  For more than two centuries, the minority's power in the Senate has \nbeen essential to America's system of checks and balances. That would \nbe destroyed. And something else of great importance would be \ndestroyed: Respect for rules.\n  Playing by the rules is the American way. It is one of our core \nvalues. From childhood, we are taught to respect the rules, to follow \nthe rules, to play by the rules. We are taught it is dishonorable to \nbreak the rules or to change the rules in the middle of the game, \nespecially to gain an advantage or simply to win. Ask any child, and he \nor she will say that breaking the rules or changing the rules in the \nmiddle of the game is not only unfair, it is wrong.\n  America is a great country because playing by the rules and \nrespecting rules is a core value. It is a way of life. It is at the \nheart of our athletics, our business dealings, our way of government. \nIt is no exaggeration to say that if one destroys the idea of playing \nby the rules, then they invite distrust, disorder, and the \ndisintegration of the American social fabric. They invite chaos, and \nchaos invites tyranny.\n  This is exactly why the Republican leadership's plan to resort to the \nnuclear option is so dangerous. Since 1790, the filibuster has been \nused in the Senate countless times, and nearly 100 years ago the Senate \npassed rule XXII, codifying the right of extended debate. We know what \nthat rule says. It says that it takes 67 votes to change the Senate \nrules and 60 votes to cut off debate. Those are the rules. They are \ndeeply conservative rules, rules that have been respected and honored \nfor nearly a century, until now.\n  The Republican leadership is unhappy because a small number of \njudges, all of them I consider far out of the mainstream, have been \nfilibustered by the minority. They are unhappy because they have been \nable to confirm only 95 percent of the President's judicial nominees \nand not 100 percent. This compares to only an 80-percent confirmation \nrate during the Clinton administration. The Republicans blocked 68 \nClinton judicial nominees, including, I might add, Bonnie Campbell, \nfrom my State of Iowa.\n  Most of those nominees were blocked in the Judiciary Committee by \njust one Senator. Now, does the Republican leadership celebrate the \nfact that by playing by the rules they won 95 percent of the time? Do \nthey now play by the rules and gather the votes necessary to change \nrule XXII governing filibusters? No.\n  They are going to employ a trick, a procedure, whereby the rules are \noverturned by one decision of the Presiding Officer backed by 51 votes. \nThat will destroy the rules of the Senate. Now they say: Well, it only \napplies to judges now. It can apply to anything else down the pike.\n  Now, a mere 10 Bush nominees have been blocked, and what is the \nRepublican leadership's response? It is to destroy the rules. Sweep \naside more than 200 years of Senate tradition. In its place, they will \nmake up their own rules, a new rule, that will allow them or any \nmajority to change any rule at any time for any reason with only 51 \nvotes. In other words, once the nuclear option is detonated and a new \nSenate precedent is established, this body will be subject to the whim \nof any group of 51 Senators who want to impose their will without any \nprovisions for extended debate. Make no mistake, this will be the end \nof the Senate as we know it.\n  How ironic that this is being done by Senators who call themselves \nconservative. The truth is that resort to the nuclear option, breaking \nthe rules, making up new rules convenient to the leadership, is a \nradical, unprecedented action with consequences that no one can \npredict. Because once the rules are broken and rules are made up as one \ngoes along, seeds of anarchy, of chaos, are sown. An atmosphere of \nanything goes is created, and the end justifies the means.\n  We have already seen this in the actions of House Majority Leader Tom \nDeLay. We have an honored tradition that congressional redistricting \noccurs every 10 years after the decennial census, but the majority \nleader in the House wanted to increase his majority in the House. So \nwhat did he do? He tore up the rules and made up new rules, Tom DeLay's \nrules. But the real Tom DeLay rule is this: Anything goes. The end \njustifies the means. Situational ethics. I fear we are about to adopt \nthat Tom DeLay rule in the Senate. This is profoundly bad news for this \ninstitution.\n  I am also concerned about the message it sends to businesspeople, to \nhusbands and wives, to our people. The message is if our national \nleaders can break the rules as a matter of convenience, if they can \nwrite their own rules, impose them on others, then maybe it is okay for \neveryone else to behave just like that.\n  This is a deeply disturbing prospect. I implore the distinguished \nmajority leader, Senator Frist, to consider the law of unintended \nconsequences. He is threatening to break rule XXII in order to pass 100 \npercent of the President's judicial nominees. Once the rule is \ndestroyed, and once the majority leader imposes a new rule to his \nliking, then who is to say where it will lead? It will be like an out-\nof-control virus. If 51 Senators can change any rule at any time for \nany reason, then anything is possible. The metaphor Senators are using \nis a ``nuclear option,'' and I would say that is true, it is nuclear \nbecause it does blow up this place. But there may be another metaphor, \ntoo: that the majority leader is letting the genie out of the bottle \nand there will be no putting that genie back once it is out. It will \nwreak destruction in ways no one now can predict or foresee.\n\n  For example, once the Chair can make a determination about the rules \nand have that ruling upheld by 51 votes of the Senate, what is to say \nof the time-honored tradition we have in the Senate of a Senator being \nable to have the right of the floor and being able to speak for as long \nas he or she wants? That has been our right since the\n\n[[Page S5462]]\n\nfounding of the Senate. Once a Senator is recognized, that Senator can \nspeak until they drop. I think the record is 24 or 25 hours, by former \nSenator Strom Thurmond.\n  Who is to say if, in the future, someone gets up to speak but people \nwant to move on and do something, that after that person speaks for 5 \nor 10 hours the majority leader would be recognized and make a point of \norder that the person is speaking unconstitutionally? They have the 51 \nvotes to uphold the motion and that is the end of it. So a Senator's \nright to have the floor is subject to whatever the Chair wants. We may \nget it; we may not. We may not be able to speak for an hour or 2 hours \nor whatever we want. The Chair may say to the Senator from Iowa, You \ncan speak for 3 minutes and then you have to sit down.\n  They do that in the House of Representatives. They have a 5-minute \nrule. I know, I served there. But that is not the Senate.\n  I am just saying who knows what might happen. It is possible. If we \ngo down this road that is the precedent that is set.\n  I do not know why the majority leader is doing this. Possibly what we \nare seeing here is an attempt to seize absolute power and unchecked \ncontrol of all three branches of Government. The Republicans already \ncontrol the executive branch. A majority of Supreme Court Justices are \nRepublican nominees. So are the majority of judges on our Courts of \nAppeal, the circuit courts. Indeed, there is a Republican majority on \n10 of the 12 circuits. Republicans have an iron grip on the House of \nRepresentatives. They have a 55-seat majority here in the Senate. Only \none barrier now stands in the way of the Republican Party seizing \nabsolute control of every aspect of our Government, all three branches, \nand that is the right of the minority in the Senate to filibuster.\n  By unleashing the nuclear option, the Republican leadership would \ncrush this last remaining check on its power. The filibuster is a more \nthan 200-year-old tradition in the Senate; it has withstood the test of \ntime.\n  I do not believe the nuclear option reflects the desires or values of \nthe American people. Americans are extremely wary of one-party \ndominance and control. This is a prime reason why so many voters split \ntheir ballots In the election last November. Republicans won the White \nHouse with less than 51 percent of the popular vote. The Republicans \nhave a 52-percent majority in the House. They have a 55-percent \nmajority here in the Senate. But they want to seize 100-percent control \nof the Government, including the third branch, the judicial branch.\n  It is not healthy for our country. It is not healthy for our \ndemocracy. I do not believe for 1 minute this power grab reflects the \nwishes of the American people. When it comes to government, there are \ncertain values and principles that the vast majority of Americans \nshare. We prize our system of checks and balances. We respect minority \nrights and dissent. We want to ensure that minorities are protected. We \nunderstand the danger of majorities acting without check or restraint, \nrunning roughshod over those who would disagree.\n  As a well-known minister once said:\n\n       Democracy exists not just when the majority rules, but when \n     the minority is absolutely safe.\n       The rules of the Senate and the rule of extended debate \n     give the minority that absolute safety. You take that away \n     and you take away the minority rights in the Senate. Most \n     Americans understand that checks and balances are the key to \n     preserving our liberty.\n\n  James Madison wrote:\n\n       The accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive and \n     judiciary, in the same hands may justly be pronounced the \n     very definition of tyranny.\n\n  But that is exactly the goal of the Republican leadership today. They \nseek the accumulation of all power--legislative, executive, and \njudiciary--in the same hands, their hands. This is profoundly \ndangerous. By resorting to the nuclear option, the majority would break \nthe rules in order to change the rules. Under the rules of the Senate, \nit takes 67 votes to change the rules, 60 votes to end debate on a \njudicial nominee. But by resorting to this parliamentary gimmick, this \nnuclear option, the majority would change this rule with only 51 votes. \nThe result would be to destroy any check or restraining influence on \nthe power of the majority. This is not the American way. It is \ncertainly not the wishes of the American people.\n  In debate in the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia, James \nMadison said the Senate would have two roles:\n\n       first, to protect the people against their rulers, \n     secondly, to protect the people against the transient \n     impressions into which they themselves might be led.\n\n  By attacking the filibuster, the Republican leaders would destroy the \nability of the Senate to ``protect the people against their rulers.'' \nThe Senate would lose its capacity to stand up to an out-of-control \nmajority. Instead, the Senate would be turned into a rubberstamp for \nthe majority's agenda, just as the House is a rubberstamp for the \nmajority's agenda right now. That would be a betrayal of the Senate's \ntraditional role as envisioned by the Founding Fathers.\n\n  The Constitution gave Senators 6-year terms so they would not bend to \nthe political passions of the moment. I remind my colleagues of the \nfamous exchange between Thomas Jefferson and George Washington. On his \nreturn from France, Jefferson asked Washington at the breakfast table \nwhy he favored the creation of a second Chamber, the Senate.\n  Washington replied with the question, ``Why did you pour that coffee \ninto your saucer?''\n  Jefferson said, ``To cool it.''\n  To which Washington reportedly said: ``Even so we pour legislation \ninto the senatorial saucer to cool it.''\n  For two centuries that is exactly how the Senate has worked. Because \nof the tradition of free speech and minority rights, specifically \nbecause of the threat of filibuster, Senators have a strong incentive \nto act with moderation and restraint, to make compromises, to \naccommodate the legitimate concerns of the minority. That is exactly \nwhat the nuclear option would demolish.\n  The majority party in the Senate, whether Democratic or Republican, \nhas always been frustrated by the minority's use of the filibuster. But \nI submit that frustration is the necessary byproduct of an effective \nsystem of checks and balances. It is the price we pay to safeguard \nminority rights.\n  For decades, a determined conservative minority used the filibuster \nto block civil rights legislation and deny an up-or-down vote to a \nliberal Supreme Court nominee, Abe Fortas. Progressives were extremely \nfrustrated by this exercise of minority rights and minority power.\n  Now it is the Republicans' turn to be frustrated by the filibuster. \nThey are frustrated because they can't get their way on judges 100 \npercent of the time. They have gotten their way on 95 percent of \njudicial nominees, but not 100 percent, and they believe this justifies \nbreaking the rules, to get rid of the filibuster.\n  I submit the Republicans' very frustration is evidence that the \nsystem of checks and balances here in the Senate is healthy and \nworking, working exactly as it should.\n  In 1995, I proposed to modify rule XXII in a way that would have \ngiven the minority an incentive to limit the use of the filibuster. It \nwould not have taken it away. However, my proposal bore no resemblance \nto the nuclear option. First, I did not propose to break the Senate \nrules. I played strictly by the rules. I pursued my rule change through \nnormal Senate procedures as a floor amendment. It would have taken the \nrequisite 67 votes to pass on the floor, which is entirely appropriate \nwhen changing a time-honored Senate rule. By contrast, this nuclear \noption discards the rules. It would impose the Republicans' radical \nchange with only 51 votes.\n  Ten years ago I proposed to modify the filibuster rule as a matter of \nprinciple. Today the Republican leadership wants to modify the \nfilibuster as a matter of political expedience, to make it possible to \nstack the courts with radical judges. They are pursuing unchecked \npower, the absolute control of all three branches of Government. In \nthis context, the filibuster takes on even new importance.\n  It is all that remains to check the majority's quest for absolute \npower.\n\n[[Page S5463]]\n\n  By the way, I might note parenthetically that 24 current Republican \nSenators actually voted against my proposed change to the filibuster \nback in 1995. The distinguished majority leader, Mr. Frist, was one of \nthose Republicans opposing any change to the filibuster. Indeed, as has \nbeen noted time and time again, the majority leader voted in the year \n2000, 5 years ago, to sustain a filibuster of a Clinton nominee, as did \nmany other Republicans.\n  Those same Republicans, who now say President Bush's judicial \nnominees have a constitutional right to an up-or-down vote on the \nSenate floor, denied that alleged right to scores and scores of \nPresident Clinton's judicial nominees, including, as I said earlier, a \ndistinguished Iowan, Bonnie Campbell. Ms. Campbell, a former Iowa \nattorney general, respected Justice Department official, was nominated \nfor the Eighth U.S. Circuit Court, but her nomination was blocked in \ncommittee.\n  Let's be clear. If the issue is denying nominees an up-or-down vote \nby the full Senate, there is no practical difference whatsoever between \nblocking a nominee in committee or by filibuster on the floor. During \nthe Clinton years, Republicans blocked judicial nominees again and \nagain and again. They did it in committee, they did it by blue slip, or \nthey blocked them on the floor. It didn't matter. But the nominees were \ndenied an up-or-down vote on the floor of the Senate.\n  The nuclear option is a flagrant abuse of power. The minority party, \nthe Democrats, will resist it vigorously within the rules of the \nSenate. We have a responsibility, an oath of office to defend our \nconstitutional system of checks and balances. We have a responsibility \nto defend the Senate's unique function as the last bastion of minority \nrights, as the last check on an abusive, out-of-control majority.\n  But this should not be just the responsibility of the minority party. \nIt should be the responsibility of all Senators who respect the rules \nand traditions of this body. It should be the duty of all Senators who \nvalue our democratic principles, our system of checks and balances, \nprotection of minority rights.\n  The very nature of the Senate as an institution is at stake. More \nthan that, the very nature of how we operate as a government is at \nstake. As I said, when you destroy the rules by not following the \nrules, you invite chaos. Chaos invites tyranny. This is the time to \nlook beyond party, to look beyond short-term partisan advantage.\n\n  I have every hope there will be enough Senators, Democrats and \nRepublicans alike, to disarm this destructive nuclear option. I have \nevery hope that a critical mass of Senators will be true to the rules \nand traditions of this body and that we will act to preserve the \nintegrity and independence of this great institution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Democrat leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Iowa for making clear that when \nhe offered his change in the rules relative to the filibuster, he did \nit according to the rules. When Senator Harkin suggested that we change \nthe number of votes necessary for a filibuster, he used the rules of \nthe Senate, he followed the rules of the Senate. He understood it would \ntake 67 votes for him to succeed and he pressed forward.\n  If the Republican majority today did exactly as Senator Harkin did, \nthere would be no discussion of a nuclear option. We would move to that \npoint in the calendar, we would take the vote according to the rules, \nand no one would be paying much attention because that is the routine \nof the Senate. We would be following the rules of the Senate.\n  The unique situation now presenting itself with the nuclear option is \nthat the Republican majority is going to break the rules of the Senate \nin order to change them. Instead of following Senator Harkin's model \nand example of 67 votes, they will bring Vice President Cheney to the \nchair, they will ask him to rule as a Presiding Officer of the Senate \nthat the rules are going to be changed, he will make that \npronouncement, and that is the end of the story. They will be breaking \nthe rules of the Senate to change them.\n  That is the unique difference between what Senator Harkin did many \nyears ago and what the Republican majority does today. It is historic. \nThat is why so many people are following this debate. People who never \nheard of the nuclear option are following this debate. They understand \nsomething historic is about to take place: changing a tradition, \nchanging something in the Senate, a rule that has been in place for \nover 200 years. With the wave of his hand, Vice President Cheney will \ntake away a rule that has applied for 200 years.\n  Some argue this should be viewed as another routine day in the \nSenate. I disagree. This is a historic debate and one on which I hope \nthe American people are focusing. Changing the rules in the middle of \nthe game is not accepted in most conduct in America. It shouldn't be \naccepted in the Senate. Changing the constitutional balance of the \nSenate and the White House is historic and should be followed closely \nby every single American.\n  My colleague, the Senator from Kentucky, came to the Senate earlier \nand suggested that we should go about the routine business of the \nSenate while this debate continues. We see it otherwise. We believe we \nshould focus in the Senate, as the people of America should focus on \nthis critical debate, with very few exceptions. If there are exceptions \nrelating to committee activity on national security or things of that \nnature, we will consider each and every one of those, but the routine \nbusiness of the Senate must be held up while we engage in this.\n  The core reason for this debate is the approval of judges. Since \nPresident Bush was elected, more than 95 percent of his judicial \nnominees have been approved, the highest approval rating of any \nPresident in the last 25 years. Again, 208 have been approved, 10 have \nnot been approved, and the President says: That's not good enough; I \nwant them all. No dissent, no disagreement, give me every single judge.\n  That is the reason we are here debating. To make it clear to those \nfollowing the debate, we are prepared, on a bipartisan basis, to work \nwith the White House and the Republicans to continue to approve judges, \nas we have already done 208 times with this administration. I am about \nto make a unanimous consent request that will be followed by another, \nand let me describe it first before I make it. We have had one man's \nname on the calendar longer than the pending nominee, Priscilla Owen: \nThomas Griffith of Utah, nominated to serve as circuit judge for the \nDistrict of Columbia. I voted for him as a Democrat, coming out of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee. He has been on the calendar since April 14.\n  As a show of good faith, as a show of bipartisanship, to demonstrate \nwe can work together, we can achieve things when we speak to one \nanother and when we respect one another, I will make a unanimous \nconsent request to move from the current business immediately to the \nExecutive Calendar to bring his name to the Senate with debate of, say, \n1 hour, and that he be voted on today.\n  Then when I am finished, as the minority leader, Senator Reid, did \nyesterday, I will ask that we discharge the Senate Judiciary Committee \nand immediately consider the Michigan Circuit Court nominees of \nGriffin, McKeague, and Neilson. I will, of course, allow that unanimous \nconsent request to be amended in terms of debate time necessary for \neach nominee, but we can in a matter of a few hours move four circuit \njudges through this Chamber on a bipartisan basis and demonstrate that \nthere is no need to describe our situation as a crisis. There is no \nneed to change a 200-year tradition of the Senate. There is no need to \ncall in Vice President Cheney to wipe out a rule that we can work on \ntogether. I think that is what we should do.\n  I ask unanimous consent we move to the nomination of Thomas B. \nGriffith of Utah to be U.S. circuit judge for the District of Columbia \nand that Mr. Griffith's nomination be considered with 1 hour of debate \nequally divided, and then have a rollcall vote. I make that unanimous \nconsent request.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Reserving the right to object, and I will object, let \nme say to my good friend from Illinois, this is a scheduling issue. His \nparty was in the majority for 18 months between 2001 and 2002. Then, \nMajority Leader Daschle got to decide the order of matters to be \nconsidered in the Senate. That is the prerogative of the majority \nleader.\n\n[[Page S5464]]\n\n  I am certainly pleased to hear of the enthusiastic support of my good \nfriend from Illinois for the nominee, Griffith. Nevertheless, the \nmajority leader, Senator Frist, is charged with the responsibility of \ndetermining the order in the Senate. We are on a nomination that enjoys \nbipartisan support, a majority of bipartisan support, and that is Texas \nSupreme Court Judge Priscilla Owen.\n  I am of the belief that some of the efforts to shut down the \nactivities of the Senate may be coming to a close, and I will seek the \nfloor for the purpose of offering a unanimous consent to allow the \nForeign Relations Committee to at least meet, which is good news. \nUnfortunately, other committees are still shut down by not following \nthe normal procedure in the Senate where committees are busily at work \nwhile action is occurring on the Senate floor. As a result of actions \nin the last 2 days, the Energy bill is thwarted, the JOBS bill is \nthwarted, disaster relief is thwarted, and a closed intelligence \nmeeting was not held again today. The Energy bill, the HELP Committee \nis out of action today. Asbestos is not going forward.\n  All of these efforts to delay activity in the Senate, to shut down \nthe Senate are not necessary. It is routine in the Senate for \ncommittees to be doing work while we have debate on the floor. Nothing \nextraordinary is happening on the floor. We are following regular \norder. The majority leader, as is his right, had called up a \nnomination, and we are debating it.\n  We will get around to Mr. Griffith, and I am certainly pleased to \nhear that the assistant minority leader is in favor of him. That is \ngood news. That is one, when we turn to him, I look forward to \nconfirming with not a great deal of debate.\n  With regard to the current consent agreement, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me say it is clear now this is not \nabout moving judges forward because I have offered an opportunity for \nthe Republican majority to move a circuit judge in Utah forward on a \nbipartisan basis, as most of President Bush's nominees have been moved \nforward. It is about the fact that President Bush has not had every \nsingle nominee he sent to Congress approved. More than 95 percent have \nbeen approved.\n  There is another controversy relating to the State of Michigan--and I \nsee my colleague, Senator Stabenow, is here--a controversy that goes \nback to the Clinton administration when a systematic effort was made to \ndeny any nominee, virtually any nominee sent by the Clinton White House \nto the Senate Judiciary Committee, the opportunity for a hearing and \nfair consideration.\n  Naturally, the Senators from Michigan were upset that very qualified \nmen and women were not given a chance to present their credentials and \nto come to a hearing and have a committee vote. Over the years they \nhave expressed that concern and asked there be some balance in the \nnominations to fill the vacancies.\n  At this point, I ask unanimous consent we set aside the pending \nbusiness of the Senate, discharge the Senate Judiciary Committee from \nfurther consideration and immediately consider the nomination of \nMichigan Circuit Court nominees Griffin, McKeague, and Neilson.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Reserving the right to object, and I will object, once \nagain, it is good news to hear the Senator from Illinois is going to be \nsupportive of three circuit judges from Michigan who have been denied \nan opportunity to have an up-or-down vote for many years. The majority \nleader certainly has on his list for very near future consideration all \nof those judges, and I am pleased to hear they will be in all \nlikelihood approved when they are brought up at a time of the majority \nleader's designation.\n\n  Let me repeat, all we are looking for is an up-or-down vote. We are \nnot looking for a guaranteed outcome. But my friend from Illinois is \nprobably suspicious that there will be success if up-or-down votes are \ngranted because all of the judges who have been pending have bipartisan \nmajority support.\n  We will look forward to dealing with all of the judges the Senator \nfrom Illinois would like to schedule, instead of the majority leader, \nin the very near future, but in the meantime we are dealing with the \nnomination of Justice Priscilla Owen to the Fifth Circuit.\n  Mr. President, I object.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Let me close briefly and say if the argument is being \nmade by the Republican side that there is committee activity that \nshould go on that is more important than this constitutional debate on \nthe floor of the Senate, I would also make the argument that there is \nimportant floor activity that just could have taken place. We could \nhave approved four more judges for President Bush at the circuit level, \nmoved forward on a bipartisan basis, and done it before lunch.\n  It was the decision on the Republican majority side that rather than \nbring this to a vote, bring it to closure, make progress, show we are \nworking together on a bipartisan basis, instead they are going to \ncontinue to press for the so-called nuclear option so that Vice \nPresident Cheney can wipe away a 200-year tradition in the Senate with \nthe wave of a hand. Unfortunately, that is a sad commentary on where we \nstand today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about both the \npending nomination and also the overall process involved in the debate \non free speech and checks and balances.\n  Let me first thank and support the efforts of our Democrat minority \nleader from Illinois and thank him for his eloquence on this issue and \nindicate that despite concerns about the process now and the lack of \nbipartisanship in the Sixth Circuit for the last 4\\1/2\\ years and the \nlack of ability to come together in a way to jointly support nominees \ngiven the context of this larger debate right now and the critical \nimportance of maintaining the minority views in the Senate and our \nability to fight for our States and what is important for us both, \nSenator Levin and I have agreed to allow us to move forward in a show \nof bipartisan cooperation, a show of good faith with our colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle, to move forward with three nominees for \nthe Sixth Circuit.\n  It is very disappointing to once again see that motion has an \nobjection rather than moving ahead. In fact, last week, when our \nleader, Senator Reid, made that motion to move forward on three judges \nin order to be able to get us moving in the right direction in terms of \nbipartisanship, the majority leader objected to moving forward on the \nthree Michigan nominees and immediately went to a press conference with \nHouse Republicans from Michigan to criticize us for not being willing \nto compromise and move forward on Sixth Circuit nominees.\n  This kind of politics is very disturbing and very unfortunate when we \nare trying very much to move forward and to break this gridlock and \ncreate an atmosphere where we can continue to work together on the \nissue of judges. Again, let me say that it is very unfortunate that the \nmajority leader said that three out of four judges was not enough. \nThere is an objection, a concern on both sides of the aisle, of one of \nthe nominees, but we have been willing in good faith to move forward \nwith three of the nominees and have for 4\\1/2\\ years been meeting with \nthe administration, with colleagues on both sides of the aisle, \noffering bipartisan solutions such as what other States do in terms of \nbipartisan commissions to be able to move us forward. At every turn we \nhave been told, ``no.''\n  Now when we come forward and say, let's move to three of those judges \nin the interest of the larger picture in terms of what is happening in \nthe attempt to eliminate checks and balances in our constitutional \nprocess, we, once again, are hearing, ``no.''\n  I find that very unfortunate. But I think it points to the fact that \nwhat we are seeing is a fundamental debate, not about judges, but it is \nabout free speech. It is about our constitutional system of checks and \nbalances. We have to constantly refer to the fact, as has been said \nbefore on the floor, that if it was about judges, the administration \nshould be celebrating the best record in 25 years of Presidents of \neither party: 208 to 10. There have been 208 judges confirmed on a \nbipartisan basis, to 10 whom we have objected to because they are \nincredibly outside of the mainstream of American thought. The best \nrecord in 25 years: 208 to 10.\n  What is this debate about? Well, unfortunately, it is about the fact \nthat\n\n[[Page S5465]]\n\nwe have one party--we respect that. We understand one party is in \ncontrol of the White House, the House, and the Senate, but they do not \nhave 100 percent. There are people who elected others, elected \nDemocratic Senators or Democratic House Members. They want their views \nto be represented as well in this democracy, where we work together to \nfind compromise and balance and what is best, ideally, for everyone but \ncertainly for the majority of Americans on any one decision.\n  But we are hearing, instead: No, we want total, absolute, complete \npower over what happens in the United States. That is not a democracy. \nIn fact, we are very fortunate that our Founders understood the \nimportance of checks and balances in putting together not only a House \nof Representatives, that reflects the instant will of the people, but \nalso a Senate, with a longer term--instead of a 2-year term, a 6-year \nterm--that is charged with carefully evaluating the impact of \nlegislation in a longer term view. In other words, the House is the \n``gas pedal,'' and the Senate was designed as the ``brake.'' So we can \nhave the important debates occurring in the House, and in the Senate \nhave them as well, but allow minority views to be represented in a \ndifferent kind of way.\n  On the issue of judges, our Founders were very clear. It is the third \nbranch of Government, with lifetime appointments. It is not the \nPresident's Cabinet. I supported nominees to the President's Cabinet \nwho personally I would not have selected. But the President has a \nright, within every reason, to his team for his 4 years. I have \nsupported those.\n  But this is a third branch of Government, with lifetime appointments, \nso our Founders said: We are going to give half of that responsibility \nto the President and half of that responsibility to the Senate. So \ngiven our half of the responsibility, again, we have agreed to 208 \njudges on a bipartisan basis. And using our half of the responsibility, \nwe have objected to 10. That is the record: objected to 10. And why? \nBecause those individuals, again, do not represent mainstream thought \nand would be filling lifetime appointments--not for 3 or 4 years, but \nfor three or four decades--long beyond any of us in our participation \nhere in the Senate or this President.\n  So it is important to remember that in putting together our \nConstitution and our Bill of Rights, our Founders, were very wise. I \nthink we are very fortunate we had a group of people come together to \ncreate these checks and balances.\n  It is not about just partisanship, Democrats and Republicans, it is \nabout big States and small States. It is about Great Lakes States and \nStates that do not have water. The reality is, we have a system of \nchecks and balances that has allowed us to come together and create \ncompromise, allowed us to create more mainstream decisions, because we \nhave something called a filibuster which says a Senator can stand up, \nand as long as their legs will allow or their voice will allow, they \ncan stand up and speak their mind on behalf of the people they \nrepresent, and they have the opportunity to put forward their view.\n\n  It is the minority view--not the minority party view. It may be a \nsingle person's view, but the minority view can be heard. And because a \nSenator or two or three or four believe so passionately about \nsomething, the rules then require you have to get a few more people to \nagree, you have to get 60 votes, rather than 51, because of the strong \nconcerns raised by individual Members.\n  Now, what does that mean for us in Michigan? This is not just about \njudges. In Michigan, we are very proud of our Great Lakes. We are proud \nof the fact that we not only have our Great Lakes for drinking water, \nbut for boating and tourism and economic activity. But one of the \nthings we are concerned about in Michigan is the fact that someday the \nStates in the West and the South that do not have a lot of water may \ndecide they might want our water. Well, we do not like that very much.\n  Right now, I feel very confident that Senator Levin and I, and other \nGreat Lakes Senators, would be able to stand up and present the \nminority view, to be able to use the rules of the Senate to protect our \nwater. What happens if that is gone? What happens if we no longer can \nexpress as to and fight for our State because the checks and the \nbalances have changed?\n  This is not just about judges. What about Social Security? If, in \nfact, the rules can be changed on judges, what about privatizing Social \nSecurity? Right now, we have a significant number of people to be able \nto stop the movement to dismantle Social Security, the great American \nsuccess story. But what if the rules change and the checks and balances \nchange?\n  The whole point of checks and balances, the whole point of allowing \nextended debate and forcing compromise and people coming together, is \nto bring people with calmer minds to be able to listen to each other \nand to be able to forge a bipartisan compromise. For Senators, whether \nit is their view as a Democrat or Republican or their view from their \nState or their view because of some other consideration which causes \nthem to feel so passionately that what is being put forward is wrong, \nit forces us to work together. That is a great thing. That is something \nwe have benefited from as a country. We need to protect that as \nAmericans.\n  Let me say also that it is very ironic, as we are talking about the \nfilibuster--I find particularly in Michigan--that when we talk about \nthe filibuster, and so on, as if it has never been done before, \ncolleagues of mine who have been around for a while may remember Abe \nFortas who was nominated for Chief Justice back in 1968. I will not \ntell you where I was in 1968, but it is a little before my time here. \nBut it is interesting to note that one of the Senators who filibustered \nthe Justice at that time, in 1968, was a Michigan Republican Senator, \nSenator Robert Griffin.\n  What is particularly noteworthy is that he is the father of one of \nthe nominees to the Sixth Circuit who, in fact, we just tried to move \nforward right now and were stopped in so doing. But it is important to \nnote that Senator Griffin, on the floor, in his debate, in his speech \nabout why it is appropriate for Senators to be able to stand up and \nobject and to filibuster on judiciary nominations, said:\n\n       It is important to realize that it has not been unusual--\n\n  This is 1968.\n\n     it has not been unusual for the Senate to indicate its lack \n     of approval for a nomination by just making sure that it \n     never came to a vote on the merits. And as I said before, 21 \n     nominations to the court have failed to win Senate approval.\n\n  This is Senator Griffin in 1968:\n\n       But only nine of that number have been rejected on a direct \n     up-or-down vote.\n\n  In other words, Senator Griffin acknowledged, back in 1968, that it \nwas not unusual for this Senate to filibuster judicial nominees. I \nthink there is a lesson here. If the Republicans are currently \nconcerned about filibusters, they should listen to what the father of \none of the pending nominees, a Republican, said about filibusters and \nchecks and balances.\n  Once again, the reality is, I do not believe this is about \nfilibusters in the context of judges because, look: 208 to 10; 208 \napproved, on a bipartisan basis, to 10. This is about whether we will \nhave free speech in the Senate and, I believe, in our country through \nits elected Senators. This is about whether there will be checks and \nbalances in our Government that allow those rare occasions--with \nthe 10--for people to say: No. You have gone too far, Mr. President. \nWith all due respect, your nominations have gone too far. And on behalf \nof the people we represent, we have the responsibility to stand up and \nsay, stop, send us another nominee. Send us someone in the mainstream. \nSend us someone who will, in fact, represent the interests of a \nmajority of Americans.\n\n  That is not what is happening today. We are being told: It is all or \nnothing. In the Sixth Circuit it is all or nothing. Three out of four \njudges is not good enough. We are being told here: It is all or \nnothing. It is about complete and absolute power, no checks and \nbalances. In other countries they call that a dictatorship. We have a \ndemocracy. We respect and allow other views to be heard. We do not have \nto agree with them, but we allow them to be heard in our country's \ndemocracy. And we create a way, through the Senate, to force people to \ncome together and listen to each other, and to be able to compromise in \nthe very best sense of the\n\n[[Page S5466]]\n\nword so we can create decisions, whether it be nominations for judges, \nor whether it be other decisions that affect the families we represent, \nin a way that has balance and common sense.\n  That is what we are talking about. We are talking about the ability \nto fight for your State, the ability to stand up for your values and \nprinciples, to fight for what you believe is right, the ability to ask \nothers to join you in that, the ability to say to the President of the \nUnited States: Ninety-five percent is a great record. Two hundred eight \nis a great record. But, Mr. President, these 10 go too far. These 10 \nwill turn us back in terms of protecting the rights of Americans, and \nwe are asking you to work with us on these 10.\n  That is not an unreasonable request. Fundamentally, what we are \ntalking about is whether we are going to continue to value free speech \nin our country. Doing away with the ability for us to speak and to be \nable to require a majority vote of 60 votes in order to be able to move \nforward on controversial issues is the first step of taking away free \nspeech. I am very hopeful when the vote comes that men and women of \ndignity and respect and good conscience on both sides of the aisle will \nsay, no, this is not about party. It should not be about party. It \nshould be about what is best for the country. It should be about \nprotecting the greatest Constitution in the world, the greatest Bill of \nRights in the world.\n  We have men and women of good conscience on both sides of the aisle \nwho I know want to do what is right. I hope it is going to be a very \nproud day, if this comes to a vote, and we have the bipartisan support \nof folks standing together and saying: We can do better than this. We \ncan work together and maintain the ability for the minority view to be \nheard in the Senate on behalf of the people of this country.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and our side for the time \nto speak on this issue.\n  This is an issue and a moment in Senate history which, frankly, I \nwished there could have been found a way to have avoided. I have been \namong those who have said to my leader: You have a qualified yes for my \nsupport to try and negotiate. Those negotiations have apparently broken \ndown. So then it falls to each of us to study and to take as seriously \nas we can the weight and moment of this decision and how we should come \ndown on the issue of filibustering judges who have majority support.\n  I ran for the Senate because I value this body, appreciate its unique \nrole in the history of our Nation, and very much want to see it succeed \nin doing the people's business. So I have taken as seriously as I can \nthe decision I have made to be an unqualified supporter of what the \nmajority leader is attempting to do here.\n  When I ran for the Senate, I promised the people of Oregon that when \nit came to advising and consenting on judges, I would not have a litmus \ntest, that I would respect the results of elections, that I would \nevaluate nominees for their academic achievement, their judicial \ntemperament, for their personal integrity, and I would then vote on \nthat basis without regard to a cultural litmus test.\n  I tried to demonstrate that when President Clinton was living at 1600 \nPennsylvania Avenue, although I was not on the Judiciary Committee, I \nfollowed closely the deliberations of that committee under the \nleadership of Senator Hatch. There were a number of Democratic nominees \nthat I specifically advocated for and tried very hard to help in their \nconfirmation, and in the most part succeeded, even though their views \nwere different from mine on a range of issues. I remember, in \nparticular, the work of the committee on two controversial judges who \nwere, by every measure, on the left wing of the spectrum politically, \nJudge Berzon and Judge Paez.\n  I remember Senator Hatch got them out of the committee, and I \nremembered my promise to the people of Oregon. One of our colleagues \nbegan to filibuster against proceeding in violation of what had been a \ngentleman's agreement of 200 years and more; that is, you don't \nfilibuster judges when they clear the committee process and they come \nto a vote. So I voted in both instances to invoke cloture and then to \nconfirm their ascension to the appellate court. I remember hearing a \nlot of disgruntlement by conservatives in Oregon who felt very strongly \nthat they should be defeated.\n  But I do think elections have consequences. Presidents have rights \nand we have a role to play in advising and consenting. But I also feel \nthat when we use the Senate rules to essentially overturn the right of \na President and the result of an election, we do more than just \nviolence to the executive branch of Government. We do serious injury to \nthe judicial branch of Government. And we send a chilling effect into \njudges' chambers that they are going to then, in the future, be held to \na standard that is so politicized that the best and brightest of \nliberal and conservative minds need no longer apply for service in the \nFederal judiciary.\n  Reflecting upon what I did under President Clinton, I have tried to \nbe consistent in my advice and consent during the administration of \nGeorge W. Bush. I also have noted, in history and through my 10 years \nhere, that at the end of every Presidential term it is the common \npractice in the Senate to slow down the nomination process awaiting the \nresults of an election. This happened to President Carter, it happened \nto President Reagan, it happened to George Hubert Walker Bush, and to \nBill Clinton as well. But we are faced now with a new standard. The \nagreement of the Senate that has been around for 214 years was changed \nin the last Congress. The 108th Senate began to filibuster on the floor \njudges that had cleared committee, judges that had demonstrable \nmajority support. The question that faces us now is a clash of two \nprinciples: Do we accede to this new Senate rule that has the standard \nno longer of 51 votes but the standard of 60 votes or do we go back to \nthat standard by changing a Senate rule making explicit what had before \nbeen an understanding among colleagues?\n  I believe we are in a place now that we have to go back to the \nstandard that this Chamber has operated under for 214 years. I think to \ndo otherwise has a long-term impact that is negative for the third \nbranch of our Government, the judiciary.\n  As Senator Durbin, the assistant minority leader, would probably like \nto know, this is one Republican who does listen to him and I was \nlistening to him last night when he spoke about Priscilla Owen. I heard \nhis comments earlier when she had come up for confirmation in the 108th \nCongress, and among the many things held against her was her membership \nin the Federalist Society. The Federalist Society is something I have \nnever belonged to. When I was in law school, I did not know about it. \nBut it is an organization that believes apparently the judicial branch \nof Government should strictly construe the laws and be reluctant to get \ninto political questions, to leave the democratic processes working, \nand to strictly interpret their judgments from the black letter of the \nlaw. I do, however, remember when I was in law school that one \norganization was very active in recruiting, and that was the American \nCivil Liberties Union. That is an organization that believes it stands \nfor the protection of the Bill of Rights and believes that those who \nshould be on the court should expansively interpret those rights. As I \nunderstood the assistant Democratic leader, he was saying that Judge \nOwen's membership in the Federalist Society should disqualify her. \nWell, if that is now the standard--and, Mr. President, it will be the \nstandard if the new Senate rule is 60 votes--then I promise my friends \non the Democratic side that there will probably be more than 40 \nSenators on this side who in the future will hold ACLU membership \nagainst nominees.\n\n  I think that is a mistake. I think guilt by association, whatever you \nthink of these organizations, should not be disqualifying of nominees \nfrom the Federal bench. If the standard that he erects for Priscilla \nOwen had been in place when Ruth Bader Ginsburg was nominated to the \nCourt, she would not have been confirmed.\n  I have also noted with some interest, while it is never held up as a \nreligious test, great concern for nominees who are devout members of \ntheir religious faith, fearing that their beliefs and their faith would \naffect their judgment\n\n[[Page S5467]]\n\non the bench. Mr. President, I believe the Constitution is explicit in \nmaking clear that we do not have religious tests for public office. I \ndo not accuse any of my Democratic colleagues of religious bias, but I \ndo hear a fearful undertone, an undercurrent here that I think will bar \nthe door to judicial service to people of faith if we set or keep the \nstandard at 60.\n  Mr. President, I come to this place believing that the brightest of \nconservative and liberal thinkers best serve American justice and the \nevolution of American law rather than having a standard that says if \nyou are unwritten and unrevealed and unaffiliated, you have a chance, \nbut if you are a Member of a political organization, if you are \naffiliated with the Heritage Institute or the Brookings Institute or \nyou are a member of a religious faith, these standards will begin to \nerect barriers to service in public office. I think that is a very \ndangerous thing.\n  After my own law school experience, I had the privilege of serving as \nthe law clerk to the chief justice of the New Mexico Supreme Court, \nVern Payne. It was my observation in those chambers that the judges \nthat made the most difference for good in the administration of equal \nprotection and due process were those on the right and the left that \nhad clear feelings and a compassion that guided their decisions. I do \nthink we make a serious long-term mistake and do very real damage to \nAmerican law when we say only those in the middle can serve. But that \nis what the standard of 60 will mean in the future of American law if \nthat is now the rule of the Senate.\n  If you study the filibuster, you will find that this is a right that \nSenators have that has evolved out of a mistake in leaving out a Senate \nrule that originally governed this body. But unlimited debate became \nthe standard, and yet it also became the vehicle by which much of \nAmerica's business was left undone. Sometimes it was used to odious \nends, such as the denial of an African-American's civil rights. Long \nbefore I ever arrived here, colleagues of former days began to change, \nrefine, and limit the use of the filibuster. I have heard my colleagues \non the other side describe this right in terms which make it secular \nscripture or that this is in the Constitution. It is not in the \nConstitution. But it is an important right, I grant.\n  What the public is not hearing is that there are several calendars of \nbusiness that we take up. There is the Legislative Calendar. We are the \nlegislative branch. Then there is the Executive Calendar in which we \ntake up advice and consent on executive appointments both to the \nexecutive branch and to the judicial branch. When you get to the \nExecutive Calendar, you really do get to the checks and balances. And \nthe question is why was it for more than 200 years the gentleman's \nagreement was that you do not filibuster these nominees, you give them \nan up-or-down vote for so long? And the reason was simply because it \ndid have an impact upon other branches of Government.\n  No one here is proposing a limitation of filibusters on the \nlegislative calendar.\n  Nevertheless, in former years, our colleagues made many modifications \nto the filibuster rule. It began in 1917. There was no limit to \nfilibusters until then. The standard was then set at 67 votes to invoke \ncloture, end debate, and go to a vote. But still, this was not a \nstandard applied to the Executive Calendar.\n  Further on, many changes have been made to the filibuster rights of a \nSenator. There are, in fact, 26 laws on our books today abrogating the \nright of a Senator to filibuster. For example, you cannot filibuster a \nFederal budget resolution. It was known as the Congressional Budget and \nImpoundment Control Act of 1974. The Budget Act of 1974 restricts \ndebate on a budget resolution and all amendments thereto and debatable \nmotions and appeals in connection therewith to not more than 50 hours. \nThat is a very significant restriction on the right of a Senator to \nfilibuster.\n  Another restriction is that you cannot filibuster a reconciliation \nbill. Like the budget amendment, a reconciliation bill cannot be \nfilibustered on the Senate floor, so it can pass by a majority vote. So \nyou cannot filibuster anything connected with a resolution or \nreconciliation, such as an amendment or a conference report.\n  I think the public would be surprised to know that at the end of a \nsession, when the work of the Finance Committee and much of the work of \nthe Appropriations Committee comes to this floor, usually in a big \nomnibus bill or reconciliation package, it passes by a majority vote \nbecause it cannot be filibustered. In fact, I suspect half of the work \nwe end up doing here, because of decisions made in former days, is not \nthe subject of filibuster, even though it is part of the legislative \ncalendar.\n  Another instance: You cannot filibuster a resolution authorizing the \nuse of force--the War Powers Resolution. You cannot filibuster \ninternational trade agreements, and that is called the Bipartisan Trade \nPromotion Authority. You cannot filibuster legislation under the \nNuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982.\n  Time and again, our colleagues before have recognized that to move \nthe business of the United States, there had to be some kind of limits. \nWhen I speak of the filibuster, I speak of it respectfully; I also \nunderstand its importance to slow down debate and to give Senators all \nthe opportunity they need for debate. But I also understand that the \ncountry's business has to move forward. So colleagues, in former \ndecades, have narrowed the right of the filibuster.\n  One of the Senators in this Chamber who preceded me here from Oregon \nis a man much esteemed in Oregon lore. His name was Wayne Morse, known \nas the ``tiger of the Senate.'' He is the third place recordholder for \na filibuster, exceeded only by Strom Thurmond and Al D'Amato. As I \nrecollect, he spoke for 22 hours and 26 minutes on the tidelands oil \nbill in 1953. I suspect, if you check the record, few Senators used the \nfilibuster more than Wayne Morse. He used to come here late at night \nand speak well into the night almost on a daily basis when the Senate \nwas in session.\n  But listen to what Wayne Morse said about the filibuster:\n\n       It is time we got back to the original purpose of the \n     Founding Fathers and of the U.S. Senate. That purpose is to \n     give reflection, continuity, and dispassion to legislation. \n     These certainly do not extend to giving a veto power to a \n     dissident minority. The Constitution is clear about when a \n     two-thirds vote is required to make a decision. Those who \n     want to add to those instances might better be honest about \n     their intentions and come forward with a constitutional \n     amendment, rather than to seek to achieve their purpose by \n     the means of Senate rules.\n\n  What Senator Morse was referring to is that the U.S. Constitution \nmakes explicit those instances in which supermajorities are required. \nAdvising and consenting on judges is not among those. It is required \nfor amending the Constitution, it is required to override a President's \nveto, it is required for the ratification of treaties, and in a couple \nmore instances. But this issue is not among those expressed in the \nConstitution.\n  To clarify, Senator Morse states that he supports the use of \nfilibusters. He said:\n\n       I am one liberal who admits that he filibusters.\n\n  Yet he draws a distinction between filibusters which control debate \nand a filibuster designed to prevent a vote from ever occurring, which \nsubjects the Senate to rule by the minority.\n  He went on to say:\n\n       It is one thing to filibuster to stop what is called a \n     ``steamroller'' in the Senate, to stop a majority from taking \n     advantage of a parliamentary minority. It is quite another \n     thing to filibuster in the Senate under a program which is \n     aimed to defeat the right of the majority to express itself \n     by way of the passage of legislation, which in turn will be \n     subject to the checks which our constitutional system \n     provides.\n\n  There are lots of checks and balances, but right now the 109th Senate \nhas a decision to make--whether or not we should reinstate a two-\ncentury tradition of voting up or down on the Executive Calendar for \njudges. Why? Because it is important to the two other branches of \nGovernment. The 108th Congress broke this tradition and 60 is now the \nrule, unless we come to some other agreement.\n  Well, again, Mr. President, I do fear the impact of this new standard \nif we don't do something. I believe this new standard, if applied to \npast distinguished jurists, would make their confirmation impossible. I \nbelieve Oliver Wendell Holmes was revolutionary in\n\n[[Page S5468]]\n\nhis thinking about law. Felix Frankfurter, a Roosevelt appointee, was \ncertainly revolutionary in his thinking. Thurgood Marshall or William \nRehnquist or Justice Scalia--these men, I believe, today, under this \nnew 60-vote standard, would likely be unconfirmable.\n\n  I believe this dumbs down American law, and the Senate does a \ndisservice to the meaning of elections and to the important authorities \ngiven to the executive and the judicial branches when we raise \nfilibusters to this new level, which I believe says to every bright \nyoung law student: If you have a point of view that is clear, if you \nhave a membership in the ACLU or in the Federalist Society, if you are \na member of a religious faith or part of a labor union, this will be \nheld against you; it will have a chilling effect on people's ability to \nmake a difference in law. It will certainly be a sword that we will \nwield when we are in the minority. It is, therefore, with regret but \nconviction that I assert my support for a rule that will restore the \ntradition of the Senate on the Executive Calendar.\n  The Senate rules are not Scripture. They have been changed repeatedly \nthroughout the history of this institution. We may now have to do that \nagain. I had hoped that a compromise could be found. One may yet be \nfound. But I have also come to believe that when you take a deal that \nsays give up on the principle, the tradition, and throw half of these \nnominees overboard, what is admitted in that offer is that all of these \npeople from whom we can select are qualified for the Federal bench, and \nwhat is also admitted by that offer is that this is just about \npolitics.\n  This is a principle too important to get in the way of the efficient \nmanagement of our business, our responsibility of advising and \nconsenting, and having back in place the 200-year tradition of giving \nup-or-down votes to those who have majority support.\n  With that, I urge my colleagues to support the majority leader, and I \nurge the restoration of a majority vote on judges.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham). The assistant majority leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I want to say this to my good friend \nfrom Oregon before he leaves the floor. I listened intently to his \nextremely well-crafted and reasoned arguments, and I congratulate him \nfor his important contribution to this momentous, significant debate we \nare having in the Senate, trying to get ourselves back to the way we \ncomfortably operated for 214 years. I thank my colleague for his \ncontribution.\n  Because of the unprecedented obstruction of our Democratic \ncolleagues, the Republican conference intends to restore the principle \nthat, regardless of party, any President's judicial nominees, after \nfull debate, deserve a simple up-or-down vote.\n  I know that some of our colleagues wish that restoration of this \nprinciple were not required. But it is a measured step that my friends \non the other side of the aisle have unfortunately made necessary. For \nthe first time in 214 years, they have changed the Senate's ``advise \nand consent'' responsibilities to ``advise and obstruct.''\n  Our Democratic friends did not bring us here by accident. For 4 \nyears, they have steered the Senate toward this unfortunate path. In \nApril of 2001, Senate Democrats held a private weekend retreat in \nFarmington, PA, to hatch a plan of attack against the President's \njudicial nominees. According to the New York Times, one participant at \nthe meeting said, quote, ``it was important for the Senate to change \nthe ground rules, and there was no obligation to confirm someone just \nbecause they are scholarly or erudite.'' And, thus, we embarked on this \nuncharted course.\n  Until the last Congress--the 108th Congress--it had been standard \nprocedure not to filibuster judicial nominees. That changed on February \n11, 2003. On that day, Senator Hatch, chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, sought consent to consider Miguel Estrada's nomination to \nthe DC Circuit Court. My friend, Senator Dodd, refused. Senator Hatch \noffered to increase the amount of time for debate by 10 hours and was \nrefused again. He offered 20 hours. He offered 40 hours. He offered \neven 50 hours of debate, an unprecedented amount of time. Senator Dodd \nsaid as follows:\n\n       This is not about the amount of time.\n\n  We have heard the repeated argument on the other side that this is \nabout the right to speak. Senator Dodd said that this is not about the \namount of time.\n  Remember that, Mr. President. The next time you hear any one of our \nDemocratic colleagues complain that when we restore the norms and \ntraditions of the Senate, we will be limiting their right to speak or \ncutting off debate, they themselves say it is not about that. Such \nclaims actually don't withstand scrutiny. I could not agree more with \nmy friend from Connecticut when he said this current impasse is not \nabout the amount of time available to debate.\n  The Democratic leader, my friend, Senator Reid from Nevada, also \nagrees with me. When Senator Bennett requested an agreement to consider \nthe nomination of Justice Priscilla Owen to the Fifth Circuit, Senator \nBennett also bent over backward to give the minority whatever number of \nhours for debate it needed.\n  Senator Reid responded:\n\n       There is not a number in the universe that would be \n     sufficient.\n\n  ``There is not a number in the universe that would be sufficient.'' \nClearly, it must not have been about getting enough time. Our \nDemocratic friends went on to block several more reasonable requests to \nconsider circuit court nominations.\n  So it is clear the Democrats do not want more time to debate. The \nminority leader indicated there was not enough time in the universe for \nthat. Rather, a minority of Senators are rejecting the opportunity to \ndebate because they want to kill qualified judicial nominations with \nclear majority support.\n  These nomination have gone for 2, 3, even 4 years--the current \njustice pending on the calendar has been up for 4 years--without a \nvote, while vacancies on the Federal bench pile up.\n  Let's take, for example, Justice Priscilla Owen, who is the pending \nbusiness of the Senate. She was nominated, as I just indicated, by the \nPresident 4 years ago to sit on the Fifth Circuit. Justice Owen has \nserved with honor for 10 years on the Texas Supreme Court. She won \nreelection with a whopping 84 percent of the vote, far more than most \nof our colleagues who oppose her. She has the support of both Democrats \nand Republicans from Texas who know her best. She has endured 4 years \nof slanderous attacks from partisan groups with grace and poise.\n  All of that meant nothing once she landed in the crosshairs of the \nSenate's obstructionist minority. We devoted 17 legislative days to \ndiscuss her qualifications--17 days--and we have held four cloture \nvotes on Justice Owen's nomination in order to allow the entire Senate \nto pronounce its collective judgment on her qualifications. But a \nminority of Senators is determined to deny the Senate the exercise of \nits constitutional duty. All four cloture votes have failed.\n  On May 1, 2003, cloture failed on the Owen nomination by a vote of 52 \nto 44. One week later, it failed 52 to 45. On July 29 of that year, it \nfailed 53 to 43, and on November 14 of that year, it failed 53 to 42. \nFor every one of those votes, Justice Owen had a clear majority and, in \nfact, bipartisan support. But some continued to do the unthinkable. \nThey continued to set the precedent that only 41 Senators should have \nthe right to dictate to the President who he or she can and cannot \nappoint to our Federal courts.\n  Justice Owen is not the only person they have obstructed. In the \n108th Congress, an obstructionist minority blocked the Senate from \ngiving its advice and consent a record 20 times. Twenty votes on \njudicial nominees were held, and 20 times a minority of Senators \nrefused to let the Senate discharge its constitutional duty to render \nadvice and consent. Twenty times, Mr. President, in the 108th Congress \nthey stopped a judicial nominee who clearly had majority bipartisan \nsupport from receiving the courtesy of an up-or-down vote. They \nfilibustered 10 different circuit court nominees within 16 months. This \nis completely without precedent, and it is also not fair. Any \nPresident's judicial nominees should receive careful consideration,\n\n[[Page S5469]]\n\nbut after that debate, they deserve a simple up-or-down vote.\n  Despite the Democrats' power grab, we offered them several \ncompromises that allowed for extended debate but still give nominees \nthe courtesy of an up-or-down vote. They rejected every one. For \ninstance, in May 2003, the majority leader, along with Senator Zell \nMiller of Georgia, a Democrat, proposed S. Res. 138, the Frist-Miller \ncloture reform proposal.\n  The Frist-Miller proposal was narrowly tailored after a much broader \nDemocratic proposal from 10 years ago that would have completely \neliminated the filibuster in its entirety. The Democratic proposal \nwould have eliminated the filibuster from legislation, to which it has \nbeen historically confined, as well as for judicial nominations, where \nit had not been used until the last Congress.\n  Interestingly, all Republicans, every single one, voted against the \nDemocratic proposal because it would have eliminated the legislative \nfilibuster. In fact, it was the first vote that Majority Leader Frist \ncast in the Senate. The only Senators who voted for that proposal were \nour friends on the other side of the aisle, nine of whom are still \nserving in this body today, singing a different tune, I might add.\n  I have heard several of my friends on the other side of the aisle \nwarn ominously that if the Senate votes to reestablish the norms and \ntraditions of this body with respect to judicial nominations, this \ncould somehow lead to the infringement or even abolishment of a \nfilibuster as applied to legislation. What nonsense. That will not \nhappen because certainly nobody on this side is in favor of this, and I \ngather now nobody on the other side is in favor of it, even though nine \nof them were for it 10 years ago.\n  When the Democrats proposed to do away with the legislative \nfilibuster 10 years ago, nobody on this side of the aisle supported it, \nand I am confident nobody on this side of the aisle would support it \ntoday. What is remarkable about that is back in 1995 when our friends \non the other side were proposing eliminating the filibuster, it was \nright after our party came to the majority. We would have been a big \nwinner of that had it passed, but yet not a single one of us voted for \nit. What did we do? We exercised restraint.\n  So back to the Frist-Miller proposal which, as I said, was a narrowly \nfocused version of the Democratic--I stress ``Democratic''--bill to \neliminate the filibuster altogether. The Frist-Miller proposal was much \nmore moderate, much more measured. It would have applied only to \nnominations, not to legislation. It would have allowed Senators after \n12 hours of debate to file successive cloture motions with declining \nrequirements to achieve cloture. The final cloture threshold would be a \nmajority of Senators present and voting.\n  The Frist-Miller proposal would have allowed the minority sufficient \ntime for debate while reestablishing the Senate's 214-year history of \nallowing nominees with majority support to receive the courtesy of an \nup-or-down vote. It was a good proposal. Unfortunately, our Democratic \ncolleagues rejected it.\n  In April 2004, a little over a year ago, the majority again reached \nout to our Democratic colleagues. We suggested another approach to \nbreak this impasse on judicial nominations. This time the chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee, Senator Specter, took the lead by offering S. \nRes. 327, the Specter protocol. Under the Specter protocol, judicial \nnominees would receive a committee hearing, a committee vote, and a \nfloor vote within a reasonable amount of time regardless of which party \ncontrolled the Senate and the White House.\n  The chairman of the Judiciary Committee would agree to hold hearings \nfor the nominees within 30 days of the submission of their names by the \nPresident. The chairman would set a date for the full committee to vote \nwithin 30 days of those hearings. And the majority leader would set an \nup-or-down vote on the Senate floor within 30 days after the nominee \nwas reported out of committee. It was pretty simple.\n  As I indicated, these timetables would apply whether Democrats or \nRepublicans were in charge of the Senate, whether the same party \ncontrolled the White House and the Senate, or whether the two parties \nsplit the control.\n  I bet to the vast majority of people listening, that sounds like an \nextremely fair, bipartisan solution. I agree with them. Again, \nunfortunately, our Democratic friends have not embraced it.\n  At this point, most people would throw up their hands and give up. We \ndo not have the luxury of doing that, however, because the American \npeople elected all of us to act on these issues that confront the \ncountry. Restoring Senate tradition and thereby restoring the proper \nbalance of power between the executive and legislative branches is one \nof our responsibilities, and we need to do it.\n  We Republicans redoubled our efforts and patiently tried again. In \nthe interim, though, we had an election. President Bush and several \ncandidates for the Senate, many of whom serve here today, met thousands \nof mainstream ordinary Americans who were angry at the obstructive \nattempts to disfigure the filibuster. Thousands of Americans told \nPresident Bush and their Republican candidates for the Senate that they \ndo not believe the President's nominees are out of the mainstream, and \nthey do not like a minority of the Senate preventing the Senate from \ndischarging its constitutional duty.\n  Millions of them turned out to reelect President Bush, giving him \nmore votes than any Presidential candidate in American history. And \nmillions voted to increase the majority's number in this body from 51 \nto 55.\n  Given those results, many of us had hoped that the politics of \nobstruction would have been dumped in the dustbin of history. \nRegretfully, that did not happen.\n  Recently, we Republicans tried again to reach an accommodation with \nour Democratic colleagues. Last month, the majority leader offered a \ncomprehensive, thoughtful, and fair-minded solution. It is called the \nfairness rule. My Democratic colleagues had repeatedly complained that \nsome of President Clinton's nominees were never reported out of the \nJudiciary Committee, and that is a valid point. They had a point. So to \naddress the concern, the Frist fairness rule guarantees that every \nnominee would be reported out of Judiciary--presumably some of them \nmaybe not with majority support--preventing any nominee from getting \nblocked in committee, which is the principal complaint the Democrats \nhave about how they had been treated when our party controlled the \nSenate and their party the White House.\n  The Frist fairness rule guarantees every nominee would be reported \nout of Judiciary, preventing any nominee from getting blocked in \ncommittee. The principal complaint we have heard repeated so often out \nhere is that the Republicans were simply doing in committee under \nClinton what the Democrats are doing on the floor under Bush. We will \ndeal with that.\n\n  In addition, my Democratic colleagues complain they need to have the \nright to debate judicial nominees protected.\n  This complaint is incongruous with Senator Reid's comment that there \nwas not enough debate time ``in the universe'' to allow a vote on \nJustice Priscilla Owen. It must not have been about time because he \nsaid there was not enough time in the universe.\n  Nevertheless, the Frist fairness rule guarantees up to 100 hours of \ndebate on every nominee, allowing every member to have his or her say. \nThis is more time than has been devoted to most Supreme Court nominees.\n  Finally, the Frist fairness rule guarantees up-or-down votes for \nevery circuit court or Supreme Court nomination, regardless of which \nparty controls the Senate or the White House. So the fairness rule \ncould not have a more appropriate name. It guarantees a full and \ncomprehensive debate. It guarantees every Senator a constitutional \nright to cast a fair up-or-down vote for every judicial nominee. It \nguarantees every President that their judicial nominees will get \nthrough committee and get a vote on the Senate floor and, of course, it \nwould not apply to legislation at all.\n  Once again, our Democratic colleagues quickly rejected this proposal.\n  To recap, the majority in the Senate has had weeks of debate. We have \ntried multiple and generous time agreements. We have offered the Frist-\nMiller proposal. We have suggested the Specter protocols. We have \noffered the Frist\n\n[[Page S5470]]\n\nfairness rule. Unfortunately, our Democratic colleagues have rejected \nall of these efforts at accommodation.\n  We have reached the point in this debate where not a lot of new \nthings are being said, but not everybody has yet said it. But I want to \nmake a point that I believe has not been made by anyone today. For 70 \npercent of the 20th century, the same party controlled both the White \nHouse and the Senate. For 70 percent of the 20th century, the same \npeople running the White House were running the Senate. Most of the \ntime, the people in the minority in the Senate were people of my party. \nYet Republicans did not filibuster, for example, the judicial nominees \nof Franklin Delano Roosevelt, even though he appointed eight Justices \nto the Supreme Court and elevated another to Chief Justice.\n  More recently, the Republican minority did not filibuster the \njudicial nominees of Presidents Carter and Clinton because we were in \nthe minority for 2 years under President Clinton and all 4 years under \nPresident Carter, even though several of these nominees were extremely \ncontroversial and did not enjoy supermajority support.\n  To be fair, when Senator Byrd was the minority leader, he did not \nlead his Democratic caucus in the Senate to filibuster President \nReagan's judicial nominees either, and Senator Byrd should be commended \nfor that. That was an extraordinary act of statesmanship. He could have \ndone at the time he was in the minority when President Reagan was in \nthe White House what has been done in the previous Congress.\n  When Senator Byrd was minority leader, he did not lead his Democratic \nCaucus in the Senate to filibuster President Reagan's judicial \nnominees. Not until 2 years ago has a Senate minority ever decided to \nfilibuster a President's judicial nominations on a repeated partisan \nand systematic basis when they clearly enjoyed majority support.\n  To correct this abuse, the majority in the Senate is prepared to \nrestore the Senate's traditions and precedents to ensure that \nregardless of party, any President's judicial nominees, after full and \nfair debate, receive a simple up-or-down vote on the Senate floor. It \nis time to move away from advise and obstruct and get back to advise \nand consent.\n  The stakes are high. The Constitution of the United States is at \nstake. Article 2, section 2 clearly provides the President and the \nPresident alone nominates judges.\n  The Senate is merely empowered to give advice and consent, but our \nDemocratic colleagues want to change the rules. They want to \nreinterpret the Constitution to require a supermajority for \nconfirmation.\n  In effect, they would take away the power to nominate from the \nPresident and grant it to 41 Members of the Senate. In other words, \nthere would be the distinct possibility and in fact great likelihood, \nif this continues, that 41 Members of the Senate will dictate to the \nPresident of the United States who may be a member of the Supreme Court \nand other courts.\n  We have made every effort to reach out and compromise, but our \ncolleagues at least so far have refused. The only choice that remains \nis to hold a vote to reaffirm the traditions and precedents that have \nserved this body so well for the last 214 years. Let us vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank Senator McConnell for his comments \nand for his leadership in this area. In many respects, I would like to \npick up where he left off in the discussion of how did we reach this \npoint. How did the Senate come to where we are going to have to have \nhours, days, weeks of debate on highly qualified men, women, and \nminorities for the Federal judiciary?\n  Most of my colleagues in the Senate know over the years I have been a \nbeliever that we should get things done for the American people; that \nwe should have cooperation; that we should vote on these judges up or \ndown and move on; that we need to be working as we did earlier this \nweek to report a highway bill, to get energy legislation, to deal with \nthe very critical and difficult issue of immigration reform, pass \nappropriations bills, take up other critical issues for the future in \nour country, the creation of jobs, to promote the continued development \nin critical high-tech areas such as telecommunications. We have a lot \nof work to do and yet here we are, stalled out, in my opinion, \nunnecessarily.\n  I believe we should reach across the aisle and try to find \naccommodation. Whether one likes it, that is how the Senate was set up, \nthat is how we work, quite often by consensus. Over the years, when I \nserved in leadership positions, I was quite often criticized by my own \ncolleagues of being too willing to work with the other side to try to \nfind a way to get a result. Then Senator and Minority Leader Tom \nDaschle and I worked together a lot. At the same time I was being \ncriticized by some of my colleagues, he was being criticized by his \ncolleagues. It is called leadership. It is called dealing with the \nrules one has and finding a way to work together and move forward.\n  I have been working for 4 years to figure out what is going on and \nfind a solution that is acceptable to both sides of the aisle.\n  I worked with Senator Frist and Senator Zell Miller to get a bill out \nof the Rules Committee some 2 years ago that would set up a process \nthat would get us to a final vote on these nominees. The first vote \nwould be the required 60 and then the second vote 57 and so on down \nuntil eventually after about a month we would get a direct vote that I \nthink would have been fair. But, no, the Democrats would not accept \nthat.\n  So then this year I came back and I started to see if maybe I could \nwork across the aisle with Senators such as Senator Nelson, Senator \nPryor, and others to see if we could address some of the legitimate \nconcerns.\n  This problem did not start 2 years ago or 4 years ago. This has been \ncoming for a long time. I think it began with the nomination of Judge \nBork. I think Republicans have retaliated for what they felt was a \nwrong and then the Democrats retaliated, but always slipping further \ndown this slope of unfairness to these good men and women.\n  So Senator Nelson and I worked together, and we did come up with a \nproposal that would guarantee all nominees now and in the future would \nget reported out of the Judiciary Committee after a specified period of \ntime. In other words, stop the practice, if in fact there was one \nduring the Clinton years, of killing nominations in the Judiciary \nCommittee unless there is clearly justification for it, objection from \nthe in-State Senators, or other reasons, but do not get into the \ntechnicalities. Just say we were going to guarantee they would get out \nof committee, there would be time for full debate up to a week before \nwe could get an up-or-down vote.\n  Senator Frist actually expanded that and said how about a full 100 \nhours of debate; every Senator would have an opportunity to talk an \nhour about any nominee. By the way, I can tell my colleagues, for the \nmajority leader to make a sacrifice of 100 hours of this body's time is \na huge sacrifice. It could not be done very much, maybe two or three \ntimes a year at the most. So the seven nominees now being held hostage \nwhom we are going to talk about in the next few days, some of them \nclearly would not make it under that procedure, but it would have \ngotten to a final vote.\n\n  Again, that was rejected by the Democrats because they said, oh, no, \nwe cannot agree to anything that would appear to or in fact give up our \nright to filibuster these judges. That did not work.\n  Then, of course, there was the last effort, one that is now still \nunderway, one I am not involved in any longer because I kept feeling we \nwere not going to get an agreement that did not force us to throw over \nand not even vote or agree to vote down one of these two women, \noutstanding nominees, for the Federal appellate courts. I will talk \nmore about them individually in a moment.\n  So again back to the question of how we got here, the debate we find \nourselves currently engaged in is a culmination of 4 years of \nobstructionism by a minority of Senators who refuse to allow the \nmajority of the Senate to fulfill their constitutional \nresponsibilities.\n  I know we have a lot of people who come to the Senate floor and talk\n\n[[Page S5471]]\n\nabout the Constitution, pontificate about the forefathers, and that the \nlanguage is this. I have read the Constitution, I have read the \nFederalist Papers, I have looked at the history, and clearly these \njudges should be getting an up-or-down vote.\n  The Constitution clearly says when they expect a supermajority, and \nif they do not, then the presumption is a majority would win.\n  I believe in protecting minority rights. I have been in the minority \nmore in my legislative career of 33 years than I have been in the \nmajority. But there is another little thing: It is called elections and \na majority. At some point, we quit talking and we give these people a \nfair up-or-down vote.\n  Some people will come to the floor and say, this is the tradition, we \nmust not mess with it; this is something that has been in existence \nfrom the very beginning of the history of our country. That is not so. \nAs a matter of fact, filibusters did not get started until World War I.\n  Oh, people will be surprised at that. You mean we have not had it \nsince the great days of Clay, Webster, and Calhoun? No. As a matter of \nfact, after a minority of Senators blocked efforts to have an up-or-\ndown vote on a proposal to arm merchant ships during World War I, the \nSenate adopted its first cloture rule. The cloture rule was later \nchanged on five separate occasions, most recently in 1986.\n  So these great and hallowed traditions in this institution, if one \nchecks back on them, do not go back very far. This is a living body. \nLike the Constitution, it is a living, breathing body. It changes. It \nevolves. We make changes in the rules. That is why when people say, woe \nis me, doom and gloom, the Senate cannot get through this, whatever we \ndo, it will be cataclysmic--forget it. We have a job to do here. Let us \nface it like men and women and let us deal with the issue. Let us move \non. Let us deal with the substance. Let us deal with the things that \nmatter to people, such as the price of gasoline and the immigration \nproblem, and handle it in a fair way. But this is not something that \nhas been written into the Constitution. No, it is new.\n  It began, I am sorry to say, with a personal friend of mine, a great \nman, a great judge named Charles Pickering who had been approved \nunanimously by the Senate in the past to be a Federal district judge, \nbut when he was nominated for the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, we \ncould not get it out of the committee. At that time, the majority, the \nDemocrats, killed his nomination in committee. I was floored. I could \nnot believe it; one of the finest men, one of the finest Christians, \none of the finest judges, one of the best unifiers we have ever had in \nthe history of our country probably since LQC Lamar in the 1880s.\n  He got defeated in committee. I thought at the time it was a shot at \nme, part of the politics we get around here, and that it would change \nwith time; it was just a gratuitous backhand at me. I can say for sure \nSenator Daschle, my friend, was not comfortable with what happened \nthere. The majority came back to the Republican side and Judge \nPickering came to the floor and he was filibustered. Then it was Miguel \nEstrada. Then it was Priscilla Owen. Then a pattern developed. That is \none reason some people say, look, if there is this option that it only \ntakes 51 votes, why was it not done last year or 2 years ago or 4 years \nago? Frankly, because I thought it was an aberration. I thought it was \ntemporary.\n  I could not believe this institution would besmirch, denigrate, and \nharass these nominees, turning the Senate not into an august, hallowed \nbody of great deliberation but into a torture chamber, and yet here we \nare. I have tried to find a way to get out of this. I have tried to \naccept some of the blame I deserve, but that has already been done.\n  We have to find a solution now and we have to do it soon. Can a \ncompromise be worked out? Why, of course. They always can, by sundown. \nThat would probably satisfy nobody totally, but everybody a little bit. \nIf it does not happen, we have to get this over with. We have to vote.\n  So what I thought was going to be an isolated incident now has become \nextreme. It has become systematic. It has become highly partisan. We \nhave to deal with it. We probably should have already dealt with it.\n  As majority leader, I worked closely with Senator Daschle to ensure \neach nominee who reached the Senate floor received an up-or-down vote. \nSome people said, all the judges did not get out of committee. The \nleaders do not dictate to the committees. We do not dictate to one \nSenator, let alone a committee of Senators. But when it came to the \nfloor, through thick or thin and however difficult it was, we got it \ndone, we got them confirmed.\n\n  I will give an example. I filed cloture personally on President \nClinton's nominee to the Federal district court in Utah, Brian Theodore \nStewart. A cloture vote was in fact held to cut off an unnecessary and \nunfair filibuster on September 21, 1999. I voted for cloture to cut off \nthe filibuster for this nominee because I believed, as I believe now, \nthat it was important to hold an up-or-down vote on a nomination after \nit reached the Senate floor.\n  Additionally, I would like to mention two other controversial \nnominees to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals nominated by President \nClinton. Marsha Berzon and Richard Paez both had very serious problems \nthat were raised during their nominations and that concerned Senators. \nTheir nominations were certainly highly contentious, and the process \nwas very slow. However, they did eventually come out of the Judiciary \nCommittee and at the appropriate time I rose to file for cloture on \nboth of these nominees in an effort to move the process forward toward \na vote, against the wishes of a number of Members of my own caucus. I \nstood right there and said we are not going to filibuster Federal \njudicial nominees; we are not going to do it. If they come out of the \ncommittee, they are going to get an up-or-down vote. Now, I may vote \nagainst them but not on my watch are Republicans going to filibuster \nthese nominees.\n  On March 8, 2000, the Senate voted 86 to 13 to 1 to invoke cloture to \ncut off the filibuster on the nomination of Judge Berzon. Her \nnomination was confirmed the following day by a vote of 64 to 34 to 2.\n  Also on March 8, 2000, the Senate voted 85 to 14 to 1 to invoke \ncloture on the nomination of Richard Paez. The next day, March 9, 2000, \na motion to postpone indefinitely a vote on Paez was defeated 67 to 31 \nto 2. By the way, in the interest of full disclosure, I voted to delay \nit. I do not remember why, and I am embarrassed. I should not have. An \nindefinite postponement is the same as a filibuster. That was wrong. We \nshould not have done it. He was later approved that very day 59 to 39 \nto 2.\n  These two now serve in the Federal judiciary. They had lots of \nproblems, in my mind, which I will not enumerate. There is no use \nrehashing that. But this is proof of the evidence when Republicans say \nwe did not do it when we could have during the Clinton years, we did \nnot allow filibusters. The number of President Clinton's judges who \nwere blocked by filibusters, zero. Not under my watch or others'.\n\n  I think it is time we bring this to conclusion. I think if we could \never get a time out, if we could ever find a way to stop the \nfilibusters, deal with the magnificent seven that are still pending, \nthis would fade away. That is the way it happens in the Senate.\n  Oh, the clash is mighty and the roar is deafening. ``There is no way \nout of this valley of death.'' That is when it always seems to happen, \nthat we find a way to stop the craziness and move forward in a \nresponsible way.\n  I have to talk a little bit about the nominees. I have met with some \nof them. I direct your attention to this picture. Why does he have a \npicture? I want to make a point. These are not numbers. These are not \nseven things. These seven nominees who have been renominated by the \nPresident are men and women and minorities who have had their \nreputations and their lives dragged through the mud--this one, \nPriscilla Owen, for up to 4 years.\n  Maybe you could analyze the seven and say, that one has a little \nproblem or that one has a little problem. I don't say they are perfect. \nNone of us are. But I am telling you, you can't get much closer to \nperfect than this nominee, Priscilla Owen. That is why I could never \nagree to any deal that did anything but allow this lady to have an up-\nor-down vote on her nomination.\n\n[[Page S5472]]\n\nShe is from Texas. Maybe that is part of the problem, I don't know. She \nserves on the Texas Supreme Court. It seems like a good training ground \nbefore you move to the Federal judiciary. She graduated cum laude from \nBaylor University and cum laude from Baylor University Law School. She \nwas a member of the Baylor Law Review. She was honored as the Baylor \nYoung Lawyer of the Year, Baylor University Outstanding Young Alumna. \nAfter graduating from law school, she scored the highest score in the \nState when she took the Texas bar exam in 1977.\n  She practiced law with one of the most prestigious law firms in the \nState of Texas, mostly commercial litigation, for 17 years. She has \nbeen on the Supreme Court of Texas for 10\\1/2\\ years, and the last time \nshe ran she was endorsed by every major newspaper in the State and she \nreceived 84 percent of the vote.\n  She has ruled hundreds of times, not always on the business side, \nsometimes on the consumer side. She has had to interpret law that has \nbeen difficult, but she has done it. She has done it fairly. She has \ndone it most often with the majority of the court.\n  By the way, even that hallowed American Bar Association--that I used \nto be a member of, but I dropped my membership for a number of \nreasons--gave her its highest rating.\n  When you look at this lady's record, her brilliance, her family--\nevery way she has conducted herself, there is no justification for her \nnot being confirmed or at least getting a vote.\n  I am not going to go through the charges that are levied against her, \npartially because some of them are so bizarre and so ridiculous, but \nalso because I have seen around here that if you repeat a misstatement \noften enough, it becomes fact. Here is an example. Justice Owen has \nbeen accused by some of the people here because of the fact that \nJustice Alberto Gonzales--now the Attorney General, then a supreme \ncourt justice in Texas--accused her of being engaged in an \n``unconscionable act of judicial activism'' in one particular parental \nnotice case where abortion was involved and she was interpreting a \nState law. That happened even though Justice Gonzales said that was not \nthe case, that his words were twisted and misconstrued. When he said \nthat, for him, in his concurring opinion, it would be an \n``unconscionable act of judicial activism'' for any judge to bend the \nstatute to advance his or her own personal views, even though ``the \nramifications of such law and the results of the court's decision may \nbe personally troubling,'' he was talking about himself.\n  This is not a gratuitous shot at his colleague sitting on the bench, \nand he has tried to clarify it. It makes no difference. It continues to \nbe repeated as fact among those who oppose this nomination.\n  Look at this face. This lady has been through 4 years of hell. Why? I \njust don't get it.\n  Somebody said she has a pro-business voting record. Is that something \nsinister? She has ruled, for instance, that patients who are injured \nshould be able to pursue doctors. She has ruled on occasion for \nconsumers. But, my goodness, is it an indictment if you are pro-\nbusiness? I am the son of a shipyard pipefitter, union member, but I am \npro-business because I figured out, like my daddy knew, if business \ndidn't make a profit, if they went out of business, he was out of a \njob.\n  So, there, she deserves a vote up or down. She will make a great \nFederal judge.\n  This one is even more hard to explain to me. Janice Rogers Brown. I \nam not going to give her American dream story, but she has lived it: \nBorn in Alabama, family moved to Sacramento when she was still in \nelementary school. She grew up in California, got an education, and \nworked hard. She graduated from California State University at \nSacramento, with a bachelor in economics and received a law degree from \nUCLA Law School. She has served as Legal Affairs Secretary to Pete \nWilson, the Governor of the State of California, Deputy Attorney \nGeneral in the office of the California Attorney General, and she \nserved on an intermediate California appellate court. She has been on \nthe bench long enough where she has been appointed and sought \nreelection and she got 76 percent of the vote in California on \nreelection.\n  That is not exactly a center or a center right constituency. They \nmust have thought she was doing a good job; the first African-American \nwoman in history on the Supreme Court of California. A great record.\n  The American dream has been lived for this lady. Two days ago, when \nshe came by my office, I apologized to her on behalf of the American \npeople for the way the Senate has treated her. I am ashamed of what we \ndid. What is the criticism?\n\n  One of them, she is harsh on criminal defendants. Excuse me? The \ntruth is, she is a conservative African-American woman. This is bad. \n``How can we allow that to happen? That can't be.'' She has had some \nthings to say in her remarks off the bench, that some of the Federal \nprograms have had a counter-effect, not a positive effect. But she has \nbeen described by others as being brilliant and fair. Even a columnist \nwho was being critical of her recently admitted that her opinions are \nconsistently the most concise, engaging, well organized, and well \nreasoned.\n  She wrote the majority of the decisions in 2002 for the California \nSupreme Court. She is writing with the majority. Again, this face is a \nhuman being. This is not a number. This lady has been tangled up in \npartisan politics for 2 years. This is wrong.\n  That is why when people say to me, Oh, the institution will be \ndamaged, my colleagues, I think we maybe protest too much, and we puff \nourselves up a little bit too much. By the way, there are some things \nmore important than the rules of an institution. I still think right \nand wrong should apply, just as it should in every other phase of our \nlives.\n  What has happened to this lady, and this one, is wrong. I cannot be a \npart of a process that doesn't give them the vote that they deserve, up \nor down--now. If they are not confirmed, so be it. I have voted on the \nwinning side and on the losing side. I have voted for judges and \nagainst judges. Most often they have been confirmed; occasionally not, \nand I have been berated by Democrats sometimes when I voted against \nsome of the nominees. But the process used to work. It is broken now. \nLet's fix it. Let's fix it now. Let's do our job. Let's vote.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coburn). The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I think the facts are clear. You have heard \nthis many times. Almost everything has been said, but not everybody has \nsaid it. I want to go over some of the facts I think are very \nimportant.\n  For 214 years judicial nominations have come to the Senate floor and \nhave been considered without filibuster. It is a courtesy extended by \nmy fellow Senators to the President. By resorting to filibustering \njudicial nominees who have the support of a majority of Senators, which \nbegan in 2003 by colleagues on the other side of the aisle, they are \nthrowing overboard 214 years of Senate courtesy and tradition.\n  The Constitution of the United States does not contain a word about \nfilibusters. The Federalist Papers do not contain the word \n``filibuster.'' Rather, the Constitution lays out the standards for \nconfirming judges. It does not require a 60-vote majority for \nconfirmation. It requires a majority vote to confirm members of the \nFederal judiciary.\n  The Democrats in this Chamber have taken it upon themselves to \nrewrite the rules for confirming justices. They now demand 60 votes for \nconfirmation to a circuit court or potentially a Supreme Court \nposition.\n  For the first time, judicial nominations with clear majority support \nare denied an up-or-down 51-vote, Senate majority vote on the Senate \nfloor through the unprecedented use of the filibuster.\n  There is no constitutional authority for their demands, and it is an \nabandonment of the tradition of this Chamber. We are perfectly within \nour rights and history is on our side as we prepare to take steps to \nensure the confirmation of judges with majority support.\n\n  In an attempt to cloud these rather clear facts, the Democrats have \nput forward a parade of dubious arguments to support their filibusters, \nobfuscation to justify political obstructionism.\n  One of the facts they overlook is their obligation to check the \nPresident--and our very system of checks and balances gives them \nauthority and\n\n[[Page S5473]]\n\ndemands action. But the Senate has the ability to check the President, \nnot a minority of the Senate willing to pervert the rules of this body. \nThe majority, therefore the Senate as a body, and representing a \nseparate branch of Government, has spoken on these nominations. These \nnominees enjoy the support of the majority body's Members. The \nPresident has made his nominations and made his case for the \nnominations. Supporters and opponents of the nominees have made their \ncase before the Senate on these nominations. From the votes we have \ntaken we have seen that a majority of the Senate agrees with the \nPresident and supports his nominations. Under the system to check the \nPresident, as laid out clearly in the Constitution, the President has \ncarried the issue and won the support of the body that has the \nauthority to register its disapproval.\n  It has not disapproved. The Constitution says nothing on the subject \nof a filibuster, and it says nothing of the power of a minority to \ndefeat the President's judicial nominations. It is the product of a \nrule of the Senate passed many years after the ratification of the \nConstitution. This rule does not derive from the authority of the \nConstitution. Furthermore, the rule is being used in a manner never \nused before. It is a perversion of the intent of the Constitution and, \nif its use in this manner is not abandoned, then we must take steps to \nwipe it from the books.\n  Let me go back to statements made about this process. Democrats are \ntrying to change the constitutional standard for confirmation from a \nsimple majority to a 60-vote standard. That is why we see the claim of \nthe distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia that the \nnominations were rejected because they did not get 60 votes for cloture \nin the 108th Congress. Senators from Nevada, New York, Wisconsin, and \nMassachusetts have said they were rejected. A 60-vote standard is \ncontrary to the Constitution. The Constitution spells out clearly where \na supermajority is required: For veto overrides, constitutional \namendments, treaty ratification, expelling a Member, convictions for \nimpeachment. Judicial confirmation is not one of them.\n  It is also a double standard based on past treatment of a Democratic \nPresident's nominees. For example, Clinton nominees Richard Paez and \nSusan Molloway and William Fletcher were all confirmed with fewer than \n60 votes, as were Carter nominees Abner Mikva and L.T. Senter.\n  It is said that justice delayed is justice denied. These filibusters \nof judicial nominations have slowed the consideration of cases in the \nFederal appeals court, especially in the Sixth Circuit, where Democrats \nhave blocked four qualified nominees. As my colleague from Mississippi \nhas pointed out, these good people who have devoted their life to law \nand the judiciary have been subject to interminable delays, personal \nvilification, without giving them the right to an up-or-down vote which \nthis body has already demonstrated they would give them.\n  Look at what they have said. Back in 1975 in the Congressional Record \nof February 20:\n\n       The filibuster has been the shame of the Senate and the \n     last resort of special interest groups. Too often, it has \n     enabled a small minority of the Senate to prevent a strong \n     majority from working its will and serving the public \n     interest.\n\n  So spoke the senior Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Then, in 1998, June 18, a statement from the Congressional Record:\n\n       I have stated over and over again on this floor that I \n     would . . . object and fight against any filibuster on a \n     judge, whether it is somebody I opposed or supported.\n\n  That was the senior Senator from Vermont.\n  He also said:\n\n       I do not want to get [to] having to invoke cloture on \n     judicial nominations. I think it is a bad precedent.\n\n  Congressional Record, September 16, 1999.\n  Another quote:\n\n       If we want to vote against somebody, vote against them. I \n     respect that. State your reasons. I respect that. But don't \n     hold up a qualified judicial nominee . . . I have stated over \n     and over again on this floor that I would . . . object and \n     fight against any filibuster on a judge, whether it is \n     somebody I opposed or supported; that I felt the Senate \n     should do its duty.''\n\n  Same Senator from Vermont, June 18, 1998.\n  Here is another one from the Congressional Record March 19, 1997:\n\n       But I also respectfully suggest that everyone who is \n     nominated ought to have a shot, to have a hearing and have a \n     shot to be heard on the floor and have a vote on the floor . \n     . . It is totally appropriate for Republicans to reject every \n     single nominee if they want to. That is within their right. \n     But it is not, I will respectfully request, Madam President, \n     appropriate not to have hearings on them, not to bring them \n     to the floor and not to allow a vote . . .\n\n  That was the distinguished senior Senator from Delaware, March 19, \n1997.\n  Here is another good quote:\n\n       The Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court said: \n     ``The Senate is surely under no obligation to confirm any \n     particular nominee, but after the necessary time for inquiry \n     it should vote him up or vote him down.'' Which is exactly \n     what I would like.\n\n  The distinguished senior Senator from Massachusetts, Congressional \nRecord, March 7, 2000.\n  Mr. President, the minority had the opportunity to win their argument \nlong before it reached the Senate. They had a chance to win at the \nballot box. They argued that the American people could send Members of \nthe Senate who agreed with their legislative agenda and their view of \nthe role of the judiciary. The American people did not agree with the \nminority and sent an increased majority of Members to the Senate who \nagree with the President on the role of the judiciary, the type of \nindividuals who should occupy these positions, and the need to give \nthem an up-or-down vote.\n  On two occasions, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle had \nthe chance to win the argument on judicial nominations and had a chance \nto win this argument at the ballot box. They did not. They had a chance \nto convince a majority of the Members of the Senate that the nominees \nare unsuitable to sit on the Federal bench. They were unable to do so. \nSo they have resorted to turning a Senate rule on its head and \ninsisting on an application never used before to win a debate they \ncould not win by a simple 51-vote majority.\n  Now our Democratic colleagues come to the floor and say the view of \nthe majority of the Senate and the view of a President, who won the \nmost votes ever by any President, is out of the mainstream. A minority \nis now demanding their view--which is the minority opinion in this \nbody, and apparently from the opinion polls and our contacts, the \nminority opinion in the country--should carry the day as to what is and \nwhat is not in the mainstream. Once again, this line of thought would \nseem to turn logic on its head.\n  To cloud further the unprecedented nature of their attack on the \nPresident's nominations, my Democratic colleagues are blowing their own \nhorn about confirming 208 of the President's nominees versus only \ndefeating 10; a stellar record of cooperation they claim, evidenced by \nconfirming 95 percent of the President's nominees. By confirming the \nPresident's district court nominees they are attempting to hide a \nblatant attack on the President's nominees for higher court, appellate \ncourts, courts of appeal.\n  The circuit courts of appeals are the second most important courts in \nthe land behind only the Supreme Court of the United States. When it \ncomes to confirmation of the President's nominees, their record is not \none of cooperation but one of unprecedented assault. Nearly one in \nthree of President Bush's nominees for the Federal court of appeals has \nbeen targeted for defeat. This is not by accident. We know two days \nafter the Senator from Vermont switched parties and changed the balance \nof the Senate in June of 2001, a number of extreme left-leaning groups \nmet to plot the defeat of circuit court nominees. Their analysis showed \na Republican President would surely nominate judges with a philosophy \nconsistent with the President, strict construction of the Constitution, \nrather than the extreme leftwing judicial legislation views of their \nown. The left-leaning groups saw their balance on the court decreasing, \nand their plan was to defeat circuit court nominees. Their plan was not \nto argue for judges in the mainstream or to defeat district court \nnominees. Their objective was to defeat, by any means, circuit court \nnominees of President Bush.\n\n  Yesterday we saw this outline in the Washington Times. These groups, \nin\n\n[[Page S5474]]\n\nturn, met with Senate Democrats to target certain nominees. \nSurprisingly, the nominees the groups decided to target seemed to be \nneatly in line with those ultimately targeted by Senate Democrats. So, \nactually, the minority has been outsourcing their decision as to who is \nand who is not in the mainstream to outside liberal groups such as \nPeople for the American Way, which a glance at any of their material \nreveals they are not exactly in the mainstream.\n  Here are a couple of excerpts from the Washington Times article \nyesterday:\n\n       In a November 7, 2001, internal memo to Sen. Richard J. \n     Durbin, who is now the minority whip, an aide described a \n     meeting that the Illinois Democrats had missed between groups \n     opposed to Mr. Bush's nominations and Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, \n     Massachusetts Democrat and member of the Judiciary Committee.\n\n  The memo goes on to State:\n\n       Based on input from these groups, I would place the \n     appellate nominees in the categories below . . . listing 19 \n     nominees as ``good,'' ``bad'' or ``ugly.''\n       Four of the 10 nominees who Democrats have since \n     filibustered were deemed either ``bad'' or ``ugly.'' None of \n     those deemed ``good'' by the outside groups was filibustered.\n       Among those listed as ``ugly,'' was Texas Supreme Court \n     Justice Priscilla Owen, whose nomination will be brought to \n     the floor today by Majority Leader Bill Frist, Tennessee \n     Republican.\n       In a June 4, 2002, memo to Mr. Kennedy, staffers advised \n     him that Justice Owen would be ``our next big fight.''\n       ``We agree that she is the right choice--she has had a bad \n     record on labor, personal injury and choice issues, and a \n     broad range of national and local Texas groups are ready to \n     oppose her,'' the aides wrote.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent this be printed in the Record after my \nstatement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1)\n  Mr. BOND. As I believe has been stated many times before, Justice \nOwen has won overwhelming support, more than three-quarters support of \nthe majority of Texas and the endorsement of major leading newspapers, \nthe Bar Association, but the left-leaning groups did not like her.\n  Our colleagues in the minority want congratulations for the fact that \nnearly all of the President's trial court judges have been confirmed. I \nrespect greatly the men and women on the Federal district court. In the \neyes of the Senate Democrats, however, clearly, all judgeships are not \ncreated equal.\n  We see the contrast between the way the Democrats are conducting \nbusiness and the way business has been conducted by tradition. Nearly \none of three of the President's nominees to the appellate court, the \ncircuit court are being filibustered. Prior to the Democrats embarking \non this path, 2,372 nominees were confirmed without a filibuster; 377 \nof President Clinton's nominees were confirmed without a filibuster. \nJudges were confirmed for 214 years without there being a filibuster. \nSo the minority has turned over the determination as to who is and who \nis out of the mainstream to a number of out-of-the-mainstream groups, \nand they let these groups lead us down the path of destroying Senate \ntradition of 200 years. Not a record, in my view, that warrants a hardy \npat on the back.\n\n  In a thoughtful opinion piece in today's Washington Times, majority \nleader Bob Dole recalls there were a few nominations made by President \nClinton that were clearly objectionable to most Republicans. He said:\n\n       I recall two judicial nominations of President Clinton's \n     particularly troubling to me and my fellow Republicans \n     members when I was the Republican Leader in the Senate. \n     Despite our objections, both received an up-or-down vote on \n     the Senate floor. In fact, I voted to end debate on one of \n     these nominees while voting against his confirmation. \n     Republicans chose not to filibuster because it was considered \n     inappropriate for nominations to the federal bench.\n\n  Senator Dole goes on to say:\n\n       By creating a new 60-vote threshold for confirming judicial \n     nominees, today's Senate Democrats have abandoned more than \n     200 years of Senate tradition.\n       For the first time, judicial nominees with clear majority \n     support are denied an up-or-down vote on the Senate floor \n     through an unprecedented use of the filibuster. This is not a \n     misrepresentation of history; it's a fact.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that be printed in the Record after my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2)\n  Mr. BOND. We have heard a lot of statements and posturing from the \nother side about the President trying to pack the courts and how this \nis a nuclear option.\n  Let me tell you what the nuclear option is. The Democrats say if we \ngo back to the tradition of confirming judges by a 51-vote up-or-down \nmajority in the Senate, they are going to blow up the Senate. They are \ngoing to bring everything to a halt. They are going to destroy this \nbody because we insist on what Democrats, prior to 2001, agreed with \nus; that is, judicial nominations brought to the floor deserve to be \nconfirmed by a 51-vote up-or-down majority.\n  Already, we have seen the Democrats' stall tactics. ``Stall ball'' is \nbeing played. For people not in this body, you may not know that any \nSenator has a right to object to committee hearings being conducted 2 \nhours after the Senate goes in session. Even though this is regular \norder, this is standard procedure, we have had the Democratic side \nobject to holding hearings.\n  Yesterday, we were scheduled to have a very important meeting in our \nIntelligence Committee to go over current threats, the intelligence of \nthe dangers that our troops in the field face and the dangers we in the \nhomeland face. That meeting was canceled because the Democrats \nobjected.\n  The Energy Committee is trying to write a very important bill dealing \nwith energy. We have not had an energy policy in a decade and a half. \nGas prices have gone through the roof. We are seeing shortages. We are \npaying at the pump. We are paying in our home heating bills, paying \nwith jobs going overseas because of the unnatural, artificial \nrestrictions on the development of sources of energy in the United \nStates--natural gas, oil, and even renewable fuel--while demand \nartificially is being increased for natural gas by the requirement that \nrules require it be used in electric utilities. And yet by objecting to \ncommittee hearings, the Democrats are limiting the Energy Committee to \n2 hours a day and a markup.\n  It is not the President who is distorting rules to forward his \nnominations. It is not the President who has abandoned tradition and \ncourtesy in forwarding his nomination. It is not the President who is \nattempting to rewrite the Constitutional standard for confirming \njudges. The other side of the aisle thinks if they can muster 41 votes, \nthey ought to stop anybody that their leftwing, liberal interest groups \ntarget for blocking from confirmation. The President is exercising his \nconstitutional role to appoint members of the Federal judiciary, and he \nis doing so following his decisive victory last fall after winning more \nvotes than any other president in history, promising to appoint good, \nwell-qualified, highly qualified, highly respected judges and attorneys \nto the courts of appeal. Who is and who is not in the mainstream of \nAmerican thought?\n  I believe it is clear that the President and the majority in the \nSenate have a right to give these well-qualified nominees an up-or-down \n51-vote majority vote on the floor of the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the Washington Times, May 19, 2005]\n\n             Memos Reveal Strategy Behind Judge Filibusters\n\n                           (By Charles Hurt)\n\n       The ``nuclear'' showdown that is expected to begin \n     unfolding in the Senate today has its origins in closed-door \n     discussions more than three years ago between key Senate \n     Democrats and outside interest groups as they huddled to plot \n     strategies for blocking President Bush's judicial nominees.\n       In a Nov. 7, 2001, internal memo to Sen. Richard J. Durbin, \n     who is now the minority whip, an aide described a meeting \n     that the Illinois Democrat had missed between groups opposed \n     to Mr. Bush's nominees and Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, \n     Massachusetts Democrat and member of the Judiciary Committee.\n       ``Based on input from the groups, I would place the \n     appellate nominees in the categories below,'' the staffer \n     wrote, listing 19 nominees as ``good,'' ``bad'' or ``ugly.''\n       Four of the 10 nominees who Democrats have since \n     filibustered were deemed either ``bad'' or ``ugly.'' None of \n     those deemed ``good'' by the outside groups was filibustered.\n\n[[Page S5475]]\n\n       Among those listed as ``ugly'' was Texas Supreme Court \n     Justice Priscilla Owen, whose nomination will be brought to \n     the floor today by Majority Leader Bill Frist, Tennessee \n     Republican.\n       The internal Democratic memos, downloaded from Democratic \n     computer servers in the Judiciary Committee by Republican \n     staffers, offer a unique look into the early stages of the \n     filibuster campaign, when Democrats were clearly doubtful \n     that they could succeed in blocking any of the nominees.\n       In the 14 memos obtained in November 2003 by the Wall \n     Street Journal and The Washington Times, Democratic staffers \n     outlined the concerns held by outside groups about Justice \n     Owen's ``hostile'' position toward abortion and her ``pro-\n     business'' attitude.\n       In a June 4, 2002, memo to Mr. Kennedy, staffers advised \n     him that Justice Owen would be ``our next big fight.''\n       ``We agree that she is the right choice--she has a bad \n     record on labor, personal injury and choice issues, and a \n     broad range of national and local Texas groups are ready to \n     oppose her,'' the aides wrote.\n       Another nominee discussed often in the memos is Miguel \n     Estrada, a Washington lawyer who became the first \n     filibustered nominee and who withdrew his nomination to the \n     U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit after waiting two \n     years for a final vote.\n       In the 2001 memo to Mr. Durbin, the staffer explained the \n     concerns that the outside groups had about Mr. Estrada.\n       ``They also identified Miguel Estrada (D.C. Circuit) as \n     especially dangerous because he had a minimal paper trail, he \n     is Latino, and the White House seems to be grooming him for a \n     Supreme Court appointment,'' the aide wrote.\n       The memos also reveal the close relationship between \n     Democrats and the outside groups.\n       In a June 21, 2002, memo to Democrats Mr. Kennedy, Mr. \n     Durbin, Sen. Charles E. Schumer of New York and Sen. Maria \n     Cantwell of Washington, a staffer urged delaying a hearing \n     for Mr. Estrada to ``give the groups time to complete their \n     research and the committee time to collect additional \n     information.''\n       One nominee who wasn't filibustered was Judge Timothy \n     Tymkovich, who now sits on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \n     10th Circuit. But Democrats opposed moving him until all the \n     groups had given their approval.\n       ``[I]t appears that the groups are willing to let Tymkovich \n     go through (the core of the coalition made that decision last \n     night, but they are checking with the gay rights groups),'' \n     staffers wrote Mr. Kennedy in a June 12, 2002, memo.\n       But even as late as early 2003, Democrats appeared \n     concerned that they would not succeed in mounting a full-\n     scale filibuster against their first target.\n       In a January 2003 meeting between Democrats on the \n     Judiciary Committee and Democratic leaders in the Senate, \n     Democrats agreed to attempt a filibuster against Mr. Estrada.\n       ``All in attendance agreed to attempt to filibuster the \n     nomination of Miguel Estrada, if they have the votes to \n     defeat cloture,'' the judiciary aides wrote. ``They also \n     agreed that, if they do not have the votes to defeat cloture, \n     a contested loss would be worse than no contest.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n                      A Unique Case of Obstruction\n\n       In the current debate over judicial nominations, some \n     commentators claim Republicans such as myself are \n     misrepresenting history by suggesting the current filibuster \n     tactics of the Democrats are unprecedented.\n       These commentators cite the 1968 nomination of Abe Fortas \n     to be chief justice of the United States as an example of how \n     Republicans once attempted to block a judicial nomination on \n     the Senate floor. I welcome the opportunity to respond to \n     this claim, because the more Americans learn about the \n     history of judicial nominations, the more they will realize \n     how terribly off-track our confirmation process has become.\n       In 1968, President Lyndon Johnson sought to elevate his \n     longtime personal lawyer, then-Associate Supreme Court \n     Justice Abe Fortas, to be chief justice. I would not be \n     elected a senator for a few more months, but followed the \n     news surrounding this nomination closely.\n       There were problems with the Fortas nomination from the \n     beginning. Not only did he represent the most aggressive \n     judicial activism of the Warren court, but it soon became \n     apparent Justice Fortas had demonstrated lax ethical \n     standards while serving as an associate justice.\n       For example, it emerged Fortas had taken more than $15,000 \n     in outside income from sources with interests before the \n     federal courts. This was more than 40 percent of his salary \n     at the time, or about $80,000 in today's dollars.\n       More fundamentally, Fortas never took off his political hat \n     when he became a judge. While serving as a Supreme Court \n     justice, Fortas continued serving as an informal political \n     adviser to the president and even involved himself in Vietnam \n     War policy. It later emerged Fortas had discussed pending \n     cases with the president, an obvious violation of \n     professional ethics.\n       In fact, less than a year after his nomination as chief \n     justice was withdrawn by President Johnson, Justice Fortas \n     was forced to resign from the Supreme Court due to ethical \n     breaches.\n       The claim Fortas was not confirmed due to a ``filibuster'' \n     is off-base. A filibuster, commonly understood, occurs when a \n     minority of senators prevents a majority from voting up-or-\n     down on a matter by use or threat of permanent debate.\n       That simply did not happen with Fortas, where the Senate \n     debated the nomination's merits quite vigorously. Senators \n     exposed the ethical issues involved and the widespread belief \n     the vacancy had been manufactured for political purposes. \n     They sought to use debate to persuade other senators the \n     nomination should be defeated.\n       After less than a week, the Senate leadership tried to shut \n     down debate. At that time, two-thirds of the senators voting \n     were needed to do so, yet only 45 senators supported the \n     motion. Of the 43 senators who still wished to debate the \n     nomination, 23 were Republicans and 19 were Democrats.\n       President Johnson saw the writing on the wall--that Fortas \n     did not have 51 senators in support of his nomination--so he \n     withdrew the nomination before debate could be completed.\n       The events of 37 years ago contrast markedly with those the \n     Senate Faces today:\n       (1) Fortas lacked majority support when President Johnson \n     withdrew his nomination. Today, Senate Democrats block up-or-\n     down votes on judicial nominees who are supported by a \n     majority of senators.\n       (2) Justice Fortas was politically associated with \n     President Johnson and eventually resigned from the Supreme \n     Court under an ethical cloud. No such charges have been made \n     against President Bush's nominees.\n       (3) The Senate debated the Fortas nomination only for \n     several days before Johnson withdrew the nomination, versus \n     the four years some of President Bush's nominees have been \n     pending. It's clear the Democrats today have no desire to \n     persuade, and have even complained further debate is a \n     ``waste of time.''\n       (4) Fortas' support and opposition were bipartisan, with \n     Republicans and Democrats on both sides of the question. \n     Today, the controversy is purely partisan--with only \n     Democratic senators, led by their leader Harry Reid, opposing \n     an up-or-down vote.\n       I recall two judicial nominations of President Clinton's \n     particularly troubling to me and my fellow Republican members \n     when I was the Republican Leader in the Senate. Despite our \n     objections, both received an up-or-down vote on the Senate \n     floor. In fact, I voted to end debate on one of these \n     nominees while voting against his confirmation. Republicans \n     chose not to filibuster because it was considered \n     inappropriate for nominations to the federal bench.\n       By creating a new 60-vote threshold for confirming judicial \n     nominees, today's Senate Democrats have abandoned more than \n     200 years of Senate tradition.\n       For the first time, judicial nominees with clear majority \n     support are denied an up-or-down vote on the Senate floor \n     through an unprecedented use of the filibuster. This is not a \n     misrepresentation of history; it's a fact.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  He quoted that wonderful and very important editorial by former \nmajority leader, Bob Dole, saying without any doubt this is an \nunprecedented act to filibuster. I notice that Senator Hatch, one of \nour most distinguished Members, the former chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, has just joined us on the floor.\n  I will ask the Senator from Missouri if he remembers, several years \nago, after Senator Dole had left the Senate, that a discussion was had \nin the Republican Conference about the possibility of filibustering \njudges, and that Chairman Hatch explained to us that it was totally \nagainst the traditions of the Senate, and we did not maintain a \nfilibuster against Clinton judges. I wonder if he remembers that.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I seem to recall that. I thought it was a \nvery statesmanlike and accurate portrayal of the traditions of this \nbody and the requirements of the Constitution, and I once again commend \nour colleague from Utah, who at that time was in a position where he \nobviously could have mustered 41 votes to block the nominee. It was the \nview of those of us who agreed with the Senator from Utah that we \nshould not do that because the people of America elected a President \nwho has--we know and he knows--the power to nominate judges. And it is \nnecessary to maintain a well-staffed judiciary that we give prompt and \nup-or-down votes to these nominees.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator from Missouri. I will say, I did \nnot hear all of his remarks, but I heard a good portion of them, and if \nanyone would like an accurate summary of the status of our situation, I \nsuggest they read his remarks. So far as I can tell, everything he said \nis accurate. So far as I can tell, much of what we have heard from the \nother side is inaccurate, distorting of the traditions of the Senate,\n\n[[Page S5476]]\n\nand not a fair summary of the situation we are in. I feel very strongly \nabout it.\n  There is a huge issue at stake. And the issue is how the Federal \ncourts will be staffed and operate. What do we want and what do we \nexpect from Federal judges? How do we expect them to behave? President \nBush says he believes judges should be faithful to the law and the \nConstitution, that they are not empowered to use activist tactics to \nreinterpret and manipulate the meaning of the words in the Constitution \nor a statute to further a personal agenda they might favor. But they \nare judges. They are referees, umpires to settle disputes by \ninterpreting the law fairly and objectively. If we get away from that, \nour judiciary is in great danger.\n  I believe Senator Bond is correct, also, in saying this memo that was \njust produced, and other actions I have seen over the years I have been \nin the Senate, indicate to me that too often our colleagues have \noutsourced their valuation, outsourced their decision making process on \njudges to very hard-left groups who are not honest, who deliberately \ndistort the record of fine nominees, who attempt to manipulate the \npress nationwide, who raise money with an effort to destroy people's \nreputations in a way that is not legitimate and unfair. I believe that \nstrongly. I have seen it time and time again.\n  It is time to bring that to a conclusion. One of our great traditions \nin the Senate is to give a nominee an up-or-down vote. Senator Hatch, \nwho is on the Senate floor, was my chairman of the Judiciary Committee \nfor a number of years. Senator Hatch warned us when I came to the \nSenate. There were a lot of people who felt strongly about some \nactivist nominees of the Clinton administration. We were very concerned \nwith them.\n  I see my colleague, the Senator from Oklahoma, who was in the House. \nThe House Members were unhappy with us. They thought we ought to \nfilibuster some of these nominees. And we considered it. People \ndiscussed it. Senator Hatch made a very strong, clear presentation in \nthe Republican Conference. He said no, that it was against our \ntraditions. It would be bad public policy. It would alter the balance \nof power in the separation of powers by creating now a super majority \nneeded for the confirmation of judges. He said we should not do it. And \nthe Republicans were in the majority. We had a majority in the Senate, \nat one time 55 Members.\n  So the question was, What about some of these nominees that were \nobjected to? I objected to two from the Ninth Circuit very strongly. \nThe Ninth Circuit was the most activist circuit in America. It had been \nreversed by the U.S. Supreme Court in 27 out of 28 cases. It was out of \nstep. The New York Times said in an article that a majority of the \nSupreme Court considered the Ninth Circuit a rogue circuit. Yet \nPresident Clinton was appointing two ultra-liberal activists to the \ncourt.\n  But what happened to those two judges? We have heard the democrats \ncomplain about on occasion: Judges Paez and Berzon. The Republican \nmajority leader of the Senate, Trent Lott, called those nominees up and \nasked for an up-or-down vote by cloture motion. Those of us who opposed \nthem--I certainly was one of them--voted for cloture, voted to give \nthem an up-or-down vote, even though we intensely opposed them. They \nwere given an up-or-down vote, and they were confirmed. President \nClinton's nominees, when the majority was in the hands of the \nRepublicans, were moved, after full debate and an opportunity to make \ntheir case. They brought them up, and they were given that up-or-down \nvote. That is the principle under which the Senate has operated.\n  Some say, well, we might want to filibuster in the future. Well, we \nhave not filibustered in the past, not for 200 years.\n  Now, how did this situation that we are facing happen? There is no \nmystery if you look at the history of it. Senator Bond made a number of \nthe points. But not long after President Bush was elected, in 2000, the \nDemocrats went to a retreat. According to a New York Times article that \nreported on it, three very liberal, capable law professors--Laurence \nTribe, Marcia Greenberger, Cass Sunstein--met with them in retreat. And \nthey returned from that retreat with the conclusion that they were \ngoing to change the ground rules of confirmations.\n  That is what we have seen time and again in a whole lot of ways. The \nground rules were changed. For example, not long after that, one \nRepublican Member switched parties and we ceased to be the majority \nparty, and so the Judiciary Committee had a majority of Democrats on \nit. The first nine nominees who had been submitted--several of these \nnominees were in that group, including Priscilla Owen and others--were \nnominated in 2001. They would not bring them up in committee. Then \nafter they moved two nominees--one was a minority and the other was a \nDemocrat. They moved those two, but these other fine nominees never \nmoved out of committee. They were changing the ground rules then.\n  Then after the Republicans regained the majority, they commenced an \nunprecedented attempt to filibuster in committee--something we had \nnever seen before. We had to have a fight over that in committee, under \nChairman Hatch's leadership, and we reversed that. They were going to \nfilibuster nominees in committee. It is so contrary to what they were \nsaying a few years ago on the floor of the Senate.\n  On Tuesday of this week, Senator Boxer railed against Janice Rogers \nBrown, but this is what she said about judicial nominees when President \nClinton was in office:\n\n       According to the United States Constitution, the President \n     nominates, and the Senate shall provide advice and consent. \n     It is not the role of the Senate to obstruct the process and \n     prevent numbers of highly qualified nominees from even being \n     given the opportunity for a vote on the Senate floor.\n\n  Now, she has been inconsistent, I would say. But Chairman Hatch has \nbeen consistent. When he opposed Clinton nominees, he gave them an up-\nor-down vote, and so did Trent Lott. As soon as the situation flops, \nsome of the Democratic Senators flopped. Senator Schumer was one of the \nmost outspoken complainers during the Clinton administration. He said:\n\n       I also plead with my colleagues to move judges with \n     alacrity--vote them up or down.\n\n  I agree with that, Senator Schumer.--\n\n       But this delay makes a mockery of the Constitution, makes a \n     mockery of the fact that we are here working, and makes a \n     mockery of the lives of the very sincere people who have put \n     themselves forward to be judges and then they hang out here \n     in limbo.\n\n  Senator Leahy, now leading the filibuster, was on the floor talking \nabout that. Back when the Clinton administration was submitting judges, \nhe said:\n\n       I have had judicial nominations by both Democrat and \n     Republican Presidents that I intended to oppose. But I fought \n     like mad to make sure they at least got a chance to be on the \n     floor for a vote. I have stated over and over again on this \n     floor that I would refuse to put an anonymous hold on a \n     judge; that I would object and fight against any filibuster \n     on a judge, whether it is somebody I opposed or supported; \n     that I felt the Senate should do its duty. If we don't like \n     somebody the President nominates, vote him or her up or down. \n     But don't hold them in this anonymous unconscionable limbo. . \n     . .\n\n  Well, I see Chairman Hatch is here. I know the time is a bit drawn. \nChairman Hatch and the Republican leadership have been consistent on \nthis issue, even when it was not to their political benefit to do so. \nWe have opposed the idea of filibusters and have not supported it. The \nDemocrats oppose them when it is convenient and support them when it is \nconvenient. I think their position is untenable as a matter of \nprinciple and as a matter of public policy, and our country will not be \nbetter off for filibustering judges.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). The Senator from Utah is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his kind remarks, \nand other colleagues as well. I ask unanimous consent that I be given \nthe original half-hour time and that the Democrats be extended an equal \namount of time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague from Alabama. He \nknows about as much as anybody who has ever sat on this side of the \naisle. He has the sting of having been rejected by the Judiciary \nCommittee Democrats when he was nominated for a Federal\n\n[[Page S5477]]\n\njudgeship years ago. I think that is pretty ironic. They knew he was \ngood and that he could do the job. Now he is a sitting Senator who can \nno longer be ignored, and he has stood up and triumphed for so many \ngood people through the years. I think it was kind of a God-given thing \nthat he was rejected back then, so he could sit in the Senate and tell \npeople the important aspects of the Federal judiciary we have been \ndiscussing. I personally love and appreciate him. He has been a great \nmember of the Judiciary Committee and I have a lot of respect for him.\n  I have also been told that at the beginning of the session today, one \nof the leaders offered to discharge a number of judges from the \ncommittee, or judgeship nominees. I find that pretty ironic because at \nthe end of the 108th Congress, when I attempted to discharge three \nnominees to the floor--Tom Griffith, our former counsel, nominated for \nthe DC circuit; J. Michael Seabright, who was from Hawaii and was \nsponsored very strongly by the two Hawaiian Senators; and Paul Crotty, \nfrom New York, who was sponsored strongly by the two New York \nSenators--the Democrats opposed that and said this was extremely \nunprecedented, and they prevented me from doing so because they claimed \n``proper order'' for all nominees.\n  Forgive me, Mr. President, if I find the recent Democratic request to \ndischarge people they want to discharge--three Sixth Circuit nominees--\nmore than a little disingenuous. It is only done to try to make it look \nas though they are trying to cooperate when in fact they knew that \ncould not be permitted. The leadership in the Senate will decide what \njudges come to the floor and we want all of them, including the three \nfrom Michigan.\n  Last week when the Judiciary Committee considered the asbestos bill, \none of our Democratic colleagues referred to proposed amendments to \nthat bill and said something very important: Let's debate them up or \ndown. He said it the way the American people believe it, and that is \ndebating and voting is what legislators do. Let's debate them and then \nvote them up or down.\n  The Senator offering that idea was my colleague from Vermont, Senator \nLeahy. He was speaking then about legislation, but he and other \nDemocrats once insisted the Senate should follow the same principle as \nwe evaluate the President's judicial nominations.\n  In October 1997, for example, he said on the Senate floor:\n\n       I hope we might reach a point where we as a Senate will \n     accept our responsibility and vote people up, vote them down. \n     Bring the names here. If we want to vote against them, vote \n     against them.\n\n  Of course, at that time, a Democratic President was in power. That \nmay have been the difference between then and now.\n  It is always refreshing to see our fellow citizens from all over this \ngreat country coming here to sit up in the galleries and observe their \nSenate at work. Some of them with us today might actually be asking, \nWhy is the Senator from Utah making such a big deal about something \nthat is so obvious--votes up or down, that is. Many of our fellow \ncitizens may be surprised to learn that some of the Senators they \nelected and sent to Congress are refusing to vote on nominations. They \nmight share the sentiment of former Democratic leader Senator Tom \nDaschle when he said in 1999--of course, Clinton was President:\n\n       I find it simply baffling that a Senator would vote against \n     even voting on a judicial nomination.\n\n  That is what they are doing. I guess it makes a difference whether \nyour President is President or whether the opposition President is \nPresident. I happen to think there are certain virtues that ought to be \nmaintained, no matter what.\n  Those Senators on the other side are blocking votes because they know \nthey will lose those votes. If we debate these nominees, America would \nbetter understand why we need judges who will interpret, not make, the \nlaw. Americans will see how these highly qualified judicial nominees \nmeet that standard, and America will see that these nominees, every one \nof them, have a bipartisan majority support.\n  What is wrong with giving them a vote up or down? The political \nforces promoting an activist political judiciary oppose many of these \nnominees, and their strategy is simple. The Senate cannot confirm \nnominees if Senators cannot vote on them. We cannot vote if we cannot \nend debate. These filibusters use Senate rules to prevent ending \ndebate, prevent taking a vote, and prevent confirmation of these \njudges. That is not only baffling, it is unprecedented. This is not a \ntangent, an academic issue, or a question that will 1 day be found in \nthe game ``Trivial Pursuit Senate Edition.'' This issue is central to \nthis debate, and our Democratic colleagues know it.\n  Some are so desperate to claim even one single solitary precedent for \nwhat they are doing that they stretch, twist, and morph the word \n``filibuster'' beyond all recognition. They want the word \n``filibuster'' to mean so many things that it ultimately means \nvirtually nothing at all.\n  Unfortunately, these mischaracterizations of Senate history, \ntradition, and rules cynically exploit the fact that many of our fellow \ncitizens have not mastered the particulars of Senate history, the \npeculiarities of Senate procedure, or the idiosyncrasies of the \nconfirmation process. Misleading, confusing, patently false claims can \neasily take on a life of their own, echoed and repeated throughout the \nmedia, cyberspace, and even here on the Senate floor.\n  We all know it can take a long time for what is true to catch up with \nwhat is false. Judicial filibuster defenders who claimed that when the \nSenate voted to end debate on past judicial nominations, we were \nactually filibustering those nominations; that when we voted down \ndebate and confirmed them, we were actually filibustering--poppycock. \nThey want Americans to believe that ending debate then justifies \nrefusing to end debate now. Poppycock. Or they claim that when the \nSenate voted to confirm judicial nominations in the past, we were \nactually filibustering those nominations when we voted to confirm them. \nThat is how far they have gone to try and justify these inappropriate \nactions.\n  They want Americans to believe that confirming nominations then, as \nwe did, justifies refusing to confirm them now. Those bizarre claims \nfocus on what happens here on the Senate floor at the end of the \njudicial confirmation process. Sometimes judicial filibuster defenders \non the other side have focused instead on what happens in the Judiciary \nCommittee, an earlier phase in the process. Some appear willing to try \nanything to create a precedent for their filibusters. Some even claim \nthat any nomination which is not audibly confirmed, no matter what the \nreason, no matter what the step in the process, has been filibustered. \nGiving a word any meaning you want may help make any argument you want \nto make, but it does not make that argument legitimate. This gimmick \nmay have some public relations punch. It leads to cliches such as \n``pocket filibuster'' or ``one-man filibuster,'' and creates villains, \nsuch as me. What kind of campaign would this be without a bogeyman? \nAfter all, I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee for 6 years under \nPresident Clinton.\n\n  Never mind that the Republican Senate confirmed 377 judges for \nPresident Clinton, just 5 short of the all-time confirmation record set \nby President Reagan. Bill Clinton was the second confirmation champion \nof judges in the history of this country, and he had 6 years when I was \nchairman. I wonder how that happened if I was so partisan.\n  Never mind that President Reagan had his own party controlling the \nSenate for 6 years while President Clinton had the other party, the \nRepublicans, controlling the Senate for 6 of his years. So Reagan had \nhis own party help him for 6 years. President Clinton only had his own \nparty for 2 years, and yet he still came in just five votes shy of \nPresident Reagan. And if my recollection serves me correctly, he would \nhave been three ahead of him had it not been for Democratic holds on \ntheir side. One Senator was not getting his; therefore, he would not \nlet anybody else get theirs. It happened. Never mind facts such as \nthat.\n  The assistant minority leader yesterday claimed every Clinton \nnomination that was not audibly confirmed was filibustered and that I \npersonally buried them. My hand alone held back a confirmation wave of \napparently mythic proportions. Look for a moment what it takes to \nbelieve every\n\n[[Page S5478]]\n\nunconfirmed nominee is a filibustered nominee. It requires believing \ndozens of nominees President Clinton himself withdrew were \nfilibustered. Preposterous. President Clinton, for example, withdrew \none of his court nominees fewer than 6 months after her nomination \nbecause of health concerns. Her nomination did not get out of the \nJudiciary Committee, did not receive a floor vote, and was not \nconfirmed. But was she filibustered? They seem to think so.\n  Is her situation the same as Justice Priscilla Owen who has been \nwaiting for more than 4 years and cannot get a floor vote because of a \nDemocratic filibuster, a leader-led partisan filibuster, the first time \nin history?\n  This line that all unconfirmed nominees are filibustered nominees \nrequires you to believe ill-founded arguments such as that. It also \nrequires believing that the 28 nominations sent too late to be \nconsidered or which President Clinton chose not to resubmit were \nfilibustered.\n  That is how they add, they double count. It is ridiculous. \nPreposterous is the word.\n  It requires believing that nominations not given hearings because of \nopposition by their home State Senators were filibustered. We have had \nthat go on for years, whoever has been in power. Home State Senators \nhave a lot of swat. The Judiciary Committee system that gives extra \nweight to the views of Senators from a nominee's home State has been in \nplace in various forms for nearly a century. Democrats, as well as \nRepublicans, use it. I do not hear the Democrats who now want to call \nthese situations filibusters also calling to abolish that system of \nhome State senatorial courtesy. They cannot have it both ways.\n  The majority leader, Senator Frist, recently offered a proposal that \nwould not only address our concerns about the floor by ensuring up-or-\ndown votes, but also address Democrats' concerns about the committee by \nguaranteeing reporting of nominees. The majority leader tried to do \nthat. Democrats rejected that offer. They are not going to give up \ntheir rights in committee anymore than Republicans should give up their \nrights in committee.\n  But that is not filibustering, I can guarantee that. Either they \nthink treatment of judicial nominees in the Judiciary Committee is a \nproblem needing a remedy or they do not. They cannot have it both ways. \nDemocrats know that many factors determining whether a nomination is \napproved by the Judiciary Committee are not simply up to the chairman's \nunilateral discretion. What galls me is some who have made the \nargument. One in particular this morning begged me to get his judges \nthrough, and I have to say there were real questions about his judges, \nbut I put them through because they were nominated by the President. He \ncame to me and asked that I get it done. I did it for countless \nDemocrats in the 6 years I was chairman of the committee during the \nClinton years, and they know it. They do not have any other arguments.\n  So what do they want to do? They want to vilify the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee who has had to put up with all kinds of \nmachinations in the Judiciary Committee from both sides, whoever the \nchairman is. Democrats know there are procedures in the Judiciary \nCommittee and on the floor for forcing a committee chairman to act if \nSenators believe the chairman is dragging his feet and that those \nprocedures were never used, never even attempted, while I was chairman. \nWhy? Because they knew darn well I was trying to do the best I could.\n  They do not have any other arguments. They cannot justify their \nposition. Democrats know these things. They also know that many of our \nfellow citizens do not. So the spin machine cooks up this tail that all \nunconfirmed nominees are filibustered nominees, attempting to make \npeople believe there is some precedent, even a totally fictional \nprecedent, for their current filibusters. Saying that ending a debate \nis the same as not ending a debate did not work. Saying that confirming \nnominations is the same as not confirming nominations did not work. \nSaying that President Clinton's near record confirmation total is \nevidence of unfair treatment by Republicans will not work either.\n  On Tuesday the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. Feingold, \nwas making a few other arguments. He pointed out that the text of the \nConstitution does not require an up-or-down confirmation vote for a \njudicial nomination.\n  Well, many of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle attack \njudicial nominees when they take the Constitution's text this \nseriously. But I am glad that the Senator from Wisconsin is doing so.\n  The word ``filibuster'' is not found in the Constitution, either. Nor \nare phrases such as ``unlimited debate,'' ``minority rights,'' or even \n``checks and balances,'' as misused as those terms have been by the \nother side.\n  None of the phrases used by some to try to give these judicial \nfilibusters a constitutional anchor are in the chartered text, the \nconstitutional text. What the Constitution does say, however, is that \nthe President has the power to nominate and appoint judges--not the \nSenate, the President has that power. Our role of advice and consent is \na check on the President's power to appoint.\n  When the filibuster turns our check on the President's power into a \nweapon that hijacks the President's power, then, yes, it has indeed \nviolated the design that is most certainly in the text of the \nConstitution, and that is what they are doing.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin also said the procedure the majority \nleader may use to prohibit judicial filibusters will mean changing the \nSenate rules by fiat. That is a variation on the Democratic mantra that \nthis would break the rules to change the rules. That is a catchy little \nphrase but neither of its catchy little parts is true.\n  The Senate operates not only by its written rules but also by \nparliamentary precedence established when the Presiding Officer rules \non questions of procedure asked by the Senators. What we call the \nconstitutional option would seek such a ruling from the Presiding \nOfficer. After sufficient debate, the Senate should vote on a judicial \nnomination. That is what the ruling would be. Senate precedents and \nprocedures would change, but Senate rules would remain unchanged. No \nbreaking of the rules, no changing of the rules.\n  Senators use the word ``fiat'' because it sounds bad and fits with \nthe abuse of power theme probably born in some liberal focus group \nsomewhere. The word attempts to give people a bad impression, but it \nshould give them an even worse impression to know that it is patently \nfalse.\n  The Constitution gives authority over Senate rules and procedures to \nthe Senate, not to the Parliamentarian or to the Presiding Officer but \nto the Senate. If the Presiding Officer rules on the question of \nprocedure, it will not actually change Senate procedures until a \nmajority of the Senators vote to do so.\n  Just as American self-government is radically different from \nmonarchy, Senate self-government is radically different from fiat.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin said that whenever the Senate merely takes \na cloture vote or a vote to end debate, a filibuster is always \nunderway. That, too, is patently false.\n\n  Let me refer to this chart. This is what the Congressional Research \nService said on April 22, 2005:\n\n       It is erroneous to assume that cases in which cloture is \n     sought are always the same as those in which a filibuster \n     occurs.\n\n  Let me repeat that.\n\n       It is erroneous to assume that cases in which cloture is \n     sought are always the same as those in which a filibuster \n     occurs.\n\n  Let me use two examples. Among President Clinton's most controversial \nnominees were Marsha Berzon and Richard Paez nominated to the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Our colleague from New York, \nSenator Schumer, who has spoken many times on the floor on this issue, \nin November 2003 called these nominees ``very liberal,'' and, ``quite \nfar to the left.'' Now, that is quite something coming from a Senator \nwho has never been called even a little bit to the right.\n  On November 10, 1999, the majority leader at the time, Senator Lott, \npromised that he would bring these controversial nominations up for a \nconfirmation vote no later than March 15, 2000, and that was at my \nrequest. He correctly said that I agreed with using the cloture vote to \nensure that a confirmation vote occurred. In other words, it was used \nto get to a vote.\n\n[[Page S5479]]\n\n  On March 8, 2000, that is exactly what we did. It was of a procedural \nfloor management device. The first two names on the petition for the \ncloture vote happened to be Senator Lott and myself. We took that \ncloture vote to prevent a filibuster and to ensure an up-or-down vote. \nWe prevented a filibuster. That vote occurred, and the Senate confirmed \nboth nominees. They are today sitting Federal judges. Otherwise we \nwould have kept going on and on on the Senate floor. We decided that is \nthe way to get to a vote, and we did.\n  The Senator from Vermont, Mr. Leahy, said on Tuesday that the \nconstitutional option which would use a parliamentary ruling to \nprohibit judicial filibusters would ``use majority power to override \nthe rights of the minority.'' I have called this parliamentary approach \nthe Byrd option because when Senator Byrd was the majority leader in \nthe late 1970s and early 1980s, Senator Byrd used it to change Senate \nprocedures. He did so regarding legislation and also regarding \nnomination-related filibusters.\n  In 1980, for example, then-Majority Leader Byrd wanted to prohibit \nfilibusters with a motion to proceed to nominations, and they could do \nthat back then, just as a confirmation vote cannot happen if debate \ndoes not end. Debate cannot start if the Senate cannot vote to proceed \nto that debate.\n  Today we hear that any limitation on debate, any restriction of the \nfilibuster, strikes at the very heart of the essence of this \ninstitution. Maybe it was a different story back then when they were in \ncontrol. When the Presiding Officer ruled against what Majority Leader \nByrd was trying to do, he then appealed that ruling and the Senate \nvoted to overturn it, effectively terminating those nomination-related \nfilibusters. He knew how the vote was going to turn out in the end.\n  I remind my colleagues what my good Democratic friend from West \nVirginia said when he used the procedure to change the filibuster rule, \non January 4, 1995, during the Clinton administration. He said:\n\n       I have seen filibusters. I have helped to break them. There \n     are few Senators in this body who were here [in 1977] when I \n     broke the filibuster on the natural gas bill. . . . I asked \n     Mr. Mondale, the vice president, to go please sit in the \n     chair; I wanted to make some points of order and create some \n     new precedents that would break these filibusters.\n\n  Then he said this:\n\n       And the filibuster was broken--back, neck, legs, and arms. \n     . . . So I know something about filibusters. I helped to set \n     a great many of the precedents that are on the books here.\n\n  Well, the Senator was candid. I personally admire him for it. On at \nleast three other occasions, Majority Leader Byrd used a ruling by the \nPresiding Officer to change Senate procedures without changing the \nunderlying Senate rules.\n  The Senator from Vermont says that using this very same mechanism \ntoday would be an outrageous trashing of minority rights. Yet he voted \nevery time to support Majority leader Byrd's use of that mechanism, \nincluding to eliminate nomination related filibusters.\n  Yesterday, the Senator from Illinois, Senator Durbin, claimed that \nSenate rules, in his words, from the very beginning, required an \nextraordinary majority to end debate.\n  Now that is factual claim, and it is factually false.\n  The Senate adopted its first rules in 1789. Rule eight allowed a \nsimple majority to proceed to a vote. The men who founded this republic \ndesigned this Senate without the minority's ability to filibuster \nanything.\n  Over the last few days, many excuses have been offered why some \nrefuse to debate and vote on judicial nominations that reach the Senate \nfloor.\n  Let me correct that. While these may be their reasons, there are no \nvalid excuses.\n  When procedural obstructive devices such as the filibuster are kept \nwhere they belong, in the legislative process, the debate can properly \nfocus on the merits of these nominees. That is what debating and voting \nshould ultimately be about, the President's nominees.\n  The debate we have seen here on the Senate floor regarding nominees \nsuch as Justices Priscilla Owen and Janice Rogers Brown is typical of \nwhat we will see in the future regarding other nominees.\n  Many of our fellow citizen may know little of the Senate's Byzantine \nprocedures, they may know little about judicial rulings, they may not \nspeak legalese, but I hope they will not be afraid to participate in \nthis process.\n  Let me offer a few pointers, a few tips, for the road ahead.\n  Politics is often about results, about winners and losers, and \ninvolves politicians asserting their will. Law is about the process of \nreaching results, about what the law requires, and involves judges \nusing judgment.\n  Politics and law are two very different things, and our liberty \ndepends on preserving that difference. So if you hear critics of \njudicial nominees talking only in the language of politics, you know \nsomething is wrong.\n  In the last day or two, for example, critics of the nominees before \nus have reduced them to sound bites, checklists, and litmus tests.\n  Senators begin sentences with phrases such as she ruled that . . . or \nshe ruled for. . . .\n  Mentioning only those results, without exploring how a judge reached \nthose results, amounts to applying political criteria to a judicial \nnominee, and that is fundamentally wrong. Sometimes the law requires \nresults we may not like, results that may even sound dramatic.\n  Mentioning the political results without the judicial process leading \nto those results misleads people about what judges do and how to choose \nthe rights ones.\n  Or the critics will characterize what a judge said rather than tell \nus what she actually said.\n  Or if they do quote the judge, critics will often pluck out only a \nphrase, or use lots of ellipses.\n  These are signs that spin may be in the air.\n  Or the critics will quote other critics. Imagine if the only thing \nsomeone knew about you came from what your critics or enemies said \nabout you. That picture would be distorted, incomplete, and just plain \nfalse.\n  So our fellow citizens should not be worried that they do not know \nthe language of lawyers, that they have not read a judicial nominee's \nwritings or rulings, or are not well-versed in the fine points of legal \nargument.\n  I hope they will listen critically to the debate here in the Senate \nabout these nominees, their qualifications, and their records.\n  I hope our fellow citizens will be very skeptical of critics who make \na political case against a judicial nominee, skeptical if the case \nagainst a nominee is limited to soundbites about results or \ncharacterizations by third parties.\n  Let me conclude my remarks by noting that in September 2000, the \nSenator from Michigan, Senator Levin, said that the Constitution each \nof us has sworn to protect and defend requires that we debate and vote \non judicial nominations reaching the floor.\n  I agreed with that principle then, and I agree with it today.\n  For more than two centuries, we kept the filibuster out of the \njudicial confirmation process.\n  It is surely not a good sign about our political culture that we must \ntoday formalize by parliamentary ruling a standard we once observed by \nprinciple and self-restraint.\n  But that self-restraint has broken down, and maintaining our \ntradition of up or down votes for judicial nominations is worth \ndefending. Once we take unprecedented obstruction tactics like the \nfilibuster off the table, we can focus where we should, on the merits \nand qualifications of nominees.\n  We must have a standard that binds both political parties. That \nstandard must be fair, it must respect the separation of powers, and it \nmust be consistent with our own Senate tradition.\n  Between 1789 and 2003, we had a strong consistent tradition of voting \non judicial nominations once they reach the Senate floor.\n  We should return to that principle and practice.\n  Unfortunately, in 2003, the Democratic leadership broke with this \nlongstanding Senate tradition and took an ill-founded turn down a \npartisan political path and unwisely changed the confirmation process \nin an unprecedented fashion.\n  We must turn back from that path. Once a judicial nomination reaches \nus here, our course should be clear. Let us debate and then let us \nvote.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S5480]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I understand that under the previous \nagreement, I have 15 minutes. Is that correct? Mr. President, I will \nyield myself 15 minutes. I ask consent to be able to proceed for 15 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask the Chair if he will be good enough to let me know \nwhen there is 3 minutes left.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will so notify the Senator.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I will take a few moments of the time of the Senate, \nand for those who are watching this debate, to try to put this whole \nissue of what I consider to be an arrogant grab for power in some \nperspective. I urge my colleagues, perhaps over the course of the \nweekend, take 2 or 3 hours and reread the debates on the Constitutional \nConvention, about how our Founding Fathers wanted the selection of \njudges for the courts of this country to be done.\n  There were three different occasions during the Constitutional \nConvention when our Founding Fathers considered who should appoint the \njudges who were going to serve on the courts of this country. The first \ntwo times the Founding Fathers debated this and discussed this, they \nmade a unanimous recommendation that it would be solely the Senate of \nthe United States that would be the sole judge for nominating and \napproving judges who were going to serve on the courts. Then, as the \nConstitutional Convention came to an end, 8 days before the end of the \nConstitutional Convention, they came back and they were reviewing the \ntotality of their work and at that time they made a judgment and \ndecision that was virtually unanimous that they would provide a shared \nresponsibility between the executive and the Senate of the United \nStates.\n  No one can read the debates of the Constitutional Convention and not \nunderstand that the Senate of the United States is effectively, in the \neyes of the Founding Fathers, a coequal partner in the naming of \njudges.\n  I know it has been fashionable around here for many years, \nparticularly for those of the majority party--and I have seen it done \neven on our side when we were the majority party--for a Democrat to \nsay: Look, if the President of the United States nominates, there has \nto be a heavy burden on any individual to vote against it. It ought to \nbe automatic. It ought to be effectively a rubberstamp.\n  That has never been my position. I have always felt and understood \nthat we have an independent judgment and decision as charged by our \nFounding Fathers to exercise our own good judgment. That has been the \nhistory of the Senate.\n  We have listened--I have--to a lot of debates, saying what we are \ndoing is going back to the original intent of our Founding Fathers. \nThat does not happen to be factually true.\n  I reviewed yesterday those who have held the seat I hold in the \nSenate. Going back to John Quincy Adams, going back to Charles Sumner, \ngoing back to Daniel Webster--to President Kennedy--the series of \nSupreme Court nominees they considered, and those they voted for and \nthose they voted against: there never was a single time when any \nSenator from Massachusetts was effectively muzzled, silenced, gagged \nwhen they were expressing their conscience, their view about the \nmembers going to the Supreme Court or the circuit courts, not in the \nhistory of this body, never.\n  But under the proposal of the majority leader, that will no longer be \nthe case. That no longer will be the case. It is not only the \nsilencing, the muzzling and gagging of any of the Members in here; it \nis breaking the rules in the middle of the game.\n  We have parliamentary rules, like any other legislative body, and we \nhave ways of changing and altering those rules. They are all laid out. \nI will mention them briefly. There is a way to change the rules if we \ndo not like them and we can follow them and conform them to our views. \nBy the Senate rules we can alter and change them. Is that what is going \nto be before the Senate in the nuclear option? Absolutely not. \nAbsolutely not.\n\n  There is a way to change them, but not the way the Republican \nleadership and this administration want to do it. They are effectively \ntearing up the rules. They are basically running roughshod over the \nSenate rules, the institution that has served this Nation well for 224 \nyears. That is what is being proposed. When all is said and done, we \nmention all these other past histories of activities, this is \neffectively what is being done.\n  I think most Americans may take issue with what happens here in the \nSenate. They may agree with the activities of the Senate or may differ \nwith them. But one thing in which the American people have some degree \nof confidence is their basic institutions of Government. With the \nproposal by the majority leader, we are rending asunder the power and \nthe authority that was described in the Constitutional Convention and \ndescribed in the Constitution for the Senate. That is why people are \nfeeling so strongly about this, many of us feel so strongly about \nthis--because basically we are undermining what our Founding Fathers \nwanted.\n  This is an issue that has been overhanging the Senate now for some \nweeks, for some months, in spite of the fact that we have approved 208 \nof the President's judges: 95 percent, a higher percentage than the \nprevious President Bush. What is suddenly the difference? This \nPresident has a higher percentage of his nominees approved than the \nfirst President Bush, Bush 1. The difference is a different political \nclimate. There is a radical right out there that is loose in the \ncountry. They feel they won the Presidency, the House of \nRepresentatives, the Senate of the United States and, by God, they are \ngoing to take over the independent judiciary.\n  That is what this is all about. Meantime, while the so-called nuclear \noption has been hanging out over the Senate, what in the world have we \nbeen doing for the last 5 months? January, February, March, April, and \nnow the third week in May?\n  When I go back to Massachusetts, the people there are talking still \nabout job security and its uncertainty. They are talking about whether \nthey are going to continue to be able to have health insurance. They \nare talking about escalating prices of prescription drugs. They are \ntalking about the increased costs of tuition, whether their children \nare going to be able to go to college. They are talking about what is \nhappening in the schools and the school dropout problems and the fact \nso many classes in our Nation don't have well-trained teachers. They \nare talking about the needs for special education teachers. They are \ntalking about supplementary services for children going to high schools \nthat were guaranteed in the No Child Left Behind Act and too many of \nour school districts are not doing; that is what they are talking \nabout.\n  But what have we been doing? Waiting for the nuclear option. Which \nmeans what? Tear up the rules and we pass class action bills \nbenefitting corporate America, we pass bankruptcy bills that will help \nthe credit card industry. We did take 2 weeks, and deservedly so, on \nthe supplemental appropriations, and we included an amendment to add \nsome armor for our troops over there, of which I highly approved. That \nis it. That is the record. Nothing we really care about. Why? Because \nwe have been absorbed with the nuclear option, changing and altering \nthe rules. Mr. President, 95 percent of approval of this President's \nnominees has been achieved.\n  I frankly feel a great deal of this responsibility is right down at \nthe other end of Pennsylvania Avenue. I can remember in January of this \nyear, in the wake of the conclusion of the election and all of us said, \nThis President won. We congratulate him. We have to bring the country \nback together. I certainly voiced that.\n  My colleague, Senator Kerry, certainly voiced that. What happened? \nThe ballots are barely cast and the votes are hardly counted, and this \nPresident sends up the nominees that have been debated, discussed, had \nhearings, and voted on in the Senate and said: You have to pass these, \nSenate, or we will change the rules.\n  I have taken the time of the Senate in going over the qualifications \nof these. These are not just ordinary nominees. I have gone over these \nin some detail. These nominees are radical. I would say, radical, \noutside the\n\n[[Page S5481]]\n\nmainstream. If you have a nominee such as Mr. Pryor, who thinks we \nought to repeal the Voting Rights Act, I think he is out of the \nmainstream.\n  What he says in his legal papers is in complete conflict with and has \nbeen rejected unanimously by the Supreme Court. He does not understand \nthe Americans With Disabilities Act. He does not understand that \nRepublicans and Democrats alike voted for the Americans With \nDisabilities Act to bring those that are challenged, mentally and \nphysically, into the mainstream of American society. We spent weeks and \nmonths and years to pass that legislation. This is not one Senator who \nwill vote for someone that absolutely wants to undermine and eviscerate \nit, destroy it, and end it. That is what Mr. Pryor's positions lead to.\n  So these are not people that are in the mainstream. We have expressed \nthat. We ought to be able to express it. But that is not satisfactory \nto this administration. No, no. They want to change the rules. That is \nwhat this will be all about. They are effectively saying: Look we have \nnominated, and you are going to go ahead and approve.\n  We have 224 years where they have not been able to silence us, and \nnow they will be able to silence us. But not with this Senator's \nsupport.\n  These are the rules, and I welcome any on the other side to dispute \nthem, and I invite them to put that in the Record. First of all, they \nwill have to put the Vice President of the United States in the \nPresiding Officer's chair. There will not be another Senator in that \nchair to make the ruling because it is not going by the rules of the \nParliamentarian.\n  Do listeners understand that? It is akin to going to the football \ngame and the referee and the umpire call the penalty or the touchdown \nand someone else from the crowd says, no, no, that does not count, and \nfor us it recognizes the ``someone else'' in the crowd. That is what \nthey are doing. They will replace a Member of the Senate. We have, as \nwe do now, the distinguished Senator from Tennessee sitting in the \nchair and presiding over the Senate. But that will not be true that \nparticular day.\n  Next they will have to break paragraph 1 of rule V which requires 1 \nday's specific written notice if a Senator intends to try to suspend or \nchange a rule.\n  And then they break paragraph 2, rule V, which provides that the \nSenate rules remain in force from Congress to Congress unless they are \nchanged in accordance with existing rules.\n  Then they have to break paragraph 2, of rule XXII, which requires a \nmotion signed by 16 Senators, a 2-day wait, and a three-fifths vote to \nclose debate on a nomination.\n  Then they have to break rule XXII requirement of a petition, a 2-day \nwait, and a two-thirds vote to stop debate on a rules change.\n  They have to break scores of the rules. It will make a sham of the \nrules and parliamentary procedures of this Senate. It is wrong.\n  We are witnessing in this debate an arrogant power grab by the \nRepublican right. This is what happens when the rightwing of the \nRepublican Party calls the tune for the Republican Party as a whole. We \nare spending days and weeks debating five rightwing judges but not 5 \nminutes on what counts in most people's lives: Secure jobs, healthy \nfamilies, educational opportunity. Those are not the values and \npriorities we see today from the White House and this Republican \nCongress. To them, history does not matter. Mainstream values do not \nmatter. Our commitment is to working families, and that does not \nmatter.\n  What the Republican Party cares about today is putting a rightwing \nagenda ahead of mainstream values, corporate interests ahead of public \ninterests, and the agenda of the privileged few ahead of the American \ndream for all.\n  We, as Senators, have a choice as well. We can break the rules and \nrun roughshod over our constitutional system of checks and balances or \nwe can seek accommodation and compromise for the good of our democracy \nand the strength of our Nation.\n  The one thing standing between the White House and total control of \nthe Congress and the courts is the Senate's right to full and fair \ndebate. Let's not give it up.\n  As many of us have said, if Republicans persist in the course they \nhave set, they will destroy the ``compact of comity'' that enables the \nSenate to fulfill its constitutional responsibilities.\n  Outside the Capitol, the gravity of that danger may not be self-\nevident.\n  ``Comity'' may be an unused word today, but for 200 years it has been \nthe lifeblood of daily life in the Senate.\n  In the Senate, comity is the glue that binds us to one another and to \nthat small but brilliant group of Framers who met, over two centuries \nago, and conceived of this institution.\n  They certainly knew what comity was: they came from totally different \nviews of government.\n  They labored ceaselessly, in the heat of a Philadelphia summer, in \nthe ultimate American Government Seminar, until they created a \ngovernment that was reliable, resilient--resistant to attack from \nwithin and without.\n  Comity among the Framers--their overriding ``agreement to agree'' \ndespite their deep differences--informed and nourished their efforts. \nThey worked especially hard to design the Senate.\n  Their debates were all about great challenges:\n\n       What size would be right to enable the Senate to serve as a \n     check on the other House and the President too, and still \n     place personal responsibility for their actions on individual \n     Senators?\n       How long should each Senate term last, to set the proper \n     balance between the strong, independent Senate they wanted \n     and the potential tyranny of an aristocratic upper House, \n     insulated from popular opinion?\n       Who would make better judicial choices, the Senate or the \n     Executive?\n\n  Fortunately for us today, their debates were not just theoretical. \nThey were very real and very practical. The Framers understood they \nwere creating a new experiment in the history of government as they \nworked to combine their diverse views into a single concise blueprint.\n  Despite vigorous and fundamental disagreements at the start, they \nretained their respect for one another, their capacity for reason, \ntheir shared concept of what this Nation could be, and what its \ngovernment should be. Consensus was not just a goal, but a necessity. \nCompromise not just an option, but a cornerstone of their creation.\n  It is not an exaggeration to say that if that ``compact of comity'' \nis not preserved, the Senate and the Government will suffer mightily. \nOur vital role in the machinery of checks and balances will fade, and \nthe nation will be left diminished.\n  What would the Framers have done if faced with the challenge we face?\n  They would clearly have counseled respect and moderation.\n  It is not respectful or moderate to suggest, as one of our colleagues \ndid, that judges may have it coming to them if their decisions outrage \nsome people. It is not respectful or moderate to suggest, as the \nmajority leader did yesterday, that Senators are equivalent to the \nassassins of judges because they strongly criticize the political or \nideological views of judicial nominees. As part of its advice and \nconsent function, the Senate has done that since 1795, when it rejected \nGeorge Washington's nomination of John Rutledge to be Chief Justice.\n  The majority leader's use of the word ``assassinate'' was especially \nunfortunate, coming in the very day that Judge Lefkow of Chicago was \ntestifying to our Judiciary Committee about the brutal murders of her \nfamily members.\n  The Founders also would have counseled us about communication. We \nwork with members of the other party every day. We talk to them every \nday. But I can't think of one of them who has come to me over the past \n2 years to say, ``This judicial nomination issue is headed the wrong \nway--we ought to start talking about how to preserve our institution's \nstrengths and traditions, and solve the problems that these judicial \nnominations are creating for us all.'' We all know it is very late in \nthis contest of nuclear ``chicken,'' but it is never too late to try.\n  The Framers would also have told us to minimize the distortions and \nrespect the truth. Again, and again, we are told that there was no \nRepublican-led filibuster of the Fortas nomination to be Chief Justice \nin 1968. There are still three of us in the Senate today, who were in \nthe Senate then, and who know the truth firsthand. It demeans the \nSenate and discredits the debater when\n\n[[Page S5482]]\n\nsomeone parrots the bizarrely erroneous White House talking points \ndenying such a filibuster, without having the grace to check the facts.\n  The Founders would also have told us to take extremely seriously what \nJames Madison in Federalist No. 62, called ``the senatorial trust,' \nwhich require[es] a greater extent of information and stability of \ncharacter.''\n  As Madison understood, Senators are not the owners of this \ninstitution, but we are more than just its occupants. We are, its \ntrustees, with an awesome responsibility to protect that trust--this \nbody--the Senate. That means we must preserve what makes it work well--\nlike extended debate and the super-majority cloture rule.\n  A central part of that senatorial trust is standing up to the \nPresident when he overreaches in the exercise of his power, as he has \ndone with the few, but important, still hotly contested circuit \nnominees.\n  Finally, the Framers would say that our endangered senatorial trust \nneeds comity more than ever in our day-to-day activities and \nrelationships. As Madison stated, the comity the Framers had in mind \nwas--``the result, not of theory, but `of a spirit of amity, and that \nmutual deference and concession which the peculiarity of our political \nsituation rendered indispensable.' '' That is what we must aspire to. \nThat is what we must accomplish if we are not only to solve our present \ndilemma but leave this place as least as fine an institution as we \nfound it.\n  Who are the nominees that the Republicans so want confirmed that \nSenator Frist is willing to violate the rules of the Senate?\n  They include Janice Rogers Brown, who has been nominated to the very \nimportant DC Circuit, which is widely regarded as the most important \ncourt of all the courts of appeals, and whose decisions affect the \nrights of all Americans. She has a compelling personal story, which all \nof us respect. But confirmation to the DC Circuit requires more than a \ncompelling personal story. It requires a record of clear commitment to \nupholding the rights of all Americans. It requires a record of clear \ndedication to the rule of law--not remaking the law to fit a particular \npolitical view.\n  Janice Rogers Brown fails this basic test. Her record on the \nCalifornia Supreme Court makes clear that she's a judicial activist who \nwill roll back basic rights. Her record shows a deep hostility to civil \nrights, to workers' rights, to consumer protection, and to a wide \nvariety of governmental actions in many other areas--the very issues \nthat predominate in the DC Circuit.\n  She has repeatedly voiced contempt for the very idea of democratic \nself-government. She has stated that ``where government moves in, \ncommunity retreats [and] civil society disintegrates.'' She has said \nthat government leads to ``families under siege, war in the streets.'' \nIn her view, ``when government advances . . . freedom is imperiled \n[and] civilization itself jeopardized.''\n  She has criticized the New Deal, which gave us Social Security, the \nminimum wage, and fair labor laws. She has questioned whether age \ndiscrimination laws benefit the public interest. She has even said that \n``Today's senior citizens blithely cannibalize their grandchildren \nbecause they have a right to get as much `free' stuff as the political \nsystem will permit them to extract.''\n  Yet my colleagues say we're wrong to worry about putting Janice \nRogers Brown on the DC Circuit, which is widely regarded as the most \nimportant court of appeals, and is just a heartbeat away from the \nSupreme Court.\n  No one with these views should be given a lifetime appointment to the \nFederal court of appeals, and certainly not to the Federal court most \nresponsible for cases affecting government action. It is no wonder that \nan organization seeking to dismantle Social Security is running ads \nsupporting her nomination to the second most powerful court in the \ncountry.\n  In the area of civil rights, Justice Brown has also written opinions \nthat would roll back basic protections. In a case involving ethnic \nslurs against Latino workers, Justice Brown wrote that the first \namendment prevents courts from stopping ethnic slurs in the workplace, \neven when those slurs create a hostile work environment in violation of \njob discrimination laws. She dissented from a holding that victims of \ndiscrimination may obtain damages from administrative agencies for \ntheir emotional distress. She also wrote an opinion suggesting that \nSupreme Court decisions upholding affirmative action are inconsistent \nwith laws against discrimination.\n  On workers' rights, she rejected a binding precedent limiting an \nemployer's ability to require workers to submit to drug tests.\n  In another case, she wrote a dissent urging the California Supreme \nCourt to strike down a San Francisco law providing housing assistance \nto low-income, elderly, and disabled people. In case after case, she \nhas sought to undermine the rights of the American people.\n  It is a travesty that the majority leader is attempting to break the \nrules of the Senate to confirm such nominees. It takes 67 votes to \nchange Senate rules. Because the majority leader can't win fair and \nsquare, he is proposing to break the rules in the middle of the game.\n  We have heard them make every argument in an attempt to disguise \ntheir raw abuse of power. They even claim the Constitution prohibits \nSenators from filibustering judicial nominees. But as Senator Frist, \nthe majority leader, admitted on the floor recently, that's nowhere in \nthe Constitution. Certainly the Republicans didn't believe that when \nthey were filibustering President Clinton's nominees--including when \nSenator Frist, himself joined in a filibuster of a circuit court \nnominee in 2000.\n  This misreading of the Constitution and Senate rules is the same kind \nof distortion we have seen from the nominees they support.\n  We have seen it in Priscilla Owen's opinions twisting the law in an \nattempt to deny the insurance claim of a heart surgery patient, or to \nexempt campaign contributors from environmental regulations. We have \nseen it in Janice Rogers Brown's twisting the Constitution to claim job \ndiscrimination laws can't protect Latino workers from ethnic slurs in \nthe workplace. We have seen it in William Pryor's opposition to basic \nprotections for the disabled, voting rights, and family and medical \nleave--views rejected by the Supreme Court. And we've seen it in \nWilliam Myers' opinion that cleared the way for an open-pit mine on \nland sacred to Native Americans--an opinion that a Federal court later \nsaid ignored ``well-established canons of statutory construction.''\n  These nominees do not deserve lifetime appointments to the federal \ncourts, where they have enormous power over the American people.\n  More importantly, the Senate does not deserve the bitter legacy we \nwould leave if we adopt the nuclear option. It is not worth running \nroughshod over the traditions of this institution for short-term \npolitical gain. It is not worth turning our backs on our constitutional \nrole as a check and balance on Presidential appointments to the courts.\n  Alexander Hamilton said this about the need for the Senate to be an \nindependent check on the President's nominations.\n  ``To what purpose [do we] require the co-operation of the Senate? . . \n. It would be an excellent check upon a spirit of favoritism in the \nPresident, and would tend greatly to prevent the appointment of unfit \ncharacters.''\n  That's what Alexander Hamilton said the Senate should be--a check \nagainst overreaching by the President, not a rubber stamp for the \nPresident. I urge my colleagues to remember that as United States \nSenators, we are the keepers of a constitutional trust that is not ours \nto give away. That trust belongs to the American people. The system of \nchecks and balances protects them. If we give away that trust, we will \nnever get it back.\n  What we are witnessing in this debate is an arrogant power grab by \nthe Republican right. This is what happens when the rightwing of the \nRepublican Party calls the tune for the Republican Party as a whole. We \nare spending days and weeks debating five rightwing judges, but not 5 \nminutes on what counts most in people's lives--not 5 minutes on secure \njobs, or healthy families, or educational opportunity. Those are not \nthe values and priorities we see today from this White House and this \nRepublican Congress.\n\n[[Page S5483]]\n\n  To them, history doesn't matter. Mainstream values don't matter. Our \ncommitment to working families doesn't matter. What the Republican \nParty cares about today is putting a rightwing agenda ahead of \nmainstream values, corporate interests ahead of the public interest, \nand the agenda of the privileged few ahead of the American dream for \nall.\n  We have approved 208 of George Bush's nominees to the federal courts. \nTwo hundred eight. But the five right wing judicial nominees at stake \nin the nuclear option have no business making life-or-death, make-or-\nbreak decisions that affect our lives. They are anti-worker, anti-civil \nrights, anti-disability, anti-senior, anti-consumer, and anti-\nenvironment.\n  This is President Bush's moment of truth too. Instead of fanning the \nright wing flames, the President can end this abuse of power. He can \npick judges closer to the center, not from the outer edge.\n  We as Senators have a choice as well. We can break the rules and run \nroughshod over our constitutional system of checks and balances, or we \ncan seek accommodation and compromise for the good of our democracy and \nthe strength of our Nation. The one thing standing between The White \nHouse and total control of Congress and the courts is the Senate's \nright to full and fair debate.\n  I urge the President, I urge the Republican leadership in the Senate, \nto heed the timeless words of the prophet Micah who wrote, ``What is \ngood and what does the Lord require of you but to do justice, and to \nlove kindness, and to walk humbly with your God?''\n  Here are some of the rules and precedents that the executive will \nhave to ask its allies in the Senate to break or ignore, in order to \nturn the Senate into a rubber stamp for nominations:\n  First, they will have to see that the Vice President himself is \npresiding over the Senate, so that no real Senator needs to endure the \nembarrassment of publicly violating the Senate's rules and precedents \nand overriding the Senate Parliamentarian, the way our Presiding \nOfficer will have to do;\n  Next, they will have to break paragraph 1 of rule V, which requires 1 \nday's specific written notice if a Senator intends to try to suspend or \nchange any rule;\n  Then they will have to break paragraph 2 of rule V, which provides \nthat the Senate rules remain in force from Congress to Congress, unless \nthey are changed in accordance with the existing rules;\n  Then they will have to break paragraph 2 of rule XXII, which requires \na motion signed by 16 Senators, a 2-day wait and a \\3/5\\ vote to close \ndebate on the nomination itself;\n  They will also have to break rule XXII's requirement of a petition, a \nwait, and a \\2/3\\ vote to stop debate on a rules change;\n  Then, since they pretend to be proceeding on a constitutional basis, \nthey will have to break the invariable rule of practice that \nconstitutional issues must not be decided by the Presiding Officer but \nmust be referred by the Presiding officer to the entire Senate for full \ndebate and decision;\n  Throughout the process they will have to ignore, or intentionally \ngive incorrect answers to, proper parliamentary inquiries which, if \nanswered in good faith and in accordance with the expert advice of the \nParliamentarian, would make clear that they are breaking the rules;\n  Eventually, when their repeated rule-breaking is called into \nquestion, they will blatantly, and in dire violation of the norms and \nmutuality of the Senate, try to ignore the minority leader and other \nSenators who are seeking recognition to make lawful motions or pose \nlegitimate inquiries or make proper objections.\n  By this time, all pretense of comity, all sense of mutual respect and \nfairness, all of the normal courtesies that allow the Senate to proceed \nexpeditiously on any business at all will have been destroyed by the \npre-emptive Republican nuclear strike on the Senate floor.\n  To accomplish their goal of using a bare majority vote to escape the \nrule requiring 60 votes to cut off debate, those participating in this \ncharade will, even before the vote, already have terminated the normal \nfunctioning of the Senate. They will have broken the Senate compact of \ncomity, and will have launched a preemptive nuclear war. The battle \nbegins when the perpetrators openly, intentionally and repeatedly, \nbreak clear rules and precedents of the Senate, refuse to follow the \nadvice of the Parliamentarian, and commit the unpardonable sin of \nrefusing to recognize the minority leader.\n  Their hollow defenses to all these points demonstrate the weakness of \ntheir case.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority has 1 hour 50 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BYRD. I wonder how much time the minority will give to me?\n  I shall proceed.\n  Mr. President, today I wish to speak about the history of freedom of \nspeech in the Senate, about the cloture rule which, when invoked, \nlimits debate, a bit about the background here that might help all \nSenators if they care to read or listen, and the people out there who \nare listening, help them to understand a little more about what this is \nall about.\n  It is a matter of very great interest to the country and to the \nRepublicans and to Democrats and to independents, to people from all \nwalks of life. It is in that spirit that I seek to talk just a little \nwhile about this subject which is of great concern. I hope to have more \nto say on another day, but today I will limit myself to talking about \nthe background, what this is all about, and the history that brings us \nto where we are today.\n  In recognition that the duty imposed on the President faithfully to \nexecute the law requires persons sympathetic to his program, the Senate \ntraditionally has given the President great leeway in choosing his \npolicymaking subordinates, especially those in his Cabinet and those in \nsub-Cabinet positions. The Senate has more or less uniformly followed \nthis practice, as a matter of grace and in the spirit of cooperation, \nto ensure that the executive branch functions as a team in implementing \nand enforcing the laws.\n  What has been the fairly general practice with respect to the \nappointment of executive branch policymakers, however, has not always \napplied to judicial nominations, and the arguments to the contrary are \nat odds with the separation of powers doctrine, common sense and \nhistory.\n  The Constitution establishes a Supreme Court and gives Congress the \npower, in its discretion, to constitute inferior tribunals; nowhere in \nthe blueprint of our Government is it hinted--is it even hinted; \nnowhere is it even hinted--that the high Court or any other Federal \ncourt is the President's court.\n\n  Some may say, well, the President should have his own Cabinet. He \nshould have his Cabinet. He should be able to choose his Cabinet. And \nthere is considerable weight to be given to that point of view. But I \ndo not think that any of us should maintain that the President is \nentitled to have his own court. That is the point.\n  So nothing in the Constitution suggests that either the Justices or \nthe judges should be the President's men. Let me say that again. \nNothing in the Constitution suggests that either the Justices or judges \nshould be the President's men or women, as it were. In fact, the \nConstitution refutes this notion by granting Federal judges lifetime \ntenure and by making their compensation inviolable.\n  The men who met in Philadelphia in that hot summer of 1787 were \npractical statesmen. They were experienced in politics, statesmen who \nviewed the principle of separation of powers as a vital check against \ntyranny. And so I ask, can a rubber stamp be ``a vital check against \ntyranny''? If the Framers had intended the Senate simply to endorse the \nPresident's selections, the Senate could have been left out of the \nprocess altogether. Clearly, the men who met at Philadelphia, nearly \n219 years ago, had in mind a more substantive role for the Senate.\n  The Senate has more than once flexed its political muscles to reject \na Presidential nominee, including the rejection or withdrawal of 15 \nCabinet nominations and 26 Supreme Court nominations. Confirmation \npower is one of the major constitutional provisions that separates the \nSenate from\n\n[[Page S5484]]\n\nthe other body, the House of Representatives. It has been the subject \nof numerous articles, books, novels, and even motion pictures.\n  As early as Henry IV, who reigned from 1399 to 1413, English \nParliaments effectively controlled the King's royal council and \nhousehold. Several officials of Henry IV's household were dismissed at \nthe insistence of the House of Commons. Both the household officials \nand the members of ``the great and continual council'' were named in \nParliament.\n  So I say to the distinguished Senator from Tennessee, who presently \npresides over the Senate, with a degree of aplomb and grace and dignity \nthat is so rare as a day in June, that the Senate routinely debated \nnominations in closed session in the beginning.\n  John Tyler was the first Vice President to become President on the \ndeath of the incumbent. Early in the Tyler administration, President \nTyler broke with the Whig majority in the Senate, which thereafter \nfrustrated his efforts to appoint his own supporters to office. Nothing \nin the Senate's history has ever, ever matched the spectacle that \noccurred on March 3, 1843, the last day of the Senate's session, when \nPresident Tyler came to the Capitol, just down the hall, to sign \nlegislation and to submit last-minute nominations.\n  Tyler nominated Caleb Cushing to be Secretary of the Treasury, not \nonce, not twice, but three times that night. Are you listening? Three \ntimes. And each time, the Senate rejected Cushing by an even larger \nmargin than before, the votes being, as recorded in the Senate \nExecutive Journal, 19 for to 27 against, then 10 for to 27 against, and \non the third time, 2 for Caleb Cushing and 29 against.\n  Three times President Tyler named Henry A. Wise to be Minister to \nFrance--that same evening--and Wise, too, was thrice rejected.\n  Senator Thomas Hart Benton reported that ``nominations and rejections \nflew backwards and forwards in a game of shuttlecock.'' In all--in \nall--the Senate turned down four of President Tyler's Cabinet nominees: \nin addition to Cushing, David Henshaw as Secretary of the Navy, James \nM. Porter as Secretary of War, and James S. Green as Secretary of the \nTreasury. And that ain't all. The Senate turned down four of President \nTyler's nominees to the Supreme Court: John C. Spencer, Reuben H. \nWalworth, Edward King, and John M. Read. It is a record of rejection \nunmatched--unmatched--by any other President. What a spectacle.\n  ``History,'' wrote the poet Byron, ``with all her volumes vast, hath \nbut one page.'' Byron was saying there that history does repeat itself, \nso it only needs one page.\n  We should do well, then, Mr. President, to look backward into the \npast where we shall find that due diligence by the Senate in fulfilling \nits ``advice and consent'' responsibility in the appointment process \nhas been, in Hamilton's words, ``an efficacious source of stability'' \nin the Government of the Republic.\n  Mr. President, in his Manual of Parliamentary Practice, Thomas \nJefferson quoted ``Mr. Onslow, the ablest among the Speakers of the \nHouse of Commons,'' as follows. Here is what Mr. Onslow had to say:\n       It was a maxim he had often heard when he was a young man, \n     from old and experienced Members--\nlike myself--\n\n     that nothing tended more to throw power into the hands of \n     administration, and [into the hands of] those who acted with \n     the majority of the House of Commons, than a neglect of, or \n     departure from, the rules--\n\n``the rules''--\n\n     of proceeding; that these forms, as instituted by our \n     ancestors--\n\nyours and mine--\n\n     operated as a check and control on the actions of the \n     majority, and that they were, in many instances, a shelter \n     and protection to the minority, against the attempts of \n     power.\n  Now, Thomas Jefferson himself wrote that whether the rules of a \nlegislative body:\n\n     . . . be in all cases the most rational or not is really not \n     of so great importance. It is much more material that there \n     should be a rule to go by than what that rule is; that there \n     may be a uniformity of proceeding in business not subject to \n     the caprice of the Speaker or captiousness of the members. It \n     is very material that order, decency and regularity be \n     preserved in a dignified public body.\n\n  Therefore, Mr. President, all legislative bodies need rules to follow \nif they are to transact business in an orderly fashion, and if they are \nto operate fairly--I have heard that word used a good bit here--\nefficiently, and expeditiously.\n  On April 7, 1789, the day after a quorum of Senators had appeared--so \nyou see the Senate just goes back to April 6, 1789--a special committee \nwas created to ``prepare a system of rules for conducting business.'' \nThe committee consisted of Senators Oliver Ellsworth of Connecticut, \nRichard Henry Lee of Virginia, Caleb Strong of Massachusetts, William \nMaclay of Pennsylvania, and Richard Bassett of Delaware. All five of \nthese committee members were lawyers. Each had served in his State \nlegislature, the procedures of which were indebted to colonial and \nEnglish experience. Two had served in the Continental Congress, which \nwas also indebted to colonial and English precedents, and three had \nparticipated in the Constitutional Convention, whose members had \ncreated the Senate.\n  Obstructive tactics--we have heard a lot about that lately--in a \nlegislative forum, although not always known as filibusters, are of \nancient origin. Plutarch reported that when Caesar returned to Rome \nafter his sojourn in Spain, his arrival happened at the time of the \nelection of consuls. ``He applied to the Senate for permission to stand \ncandidate,'' but Cato--Cato the Younger--strongly opposed his request \nand ``attempted to prevent his success by gaining time; with which view \nhe spun out the debate till it was too late to conclude anything that \nday.''\n  The sun went down. That ended the debate.\n  Filibusters were also a problem in the British Parliament. In 19th \ncentury England, even the members of the Cabinet accepted the tactics \nof obstruction as an appropriate weapon to defeat House of Commons \ninitiatives that were not acceptable to the government.\n  Now, in this country, I say to the Presiding Officer and the \ndistinguished Senator from Tennessee and my other colleagues, \nexperience with protracted debate began early. In the first session of \nthe First Congress--that is going back quite a ways. I have only lived \none-fourth of all the time that has transpired since that First \nCongress convened. But in the first session of the First Congress, for \nexample, there was a lengthy discussion regarding the permanent site \nfor the location for the capital. How about that. Fisher Ames, a Member \nof the House from Massachusetts, complained that ``the minority . . . \nmake every exertion to . . . delay the business.'' That is what we are \ntalking about. That sounds like a filibuster, doesn't it? Senator \nWilliam Maclay of Pennsylvania complained that ``every endeavor was \nused to waste time.''\n  That sounds like a filibuster, doesn't it? Well, long speeches and \nother obstructionist tactics were more characteristic of the House than \nof the Senate in the early years. So it started over there. But the \nHouse, on February 27, 1811, ``decided . . . that after previous \nquestion was decided in the affirmative, the main question should not \nbe debated.'' So there you have it. They moved the previous question. \nThat still is done in the other body. The practice of limiting debate \ndates back to 1604--my, that is over 400 years; that is 401 years--when \nSir Henry Vane first introduced the idea in the British Parliament. \nKnown in parliamentary procedure as the ``previous question,'' it is \ndescribed in section XXXIV of Jefferson's Manual of Parliamentary \nPractice, as follows. Here is the way Thomas Jefferson explained the \nprevious question:\n\n       When any question is before the House, any Member may move \n     a previous question . . . --\n\n  That is the way it is done over in the House, Mr. President: Mr. \nSpeaker, I move the previous question--\n     whether that question (called the main question) shall now be \n     put.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, they say in the House: I move the previous question.\n  Jefferson went on to say:\n\n       If it pass in the affirmative, then the main question to be \n     put immediately, and no man may speak anything further to it, \n     either to add or alter.\n\n  That is Thomas Jefferson speaking through his writing. The journals \nof the Continental Congress record that the previous question was used \nin 1778. Get that. This is the Continental Congress. When did it first \nmeet? It first\n\n[[Page S5485]]\n\nmet in 1774, the First Continental Congress. So the journals of the \nContinental Congress record that the previous question was used in \n1778. Section 10 of the rules of the Continental Congress read:\n\n       While a question is before the House, no motion shall be \n     received, unless for an amendment, for the previous question, \n     to postpone the consideration of the main question, or to \n     commit to.\n\n  The rules adopted by the Senate in April 1789 included a motion for \nthe previous question. According to historian George H. Haynes, when \nVice President Aaron Burr delivered his farewell address to the Senate \nin March 1805--200 years ago--he, Aaron Burr, the Vice President of the \nUnited States, ``recommended the discarding of the previous question,'' \nbecause in the preceding 4 years during which he had presided over the \nSenate, it had ``been taken but once, and then upon an amendment.''\n  So, Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Tennessee, who is \npresiding, and other Senators, when the rules of the Senate were \ncodified in 1806--that was the first revision of the rules, in 1806--\nreference to the previous question was omitted. The previous question \nallowed the Senate to terminate debate: Mr. President, I move the \nprevious question. Or in the House: Mr. Speaker, I move the previous \nquestion. If that gained a majority, no further debate. The previous \nquestion will be voted on.\n  In 1806, when the rules of the Senate were first codified, reference \nto the previous question was omitted. Since then it had only been used \n10 times from the years 1789 to 1806, and it has never--it has never, \nit has never--been restored.\n  Henry Clay, in 1841, proposed the introduction of the previous \nquestion. Here we have Henry Clay proposing that they bring back the \nprevious question. But he abandoned the idea in the face of opposition. \nThose Senators did not want the previous question. They did not want to \nterminate debate. They wanted freedom of speech.\n  When the Oregon bill was being considered in 1846, a unanimous \nconsent agreement was used as a way to limit debate by setting a date \nfor a vote.\n  When Senator Stephen Douglas proposed permitting the use of the \nprevious question in 1850, the idea encountered substantial opposition \nand was dropped--dropped, dropped. They did not want the previous \nquestion. They did not want to terminate debate. They wanted to be able \nto speak on and on and on. A filibuster? Well, perhaps.\n  An effort to reinstitute the previous question on March 19, 1873, \nfailed by a vote of 25 for to 30 against.\n  The final impetus for a cloture rule came as a result of a 1917 \nfilibuster, one of the most famous in the Senate annals--against an \nadministration measure permitting the arming of American merchant \nvessels for the duration of the World War. I believe that was 1915.\n  On February 26, President Wilson--I was born during one of the \nadministrations of Woodrow Wilson--President Wilson appeared before a \njoint session of Congress to request legislation authorizing the arming \nof merchant ships. The President announced that the rules of the Senate \nwould have to be revised--now get this--the rules of the Senate would \nhave to be revised before he would call a special session of the entire \nCongress to deal with the war emergency. And so, Mr. President, the \nfate of the unlimited debate was sealed.\n  The principal responsibility for the cloture resolution rested with \nthe new Democratic majority leader, Thomas Martin of Virginia. Under \nhis guidance, a bipartisan committee of the Senate's leaders drew up a \nproposal providing that a vote--get this--by two-thirds of those \npresent and voting could invoke cloture on a pending measure. Two-\nthirds of those present and voting.\n  By a vote of 76 to 3 on March 8, 1917, after only 6 hours of debate, \nthe Senate adopted its first cloture rule. Mr. President, 1917, that \nwas the year in which I was born.\n  In 1949 now, President Harry S. Truman sought to clear the way for a \nbroad civil rights program, and his first step was to push for \nliberalization of the cloture rule. His efforts produced a bitter \nbattle at the beginning of the 81st Congress.\n  The Senate adopted a compromise measure that proved to be less usable \nthan the one it replaced. It required that two-thirds of this entire \nSenate vote for cloture rather than two-thirds of those present and \nvoting. That was 1949. The new rule differed from the old in that it \nallowed cloture to operate on any pending business or motion, with the \nexception of debate on rules change. This meant that future efforts to \nchange the cloture rule would themselves be subject to extended debate \nwithout benefit of the cloture provision.\n  Now we are getting down into my time. At the beginning of the 86th \nCongress--I came to Congress during the 83rd Congress when Harry Truman \nwas getting close to the end of his tenure--at the beginning of the \n86th Congress, Senate majority leader, Lyndon B. Johnson, offered and \nthe Senate adopted by a 72-to-22 rollcall vote, a resolution to amend \nSenate rule XXII. Approved on January 12, 1959, after 4 days of debate, \nthe resolution permitted two-thirds of the Senators present and \nvoting--going back to the very beginning of the cloture rule--two-\nthirds of the Senators present and voting to close debate, even on \nproposals for rules change. It also added to rule XXII:\n\n       The rules of the Senate shall continue from one Congress to \n     the next Congress unless they are changed and provided in \n     these rules.\n\n  These rules, these rules in this book, the ``Senate Manual.''\n  On February 28, 1975, I submitted a resolution providing that debate \nin the Senate be closed by a vote of three-fifths of the Senators duly \nchosen and sworn, except in the case of a measure or motion to change \nthe rules of the Senate, when a two-thirds vote of Senators present and \nvoting would be required to close debate.\n  On March 7, 1975, the Senate adopted my substitute providing that \nthree-fifths of all Senators chosen and sworn could invoke cloture. \nThis provision applied to all measures except those amending the rules \nof the Senate which still required a two-thirds vote of Senators \npresent and voting.\n  Four years later on February 22, 1979, the Senate agreed to a \nresolution that I submitted establishing a cap of 100 hours of \nconsideration once cloture had been invoked on a measure.\n  Under my resolution, each Senator would be entitled to 1 hour of \ntime. Senators could yield their time to the majority or minority floor \nmanagers of the bill or to the majority or minority leaders. Except by \nunanimous consent, none of the designated four Senators could have more \nthan 2 additional hours yielded to him or to her. These Senators in \nturn could yield their time to other Senators. If all available time \nexpired, a Senator who had not yielded time and who had not yet spoken \non the matter on which cloture had been invoked could be recognized for \n10 minutes for the sole purpose of debate.\n  The 1979 resolution made in order only those first-degree amendments \nsubmitted by 1 p.m. the day following submission of a cloture motion, \nwith second-degree amendments in order only if submitted in writing 1 \nhour prior to the beginning of the cloture vote.\n  The substitute amendment contained the current overall limitation of \n30 hours of consideration after cloture has been invoked.\n  So that brings us up to the present day rules with reference to \ndebate and limitation of debate in the Senate, the current cloture \nrule. That puts us where we are now, and I thought it would be well \njust to review briefly the history of unlimited debate in the Senate \nand then the cloture rule limiting debate--the cloture rule as \ninitially adopted requiring two-thirds of those present and voting; and \nthen in 1949, two-thirds of those elected and sworn; and then again in \n1975, two-thirds of those Members present and voting, that is where we \nare--so that we might have this basis for a better understanding of \nwhere we go from here.\n  I thank you, Mr. President. I thank all Senators, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and I thank the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia for his extraordinary analysis \nand understanding of the Constitution which he has constantly been the \nkeeper of in the Senate.\n\n[[Page S5486]]\n\n  We are in a remarkable moment of confrontation. This is a great \ninstitution, or at least it always has been, and it is looked up to by \npeople all over the world. Caught up as we are now in this moment of \npartisan ideological division of a raw reach for power, the Congress \nitself is daily dropping in its regard by the American people. Rather \nthan reaching across the aisle to grapple with the real crises that \nface our Nation, the Republican leadership keeps moving unilaterally to \nchange the way this institution has worked, and not for the better.\n  Those of us who have had the privilege of being here for some period \nof time--I have been here for 22 years; Senator Byrd has been here \nalmost 50; Senator Kennedy, Senator Stevens, and others have also \nserved for a significant period of time--but brief as my stay has been, \nI find myself now I think No. 18 in seniority, which means 82 Senators \nhave come and gone during the time I have been here. I have had a \nchance to know many of them going back to the time of Barry Goldwater, \nJohn Stennis, Russell Long, and others. Never in that whole period of \ntime I have served have I ever seen this institution behaving the way \nit does today.\n  Colleagues who came to do the same good as colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle, locked out of conference committees, hearings that \ndo not take place when they ought to; oversight that does not occur as \nit used to. This institution is being damaged daily by the \npartisanship, the bitter ideological divide that is preventing good \npeople on both sides of the aisle from doing good business for the \nAmerican people; from finding real solutions to the real problems of \nreal concern to average families all across our country, who cannot pay \ntheir health care bills, who are losing jobs abroad, who worry about \nthe twin deficits of the budget of our country and of our trade; who \nsee extraordinary threats to community as kids do not get the education \nthey ought to. All this time we have been spending weeks, if not \nmonths, caught up discussing a nuclear option, discussing a few judges \nout of the two hundred, 208 or so, who have been nominated and approved \nby this President.\n  The Senate is now watching this struggle take place, countless hours \nconsumed by an effort to change the rules by breaking the rules. If my \ncolleagues want to change the rules, use the rules to change the rules. \nDo not subvert the system. Do not play a cute parliamentary game that \nhas been untouched over 200 years.\n  This is a stunning moment. The problem is that words spoken in this \nChamber do not even fully convey the importance of this moment. This \nis, in fact, one of those times the Founding Fathers and countless \nother statesmen of history have warned us against.\n  Henry Clay said: The arts of power and its minions are the same in \nall countries and in all ages. It marks its victim, denounces it and \nexcites the public odium and the public hatred to conceal its own \nabuses and encroachments.\n  James Madison said: Where the whole power of one department is \nexercised by the same hands which possess the whole power of another \ndepartment, the fundamental principles of a free constitution are \nsubverted. . . . The accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive \nand judiciary, in the same hands, whether of one, a few or many, and \nwhether hereditary, self-appointed or elective, may justly be \npronounced the very definition of tyranny.\n  What we are going to see if this happens is the judiciary of the \nUnited States entirely put into the hands of the Presidency, period. \nThe advice and consent will be wiped out, barring displays of courage \nthat we have not seen recently, because people will come, as they did \nin our committee most recently, to say, well, we just had an election \nand the President won and the President has the right to his \nappointments, that is it, end of issue. Gone, the divisions; gone, the \ntest; gone, the judgment we were supposed to apply as a separate and \ncoequal branch of Government.\n  That is what the Founding Fathers wrote. They did not give the \nPresident the ability to have whoever that President wants. That is \nwhat is written into the Constitution, that every single one of us went \nto the well of this body and raised our hands and swore to uphold.\n  We did not swear to uphold the majority leader. We did not swear to \nuphold the President. We did not swear to uphold our party. We swore to \nuphold the Constitution of the United States, and that is our duty.\n  Lord Acton said it maybe best: All power corrupts. Absolute power \ncorrupts absolutely.\n  Thomas Jefferson said: I hope our wisdom will grow with our power and \nteach us that the less we use our power the greater it will be.\n  If my colleagues want to use the power of ending a filibuster, just \nhave the filibuster for week after week and let people stand up and \nmake their arguments. If the arguments have no currency, believe me, \nbetween the press, public opinion, the bloggers, and C-SPAN, this \ncountry will rise up and they will get their 60 votes if they deserve \nthem. That is an up-or-down vote of its own kind.\n  If it were compelling enough, as it was with the Civil Rights Act, or \ncompelling enough as it has been in other great confrontations in this \nbody, we have always found our way to make it happen. We have always \ndone it without the rules. We are a Nation that has listened to some \nremarkable men and women in remarkable debates about how we as a Nation \nare different in balancing power and protecting the people and the \ninstitutions that we set up to protect the people. We are not here as \nan institution to protect an ideology. We are not here as an \ninstitution to protect a party. We are here to protect collectively the \nGovernment of the United States of America that is made up of those \nbrilliant words that were fought over so diligently and remarkably in \nPhiladelphia and which have served us so well all of these years.\n  Now all of a sudden in 2005, feeling the flush of victory in an \nelection that was close, controlling two branches of Government, \nelected officials, people who serve at the grace of that Constitution \nfor a brief period of time, at the sufferance of the people who vote \nfor us, those people are choosing to serve the moment, not to serve \nhistory, not to serve precedent, not to serve common sense, not to \nserve even the real interests of the American people, but to serve a \nnarrowly defined, elected, official, leadership-determined, ideological \npurpose.\n  I believe the real interests of Americans are best served by \nremembering that the greatest strength and the greatest virtue of our \ndemocracy is not that it gives power to the majority, which is easy to \nexercise, easy to understand, easy to abuse; the great virtue of the \nAmerican system of Government and of our democracy is the protection it \nprovides to the minority. That is what is special about America. That \nis what makes us different from everybody else. That is what lives are \nbeing lost for, to tell people in Iraq and Afghanistan, this is what \nyou ought to embrace--the full measure of democracy, not some limited \ntricky little measure where, in the flush of victory, you change the \nrules.\n\n  What would we say about this if it was another country that we had \nhelped to be the country they are, embracing our democracy, but they \nstarted to play those kinds of games and there was suddenly an abuse of \nrules that had been set up that everybody understood were there to make \nthe democracy work effectively?\n  It is precisely the protection of the minority that makes our \ndemocracy so respected and so awesome to people all over this planet.\n  This is a dangerous time for our democracy. What is at stake here is \nsomething far greater than the confirmation of a few judges. Let there \nbe no doubt that line was drawn clearly here this morning because the \ndeputy leader offered to have four judges confirmed. We could have \nconfirmed four judges right here, today, this morning.\n  No, no, no. This is a division. This is a moment of confrontation \nbeing sought by the leadership on the other side of the aisle. What is \nat stake is something far greater than any of the individual judges. It \nis defined by the refusal to accept the offer to do those judges today. \nWe could have gotten the President's percentage up from 95 to whatever, \n98 percent. But, no, we do not want that. That will change the focus.\n  No matter how much time is spent on the life story of Priscilla Owen, \nwe all\n\n[[Page S5487]]\n\nknow the choice of this particular judgeship and of just staying on \nthis judgeship and not trying to have other judgeships represents, in \nfact, a choice. It is a smokescreen for what this fight is really all \nabout. It is not about these few judges. We could have confirmed those \njudges. But the Republican leadership is fundamentally determined to \ndeny the minority the right to hold the Executive accountable for such \njudgments as we might make about the lifetime appointment of those \njudges.\n  I heard both sides out here. Some Members of our side did call for \nup-or-down votes when that was the argument that best served them. But, \nguess what, when they didn't get it, they didn't call for a change in \nthe rules, and they did not try to break the rules to change the rules. \nThey used their best argument, but they respected the institution.\n  That is not what is happening today. So we can forget about who said \nwhat when. The real fight is about the Senate. The real fight is about \nthe Constitution. The real fight is about who we are and what kind of \ncountry we are going to be and how we behave and what kind of example \nwe set to young kids in school today who read the history books and \ndream someday of being a Senator and perhaps joining the world's \ngreatest deliberative body.\n  This is about George Bush and Karl Rove and the Republican leadership \nand their quest for absolute control over who goes to the Supreme Court \nand to the judgeships across this country. This is about carrying, \nbeyond this branch of Government, power into another branch of \nGovernment that is supposed to be separate. This is about the \ngratification of immediate ideological goals and the pursuit of power, \nregardless of the long-term consequences to the Senate, the Congress, \nor the Constitution of the country. To get what they want, the \nleadership has acquiesced to outside forces. Not even the precedents \nand history and quality of this institution are guiding them. It is an \noutside hand.\n  As John Danforth, with whom many of us had the privilege of serving \nhere, a greatly respected former Republican Senator--he was George \nBush's choice as a special envoy to Darfur. He was George Bush's choice \nto go to the United Nations. He is, above all, as all of us know, a man \nof enormous faith, a respected minister, and a leader in his church. \nHere is what he wrote a few weeks ago:\n\n       The problem is not with people or churches that are \n     politically active. It is with a party that has gone so far \n     in adopting a sectarian agenda that it has become the \n     political extension of a religious movement.\n\n  So spoke Senator John Danforth, Republican.\n  Yet, despite Senator Danforth's warning, most of my colleagues stay \nright on script in this fight for history, this fight for principle, \nand this fight for rights. On script, they allow our cherished \nprinciples to be abused and glossed over as the debate sort of develops \nor drops down into a competition of hollow sound bites. But script and \nsound bite are not what should dictate what happens here, not in the \nSenate. Conscience and principle ought to dictate what happens here. \nThere have to be Senators prepared to stand up and do their duty as \nU.S. Senators, not Senators of their party.\n  My distinguished colleague, Senator Voinovich, recently showed \ncourage in the Foreign Relations Committee when he suddenly stopped the \nproceedings of the committee and he said: I am not comfortable with \nwhat is happening here. My conscience tells me we ought to stop and \ntake a better look.\n  Guess what happened. He was vilified on talk radio and in certain \npartisan circles for having gone off script.\n  Senator Chafee of Rhode Island, 4 years here, stands up and says: \nWow, that is the first time in 4 years I have ever seen anybody do \nthat.\n  What? The first time in 4 years a Senator saw another Senator stop \nand think for himself and exercise conscience and go off script? What \nkind of statement is that about what has happened here? It is not \ncontroversial, my friends. It is a sad statement about the Senate, and \nit underscores what is happening here now.\n  Independence and conscience and principle are really what is at stake \nhere, the independence of the Senate, the independence of the judiciary \nfrom an administration that is just hell-bent for leather determined to \nget its way. Heavens knows what leverage will be exerted in these next \nhours as we see so much on the table, with military bases closing and \nother issues--who knows? Independence of the Senate, a special \ninstitution in our Government, a place where things purposefully slow \ndown, where they find their balance--that is what the Senate was \ncreated for.\n\n  It is surprising and disturbing that members of the Republican \nleadership know what is at stake, but they have actually worked with \nthe Republican administration to spreads things that aren't true. I \ndon't know what happened to truth around here. I don't know what \nhappened to truth in the discussion of great issues before this \ncountry.\n  But the truth is, in the end, none of the constitutional issues that \nhave been put forward--and today's Republican leadership--none of them \nstand up. They do not stand scrutiny. They are hollow, tortured, poll-\ntested statements. The whole argument about the Constitution and up-or-\ndown votes or ``unprecedented''--the word ``unprecedented'' has been \nused. They sound good, but they are not true, and we know it. Yet \nSenators continue to fall in line, turning out the script, turning out \nthe phases that have to be repeated. It is not a true representation of \nthe Constitution, of history, or the rights of Senators.\n  Personally, I believe there would be a lot more outrage in the Nation \nand in the media if the value of truth had not been so diminished over \nthe last years. We have a budget that comes trillions of dollars short \nof counting every dollar we plan to spend, but, oh no, there is no \naccountability. We have a budget that doesn't even count the interest \non the debt. Find me an accountant in a business in America who doesn't \nput the interest on the debt that they owe in the accounting, and they \nwould be fired. We do not do it. No accountability.\n  We have had a Medicare actuary who was forced at risk of losing his \njob to lie about what the costs would be of a prescription drug bill \nand lie to the Congress. No accountability. We have had falsified \nnumbers in Iraq, on everything from the cost of the war to the number \nof troops that have been trained to the slam dunk on intelligence--no \naccountability. We have an administration that continues to want to \nfund fake newscasts paid for by the American people, without \ndisclaimer, and mislead people across America.\n  In fact, the administration's willingness to consistently abandon the \ntruth I think has done great damage to the American people's \nwillingness to believe anything any of us say. They are less willing to \nlisten. They are less willing to trust or take anything said seriously.\n  Now we find ourselves in a struggle between a great political \ntradition in the United States that seeks to find the common ground, do \nthe common good, and we have a new ethic on any given issue, where any \nmeans justifies the ends of victory no matter what. It is a new view \nthat says, if you don't like the facts, just change them. If you can't \nwin by playing by the rules, just rewrite them. Witness what happened \nwith Tom DeLay.  The new view says if you can't win a debate on the \nstrength of your arguments, then go ahead and demonize your opponents \nregardless of whether it is true. The new view says it is okay to \nignore the overwhelming public interest as long as you can get away \nwith it.\n\n  This time the Republican leadership has gone the farthest to get away \nwith it, hoping to convince Americans that by breaking the Senate \nrules, they are actually acting to defend the Constitution, honor the \nwords of our Founding Fathers, and avert a judicial crisis.\n  This debate is not fueled by an effort to protect the Constitution. \nIt is fueled by ideology. It is not fueled by a shortage of judges on \nthe bench because, as the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee has \nmade clear, we have the best record of appointing them and the lowest \nvacancies in years.\n  The facts have been repeatedly cleared up, again and again, and \nrepeatedly they are brushed aside with the old adage that if you throw \nenough mud and you repeat something that is not true enough, enough \npeople may come to believe it. Over 95 percent of all judges already \napproved. I have been here since 1985 and I have probably voted for a \nthousand judges. I\n\n[[Page S5488]]\n\nhave not counted them all. For Ronald Reagan, for George Herbert Walker \nBush, for President George Bush. What have we got? Ten who have not \nbeen confirmed?\n  The Bush administration and their allies in Congress hope to get away \nwith this by selling words to the public on a ``team'' the public would \nnever buy if there was a referee who put real facts in front of the \nAmerican people. Unfortunately, words with great meaning--Constitution, \nFounding Fathers, history, precedent--all of these are being twisted \nand cheated of their full meaning and of their full import in the \nprocess.\n  In the end, the American people are being underestimated by this \nadministration. They may work their will here; I don't know yet. We do \nnot know. Certainly they have a lot of cards to play. But in the end, \nAmericans value the Constitution, and over time this will be felt. In \nthe end, Americans understand that the strength of our democracy is \nbest judged by the enduring strength of our minority and its ability to \nbe heard. And Americans cherish the ability of the minority to be \nheard.\n  When Americans first heard the term ``nuclear option,'' they kind of \nrecoiled--appropriately. They were confident that dismantling the \nfilibuster and silencing the minority would have as catastrophic an \neffect on our democracy as a nuclear blast would on our security. But \nthe majority's action was not to back off and to say, okay, we will \nplay by the rules. The majority's reaction was to change the slogan. So \nin an act of transparent hypocrisy, the minority changed the slogan \nfrom ``nuclear option'' to ``constitutional option.'' George Orwell \nwould be pleased. They embarked on a series of hollow arguments based \non mythical constitutional provisions confident that if you just say \nit, somebody will believe it.\n  You can change the slogan, but you cannot change the fact that \ndiminishing the rights of the minority diminishes the spirit and the \nsubstance of our Constitution and the foundation of our Government. \nArgument after argument put forward by the Bush Republican leadership \nis just plain false. False. I have heard it argued that our \nConstitution mandates specific protocol of voting for judges. No. They \nhave used their new catchphrase, up-or-down votes, hundreds of times in \nrecent days. But those words do not appear once in our Constitution. \nThey are not even subliminally in the Constitution in the advice and \nconsent and separateness of power given to the Senate and the right of \nthe Senate to make its own rules.\n  No one should be fooled. Those phrases do not mean constitutional. \nThey do not mean democratic. They do not mean fair. They are phrases \nthat are code for dissent-proof, minority-proof, and filibuster-proof. \nThere is nothing in our Constitution or our history to suggest that the \nnominee of any President is so special as to be excused from the \nscrutiny of the minority or granted immunity from the tools of \ndemocracy that protect that minority.\n\n  I didn't win, but I can guarantee this: Had I been President, I would \nnot have contemplated supporting or sending a request to change what I \nhave viewed as something of value in the entire time I have been here \nin the Senate. Never would have occurred to me. It would have occurred \nto me to send people up here who could win the support of people on \nboth sides. It would have occurred to me to bring the members of the \nJudiciary Committee together and sit them down and work together to \ncome to a common understanding of what sort of standard we ought to \napply and let the American people share that standard.\n  There is nothing in our Constitution or in history to suggest the \nPresident ought to be granted immunity from the tools of democracy. And \nthat is what will happen.\n  My colleagues are well aware that the power of advice and consent is \ngranted to the Senate and the Constitution says absolutely nothing \nabout how the Senate will proceed to provide advice and consent. And \nthe words advice and consent are there in their duality because advice \nis one thing and consent is another. You can withhold your consent or \nyou can give your consent. You can say yes, or you can say nothing if \nyou do not vote. And if you do not vote, you have withheld your \nconsent.\n  It didn't take long before the new Congress exercised its \nconstitutional powers in 1795. Senators who were friends and colleagues \nof the Founders themselves, who surely knew their intent, turned around \nand defeated George Washington's nomination of George Rutledge to be \nthe Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. In 1968, Republican Senator \nRobert Griffin captured the spirit of that event when he said:\n\n       That action in 1795 said to the President then in office \n     and to future presidents, don't expect the Senate to be a \n     rubber stamp. We have an independent and coequal \n     responsibility in the appointing process and we intend to \n     exercise that responsibility as those who drafted the \n     Constitution so clearly intended.\n\n  The Constitution did not mandate a rubberstamp for George Washington \nand the Constitution doesn't mandate a rubberstamp for George Bush \ntoday.\n  In 1795, the rejection of Washington's nominee was heralded as the \nConstitution working, not failing. There is no doubt that an active, \ncoequal partnership was intended. That resounding rejection of George \nWashington, our revolutionary leader, helped to seal the death of the \nmonarchy in this country.\n  The genius of empowering the Senate and the minority was that by \nlimiting the executive, the Senate legitimized the executive. So when I \nhear my colleagues come to the Senate arguing that the Constitution \nmandates the will of the majority always trumps the minority, I don't \nhear the wisdom of our Founding Fathers. I don't see or hear a respect \nfor what happened in 1795. I don't hear the same blind activism that \ncharacterizes the judges they intend to enforce on the Federal bench. \nThe actions of some Senators, in fact, today come closer to rewriting \nthe Constitution than defending it.\n  Another argument we have heard is that the filibuster itself is \nunconstitutional. That has been made. That argument is deeply flawed. \nThe Constitution in Article I, section 5 granted each house the power \nto ``determine the rules of its proceedings.'' That is the Constitution \nof the United States.\n  Every Senator went down there, raised his or her hand, and swore to \ndefend the Constitution. And the Constitution says we have the power to \ndetermine our rules and we have a rule by which we determine the rules, \nand the current rule says you have to have a supermajority to change \nthe rules. But, no, in the flush of victory, in a moment of ideological \nexcess, people are going to come in and change the rule by breaking the \nrule of the Senate that the Constitution itself enshrines. Shame. That \nis a disgrace to the oath and a disgrace to the history and a disgrace \nto what this institution stands for and to the quality of our democracy \nthat we export at the lives of young Americans abroad. It is wrong, \nfundamentally wrong.\n\n  Over the past 200 years, our predecessors in the Senate have taken \nthe role of ``consent'' very seriously. They have created time-tested \nrules to assure the rights of the minorities and to balance the power \nof government. With a hold, a so-called hold, a single Senator can \ndelay a Presidential nominee. A single committee chairman can block a \nnomination by simply refusing to hold hearings.\n  I saw Senator Helms do that any number of times. I tried to get a \nhearing. We tried to get the possibility of a Governor of the United \nStates of America, the Governor of Massachusetts, Bill Weld, nominated \nto be the Ambassador to go to Mexico. Senator Helms: no hearing. \nWouldn't hear of it. It could not happen. Nomination killed.\n  What is this game that is being played back and forth about who said \nwhat, when? We all know how this place has worked all these years. \nThese rules were not created by the Democratic Party when George Bush \nwas elected President. The filibuster was used as early as 1790 by \nSenators from Virginia and South Carolina who filibustered against a \nbill to locate the first Congress in Philadelphia. That was a \nfilibuster of one because in 1790, as Senator Byrd has pointed out, you \nneeded unanimous consent to end the debate. They did change that rule, \nbut they changed that rule by using the rules of the Senate, not by \nbreaking them.\n\n[[Page S5489]]\n\n  Think about it. Those legislators and friends and even the Founders \nthemselves permitted a filibuster of one. Knowing that, today's \nactivist arguments buckle under the weight of history. The unfortunate \ntruth is that some Senators have now fashioned themselves as activist \nlegal scholars using a false reading of the Constitution to paint their \nopponents as obstructionists while pursuing their political agenda at \nthe expense of our democracy.\n  I think some of my colleagues forget that the Senate was designed \nspecifically to be the moderating check on a President. And guess what. \nWe have done unbelievably well as a nation these 200 years. We are the \nenvy of people all across this planet. There is not one of us whose \nheart does not fill with pride, who is not astounded at what we can do \nand have done, and what we can achieve in America, and the stories of \nindividual Senators in this Chamber who have risen from adverse \ncircumstances, and nothing, to be able to represent people in their \nStates. It is a stunning story. It is a story based on that respect for \nthe law and based on the mutual respect that has always guided this \ngreat institution. I think some of my colleagues have lost track of \nthat.\n  My colleagues also forget, as they demonize the filibuster, it has \nbeen a force for the good. Farmers don't forget that. There are a lot \nof farmers in the Midwest in our country. They don't forget when \nSenators from rural States used the filibuster to force Congress to \nrespond to a crisis that left thousands of farmers on the brink of \nbankruptcy in 1985. The big oil companies don't forget it. That don't \nforget when Senators used the filibuster to defeat massive tax \ngiveaways that they were lobbying for in 1981. And I don't forget it, \nwhen, 10 years ago, I came to the floor and filibustered to prevent a \nbill that would have gutted public health and safety and consumer and \nenvironmental protections. That bill never passed, and we know the \ncountry is better for it.\n  Some Senators come to the floor with a practical argument about our \ncourts. They claim that because we have not rubberstamped each and \nevery one of George Bush's nominees, the Nation faces a crisis because \nof a shortage of judges on the bench. It is not true. How can you keep \ncoming to the floor of the Senate saying things that are just plain not \ntrue?\n  Over 95 percent of the President's nominees have been confirmed. Our \ncourts today have the lowest vacancy rate they have had in years. \nEnough of that argument.\n  What is threatened is a delicately balanced system that for 214 years \nsuccessfully prevented the Executive from usurping power that was \ngranted in good faith by the American people. And that threat manifests \nitself in this nuclear option that threatens the character, the core of \nthis institution.\n  The integrity of this Senate is threatened when the majority attempts \nto change the rules by breaking the rules. The balance of power is \nthreatened when the power of advice and consent is gutted. It will be \ngone. Whatever nominees they want will be confirmed, unless you happen \nto find a few people who will stand up to the pressure exerted on their \nStates' need or their reelection need or the other needs that the \nFounding Fathers wanted to protect Senators against.\n  Our democracy is threatened when we set the dangerous precedent that \nminority rights will be silenced at the convenience of the majority. I \nbelieve our courts and the justice this rule is meant to deliver are \nthreatened, in the end, by some of these judges who have been \nnominated.\n  As I said, that is not what this is fundamentally, in the end, about. \nIt is about getting everything you want when you want it.\n  I will wrap up in a moment, Mr. President.\n  Some of my colleagues have argued that Democrats filibuster these \njudges because we simply dislike them or disagree on ideology or \npolicy. Well, there may be some disagreement on things they have said \nor the way they have approached their courts. We saw what Attorney \nGeneral Gonzales has said about Priscilla Owen, that her dissent in In \nre Jane Doe was an ``unconscionable act of judicial activism.'' But the \npoint is, we have confirmed countless judges with whom we disagree on \ncountless issues. If we have confirmed over 200 judges of the President \nof the United States, you know we do not agree with them on many of the \nissues that they brought to the bench, but they brought a fundamental \nfairness or they brought a record that we did not believe ought to be \ndisputed.\n  I think we have shown our good faith on the approach to the \nconfirmation of judges. We have confirmed countless judges because we \nbelieved they were impartial and responsible arbiters of the law. It is \nan activist judge, it is a judge with a particular--many of the \narguments have been made; I am not going to go through them now--but \nthose arguments have been eloquently made with specificity as to these \nfew judges. It is judges who want to rewrite our laws from the bench \nwhom we believe are unqualified for a lifetime appointment. And we \nstand against them, Mr. President, not as a threat to the Constitution, \nbut in defense of the Constitution.\n\n  We have also been accused of unprecedented acts with respect to these \nnominations. Well, I am not going to go back into all that history. A \nlot of my colleagues have talked about it in the last days. But you \njust cannot come out here with a straight face, on either side--both \nsides have engaged in delaying some nominees--many of them were not \neven allowed out of the committee when President Clinton was in. Waited \nyears; never got out. That does not make it all right, but it is the \nway it works as we fight this process of finding people who meet the \nconsensus of the Senate.\n  Did you hear the minority then hide behind a mythical constitutional \nvalue? No. Did you hear the minority stand up and assert a \nconstitutional violation or the rules of the Senate ought to be \nchanged? No. The majority leader himself has voted to filibuster a \nnominee. It does not matter whether it is 1, 2, or 10 filibusters, a \nfilibuster is a filibuster.\n  President Johnson's nominee to be Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, \nAbe Fortas, was defeated with a filibuster.\n  Tennessee Republican Howard Baker articulated the minority's position \nsaying:\n\n       The majority is not always right all of the time. And it is \n     clear and predictable that the people of America, in their \n     compassionate wisdom, require the protection of the rights of \n     the minority as well as the implementation of the will of the \n     majority.\n\n  Throughout our history, Presidents and majorities have always had to \ngovern a nation where minority rights are protected. Until this day, \nPresidents of the majority have respected that tradition. They were \nhumbled by it. They were inspired by it, by the lessons of history that \ncolleagues seem to have forgotten today.\n  In 1937, President Roosevelt attempted to court pack and assert his \ninfluence. His own party said no. Thomas Jefferson once attempted to \nimpeach a Supreme Court Justice who disagreed with his political \nagenda. His own party said no.\n  When my colleagues complain of lack of precedent, remember those \nprecedents. They were fair, and they were just. They respected the \nConstitution and they defended the judiciary. Our predecessors stood up \nto their own party leaders because they valued the real strength of our \ndemocracy more than the short-term success of a political agenda of the \nmoment. And the question for all of us here is: Are we going to live up \nto that test?\n  Recent predecessors of Senate Republicans have repeatedly urged \nrespect for this--their own party Members, Members of the Republican \nParty, people of extraordinary respect and even reverence. Former \nRepublican Majority Leader Howard Baker said, destroying the right to \nthe filibuster:\n\n     would topple one of the pillars of American democracy, the \n     protection of minority rights from majority rule.\n\n  Former Senator Chuck Mathias said:\n\n       The Senate is not a parliamentary speedway, nor should it \n     be.\n\n  Former Republican Senator Bill Armstrong said:\n\n       Having served in the majority and in the minority, I know \n     it's worthwhile to have the minority empowered. As a \n     conservative, I think there is a value to having a constraint \n     on the majority.\n\n  My colleagues should defend their judges, but do it without tearing \ndown\n\n[[Page S5490]]\n\nthe Constitution and our Founding Fathers, or destroying the rules and \ncharacter of this great institution. Defend your judges without ceding \ndangerous and corruptive levels of power to the executive branch of \nGovernment. Defend your judges without erasing 214 years of wisdom and \nsacrifice that raised this Nation from tyranny and chaos and spread \nfreedom across the globe. Our Founding Fathers would shudder to see how \neasily forces from outside of the mainstream now seem to effortlessly \npush people toward conduct the American people don't want for their \nelected leaders, abusing power, inserting the Government into our \nprivate lives, injecting religion into debates on public policy, \njumping through hoops to ingratiate themselves to their party base, \nwhile step by step and day by day real problems that keep American \nfamilies up at night fall by the wayside in Washington.\n  Congress and our democracy itself are being tested this week and next \nand will be tested in this vote. We each have to ask ourselves \nindividually, as a matter of conscience, what are we prepared to do? I \nhave attended the Senate prayer breakfast with colleagues here. I know \nthis is a place of great faith and a place of real concern. I ask my \ncolleagues to look into their souls and ask themselves, is this the \nright thing to be doing for the long-term interests of our Nation?\n  For those in this Chamber who have reservations about the choices \ntheir leadership has made and worry about the possible repercussions on \nour Constitution and democracy, stop over the weekend and look at \nhistory and find the courage to do what is right. History has always \nremembered and found a place for those who are courageous, and it will \nremember the courageous few who live up to their responsibility now and \nspeak truth to power when the Senate is tested, so that power doesn't \ngo unchecked.\n  The Senate and the country need Senators of courage who are prepared \nto make their mark on history by standing with past profiles in courage \nand defending not party, not partisanship, but defending principle, \ndefending the Constitution, and defending democracy itself.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, when I first came to the Senate, our \nNation was engaged in the Cold War with the Soviet Union. But now, 22 \nyears later, this Senate is experiencing its own cold war. It is a cold \nwar across the aisle that separates the two parties, and it has \nescalated with the threat of this nuclear option.\n  As the name suggests, the result of this threat is nuclear, but in \nmany ways it is also a timebomb. It is a timebomb because, while the \naction will be visible now, it will do irreparable damage to the future \nof this country.\n  Its potential effects on the operations of the United States are well \nknown. But here I want to address my comments to the American people \nbecause they are going to pay the price for the change if it takes \nplace here. The majority leader insists on breaking the rules in order \nto give several people, some of whom deserve far greater review, \nlifetime appointments as high-ranking Federal judges. They could be on \nthe bench for 30 or 40 years, and they will make decisions about your \nlives, your families, your rights, and the future of your children. \nThey will make decisions about our lives, such as: Will clean air rules \nbe enforced against polluters. I hope so. I would like to know my \ngrandchildren can breathe the air and not be harmed by it. I have one \ngrandchild who is asthmatic. My daughter, when he goes to play a game \nor engage in a sport, always checks to see where the nearest emergency \nclinic is.\n  So do we want to leave our kids with air that is polluted, with \ndrinking water that is contaminated? Will we have health care? Will we \nstill have strong constitutional rights? That is what this is about. We \ngot lost in how long the filibuster rule has been in effect and how \ndevastating it will be on the process. But it goes much deeper than \nthat. These are critical questions, and these are the judges who will \nbe answering those questions. They might even one day be asked to help \nelect a President.\n  When I was a soldier 60 years ago and we dropped the earliest version \nof the nuclear bomb, called the atom bomb, we celebrated. We knew we \ncould save thousands of Americans from dying in the fight to vanquish \nour then enemy, Japan.\n  With this nuclear option, the majority leader is threatening to \nannihilate over 200 years of American tradition in the Senate by \ngetting rid of the right that challenges decisions made by a slim \nmajority over a minority of over 140 million people's representatives \nhere in the Senate.\n  Extended debate, or filibuster, is an American tradition that goes \nback to the earliest days of the Senate. While the written rules \nestablishing the Senate filibuster were not adopted until 1806, the \npractice existed even in the first Congress. Historical records \nindicate that in 1790, Senators from Virginia and South Carolina \nengaged in a filibuster, and it has continued since then.\n  The first well-documented filibuster was conducted in 1825 by Senator \nJohn Randolph of Virginia. For several days, Senator Randolph \nfilibustered President John Quincy Adams' economic agenda. That was in \n1825. During the 19th century, there wasn't even an option of a cloture \nto end the filibuster. It continued as long as people had the breath \nand stamina to continue. There was no way to stop determined Senators \nfrom engaging in an unlimited debate. Then, in 1917, the cloture rule \nwas adopted, which established a procedure to end debate only upon a \nvote of a supermajority. Through all of these years, through every \ncrisis, the American tradition of the filibuster has endured. It \nendured through the War of 1812, the Civil War, Reconstruction, two \nworld wars, the Great Depression, the civil rights movement. Yet \nbecause of a few of President Bush's judicial nominees, we are being \nasked to throw out the filibuster safeguards of the huge minority. It \nmakes no sense.\n  We have heard claims that it is unprecedented to mount a filibuster \non a judicial nominee. It can be said, but it is wrong, and the \nevidence is on the Senate's own Web site.\n  I quote from a statement made earlier by the senior Senator from \nMissouri. Mr. Bond said:\n\n       Mr. President, I think the facts are clear. You have heard \n     this many times. Almost everything has been said but not \n     everybody has said it, so I want to go over some of the facts \n     that I think are very, very important. For 214 years, \n     judicial nominations have come to the Senate floor and have \n     been considered without filibuster.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that a table that shows there were 14 judges \nwhose nominations were filibustered since 1968 be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         TABLE 3.--NOMINATIONS SUBJECTED TO CLOTURE ATTEMPTS, 1968-2002\n                     [Executive branch nominations in roman; Judicial nominations in italic]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                     Cloture\n      Congress and year             Nominee          Position        motions       Outcome of     Disposition of\n                                                                      filed     cloture attempt     nomination\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n(1) 90th, 1968...............

(Washington: GPO, 1985), pp. 44-70, 78-85; Congressional Record (Daily Digest); and\n  Congressional Quarterly Almanac for 1986, 1987, 1992, 1995, 1999.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, the Senate Web site points to one \nincident from 1964 to the present time. October 1, 1968: ``Filibuster \nDerails Supreme Court Appointment.'' Why don't our colleagues on the \nother side take their heads out of the sand, open their eyes, read the \nrecord, and tell the public the truth?\n  In 1968, Abe Fortas, Supreme Court Justice, was filibustered. The \nSenate failed to invoke cloture on Fortas. There were only 45 votes for \ncloture. Some say this is proof that a majority of the Senators did not \nsupport Fortas. But President Johnson thought otherwise, noting that 12 \nSenators were absent for the cloture vote. And here from 1968 is a page \n1, first-page headline in the Washington Post. It says: ``Filibuster \nDerails Supreme Court Appointment.''\n\n       A full-dress Republican-led filibuster broke out in the \n     Senate yesterday against the motion to call up the nomination \n     of Justice Abe Fortas for Chief Justice.\n\n  The public ought to know what is being said. Unfortunately, in the \nurgency to get this done, they are not being accurate in the things \nthat are said by the Republican majority.\n  So in 1968--note this, people across the country--on a nomination to \nbe the most influential judge in the country, there was a filibuster. I \nam not a lawyer, but it seems to me that those who say this has not \nhappened before are guilty of factual negligence. The right to \nfilibuster is fundamental to the Senate because the Senate was created \nby our Constitution to protect the rights of the minority.\n  Just this weekend, one of the most distinguished Members of the \nSenate, our colleague from Arizona, Senator McCain, explained it very \nwell. Senator McCain said:\n\n       The Senate was designed to protect the minority. That is \n     why Wyoming has two votes, and that's why California has two \n     votes. That's why Rhode Island--\n\n  Another small State--\n\n     had two votes among the original 13, and New York and \n     Massachusetts and Virginia had two votes.\n\n  The modern Senate reflects the same types of disparities in \npopulation as the original Senate. My home State, for instance, New \nJersey, has a population that is greater than Alaska, Wyoming, Kansas, \nNorth Dakota, South Dakota, and Mississippi combined. But New Jersey \nonly gets two votes in this body, and each one of those States I \nmentioned also gets two votes. So it is not surprising that when you do \nthe math on the current Senate, you find that the majority is actually \nin the minority, and the minority is the majority.\n  Here is what I mean very simply put. The Republican caucus with 55 \nSenators and with each Senator getting half of the vote in that State \nrepresents 144 million people. The Democratic caucus with 45 Senators \nrepresents 148 million people. The first one, 144 million; the second \none, 148 million--that does not look like much of a minority to me. \nThat is what we are looking at.\n  Mr. President, what you find is the minority in this body, the \nDemocratic caucus, represents more than the majority, and that is \nexactly what the Founding Fathers wanted to protect--minority rights in \nthe Senate--because a minority of Senators may actually represent a \nmajority of the people. So it is corrected by a process we have here. \nThe Democratic caucus on this side of the aisle represents many more \nAmericans than the Republican side. That is why we have a filibuster \nrule. That is why we generally operate by unanimous consent.\n  The right to filibuster is not just some obscure rule in the Senate. \nIt is part of our American heritage, and it has been celebrated by our \nculture and our folklore. As many Americans know, the filibuster was \nimmortalized in the film ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.'' Here we see \na picture of Jimmy Stewart as he played Senator Smith. He used the \nfilibuster to protect the interests of his constituents back home. This \nimage shows Senator Smith in the midst of his filibuster.\n  From some of the things we have heard from the majority leader, you \nmight think Mr. Smith was the bad guy in that film. No, Mr. Smith, as a \nfilibustering Senator, is not only the good guy, but he is the hero of \nthat film. That film is a celebration of our American democracy. It is \na celebration of this Senate, the world's greatest deliberative body. \nBut if the majority leader is successful in ending the filibuster, in \nending the representation that the huge minority deserves, we will move \nfrom the world's greatest deliberative body to a rubberstamp factory.\n  The Constitution gives us an active role in the nomination process. \nThe Senate is not a mere formality under the Constitution. The Founding \nFathers intended the Senate to be a check on the President's power. We \nhear our colleagues on the other side pleading for a majority vote; let \nthe Senate act as it should.\n  The Senate is responsible for the quality of people we put on the \ncourts, and if there is a challenge, so be it. Let the majority party \nmake the case, convince us that these people are not what we think they \nare in terms of their activist views. Is it an inconvenience to the \nPresident to contend with the Senate? Perhaps. But direct your \ncomplaints to Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and our Founding \nFathers. You will find they had their hands full, and they knew how to \ndeal with it.\n\n  I know our majority leader has said:\n\n       We can keep the filibuster for legislation, just not on \n     nominations.\n\n  But the American people know you cannot sort of end the filibuster. \nIf this\n\n[[Page S5492]]\n\nnuclear option goes into place, citizens across our country understand \nthat their rights will be taken away in large part by those who have \nexpressed themselves before they were nominated in matters dealing with \ngender, dealing with marriage, dealing with all kinds of issues on \nwhich the American people have a right to have a view.\n  No, this now says we are just going to do it for the judges. Beware, \nonce that barn door opens, we are going to see all kinds of changes. \nYou cannot sort of end the filibuster. You either have to keep the \nfilibuster or you end it.\n  Would the majority leader like to rename the Jimmy Stewart film, \n``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington Except for Judges''?\n  Speaking of popular culture, the biggest film of the year is opening \nthis week, ``Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith.'' This is one of the \ncharacters in that film. He is portrayed here on this chart. He is the \nleader of the Senate in a far-off universe. In this film, this leader \nof the Senate breaks rules to give himself and his supporters more \npower, and after this move from the Senate leader, another Senator \nstates:\n\n       This is how liberty dies.\n\n  One film critic described this film as a story of ``how a republic \ndismantles its own Democratic principles.''\n  As millions of Americans go to see this film this week and in the \nweeks ahead, I sincerely hope it does not mirror actions being \ncontemplated in the Senate. I say to my colleagues, do not let liberty \ndie. I urge my colleagues, on behalf of the American people--and I ask \nthe American people to express themselves on this--do you want to give \nup your rights, do you want to give up your rights to protect your \nchildren against a foul environment? Do you want to give up your rights \nto be able to work in a safe environment? Do you want to give up your \nrights to decide on questions such as war and peace? I urge do not let \nit happen. I urge my colleagues to oppose any attempt to break the \nSenate rules and destroy over 200 years of American tradition. We must \nsave the United States and the interests of our country as a whole.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I have served in the Senate for a bit over \n4 years. When I came, I never imagined I would stand on this floor and \ndefend a filibuster. I came to try to make sure we preserve jobs and \nbring in new ones, to make sure kids got a new education, to make sure \nwe brought down the costs of health care and made it affordable and \nextended to a whole lot more people, that we ran a fiscally sound ship \nof state, and that we provided for the security of our Nation. I came \nfor all of those things. I never imagined I would be standing in a food \nfight on how we are going to approve these judges, how many \nconfirmations are enough and what constitutes a shortfall.\n  In Delaware, we are proud of being the first State. We were the first \nState to ratify the Constitution. We did it December 7, 1787. The \nConstitution that we confirmed at the Golden Fleece Tavern in Dover, \nDE, had been hammered out about 75 miles north up the road in \nPhiladelphia. The last part of the Constitution that was hammered out, \nmaybe one of the more difficult aspects of the Constitution, was not \nonly who is going to be President, how are we going to pick the \nPresident, how long will their terms be. That was worked out. They did \nnot get caught up in how old does one have to be to be a Senator or how \nold does one have to be to be a Representative, how long are the terms \ngoing to be. That was worked out. What was hardest to work out in the \nConstitutional Convention, almost harder than anything else, was how we \nare going to pick these judges.\n  There were some folks at the Constitutional Convention, led by Ben \nFranklin, who were fearful we would end up in this country with a king. \nWe may not call him a king or we may not call her a queen, but we would \nend up with a king. They were dead-set determined to make sure we did \nnot do that.\n  If we read through the Constitution, it is an intricate set of checks \nand balances that are designed to make sure that we have a President \nbut we do not have a king. With those sets of checks and balances, the \nConstitution has served us extraordinarily well.\n  The Constitution also said, in addition to having a House and a \nSenate and how one gets elected to serve and how long they serve, it \nalso said the House and Senate could each set out their rules. The \nConstitution does not say what the rules of the Senate are. It says we \ncan write our own, and we have done that.\n  We heard earlier this afternoon about how the rules have been changed \nwith respect to invoking cloture to end debate. Before 1917, Senators \ncould not invoke cloture. Another Senator could talk literally as long \nas they could stand. From about 1917 to 1975 or so, the rule was that \nthere had to be roughly a two-thirds supermajority to be able to end \ndebate. Using the rules of the Senate to effect change, the rules were \nchanged to say, no, a three-fifths majority, 60 Senators, is needed to \nbring debate to a close.\n  It is interesting how we confirm our judges in Delaware. Governors \nnominate with the advice and consent of the Senate. We do not nominate \npeople to lifetime terms on the bench. We nominate them to 12-year \nterms. The remarkable thing in Delaware is for every--and I served 8 \nyears as Governor--Democrat I nominated to the bench I had to nominate \na Republican. We are equally balanced Democrat and Republican.\n\n  In survey after survey, the Delaware legal environment, including our \njudiciary, is regarded maybe as the best in the country. We do not have \nthese food fights in Delaware. We have the best judiciary. We have \nDemocrats and we have Republicans who serve on the bench. They are \nnominated by Republican and by Democratic Governors.\n  I ran into a friend of mine not long ago who has loosely been \nfollowing this debate on judicial nominations. He asked: Why do you not \nconfirm more of the President's judicial nominees? And I said: How many \ndo you think we have confirmed, or what percentage do you think we have \nconfirmed?\n  He said: Maybe half.\n  And I said: No, no my friend, 95 percent.\n  He said: Really? Do you not have a lot of vacancies on the Federal \njudiciary bench?\n  I said: No. We have one of the lowest vacancy rates we have had in \nyears.\n  I asked him in return: While we have confirmed over the last 4 years \n95 percent of President Bush's nominees to the bench, what percentage \nof President Clinton's nominees do you think were confirmed during his \nfirst 4 years?\n  Well, I do not have a chart here that says what the answer to that \nquestion is, but just to remind us all, from 2001 to the beginning of \nthis year, 95 percent of President Bush's nominees have been confirmed.\n  If I had a magic marker I would make a big yellow line through this \nand write in 81 percent because that is the percentage of President \nClinton's nominees that were confirmed in his first 4 years.\n  There is a great irony. I am told we never heard a peep or a squeak \nfrom our friends on the other side of the aisle during the first \nClinton administration when his nominees were denied a vote on the \nfloor. It was not because of a filibuster. They were denied a vote on \nthe floor because somebody on the other side of the aisle in the Senate \nJudiciary Committee would not let a hearing be held, not on one or two \njudges nominated by Bill Clinton but on scores of them. They would not \nhave a hearing. They would not let a nominee out of committee. They did \nnot have to kill them on the floor in a filibuster. They did it in \ncommittee, quietly, out of the view of the public.\n  Now, why just a few years ago was it okay to deny 19 percent of \nPresident Clinton's nominees an up-or-down vote on this floor? Why was \nthat okay? And why is it with this President--he received 95 percent of \nwhat he wants and actually in the end he will get more than that. There \nare a couple from Michigan that we are going to confirm. Some of the 10 \nhave basically withdrawn their names or retired from the bench.\n  The figure of 95 percent actually understates what ultimately this \nPresident will realize in confirmation victories.\n  The other number I want to share, talking about advice and consent, \nis 2,703. This number is 1. What do they refer to? During the first 4 \nyears of\n\n[[Page S5493]]\n\nPresident Bush's presidency, he nominated over 200 judges. Republicans \nand Democrats voted on those judges. There were 2,703 aye votes from \nthe Republican side of the aisle on President Bush's judicial nominees. \nIn those 4 years, there was one nay vote from the Republican side of \nthe aisle on a judicial nominee of this President.\n  We can argue forever what advice and consent really was meant to be \nwhen the Constitution was written. But if we are in a situation where \n50 percent plus 1, 51 percent, would enable a nominee of this President \nor any other President to go on to serve for life on the Federal bench, \nand if you look at the last 4 years and only 1 person out of 2,704 \nvotes was no, does that give you any kind of confidence that we are \ngoing to see any sort of checks and balances going forward? It doesn't \ngive me much.\n\n  I do not care if you are a Democrat or Republican, it should not \nmatter. It should not matter who is in the White House or the House and \nSenate. But when you get a situation where you have one party that \ncontrols the White House and one party controls the House of \nRepresentatives and one party controls the Senate, and you have, out of \n2,704 votes for judicial nominees, only 1 Republican Senator who ever \nvoted no, and it was for somebody initially nominated by Bill Clinton, \nthat is something we ought to worry about.\n  Someday, someday we are going to have a Democratic President. Someday \nwe are going to have a Democratic majority in this body. We have \nsayings in Delaware. I bet they have in Minnesota, too. Maybe in \nVermont. Among those sayings are these: Chickens do come home to roost; \nthe beds that we make are some days the beds that we get to sleep in; \nwhat goes around comes around.\n  I promise you, I promise you, my friends, if a decision is made to \npull this trigger, this nuclear option, and we end up with a situation \nwhere the rights of the minority really are, in my view, ignored, maybe \neven trampled on, the Republicans who do this will come to rue the day.\n  Let me close with this. I came here to get things done. As I look \naround this floor, the other Senators who are here whom I respect, I \nknow you came here to get things done as well. I mentioned at the \noutset the kinds of things I wanted to see us accomplish. I describe \nmyself as a recovering Governor. We have a recovering mayor who is \npresiding here today. We like to work together. We would like to work \nacross the aisle. We are even happy to work with the President, \nDemocrat or Republican.\n  My fear is here is what is going to happen. If this action succeeds, \nif we do change the rules of the Senate to lower to 51 the votes that \nare needed to end a filibuster on judicial nominations, that is a \nslippery slope. If we can do it on judges, we can do it on other \nnominees to other posts, we can do it on amendments, we can do it on \nbills. It is a slippery slope. But there is an even greater concern to \nme, as a guy who wants to get things done.\n  I see Senator Leahy is here. He is working with Senator Specter on \nasbestos litigation reform. We need to pass that litigation. We need to \nright a wrong. My fear is, if we take this step, trying to work out a \nvery difficult compromise on that legislation will be made more \ndifficult, not easier. We need to address the rising cost of health \ncare and all the folks who do not have it and cannot afford it, and \nemployers are stopping providing it. We need a comprehensive energy \npolicy in this country. It is tough in the best of times to hammer that \nout.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator from Delaware yield?\n  Mr. CARPER. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I absolutely agree with the Senator from Delaware. We have \na lot of bipartisan legislation that is not even being looked at. The \nNOPEC bill is one, with Senator DeWine, Senator Kohl, myself, and \nothers. We looked at the fact that gasoline prices have gone up nearly \n50 percent in the last 5 years alone, and yet we have no constraints on \nartificial prices being set by the NOPEC countries here in the United \nStates. It takes more than holding hands with Saudi princes to bring \ndown prices. We have to ask for real efforts. This is legislation that \ncould pass. This is legislation that could pass. Put some teeth in it. \nInstead of holding hands, we could hold court actions, and we would be \nsomewhere ahead. That is just one area.\n\n  The Senator from Delaware mentioned the asbestos bill. Senator \nSpecter and I have worked on it on a totally bipartisan fashion with \nSenators on both sides of the aisle. We have a bill that could pass. It \nwould take some effort on the floor. It would take a week or so, but it \ncould pass. Victims of asbestosis would be helped. Companies would have \nsome idea what their costs are. The economy would dramatically improve. \nThat bill is going to die if the nuclear option goes through because we \nwill lose the ability to move bipartisan legislation.\n  We have law enforcement legislation at a time when most of the law \nenforcement grants, such as the COPS grants and whatnot, are being cut \nby the administration. A lot of Members on both sides of the aisle are \ntrying to find a way to get that money back to our police officers, the \nmoney being cut. We cannot have a debate on it.\n  This is going to take up--you confirmed 208 judges; blocked, \nactually, 5. I have been here 31 years. I don't believe anyone has had \na record that good. Certainly no baseball team ever had a record that \ngood. The President ought to declare victory on that, having done so \nmuch better than all but about three Presidents of recent memory, and \nlet us get on with things. Bring down the price of gasoline, for one; \nthat is affecting the American people.\n  Mr LEAHY. Mr. President, today we continue to debate the Republican \nLeader's bid for one-party rule through his insistence to trigger the \n``nuclear option.'' I spoke yesterday about this misguided effort to \nundercut the checks and balances that the Senate provides in our system \nof Government, and about the need to protect the rights of the American \npeople, the independence and fairness of the Federal courts, and \nminority rights here in the Senate.\n  I started my statement yesterday by commending the chairman of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee. Today I want to add and thank a number of \nSenators who participated throughout the debate yesterday for their \ncontributions: the Democratic leader; the assistant Democratic leader \nand senior Senator from Illinois; the senior Senator from Washington; \nboth Senators from California; the senior Senator from New York; the \nsenior Senator from Montana; the senior Senator from Minnesota, the \nsenior Senator from Massachusetts and Senator Dorgan.\n  I noted yesterday that this is a setting in which Democratic Senators \nalone will not be able to rescue the Senate and our system of checks \nand balances from the breaking of the Senate rules that the Republican \nleader is planning to demand. If the rights of the minority are to be \npreserved, if the Senate's unique role in our system of Government is \nto be preserved, it will take at least six Republicans standing up for \nfairness and for checks and balances. I believe that a number of \nRepublican Senators know in their hearts that this nuclear option is \nthe wrong way to go. I know that Republican Senators with whom I have \nbeen privileged to serve know better. I hope that more than six \nRepublican Senators will withstand the political pressures being \nbrought to bear upon them and do the right thing, the honorable thing. \nI have to believe that enough Republican Senators will put the Senate \nfirst, the Constitution first, and the American people first, and \nwithstand those political pressures when they cast their votes.\n  Today, as we continue this discussion, I note that the Senate remains \nfixated on a handful of the President's most extreme and divisive \njudicial nominees. The Democratic leader rightly said recently that the \ncurrent tally is 208 to 5. The Senate has confirmed 208 of President \nBush's judicial nominees, and we are resisting action on five.\n  I included in the Record yesterday my statement laying out my reasons \nfor opposing the nomination of Priscilla Owen. As we continue to debate \na nomination that was rejected by the Judiciary Committee in 2002 and \non which the Senate engaged in extensive debate in 2004, the Senate is \nneglecting other matters. That is the choice made by the Republican \nleadership, in insisting on this confrontation and upcoming conflict.\n  The Democratic leader is right when he urges the Senate to ``put \npeople over\n\n[[Page S5494]]\n\npartisanship'' and to work to reduce gas prices, make health care more \naffordable, create new and better jobs and give our veterans and their \nfamilies the support they need and deserve.\n  Among the matters being neglected in order to engage in this \npolitical exercise is consideration and passage of the NOPEC bill, S. \n555. This is bipartisan legislation. Our lead sponsors are Senator \nDeWine and Senator Kohl. With the increase of gasoline prices by almost \n50 percent during the Bush Presidency, with Americans having to pay so \nmuch more each week to get to work, drive their kids to school and just \nto get around, the Republican leadership of the Senate is ignoring a \nsubstantial burden on American working families.\n  This week, the national average price for a gallon of regular \ngasoline was $2.18. In Vermont, gas is slightly less expensive, but \nstill a hefty $2.15 per gallon. Just a year ago the price was $1.92. \nWhen President Bush took office it was $1.46 a gallon.\n  The artificial pricing scheme enforced by OPEC affects all of us, and \nit is especially tough on our hard-working Vermont farmers. Rising \nenergy expenses can add thousands of dollars a year to the costs of \noperating a 100-head dairy operation, a price that could mean the \ndifference between keeping the family business open for another \ngeneration or shutting it down.\n  With summer coming, many families are going to find that OPEC has put \nan expensive crimp in their vacation plans. Some are likely to stay \nhome; others will pay more to drive or to fly so that they can visit \ntheir families or take their well-deserved vacations.\n  Americans deserve better, and if the White House will not act to \nabate this crisis, it is time for Congress to act. It is past the time \nto hold hands and exchange kisses with Saudi princes who artificially \ninflate the price of gasoline. The President's ``jawboning'' with his \nSaudi friends has proven unsuccessful. It is now time to act, and the \nSenate, under the Republican majority leader, is choosing instead to \nrevisit a handful of extreme judicial nominations that have already \nbeen considered and rejected by this body.\n  The production quotas set by OPEC continue to take a debilitating \ntoll on our economy, our families, our businesses, our industry and our \nfarmers. Last year and again last month, the Judiciary Committee voted \nto report favorably to the full Senate the bipartisan NOPEC bill. Our \nlegislation would apply America's antitrust laws to OPEC's \nanticompetitive cartel. Why not give the Justice Department the clear \nauthority to use our antitrust laws against the anti-competitive, anti-\nconsumer conduct in which they have engaged? We should take up that \nbill, debate it and pass it without further delay. The many days of the \nSenate's time allocated to the provocative ``nuclear option'' comes at \nthe expense of our taking up the NOPEC bill on behalf of the American \npeople.\n  Another consequence of this fixation on the effort to increase the \nWhite House's political power, and to aid this President's attempt to \npack the Federal courts, is the loss in focus and sacrifice of progress \nwe have been making on asbestos reform. For more than 3 years I have \nbeen working on asbestos reform to provide compensation to asbestos \nvictims in a fair and more expedited fashion.\n  Chairman Specter and I have worked closely on S. 852, the FAIR Act. \nIt is pending before the Judiciary Committee. We are in the midst of \nour markup sessions. That effort was scheduled for yesterday and today, \nbut the Chairman had to cancel our consideration yesterday in light of \nthis debate and it had to be cut short today. That is most unfortunate. \nWe have been working hard and in good faith to achieve bipartisan \nlegislative progress on this issue. We have done so despite criticism \nfrom many quarters. That bipartisan effort is now being retarded by \nthis continuing debate.\n  There are many, many items that need prompt attention. I understand \nthat the Armed Services Committee last week completed its work on the \nDepartment of Defense Authorization bill. Why the Republican leadership \nis delaying Senate consideration of the Defense Authorization bill I do \nnot understand. At a time when we have young men and women in combat \nzones and when the home front is being affected by recently recommended \nbase closings, I would have thought the Defense Authorization bill \nwould be a priority.\n  Let me mention just one other set of legislative issues. Last week \nwas Police Week. On Sunday I was privileged to attend the National \nPeace Officers' Memorial Service commemorating the service and \nsacrifice of 154 public safety officers killed in the line of duty over \nthe last year. I worked in a bipartisan way with Senators Specter, \nBiden, Hatch, Brownback, Cornyn, DeWine, Durbin, Feingold, Feinstein, \nKennedy, Kohl, Kyl, Schumer, Salazar and Collins to introduce and pass \nS. Res. 131, which recognized May 15 as Peace Officers Memorial Day and \ncalled upon the entire Nation to join in honoring our law enforcement \nofficers. The President spoke movingly at the ceremony held here on \nCapitol Hill on that day of remembrance.\n  This week we should honor our law enforcement officers with \nsupportive legislative action. In the past we have worked in a \nbipartisan way to improve the Public Safety Officers Benefit Program \nand to provide educational benefits for the families of State and \nFederal officers who have been killed in the line of duty. Sadly, the \nadministration has not yet implemented the latest round of improvements \nto the Public Safety Officers Benefit Program that we enacted last \nyear. I have urged a Judiciary Committee hearing on this delay, as well \nas on the general state of police officer safety. The Fraternal Order \nof Police, the International Association of Chiefs of Police, the \nNational Association of Police Organizations, the National Sheriffs' \nFoundation and other law enforcement organizations are all interested \nin working with us to ensure that the Justice Department produces \ncomprehensive regulations that effectively create a more user-friendly \nPSOB Program.\n  In addition, we should be considering the Social Security Fairness \nAct, S. 619, the bill that Senators Collins, Boxer, Feinstein and a \nnumber of us have cosponsored over the years to protect the Social \nSecurity and retirement of police officers. Those on the front lines \nprotecting all of us from crime and violence should not see their \nSocial Security benefits reduced because they have historically \nparticipated in separate retirement benefit programs. That needs fixing \nand this week would be an appropriate one to take that Senate action.\n  These are merely examples of some of the business matters the \nRepublican majority of the Senate has laid aside.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, what I was saying, in closing, one of my \ngreatest fears is that we end up with this partisan battle. Those of us \nwho fervently want to accomplish asbestos litigation reform, a \ncomprehensive energy bill, determining what the business model for the \nPostal Service ought to be in the 21st century or the passenger rail \nservice in the 21st century--what should our next steps be in welfare \nreform? How are we going to provide health care coverage, reduce the \ncosts, and extend coverage to all kinds of people? There is a ton of \nstuff, so many issues we need to address.\n  The postal bill alone--the Presiding Officer serves on the Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs Committee with me. We worked for \nyears, Senator Collins, myself, and others, to determine what should \nthe Postal Service look like in the 21st century. What should the \nbusiness model be? We unanimously passed the bill last year out of \ncommittee. Over in the House of Representatives, almost the very same \nbill was negotiated, debated, and passed unanimously by our counterpart \ncommittee. There was not a single ``no'' vote. We could not get either \nbill to the floor for debate. And that is when we agree.\n  I remind my friends, if it is that hard to get legislation through \nthe House and Senate to the President for his signature when we agree, \nGod help us on difficult issues such as asbestos or comprehensive \nenergy policy or health care or the like.\n  Finally, I have a whole lot of quotes here. I was trying to figure \nwho to close my remarks by quoting. I looked for something for the \nSenator from Minnesota, the Presiding Officer, which might seem \nappropriate. I couldn't find anything, at least on this subject, so I \nturned to another source. I think it is\n\n[[Page S5495]]\n\nactually pretty good. It is not a Senator, but he probably wouldn't be \na bad one, a fellow who has thought a lot and written a lot and I think \nis generally regarded more favorably on the other side of the aisle \nthan this one, and he makes a lot of sense sometimes. I will close my \ncomments today with a quote from George Will. Here is what he said \nabout the filibuster:\n\n       The filibuster is an important defense of minority rights, \n     enabling democratic government to measure and respect not \n     merely numbers but also intensity in public controversies. \n     Filibusters enable intense minorities to slow the \n     governmental juggernaut. Conservatives, who do not think \n     government is sufficiently inhibited, should cherish this \n     blocking mechanism. And someone should puncture Republicans' \n     current triumphalism by reminding them that someday they will \n     again be in the minority.\n\n  Will goes on to conclude:\n\n       The promiscuous use of filibusters, against policies as \n     well as nominees, has trivialized the tactic. But filibusters \n     do not forever deflect the path of democratic government. Try \n     to name anything significant that an American majority has \n     desired, strongly and protractedly, but has not received \n     because of a filibuster.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from North \nCarolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Madam President, I rise to urge my colleagues to support an \nup-or-down vote on these judicial nominees. I have a great respect for \nmy colleague from Delaware, and I do not stand up with pretty charts \nwith big numbers. I am not a recovering State legislator or recovering \ncity mayor, and I hope I am never a recovering parent or father.\n  I stand up as a parent today, as a father of two kids, with the full \nknowledge and understanding that the work we do up here in large \nmeasure dictates the America that is going to be there for them. That \nif we are to follow the strategies on that side, the chart that my \ncolleague showed would never change because we would never vote. That \nbipartisanship that is needed for legislation--whether it is health \ncare or whether it is energy policy or whether it is asbestos reform--\nwould not be achievable because we would never come here to register a \nyea or nay on behalf of the people who sent us here.\n\n  We are faced with difficult votes, but we take those difficult votes. \nWe do not shy away from the responsibility that people elected us to \ncome here and to make a judgment call and, more importantly, to be held \nresponsible for it. The only thing I can think of relative to not \ntaking a vote is that there are some who believe they will not be held \nresponsible if, in fact, they force this body not to vote, that \neventually people will wear down and that if we happen to seat someone \nthat is not the best, the most qualified, that is OK because it saved \nthis institution a fight.\n  I will tell my colleagues I cannot think of anything more important \nif there is going to be a fight than that fight be on who we put on the \nbench.\n  Now, today's debate, though we have a nominee up, I don't think is \nabout one particular person because clearly we have not heard arguments \nthat this is an unqualified individual. As a matter of fact, in seeking \ncompromise there have been proffers now to this side that suggested: We \nwill vote on five, but not seven, and you pick the two you want to \nchuck overboard.\n  What message do we want to send to that law student out there who \naspires one day to being on the bench and ultimately seeking a \nnomination by the President to a Federal court or to the Supreme Court? \nIf you want to do it, understand you will go through personal character \nassassination; that in some cases you may have to wait 4-plus years to \nget there.\n  In 1995, Senator Lautenberg stood on this same floor, in this same \nbuilding, as a Member of the Senate, and he said this then when talking \nabout fairness of the system and how it is equitable for a minority to \nrestrict the majority view:\n\n       Why can we not have a straight up-or-down vote on this \n     without threats of filibuster, without threats of filibuster. \n     Whether it was Robert Bork and John Tower or Clarence Thomas, \n     even though there was strong opposition, many Senators \n     opposed them. The fact is, the votes were held up or down.\n\n  June 21, 1995. Senator Lautenberg.\n  Today, he denies this Senate a vote on a judicial nominee and \nthreatens a filibuster on all the nominees.\n  This afternoon, Senator Kerry claimed it is dangerous for the Senate \nto limit filibusters on judicial nominees. Senator Kennedy and Senator \nLautenberg joined Senator Kerry in defending judicial filibusters. But \non January 5, 1995, just shortly before, Senator Lautenberg was on the \nSenate floor making the statement I read, all three of those Senators \nvoted to change the Senate rules to eliminate all filibusters on \nnominations, motions, legislation--everything. If any of those three \nSenators had had their way in January 1995, we would have an up-or-down \nvote on these judicial candidates, but we also wouldn't have the \nability of the filibuster as a tool in the legislative process.\n  Some claim this is the start down a road to doom. It is not down the \nroad to doom. Senator Kerry, Senator Lautenberg, and Senator Kennedy \nvoted for it and were joined by Senator Feingold, Senator Boxer, \nSenator Sarbanes, Senator Harkin, Senator Lieberman, and Senator \nBingaman. We are not plowing ground that hasn't been plowed.\n  If anything, we are saying, for 214 years this institution, the \nSenate, had a gentleman's agreement, and that agreement was that the \nfilibuster would never be used for judicial nominees. For 214 years \nthey showed restraint, even though the rule allowed them to do it \nbecause they understood that the process was so important to make sure \nthe best and the brightest found their way to the bench. For 214 years \na handshake was all it took.\n  Something changed in the last Congress. For the first time it was \nactually used. Now, in an effort to have an up-or-down vote, to have a \nprocess like I described in the last election to the people who elected \nme that I would come here and try to achieve, even if we needed to make \nsure that the constitutional option of eliminating the filibuster only \nas it exists for judicial nominees is removed, some suggest that would \nbe disastrous for the Senate.\n  Some of those same people in 1995 voted to eliminate the filibuster \nfor judicial nominees, for the legislative process, for everything, and \nthey are the same ones who claim this would be disastrous to the Senate \ntoday.\n  So much has been said, so many accusations, so many claims, so many \nrevisionists of history. The reality is in a conversation I had with a \nhigh school student just this week, as she looked at me: Can you \nexplain these actions on the floor? I talked about the 214 years that \nthe gentleman's agreement allowed a nominee to get an up-or-down vote \nwith no filibuster and the fear that we were reaching a point where we \nmight have to make a decision, and the concern that existed in this \nSenate and around the country that it might be disastrous. She looked \nat me after I explained it to her and she said: Senator, with 214 years \nof experience, it is not going to be disastrous. Why would you wait so \nlong to do it?\n  The reality is that sometimes it takes years to understand what we \nhave a hard time understanding up here. For 214 years the filibuster \nwas not used, and we picked the best and brightest and got them on the \nbench and they guided this country and we have been headed in the right \ndirection.\n  If the choice is made and we have to choose to eliminate this tool, \nthis is not a dangerous thing for the institution. We have 214 years of \nexperience. We will be just fine. And the challenge will be to protect \nthat filibuster as it relates to the legislative process.\n  I am here as a new member, as a father, as a citizen, who deeply \nbelieves I was sent to the Senate to get work done. That work I do on \nbehalf of North Carolina and for the citizens across this country. \nThere is no doubt in my mind that I was sent here to do what the people \nof North Carolina heard me say that I would do, and that was to work \nhard and to accomplish solutions to real problems. There is no doubt in \nmy mind the task includes ensuring that the Senate provides judicial \nnominees on up-or-down votes.\n  I am not going to lobby my colleagues which way to vote, but isn't it \ncommon courtesy to allow these nominees to have some finality to this \nprocess? The judge that is up today, Priscilla Owen, has been in this \nprocess for 4 years. I have asked myself, even though I am not a lawyer \nby profession, would I stick with it 4 years? Would I put myself and my \nfamily, my\n\n[[Page S5496]]\n\nfriends, my career through the types of delays that she has faced? The \nanswer is, I do not know.\n  The question is, What are future nominees going to say when they get \nthat call, when the President of the United States--whether he is a \nRepublican or Democrat--calls in the future, and says, I need your \nservice to this country, and they look at the precedent of 4 years, of \n2 years, of 18 months, of the harassment, of the claims? Are they going \nto say ``yes, sir'' or ``yes, ma'am'' to the President of the United \nStates? They might. But we might lose the opportunity at the best and \nthe brightest.\n  One month ago, I joined my freshmen colleagues in urging the Senate \nleadership to get in a room, to break the current impasse regarding \njudicial nominees, and to develop a process that was respectful of both \nparties, where judicial nominees, at the end of the day, receive an up-\nor-down vote.\n  I said earlier, the Democrat's offer was: We will vote on five but \nchuck two of them over the side, and you pick which two. I cannot think \nof anything worse for the future of this country than for us to treat \nthe best and the brightest with the disregard that proffer would \nsuggest.\n  I remain hopeful still today that a resolution can be reached. Many \nof us have worked toward a fair process where all judicial nominees \nwith majority support, regardless of party, receive an up-or-down vote. \nLet me say that again: regardless of party, receive an up-or-down vote.\n  What happened for 214 years? This debate is about principle. It is \nabout allowing judicial nominees an up-or-down vote on the Senate \nfloor. And I believe it is an issue of fairness. Let me be perfectly \nclear, though. I believe if one of my colleagues objects to a \nparticular nominee, it is certainly appropriate and fair for my \ncolleague to vote against that nominee on the floor of the Senate. But \ndenying judicial nominees of both parties, who seek to serve their \ncountry, an up-or-down vote, simply is not fair. It was certainly not \nthe intention of our Founding Fathers when they designed and created \nthis very institution.\n  Together, as Members of the Senate, we are advocates for democracy \nand for a democratic system of government. It is vital that we have a \nsystem that continues to serve as an illustration of effective \ndemocracy around the world. The integrity of our judicial system is so \nvery important, and it will certainly suffer as a result of inaction.\n  Obstructing votes on Presidential nominees threatens the future of \nour judicial system and the nature of the Supreme Court. You see, I am \nnot sure that many Americans have stopped to think: Well, what happens \nif this is exercised for Supreme Court Justices? Because I believe in \nthe next several years we will have one or two or possibly more Supreme \nCourt nominees to consider.\n  Well, the Court still meets. If we are not able to produce a Justice \nout of this fine Hall, then they will meet with eight Justices. I have \nto believe there is an odd number of Justices for a very logical \nreason. It was so there would not be a tie.\n  On a 4-to-4 tie, what happens? Seldom have we asked the question. On \na 4-to-4 tie in the Supreme Court, the lower court's decision stands. \nThat means all of a sudden the Supreme Court, our highest court, the \nCourt we look to to be the best and brightest to interpret law and the \nConstitution, is insignificant in the process. It means that whatever \nthat court of appeals was--the Fourth Circuit or the Ninth Circuit--\nwhatever decision they came up with that somebody believed was wrong, \nand they appealed it to the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court, on \nthe merits of the case, heard it, would become the law of the land.\n  My colleagues on the other side argue that the reason this is so \nimportant is because a Federal judgeship is for life. Let me say to \nthem today, if you exercise this as it relates to the Supreme Court of \nthe United States, and you jeopardize that there may be a 4-to-4 tie, \nthe result is not for the lifetime of the judge you did not seek, it is \nfor the lifetime of this country because that is now the law of the \nland, that an appellate court, whether it is the Fourth or the Ninth--\nnot the Supreme Court--that will be the ultimate determining factor as \nto what the law is that our children, our grandchildren, their \nchildren, their grandchildren will live by for their entirety.\n  I urge my colleagues to consider the nomination of Priscilla Owen and \nall the Federal judges who enjoy the support of a majority of the \nMembers of this Senate. I am reminded, as I stand here, that so much \nhas been said that suggests this process has not been fair. I have \nlooked back at some of my colleagues who have been here for years and \nwho have experience I hope one day to have in this fine institution.\n  Senator Boxer, in 1997, said:\n\n       According to the U.S. Constitution, the President nominates \n     and the Senate shall provide advice and consent. It is not \n     the role of the Senate to obstruct the process and to prevent \n     numbers of highly qualified nominees from even being given \n     the opportunity for a vote on the Senate floor.\n\n  What has changed since 1997? I read this statement four or five \ntimes. There are no exceptions. There is no ``shall be'' or ``case \nof.'' It is very clear, ``given the opportunity for a vote on the \nSenate floor.''\n  And Senator Durbin, who has been a regular in this debate, in 1998, \nsaid:\n\n       I think that responsibility requires us to act in a timely \n     fashion on nominees sent before us.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       If after 150 days languishing on the Executive Calendar \n     that name has not been called for a vote, it should be. Vote \n     the person up or down. They are either qualified or they are \n     not.\n\n  One hundred fifty days should be an automatic trigger that a judicial \nnominee should come up for a vote up or down--1998--no qualifications, \nno exceptions. Well, Priscilla Owen has been waiting 4 years. If we had \naccepted his challenge in 1998, Senator Durbin's challenge, 150 days \nafter she was first nominated, this body would have voted up or down.\n  I believe she ought to be voted on up or down today. I believe it is \nan injustice to the American people that a threat of a filibuster or \nthe application of a filibuster will be applied to the judicial \nnominees.\n  Madam President, I know there are a lot of Members who want to speak. \nI am convinced there will be truths and there will be half-truths that \nwill be spoken as we go through this process. But I am also assured \nthat every Member of the Senate understands the obligation we have when \nwe are sworn in. I would urge my colleagues that obligation is not to a \n2-year session of Congress. It is not an obligation to show up every \nday. It is not an obligation to be involved in committee work, or it is \nnot an obligation necessarily to come up with solutions to problems. \nBut it is an obligation to vote. It is an obligation that when you come \nin this body it is with the intent to vote up or down. I am convinced \nthat when Priscilla Owen is allowed to have a vote, that her nomination \nwill be confirmed.\n  I am convinced it is in the interest of this Senate, of this United \nStates, of my family, of your family, of the citizens of this country, \nthat we proceed forward in whatever fashion we must to assure that vote \ntakes place. I am convinced if we don't, the scenario of the inability \nto accede a Justice to the Supreme Court will cause irreparable harm to \nthe policies, the laws, and to the future of this country.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, I thank the Senator from North \nCarolina for his excellent statement.\n  I have been on the floor many times to talk about the issue of \njudicial nominations, to stand and speak in favor of many nominees to \nthe bench who have been debated over the past couple of years. Last \nnight, I had the opportunity to meet with Justices Janice Rogers Brown \nand Priscilla Owen. I expressed to them my personal sympathy for them \nand their families, as I do to all of those who have had their lives, \ncareers, and decisions unjustly dragged and contorted through the \nstreets of debate on the floor of the Senate.\n  Four years ago now, when Justice Owen was nominated, I am sure that \nwas a very proud day for her. I am sure she looked forward to the \nchallenges of the confirmation process and the challenges of serving in \nthe circuit court. I don't think anyone could possibly have conceived \nthat a person with her judicial standing, having been rated the highest \nqualified by the American Bar\n\n[[Page S5497]]\n\nAssociation, having served as a supreme court justice in one of the \nlargest States, having been elected in that State with over 80 percent \nof the vote, having accolades from Democrats and Republicans alike who \nhave served with her on the court, as well as public officials in \nTexas--I don't think she could have possibly imagined she would be \ninvolved as one of the focal points of this maelstrom we see pouring \nout here over the last few days and, unfortunately, over the last \ncouple years on the floor of the Senate.\n  These nominees have my respect. They have my respect for their \ncourage and for their perseverance. It has been an act of perseverance \non the part of many of them. All of them could have easily walked \naway--not that they don't have good jobs and great careers, and if not \nuniversally respected in the legal community, they are certainly highly \nrespected. They don't get nominated for these positions unless they are \nhighly respected within the community.\n  So I think it would have been very easy for many to walk away, but \nthey have not. They certainly have earned my respect, no matter what \nhappens here. I think it is a very sad day when we take highly \nqualified people who are willing to serve, and who have served in the \njudicial capacity, and treat them this way. We hear so much from the \nother side about many of us complaining about activist judges, and \nbeing critical of judges, and how it is a security threat to judges. \nWell, I suggest what we have been seeing over the last couple of years \nin the way these judges and their records have been distorted, they \nhave added to the sense of frustration of the American public as to our \njudiciary and our system of justice in this country.\n  We have an opportunity to correct that. We have an opportunity to \nstep away from the mistakes of the past in the next few days and to \nallow up-or-down votes on the floor of the Senate again. For 214 years, \n214 years--in this Chamber and the Chamber just down the hall, and once \nin a couple other places--in Washington and other places, such as \nPhiladelphia--we had votes by Senators who were elected at very \ndifficult times in our Nation's history, at contentious times, where \njudges had major roles to play on the issues of the day. Think back to \nthe times of slavery, during the early 1800s, when judges played a huge \nrole in this issue that eventually fractured this country. I am sure \nthere were times when either side, depending on who was the President \nand who controlled the Senate, felt it would have been unfair to their \ncause, the Northern cause or the Southern cause, to have a person on \nthe Supreme Court who would vote against their interests. I am \nconfident many felt very much tempted to vote and join a filibuster to \nblock a nomination to require a supermajority vote.\n\n  But if you think about it, it is remarkable they withheld from doing \nthat and chose instead something most people would say is much more \ndramatic, and that is to secede from the Union. But Senators, enduring \nthat very contentious time when there were fights on the floor of the \nSenate, understood that a very key part, an important part, essential \npart of the Senate is the process by which we govern ourselves; that \nthe process protects our rights; the process protects the system of \nGovernment. They chose to withhold their passions--the passions of the \nmoment for the issue of the day--for the right and controversy to do \nwhat was best for the institution of the Senate, the greatest \ndeliberative body in the history of the world, potentially.\n  And now we have seen this infection that entered into the bloodstream \nof the Senate. Whether you want to call it a partisan infection or an \nideological infection, there certainly is a sickness. I think it is a \nsickness that, candidly, both sides of the aisle feel. I don't know too \nmany people who feel very good about what we are going through on \neither side. It is making us all weaker, sicker, and it is so doing to \nthis institution. We need a cure. We had a pretty healthy institution \nwhen it came to this issue for 214 years. I think we can look to the \nprescription that we had for 214 years for a cure to what ails us in \nthis body today.\n  The Senator from North Carolina accurately said we had an agreement--\nhe used the term ``gentlemen's agreement''--a handshake, that this was \nthe way we were going to proceed. I argue those in the 1850s had the \nright to filibuster judges. Those in 2003 had the right to filibuster \njudges. I had the right, during the Clinton administration, to \nfilibuster his appointments. There were those whom I wanted to \nfilibuster and those whom I desperately didn't want to see on the \ncourt, and we stood down because in spite of the passions and in spite \nof what I thought was a mistake to put a particular person on a \nparticular court, there was something lasting, something more \nimportant, something certainly not eternal, but certainly eternal for \nas long as the United States shall survive, and that is this \ninstitution. We should not go mucking around in this institution and \nchanging the way we do things, particularly when it comes to the \nbalance of powers and the independence of one of the branches of our \nGovernment, the judiciary.\n  We must tread very carefully before we go radically changing the way \nwe do business here, which has served this country well. We have \nradically changed the way we do business here.\n  Some are suggesting we are trying to change the law, we are trying to \nbreak the rules. Remarkable hubris. Imagine, the rule that this is the \nway we confirm judges has been in place for 214 years, broken by the \nother side 2 years ago, and the audacity of some Members to stand up \nand say, How dare you break this rule, it is the equivalent of Adolf \nHitler in 1942 saying: I'm in Paris, how dare you invade me, how dare \nyou bomb my city. It's mine. This is no more the rule of the Senate \nthan it was the rule of the Senate before not to filibuster. It was an \nunderstanding, an agreement, and it has been abused.\n  In a sense, what we see on the floor of the Senate is a reflection of \nwhat we often see in our society. What we often see in our society is a \ngovernment that increasingly is passing laws. I get this from some of \nmy constituents sometimes. They say: You guys are always passing more \nand more laws and more and more laws, and ultimately when you are \npassing laws, in many cases what you are doing is restricting people's \nfreedom.\n  The more laws we have on the books, the more laws there are to obey, \nthe more laws you have the ability to break. So why do we do this? \nBecause we respond to problems in society that come about certainly, in \nmany cases, because what we once thought we did not need a law in place \nto keep people from doing, we now have laws in place to punish people \nwho heretofore understood it simply was not a good thing to do.\n  We did this recently with the corporate scandals. What did we do? We \npassed a huge law, Sarbanes-Oxley, in response to what? Activities by a \ngroup of people who simply forgot about the handshake, forgot about the \nduty we have to each other, and pushed the law well beyond what we \nintended. So we had to pass a new law, and we had to constrain 99 \npercent of the people in America who never even thought about breaking \nthe law or doing the things that were done by Enron and Tyco and all \nthose people. So we had to pass laws on everybody.\n  Was it a good thing to do? We had to pass the law because there were \nsome who could not live by the law, could not live civilly, could not \nlive with not just the letter of the law but the spirit of the law.\n  So we had to pass legislation that restricted freedom, that put \nburdens on people. That is why I have said many times I am not crazy \nabout having to vote to eliminate the possibility of filibusters on \njudges. I am not anxious to do this anymore than I was anxious to pass \nsome of the corporate responsibility provisions. One would like to \nthink, particularly here, where we are supposed to be a reflection of \nwhat is best in our society, that we can understand what we are doing \nhere is wrong and just step back from the ledge and let civility reign, \nlet the tradition of the Senate be upheld.\n  I do not want to have to pass a law. I want to see a Senate that can \nagree to act civilly, to respect tradition in the process of running \nthis place that has worked well for 214 years. That is what I want.\n  So I have encouraged many to sit down and try to negotiate. I \nencouraged our leaders to do so. I know our leader has tried \ndiligently. I just spoke with him on the phone a few minutes\n\n[[Page S5498]]\n\nago, and he continues to work to avoid what no one--at least I hope no \none in this Chamber--wants to see happen. I certainly do not. But we \ncan no longer live--just like we cannot live with the opportunity of \nthose to cheat shareholders and employees--we can no longer live with \nthe minority trying to cheat those nominated by the President of the \nUnited States from a fair up-or-down vote in the Senate. We cannot \ntolerate that. That is behavior beyond the pale. That is behavior that \nno Senate, prior to the last one, tolerated. None.\n  I have repeatedly asked and I know other people have asked \nrepeatedly, Name one judge brought to the floor of the Senate who had \nmajority support who was not confirmed. Name one, prior to 2 years ago. \nNever happened. Never happened in the entire history of the Senate. \nNever happened. We have 10, potentially 16 who would have that \nprivilege because of this new precedent.\n  I cannot understand how Members of the Senate can come here and say \nwhat we are doing is breaking the rules. Breaking the rules? I do not \nknow how you can possibly contort the facts of this case around to \nwhere the Senate Republicans, by returning to the tradition of the \nSenate of 214 years, is somehow breaking the rules.\n  This is truly a sad day. It has been a sad week. If you look and \nlisten to my constituents--and I am sure all of our constituents--they \nare not happy about this debate. They are not happy a group of 100 \nleaders--100 leaders--cannot negotiate and find some way of acting \ncivilly, of reflecting to our children and our grandchildren that we \nknow how to play nice and we know how to play by the rules.\n  But the passions of the moment, the passions of the moment have swept \nover us, and those groups out there that are fomenting this because of \ntheir own ideological agenda are the culprits, or at least the \nmotivation, but the votes are here. The votes are here. I am hopeful \nthere are enough on the other side of the aisle who will come to the \nrealization this is not good for them, this is not good for their \nideology, it is not good for their partisanship, this is not good for \nthe institution, and this is not good for the country to continue down \nthis path.\n\n  When I came to the Senate, I came from the House, like the Senator \nfrom Georgia, from the legislature, like the Presiding Officer. I had \nnever dealt with executive nominations before. So one of the things I \nlooked into is how do I determine what a good judge is. We did a little \nlooking around and determined how do you evaluate a judge.\n  First, are they qualified? Do they have the educational skills, the \nexperience to do the job? Second, are they ethical, not just did they \nbreak any laws, but are they ethical individuals and have a reputation \nfor high ethics? And three, do they have an understanding of the role \nof a judge? Those are the three things.\n  You did not hear me say, do I agree with them on this issue, this \nissue, or that issue, because my feeling is whoever is elected \nPresident will appoint people who agree with their philosophy. That is \nhow it works, just as when you appoint a Secretary of Veterans Affairs \nor a Secretary of Energy, you appoint someone who intellectually agrees \nwith your philosophy.\n  When President Clinton was elected, I came here, and I supported \nalmost every Clinton nominee. Did I agree with them? Absolutely not. \nDid I think most of them would be damaging to the court? Absolutely. \nDid I vote for them? Yes. There are a couple of exceptions. One in \nparticular, I have to tell you, who caused me a lot of heartburn was \nJudge Richard Paez from California who showed a record of activism on \nthe court that was upsetting to me and showed that he was not someone \nwho understood the role of a judge.\n  So under that he certainly was qualified, and I had no questions \nabout his ethics, but I did have a question as to whether he understood \nthe role of a judge. From his experience it showed me he did not.\n  There were many who wanted to filibuster Judge Paez because of that \nvery fact. In my mind, certainly from the standpoint of not wanting \nsomeone on the court, it would have been a justifiable filibuster, \nexcept for the fact that is not the way we do things in the Senate, \nbecause you know what. The President won the election, and he can \nnominate who he wants. And we in the Senate have had a tradition saying \nif you can get a majority of votes in the Senate, you get confirmed.\n  It is about majorities. And by the way, I voted for cloture on Judge \nPaez and voted against him on the floor when an up-or-down vote came. \nHe did not get 60 votes. Had we filibustered, he would not be on the \nNinth Circuit today. We did not. I did not because it was not the right \nthing to do. It was absolutely not the right thing to do.\n  I suggest that we have changed the qualifications from highly \nethical, highly qualified and understanding the role of a judge to \nsomeone who is ``in the mainstream.'' That seems to be the idea now. So \nwe are talking about ideology, in the ideological mainstream.\n  There were probably--well, Richard Paez, certainly from my view, I \nwould argue, is probably not in the ideological mainstream of America \nbut they all supported Judge Paez.\n  Probably Justice Harlan, who was the lone dissenter in 1896 in Plessy \nv. Ferguson, was not in the mainstream at the time.\n  Thurgood Marshall was confirmed in the Senate to the circuit court \nback in 1961 with 54 votes. As a lawyer for the NAACP in the 1950s, \nprobably a lot of people in America would not have said he was in the \nmainstream.\n  There are a lot of judges who are not ``in the mainstream'' depending \non what stream one happens to be swimming in.\n  Elections have consequences. In 1961, John F. Kennedy was the \nPresident. He won the election, and he got the benefit of the doubt on \nthe Senate floor. He got an up-or-down vote. Majorities matter. I do \nnot think my colleagues will hear the Senator from Georgia or any other \nSenator on this side of the aisle complain because for 18 months \nPriscilla Owen was held in the Senate Judiciary Committee during the \nchairmanship of Senator Leahy. I certainly will not complain. It was \nhis right not to report her nomination to the Senate floor. Why? \nBecause they were in the majority. If a majority of that committee did \nnot support her nomination, fine, hold it in committee. Defeat her in \ncommittee. That is fine. No problem.\n  If someone happens to be reported out and a majority defeats, fine, \nmajority rules. This idea that 60, 80 whatever Clinton nominees were \nheld in committee by Republicans during the last few years of the \nClinton administration, they were held because the majority opposed \nthem. The majority rules, up-or-down vote on majority vote. That is the \n214-year tradition of the Senate.\n  The idea now is the minority rules. One can lose the presidency, lose \nfour seats in the House and control who is going to be the next circuit \nand Supreme Court judges in the United States? Very interesting. I \nguess elections do not matter. I guess who people vote for, for \nPresident is of no concern to the minority in the Senate. They are the \nones who should dictate who the nominees of this President should be. \nThey are the ones who should dictate who comes to the floor and whether \nthey get a vote or not.\n  That is not the precedent of 214 years. It has been an up-or-down \nvote. This is an outrage. This is an abuse of power.\n  It is interesting we are in the Senate, and we are talking about the \nminority abusing power. Yes, the minority can abuse power in this case, \nand in my opinion they certainly have.\n  One final comment, and I apologize to the Senator from Georgia and I \nappreciate his patience. I just want to make a comment on one case. \nYesterday I heard the Senator from California make a statement with \nrespect to Janice Rogers Brown, one I am particularly concerned about \nbecause it deals with the issue of Catholic Charities. I heard the \nSenator from California in describing Justice Janice Rogers Brown's \ndecision in that case and she used the following words in describing \nher dissent: She, meaning Justice Brown, was the only member of the \ncourt who voted to strike down a State antidiscrimination law that \nprovided a contraceptive drug benefit to women. That is her comment.\n  Now, she did not go into the fact what this law said. What was this \nlaw? Well, it was a law that said that if an employer provided health \ninsurance they must provide contraceptive coverage--must. Now most \nfolks who have\n\n[[Page S5499]]\n\ndealt in this area before would say: Is there not an exemption for \nthose religious organizations who do not believe in contraception? The \nanswer is the California legislature did provide such an exception. Let \nme read the exception. It said that we will exclude from coverage for \ncontraceptive methods that are contrary to their religious tenets. \nSounds reasonable. We do that all the time. If it is contrary to \nreligious tenets of a religious organization, they do not have to offer \nthis particular kind of care.\n  As a Catholic, the tenets of the Catholic Church are that \ncontraceptives are wrong, and therefore they do not want to, according \nto their religious tenets, offer that service to their employees. Well, \nthis is the California exception for a religious employer: One, the \nentity whose purpose is the inculcation of religious values. Well, this \nis Catholic Charities. Is it Catholic Charities' role to inculcate \nreligious values? No. One of the key roles of the Catholic Church is to \ncare for the poor, to care for those who are less fortunate. It is a \nbasic and core value of the church. We hear it repeatedly offered by \nMembers on the other side.\n\n  We have discussions about the church and its theology, how core and \ncentral helping the poor is. So they do not qualify under that.\n  Two, that primarily employs persons who share its religious tenets. \nWell, Catholic Charities does not primarily employ people. They employ \npeople who want to serve the needs of the poor, and they do not ask \nwhether you want to go to church or not at a Catholic Church.\n  Three, that serves primarily persons who share those religious \ntenets--in other words, only Catholics. Obviously not. They serve \neveryone. Mother Teresa is the classic example of a Catholic out on the \nfront lines serving the needs of the poor irrespective of who they are.\n  Four, and qualifies as a church under a particular section of Federal \nlaw. Obviously, Catholic Charities is not a church. Under the religious \nexception of the California statute, Catholic charities is an arm \ndirectly under the control of the bishop, a mission of the church, not \na religious organization.\n  What Justice Brown said was that is an outrage, that is \nunconstitutional, it is against freedom of religion to suggest that a \nCatholic organization, Catholic Charities, under that construct, has to \noffer services in their health care plan. I will agree she was the sole \nperson but that is hardly striking down the rights of women to have \ncontraceptive services. This was an infringement upon the Religious \nLiberty Protection Act.\n  I find it very interesting a lot of folks come in here with their \nscorecards. Well, she voted against consumers this many times, she \nvoted against women this many times, she voted against this, as if \njudges are supposed to keep a scorecard as to who they vote for and \nagainst as opposed to following what the law says.\n  So if a consumer comes before a judge, they are supposed to be pro-\nconsumer? If a business person comes before a judge, they are supposed \nto be pro-business? Is that what my colleagues want judges to do, have \na scorecard and make sure they are 50-50 on all of these things?\n  These litmus tests that are being spewed from the other side are a \ncomplete undermining of what the rule of law is to be about, about what \njustice is to be about. They are infusing politics, policy, and \npartisanship in this process.\n  We must stop this. We must have up-or-down votes. I hope we do it in \na way that does not force us to vote to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I commend the Senator from Pennsylvania \non his remarks. For the moment that he is here, I want him to hear me \nsay something.\n  I make the remarks I am about to make with a full understanding, were \nI in the minority party and this another day, I would need to make \nexactly the same speech and take exactly the same position. You see, I \nam new here, but I have learned something very quickly. The words you \nsay today will be the words repeated to you tomorrow.\n  I learned something else. The genie came out of the bottle in the \n108th Congress. Whether it was Democrats or Republicans, one day \nsomebody would ultimately have to decide: Was the filibuster intended \nto be used on advice and consent?\n  With all due respect to everybody I have heard, it is just incorrect \nto say that to do away with the filibuster is going to make us a \nrubberstamp body.\n  Go ask Clarence Thomas if this place was a rubberstamp body, or \nJustice Bork. Think about the confirmations, most contentious in the \nlast 20 years. Nobody invoked a filibuster. One of those justices was \nconfirmed. One was not.\n  There are many responsibilities of the Senate that are designated in \nthe Constitution. Impeachment is one. Whoever heard anybody \nfilibustering an impeachment? Did you? The Constitution says the Senate \nwill conduct that trial, as it says the Senate will advise and consent \non treaties--by two-thirds majority. And on justices of the court--\nsimple. It doesn't say maybe. It doesn't say if you feel like it. It is \nnot even confusing. I have it in my pocket. I read it right before I \ncame over here just to make sure I hadn't missed something because I \nheard twice today people say this document, the Constitution, doesn't \nsay things that it does say.\n\n  I rise also, understanding how important the words are, because the \nsecond speech I made in the Senate, the first week of February this \nyear, there was nobody in the Chamber. I've got a bigger crowd with the \nSenator from Pennsylvania than I had. It was early in the morning. It \nwasn't much of a gallery. I figured nobody was listening. The \ndistinguished Democratic leader quoted me seven times since I made that \nspeech.\n  I want to address that quote for a second.\n  You see, I told the story of being in Baghdad and talking to a Sunni, \na Shiite, and a Kurd and asking the Kurd: Well, now that you are in the \nminority, aren't you scared the Shiites are going to run over you? And \nhe said: Oh, no, we will use filibuster.\n  I thought that was a great remark. Here was a Kurd from the north of \nIraq, in a place that had just won its liberty thanks to the blood, \nsweat, and tears of the United States of America, and he was reading \nAdams and Jefferson and studying us.\n  The next thing I know, the distinguished Mr. Reid from Nevada says I \nsaid that to endorse a debate over whether or not the filibuster should \nbe used on the confirmation of a judge.\n  I don't blame him. But just so the record is set straight, he is \nquoting a Kurd who read about America, who is in the process of writing \ntheir constitution which, I presume when it is finished, will provide \nfor a filibuster over issues but not a filibuster to be used to \nobstruct the justice of the new democratic nation of Iraq.\n  I know my time is short. But I want to make some observations. I want \nto make my remarks in the context of Justice Brown. I know that Mrs. \nOwen is the current topic of discussion, about which at some point in \ntime we hope there will be a vote, but Janice Rogers Brown is around \nthe corner, and I felt like, after listening to all these debates, \nnobody is really talking about anybody's qualifications. Have you \nnoticed that?\n  Even one of the deals that was offered was: tell you what, we will \napprove any five, you just give us two we are not going to approve.\n  Does that tell you they care anything about qualifications? Why, if \nyou thought there was an unqualified judge, would you let the other \nside pick five and not pick two? I don't think qualifications are the \nissue. I understand that. That is another reason why I say this is not \na superfluous argument, were we in the minority and it was still being \ndecided, and had the roles been on the other side. And it is important \nthat we decide it today.\n  Janice Rogers Brown was born in 1949 in the Deep South. I was born in \n1944 in the Deep South.\n  When Janice Rogers Brown was born, I don't know that her parents ever \nenvisioned that she would be a supreme court justice in the State of \nCalifornia. When I was born, I doubt my parents envisioned that I would \nbe a Senator. However, in 1944, for a male white child born in the \nSouth, it was possible to be a Senator. In 1949, in the South, in \nAlabama or Georgia, it would not have\n\n[[Page S5500]]\n\nbeen possible for a parent to dream that for a female black child.\n  In my lifetime of studying this body, the most prevalent use of the \nfilibuster was by southerners in the debates over the civil rights laws \nin the 1960s. The filibuster was used to protract the ultimate passage \nof those laws. It finally failed. Our country did what was right and \nthose laws were passed.\n  I would hope that today the filibuster would not be used to deny an \nup-or-down vote on Janice Rogers Brown because every parent deserves to \ndream for every child that they will have the chance--not the \nguarantee--but the chance. These justices who have been nominated by \nour President deserve an up-or-down vote. No one in here has challenged \nanybody's right to vote yes or no. But they have challenged the fact \nthat, yes, every one of them deserves a vote, and that is what this \ndebate is all about.\n  So, as one who is new to this Chamber but understands how important \nthis debate is, I rise to repeat that I will vote to support a vote, up \nor down, on every nominee. Understanding that, were I in the minority \nparty and the issues reversed, I would take exactly the same position \nbecause this document, our Constitution, does not equivocate. It \ndesignates that responsibility to the Senate. I repeat, we are not \nbreaking an old rule, we are addressing an issue that was raised in the \nlast Congress as to where the filibuster would apply. It must be \ndecided, and we must be diligent in our debate, respectful of the \ndifferences of opinions but, in the end, understanding of our \nresponsibility as Members of the Senate and those elected to represent \nthose who brought us here.\n  Madam President, I see my time is about up. If the Chair will inform \nme, I believe I have 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I will close by going to a quote I heard earlier today \nby the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts, who talked about the \nhistory of judicial confirmation, and my understanding of history is \nthe same as his. The distinguished Senator said the first two times our \nFounding Fathers worried about writing the Constitution, they were \ngoing to designate the appointment of judges to the Senate. It was only \non the third meeting that, at the Constitutional Convention, they \ndetermined it be a joint responsibility: Nomination by the President, \nconfirmation by the Senate.\n  The distinguished Senator is absolutely correct. He described it as a \ndual responsibility. It would be irresponsible for the Senate to avoid \nexpressing itself in advice and consent on the qualification of any \nnominee. To do anything other than that which the Constitution \ndesignates to us would be to abrogate our responsibility. Our Founding \nFathers were right over 200 years ago, and our leader, whom I commend, \nis right today. I hope when this debate ends, whether through \nnegotiations or a vote, the men and women nominated to the Federal \nbench of the United States of America will know, not that they are \nguaranteed a judgeship, but they are guaranteed to know how the Members \nof the Senate voted on whether or not they would be confirmed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I yield myself 7 minutes and then will \nyield to the Senator from New Mexico 15 minutes immediately after me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, as most have said, we believe we have \nbeen more than fair. We have confirmed 95 percent of the President's \njudges. As I have said before, if my daughter came home with a 95 on \nher report card, I would say, great. What some on the other side want \nto say is this: Only got a 95? Break the rules and get 100.\n  We do not believe in that and would like to exhibit in the most \ngraphic way how we have supported 208 of the 218 judges by doing \nsomething very simple--by reading the names of the 208 judges the \nPresident has nominated and gotten approved by this Senate.\n     1.

Morrison England, ED CA\n\n  Madam President, I am illustrating how many judges--208 to 10--we \nhave approved in this Senate, an outstanding 95-percent record, nothing \nthat any President should complain about.\n  We will continue the reading later.\n  I yield the floor to my friend and colleague from New Mexico, Senator \nBingaman.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I thank my friend from New York and \ncongratulate him on his leadership on this very important issue.\n  I find it very unfortunate that disagreements about judicial \nappointments have brought us to the point where the majority is ready \nto take away the longstanding right of each and every Senator to \nunlimited debate. That is a very major change in the way business has \ntraditionally and historically been done in the Senate.\n  This is a confrontation that could easily have been avoided by the \nPresident and his legal counsel if they had been willing to follow what \nI understand to be the normal practice that historically has prevailed \nand should prevail. Someone asked: What is that normal practice? It is \nsimply the practice of consulting with the Senators most involved in \nthe nominating process before making a final decision on which \nindividuals to nominate.\n  In the case of judicial nominees for Federal court positions in my \nState of New Mexico, and also positions to be filled on the Tenth \nCircuit Court of Appeals that are designated for New Mexico attorneys, \nI have been contacted, and I have been asked if I had objections to \nperspective nominees in each case before a final decision to nominate \nhas been made. And that is not just in the last year or 2, this is over \nthe 22-plus years I have served in the Senate. As far as I can \nremember, I have been afforded that courtesy each time. We, the Senate, \nhave confirmed; and Presidents Reagan and Bush, Sr., and Clinton and \nnow George W. Bush have nominated many individuals for the Federal \ncourt in my State during that time.\n  It is also my understanding that more often than not the chair and \nthe\n\n[[Page S5501]]\n\nranking member of the Judiciary Committee have been afforded that same \ncourtesy prior to the nomination of individuals to court of appeals \npositions or to a Supreme Court position. Much of the current \nconfrontation and rancor could have been sidestepped if that practice \nhad been followed with respect to the nominees who are currently in \ndispute. Unfortunately, this President has chosen a different course.\n  Rather than consulting before a nomination is made, the White House \nhas chosen to make nominations that it knows will be highly \ncontroversial, in some cases where it knows that the Senators from the \nnominee's State are strongly opposed to that nominee. Where nominations \nhave been blocked during one Congress, the 108th Congress, last \nCongress, the President has chosen to renominate those same individuals \nin the succeeding Congress.\n  Madam President, this is not a strategy to unite rather than divide \nthe country. This is a strategy to split and to polarize the Senate and \nthe American people, and it is clearly having that exact effect.\n  Given where we are, I, like most of my colleagues, feel obliged to \ncome to the Senate floor and speak on this so-called nuclear option. In \nmy view, this is a misguided effort that will not only harm the Senate, \nit will also have a significant impact on the checks and balances that \nour Founding Fathers envisioned. I am disappointed that the majority \nleader has decided to pursue this course of action. I regret that he \nhas repeatedly rejected the minority leader's offers to compromise on \nthe issue.\n  There are two distinct issues I want to discuss briefly today. The \nfirst is the manner in which the change is being made, the idea that \nthe majority can simply change longstanding Senate rules whenever it \nbelieves it would be expedient to do so. I find that notion deeply \ntroubling. We are a nation of laws, and our institutions need to \nreflect this.\n  The second issue I want to discuss is the merits of the proposal and \nthe impact of eliminating the ability to filibuster. The use of the \nfilibuster not only ensures that minority views are respected in the \nSenate, it also plays an important role in checking the power of the \nexecutive branch and in ensuring that the judiciary remains \nindependent.\n  Let me take a moment to briefly describe what this nuclear option \nentails. I recognize that discussing rules and procedures is not an \nexciting topic, but it is important that the American public understand \nprecisely what is being done. This is not about whether every nominee \nshould get an up-or-down vote. It is about whether it is acceptable for \nthe majority party to disregard longstanding Senate rules in order to \nget its way in each and every case that comes before the Senate.\n  Senate rule V states that:\n\n       The rules of the Senate shall continue from one Congress to \n     the next Congress unless they are changed as provided in \n     these rules.\n\n  In accordance with Senate rule XXII, any such change can only be made \nwith the approval of two-thirds of all Senators elected. That is 67 \nSenators.\n  Requiring continuity of the rules from Congress to Congress, and \nrequiring that changes to the rules meet a threshold vote well above a \nsimple majority, has a very straightforward purpose. It ensures that \nthe rules governing the Senate remain constant, that they are not \nchanged whenever one party believes the rules are hampering their \nability to get their way in the short term.\n  Some in the majority party have complained that it is necessary to \nchange the rules with respect to use of the filibuster on judicial \nnominees because in their view the current 60-vote requirement to end \ndebate is too high. I have no objection to debating that issue and \nbringing it to a vote. Indeed, throughout the Senate's history there \nhave been a variety of proposals to modify the rules governing the \nfilibuster.\n  For example, in 1975, the Senate reduced the number of votes required \nto end debate from 67 to 60. In 1995, I supported a proposal Senator \nHarkin offered which did not pass but would have revised the procedure. \nSo why is not the majority leader bringing this proposal, which he is \nnow threatening to make, up for a vote under normal procedure? Simply \nput, he does not have the votes to pass the measure if we stick by the \nrules of the Senate, the 67-vote rules of the Senate.\n\n  So his proposal is simple: If you do not have the votes to pass the \nproposal using the rules as they exist, then make up your own rules so \nyou can pass it. Under this procedural maneuver, if the Senate votes to \nnot end debate on one of the disputed nominees, the majority leader \nintends to make a point of order requesting that the Presiding Chair, \nwho will likely be the Vice President, rule that only 51 votes are \nneeded to confirm appellate and Supreme Court nominees.\n  Now, all of us know, and it is very clear to everyone who has studied \nthis issue, that is not what the Parliamentarian would rule. The \nParliamentarian has said just the opposite. Democrats will object, but \nthe ruling would be upheld by a simple majority vote. It is my \nunderstanding this would be the first time that we have changed the \nrules of the Senate without following the prescribed procedure for \ndoing so in the rules that we have adopted. This would entail \noverruling the Senate Parliamentarian.\n  Madam President, I have to ask, what is the meaning of a rule if it \nis permissible to break it when one disagrees with the outcome that \nwould result if the rule were followed? If the majority leader wants to \ntry to modify the filibuster, he has the right to attempt that, but he \nshould do so within the parameters of the Senate rules. It is dangerous \nto set a precedent of ignoring those rules that govern how we go about \nchanging rules.\n  Indeed, if one rule can be changed this way with a simple majority \nvote, why not others as well?\n  The majority leader has argued that the Senate's record of processing \nthe President's judicial nominees is so egregious that it justifies \nbreaking the rules and disregarding over 200 years of precedent in \norder to get more nominees confirmed. Let's examine this record. My \ncolleague from New York has already discussed at length the number of \njudges, appellate court judges, district court judges, we have approved \nin this Senate since this President has been in office.\n  We have the lowest vacancy rate in the Federal judiciary since \nPresident Reagan was in office. The Senate has confirmed 95 percent of \nthe President's nominees. In addition, Democrats have offered to bring \nup several of the disputed nominees for consideration, which would \nbring the confirmation rate closer to 98 percent. Unfortunately, the \nmajority leader has rejected that proposed compromise.\n  Some have also asserted that Democrats are charting new ground in \nfilibustering judicial nominees. Frankly, this is just incorrect. It is \ncontrary to the history of the Senate. Republicans did filibuster Abe \nFortas in 1968 when he was nominated to be the Chief Justice of the \nU.S. Supreme Court. The filibuster was successful. He ultimately \nwithdrew his nomination from consideration.\n  I agree we have an obligation to process the President's judicial \nnominees in a fair and judicious manner, and, as the record \ndemonstrates, that is exactly what we have been trying to do.\n  However, I do understand the general frustration surrounding the \nprocessing of judicial nominees. During the Clinton administration, the \nRepublican majority, during several of those years, killed over 60 \nnominees through a variety of delay tactics, mostly by refusing to give \nhearings in the Judiciary Committee. As a result, many of those \nnominees never got a chance to have a fair and open debate about their \nqualifications, much less a vote on the Senate floor.\n  I believe we should look for ways to improve the confirmation process \nso that it is conducted in a more bipartisan and constructive manner. \nBut exercising the so-called nuclear option is not a step in the right \ndirection. Let's be clear on what this is about. It is about setting \nthe stage for the debate over the next Supreme Court Justice. It is \nabout putting in place a procedure that would limit the ability of \nDemocrats and moderate Republicans to influence the debate. There would \nbe little need to consult or to compromise if the nominee could be \npushed through the Senate with a straight majority vote.\n  As I have discussed, I strongly disagree with the tactics that have \nbeen\n\n[[Page S5502]]\n\nchosen here to make these changes. With regard to the merits of the \nproposal to eliminate the filibuster for judicial nominees, I would \nlike to take a moment to elaborate on the profound implications of \nmoving forward with this effort. I believe such a change would be not \nonly detrimental to the Senate as an institution but will also result \nin significant deterioration of the checks and balances that ensure the \nindependence of our judiciary.\n  Having a procedure in place that allows 40 Senators to keep a nominee \nor legislation from being adopted serves many purposes. Most important, \nit facilitates compromise by guaranteeing the minority a voice in the \nlegislative process. Unlike in the House of Representatives, where \nlegislation can be easily pushed through with a simple majority vote, \nthe Senate is an institution where deliberation and compromise are \nabsolutely essential.\n  Forcing Senators to achieve common ground in order to complete the \npeople's work is something that should be encouraged. Bipartisanship \nhas been in short supply in recent years, and we need to be looking for \nways to work together to address the challenges we face in America.\n  I have had the privilege of representing the people of New Mexico for \nover 22 years now in the Senate. I recognize the importance of working \nacross the aisle to achieve results. Earlier this week, we held the \nfirst of several hearings on comprehensive energy legislation to try to \nmark up legislation in that area. I am extremely encouraged by how \nmembers of the committee from both parties have been working together. \nIt is my hope that bipartisanship and sense of compromise can be \nadopted elsewhere in the Senate. This exemplifies how we should be \nfacilitating more compromise between the majority and minority parties.\n  The filibuster is not only an important check on the majority power \nwithin the Senate, but it is also an essential check on the executive \nbranch. Article II, section 2 of the U.S. Constitution provides the \nSenate and the President shall share the power to appoint judicial \nnominees. The President is granted the authority to nominate. The \nSenate is vested with the authority to provide its advice and consent. \nThis is a serious constitutional duty. I do not believe the Senate \nshould be relegated to the role of a glorified rubberstamp. That is not \nwhat the American people want, not what the Founding Fathers \nenvisioned.\n  The prospect of a filibuster forces the President to submit nominees \nto the Senate who will be able to garner the support of more than a \nsimple majority of that President's own party. There are plenty of \nwell-qualified, conservative lawyers and judges who would easily be \nconfirmed by this Senate. In fact, the Senate has confirmed over 200 of \nthem since this President has been in office. At the beginning of this \nCongress, the President chose to resubmit several of the most \ncontroversial nominees who lacked widespread support, rather than to \nheed the concerns that had been raised about their nominations. The \nSenate has coequal responsibilities in the appointment process. It is \nimportant for the administration to recognize this when it decides \nwhich nominees to send to the Senate for consideration.\n  Without the filibuster, the President would essentially be free to \nappoint whomever he wants to the Federal judiciary with very little \nrestraint. This would threaten the independence of the judiciary, which \nis charged with checking the actions of the executive and legislative \nbranches, by allowing a President to stack the courts with individuals \nwilling to advance a particular agenda or ideology.\n  If the same party controls the Senate and the White House, as is the \ncase today, the ability to filibuster is a primary restraint on the \nmajority party of using its power in the nomination and confirmation \nprocess. As the Framers recognized, it is reasonable to require that a \nlifetime appointee have the support of a substantial percentage of \nSenators who have been elected.\n\n  There is a reason why the Framers granted the Senate and not the \nHouse of Representatives the constitutional authority to provide advice \nand consent. The Senate's procedures ensure extended debate and respect \nfor minority views, which in turn facilitate compromise and moderation. \nI personally believe that having qualified and reasonable judges in the \nFederal judiciary, regardless of political party, who interpret the law \nobjectively and in accordance with mainstream legal theory is a good \nthing. These are lifetime appointments, which deserve rigorous debate \nand substantial scrutiny. This scrutiny would be significantly \ndiminished if the majority party could appoint whoever they want to the \njudiciary without concern for the views of the minority. And the \nindependence of the judiciary would be threatened if judges approach \ntheir work with a particular concern for carrying out the will of the \nparty in power at that moment.\n  It is not surprising that a President would seek to expand his \nauthority in the appointment process. But it is disappointing to think \nthat the Senate might accede to this and abrogate its own \nconstitutional authority in exercising its obligation to provide advice \nand consent.\n  Lastly, the proponents of the nuclear option have said they only want \nto eliminate the filibuster with regard to nominees, not with regard to \nlegislation. But nothing about their reasoning is unique to nominees. \nIf this can be done with regard to judicial nominees, it can certainly \nbe done with regard to executive branch nominees as well. And there is \nno logic for arguing it cannot be done with regard to legislation.\n  As I have stated, I have many concerns about employing this tactic \nand disregarding Senate tradition. I urge my colleagues across the \naisle to seriously consider the ramifications of this so-called nuclear \noption. It is not good for the Senate, it is not good for the delicate \nchecks and balances that govern our Government, and it is not in the \ninterest of the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The Senator from Maryland is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to speak against this so-called \nnuclear option. This is a sad day for the Senate because I believe we \nare about to fracture 200 years of precedent and tradition. I think we \nare about to fracture what I had hoped would be a bipartisan approach \nto solving the compelling problems we face in the United States of \nAmerica, and the Republicans are about to change the rules in the \nmiddle of the game.\n  One of the hallmarks of the United States of America is always fair \nplay. And fair play means a belief and respect for the rules because we \nare a nation that believes in rules and in the rule of law. Whenever we \nare in competitive situations, we believe in rules. You don't change \nthe rules in the middle of the game. You don't change the rules in a \ngame you are losing. But here especially there is no reason to change \nbecause the Bush administration is not losing. They have had more \nnominees confirmed than almost any other Administration in recent \nhistory.\n  This is a manufactured crisis. There are those who say there is a \ncrisis in terms of confirming judges. There is no crisis. George Bush \nis not losing. Right now, right this minute, we have confirmed 208 of \nthe President's nominees for the bench. That is a 95-percent \nconfirmation rate. I would think that getting 95% of what you want \nwould make you declare victory. But, oh, no, that is not good enough. \nThere is a desire to change the rules so that the President gets 100% \nand we cannot exercise our constitutional responsibility of advise and \nconsent.\n  Now I know that many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle \ndon't want to change the Senate rules. They know the ebbs and flows of \nthis institution one day you are in the majority and the next in the \nminority. And they know its not fair to change the rules in the middle \nof the game because doing so undermines century of tradition and the \nvery essence of the Senate as the world's premier deliberative body.\n  So I have come to the floor today to urge my colleagues to oppose \nthis so-called nuclear option. I do this because I firmly believe in my \nheart of hearts that we must always have an independent judiciary and a \njudiciary that has been confirmed according to the traditional roles of \nthe Senate. I know it is one of my foremost responsibilities as a \nmember of the United States Senate to protect the independence and \nintegrity of our federal courts. Because our courts are charged with \nsafeguarding the very principles on which\n\n[[Page S5503]]\n\nour nation was built--justice, equality and individual liberty.\n  The courthouse door must always stay open. And when someone walks \nthrough that door, they must find an independent judiciary. In order to \ndo that, we cannot turn the Senate into a rubberstamp for any \nadministration. We must not compromise our constitutional checks and \nbalances over 7 highly controversial judges. The American people \ndeserve better and, and the Constitution requires it.\n  When Alexander Hamilton and others were at the Constitutional \nConvention inventing America, they wanted checks and balances. They \nwanted no one to have absolute power, they wanted no individual to have \nabsolute power, and they wanted no institution within our Government to \nhave absolute power. That is why we have the system of checks and \nbalances. That is why the greatest check and balance is the advice and \nconsent role given to the Senate. The President nominates and the \nSenate has an important co-equal role to play in the confirmation \nprocess.\n  So the Senate has a very real and critical role to play here. It \ncan't rubber stamp nominees. It can't give consent without a thorough \nexamination and it should not support nominees who don't respect basic \njudicial principles.\n  When we are talking about this, we say, What does it mean? Who has \nbeen nominated? Who has been confirmed? Whom have we opposed? I have \ngiven the statistics. Since the President has been in office the Senate \nhas confirmed 208 of his nominees and rejected only 10. That's 95 \npercent approval and those we have rejected have been among the most \ncontroversial and extreme nominees. Nominees who did not represent the \nmainstream of American legal thought. Nominees hostile to civil rights, \nwomen's rights, reproductive rights and working families.\n  Let's talk about the 208. Let's talk about working on a bipartisan \nbasis. Let's talk about Maryland.\n  There were three openings on the Federal bench in Maryland for the \ndistrict court. Governor Ehrlich sent forth three names of outstanding \npeople of judicial competency. Senator Sarbanes and I moved them \nstraightforward and ahead, even though one had been the chairman of the \nRepublican Party. We did not care about that. Second, he had even run \nfor attorney general. We did not care about that. What we cared about \nwas that the Maryland Bar Association said he was qualified.\n  No. 2, he had been a U.S. attorney and had done a stunning job, and \nhe had extensive legal background in Maryland. We did not play \npolitics. We moved Judge Bennett, Judge Quarles, and Judge Titus.\n  Then came the court of appeals. Oh, my gosh, guess what came out of \nthe Bush administration. They wanted to give us a guy who was not even \na member of the Maryland bar. Sarbanes and Mikulski said no. That is \none of the ones that did not even come up. Why? We think if you are \ngoing to represent Maryland on the court of appeals, you ought to be a \nmember of the Maryland bar and have some significant ties to Maryland. \nWe threatened a filibuster.\n  This is the Maryland seat on the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. \nThey wanted to give us someone from Virginia. We like Virginia, Senator \nWarner, Senator Allen. We like judges from Virginia, but not for the \nMaryland seat. And Senator Sarbanes and I said we would filibuster. So \nwe stopped, prevent our state from losing its seat on the court of \nappeals because of the Senate rules.\n  Though some of them never came forth as nominees, we knew we had the \nrules of the Senate to prevent this injustice to Maryland. We invited \nthe White House to look at the thousands of lawyers in Maryland who are \nmembers of the bar, who have judicial competence and judicial \ntemperament and commitment to basic constitutional principles. Maryland \nwould recognize them.\n  But we were ready to use these rules in the Senate to protect the \nMaryland seat and make sure whoever was on the court of appeals for the \nMaryland seat would at least be a member of the Maryland bar or at \nleast be from Maryland and have significant ties there.\n  Those are the rules. That is how you exercise advice and consent. We \ngave advice, they ignored it, so they were not going to get our \nconsent. Hey, those are the rules. We do not want those rules changed, \nand it would be the same if there was a Democrat in the White House.\n  We could look at the nominees President Bush has given us. Not only \ndo we get people who are not members of a bar, but we get some who are \noutside the judicial mainstream.\n  Judge Priscilla Owen is an example of someone who would turn our \ncourts in the wrong direction. She has a history of being driven by \nideology and not law. Her beliefs are far outside the mainstream of \njudicial thinking. She has an extreme ideological agenda on civil \nrights, women's rights and the right to privacy that we severely \nquestion and make her unsuitable to sit on this federal court.\n  She is a judicial activist, that means she has a consistent pattern \nof putting ideology about the law and ignoring statutory language and \nsubstituting her own views. Something about which even officials in \nthis White House have raised concern. Alberto Gonzales, now our \nAttorney General, who once served with her, called her dissent in a \ncase ``unconscionable . . . judicial activism'' and in another case \nsaid her dissent would judicially amend the Texas statute. In other \nwords, she was making law rather than interpreting law.\n  Her opinions show a bias against consumers, victims and individuals. \nShe has consistently ruled against workers, accident victims and \nvictims of discrimination. Her decisions impair the rights of ordinary \npeople to have access to the courts. On the Texas Supreme Court she has \nrestricted a woman's right to choose by ignoring statute and creating \nadditional barriers for women seeking to exercise reproductive choice.\n  We could go through Owen, and we could go through others. Priscilla \nOwen stands among a handful of nominees who will turn back the clock on \nprotecting important constitutional rights. We know through our \nexamination of these nominees that they are outside the judicial \nmainstream, and we want to exercise our priority and our responsibility \non advice and consent. And now Republicans want to focus on the jobs of \n7 people who already have jobs when we have 7.7 million Americans who \ndon't.\n\n  They want the change the subject away from issue that Americans care \nabout to a handful of extreme judicial nominees. They say there is a \ncrisis but there are more federal judges now than at any other point in \nour nation's history. This is the lowest vacancy rate on the courts in \na decade. Republicans have the wrong priorities.\n  I had to explain what this nuclear option means to a head of state. \nDid you ever have to explain to someone who is a former head of a \ngovernment in a European country, who himself fought for freedom and \nwas a dissident and even in prison, what a nuclear option means? He \nthought we were talking about using nuclear weapons.\n  I had to explain this to members of my family, the senior citizens in \nmy family. ``Barb, what is this nuclear option? Are we thinking about \nusing nuclear weapons?'' We use language here very glibly, and I think \nexaggerated. What I said was we are headed for a meltdown. We cannot \nlet the Senate melt down, and we will melt down if we do not stop these \nproceedings from going forth. We need to have an institution that \nfunctions on a bipartisan basis.\n  Some of the happiest and most distinguished accomplishments of my \nlife have been accomplished because of working on a bipartisan basis. \nIn the 1990s, I worked with the Senator from Colorado, Mr. Hank Brown, \nand we worked to bring Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic into \nNATO. We had to stand up to a Democrat such as Senator Moynihan and a \nRepublican such as Senator Warner to get the Senate to consider it, but \nwe worked on a bipartisan basis, and we extended NATO from old Europe \nto a new Europe. And right now, the people we brought into NATO are \nfighting with us side by side in Iraq and are part of the coalition of \nthe willing. Bipartisan relationships did that.\n  Because of our work in the Senate where the women get together at \nleast once a month to have dinner for friendship and fellowship and to \ntalk about\n\n[[Page S5504]]\n\nan agenda, we have done a lot on women's health. We have increased \nmammogram funding research by 700 percent. We have increased funding \nfor domestic violence. We have done all this when we worked together.\n  My gosh, when we work together we work our best. Let us now stop this \ndangerous course. We should not continue further on this terrible down \nthis path on which we are embarking. The American people want us to be \nstanding up for jobs. They want us to be able to face straightforward \nthe health care crisis, and they want to make sure we stabilize the \npension crisis in the United States of America. Young people want to be \nable to afford college. They wonder what are we doing here. Republicans \nare spending all this time on the nuclear option and debating 7 \ncontroversial nominees instead of focusing on our national priorities. \nWhen all is said and done, is will be that more gets said than gets \ndone?\n  Let's put the nuclear arsenal option back into the missile silo. We \nmust do so to preserve the constitutional role of the Senate to advise \nand consent and protect our checks and balances.\n  Let's get back to doing the business of the people. The American \npeople deserve that and they deserve a Senate that works for them. A \nSenate that governs best when it works together, and let's start \nputting the people first rather than politics.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, last week on Wednesday, we evacuated the \nCapitol. At the instruction of the Capitol Police, more than a few \nSenators and staff actually ran from this building and surrounding \noffices in the very real fear that a plane was carrying a bomb to \nattack this building, the center of our democracy.\n  Sadly, Wednesday was not the first time, and Wednesday will likely \nnot be the last time, that we guard against threats to our democracy by \nplane or by bomb.\n  But there are other threats to our democracy and our freedoms just as \nmenacing, equally as dangerous.\n  Abraham Lincoln said:\n\n       America will never be destroyed from the outside. If we \n     falter and lose our freedoms, it will be because we destroyed \n     ourselves.\n\n  Former Librarian of Congress Daniel Boorstin said:\n\n       It is not slogans or bullets, but only institutions that \n     can make and keep people free.\n\n  And Baron Montesquieu wrote in ``The Spirit of the Laws'':\n\n       There is no liberty, if the judiciary power be not \n     separated from the legislative and the executive.\n\n  The effort to break the rules to allow the President more easily to \nappoint judges that undermine the independence of the Federal judiciary \nis no less than a threat to our democracy, a threat to our freedoms, \nand a threat to our liberties.\n  For two centuries, Democrats and Republicans alike have used the \nSenate's rules to protect our democracy, to protect our freedoms, and \nto protect our liberties. After two centuries, it would be a mistake to \nchange those rules.\n  Unlimited debate allows Senators to protect minority freedoms. \nUnlimited debate helps to ensure that no one party has absolute power. \nUnlimited debate helps to give effect to the Founders' conception of \nchecks and balances.\n  History will see the actions of this month as what they are: A threat \nto those checks and balances. History will see the actions of this \nmonth as a terrible attempt to diminish the Senate. History will see \nthe actions of this month as an attempt to diminish our democracy.\n  If those who seek to change the rules succeed, especially by breaking \nthe rules, it will be only a matter of time before the next step comes. \nIt will be only a matter of time before some future Senate leader \ndecides to once again to break the rules to change the rules, and \nabolish the filibuster altogether.\n  And what will the Senate look like then?\n  Then all our votes will be simple majority votes. Then lost will be a \ncenturies-old check and balance. And then what will be left will be a \nvastly different Senate from the one to which I came in 1978.\n  The majority leader has proposed that debate on important judges be \nlimited to a fixed number of hours, to 100 hours. That might sound like \na lot of time.\n  But the point is not the number of hours. The point is that at the \nend of a set amount of time, no Member of the minority party need \nparticipate. At the end of a set amount of time, only the majority \nparty will rule. At the end of that set amount of time, there would be \nno more check and balance.\n  If one wants to see what the Senate will look like then, look at \nbudget resolutions. Like the majority leader's proposed rule, they \nallow for a long period of debate. The leader's proposal calls for 100 \nhours of debate on judges. The Budget Act calls for 50 hours of debate \non budgets.\n  Look at the results.\n  Rarely do budget resolutions achieve consensus. Since 1992, only one \nbudget resolution has received more than 55 votes on final passage.\n  This year, the vote on the budget resolution was 52-to-47.\n  Last year, the disagreements on the budget were so partisan that the \nmajority was not able to bring the conference report on the budget \nresolution to the floor in the Senate.\n  In 2003, the vote was as close as it could get: 51-to-50. The Vice \nPresident had to break the tie vote.\n  In 2002, once again, divisions were so partisan that the majority was \nnot able to secure a majority in the Senate.\n  In 2001, the vote was 53-to-47\n  In 2000, the vote was 50-to-48.\n  In 1999, the vote was 54-to-44.\n  In 1998, the majority was once again unable to adopt a budget \nresolution.\n  And 1997 was the exception that proved the rule. That year, the \nbudget resolution achieved a broad consensus, receiving a vote of 76-\nto-22.\n  But in 1996, the vote was 53-to-46.\n  In 1995, the vote was 54-to-46.\n  In 1994, the vote was 53-to-46.\n  In 1993, the vote was 55-to-45.\n  And in 1992, the vote was 52-to-41.\n  Thus, over 14 years, under Republican Presidents and a Democratic \nPresident, over the course of nearly a decade and a half, only one \nbudget resolution has been the product of consensus. Fourteen years, \nand only one budget with more than 55 votes.\n  The time limit on debate has not led to working together. The time \nlimit on debate has caused partisanship. And three times in the last \ndecade, the time limit on debate has led to complete failure.\n  That is what would happen to the Senate if we head down this road. \nVotes would become more partisan, if that is possible, but it would \nhappen. And the products of those votes would become more extreme.\n  If we head down this road for the confirmation of judges, then judges \nwill be more partisan. Judges will be more likely to uphold the powers \nof the President who appointed them. And judges will be less likely to \ndefend individual freedoms and liberties against the powerful \nexecutive.\n  Just think about that for a moment. Under this rule change, judges \nwill be less likely to defend individual freedoms and liberties against \nthe powerful executive. Why? Because of the partisan nature under which \na partisan President will have appointed them.\n  The Senate's role in protecting against extremism is particularly \nimportant in the context of nominations for the lifetime jobs of \nFederal judges. The Founders wanted the courts to be an independent \nbranch of Government, helping to exercise the Constitution's intricate \nsystem of checks and balances. The Senate's involvement in the \nconfirmation of judges has helped to ensure that the judiciary can be \nthat more independent branch. And that independence of the judiciary, \nin turn, has helped to ensure the protection of our democracy, our \nfreedoms, and our liberties.\n  In ancient Rome, when the Senate lost its power, and the emperor \nbecame a tyrant, it was not because the emperor abolished the Senate. \nIn ancient Rome, when the Senate lost its power, it continued to exist, \nat least in name. But in ancient Rome, when the Senate lost its power, \nin the words of the Senate's historian, Senator Robert Byrd, the Senate \nbecame ``little more than a name.''\n  In ancient Rome, when the Senate lost its power, the Roman Senate was \ncomplicit in the transfer. The emperor did not have to seize all the \nhonors and\n\n[[Page S5505]]\n\npowers. The Roman Senate, one after another, conferred greater powers \non Caesar.\n  It was not the abolition of the Senate that made the emperor \npowerful. It was the Senate's complete deference.\n  Like the Roman Senate before us, we risk bringing our diminution upon \nourselves. We risk bringing upon ourselves a hollow Senate, a mere \nshadow of its past self. And we risk bringing upon ourselves a loss of \nthe checks and balances that ensure our American democracy.\n  This change, if it succeeds, will leave Senators, as T.S. Eliot \ndescribed in his 1925 poem, as ``The Hollow Men.'' In that poem, Eliot \nwrote of a place like what the Senate would become. He wrote:\n\n       ``Our dried voices, when\n       We whisper together\n       Are quiet and meaningless\n       As wind in dry grass\n       This is the dead land\n       This is cactus land\n       In this hollow valley\n       This broken jaw of our lost kingdoms\n       In this last of meeting places\n       We grope together\n       And avoid speech\n       Gathered on this beach of the tumid river\n       This is the way democracy ends; this is the way democracy \n     ends; this is the way democracy ends; not with a bomb, but a \n     gavel.''\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, before the distinguished \nSenator from Montana departs, I want to thank him for obviously \nsomething that has been well thought out and deeply felt. He is a \ndistinguished Senator who has served decades in the Senate and who has \nrisen to the position as chairman of the Finance Committee. He \nunderstands the traditions and the comity of this institution in order \nfor it to function. It clearly cannot function unless Senators can get \nalong and trust each other, where Senators can have respect for one \nanother, and where the minority is not run over all the time by the \nmajority.\n  That is one of the great checks and balances of this constitutional \nsystem that we have. The rights of the minority are protected because \nof extended debate which, at the end of the day, encourages compromise \nand consensus building.\n  As the Good Book says: Come, let us reason together.\n  So I thank the Senator for his comments. I thank him for being a \nmentor to me, as I have so enjoyed his company and his leadership as \nwell as the company of all these Senators. There is not a Senator here \nthat I don't like. I like them all. I want to see this body continue to \nfunction as it has for 216 years, as the greatest deliberative body in \nthe world. We are about to change that dramatically if this nuclear \noption is, in fact, employed.\n  I thank the Senator for his comments.\n  Mr. President, I want to add in my own little way a plea to the rest \nof the Senators. I have gotten into some of the discussions that are \ngoing on around this Capitol Building right now, to see if we can head \noff this thing. It doesn't look like we can. It looks like people are \nhardening into their positions. I wonder why. Is it worth changing over \ntwo centuries of history and precedent in the Senate for what, in \neffect, are five judges? Is it worth giving up the traditions and the \nprotection of the minority, under the rules, for over two centuries for \nfive judges?\n  I was surprised when I looked over the record and found out what my \nvoting record has been here. I have voted, under President Bush, for \n209 of his judicial nominees; I have voted against 7. That is 97 \npercent of the President's nominees for Federal judgeships that I have \nvoted for. Am I not entitled, as the senior Senator from Florida, to \nexercise my judgment on seven people for a lifetime appointment as \njudge, when I don't think they have the judicial temperament in order \nto be judge for life? That is what the Senate is all about. That is \nwhat the Constitution said it is all about. It says that the judicial \nprocess is a two-step process. The President nominates and the Senate \ndecides. In the old language of the constitutional forefathers it was \n``advise and consent.''\n  My advice was, on seven, that I didn't think they had the judicial \ntemperament, that they would look dispassionately at an issue, that \nthey would look at the facts and apply the law. Those seven seemed to \nme to have their minds already made up.\n  That is not what I want in a judge. I want a judge who is going to be \nfairminded, who is going to listen to all the nuances and make a fair \nand reasoned judgment.\n  I gave the President the benefit of the doubt on these 209. I can \ntell you, some of those were in Florida. On those I didn't give him the \nbenefit of the doubt; those were good because in Florida we have a \nsystem whereby we have a judicial nominating commission, which is not \nby law but has been by custom over the years, and that judicial \nnominating commission receives the applications of people who want to \nbe a Federal district judge, they interview them, and they make a \nrecommendation to the Senators and to the White House. The arrangement \nthat Senator Graham and I had with the White House, with Alberto \nGonzales, then the counsel for the White House, was that we would \ninterview all of those recommended to us--sometimes it was three, \nsometimes it was six--for the vacancy, and we would tell the White \nHouse if we had an objection.\n\n  That has worked. On the judges from Florida that are within that 209 \nthat I voted for, I can tell you they are good appointments.\n  But that was the give and take between the Senate and the White House \nin the filling of a judicial vacancy. That is not the ramming down your \nthroat a judicial nomination just because the White House wants it.\n  I have agreed with the White House 97 percent of the time. You can \ncalculate it mathematically, that is 97 percent of the time. So now \nthey want to take away the right, under the rule, to filibuster so that \nno matter who comes in, they are going to be approved if they have 50 \nvotes. It could be 50-50, because the tie would be broken with the Vice \nPresident sitting as the Presiding Officer of the Senate.\n  There is another reason that has just come to my attention why I do \nnot want the filibuster to be eliminated from this particular set of \njudges. If it is done for this, what is next? What is next? That the \nmajority leader would stand and take away the filibuster and my right \nto filibuster as a Senator? Is he going to do that on what the \nadministration is bent on doing, and that is drilling for oil and gas \noff the coast of Florida--drilling for what 18 million Floridians are \ndeathly afraid of; that the $50 billion a year tourism industry is \ngoing to be threatened because of oil lapping up onto our beaches?\n  Are they going to take away my right to stand out here and hold up \nsuch legislation, to drill off the coast of Florida, that would despoil \nour environment? Are they going to take away my right to protect our \nmilitary assets, an asset that is so valuable it is called restricted \nairspace? It is out in the Gulf of Mexico and portions of the Atlantic \nOcean off Florida, which is why we have so much training in Florida. \nThe pilots can go out there in that restricted airspace. Are they going \nto take away my right to utilize the filibuster to protect the \ninterests of Florida?\n  It is obvious that today they have started trying to drill off the \ncoast of Florida. Two weeks ago, I had a meeting with the Secretary of \nthe Interior, and I pleaded with her, as she had agreed back in 2001, \nthat she would not include within the 5-year plan that there would be \ndrilling further, other than what was the agreement back in 2001, to \nextend an additional 1.5 million acres for oil and gas leasing, and it \nstarted to intrude into the eastern Gulf of Mexico. She promised it in \nthe 5-year plan which was from 2002 to 2007. So when I met with her 2 \nweeks ago I asked her to give me that----\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I ask for an additional 5 minutes to proceed.\n  Mr. REID. It is my understanding the majority leader is on his way. I \nhave no problem with the Senator speaking and the same time would be \nextended to the majority.\n  Mr. KYL. Reserving the right to object, I was going to speak at 6 \no'clock. My understanding is the minority leader and the majority \nleader wanted to intercede with a brief colloquy or comments. In order \nfor my scheduling purposes, I would like to know what the\n\n[[Page S5506]]\n\ntiming then might be. Can the distinguished minority leader give me \nsome idea?\n  Mr. REID. The Republican leader is going to come to the floor and \ntalk about what the schedule will be the next couple of days. It should \nnot take long. I ask when he shows up that the distinguished Senator \nfrom Florida yield to the majority leader.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Of course.\n  Mr. REID. We get 5 minutes, they get 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Florida is recognized for an additional 5 minutes.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. This filibuster issue is so important to me as \nI project how it can be taken away from me as I try to protect the \ninterests of Florida.\n  I was about to point out that although the Secretary of the Interior \n2 weeks ago, when I requested in the next 5-year plan that she extend \nthe same protections of no additional drilling in the Gulf of Mexico \noff of Florida, would not give me that assurance.\n  I now see, as the result of a vote today in the House of \nRepresentatives, an amendment offered for oil and gas drilling off of \nthe State of Florida. It may have been this amendment, may have been \njust for gas drilling. That is the proverbial camel's nose under the \ntent.\n  All drilling, happily, in that amendment failed in the House of \nRepresentatives, but the Bush administration's intent is now clear \nsince the Secretary of Interior would not give me that assurance that \nshe gave me back in 2001. It is their intent to start drilling off the \ncoast of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico, which brings me back to the \nfilibuster.\n  I don't want to lose this precedent of 216 years in the Senate, to \nlose this right of a filibuster. If we do it with regard to these \njudges, then what is coming next, they will take away our right to \nstand up here for the interests of our States?\n  This is a matter of tremendous gravity. It affects all of us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President I ask unanimous consent that the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, the Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Might I inquire of the distinguished minority leader, the \nmajority leader will be here shortly?\n  Mr. REID. A few minutes ago he said he was on his way.\n  Let me say, one of the distinguished clerks, without divulging a \nperson's name, said that when Senator Frist and I talk about coming to \nthe floor, it is dog time, meaning every minute is 7 minutes, so you \nnever know.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I will go ahead and in between the sandwich \nwe will have the meat which will be the conversation between the two \nleaders, but I will proceed with my remarks.\n  Now I am told the leader is indeed on his way, so I will suspend and \nyield to the distinguished majority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). The majority leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, many Members have been inquiring about the \nschedule, but I do want to thank all Senators for their statements \ntoday, as well as yesterday. The debate time has been evenly divided. \nWe have heard from a number of people. This is our second day of debate \non the nomination of Priscilla Owen for the Fifth Circuit Court. We \nhave not had very much in the way of pauses in the debate. We have used \nfloor time well. And from both leaders, we thank everybody for their \nparticipation and cooperation. It has been a constructive debate.\n  Tomorrow, we will resume debate. We will be continuing debate \ntonight, but for people's planning purposes, tomorrow we will resume \ndebate on Priscilla Owen, and it would be my intent to ask consent for \nsome limitation of time before we vote on the Owen nomination. If we \nare unable to reach an agreement, I would then file a cloture motion \ntomorrow, on Friday.\n  On Monday, we would return to session and continue the debate on \nPriscilla Owen, much in the same vein it has been yesterday, today, and \nwill be tomorrow. I encourage, once again, our colleagues to take \nadvantage of the opportunity to speak. The reason we are spending the \ntime is to make sure all ideas and thoughts and concerns are expressed.\n  The Democratic leader and I have discussed this, and we will have a \nvote on Monday at approximately 5:30. It will be a procedural vote. I \nanticipate it will be--we will say 5:30 now. Senators should return for \ndebate on this vote. On Monday, Senators will have as much time as they \nneed to debate the pending nomination. We will file cloture tomorrow, \nand then we would have the cloture vote on Tuesday. And the timing of \nthat vote is something the Democratic leader and I have not talked \nabout but will do so and make our colleagues aware.\n  With that understanding--and that is the plan--we will have no \nfurther votes this evening. And we would have no votes tomorrow as well \nbut continue debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, very briefly, before I address the primary \nsubject of my presentation, I would like to do two things. First, I ask \nunanimous consent to have printed in the Record, after my remarks, the \nWashington Times op-ed piece by a former majority leader of the Senate, \nBob Dole, dated Thursday, May 19, 2005.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. KYL. Secondly, I would like to very briefly remind my colleagues \nof the fact that when we talk about the numbers of judges President \nBush has nominated who have been confirmed, it is important for us to \nremember that there has never been any controversy with respect to \ndistrict court judges. Almost all Presidents' district court judges are \nconfirmed. Those are recommended for nomination usually by Members of \nthe Senate, and it is rare, indeed, that we would object to each \nother's recommendations. Instead, for all Presidents there is a very \nhigh number of district court judges confirmed. And indeed, that was \nthe case with President Clinton and has been the case so far with \nPresident Bush.\n  So when talking about the numbers of judges confirmed, and wondering \nwhat the fuss is all about, our constituents might want to focus on the \nfact that what the other side usually does not talk about is the fact \nthat the judges that are not being confirmed are circuit court judges. \nThese are the judges directly below the U.S. Supreme Court. There are \nnot very many of them. They are very important. And these are the \njudges who are being filibustered by the minority.\n\n  How many? Well, in the case of President Bush, in his first term--and \nnone have been confirmed now at the beginning of his second term, so \nthis is the full story--35 of the President's 52 nominees have been \nconfirmed. That is only a confirmation rate of two-thirds or 67 \npercent. And that puts that at the lowest percentage of any President \nin our modern history. This chart says ``ever.'' And that is what we \nare talking about here, the 10 filibusters and 6 other threatened \nfilibusters last year of the President's circuit court judges who have \nbeen filibustered and, as a result, have never received an up-or-down \nvote. That is what is troubling us.\n  So I want folks to understand that instead of talking about almost \n200 judges confirmed, and only a very few rejected, what we are talking \nabout is the circuit court judges. And of those, only 35 of 52 have \nbeen confirmed. That is what this is all about. And these are the \njudges directly below the position of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  What I want to talk about today is a very simple and yet a very \nmomentous question. Does the Senate have the power to govern itself? \nDoes the Senate have the power to govern itself? Specifically, can a \nmajority of the Senate establish how we are governed? I have heard a \nlot of careless talk over the last few months and days. Some have \ncharged the Senate will soon break the rules to change the rules and \ndestroy the Senate as we know it. Some Senators claim the Senate is \nabout to abdicate all constitutional responsibility, is becoming a \nrubberstamp. Others\n\n[[Page S5507]]\n\nraise the specter of lawlessness and banana republics. Worst of all, \nSenators speak figuratively of detonating nuclear bombs and shutting \ndown the Senate's business.\n  This kind of hysteria does a tremendous disservice not only to the \nSenate but to our Nation as a whole. Not only are the claims blatantly \nfalse, but they add to the already unacceptable level of incivility in \nour political affairs. It is often said we should disagree without \nbeing disagreeable. That is a sentiment with which I wholeheartedly \nconcur. A good first step would be for my colleagues to stop making \noutrageous claims that Republicans want to destroy this institution.\n  The reality is the Senate is now engaged in a historic debate and, I \nbelieve, a historic effort to protect constitutional prerogatives and \nthe proper checks and balances between the branches of our Government.\n  Republicans seek to right a wrong that has undermined 214 years of \ntradition--wise, carefully thought out tradition. The fact that the \nSenate rules theoretically allowed the filibuster of judicial \nnominations, but were never used to that end, is an important indicator \nof what is right and why the precedent of allowing up-or-down votes is \nso well established. It is that precedent that has been attacked and \nwhich we seek to restore.\n  Fortunately, the Senate is not powerless to prevent a minority from \nrunning roughshod over its traditions. It has the power--indeed, I \nwould say the obligation--to govern itself. As I will demonstrate \ntoday, that power to govern itself easily extends to the device that \nhas come to be known as the constitutional option.\n  The Constitution is clear about the scope of the Senate's power to \ngovern itself. Article I, section 5, clause 2 of the Constitution \nstates that each House may determine the rules of its proceedings.\n  The Supreme Court of the United States has rarely interpreted this \nclause, but one case is important for our purposes, the case of the \nUnited States v. Ballin, a case decided in 1892. That case dealt with \nthe power of the majority of the House of Representatives to make \nrules, and it contains two holdings that bear on our situation today.\n  First, the Supreme Court held that the powers delegated to the House \nor the Senate through article I, section 5, clause 2 are powers held by \na simple majority of the quorum. The Constitution states that a \nmajority of Members constitutes a quorum, and the Supreme Court, \ntherefore, held that ``when a majority are present the house is in a \nposition to do business.''\n  The Supreme Court continued:\n\n       All that the Constitution requires is the presence of a \n     majority.\n\n  Thus, a majority is all the Constitution requires for us to make \nrules, to set precedents, and to operate on a day-to-day basis. The \nSupreme Court made this clear.\n  Second, the Supreme Court held that the power to make rules is not \none which, once exercised, is exhausted. It is a continuous power, \nalways subject to being exercised by the House. By ``House,'' the court \nmeans the House of Representatives or the Senate. The import of this \nstatement is crucial for present purposes. The power of the majority of \nSenators to define Senate procedures is one that exists at all times, \nwhether at the beginning, the middle, or the end of Congress.\n  The constitutional background is simple and uncomplicated. We can \ngovern ourselves. We can do it by majority vote, and we can do it at \nany time. Let me repeat: The Supreme Court has held that we have the \nright to govern ourselves, that we can do it by majority vote, and we \ncan do it any time.\n  Let's look at how the Senate employs its constitutional power to \ngovern itself. There are four basic ways that the Senate does so: In \nstanding rules, precedents, standing orders, and in rulemaking \nstatutes. I will discuss each briefly in turn.\n  First, the Senate has adopted standing rules to govern some but not \nall Senate practices and procedures. I have seen much confusion in the \npress and even, sadly, in this body about those standing rules. Some \nargue that the standing rules are the be-all and end-all of Senate \npractice and procedure. The confusion might be understandable outside \nthe Senate, but Senators know that these rules are but one aspect of \nthe overall set of tools, the broader rules that the Senate uses to \ngovern itself.\n  That brings us to the second way the Senate exercises its \nconstitutional power: the creation of precedents. Precedents are \ncreated whenever the Presiding Officer rules on a point of order, when \nthe Senate sustains and/or rejects an appeal of the Presiding Officer's \nruling on a point of order, or when the Senate itself rules on a \nquestion that has been submitted to it by the Presiding Officer.\n  As former Parliamentarian and Senate procedural expert Floyd Riddick \nhas said:\n\n       The precedents of the Senate are just as significant as the \n     rules of the Senate.\n\n  Let me repeat what Mr. Riddick said:\n\n       The precedents of the Senate are just as significant as the \n     rules of the Senate.\n\n  Indeed, as we will see, precedents have sometimes been created that \ndirectly contradict the Standing Rules of the Senate. I will return to \nthat point later, but I want everyone to remember what Mr. Riddick \nsaid.\n  A third way that the Senate exercises its constitutional power is \nthrough standing orders which can be adopted by legislation, Senate \nresolutions, or run-of-the-mill unanimous consent agreements. It is \nworth pausing to note that the Senate regularly overrides the standing \nrules and precedents of the Senate through unanimous consent \nagreements. You saw that a few minutes ago. Our leaders get together \nand decide, for example, to change the time to hold a cloture vote, \neven though rule XXII mandates that the vote shall occur 1 hour after \nthe Senate comes into session on the second day after the cloture \npetition is filed. Yet the leaders move the votes in direct \ncontradiction of the rules.\n  Of course, a unanimous consent agreement is formalistically \nunanimous. But that temporary rule change, if you want to call it that, \nis done completely outside the standing rules.\n  How can we do this? How can the Senate ignore the Standing Rules of \nthe Senate? The answer is simple. It goes to the essence of the \nsituation before us today. As the Supreme Court held, the Constitution \ngives the Senate the power to make rules and govern itself on a \ncontinuous basis. We are not held hostage to the standing rules, nor \nare we required to go through the cumbersome process of amending the \nstanding rules when it is necessary to get something done. This has \nalways been true.\n\n  A fourth way that the Senate exercises its constitutional power is \nthrough rulemaking statutes. For example, for 30 years the Budget Act \nhas been placing severe restrictions on the rights of Senators to \ndebate. Indeed, the Congressional Research Service has identified 26 \nrulemaking statutes that somehow limit the ability of individual \nSenators to debate and/or amend legislation. Think about that for a \nmoment. We hear much pontificating on this floor about the supposedly \nsacred and untouchable right of Senators to debate on an unlimited \nbasis. Yet, arguably, our most important function, that of ensuring \nthat government services are budgeted and receive funding, is subject \nto carefully crafted restrictions of that right of debate. We have 50 \nhours of debate, followed by a majority vote, period. For generations, \nSenators have judged some limits on debate are necessary just as a \nmatter of common sense. This is one of them.\n  Parenthetically, no matter how many times a few Senators say \notherwise, this controversy before us now has nothing whatsoever to do \nwith free speech, as the minority leader himself has acknowledged. This \ndispute has never been about the length of debate. It is about blocking \njudicial nominees. We will have plenty of debate on all of the \nnominees, as much as anyone wants.\n  I would like to move to another important aspect of this discussion: \nThe role of tradition and norms of conduct in the day-to-day \nfunctioning of the Senate. This is crucial. Although it is frequently \nsaid that the unique features of the Senate are individual Senator's \nrights to demand and amend, there is another even more central aspect \nto Senate procedure. As I see it, the overriding feature of the Senate \nis the mutual self-restraint and respect for the settled norms of this \nbody. I would like to consider a few examples.\n  Senators limit their speech on an informal basis every day. We cut \nshort\n\n[[Page S5508]]\n\nremarks so that others can speak. We did that a few moments ago. We \nacquiesce in unanimous consent agreements that will have the effect of \ndenying ourselves any chance to speak on a subject. We decline to \nobject to procedural unanimous consent requests even though we might \nhave good reason to want to slow down Senate business. We acquiesce in \nour leader's floor schedule. We work with bill managers to limit \namendments so that the Senate can function, so that each individual \nSenator's rights do not become an impediment to the task of governing. \nSenators have rights, but we also have obligations to each other and to \nthe Nation.\n  So we limit our rights on the basis of mutual respect and a belief in \ngood government but, candidly, also out of fear of retaliation. If I \nassert my rights too forcefully, I not only disrespect my colleagues, \nbut I threaten my own public policy goals. The result is a complicated \nmutual truce of sorts that allows us to do the people's business in an \norderly way. In a word, we gain institutional stability.\n  In short, the Senate is institutionally stable, not just because of \nrules, precedents, or the standing order, or the rulemaking statutes I \ndiscussed. The body is stable because we respect each other's \nprerogatives. We understand that any breach of the truce will produce a \nreaction. And it is that basic understanding of physics, action, and \nreaction, coupled with a genuine goodwill that allows us to function \neven with the many individual rights that we possess. The rights only \nwork because we so often choose not to exercise them. So it is not just \nrights that define the Senate but also restraint.\n  Which brings us back to the filibuster of judicial nominations. It is \ncertainly the case that the Standing Rules of the Senate do countenance \nthe filibuster of judicial nominations, but it is equally the case that \nthe longstanding norms of the Senate do not. Until 2003, no judicial \nnominee with demonstrable support of a majority of Senators had ever \nbeen denied an up-or-down vote on the Senate floor through a \nfilibuster. Even on the rare occasions where there were attempts, they \nfailed on a bipartisan basis. And why? Because the filibuster of \njudicial nominations used as a minority veto was not part of our \ntradition and never had been. Again, out of respect for fellow Members, \nfor the President, and for the judiciary, and out of a recognition of \nthe long-term impact of such tactics, the Senate had always declined to \nmarch down this path.\n  When I entered the Senate in 1995, I had grave concerns about some of \nmore activist nominees that President Clinton sent to us.\n  But I listened to Chairman Orrin Hatch, Majority Leader Trent Lott, \nand many others. They taught that we had a longstanding Senate \ntradition against blocking Senate nominations by filibuster. So I \njoined Democrats and Republicans alike in making sure there were no \nfilibusters.\n  Ironically, some point to those successful cloture votes for \nconfirmed judges and claim those nominees were filibustered. Well, all \nthat establishes is that both parties ensured a supermajority to end \ndebate, precisely to adhere to historical norms. We took the steps to \nensure those judicial nominees who reach the Senate floor received the \nfair up-or-down votes to which they were entitled. Again, the standing \nrules might have permitted such obstruction, but the Senate norms and \ntraditions did not.\n  To the extent the rules technically permitted such obstruction, the \ntraditions had rendered the power obsolete and inert. In common law, \nthere is a doctrine called desuetude, which means that obsolete or \nunenforced laws shall not have effect in the future even if not \nformally repealed. In other words, a law that is de facto unenforced \nmay be treated as ineffective de jure as well.\n  We faced a similar situation in the Senate. In fact, our tradition \nwas our rule. To minimize the traditions of this body is to display a \nnaive and legalistic misunderstanding of the institution. To say we are \na body of traditions is meaningless if we do not acknowledge that our \ntraditions have content and meaning. There can be no question that the \nfilibusters of the last Congress broke that Senate tradition and, \ntherefore, the set way this body had governed itself. By breaking \ntraditions of the Senate, members of the minority should have known \nthey would force the Senate to react. Tradition should never change \nwithout consensus, and a consensus requires, at a minimum, a majority. \nThe question is, what are we to do when norms and traditions are \nchanged by the minority? What do we do when there is no consensus, just \na minority with a determination to exploit dormant rules to further \npartisan end? The Senate can do one of two things: Let our traditions \nbe transformed and permit rule by minority or we can insist that the \nSenate maintain traditional norms and take action to protect them.\n  That brings us to the constitutional option itself. The \nconstitutional option is nothing more than the Senate governing itself, \nas the Constitution provides, by acts of majorities of Senators. The \nSenate has been in this situation before 4 times over a 10-year period, \nwhen the Senate majority reacted to a minority using rules that had not \ntraditionally been used to obstruct Senate business. My colleague \nSenator McConnell will discuss each instance in depth. I address one in \nparticular by way of illustration.\n  In 1977, two Senators attempted to block a natural gas deregulation \nbill after cloture had already been invoked. They were succeeding \nthrough a strategy of ``filibuster by amendment.'' Post-cloture debate \ntime had lapsed, but the obstructing Senators could still call up \namendments, force quorum calls, and force rollcall votes on the \namendments. Rule XXII prohibited dilatory or nongermane amendments, but \nSenate procedure did not rule these amendments out of order. True, a \nSenator could raise a point of order against one of these dilatory \namendments, but any favorable ruling could be appealed. A rollcall vote \ncould then be demanded on that appeal. And once that rollcall vote \nbegan, the obstructing Senators could accomplish their slowdown in a \ndifferent way--filibuster by rollcall vote. To make matters worse, in \n1977, before any point of order could even be made against an \namendment, the amendment in question had to be read by the clerk. By \nobjecting to the routine courtesy of waiving the reading of the \namendment, the obstructing Senators delayed the business of the Senate \neven further.\n  That all may seem complicated, but there is one undeniable truth \nabout what these obstructing Senators were doing. It was all completely \npermitted under the standing rules and the precedents of the Senate. At \nthe same time, however, these tactics were in violation of settled \nSenate norms and practices. So what was the Senate to do?\n  The answer came when the then-Democratic majority leader made the \ndecision these new tactics were dilatory, in violation of the \ntraditional norms, and could no longer prevail. He asked then-Vice \nPresident Walter Mondale to sit in the chair in his capacity as \nPresident of the Senate. The Democratic majority leader made a point of \norder that ``when the Senate is operating under cloture, the chair is \nrequired to take the initiative under Rule XXII to rule out of order \nall amendments that are dilatory or which on their face are out of \norder.'' Mondale sustained the point of order, even though it had no \nfoundation in the rules or precedents of the Senate. Another Senator \nappealed the Mondale ruling, and the Democratic majority leader moved \nto table. The Senate then voted to table the appeal. In doing so, the \nSenate created a new precedent. But that precedent ran directly \ncontrary to the Senate's longstanding procedures which had required \nSenators to raise points of order to enforce Senate rules. Under the \nnew precedent established by the Senate, no such point of order would \nbe necessary.\n\n  Again, this may seem complicated, but these small changes had \ndramatic effects. The Democratic majority leader began to call up each \nof the dilatory amendments so the Chair could rule them out of order. \nOne by one, the Chair obliged. Under normal circumstances, an appeal \nwould have been in order, but the majority leader exercised his right \nof preferential recognition to block any appeal. He quickly called up \nevery remaining amendment, Vice President Mondale ruled them out of \norder, and all of the amendments were disposed of.\n  Nearly 20 years later, the Senator who orchestrated those events in \n1977\n\n[[Page S5509]]\n\nexplained to the Senate what he had done. He explained:\n\n       I asked Mr. Mondale, the Vice President, to go please sit \n     in the chair; I wanted to make some points of order and \n     create new precedents that would break these filibusters. And \n     the filibuster was broken--back, neck, legs, and arms. So \n     there should be no confusion about what happened on that day.\n\n  That was the constitutional option in action. The Senate faced a \nsituation where a minority of Senators was frustrating Senate business \nin an untraditional way. The majority wished to proceed. The majority \ndid not propose any formal rules change, refer the proposal to the \nRules Committee, wait for its action, and then bring it to the floor \nunder rule XXII's cloture provisions for such rule change proposals. \nThat procedure was not followed. Instead, the majority leader \nrecognized that the Senate had the constitutional power to bypass that \nroute, which is exactly what the Senate did.\n  As I mentioned earlier, that same Democratic leader would create \nseveral other precedents while serving as majority leader, in each case \nbecause he concluded the existing standing rules and precedents of the \nSenate were inadequate, and that a majority of Senators had the power \nto alter the way the Senate governs itself. In 1979, for example, a new \nprecedent was created to prevent legislation on appropriations bills, \nin direct contravention of the text of the standing rules at that time. \nIn 1980, the Senate used the constitutional option to eliminate the \nability to debate and filibuster the motion to proceed to a particular \nitem on the Executive Calendar. That situation is remarkably similar to \nthe one we face today. In 1987, in a complicated set of maneuvers, the \nSenate created new precedents to limit minority rights and declare that \ncertain dilatory tactics during the morning hour were out of order.\n  I will not examine each of these historical events in detail today. \nInstead, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy \nof the policy paper prepared by the Republican Policy Committee, which \nI chair, which examined each of these events in great detail.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered To be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      The Senate's Power To Make Procedural Rules by Majority Vote\n\n\n                              Introduction\n\n       In recent months, there has been growing public interest in \n     the Senate's ability to change its internal procedures by \n     majority vote. The impetus for this discussion is a Senate \n     minority's use of the filibuster to block votes on 10 \n     judicial nominations during the 108th Congress. Until then, a \n     bipartisan majority of Senators had worked together to \n     guarantee that filibusters were not to be used to permanently \n     block up-or-down votes on judicial nominations. For example, \n     as recently as March 2000, Majority Leader Trent Lott and \n     Minority Leader Tom Daschle worked together to ensure that \n     judicial nominees Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon received up-\n     or-down votes, even though Majority Leader Lott and most of \n     the Republican caucus ultimately voted against those \n     nominations. But that shared understanding of Senate norms \n     and practices--that judicial nominations shall not be blocked \n     by filibuster--broke down in the 108th Congress.\n       This breakdown in Senate norms is profound. There is now a \n     risk that the Senate is creating a new, 60-vote confirmation \n     standard. The Constitution plainly requires no more than a \n     majority vote to confirm any executive nomination, but some \n     Senators have shown that they are determined to override this \n     constitutional standard. Thus, if the Senate does not act \n     during the 109th Congress to restore the Constitution's \n     simple-majority standard, it could be plausibly argued that a \n     precedent has been set by the Senate's acquiescence in a 60-\n     vote threshold for nominations.\n       One way that Senators can restore the Senate's traditional \n     understanding of its advice and consent responsibility is to \n     employ the ``constitutional option''--an exercise of a Senate \n     majority's power under the Constitution to define Senate \n     practices and procedures. The constitutional option can be \n     exercised in different ways, such as amending Senate Standing \n     Rules or by creating precedents, but regardless of the \n     variant, the purpose would be the same--to restore previous \n     Senate practices in the face of unforeseen abuses. Exercising \n     the constitutional option in response to judicial nomination \n     filibusters would restore the Senate to its longstanding \n     norms and practices governing judicial nominations, and \n     guarantee that a minority does not transform the fundamental \n     nature of the Senate's advice and consent responsibility. The \n     approach, therefore, would be both reactive and restorative.\n       This constitutional option is well grounded in the U.S. \n     Constitution and in Senate history. The Senate has always \n     had, and repeatedly has exercised, the constitutional power \n     to change the Senate's procedures through a majority vote. \n     Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd used the constitutional option \n     in 1977, 1979, 1980, and 1987 to establish precedents \n     changing Senate procedures during the middle of a Congress. \n     And the Senate several times has changed its Standing Rules \n     after the constitutional option had been threatened, \n     beginning with the adoption of the first cloture rule in \n     1917. Simply put, the constitutional option itself is a \n     longstanding feature of Senate practice.\n       This paper proceeds in four parts: (1) a discussion of the \n     constitutional basis of the Senate's right to set rules for \n     its proceedings; (2) an examination of past instances when \n     Senate majorities acted to define Senate practices--even \n     where the written rules and binding precedents of the Senate \n     dictated otherwise; (3) an evaluation of how this history \n     relates to the present impasse regarding judicial nomination \n     filibusters; and (4) a clarification of common \n     misunderstandings of the constitutional option. The purpose \n     of this paper is not to resolve the political question of \n     whether the Senate should exercise the constitutional option, \n     but merely to demonstrate the constitutional and historical \n     legitimacy of such an approach.\n\n\n      The Constitution: the Senate's Right to Set Procedural Rules\n\n       The Senate's constitutional power to make rules is \n     straightforward, but two issues do warrant brief \n     elaboration--the number of Senators that are constitutionally \n     necessary to establish procedures and whether there are any \n     time limitations as to when the rulemaking power can be \n     exercised.\n       The Supreme Court addressed both of these questions in \n     United States v. Ballin, an 1892 case interpreting Congress's \n     rulemaking powers. [144 U.S. 1 (1892).] First, the Court held \n     that the powers delegated to each body are held by a simple \n     majority of the quorum, unless the Constitution expressly \n     creates a supermajority requirement. [Ballin, 144 U.S. at 6. \n     There is no serious disagreement with the Supreme Court's \n     conclusion in Ballin. Indeed, Senator Edward Kennedy has said \n     that only a majority is necessary to change Senate \n     procedures. Congressional Record, Feb. 20, 1975, S3848. \n     Senator Charles Schumer conceded during a Judiciary \n     subcommittee hearing on the constitutionality of the \n     filibuster that Senate rules ``could be changed by a majority \n     vote.'' S. Hrg. 108-227 (May 6, 2003), at 60.] The \n     Constitution itself sets the quorum for doing business--a \n     majority of the Senate. [U.S. Const., art. I, 5, cl. 1.] \n     Second, the Supreme Court held that the ``power to make rules \n     is not one which once exercised is exhausted. It is a \n     continuous power, always subject to be exercised by the \n     house.'' [Ballin, 144 U.S. at 5.] Thus, the Supreme Court has \n     held that the power of a majority of Senators to define the \n     Senate's procedures exists at all times whether at the \n     beginning, middle, or end of a Congress.\n       The Senate majority exercises this constitutional \n     rulemaking power in several ways:\n       First, it has adopted Standing Rules to govern some Senate \n     practices and procedures. Those rules formally can be changed \n     by a majority vote. Any motion to formally amend the Standing \n     Rules is subject to debate, and Senate Rule XXII creates a \n     special two-thirds cloture threshold to end that debate.\n       Second, the Senate operates according to Senate precedents, \n     i.e., rulings by the Chair or the Senate itself regarding \n     questions of Senate procedure. A precedent is created \n     whenever the Chair rules on a point of order, when the Senate \n     sustains or rejects an appeal of the Chair's ruling on a \n     point of order, or when the Senate itself rules on a question \n     that has been submitted to it by the Chair. [Floyd M. \n     Riddick, Senate Parliamentarian, Oral History Interviews \n     (November 21, 1978), Senate Historical Office, Washington, \n     D.C., at 429.] As former parliamentarian and Senate \n     procedural expert Floyd M. Riddick has said, ``The \n     precedents of the Senate are just as significant as the \n     rules of the Senate.'' [Riddick interview at 426.]\n       Third, the Senate binds itself through rule-making statutes \n     that constrain and channel the consideration of particular \n     matters and guarantee that the Senate can take action on \n     certain matters by majority vote. At least 26 such rule-\n     making statutes govern Senate procedure and limit the right \n     to debate, dating back to the 1939 Reorganization Act and \n     including, most prominently, the 1974 Budget Act.

For a \n     complete list of the 26 statutes that limit Senate debate, \n     see John Cornyn, Our Broken Judicial Confirmation Process and \n     the Need for Filibuster Reform, 27 Harv. J. L. Pub. Pol'y \n     181,213-214 (2003).]\n       Finally, the Senate can modify the above procedures through \n     Standing Orders, which can be entered via formal legislation, \n     Senate resolutions, and unanimous consent agreements.\n       It is important to emphasize, however, that these rules are \n     the mere background for day-today Senate procedure. As any \n     Senate observer knows, the institution functions primarily \n     through cooperation and tacit or express agreements about \n     appropriate behavior. Most business is conducted by unanimous \n     consent, and collective norms have emerged that assist in the \n     protection of minority rights without unduly hindering the \n     Senate's business.\n\n[[Page S5510]]\n\n       Consider, for example, the Senate's contrasting norms \n     regarding the exercise of individual Senators' procedural \n     rights. Under the rules and precedents of the Senate, each \n     Senator has the right to object to consent requests and, with \n     a sufficient second, to demand roll call votes on customarily \n     routine motions. If Senators routinely exercised those \n     rights, however, the Senate would come to a standstill. Such \n     wholesale obstruction is rare, but not because the Senate's \n     standing rules, precedents, and rulemaking statutes prohibit \n     a Senator from engaging in that kind of delay. Rather, \n     Senators rarely employ such dilatory tactics because of the \n     potential reaction of other Senators or the possibility of \n     retaliation. As a result, informed self enforcement of \n     reasonable behavior is the norm.\n       At the same time, some ``obstructionist'' tactics have long \n     been accepted by the Senate as features of a body that \n     respects minority rights. Most prominent is the broadly \n     accepted right of a single Senator to speak for as long as he \n     or she wants on pending legislation, subject only to the \n     right of the majority to invoke cloture and shut off debate. \n     Indeed, an overwhelming and bipartisan consensus in support \n     of the current legislative filibuster system has existed for \n     30 years. [Standing Rule XXII's standard for cloture--three-\n     fifths of Senators ``duly chosen and sworn''--has been in \n     effect since 1975.] Thus, the norms of the Senate tolerate \n     some, but not all, kinds or degrees of obstruction.\n       Thus, while written rules, precedents, and orders are \n     important, common understandings of self-restraint, \n     discretion, and institutional propriety have primarily \n     governed acceptable Senatorial conduct. It is the departures \n     from these norms of conduct that have precipitated \n     institutional crises that require the Senate to respond.\n\n\n  The History: the Senate's Repeated Use of the Constitutional Option\n\n       The Senate is a relatively stable institution, but its \n     norms of conduct have sometimes been violated. In some \n     instances, a minority of Senators has rejected past practices \n     and bipartisan understandings and exploited heretofore ``off \n     limits'' opportunities to obstruct the Senate's business. At \n     other times, a minority of Senators has abused the rules and \n     precedents in a manner that violates Senators' reasonable \n     expectations of proper procedural parameters. These are \n     efforts to change Senate norms and practices, but they do not \n     necessarily have the support of a majority.\n       Such situations create institutional conundrums: what \n     should be done when a mere minority of Senators changes \n     accepted institutional norms? One option is to acquiesce and \n     allow ``rule by the minority'' so that the minority's norm \n     becomes the Senate's new norm. But another option has been \n     for the majority of Senators to deny the legitimacy of the \n     minority Senators' effort to shift the norms of the entire \n     body. And to do that, it has been necessary for the majority \n     to act independently to restore the previous Senate norms of \n     conduct.\n       This section examines those illustrative instances--\n     examples of when the Senate refused to permit a minority of \n     Senators to change norms of conduct or to otherwise exploit \n     the rules in ways destructive to the Senate, and, instead, \n     exercised the constitutional option.\n       When Senator Robert C. Byrd was Majority Leader, he faced \n     several circumstances in which a minority of Senators (from \n     both parties) began to exploit Senate rules and precedents in \n     generally unprecedented ways. The result was obstruction of \n     Senate business that was wholly unrelated to the \n     institution's great respect for the right to debate and \n     amend. Majority Leader Byrd's response was to implement \n     procedural changes through majoritarian votes in order to \n     restore Senate practices to the previously accepted norms of \n     the body.\n       In 1977, two Senators attempted to block a natural gas \n     deregulation bill after cloture had already been invoked. \n     [See Martin B. Gold & Dimple Gupta, The Constitutional Option \n     to Change Senate Rules and Procedures: a Majoritarian Means \n     to Overcome the Filibuster, 28 Harv. J. L. Pub. Pol'y \n     206,262-264 (2004).] A ``post-cloture filibuster'' should \n     seem counterintuitive for anyone with a casual acquaintance \n     with Senate rules, but these obstructing Senators had found a \n     loophole. Although further debate was foreclosed by Rule XXII \n     once post-cloture debate was exhausted, the Senators were \n     able to delay a final vote by offering a series of amendments \n     and then forcing quorum calls and roll call votes for each \n     one. Even if the amendments were ``dilatory'' or ``not \n     germane'' (which Rule XXII expressly prohibits), Senate \n     procedure provided no mechanism to get an automatic ruling \n     from the Chair that the amendments were defective. A Senator \n     could raise a point of order, but any favorable ruling could \n     be appealed, and a roll call vote could be demanded on the \n     appeal. Moreover, in 1975, before a point of order could even \n     be made, an amendment first must have been read by the clerk. \n     While the reading of amendments is commonly waived by \n     unanimous consent, anyone could object and require a reading \n     that could further tie up Senate business. Thus, the finality \n     that cloture is supposed to produce could be frustrated.\n       These practices were proper under Senate rules and \n     precedents, but Majority Leader Byrd concluded in this \n     context that these tactics were an abuse of Senate Rule XXII. \n     His response was to make a point of order that ``when the \n     Senate is operating under cloture the Chair is required to \n     take the initiative under rule XXII to rule out of order all \n     amendments which are dilatory or which on their face are out \n     of order.'' [Gold & Gupta, 28 Harv. J. L. Pub. Pol'y at 263.] \n     The Presiding Officer, Vice President Walter Mondale, \n     sustained the point of order, another Senator appealed, and \n     Majority Leader Byrd immediately moved to table. The Senate \n     then voted to sustain the motion to table the appeal. In so \n     doing, the Senate set a new precedent that ran directly \n     contrary to the Senate's longstanding procedures which \n     required Senators to raise points of order to enforce Senate \n     rules. Now, under this precedent, the Chair would be \n     empowered to take the initiative to rule on questions of \n     order in a post-cloture environment.\n       The reason for Majority Leader Byrd's tactic immediately \n     became clear. He began to call up each of the dilatory \n     amendments that had been filed post-cloture, and the Chair \n     instantly ruled them out of order. There was no reading of \n     the amendments (which would have been dilatory in itself) and \n     there were no roll call votes. The Majority Leader then \n     exercised his right of preferential recognition to call up \n     numerous remaining amendments, and similarly disposed of \n     them. No appeals could be taken because any appeal was mooted \n     when Majority Leader Byrd secured his preferential \n     recognition to call up additional amendments. [Gold & Gupta, \n     28 Harv. J. L. Pub. Pol'y at 263-264.]\n       This was the constitutional option in action. Majority \n     Leader Byrd did not follow the regular order and attempt to \n     amend the Senate Rules in order to block these tactics. \n     Instead, he used a simple point of order that cut off the \n     ability of a minority of Senators to add a new layer of \n     obstruction to the legislative process. His method was \n     consistent with the Senate's constitutional authority to \n     establish procedure.\n       Majority Leader Byrd used the constitutional option again \n     in 1979 in order to block legislation on appropriations \n     bills. [Gold & Gupta, 28 Harv. J. L. Pub. Pol'y at 264-265.] \n     Standing Rule XVI barred Senate legislative amendments to \n     appropriations bills. By precedent, however, such amendments \n     were permissible when offered as germane modifications of \n     House legislative provisions. Thus, when the House acted \n     first and added legislative language to an appropriations \n     measure, Senators could respond by offering legislative \n     amendments to the House's legislative language. While another \n     Senator might make a point of order, the Senator offering the \n     authorizing language could respond with a defense of \n     germaneness. And, by the express language of Rule XVI, that \n     question of germaneness must be submitted to the Senate and \n     decided without debate. By enabling the full Senate to vote \n     on the germaneness defense without getting a ruling from the \n     Presiding Officer first, the legislative amendment's sponsor \n     avoided having to overturn the ruling of the Chair and create \n     any formal precedents in doing so. The result was a breakdown \n     in the appropriations process due to legislative amendments, \n     and it was happening pursuant to Senate rules that plainly \n     permitted these tactics.\n       Majority Leader Byrd resolved to override the plain text of \n     Rule XVI and strip the Senate of its ability to decide \n     questions of germaneness in this context. Senator Byrd's \n     mechanism was similar to the motion he employed in 1977: he \n     made a point of order that ``this is a misuse of precedents \n     of the Senate, since there is no House language to which this \n     amendment could be germane, and that, therefore, the Chair is \n     required to rule on the point of order as to its being \n     legislation on an appropriation bill and cannot submit the \n     question of germaneness to the Senate.'' [Gold & Gupta, 28 \n     Harv. J. L. Pub. Pol'y at 265 (emphasis added).] The Chair \n     sustained the point of order, and the Senate rejected the \n     ensuing appeal, 44-40.\n       The result of Majority Leader Byrd's exercise of the \n     constitutional option was a binding precedent that caused the \n     Senate to operate in a manner directly contrary to the plain \n     language of Rule XVI. [Gold & Gupta, 28 Harv. J. L. Pub. \n     Pol'y at 265.] Moreover, the method was contrary to past \n     Senate practices regarding germaneness. But the process \n     employed, as in 1977, was nonetheless constitutional because \n     nothing in the Senate's rules, precedents, or practices can \n     deny the Senate the constitutional power to set its \n     procedural rules.\n       The Senate's Executive Calendar has two sections--treaties \n     and nominations. Prior to March 1980, a motion to enter \n     Executive Session, if carried, would move the Senate \n     automatically to the first item on the Calendar, often a \n     treaty. Rule XXII provides (then and now) that such a motion \n     to enter Executive Session is not debatable. However, unlike \n     the non-debatable motion to enter Executive Session, any \n     motion to proceed to a particular item on the Executive \n     Calendar was then subject to debate. In practice, then, the \n     Senate could not proceed to consider any business other than \n     the first Executive Calendar item without a Senator offering \n     a debatable motion, which then would be subject to a possible \n     filibuster. [Gold & Gupta, 28 Harv. J. L. Pub. Pol'y at 265-\n     267.]\n       Majority Leader Byrd announced his objection to this \n     potential ``double filibuster'' (once on the motion to \n     proceed to a particular Executive Calendar item, and again on \n     the Executive Calendar item itself), and exercised another \n     version of the constitutional option. This time he moved to \n     proceed directly to a particular nomination on the Executive \n     Calendar and sought to do so without debate. Senator Jesse \n     Helms made the\n\n[[Page S5511]]\n\n     point of order that Majority Leader Byrd could only move by a \n     non-debatable motion into Executive Session, not to a \n     particular treaty or nomination. [Gold & Gupta, 28 Harv. J. \n     L. Pub. Pol'y at 266.] The Presiding Officer upheld the point \n     of order given that it was grounded in Rule XXII and \n     longstanding understandings of Senate practices and \n     procedures. But Majority Leader Byrd simply appealed the \n     ruling of the Chair and prevailed, 38-54. Thus, even though \n     there was no basis in the Senate Rules, and even though \n     Senate practices had long preserved the right to debate any \n     motion to proceed to a particular Executive Calendar item, \n     the Senate exercised its constitutional power to ``make rules \n     for its proceedings'' and created the procedure that the \n     Senate continues to use today.\n       As an historical sidenote, Majority Leader Byrd used this \n     new precedent to great effect in December 1980 when he \n     bypassed several items (including several nominations) on the \n     Executive Calendar to take up a single judicial nomination--\n     that of Stephen Breyer, then Chief Counsel to the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee, to be a judge on the U.S. Court of \n     Appeals for the First Circuit. Judge Breyer was later \n     nominated and confirmed to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1994. \n     Without Majority Leader Byrd's exercise of the constitutional \n     option earlier that year, it is almost certain that Justice \n     Breyer would not be on the Supreme Court today.\n       A fourth exercise of the constitutional option came in 1987 \n     when Senator Byrd was once again Majority Leader. The \n     controversy in question involved an effort by Majority Leader \n     Byrd to proceed to consider a particular bill, an effort that \n     had been frustrated because a minority of Senators objected \n     each time he moved to proceed. To thwart his opponents, \n     Majority Leader Byrd sought to use a special feature of the \n     Senate Rules--the Morning Hour (the first two hours of the \n     Legislative Day).\n       Under Rule VIII, a motion to proceed to an item on the \n     Legislative Calendar that is made during the Morning Hour is \n     non-debatable. This feature of the rules gives the Majority \n     Leader significant power to set the Senate agenda due to his \n     right to preferential recognition (which is, itself, a \n     creature of mere custom and precedent). Such a motion cannot \n     be made, however, until the Senate Journal is approved and \n     Morning Business is thereafter concluded (or the first of the \n     two hours has passed). Meanwhile, the clock runs on the \n     Morning Hour while that preliminary business takes place. \n     When the Morning Hour expires, a motion to proceed once again \n     becomes debatable and subject to filibuster. [Gold, Senate \n     Procedure and Practice, at 68-69.] It was this feature of the \n     Morning Hour that Senator Byrd believed would enable him to \n     proceed to the bill in question.\n       Majority Leader Byrd's plan was complicated, however, when \n     objecting Senators forced a roll call vote on the approval of \n     the Journal, as was their right under the procedures and \n     practices of the Senate. Rule XII provides that during a roll \n     call vote, if a Senator declines to vote, he or she must \n     state a reason for being excused. The Presiding Officer then \n     must put a non-debatable question to the Senate as to whether \n     the Senator should be excused from voting. When Majority \n     Leader Byrd moved to approve the Journal, one Senator \n     declined to vote and sought to be excused. Following Rule \n     XII, the Presiding Officer put the question directly to the \n     Senate--should the Senator be excused?--but during the roll \n     call on whether the first Senator should be excused, another \n     Senator announced that he wished to be excused from voting on \n     whether the first Senator should be excused. The Chair was \n     likewise obliged to put the question to the Senate. At that \n     point, yet another Senator announced he wished to be excused \n     from that vote. There were four roll call votes then \n     underway--the original motion to approve the Journal and \n     three votes on whether Senators could be excused. If Senators \n     persisted in this tactic, the time it took for roll call \n     votes would cause the Morning Hour to expire, and the \n     Majority Leader would lose his ability to move to proceed to \n     his bill without debate. All this maneuvering was wholly \n     consistent with the Standing Rules of the Senate.\n       Majority Leader Byrd countered with a point of order, \n     arguing that the requests to be excused were, in fact, little \n     more than efforts to delay the actual vote on the approval of \n     the Journal. His solution was to exercise the constitutional \n     option: to use majority-supported Senate precedents to change \n     Senate procedures, outside the operation of the Senate rules. \n     In three subsequent partyline votes, three new precedents \n     were established: first, that a point of order could be made \n     declaring repeated requests to be excused from voting on a \n     motion to approve the Journal (or a vote subsumed by it) to \n     be ``dilatory;'' second, that repeated requests to be excused \n     from voting on a motion to approve the Journal (or a vote \n     subsumed by it) ``when they are obviously done for the \n     purpose of delaying the announcement of the vote on the \n     motion to approve the Journal, are out of order;'' and third, \n     that a Senator has a ``limited time'' to explain his reason \n     for not voting, i.e., he cannot filibuster by speaking \n     indefinitely when recognized to state his reason for not \n     voting. [Gold & Gupta, 28 Harv. J. L. Pub. Pol'y at 267-269.] \n     Majority Leader Byrd had crafted these new procedures \n     completely independently of the Senate Rules, and they were \n     adopted by a partisan majority without following the \n     procedures for rule changes provided in Rule XXII. Yet the \n     tactics were wholly within the Senate's constitutional power \n     to devise its own procedures.\n       This 1987 circumstance offers a very important precedent \n     for the present difficulties. Majority Leader Byrd \n     established that a majority could restrict the rights of \n     individual Senators outside the cloture process if the \n     majority concluded that the Senators were acting in a purely \n     ``dilatory'' fashion. Previous to that day, dilatory tactics \n     were only out of order after cloture had been invoked.\n       The Senate also has endorsed (or acted in response to) some \n     version of the constitutional option several other times over \n     the past 90 years--in 1917, 1959, 1975, and 1979.\n       The original cloture rule, adopted in 1917, itself appears \n     to be the result of a threat to exercise the constitutional \n     option. Until 1917, the Senate had no cloture rule at all, \n     although one had been discussed since the days of Henry Clay \n     and Daniel Webster. The ability of Senators to filibuster any \n     effort to create a cloture rule put the body in a quandary: \n     debate on a possible cloture rule could not be foreclosed \n     without some form of cloture device.\n       The logjam was broken when first term Senator Thomas Walsh \n     announced his intention to exercise a version of the \n     constitutional option so that the Senate could create a \n     cloture rule. His method was to propose a cloture rule and \n     forestall a filibuster by asserting that the Senate could \n     operate under general parliamentary law while considering the \n     proposed rule. Doing so would permit the Senate to avail \n     itself of a motion for the previous question to terminate \n     debate--a standard feature of general parliamentary law. \n     [Gold & Gupta, 28 Harv. J. L. Pub. Pol'y at 220-226.] In this \n     climate, Senate leaders quickly entered into negotiations to \n     craft a cloture rule. [Gold & Gupta, 28 Harv. J. L. Pub. \n     Pol'y at 226.] Negotiators produced a rule that was adopted, \n     76-3, with the opposing Senators choosing not to filibuster. \n     [Gold & Gupta, 28 Harv. J. L. Pub. Pol'y at 226.] But it was \n     only after Senator Walsh made clear that he intended to press \n     the constitutional option that those negotiations bore fruit. \n     As Senator Clinton Anderson would remark in 1953, ``Senator \n     Walsh won without firing a shot.'' [Gold & Gupta, 28 Harv. J. \n     L. Pub. Pol'y at 227.]\n       The same pattern repeated in 1959, 1975, and 1979. In each \n     case, the Senate faced a concerted effort by an apparent \n     majority of Senators to exercise the constitutional option to \n     make changes to Senate rules. In 1959, some Senators \n     threatened to exercise the constitutional option in order to \n     change the cloture requirements of Rule XXII. Then-Majority \n     Leader Lyndon Johnson preempted its use by offering a \n     modification to Rule XXII that was adopted through the \n     regular order. [Gold & Gupta, 28 Harv. J. L. Pub. Pol'y at \n     240-247.] In 1975, the Senate three times formally endorsed \n     the constitutional option by creating precedents aimed at \n     facilitating rule changes by majority vote, although the \n     ultimate rule change (also to Rule XXII) was implemented \n     through the regular order after off-the-Floor negotiations. \n     [Gold & Gupta, 28 Harv. J. L. Pub. Pol'y at 252-260.] And in \n     1979, Majority Leader Byrd threatened to use the \n     constitutional option unless the Senate consented to a time \n     frame for consideration of changes to post-cloture \n     procedures. The Senate acquiesced, and the Majority Leader \n     did not need to use the constitutional option as he had in \n     the other cases discussed above. [Gold & Gupta, 28 Harv. J. \n     L. Pub. Pol'y at 260; Congressional Record, Jan. 15, 1979.]\n       The Senate, therefore, has long accepted the legitimacy of \n     the constitutional option. Through precedent, the option has \n     been exercised and Senate procedures have been changed. At \n     other times it has been merely threatened, and Senators \n     negotiated textual rules changes through the regular order. \n     But regardless of the outcome, the constitutional option has \n     played an ongoing and important role.\n\n\n         The Judicial Filibuster and the Constitutional Option\n\n       The filibusters of judicial nominations during the 108th \n     Congress were unprecedented in Senate history. [This \n     historical observation has been conceded by leading Senate \n     Democrats. For example, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign \n     Committee solicited campaign contributions in November 2003 \n     with the claim that the filibusters were an ``unprecedented'' \n     effort to ``save our courts.'' See Senator John Cornyn, \n     Congressional Record, Nov. 12, 2003, S14601, S14605. No \n     Senator has disputed that until Miguel Estrada asked the \n     President to withdraw his nomination in September 2003, no \n     circuit court nominee had ever been withdrawn or defeated for \n     confirmation due to the refusal of a minority to permit an \n     up-or-down vote on the Senate floor.] While cloture votes had \n     been necessary for a few nominees in previous years, leaders \n     from both parties consistently worked together to ensure that \n     nominees who reached the Senate floor received up-or-down \n     votes. The result of this bipartisan cooperation was that, \n     until 2003, no judicial nominee with clear majority support \n     had ever been defeated due to a refusal by a Senate minority \n     to permit an up-or-down floor vote, i.e., a filibuster. [For \n     a review of all past cloture votes on judicial nominations \n     prior to the 108th Congress, see Senate Republican Policy \n     Committee, ``Denying Mr. Estrada an Up-or-Down Vote Would Set \n     a Dangerous Precedent'' (Feb. 10, 2003). See also Cornyn, 27 \n     Harv. J. L. Pub. Pol'y at 218-227.]\n\n[[Page S5512]]\n\n       The best illustration of this traditional norm is the March \n     2000 treatment of President Bill Clinton's nominations of \n     Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon to the U.S. Court of Appeals \n     for the Ninth Circuit. When those nominations reached the \n     Senate floor, Majority Leader Trent Lott, working with \n     Democrat Leader Tom Daschle, filed cloture before any \n     filibuster could materialize. Republican Judiciary Chairman \n     Orrin Hatch likewise fought to preserve Senate norms and \n     traditions, arguing that it would be ``a travesty if we \n     establish a routine of filibustering judges.'' [Congressional \n     Record, Mar. 8, 2000, S1297.] Moreover, as a further \n     testament to the bipartisan opposition to filibusters for \n     judicial nominations, more than 20 Republicans who opposed \n     the nominations and who would vote against them nonetheless \n     supported cloture for Mr. Paez and Ms. Berzon, and cloture \n     was easily reached. [For Berzon, compare Record Vote #36 \n     (cloture invoked, 86-13) with #38 (confirmed, 64-34); for \n     Paez, compare Record Vote #37 (cloture invoked, 85-14) with \n     #40 (confirmed, 59-39). All votes on Mar. 8-9, 2000.] Had \n     every Senator who voted against Mr. Paez's nomination \n     likewise voted against cloture, cloture would not have been \n     invoked. Thus, as recently as March 2000, more than 80 \n     Senators were on record opposing the filibuster of judicial \n     nominations. [For a more detailed list of Senators' historic \n     opposition to filibusters for judicial nominations, see \n     Senate Republican Policy Committee, ``Denying Mr. Estrada an \n     Up-or-Down Vote Would Set a Dangerous Precedent'' (Feb. 10, \n     2003). For an extended examination of filibustering Senators' \n     previous opposition to judicial filibusters, see Cornyn, 27 \n     Harv. J. L. Pub. Pol'y at 207-211.] If the new judicial \n     nomination filibusters are accepted as a norm, then the \n     Senate will be rejecting this history and charting a new \n     course.\n       It is not only the Senate norm regarding not filibustering \n     judicial nominations that risks being transformed, but the \n     effective constitutional standard for the confirmation of \n     judicial nominations. There can be no serious dispute that \n     the Constitution requires only a Senate majority for \n     confirmation. Indeed, many judicial nominees have been \n     confirmed by fewer than 60 votes in the past--including three \n     Clinton nominees and two Carter nominees. [Examples of \n     judicial nominations made prior to the 108th Congress that \n     were confirmed with fewer than 60 votes include Abner Mikva \n     (D.C. Cir., 1979); L.T. Senter (N.D. Miss., 1979); J. Harvie \n     Wilkinson III (4th Cir., 1984); Alex Kozinski (9th Cir., \n     1985); Sidney Fitzwater (N.D. Tex., 1986); Daniel Manion (7th \n     Cir., 1986); Clarence Thomas (Supreme Court, 1991); Susan \n     Mollway (D. Haw., 1998); William Fletcher (9th Cir., 1998); \n     Richard Paez (9th Cir., 2000); and Dennis Shedd (4th Cir., \n     2002).] Never has the Senate claimed that a supermajority is \n     necessary for confirmation.\n       Recently, however, some filibustering Senators have \n     suggested that a failed cloture vote is tantamount to an up-\n     or-down vote on a judicial nomination. The new Senate \n     Minority Leader, Harry Reid, has stated that the 10 \n     filibustered judges have been ``turned down.'' [William C. \n     Mann, Senate leaders draw line on filibuster of judicial \n     nominees, Boston Globe, Jan. 17, 2005.] Senator Charles \n     Schumer has repeatedly stated that a failed cloture vote is \n     evidence that the Senate has ``rejected'' a nomination. \n     [Senator Charles Schumer, Congressional Record, July 22, \n     2004, S8585 (``I remind the American people that now 200 \n     judges have been approved and 6 have been rejected''); see \n     also Jeffrey McMurray, Pryor Supporters Debate Timing of \n     Vote, Tuscaloosa News, Jan. 10, 2005 (``To nominate judges \n     previously rejected by the Senate is wrong''); Anne Kornblut, \n     Bush Set to Try Again on Blocked Judicial Nominees, Boston \n     Globe, Dec. 24, 2004 (quoting official statement by Sen. \n     Schumer).] Senator Russell Feingold described the \n     filibustered nominees from the 108th Congress as having \n     ``been duly considered by the Senate and rejected.'' [Keith \n     Perine, Fiercest Fight in Partisan War May Be Over Supreme \n     Court, CQ Weekly, Jan. 10, 2005, at 59.] Judiciary Committee \n     Ranking Member Patrick Leahy has referred to the filibustered \n     nominees as having been ``effectively rejected.'' \n     [Congressional Record, Feb. 27, 2004, S1887.] And in April \n     2005, Senator Joseph Lieberman claimed that 60 votes should \n     be the ``minimum'' for confirmation. [Senator Joseph \n     Lieberman, Transcript of Press Conference, Apr. 21, 2005.] \n     These characterizations illustrate the extent to which the \n     Senate has lost its moorings.\n       Without restoration of the majority-vote standard, judicial \n     nominations will require an extra-constitutional \n     supermajority to be confirmed, without any constitutional \n     amendment--or even a Senate consensus--supporting that \n     change. Any exercise of the constitutional option would, \n     therefore, be aimed at restoring the Senate's procedures to \n     conform to its traditional norms and practices in dealing \n     with judicial nominations. It would return the Senate to the \n     Constitution's majority-vote confirmation standard. And it \n     would prevent the Senate from abusing procedural rules to \n     create supermajority requirements. Instead, it would be \n     restorative, and Democrats and Republicans alike would \n     operate in the system that served the nation until the 108th \n     Congress.\n\n\n         Common Misunderstandings of the Constitutional Option\n\n       Senate procedures are sacrosanct and cannot be changed by \n     the constitutional option.\n       This misunderstanding does not square with history. As \n     discussed, the constitutional option has been used multiple \n     times to change the Senate's practices through the creation \n     of new precedents. Also, the Senate has changed its Standing \n     Rules several times under the threat of the constitutional \n     option.\n       Exercising the constitutional option will destroy the \n     filibuster for legislation. The history of the use of the \n     constitutional option suggests that this concern is grossly \n     overstated. Senators will only exercise the constitutional \n     option when they are willing to live with the rule that is \n     created, regardless of which party controls the body. For \n     the very few Senators (if any) who today want to eliminate \n     the legislative filibuster by majority vote, the roadmap \n     has existed since as early as 1917. Moreover, an exercise \n     of the constitutional option to restore the norms for \n     judicial confirmations would be just that--an act of \n     restoration. To eliminate the legislative filibuster would \n     not be restorative of Senate norms and traditions; it \n     would destroy the Senate's longstanding respect for the \n     legislative filibuster as a vehicle to protect Senators' \n     rights to amend and debate. It is also worth noting that \n     the Senate is now entering its 30th year of bipartisan \n     consensus as to the cloture threshold (three-fifths of \n     those duly chosen and sworn) for legislative filibusters. \n     [In 1995, Senators Tom Harkin and Joe Lieberman proposed a \n     major revision to the Senate filibuster rules for \n     legislation, but the proposal failed 76-19, attracting the \n     support of no Republicans and but a fraction of Democrats \n     (who were in the minority). The only current Senators who \n     sought to change the Senate's consensus position on \n     legislative filibusters were Senators Jeff Bingaman, \n     Barbara Boxer, Russell Feingold, Tom Harkin, Edward \n     Kennedy, John Kerry, Frank Lautenberg, Joe Lieberman, and \n     Paul Sarbanes. See Record Vote #1 (Jan. 5, 1995).]\n       All procedural changes must be made at the beginning of a \n     Congress. Again, this claim does not square with history. In \n     fact, there is nothing special about the beginning of a \n     Congress vis-a-vis the Senate's right to establish its own \n     practices and procedures, or even its formal Standing Rules. \n     As discussed above, Majority Leader Byrd used the \n     constitutional option to create a precedent that overrode \n     Rule XVI's plain text--and not at the beginning of a \n     Congress. Moreover, as the Supreme Court held in Ballin, each \n     House of Congress's constitutional power to make procedural \n     rules is of equal value at all times. [Ballin, 144 U.S. at \n     5.]\n       The essential character of the Senate will be destroyed if \n     the constitutional option is exercised. When Majority Leader \n     Byrd repeatedly exercised the constitutional option to \n     correct abuses of Senate rules and precedents, those \n     illustrative exercises of the option did little to upset the \n     basic character of the Senate. Indeed, many observers argue \n     that the Senate minority is stronger today in a body that \n     still allows for extensive debate, full consideration, and \n     careful deliberation of all matters with which it is \n     presented.\n       Exercising the constitutional option would turn the Senate \n     into a ``rubber stamp.'' Again, history proves otherwise. The \n     Senate has repeatedly exercised its constitutional power to \n     reject judicial nominations through straightforward denials \n     of ``consent'' by up-or-down votes. For example, the Senate \n     defeated the Supreme Court nominations of Robert Bork (1987), \n     G. Harold Carswell (1970), and Clement Haynsworth (1969) on \n     up-or-down votes. [See Record Vote #348 (Oct. 23, 1987) \n     (defeated 42-58); Record Vote #112 (Apr. 8, 1970) (defeated \n     45-51); Record Vote #135 (Nov. 21, 1969) (defeated 45-55).] \n     Even in the 10Sth Congress, when the Senate voted on the \n     nomination of J. Leon Holmes to a federal district court in \n     Arkansas, five Republicans voted against President Bush's \n     nominee. Had several Democrats not voted for Mr. Holmes, he \n     would not have been confirmed. [Record Vote #153 (July \n     6,2004) (confirmed 51-46).] In other words, the Senate still \n     has the ability to work its will in a nonpartisan fashion as \n     long as the minority permits the body to come to up-or-down \n     votes. Members from both parties will ensure that the Senate \n     does its constitutional duty by carefully evaluating all \n     nominees.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n       Can the Senate restore order when a minority of its members \n     chooses to upset tradition? Does the Constitution empower the \n     Senate to act so that it need not acquiesce whenever a \n     minority decides that the practices, procedures, and rules \n     should be changed? Can the Senate majority--not necessarily a \n     partisan majority, but simply a majority of Senators--act to \n     return the Senate to its previously agreed-upon norms and \n     practices? The answer to all these questions is a clear yes. \n     The Senate would be acting well within its traditions if it \n     were to restore the longstanding procedural norms so that the \n     majority standard for confirmation is preserved and nominees \n     who reach the Senate floor do not fall victim to filibusters.\n  Mr. KYL. These precedents--in 1977, 1979, 1980, and in 1987--bear \ndirectly on the situation the Senate faces today. In those instances, \nSenate business was being obstructed by dilatory tactics that had not \ntraditionally been employed but which were permitted under the rules. \nThe Senate faced the same conundrum as it does today: Must the Senate \npermit rule by the minority, or can it exercise its constitutional \npower to restore traditional practices? In\n\n[[Page S5513]]\n\neach case, the Senate did the latter. It created precedents that \naltered the practices and procedures and, in some cases, operation of \nthe standing rules themselves in order to ensure that tradition was \nupheld.\n  What did not happen as a result of these earlier exercises of the \nconstitutional option?\n  Well, first, the Senate did not collapse or become ``like the House \nof Representatives,'' which is the fear of many Senators today.\n  Second, Senators' speech rights are just as strong as ever. Nor were \nAmericans' free speech rights injured, as some Senators say will \nhappen.\n  Third, minority rights were not destroyed. The Senate minority is as \nvibrant as ever and has been remarkably successful in obstructing the \nbusiness of the Senate, whether we are talking about the Energy bill, \nmedical liability lawsuit reform, asbestos reform, tax relief, or other \nissues.\n  Before I close, I would like to address concerns that some of my \nconservative friends have recently expressed. Some are fretting that \nRepublicans are taking a dangerous step by restoring the traditional \nup-or-down vote standard for judicial nominees. My friends argue that \nRepublicans may want to filibuster a future Democratic President's \nnominees. To that I say, I do not think so. And even if true, I am \nwilling to give up that tool. It was never a power we thought we had in \nthe past, and it is not one likely to be used in the future, unless \nthat longstanding tradition is abdicated.\n  I know some insist we will someday want to block judges by \nfilibuster, but I know my colleagues. I have heard them speak \npassionately, publicly and privately, about the injustice done to \nfilibustered nominees. I think it highly unlikely that they will shift \ntheir views simply because the political worm has turned, again, if we \nsustain the tradition of the Senate. So I say to my friends what you \nsay that we Republicans are losing is in fact no loss at all.\n  My friends also argue that the legislative filibuster will be next. I \nhave even seen some media outlets insist that this exercise of the \nconstitutional option for judicial filibusters will automatically apply \nto the legislative filibuster. This is completely false. Moreover, no \nRepublican Senator wants to eliminate the legislative filibuster and \nfew, if any, Democrats do. Some once did, but they recently recanted. \nIn fact, the junior Senator from California said she was ``wrong . . . \ntotally wrong'' ever to have thought otherwise.\n  Everyone here knows that political fortunes change. It is one thing \nto give this supposed ``right'' that had never been used, such as this \nfilibuster of judicial nominees. It is quite another to be so \nshortsighted as to eliminate such a powerful legislative tool. In fact, \nthe first vote I ever cast as a Senator was to preserve the legislative \nfilibuster, and I was in the majority.\n  But I think it is important to acknowledge, in the interest of \nintellectual honesty, that if the majority wanted to eliminate the \nfilibuster for all matters, including legislation, it would have \ncertainly had that power. It would be wildly imprudent, contrary to \ntradition, generally destructive of the institution, but that is what \nthe Constitution provides--the power of the Senate to govern itself.\n  In closing, I say to my colleagues what we are contemplating doing is \nin the best traditions of the Senate. We are restoring our consensus \npractices for managing the judicial confirmation process using a tool \nthat has been repeatedly used and has always been available. I look \nforward to completing this debate so that we can start voting on \nindividual judicial nominees and turn to the pressing legislative \nmatters of the Senate.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the Washington Times, May 19, 2005.]\n\n                      A Unique Case of Obstruction\n\n                         (By Senator Bob Dole)\n\n       In the current debate over judicial nominations, some \n     commentators claim Republicans such as myself are \n     misrepresenting history by suggesting the current filibuster \n     tactics of the Democrats are unprecedented.\n       These commentators cite the 1968 nomination of Abe Fortas \n     to be chief justice of the United States as an example of how \n     Republicans once attempted to block a judicial nomination on \n     the Senate floor. I welcome the opportunity to respond to \n     this claim, because the more Americans learn about the \n     history of judicial nominations, the more they will realize \n     how terribly off-track our confirmation process has become.\n       In 1968, President Lyndon Johnson sought to elevate his \n     longtime personal lawyer, then-Associate Supreme Court \n     Justice Abe Fortas, to be chief justice. I would not be \n     elected a senator for a few more months, but followed the \n     news surrounding this nomination closely.\n       There were problems with the Fortas nomination from the \n     beginning. Not only did he represent the most aggressive \n     judicial activism of the Warren court, but it soon became \n     apparent Justice Fortas had demonstrated lax ethical \n     standards while serving as an associate justice.\n       For example, it emerged Fortas had taken more than $15,000 \n     in outside income from sources with interests before the \n     federal courts. This was more than 40 percent of his salary \n     at the time, or about $80,000 in today's dollars.\n       More fundamentally, Fortas never took off his political hat \n     when he became a judge. While serving as a Supreme Court \n     justice, Fortas continued serving as an informal political \n     adviser to the president and even involved himself in Vietnam \n     War policy. It later emerged Fortas had discussed pending \n     cases with the president, an obvious violation of \n     professional ethics.\n       In fact, less than a year after his nomination as chief \n     justice was withdrawn by President Johnson, Justice Fortas \n     was forced to resign from the Supreme Court due to ethical \n     breaches.\n       The claim Fortas was not confirmed due to a ``filibuster'' \n     is off-base. A filibuster, commonly understood, occurs when a \n     minority of senators prevents a majority from voting up-or-\n     down on a matter by use or threat of permanent debate.\n       That simply did not happen with Fortas, where the Senate \n     debated the nomination's merits quite vigorously. Senators \n     exposed the ethical issues involved and the widespread belief \n     the vacancy had been manufactured for political purposes. \n     They sought to use debate to persuade other senators the \n     nomination should be defeated.\n       After less than a week, the Senate leadership tried to shut \n     down debate. At that time, two-thirds of the senators voting \n     were needed to do so, yet only 45 senators supported the \n     motion. Of the 43 senators who still wished to debate the \n     nomination, 24 were Republicans and 19 were Democrats.\n       President Johnson saw the writing on the wall--that Fortas \n     did not have 51 senators in support of his nomination--so he \n     withdrew the nomination before debate could be completed.\n       The events of 37 years ago contrast markedly with those the \n     Senate faces today:\n       (1) Fortas lacked majority support when President Johnson \n     withdrew his nomination. Today, Senate Democrats block up-or-\n     down votes on judicial nominees who are supported by a \n     majority of senators.\n       (2) Justice Fortas was politically associated with \n     President Johnson and eventually resigned from the Supreme \n     Court under an ethical cloud. No such charges have been made \n     against President Bush's nominees.\n       (3) The Senate debated the Fortas nomination only for \n     several days before Johnson withdrew the nomination, versus \n     the four years some of President Bush's nominees have been \n     pending. It's clear the Democrats today have no desire to \n     persuade, and have even complained further debate is a \n     ``waste of time.''\n       (4) Fortas' support and opposition were bipartisan, with \n     Republicans and Democrats on both sides of the question. \n     Today, the controversy is purely partisan--with only \n     Democratic senators, led by their leader Harry Reid, opposing \n     an up-or-down vote.\n       I recall two judicial nominations of President Clinton's \n     particularly troubling to me and my fellow Republican members \n     when I was the Republican Leader in the Senate. Despite our \n     objections, both received an up-or-down vote on the Senate \n     floor. In fact, I voted to end debate on one of these \n     nominees while voting against his confirmation. Republicans \n     chose not to filibuster because it was considered \n     inappropriate for nominations to the federal bench.\n       By creating a new 60-vote threshold for confirming judicial \n     nominees, today's Senate Democrats have abandoned more than \n     200 years of Senate tradition.\n       For the first time, judicial nominees with clear majority \n     support are denied an up-or-down vote on the Senate floor \n     through an unprecedented use of the filibuster. This is not a \n     misrepresentation of history; it's a fact.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allen). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, at a time when it seems like too often \ndebate on the President's nominees have shed more heat than light, it \nhas been a delight for me to sit here, as the Chair has, and listen to \nthe Senator from Arizona present in comprehensive detail the legal and \nconstitutional framework for the Senate's authority to set its own \nrules by establishing precedents, passing standing rules, adopting \nstanding orders by unanimous consent, and otherwise. It was an \nexcellent presentation and, indeed, a strong case, and that is exactly \nwhy leading Senators on the other side of the aisle, including the \nformer Democratic majority leader, the Senator\n\n[[Page S5514]]\n\nfrom West Virginia, the Senator from Massachusetts, and the junior \nSenator from New York, have all stated, as recently as 2 years ago, \nthat, of course, a majority of Senators has the power to set rules, \nprecedents, and procedures. Indeed, that is why the power of the Senate \nmajority to set rules, precedents, and procedures is known as the Byrd \noption or, as some have called it, the constitutional option.\n  Let me begin my remarks by making one simple point. I would prefer \nthe bipartisan option to the Byrd option every time. America works \nbetter, indeed the Senate works better, when we work together in a \nbipartisan way to try to solve the problems that come before the \nCongress. I would much prefer to stand up here, after waking each day, \nand conduct business in a bipartisan manner.\n  I have done my best to make the most of every opportunity that I have \nseen to do so since I have been in the Senate. For example, I have \nenjoyed working with the senior Senator from Vermont on legislation to \nstrengthen the accessibility, accountability, and openness of the \nFederal Government.\n  I have worked with the junior Senator from Wisconsin and the senior \nSenator from Connecticut on the important issue of continuity of \nGovernment in the wake of a future terrorist attack.\n  I have worked with the senior Senator from New York on ways that we \ntogether can combat modern day slavery and human trafficking.\n  And I have worked with the senior Senator from Massachusetts on \nmilitary citizenship and immigration issues.\n  I would choose collaboration in this kind of bipartisan cooperation \nany day of the week. But bipartisanship is a two-way street. Both sides \nmust agree on certain fundamental principles and a fair process that \napplies no matter who is in power, whether we have a Republican \nPresident or a Democratic President, whether we have a Republican \nmajority or a Democratic majority.\n  The most fundamental principle of all is fairness. Fairness means \nthat the same rules apply regardless of who is President.\n  Bipartisanship is difficult, however, when long-held understandings \nand the willingness to abide by basic agreements and principles has \nunraveled so badly. Where fairness falters, bipartisanship will fail.\n  So I ask my colleagues, what are we supposed to do when these basic \nprinciples, commitments, and understandings have unraveled? What are we \nto do when nominees are attacked, including being called names, simply \nfor doing their jobs, when they are attacked for following judicial \nprecedents adopted and agreed to by appointees of Presidents Clinton \nand Carter, when they are singled out for their decision on a \nparticular case even though it was held by a unanimous or near \nunanimous court?\n  What are we to do when these nominees are demonized and caricatured \nbeyond recognition to those of us who actually know them; when Senators \non the other side of the aisle call them kooks, despicable, \nNeanderthal, and scary; when nominees are condemned as unqualified or \nperhaps lacking in judicial temperament, while at the same time they \nare deemed unanimously well qualified by the American Bar Association, \nan institution that the Democrats have always revered and held up as \nthe gold standard when it came to qualifications to serve on the \nFederal judiciary?\n  What are we to do when Senate and constitutional traditions are \nabandoned for the first time in more than two centuries, when both \nsides once agreed that nominees would never be filibustered, and then \none side simply denies the existence of that very agreement when it \nsuits them, when their interpretation of Senate tradition changes based \non who happens to occupy the Oval Office and who happens to be in the \nmajority in the Senate?\n  What are we to do when our colleagues boast to their campaign \ncontributors of this ``unprecedented'' obstruction, and then come to \nthe Senate floor and claim that it is someone else who has changed the \nrules; when our colleagues justify their obstruction by pointing to \nClinton nominees, such as their most prominent example, Judge Richard \nPaez, who was confirmed by standards they now reject for this \nPresident's nominees?\n  What are we to do when our colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nclaim that Justice Owen must cross the threshold of 60 votes, whereas \nJudge Paez only required 51 votes to be confirmed?\n  What are we to do when the Democrats' former majority leader, the \nSenator from West Virginia, claims on 1 day that the filibuster is \nsacrosanct and sacred to the Founders when in January of 1995 he said:\n\n       I have seen filibusters. I have helped to break them . . . \n     the filibuster was broken--back, neck, legs, arms.\n\n  Finally, what are we to do when they claim on 1 day that all they \nseek is more time to debate a nomination and then claim on another day \nthat there are not enough hours in the universe to debate the \nnomination?\n  The new requirement this partisan minority is now imposing, that \nnominees will not be confirmed without the support of at least 60 \nSenators, is, by their own admission, wholly unprecedented in Senate \nhistory. The reason for this is simple. The case for opposing this fine \nnominee, Justice Priscilla Owen, is so weak the only way they can \nattempt to successfully oppose her is by changing the rules, imposing a \ndouble standard in an attempt to defeat her nomination.\n  Different Senators during the course of this debate have come to the \nfloor and criticized judicial decisions that Justice Owen has \nparticipated in as a member of the Texas Supreme Court. As Members of \nthis body know, I formerly served on that same court and for 3 years \nhad the distinct pleasure of serving alongside of this able judge and \nfine and decent human being. I can tell you from the sharp attacks that \nhave been made against her and the mischaracterizations that have been \nmade of the opinions she has written and joined, I doubt that many \nSenators have actually read those opinions. If they had, they would not \nbe able, with a straight face, to make some of the claims that have \nbeen made on this floor.\n  Rather than reading the opinions of this able jurist and fine and \ndecent human being, it appears the talking points they have been using \nare written, not based on what these cases actually say, but they are \ntalking points prepared by political consultants who are more concerned \nwith winning a partisan political battle at any cost.\n  A number of Senators, for example, have mentioned a case called \nMontgomery Independent School District v. Davis. That is supposed to be \nan example of Justice Owen being ``out of the mainstream.''\n  But I ask my colleagues, just read the opinion. The case involved the \nauthority of a local school board to dismiss a poorly performing and \nabusive teacher. This teacher admitted that she had referred to her \nstudents as little blank blank blanks, a four-letter expletive that I \nwill not mention on the floor of the Senate. But when confronted with \nthis, the teacher justified the use of this expletive--to \nschoolchildren mind you--on the bizarre ground that she used exactly \nthe same language when talking to her own children--clearly \nunacceptable conduct on the part of any teacher, or any adult who is \ngiven the authority to deal so closely with impressionable children.\n  The Senator from New York says this teacher was wrongly dismissed. \nNumerous other Senators have likewise characterized Justice Owen's \ndecision in the case the same way.\n  I have children. Many Senators have children. Are Justice Owen's \nopponents really arguing that this teacher acted appropriately? That \nshe was wrongly dismissed and that somehow this decision, or this \nruling by Justice Owen--I should say in her dissenting opinion--somehow \nrenders her out of the mainstream? Justice Owen simply said the local \nschool board was justified in dismissing this teacher, hardly a \ndecision out of the mainstream. I daresay the vast majority of America \nwould agree with her.\n  However, in that case the majority of the Texas Supreme Court \ndisagreed and held that the school board could not dismiss the teacher, \nnotwithstanding the fact that she conceded the language that she used. \nJustice Owen's dissenting opinion simply concluded that the majority \n``allows a state hearing examiner to make policy decisions that the \nLegislature intended local\n\n[[Page S5515]]\n\nschool boards to make.'' She also noted that the majority \n``misinterpreted the Education Code.''\n  Another case that Senators, particularly the Senator from \nMassachusetts, attacked Justice Owen for was Texas Farmers Insurance \nCompany v. Murphy. In this case, Justice Owen ruled that neither an \narsonist nor his spouse should benefit from his crime by recovering \ninsurance proceeds.\n  The senior Senator from Massachusetts says this position puts Justice \nOwen out of the mainstream. I disagree. Do Justice Owen's opponents \nreally believe that it is extreme and out of the mainstream to say that \narsonists and their spouses should not benefit from their crime?\n  I also point out that Justice Owen's ruling in this case followed two \nunanimous decisions of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, the very \ncourt to which she has been nominated. Again, hardly out of the \nmainstream.\n  How about the case of FM Properties Operating Company v. the City of \nAustin, relied upon also by the senior Senator from Massachusetts and \nother Senators? Justice Owen is criticized for dissenting in this case \nbecause she did not want to use a doctrine known as the nondelegation \ndoctrine in order to strike down a Texas law as unconstitutional. Yet \njust last month, another Senator, this time the senior Senator from \nDelaware, criticized another judicial nominee, Bill Pryor, for wanting \nto use the nondelegation doctrine in another situation. So Justice \nOwen's critics seem to be saying if you support the use of this \nparticular legal doctrine, the nondelegation doctrine, you are out of \nthe mainstream. And if you oppose the nondelegation doctrine, you are \nsomehow out of the mainstream.\n  I ask them, which one is it? The truth is, this legal doctrine known \nas nondelegation is a controversial theory that is often harshly \ncriticized by liberals who accuse conservatives of wanting to use it to \nstrike down laws enacted by the legislature. That is fine. Fair enough. \nBut that is exactly what Justice Owen's dissent criticized the majority \nof the court for doing. She stated the court has seized upon this \nrarely used nondelegation doctrine to claim the constitutional \nauthority for an unprecedented restriction of the legislature's power, \nand that the court today exercises raw power to override the will of \nthe legislature and of the people of Texas.\n  It reminds me of the lyrics of a country and western song: ``Darned \nIf I Do, Danged If I Don't.''\n  Justice Owen cannot win. She is being whipsawed by Senators who on \none hand criticize her for doing one thing, when other Senators \ncriticize some other nominee for doing something else. They really are \narguing both sides against the middle and these nominees cannot win, \naccording to that inconsistent, and some might even claim hypocritical \ntest.\n  The Senator from Illinois has attacked Justice Owen for a ruling in \nthe City of Garland v. Dallas Morning News. In that case Justice Owen \nfollowed precedents adopted by three appointees of President Carter to \nthe Federal bench. So Justice Owen is now too conservative and out of \nthe mainstream because she happens to agree with presidential \nappointees of President Jimmy Carter?\n\n  The majority opinion in that case said we should not blindly follow \nthe Federal courts. Justice Owen simply said that the courts should \nfollow Federal precedence because Texas open government laws had \noriginally been modeled after the Federal Freedom of Information Act.\n  One last example. The Senator from Washington mentioned a case that \nwas discussed in a recent op-ed in Roll Call. She claimed that in Read \nv. Scott Fetzer Company, Judge Owen would not allow a woman who was \nraped by a vacuum cleaner salesman to sue the company that had hired \nhim without a background check.\n  The Senator should check her facts because it is simply not true. The \nSenator must not have seen my letter published in Roll Call a few days \nlater because I pointed ought there, as I point out here, that the \ndissenting opinion made clear no one questions that the company that \nhad hired the rapist is, in fact, liable. The justices simply disagreed \non whether another company, one that had not hired the rapist and had \nno relationship with the rapist, should also have been held liable.\n  Of course, a number of Senators have spoken about the parental \nnotification cases. That is the attempt by the Texas Supreme Court to \ninterpret a new statute which stands for the proposition which I think \nmost Americans would agree with, that when minor girls seek to get an \nabortion, they should notify their parents or, failing that, seek a \nbypass of that requirement from a judge. That is what the legislature \nsaid they should do, and that is precisely the statute that Justice \nOwen sought to interpret.\n  I ask the people across America who may be listening to the debates \nwe are having in the Senate, whom would you trust to judge Justice Own \nand whether she did a good job in that case? Who was more credible to \ntalk about the quality of Justice Owen's legal analysis in the parental \nnotification cases? Would it be, perhaps, say, the author of the law \nshe was interpreting who supports Justice Owen? Would it be, perhaps, \nher former colleagues on the court, including former Justices Alberto \nGonzales and Greg Abbott, who support Justice Owen's nomination. How \nabout now--Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, who swore under oath that \nthe accusations we are hearing are untrue and that he never accused her \nof being a judicial activist.\n  I have seen some of the advertising that has been done by some of the \ninterest groups attacking Justice Owen unfairly who are claiming that \nAlberto Gonzales accused her of being a judicial activist. As I pointed \nout, he swore under oath that is not true. It is clear by any \nreasonable reading of the opinions that he never referred to her by \nname or was even, in fact, referring to her by implication.\n  It reminds me of what Mark Twain said: A lie can travel around the \nworld while the truth is still putting on its shoes.\n  How about the pro-choice Democratic law professor appointed by the \nTexas Supreme Court to help set up procedures under which parental \nnotification statute. Would critics tend to think she might be a \ncredible person when it comes to whether Justice Owen did a good job if \nthis same Democratic pro-choice law professor supports Justice Owen \ntoo? She said in a letter that has been made part of the Congressional \nRecord Justice Owen simply did what good appellate judges do every day. \nIf this is activism, then any judicial interpretation of a statute's \nterms is judicial activism.\n  I ask, should we trust the critics \nwho have misconstrued and mischaracterized and painted a picture of \nthis fine person beyond any recognition by those who know her and have \nworked alongside her or do you trust the people who actually know her, \nthe people who have worked most closely with her? In fact, it is the \nvery same liberal special interest groups who criticize her today who \nnever wanted the legislature to pass this parental notification law in \nthe first place.\n  It is these same liberal interest groups who literally make their \nliving trashing nominees of this President who are criticizing Justice \nOwen today.\n  As a former justice of the Texas Supreme Court myself, I find these \ncases moderately interesting reading. Most Senators and most Americans \nprobably do not, and that is fine. But we can surely agree on this. If \nthese cases are accurately characterized and understood, they \ndefinitively demonstrate that Justice Owen is a capable and well-\nqualified judge, and that of course is why she enjoys such impressive \nand wide-ranging endorsements from across the aisle.\n  We should keep our eye on the ball. Let's remember what judicial \nactivism really means because the American people know a controversial \njudicial ruling when they see one. Whether it is the radical \nredefinition of our society's most basic institutions like marriage, or \nthe expulsion of the Pledge of Allegiance from our classrooms, or from \nthe public square, whether it is the elimination of the three strikes \nand you are out law and other penalties against hardened criminals, or \nthe forced removal of military recruiters from college campuses, \nJustice Owen's ruling, of course, falls nowhere near this category of \ncases.\n\n  There is a world of difference between struggling to try to interpret \nthe ambiguous expressions of a legislative body and refusing to obey a \nlegislature's directives altogether.\n\n[[Page S5516]]\n\n  If the Senate today were simply to follow more than 200 years of \nconsistent Senate and Constitutional tradition dating back to our \nFounding Fathers, there would be no question that Justice Owen would be \nconfirmed today. President after president after president had their \njudicial nominees confirmed by a majority vote, not a supermajority \nvote.\n  By their own admission, at least at one time, Justice Owen's \nopponents in this body are using unprecedented tactics to block her \nnomination and prevent a bipartisan majority from casting their vote in \nfavor of her confirmation.\n  Again, the reason is simple: The case for opposing this fine nominee \nis simply so weak that only by using a double standard and changing the \nrules can they hope to defeat her. Legal scholars across the spectrum \nhave long concluded what we in the Senate know instinctively, and that \nis to change the rules of confirmation, as a partisan minority has done \nthese last 4 years, badly politicizes the confirmation, as a partisan \nminority has done, and badly politicizes the Judiciary and hands over \ncontrol of the judicial confirmation process to special interest \ngroups.\n  I ask unanimous consent a summary of supporting quotes from legal \nscholars be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1)\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, the record is clear, notwithstanding what \nsome opponents have said today and in the last 4 years. The Senate \ntradition has always been a majority vote, and the desire by some to \nalter that Senate tradition has been roundly condemned by legal experts \nacross the political spectrum.\n  I will close by simply reinforcing what the Senator from Arizona \nstated so well in his earlier remarks. To employ the Byrd option is not \na radical move at all. It would merely be an act of restoration. In \nfact, as we have heard time and time again, there is ample precedent to \nsupport the use of this point of order.\n  The senior Senator from West Virginia was then majority leader of \nthis body and used this on four separate occasions--in 1977, in 1979, \nin 1980 and again in 1987--to establish precedence to change Senate \nprocedure during a session of Congress. Other leading Senators from the \nother side of the aisle have recognized, time and again, the legitimacy \nof the Byrd option, including the Senator from Massachusetts, as well \nas the junior Senator from New York as recently as 2 years ago.\n  In the end, I believe this debate demonstrates, without a doubt, that \nit is time to fix our broken judicial confirmation process. It is time \nto end the blame game, to fix the problem, and to move on and do the \nAmerican people's business. It is time to end the wasteful and \nunnecessary delay in the process of selecting judges that hurts our \njustice system and harms all Americans.\n  It is simply intolerable for a partisan minority to block a \nbipartisan majority from conducting the Nation's business. It is \nintolerable that the standards now change depending on who is in the \nWhite House and which party is the majority party in the Senate. And it \nis simply intolerable that this nominee--this fine and decent human \nbeing--an outstanding judge has wasted 4 long years for a simple up-or-\ndown vote.\n  Yes, we need a fair process for selecting fair judges, after full \ninvestigation, full questioning, full debate, and then a vote. \nThroughout our Nation's more than 200-year history, constitutional rule \nand Senate tradition for confirming judges has always been a majority \nvote. And that tradition--broken 4 years ago after this nominee and \nothers were proposed by the President--must be restored. After 4 years \nof delay, affording Justice Owen a simple up-or-down vote would be an \nexcellent start.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n       Professor Michael Gerhardt, who advises Senate Democrats \n     about judicial confirmations, has written that a \n     supermajority requirement for confirming judges would be \n     ``problematic, because it creates a presumption against \n     confirmation, shifts the balance of power to the Senate, and \n     enhances the power of the special interests.''\n       D.C. Circuit Judge Harry Edwards, a respected Carter \n     appointee, has written that the Constitution forbids the \n     Senate from imposing a supermajority rule for confirmations. \n     After all, otherwise, ``[t]he Senate, acting unilaterally, \n     could thereby increase its own power at the expense of the \n     President'' and ``essentially take over the appointment \n     process from the President.'' Edwards thus concluded that \n     ``the Framers never intended for Congress to have such \n     unchecked authority to impose supermajority voting \n     requirements that fundamentally change the nature of our \n     democratic processes.''\n       Georgetown law professor Mark Tushnet has written that \n     ``[t]he Democrats'' filibuster is . . . a repudiation of a \n     settled, pre-constitutional understanding.'' He has also \n     written: ``There's a difference between the use of the \n     filibuster to derail a nomination and the use of other Senate \n     rules--on scheduling, on not having a floor vote without \n     prior committee action, etc.--to do so. All those other rules \n     . . . can be overridden by a majority vote of the Senate . . \n     . whereas the filibuster can't be overridden in that way. A \n     majority of the Senate could ride herd on a rogue Judiciary \n     Committee chair who refused to hold a hearing on some \n     nominee; it can't do so with respect to a filibuster.''\n       And Georgetown law professor Susan Low Bloch has condemned \n     supermajority voting requirements for confirmation, arguing \n     that they would allow the Senate to ``upset the I carefully \n     crafted rules concerning appointment of both executive \n     officials and judges and to unilaterally limit the power the \n     Constitution gives to the President in the appointment \n     process. This, I believe, would allow the Senate to \n     aggrandize its own role and would unconstitutionally distort \n     the balance of powers established by the Constitution.'' She \n     even wrote on March 14, 2005: ``Everyone agrees: Senate \n     confirmation requires simply a majority. No one in the Senate \n     or elsewhere disputes that.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today to address the nomination of \nPriscilla Owen to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals and to oppose the \nmajority's challenge to our Nation's constitutional framework of checks \nand balances. I also rise to protect the rights of the minority in our \npolitical system.\n  This debate is historic in the context of American constitutional \npractice, and it deals with the core of necessary consensus building \nthat has united and strengthened America throughout our political life.\n  Though I have come to the floor on a number of occasions this year to \nspeak on vital domestic and national security concerns affecting New \nJersey's and America's citizens, today, with disappointment, I rise to \nspeak--not about issues such as the safety of our troops in Iraq; \nprotecting our citizens at home from terrorist threats, whether it be \nat chemical plants or ports or airports; ending genocide in Darfur; \nstrengthening Social Security; providing access or cost control to \nhealth care; lowering gas prices, combating global warming; or building \naffordable housing--all vital issues to the American people--instead, I \nam here because some in this body think it is their responsibility and \nright to eliminate minority rights when it comes to approving lifetime \nappointments to the U.S. Court of Appeals and to the U.S. State supreme \ncourt.\n  I rise to protest this attack on our constitutional system and our \nSenate traditions. In short, it is an attack that I think supports the \nview that breaking the rules is the way to change the rules. We are \nhere today because a number of my colleagues, many in good faith, wish \nto ignore the principles embedded in the U.S. Constitution and allow \nthe will of the majority to reign supreme. Absolute power is often said \nto corrupt, and limiting the checks and balances of the right to debate \non the Senate floor can most certainly facilitate that abuse.\n  There was a reason our Founders gave two votes to each State. That \nfundamental principle was debated as the Founders wrote our \nConstitution. Today, there are two Senators from California, a State \nwith 36 million citizens. Similarly, there are two Senators from the \nState of Wyoming, which has slightly more than 500,000 citizens. Our \nFounders believed strongly in the right of minorities to have a voice \non the floor of the Senate and embedded this principle in our \nConstitution. It is absolutely one of the most essential compromises \nthat was a part of creating our Constitution. In fact, it has been the \nframework that has allowed the Constitution to work so effectively for \nsome 217-odd years.\n\n[[Page S5517]]\n\n  At a practical level, this overreach--some might call abuse--by the \nmajority is unfortunate for those of us who have been pleased to work \nwell with the White House in building a consensus on judicial \nnominations. It has happened in our State. For example, New Jersey \nSenators have met and agreed to a set of five judges, including, by the \nway, a circuit court judge who reflects the best of our legal community \nand who travels well within the mainstream of legal thought.\n  Over my 4\\1/2\\ years in the Senate, the White House and I have agreed \non an outstanding package of jurists of whom we can all be proud. And \nwe are currently working with the White House on another package--for \ndistrict court judges and one additional circuit court judge.\n  Let me be clear, while many of these judges would not have been my \nfirst political or philosophical choice, I have worked, together with \nSenator Lautenberg, and before him with Senator Torricelli, with the \nWhite House to come to an agreement on smart, fair, and hard-working \njudges for the Federal bench in New Jersey--people clearly in the \nmainstream, people of whom we will all be proud to have as lifetime \njudicial appointments. All of these are judges committed to the rule of \nlaw and not to promoting their own political views or trying to rewrite \nlaw through judicial activism.\n  I have voted many times for judges with whom I disagree on important \nissues--issues as fundamental to me as choice or worker protections. \nBut I have voted for them because they respect the law and precedent. \nWhat I cannot and will not agree to are nominees who are political \nideologues people who let us know that they will challenge precedent in \norder to promote their political beliefs and what I believe is an \nextremist agenda. They want to change the law. The job of writing laws \nis the job we have right here on the Senate floor.\n  This debate is particularly important in a practical sense to me \nbecause there is a vacancy currently on the Third Circuit Court of \nAppeals due to the retirement of Michael Chertoff, now the head of our \nNation's Department of Homeland Security. I fear this Third Circuit \nvacancy is in jeopardy of going the way of what we have seen with the \nnomination of these activist judges--jurists with views outside the \nmainstream, with extremist views, who believe that it is their right to \nmake the law as opposed to interpret it or apply it.\n  If these activist individuals want to make law--and they may have \nremarkable resumes--they should run for Congress or the Senate rather \nthan accept a nomination to the Federal bench.\n  That is why my support for the filibuster in the judicial nominating \nprocess is not about anything but the fundamental constitutional \nprinciples established by our Founders.\n  It is not about getting even. It is not tit for tat. I am not \nsuggesting Democrats should block nominations because Republicans have \nused process and procedure to stop Democratic nominees, which, in fact, \nhas been the case. The hard facts show that the Senate has approved 208 \nof President Bush's 218 judicial nominations. That is a 95-percent rate \nof approval--not too bad; as a matter of fact, I think most people \nwould think if you were hitting at that level in baseball, you would be \ndoing pretty good.\n  President Clinton's nominees were often held up before they even had \na chance for debate in committee, a different procedural process that \nled to about over 60 of the Clinton nominations being blocked. But \nagain, I don't think this issue is about tit for tat or getting even.\n  It is misplaced for others to argue that Democrats are being \nobstructionist because we refuse to serve as rubberstamps. I was not \nelected by the people of New Jersey to be a rubberstamp. Actually, they \ndon't like that kind of thing in New Jersey.\n  Republicans may one day see a change in their majority status, and \nmany of my Republican colleagues may not like this change at another \npoint in time. I don't think they would seek to be a rubberstamp in the \njudicial nomination process at that time.\n  This is not about an up-or-down vote, as Republicans suggest. That \nargument is intended to divert the attention of the American people \nfrom the real issue--the rights of the minority in the Senate, as \ndeveloped by our constitutional Founders, the U.S. system of checks and \nbalances, and, frankly, the principle of fundamental fairness, that you \ndon't change the rules in the middle of the game.\n  Here is the argument that this is not about an up-or-down vote. The \nmajority blocked over 60 of President Clinton's nominees. They never \nallowed them to have an up-or-down vote on the Senate floor and, \nfrankly, they never allowed them to have an up-or-down vote in \ncommittee. They just used different rules and different procedures, at \ndifferent time, but they accomplished the same thing.\n  Additional evidence that this is not about giving nominees an up-or-\ndown vote is the simple fact that historically the filibuster has been \nused as a Senate procedural tool, often to prevent Democratic judicial \nnominees from receiving an up-or-down vote in the Senate.\n  Since 1968, at least according to the legal scholars I have talked \nto, we have seen Republicans use the filibuster six times to block \njudicial nominees, perhaps the most visible being the nomination of Abe \nFortas to be Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. The Fortas nomination \nwas successfully filibustered and was never given an up-or-down vote.\n  But just to put it in a broader historical perspective, 20 percent of \nthe nominations to the Supreme Court from our birth as a nation have \nnever gotten an up-or-down vote in the Senate.\n  One has to put this into a historical perspective. This is something \nthat should be debated on a more fundamental level of what it is that \none can draw from the reading of our Constitution. I go back to the \nfact that there are two Senators for every State, regardless of its \nsize. The intent was to make sure minorities were fully represented.\n  Looking at this from another perspective, a more political \nperspective, I accept that Republicans hold 55 seats in the Senate and \nthat President Bush won reelection. However, neither of those facts \ngoes against the constitutional history of the right to speak your mind \nas a minority. And neither of those facts give the majority the right \nto break the rules to gain more power. The rules are the rules adopted. \nA ruling from the Chair without consultation with the Parliamentarian \nwould be an extraordinary action, certainly contrary to anything I have \nseen in the 4\\1/2\\ years I have been here, certainly contrary to what I \nhear among my colleagues.\n  A rule change under extraordinary procedures is why it has been \nlabeled the nuclear option. I would argue if the majority were to adopt \nthis procedure they would be breaking the rules to make the rules. We \nall know we are setting an extraordinary precedent--and frankly, this \ncould become a slippery slope for this legislative body, particularly \nwhen it sets a precedent that may be expanded upon to include \nlegislative filibusters, which I hear almost everyone argue is not \nsomething they would embrace. It could be a slippery slope and a \ndangerous precedent for a thriving democracy and an August body that \nhas served America well by providing for checks and balances through \nthe fullness of our political life.\n  Our U.S. system is based on the competition of ideas between the two \nmain political parties. Clearly, each side seeks to prevail. What the \nmajority is doing now goes beyond a simple desire to prevail. What is \ngoing on here is an attempt by the majority to break the rules to \nchange the rules. That violates the principle of fundamental fairness \nand actually attacks in a fundamental sense the rule of law under which \nour Nation operates. You don't break the rules to win in America. That \nis not the American way.\n  The American way is to play fairly and consistently by the rules. \nThat is all that I believe we on this side of the aisle are asking for. \nWe are asking for the right to play by the established rules that have \nbeen historically in place, consistent with precedent, ones that have \nexisted for decades, to challenge people who we believe are \nfundamentally unqualified or judicially outside the mainstream to be \nFederal judges either because of their views, which are inconsistent \nwith precedent, or because of their activist judicial records.\n\n[[Page S5518]]\n\n  Let me be specific as to the judicial nominees before the Senate: \nJustice Priscilla Owen and Justice Janice Rogers Brown. Both may be \nremarkable people in their own right, but that is not my concern. Good \npeople may not be fit to serve as federal judges because of their \ninterpretation of the Constitution, how they apply it or don't apply \nlaw, and the activist approach they take.\n\n  Let's start with Justice Owen. This is a judge who has consistently \ninserted her political views into judicial opinions. That is how I read \nthe record. She has had a record distinguished by conservative judicial \nactivism. Justice Owen has consistently voted to throw out jury \nverdicts favoring workers and consumers against businesses and she has \ndismissed cases brought by workers for job-related injuries, \ndiscrimination, and unfair employment practices, making decisions that \nare inconsistent with established precedent.\n  Justice Owen has participated in cases involving companies that have \nbeen involved in her own political activities, including Enron and \nHalliburton decisions. But the real issue, the Houston Chronicle \nconcluded, was that ``Owen's judicial record shows less interest in \nimpartially interpreting law than in pushing an agenda.'' I believe \nthis is a record that is outside the mainstream. That justifies my \nposition and, I believe, that of my Democratic colleagues.\n  As for Justice Janice Rogers Brown, a California Supreme Court \njustice nominated to the DC Circuit, she has spent the better part of \nher time as a judge attacking America's social safety net. The \nCalifornia Bar Commission found Justice Brown unqualified in part \nbecause of her tendency to interject her political and philosophical \nviews into her opinions. I don't have a problem with people having \npolitical and philosophical views. Most of the folks who speak here on \nthis floor have political views. But when you go to the bench, you are \nasked to bring an impartiality, an independence as to how you deal with \na case and how you apply the law and interpret the law. Justice Brown, \nthrough her opinions as a judge has made it clear that she has a \ndisregard for legal precedent. Justice Brown has called Supreme Court \ndecisions upholding the New Deal ``the triumph of our socialist \nrevolution.'' I believe that is outside the mainstream. Let us not \nforget, by the way, that one of the main components of the New Deal was \nthe creation of Social Security, which is now having a debate in this \nNation. It is hardly a socialist initiative.\n\n  Justice Brown has also--always in dissent--used constitutional \nprovisions or defied the legislature's intent to attempt to restrict or \ninvalidate laws that she doesn't like--as, most notably, she did with \nCalifornia's anti-discrimination statute. And so I believe that this is \na case where there is reason to believe that Justice Brown would \noperate outside of the mainstream if confirmed as a federal judge.\n  I simply cannot support placing such an immoderate judge on the \nFederal appeals court for a lifetime tenure.\n  In closing, let me return to where I began. Yes, this is an important \ndebate--maybe one of the two or three most important in the last few \nyears. I think it goes at the core of our constitutional system. It is \nunfortunate we are not here debating the real problems that face our \nNation and the citizens of my State, which include health care costs, \ngas prices, education, energy costs, and the safety of servicemen. \nThose are the issues that people talk to me about when I am out and \nabout in my home State. But the people of my home State--and I suspect \nit is true of people of every State in the Nation--expect us to defend \nour constitutional liberties. They expect us to stand for checks and \nbalances and for the rights of those in the minority so that we can \nbuild a consensus to unite, not divide. They expect us to speak \nstrongly to preserve those rights on the floor of this Senate. I think \nthat is what this debate is about. This debate is a fundamental one \nand, therefore, truly one of the most important we can have.\n  I want us to move on to the real issues of the day, and they are \nchallenging for our Nation, for all of us. Men and women are losing \ntheir lives. But there is an absolute responsibility for all of us to \nmake sure that our system works with the kind of care and \nthoughtfulness and the kind of checks and balances that have served our \nNation so well.\n  It is our responsibility to stay tuned to the historical traditions \nof the Senate and to the principles our Founders put together that said \nminorities in this Nation have a right to be heard. The Founders \nestablished that principle clearly with the Philadelphia Compromise. We \nmust sustain this principle in the days ahead in our debate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this morning, Senator Gordon Smith came to \nthe floor. He is a close friend. He made a statement relative to \nsomething I said on the floor yesterday about the nomination of \nPriscilla Owen. I am flattered he was listening, or that someone was \nlistening.\n  I am afraid what he said about my remarks was not completely \naccurate. Senator Smith made the following statement:\n\n       As I understood the assistant Democratic leader, he was \n     saying that Judge Owen's membership in the Federalist Society \n     should disqualify her.\n\n  Well, this is about the nomination of Priscilla Owen from Texas. I \nmade the point of how interesting it was that while very few lawyers in \nAmerica belong to the Federalist Society--maybe 1 percent--it turns out \nthat about a third of President Bush's nominees belong to this \nFederalist Society. I referred to it as the ``secret handshake'' at the \nWhite House and that, if you belong, you have a much better chance to \nbecome a judge.\n  I also made a point of the fact that when we ask nominees what the \nFederalist Society is and why do you belong, we get the craziest \nanswers you can imagine. There was a law professor from Georgetown, \nViet Dinh, a nice man who worked for the Department of Justice, and I \nsaid to him, ``What is the Federalist Society? Why is it so many Bush \nnominees belong to it?'' ``Oh,'' he said, ``it is an excuse to have \nlunch in Chinatown once a month. We go there and somebody talks to us \nand we eat and come back to school.'' And I would ask others, ``What is \nit all about?''\n  With the exception of Senator Orrin Hatch, who I believe was on the \nboard, or may still be on the board of the Federalist Society, almost \nnobody will talk publicly about who they are and what they believe.\n  That was the point I was making. This curious, semisecret society is \nso quickly disavowed by its members whenever you ask a public question \nabout it. Yet it appears to be one of the most important things you can \nadd to your resume if you want to be a judge from the Bush \nadministration.\n  And Priscilla Owen of Texas--surprise, surprise--is a member and \nofficer of the Federalist Society. I do not think she should be \ndisqualified because of that. There is nothing illegal about it. I do \nnot know what the philosophy is other than what they state on their Web \nsite. It is very conservative. It thinks that liberals are ruining the \nworld. It goes on and on.\n  I am not saying that if you belong to that you should not be \nqualified to serve on the bench. That is not the point. But when I \nasked someone such as Priscilla Owen, a supreme court justice from \nTexas whose time must be very precious, why she took the time to join \nthis organization and she cannot or will not answer it, I think it is \nimportant.\n  I voted to confirm the vast majority of President Bush's nominees and \na lot of Federalist Society members, so I am not blackballing or \ndisqualifying them. I know it is an ultraconservative society, whatever \nit is, and I know that so many people are afraid to even acknowledge \nthey are members when it is brought to public attention.\n  I think their views are extreme and off base, from my point of view. \nI think their views are extreme and off base when we look at mainstream \nAmerica. How can you say, as they do, that the legal profession is \nstrongly dominated\n\n[[Page S5519]]\n\nby a form of orthodox liberal ideology? Look at the 13 Federal courts \nof appeal and you find 10 of those Federal courts of appeal in America \ndominated by Republican-appointed judges. Liberal ideology? How can you \nsay the legal profession is strongly dominated by a form of orthodox \nliberal ideology when seven out of the nine members of the U.S. Supreme \nCourt were appointed by Republican Presidents?\n  So what I said about Justice Owen is that her conservative ideology \nis demonstrated by her membership in the Federalist Society. However, \nthe best documentation on her ideology is her own track record as a \njudge. So I say to Senator Smith, no, it does not disqualify Priscilla \nOwen, but it is curious to me why this supreme court justice had the \ntime to pay the dues and join an organization which she just cannot \nremember what they believe in. I think there is more to it.\n  Senator Kyl of Arizona also came to the Senate floor. He said \nsomething I would like to address. He charged that President Bush has \nonly had 67 percent of his circuit court nominees confirmed, and that \nthis is an alltime low, according to Senator Kyl. I do not know if it \nis true or not. I do not have the data going back all the way in time. \nBut I know this: If the Republican leadership had taken me up on my \noffer this morning and they had confirmed the four circuit court \nnominees I asked unanimous consent to bring up for a vote, President \nBush's circuit court success rate would be 75 percent. But I was \nreminded by the Republican leader--in this case the Republican whip, \nSenator McConnell--that there is just no time in the schedule to bring \nup more of President Bush's circuit court nominees.\n  Curious, isn't it? This whole debate, this constitutional \nconfrontation is all about whether President Bush is getting enough \nnominees. I came to the floor this morning and said: Here are four we \ncan take right now, confirm on a bipartisan basis, and get it done \nbefore lunchtime. Senator McConnell of Kentucky said we are much too \nbusy to deal with approving judges on a bipartisan basis. Instead, we \nare focused on one judge, already rejected by the Senate, who may \nprecipitate a constitutional confrontation here on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  Incidentally, President Clinton's circuit court success rate when the \nRepublicans were in control of the Senate: 71 percent. So if President \nBush had these four nominees and hit 75 percent, he has already passed \nthe success rate of President Clinton during his tenure in office.\n  So there is no vacancy crisis here, and they are trying to \nmanufacture it, they are trying to suggest that President Bush is being \nmistreated, and yet the same Republican leadership that talks about \nmistreatment could not take the time--namely, an hour or two--to pick \nup four circuit court nominees who are standing waiting for approval. \nDemocrats are prepared to approve. Of course, that would destroy the \nargument that somehow we are obstructionist.\n  I was involved in the debate yesterday when Senate majority leader \nBill Frist came to the floor and said:\n\n       I rise today as leader of the majority party of the Senate, \n     but I do not rise for party, I rise for principle. I rise for \n     the principle that judicial nominees with the support of a \n     majority of Senators deserve an up-or-down vote on this \n     floor.\n\n  Moments later, Senator Schumer of New York asked Senator Frist a \nsimple, pointed question: Is it correct that on March 8, 2000, Senator \nFrist, the Republican majority leader, voted to uphold the filibuster \non a Democratic nominee, Richard Paez? Here is Senator Frist's reply:\n\n       The issue is we have leadership-led partisan filibusters \n     that have obstructed not 1 nominee but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, \n     9, 10 in a routine way. The issue is not cloture votes per \n     say, it's the partisan leadership led use of cloture votes to \n     kill, to defeat, to assassinate these nominees. That's the \n     difference.\n\n  I spoke yesterday on the floor afterwards about Senator Frist's poor \nchoice of words. I said then, and I will say now, he is a man with a \ngood heart. He cares for people. He is a doctor who has saved lives. He \nis a transplant surgeon, well recognized in his profession as a very \naccomplished doctor. In his spare time he goes to help the poorest \npeople of the world. So I do not question that he is a man with a good \nheart. That was never part of it.\n  I was concerned with his choice of words. It was a very bad day to \nuse the words ``to assassinate nominees.'' Just minutes before, Joan \nLefkow of Chicago had been to the Senate Judiciary Committee testifying \nin very emotional testimony about her own family being attacked in \ntheir home and her husband and mother losing their lives.\n\n  I do not want to belabor this point. Let me just say, let's be \ncareful with the language we use on the floor when it relates to \njudges. I do wish to talk about the rest of Senator Frist's statement, \nnot that particular section.\n  He admitted in the course of what he said that ``the issue is not \ncloture votes per se,'' it is not filibusters, per se. And we know from \nhis own actions that the majority leader does not believe that every \njudicial nominee with majority support deserves an up-or-down vote \nbecause he, in fact, on March 8, 2000, voted to support a filibuster. \nIn other words, the thing that he is condemning when it comes to \nPriscilla Owen is exactly what he did on March 8, 2000--supporting a \nfilibuster against a nominee, Richard Paez. I do not understand that. I \ncannot understand how he can condemn that today, having done it himself \na short time ago.\n  It turns out that it is a very specific type of filibuster to which \nSenator Frist objects--in his words, a leadership-led use of cloture \nvotes. I can see why the majority leader was such a good surgeon. He \nhas taken the scalpel to the filibusters and decided which filibusters \nare OK and which are not. That really destroys the whole argument that \nthis is all about an up-or-down-majority vote.\n  Senator Frist voted to deny Richard Paez an up-or-down-majority vote. \nNow he says we need to change a 200-year tradition in the Senate so \nthat no one can ever do the same thing he did to Richard Paez. This is \nan unusual principle to try to follow. It is, in fact, creating a \nconstitutional confrontation over something that is very contradictory \non its face.\n  I believe filibusters are constitutional. They are certainly allowed \nunder the Senate rules. And when we get to the question of motives \nbehind them, I really think that the Republicans, the majority has to \ndig very deep in order to find an argument to make against the practice \nwe have used and others have used throughout the history of the Senate.\n  In addition, yesterday morning, before Senator Frist moved to bring \nup the nomination of Priscilla Owen, Senator Reid asked the majority \nleader whether it would not make more sense for the Senate to move \ninstead to consider four other nominees about whom there is little \ncontroversy. Senator Frist refused yesterday, as Senator McConnell \nrefused today. So for 2 straight days, the Republicans have had a \nchance to pick up four circuit court nominees to fill vacancies, to \ngive the President a higher success rate in filling vacancies on these \ncourts than President Clinton, and they have refused; they said we are \nmuch too busy. We have to spend time here destroying a precedent in the \nSenate. We have to reach the point when we can count on Vice President \nCheney to come to the Senate, to sit in that chair and, when asked, \ngive the right answer so they can wipe away with one ruling by Vice \nPresident Cheney a rule that has been in place for over 200 years.\n  Senator Leahy asked if we could consider a nominee from Utah, who \nwould have likely won confirmation easily yesterday. Senator Frist \nrefused. He insisted on bringing up this nomination of Priscilla Owen, \none of the most controversial judicial nominees in recent memory, \nsomeone who has already been rejected by the Senate.\n  Why would the majority leader flatly refuse every effort to find a \nway out of this crisis? I don't know. It is possible he is still taking \nadvice from people who should not be trusted for advice. I don't know \nif the name Manny Miranda rings a bell, but it should. From the spring \nof 2002 until April 2003, Mr. Miranda was working for the chairman of \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee, Orrin Hatch, and then for majority \nleader Bill Frist.\n  Mr. Miranda and other Republican staff hacked into the committee's \ncomputers and systematically stole thousands of documents, including \nconfidential memos between Democratic Senators and their staff. I know. \nI was the biggest target of Mr. Miranda.\n\n[[Page S5520]]\n\n  I discovered it when the Wall Street Journal published an editorial \nand quoted extensively from a staff memo in my office. And I said as \nsoon as I read it: Somebody stole this memo. There is no way the \nnewspaper would have a copy of an obscure memo and build an editorial \naround it.\n  After some investigation, we learned that in fact Mr. Miranda was \nbehind it.\n  Let me tell you what then-chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, \nOrrin Hatch, said. I quote him directly:\n\n       I am mortified that this improper, unethical and simply \n     unacceptable breach of confidential files may have occurred \n     on my watch.\n\n  At which point Senator Hatch asked the Senate Sergeant at Arms to \nconduct an investigation. Mr. Miranda was forced to resign from the \nSenate staff in disgrace. The findings of the Sergeant at Arms \ninvestigation were referred to the Justice Department, which then \nassigned a special prosecutor to the case.\n  Two years later, with the case still unresolved and finished, it \nappears Mr. Miranda is back. According to news reports, he is now \nhelping to lead the nuclear option fight from outside the Senate. \nYesterday, Mr. Miranda sent an e-mail to allies of Senator Frist, \ndemanding, ``a straightforward rallying cry: NO DEALS, VOTE PRINCIPLE'' \nand ``NO UNPRINCIPLED COMPROMISES.''\n  So here we have a former aide to Senator Frist, a person who, \naccording to the investigation, broke into Senate computers. He is now \nin charge of rallying the troops on the conservative side. He is the \ncheerleader for the nuclear option. And he is demanding that Senator \nFrist and other Republicans break the Senate rules to give extremist \njudges lifetime appointments.\n  I do not quite understand this. I commend Senator Hatch for the \ninvestigation. I commend Senator Frist for the investigation. They knew \nas we knew that something wrong, probably criminal, had occurred, and \nthey went forward with an honest investigation. When this man resigned \nin disgrace you would think that would be the end of his role on \nCapitol Hill, but now he has returned as a cheerleader for the cause of \nthe nuclear option.\n  It is hard to keep track of some of these players without a \nscorecard. But keep track of Mr. Miranda. He will undoubtedly pop up \nagain.\n  There is another thing that should be addressed. Senator Frist has \ngiven his word in writing that he will not seek to eliminate the \nfilibuster when it comes to legislation--just judicial nominees, \nSenator Frist said. But he also said he is leaving the Senate at the \nend of next year. He has voluntarily, on his own, decided to limit the \nterms that he would serve.\n  So the next majority leader, Republican or Democrat is not obliged to \ntake any promise Senator Frist might make. The truth is, if this \nSenate, for the first time in history, rejects the principle of \nextended debate, there is no guarantee that the damage of the nuclear \noption will not spread. In his opening remarks yesterday Senator Frist \nsaid if Republicans would vote the nuclear option, Democrats ``will \nretaliate.''\n\n       They will obstruct the Senate's other business. They will \n     obstruct the people's business. They will hold back our \n     agenda to move America forward. An energy strategy to reduce \n     our dependence on foreign oil, held back; an end to the \n     medical lawsuit abuse to reduce the cost of health care, held \n     back; a simpler, fair Tax Code to create jobs and to \n     encourage economic growth, held back.\n\n  Supporters of the nuclear option say they only want to eliminate the \nfilibuster for judicial nominees. It doesn't take much imagination to \nconsider the possibility of a majority leader in the future saying, \nwith gas prices at an all-time high, America just cannot afford an \nextended debate on an energy bill.\n  If we eliminate extended debate for judges who serve for life, why \nwould we preserve unlimited debate on the nominations of Cabinet \nSecretaries who leave office with the President who appoints them? Or \non laws that can be reversed by the next Congress?\n  The truth is, this line in the sand will disappear with the next \nwave. This is not about principle. It is about politics.\n  Many special interest groups have made it clear they are going to \nfight anyone who tries to eliminate the filibuster over legislation. To \nquote the conservative columnist, George Will:\n\n       It is a short slide down a slippery slope from the \n     postulated illegitimacy of filibustering judicial nominees to \n     the illegitimacy of filibustering any sort of nominee to the \n     illegitimacy of filibusters generally. That is not a position \n     conservatives should promote.\n\n  Quote from George Will, the grand guru of the conservative cause.\n  Former Republic Senators Jim McClure and Malcolm Wallop, both also \nconservative, agree. In a recent op-ed in the Wall Street Journal, \nthese two former Republican Senators wrote:\n       It is naive to think what is done to the judicial \n     filibuster will not later be done to its legislative \n     counterpart.\n\n  They add:\n\n       It is disheartening that those entrusted with the Senate's \n     history and future would consider damaging it in this manner.\n\n  I think that is what it gets down to. I think it is a question of \nthis institution and its future and what it is going to look like. \nToday I am in the minority. You are in the majority. That could change. \nEvery election, the people of this country have the final word on who \nwill be the majority party in the Senate. What has endured throughout \nall the changes in history from one party to the next is a basic \nconcept and that is, no matter how large your majority, you must \nrespect the minority in the Senate. It is not democracy if you do not \nrespect the minority--it is tyranny. We know that. The Greeks knew that \nwhen they invented the term.\n  Yet when it comes to the rules of the Senate to protect the minority, \nwhat we are hearing is that many are ready to cast them aside. Senator \nFrist, for reasons I cannot explain, wants to have the distinction, the \nsingular distinction, to go down in history as the only Republican \nmajority leader to destroy a 200-year-plus tradition in the Senate, a \ntradition of extended debate and filibusters. I do not think that would \nbe a proud moment for this body. I do not think it would be a proud \npart of any Senator's legacy. That is why many of us are appealing to \nthe other side of the aisle.\n  Time and again in our Nation's history when we really faced some very \ndifficult situations with judges who were controversial and courts that \ndidn't agree with the President, Presidents have said: Give us more \npower. We will control those courts.\n  And when those Presidents came to Congress, as they had to, they \nfound that even their own party would not go along with them. The \nSenators in those eras of Thomas Jefferson and Franklin Roosevelt took \nenough pride in this institution to say: We will make our own rules, \nMr. President. We will stand by the Constitution. We will not give you \nmore power.\n  But look what is going on now with this nuclear option. It is being \norchestrated by the President. And we have too many Senate Republicans \nwho are playing the role of lapdog to the Commander in Chief. They are \nsitting there like a group of cocker spaniels in a room full of pit \nbulls, afraid to speak up. They want to give this President whatever \npower he asks for, whatever nominee he asks for. What a departure from \nthe tradition of this Senate, when it was truly independent, when we \nrespected the President but also respected--maybe more--our \nconstitutional responsibilities.\n  Our constitutional responsibility is not to agree with everything the \nPresident says; not to agree with everything that he wants; not to give \nhim every shred of power that he seeks. Throughout history, Senators \nhave said: We respect you, Mr. President. We respect the Constitution \nmore.\n  In the midst of this debate, that has been completely thrown away by \nso many Republican Senators. They are so loyal, to the point of blind \nloyalty, that they cannot see what is happening to this institution. \nThat they would walk away from the institutional authority of the \nSenate, the constitutional authority of the Senate, over what?\n  Take a look at these numbers--208 to 10. How much more graphic could \nit be? The full Senate has considered 218 judges, since President Bush \nwas elected, and 208 have been approved. Over 95 percent.\n  When it comes to the 10, it is arguable who dropped out and who \nretired, but I will use the larger number of 10 just to demonstrate to \nthose who are following this debate that there is hardly a crisis. This \nPresident has been more successful appointing judges than\n\n[[Page S5521]]\n\nany President in 25 years. There are fewer vacancies on the Federal \ncourts of America than at any time in recent memory. And it was not \nthat long ago when the Republicans, during the Clinton administration, \nheld a series of hearings, which I attended, arguing that we just have \ntoo many Federal judges. Senator Grassley of Iowa, a good friend, \nchairman of a Subcommittee on Judiciary, used to hold regular hearings \ncalling Republican judges from different circuits who would say: Keep \nthose vacancies. Don't fill them. We have plenty of judges. The \ncaseload is not that heavy.\n  Now the argument is being made, with even fewer vacancies, that we \nare in a judicial crisis. We are not. It has been 9 years since we had \nso few judicial emergencies in the courts. We have been through times \nof larger vacancies and, unfortunately, the Republican majority would \nnot give President Clinton the judges he needed to fill them.\n  These are the things which clearly we find are the realities of the \ndebate. A President extraordinarily successful in creating and filling \nmore judgeships, a president who has been extraordinarily successful \nwhen it comes to convincing his presidential party to support him, and \nnow a move afoot to change the traditions and rules of the Senate in a \nway that can create constitutional confrontation, if not constitutional \ncrisis.\n  There are 55 Republican Senators. We need six--six who will stand up \nand say: History is our guide. We cannot let this institution change or \ndiminish. We will stand with those on the Democratic side of the aisle, \nunderstanding that each of us has to use our own discretion when it \ncomes to those nominees we will vote for, understanding that each of us \nis aware of the fact that the next election could change the balance in \nthis Senate so quickly.\n  One of the nominees who will be considered next is Janice Rogers \nBrown. She may be the nuclear trigger--either she or Priscilla Owen. \nThere was an article in a recent New York Times magazine about a far-\nright legal movement in America called the Constitution in Exile. This \nmovement consists of judges and scholars who believe that the right to \nprivate property and economic liberty is almost absolute. Its adherents \nbelieve that nearly all Government infringement on property rights is \nrepressive. They encourage judges to strike down laws on behalf of \nrights that do not appear explicitly in the Constitution.\n  If this philosophy sounds familiar, it should. The article lists \nJanice Rogers Brown as a poster child for the Constitution in Exile \nmovement.\n  I served as the ranking Democrat at Justice Brown's hearing in \nOctober of 2003. I asked her a lot of questions. Her answers offered \nlittle assurance that she will be anything other than a judicial \nactivist with a very extreme agenda. Her views on Government, courts, \nand the Constitution are troubling. She called the year 1937 ``the \ntriumph of our socialist revolution.''\n  She has said:\n\n       Where government moves in, community retreats, civil \n     society disintegrates and our ability to control our own \n     destiny atrophies.\n\n  She has said that politicians are ``handing out new rights like \nlollipops in the dentist's office.''\n  She claimed that our Federal courts ``seem ever more ad hoc and \nexpedient, perilously adrift on the roiling seas of feckless, photo-op \ncompassion and political correctness.''\n  She has even complained in the last 30 years, the Constitution has \n``been demoted to the status of a bad chain novel.''\n  Her rhetoric makes it clear she is inspired and guided by \nFountainhead, Atlas Shrugged, and the Road to Serfdom, more than the \nConstitution and the Bill of Rights.\n  At her hearing, Justice Brown said her speeches were just an attempt \nto ``stir the pot.'' Justice Brown's speech did more than stir the pot. \nThose speeches knocked it off the stove.\n  I have concerns about her record on the bench, even beyond these \nspeeches where she has opened up her heart.\n  In her own words, she said:\n\n       I have been making a career out of being the lone \n     dissenter.\n\n  In case after case, she has come out on the side of denying rights \nand remedies to the disadvantaged. Oftentimes she was, indeed, a lone \ndissenter and oftentimes she ignored even established court precedent \nand rulings. I have a lot of concerns about her tendency to push her \nphilosophical views into opinions.\n\n  The California State Bar Commission in 1996 said as much when it \nrated Justice Brown as not qualified for the California Supreme Court. \nYet the Bush White House wants to appoint her to the second highest \ncourt at the Federal level in America.\n  Justice Brown suggested at her hearing the views in her speech do not \nreflect the view and her decisions. The facts tell a different story. \nThere is a seamless web between Justice Brown's speeches and her \ndecisions. It is the same person. It is the same philosophy. It is the \nsame conclusion. I have concern about nominating to the DC Circuit \nsomeone with her hostility to the forces of Government.\n  The DC Circuit is the No. 1 adjudicator of Federal agency disputes. I \ndon't think someone who considers the New Deal a ``socialist \nrevolution'' is the right person for the job. Think of all the \nsocialism in the New Deal. I can think of one element that she might \ncall socialism. Franklin Delano Roosevelt called it Social Security.\n  I want to discuss her evasiveness too. She is a wise lawyer. And good \nlawyers knows how to duck a question better than a politician. We can't \nproperly perform the advice and consent function of the Senate if \nnominees will not level with us. Take the Lochner case. This is a \nfamous case that most students study in law school, certainly those who \nstudy constitutional law. In her speeches, Justice Brown has praised \nit. Now, at her hearing we asked her, and she attempted to distance \nherself from what she said before, saying that the case has been \n``appropriately criticized'' and ``discredited.'' Yet she evaded a \nsimple question about whether she agreed with it.\n  It is an important case. It is a case that spells out the \nresponsibility of the Federal Government when it comes to questions of \ncommerce and liberty of contract. It was a decision by the court many \nthought moved clearly in the wrong direction and did not even allow \nFederal jurisdiction in questions regulating health and safety.\n  Here is another example of her evasiveness. I asked her in writing to \nexplain what rights she was referring to when she said that politicians \nare handing out new rights like lollipops in a dentist's office. Her \nfull answer to that question was as follows:\n\n       I was merely commenting in general terms and was not \n     specifically criticizing a particular legislative action.\n\n  Now, in all fairness, that is a duck and a dodge. She did not answer \nthe question. I asked her whether she agreed with the Federalist \nSociety mission statement, the one I said earlier, about orthodox \nliberal ideology dominating the legal profession and so forth. She gave \nme the most evasive answer of any nominee, once again mystified as to \nwhat the Federalist Society really means, although she has attended \ntheir events.\n  She said:\n\n       As a judge, I have not had occasion to determine whether \n     the law schools and legal professors are by and large liberal \n     or conservative, and thus do not find myself qualified to \n     offer an opinion on that subject.\n\n  She did not answer half the question. My question was about law \nschools and legal profession and she did not address the legal \nprofession. I can go on, but I tell you this: She was not going to \nanswer questions. We have seen nominees like her before who come before \nus and defy us to ask questions and to have answers come forward.\n  There is a legitimate area of inquiry. I can recall when a Republican \nMember of the Senate Judiciary Committee asked one of President \nClinton's nominees to disclose every vote she had cast for a California \nreferendum for or against it in her lifetime. I thought that crossed \nthe line. There is some secrecy in the ballot box and privacy involved, \nbut that was considered a fair range of questions when it came to \nasking Clinton nominees if they are qualified. When we ask Justice \nJanice Rogers Brown the most fundamental questions about things she has \nsaid publicly, she ducks and dodges.\n  According to the Washington Post, which has defended many of \nPresident Bush's judicial nominees:\n\n       Justice Brown is one of the most unapologetically \n     ideological nominees of either party in many years.\n\n\n[[Page S5522]]\n\n\n  A Los Angeles Times editorial entitled ``A Bad Fit for a Key Court,'' \nstated:\n\n       In opinions and speeches, Brown has articulated disdainful \n     views of the Constitution and government that are so strong \n     and so far from the mainstream as to raise questions about \n     whether they would control her decisions.\n\n  That is from her home-State newspaper.\n  The New York Times echoed that sentiment and said Brown ``has \ndeclared war on mainstream legal values that most Americans hold \ndear.''\n  The Atlantic Journal-Constitution wrote that Brown's views ``are far \nout of the mainstream of accepted legal principles.''\n  The list goes on and on of over 100 organizations, including the \nCongressional Black Caucus, that oppose Justice Brown.\n  Dorothy Height recently received the Congressional Gold Medal. She \nsaid this about a vote on Justice Brown:\n\n       I cannot stand by and be silent when a jurist with the \n     record of performance of California Supreme Court Justice \n     Janice Rogers Brown is nominated to a federal court, even \n     though she is an African-American woman.\n\n  Ms. Height, an African-American women herself, goes on to say:\n\n       In her speeches and decisions, Justice Janice Rogers Brown \n     has articulated positions that weaken the civil rights \n     legislation and progress that I and others have fought so \n     long and hard to achieve.\n\n  Stephen Barnett, a University of California-Berkeley constitutional \nlaw professor who had endorsed Brown before her hearing and whose \nsupport Chairman Hatch specifically mentioned in his opening statement \nat Justice Brown's hearing, sent a letter to Senator Hatch after the \nhearing and withdrew his support for Janice Rogers Brown. This is what \nProfessor Barnett, who was once supposed to be a strong advocate for \nher, wrote to Senator Hatch after her hearing:\n\n       Having read the speeches of Justice Brown that have now \n     been disclosed, and having watched her testimony before the \n     Committee on October 22, I no longer support the nomination.\n\n  So you would hear from the Republican side that she is just another \nroutine nominee who is being beaten up on by the Democratic side of the \naisle. But when you read through all these comments of people who have \nobserved her in her professional life, those who have followed her, not \nonly fellow judges but those in the legal profession, it is very clear: \nThis is a controversial nominee. She is a person who will bring to the \nbench something less than the moderation that we look for.\n  I come from the Democratic side of the aisle. I understand if you are \ngoing to put a person on the bench, 9 times out of 10 you should look \nfor a person who is going to try to be moderate and mainstream. What I \nfound is that 10 times out of 10, with very few exceptions, that is \nexactly what we have ended up with. That is not the case here.\n  The White House strategy is unfair to Justice Brown and her family, \nunfair to the Senate, and unfair to those who want to move beyond the \nenvironment of political confrontation which has become the hallmark of \nour efforts. We should not have to go through this knock-down, drag-out \nover filling these court vacancies. I have said to Chairman Hatch, and \nI will say again to those listening, there are plenty of good, \nconservative Republican attorneys and judges who are not so \nideologically extreme who could fill these positions. You can find them \nin Ohio. You can find them in Virginia. You can even find them in \nIllinois. Why this White House continues to go after some of the most \ninflammatory, some of the most extreme judges to fill the benches in \nthe highest courts in the land is beyond me.\n  So when we find, among 218 nominees, 10 who fall into this extreme \ncategory, when we say they have gone too far, when we say to the \nPresident: You may have 95 percent, but for this other 4 or 5 percent \nthe answer is no--I think we are doing what the Constitution asks us to \ndo: advise and consent.\n  But the President, of course, says no. I want them all. No dissent, \nno disagreement--I want every single judge. Strike ``advise and \nconsent'' and put ``consent'' in there. That is what this President \nwants. Maybe that is what every President wanted. But the Congress and \nSenate in particular in the past have told those Presidents: No. We \nhave the right to ask these questions and to demand the answers. And if \nwe find a nominee wanting, we have the right to reject them, either by \nextended debate and filibuster or by the majority vote that ultimately \nthat candidate would face if a motion for cloture prevailed.\n  So in this case, they have decided that rather than hold these \nnominees to the same standard, they will change the rules of the \nSenate. That is what the nuclear option is about, changing the rules in \nthe middle of the game, diminishing the constitutional principle of \nchecks and balances, reducing the power of the Senate against the power \nof the White House and the Presidency, and saying to this President: \nYou may make lifetime appointments of judges without holding them to \nthe same standards that every President's nominees have been held to.\n  Some time next week--and I pray to God it does not happen--Vice \nPresident Cheney may take that chair, preside over the Senate, and with \njust a few words sweep away 200 years of tradition. It is an act of \narrogance to think that any person would do that without reflecting on \nthe history of this body and its traditions.\n  It is an abuse of power that this White House has to have more and \nmore power, that 208 judges out of 218 is not enough, that they are \ngoing further. They want them all. And they have found too many \ncompliant Republican Senators who have said: Whatever you want, Mr. \nPresident. Sign us up.\n  I sincerely hope the Senate rises to the occasion. I sincerely hope \nthat six Republican Senators will show the courage to speak out for the \nvalue of our Constitution and the tradition of the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thune). The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise to support the nomination of \nPriscilla Owen to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.\n  I believe it is important that the Senate take its responsibility to \nadvise and consent with respect to nominations very seriously. The \npeople who are appointed to the judiciary, as well as to the executive \nbranch of Government, can have an enormous impact on how our Government \noperates. In many cases, an appointee can make the difference on \nwhether a particular policy or program is effective.\n  I also believe the Senate should seek to work in a bipartisan manner, \nparticularly with respect to judges. Since I came to the Senate 6 years \nago, I have always been open to listen to any concerns that my \ncolleagues across the aisle may have about a nominee.\n  There has been a great deal said about Priscilla Owen and her \nnomination to the Fifth Circuit. I have heard the concerns about \nJustice Owen, but, frankly, I do not see any basis for them. If Justice \nOwen is not acceptable as a nominee to the U.S. Court of Appeals, we \nare going to have a hard time filling the vacancies in the court of \nappeals.\n  Let's review Justice Owen's record. Justice Owen has a very \ndistinguished and impressive record as a lawyer, community leader, and \nmost recently as a justice on the Texas Supreme Court.\n  Justice Owen graduated cum laude from Baylor University and cum laude \nfrom Baylor Law School in 1977. She was on the Baylor Law Review and \nearned the highest score on the Texas bar exam in December of 1977.\n  Justice Owen joined the well-regarded firm of Andrews & Kurth and \nrose to be a partner by the remarkably young age of 30. Any lawyer in \nthis body has to be impressed with the fact that someone such as \nJustice Owen could become a partner at the age of 30. She practiced \ncommercial litigation for 17 years.\n  In 1994, Justice Owen was elected to the Texas Supreme Court, and, in \n2000, as has already been noted, she won a second term to the Texas \nSupreme Court with a vote of 84 percent.\n  This is a very impressive record.\n  I am not surprised that the American Bar Association unanimously \nrated Justice Owen as ``well qualified.'' That is the highest rating \nthe American Bar Association can give to someone seeking a judgeship.\n  But Justice Owen's legal credentials are not the only reasons I \nsupport her\n\n[[Page S5523]]\n\nnomination. In an age where I believe too many people do not take the \ntime to become active members of their communities, Justice Owen has \nbeen a real leader in her community.\n  She is a member of the board of the Texas Hearing & Service Dogs, and \na member of the St. Barnabas Episcopal Mission, where she teaches \nSunday school. She helped organize Family Law 2000, which seeks to \nlessen the adversarial nature of divorce proceedings in her State.\n  She has been honored as Baylor Young Lawyer of the Year and as a \nBaylor University Outstanding Young Alumna. She also has been active in \nhelping the poor obtain legal services, as well as other pro bono legal \nactivities.\n  I think her involvement in her community is important. We need judges \nwho not only have exceptional legal skills, which Justice Owen \ncertainly has, but also who have a perspective about how the law \nimpacts upon individuals and communities.\n  I have reviewed the letters of support she has received, and I am \npleased that she has such broad support from the people who know her \nbest and have worked with her.\n  I also would like to note that even her opponents in the Senate have \nsaid they believe her to be a very good person. Accordingly, I do not \nsee any issues that could raise any questions about whether she should \nbe confirmed. Rather, she is exactly the type of serious, hard-working, \nand well-respected person who should be nominated to the court of \nappeals.\n  Some have said that Justice Owen is an extremist who will be a \njudicial activist. Again, I see no reason for such conclusions. \nReviewing her record, I see a judge who vigorously but carefully sets \nforth her reasoning in her decisions and is willing to stand up for \nwhat she thinks is the correct decision. She is not an activist. She is \nan excellent judge.\n  Any good nominee who has been active in thinking and writing about \nissues is going to have statements in their writings that, if taken out \nof context, can be made to appear extreme. This is what has happened to \nJustice Owen. Her opponents--mainly partisan interest groups--have \nscrutinized her writings, looking for anything that they could make \ninto a sound bite to distort her record. But an examination of her \nrecord as a whole reveals that claims that she is extremist are \nbaseless. Justice Owen is a good judge and would and will make a great \ncircuit court judge.\n  There is no need to filibuster this nominee. Justice Owen deserves an \nup-or-down vote. The filibustering of Justice Owen reveals just why the \nconstitutional option may be necessary. The filibuster is being abused. \nIf the minority is going to abuse its power to filibuster nominees such \nas Justice Owen, then the nomination process will break down \ncompletely. It is already too long and demanding on nominees and their \nfamilies and deters excellent candidates from choosing to serve. We \nhave no idea of what a chill this is sending throughout the country to \npeople who we would like to serve on the bench but who say: I don't \nwant to go through that process. It is a shame that such an \nexceptionally qualified nominee such as Miguel Estrada finally asked \nthat his nomination be withdrawn after being filibustered for 2 years. \nAs I look at what a clearly qualified nominee such as Miguel Estrada \nand Justice Owen must go through to serve our country, I wonder that \nthe judiciary is not going to be able to attract the talent it needs.\n  If every nominee must get 60 votes, it is clear that many posts \nsimply will not be filled. In addition, if we require 60 votes to \nconfirm nominees, we are only going to see nominees who have no paper \ntrails or records of achievement, who have done little, if any, \nscholarly work, and who avoid public or judicial controversies. I don't \nwant extremists on the bench, but I also don't want bland nominees who \nhave never had to make difficult decisions.\n  Comparing the Senate now to the Senate prior to the 108th Congress \nwhen filibustering of judicial nominations first occurred, I have to \nsay that I think the old system was a lot better than what we saw in \nthe 108th Congress. Under that system, a nominee who had the support of \na majority of Senators, who was reported out of the Judiciary \nCommittee, would get an up-or-down vote after review of the nominee's \nrecord and a robust debate. That was the fair way to proceed. It has \nbeen that way many times. It has been that way, as a matter of fact, \nfor 214 years. No judicial nominee sent to the Senate floor who had the \nsupport of a majority of Senators was denied an up-or-down vote. There \nwere no judicial filibusters. Thus, I do not consider the \nconstitutional option as a change in the rules but a restoration of a \nSenate tradition, the tradition that filibusters do not apply to \njudicial nominees.\n  My colleagues on this side of the aisle, including myself, had many \nopportunities to filibuster judicial nominees during the Clinton years \nas well as during the decades it spent in the minority. Just think \nabout how long the Republican Party was in the minority--from 1954 to \n1980. All during that time, they never used a filibuster to stop a \njudge who was nominated. They insisted that there be an up-or-down \nvote. This was the courtesy that was extended to the other party. It \nhelped make sure that the judicial nomination process worked smoothly \nand fairly. I wish the present minority would extend the same courtesy \nnow.\n  I also believe the ongoing abuse of the filibuster is preventing the \nSenate from addressing other, often more pressing business, such as \npassing an energy bill, addressing asbestos litigation, and other \nissues. I can recall in the 108th Congress hour after hour after hour \nafter hour, staying here late at night, working on these judicial \nnominees when, in my opinion, we should have been doing the other work \nof the Senate that was important to the people of our country.\n  The minority has repeatedly claimed that President Bush has had 95 \npercent or so of his nominees confirmed. Yet we all know this statistic \nis a smokescreen. The real issue here is the appointment of circuit \ncourt judges, and the minority has successfully prevented the \nconfirmation of about a third of President Bush's nominations. \nPresident Bush has the lowest confirmation rate of circuit court judges \nof any President going back as far as President Roosevelt. I think the \nstatistics show that the real issue here is not that any of these \njudges is extreme but that there is an active campaign to use the \nfilibuster to prevent President Bush from appointing circuit court \njudges.\n\n  It is the President's job to nominate judges, and it is the Senate's \njob to advise and consent. It is time the Senate started doing its job \nand voted on these nominees. If a Senator doesn't like the nominee, \nthat Senator should vote against the nominee. If someone doesn't like \nJustice Owen, vote against her, don't filibuster her and deny your \ncolleagues an up-or-down vote. I want to vote on these nominees.\n  There have been nominees in the past and some currently and some from \nmy own party who I did not support. But I never filibustered them, even \nduring the Clinton years. I can remember in our conference meetings \ntalking about judges and some of my colleagues getting up and saying at \nthose meetings: Let's filibuster this judge. We can't allow that judge \nto go forward. That judge is going to be bad for the district court to \nwhich they are being nominated. I can remember Orrin Hatch saying: We \ncan't do that because if we start to do this, God only knows where we \nare going.\n  Last time around, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nstarted a new tradition. It is not a good tradition for the Senate. It \nis not a good tradition for the people of the United States of America. \nI believe both the President and my fellow Senators, as well as this \ncountry, deserve the courtesy of an up-or-down vote on nominees.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise to speak on this matter of judges. I \nwas presiding the last hour and a half or so listening to some of my \ncolleagues speak. I associate myself with the remarks of the Senator \nfrom Ohio. But I was listening to my colleagues from New Jersey and \nIllinois, Senator Corzine and Senator Durbin.\n  I heard the Senator from New Jersey talking about the rights of \nminorities. The Senate does care about the rights of the minority. When \none talks about the rights of the minority, one normally talks about \nways to enhance\n\n[[Page S5524]]\n\ncivil rights, to make sure there is equal opportunity--that there is \ndue process of law.\n  Sadly, the Democrats have changed the rules. They changed 214 years \nof practice, which was that when a President nominated a particular \nperson for a judicial vacancy, the Judiciary Committee would examine \nthat individual very closely, as to their scholarship, their \ntemperament, their judicial philosophy, and ultimately if they passed \nmuster, that person would come to the Senate floor. Senators, for 214 \nyears, would vote to confirm or deny confirmation to that particular \nnominee. That changed just 3 years ago.\n  What is being suggested by Senator Corzine and others on the other \nside is that a minority of only 41 Senators should be able to deny a \nwell-qualified nominee the fairness and the due process of an up-or-\ndown vote on the Senate floor.\n  These individuals are well qualified, but they are denied the \nopportunity of an up-or-down vote. These individuals, as Senator \nVoinovich said, go through a gauntlet. And when one of these nominees \ngoes through the gauntlet, that doesn't last just months. It has been \nlasting for 1, 2, 3, and, in the case of Priscilla Owen, 4 years. Once \nyou get through that gauntlet, you may be bruised and you may have some \naspersions made about you and statements taken out of the record and \nopinions criticized and scrutinized and all the rest.\n  At the end of the day, when a majority of the Senators are in favor \nof that individual and they have come out of the Judiciary Committee, \nthey ought to be accorded the fairness, the decency, the due process of \nan up-or-down vote.\n  Another statement that was made is that the Senate is to protect \nminority interests. Well, if one would actually read the Constitution \nand read the documents and the debates on the Senate, why the Senate \nwas created the way it is and compare that to the way the House of \nRepresentatives is, one would find that the Senate is to protect the \ninterests of the people in the States. The Senate is not representative \nof the population of the country, as is the House.\n  In fact, the Senate was to serve, in many respects, as a safeguard of \nState prerogatives. So when the Senator from New Jersey says the Senate \nis created to protect minority rights, it is to protect the right of \nthe States. Let's recall that it was the people in the States who \ncreated the Federal Government. Note the name of our country: The \nUnited States of America. In fact, the rights of the States were so \nclosely guarded that State legislators actually selected Senators for \nmost of the history of this country rather than the people. Let's get \nthose facts straight.\n  All of this sort of talk and background noise is trying to avoid the \npoint that the Democrats' partisan obstruction of the President's \nnominees is unprecedented. We are trying to get back to the precedent \nwe had for 214 years before they changed it. It is an issue of \nfairness. It is an issue for me as a Senator from the Commonwealth of \nVirginia, the State of James Madison, one of the key authors of our \nConstitution. It is my constitutional duty to advise and consent. What \n41 Senators are trying to do is take away my responsibility to the \ncitizens of the Commonwealth of Virginia. I see nothing wrong with \nvoting yes or no.\n  Now, also in the midst of this flailing and background noise, from \ntime to time, we have heard from the senior Senator from Illinois, \ncasting aspersions on an organization called the Federalist Society, \nsaying because Justice Owen of Texas was a member of the Federalist \nSociety, and that many of President Bush's nominees for the Federal \ncourts were in the Federalist Society, he wondered what this society \nwas all about.\n  Well, after listening, I had my crack staff get on the Internet and \nget me the background on the Federalist Society. Let me share this with \nmy colleagues regarding what is called the Federalist Society for Law \nand Public Policy Studies. Here is their background:\n\n       Founded in 1982, the Federalist Society for Law and Public \n     Policy Studies is a group of conservatives and libertarians \n     dedicated to reforming the current legal order. We are \n     committed to the principles that the State exists to preserve \n     freedom, that the separation of governmental powers is \n     central to our Constitution, and that it is emphatically the \n     province and duty of the judiciary to say what the law is, \n     not what it should be. The Society seeks to promote awareness \n     of these principles and to further their application through \n     its activities.\n\n  It goes through its mission and says the purpose of the society is \nunique. They have legal experts of opposing views to interact with \nmembers of the legal profession, the judiciary, law students, \nacademics, and the architects of public policy. They talk about \nappreciation of the role of separation of powers; federalism; limited \nconstitutional Government; and the rule of law protecting individual \nfreedom and traditional values. Overall, the Society's efforts are \nimproving our present and future leaders' understanding of the \nprinciples underlying American law. They have a student division, and \nthe student division has more than 5,000 law students at approximately \n180 ABA-accredited law schools, including all of the top twenty law \nschools.\n  They have a lawyers' division comprised of over 20,000 legal \nprofessionals and others interested in current intellectual and \npractical development in the law.\n  I urge my colleague from Illinois to recognize that they have \nchapters in 60 cities, including Washington, DC; New York; Boston; \nChicago; Los Angeles; Milwaukee; San Francisco; Denver; Atlanta; \nHouston; Pittsburgh; Seattle; Indianapolis, and others. They have a \nfaculty division and more.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this statement of the background of the \nFederalist Society be printed in the Record before anybody else \nmischaracterizes the purpose and salutary goals and mission of the \nFederalist Society.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    [From the Federalist Society for Law and Public Policy Studies]\n\n                             Our Background\n\n       Founded in 1982, the Federalist Society for Law and Public \n     Policy Studies is a group of conservatives and libertarians \n     dedicated to reforming the current legal order. We are \n     committed to the principles that the state exists to preserve \n     freedom, that the separation of governmental powers is \n     central to our Constitution, and that it is emphatically the \n     province and duty of the judiciary to say what the law is, \n     not what it should be. The Society seeks to promote awareness \n     of these principles and to further their application through \n     its activities.\n       In its mission and purpose, the Federalist Society is \n     unique. By providing a forum for legal experts of opposing \n     views to interact with members of the legal profession, the \n     judiciary, law students, academics, and the architects of \n     public policy, the Society has redefined the terms of legal \n     debate. Our expansion in membership, chapters, and program \n     activity has been matched by the rapid growth of the \n     Society's reputation and the quality and influence of our \n     events. We have fostered a greater appreciation for the role \n     of separation of powers; federalism; limited, constitutional \n     government; and the rule of law in protecting individual \n     freedom and traditional values. Overall, the Society's \n     efforts are improving our present and future leaders' \n     understanding of the principles underlying American law.\n       The Society is a membership organization that features a \n     Student Division, a Lawyers Division, and a newly-established \n     Faculty Division. The Student Division includes more than \n     5,000 law students at approximately 180 ABA-accredited law \n     schools, including all of the top twenty law schools. The \n     national office provides speakers and other assistance to the \n     chapters in organizing their lectures, debates, and \n     educational activities.\n       The Lawyers Division is comprised of over 20,000 legal \n     professionals and others interested in current intellectual \n     and practical developments in the law. It has active chapters \n     in sixty cities, including Washington, D.C., New York, \n     Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, Milwaukee, San Francisco, \n     Denver, Atlanta, Houston, Pittsburgh, Seattle, and \n     Indianapolis. Activities include the annual National Lawyers \n     Convention, a Speakers Bureau for organizing lectures and \n     debates, and 15 Practice Groups.\n       The Federalist Society established its Faculty Division in \n     early 1999 with a conference that was attended by many of the \n     rising stars in the legal academy. The objective of the \n     Faculty Division is to provide events and other tools to help \n     encourage constructive academic discourse. This encouragement \n     will help foster the growth and development of rigorous \n     traditional legal scholarship.\n       Finally, the Federalist Society provides opportunities for \n     effective participation in the public policy process. The \n     Society's ongoing programs encourage our members to involve \n     themselves more actively in local, state-wide, and national \n     affairs and to contribute more productively to their \n     communities.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, the Senator from Illinois went on further \nto\n\n[[Page S5525]]\n\nchastise and criticize the statements that he said were contradictory \nstatements of Senator Frist in a filibuster, as he characterized it, in \nthe year 2000.\n  Now, if the senior Senator from Illinois, Senator Durbin, wants to \npoint to prior inconsistent statements, let me refresh his memory. This \nis what Senator Durbin said on September 28, 1998:\n\n       I think that responsibility requires us to act in a timely \n     fashion on nominees sent before us. The reason I oppose \n     cloture is I would like to see that the Senate shall also be \n     held to the responsibility of acting in a timely fashion. If, \n     after 150 days languishing in a committee there is no report \n     on an individual, the name should come to the floor. If, \n     after 150 days languishing on the Executive Calendar that \n     name has not been called for a vote, it should be. Vote the \n     person up or down. They are qualified or they are not.\n\n  Those are good words from the senior Senator from Illinois in 1998. \nThose are the principles we are advocating now. These nominees have not \nbeen held up for just 150 days. These nominees--Priscilla Owen, Janice \nRogers Brown, and others have been held up for months and years, and in \nJustice Owen's case, four years.\n  Then we heard from the senior Senator from Illinois, after saying \nthat we ought to watch our words, he called the Republicans dogs, more \nspecifically, cocker spaniels. This was all because we vote for \nPresident Bush's nominees for judges. So we are like dogs, cocker \nspaniels. Let me be like an Australian shepherd and herd in the \nDemocrats for the last few days who have been popping up like prairie \ndogs. We have heard this charge from others, including Senator Kennedy, \nSenator Murray, Senator Schumer, Senator Dorgan, and Senator Durbin, \nwho just recently made this unsubstantiated accusation that, we just \nvote for all these nominations and nobody votes against any of \nPresident Bush's judicial nominees.\n  The truth is, all of these Senators--Senators Kennedy, Murray, \nSchumer, Dorgan, and Durbin when it came to a straight up-or-down vote \non all of President Clinton's judicial nominees, whether they were for \ndistrict court, circuit court of appeals, or Supreme Court, never cast \na dissenting vote--not even once. That is a lot of affirmative votes, \nif you ask me, for 8 years of President Clinton's nominees.\n  Then I scoured around like a German shorthair, and let me point out \nwhat I found out from Senator Kennedy on straight up-or-down votes, not \nonly on President Clinton's nominees, but on President Carter's \njudicial nominees. Senator Kennedy didn't even cast a dissenting vote \non any of those nominees. To be calling Republicans ``lap dogs,'' \n``rubberstamps,'' and so forth--I don't think so.\n  Unlike Senator Durbin, we are not going to call the Democrats dogs or \ncocker spaniels. I think we are lucky dogs that President Bush has \nexamined some outstanding nominees from coast to coast, outstanding men \nand women who are willing to serve at the circuit court level, which is \na very important level of appeals in this country. He has nominated \nwell-qualified nominees for the circuit court, such as Miguel Estrada.\n  When you talk about qualifications, Miguel Estrada received the \nhighest possible rating unanimously from the American Bar Association \nand although we had, on five or six occasions, 55, 56 votes, he was \ndenied the opportunity of a fair up-or-down vote. Finally, his life \ncould not continue in such limbo and he withdrew his nomination.\n  Priscilla Owen, a justice of the Supreme Court of Texas, another \noutstanding nomination from President Bush, the person we are actually \ndebating right now, received the highest level of endorsement from the \nAmerican Bar Association, a unanimous, well-qualified. Justice Owen was \nelected to the Supreme Court of Texas in 1994 and was reelected with 84 \npercent of the vote in Texas in the year 2000. This is a person well \nqualified, well respected in her State.\n  Janice Rogers Brown, another great American life story of someone who \nis the daughter of a sharecropper in segregated Alabama, moved to \nCalifornia, ended up being the first African American on the Supreme \nCourt of California, the largest State in our Nation. She is one who \nhas been characterized as a brilliant and fair jurist who is committed \nto the rule of law. The Chief Justice of the California Supreme Court \ncalled on her to write the majority opinion more times in 2001 and 2002 \nthan any other justice of the supreme court.\n  In California, judges are elected rather than appointed and in the \nmost recent election, Justice Brown received 76 percent of the vote, \nwhich was the largest margin of any of the four justices up for \nretention that year in California, which is not a strong red State. In \nfact, it is kind of a pale-blue State. Nonetheless, she received 76 \npercent of the vote in California.\n  This individual, Janice Rogers Brown, is having to go through these \nsort of accusations against her. She is well respected, and she is \ncertainly within the mainstream.\n  I hope these rebuttals will shed some light on the reality of what is \ngoing on here. What we are simply trying to do is accord these nominees \nthe fairness of an up-or-down vote. People in the real world probably \ndo not understand this process. They do not understand why a nominee \nwho has majority support cannot be accorded the fairness of a vote. The \npeople of America understand courtesy, and they understand due process. \nThey understand the bump and run and activity that one will have and \nstatements that might be made, and you can have some fun talking about \ndogs, and so forth.\n  But ultimately, once you go through all the histrionics, aspersions, \ncharacterizations, rebuttals, and setting the record straight, \nultimately what we ought to do as Senators is our job and our duty. \nThis is what the people of America in our respective States have asked \nus to do. I really do not think it is too much for us to get off our \nhaunches, show some spine, show some backbone, vote yes, vote no on \nthese nominees, and then you can explain to your constituents back in \nNew Jersey or Illinois or South Dakota or Virginia why you voted the \nway you did.\n  What we need to do is truly take the politics out of this process. It \nis harmful that this has become so politicized in the last several \nyears. It is an issue I know is very important to the American people. \nThey recognize President Bush has a philosophy--and it is one that I \nshare--that judges ought to apply the law, not invent the law, and that \nhe has found and sought out men and women of diverse background to \nbring their experiences, but also their fundamental belief of what the \nproper role of a judge should be, and that is to listen to the \nevidence, apply the facts to the law as written by the legislative \nbranch in our representative democracy, and make that ruling.\n  These nominees are well qualified. They have gone through a lot. They \nare individuals. These are not just pieces of paper that you just \ncrumble up and throw aside. These are human beings, and they should not \nbe treated this way.\n  If we are going to be able to attract quality men and women in the \nfuture to our Federal judgeships and Federal appointments, many giving \nup lives where they can make more money, certainly have less \ncontroversy, they ought not to be treated like a sheet of paper. They \nare human beings. Let's have our debates, have the arguments, make a \njudgment, and ultimately vote ``yes'' or vote ``no.''\n  That is what I think the American people expect out of the Senate, \nand it is a shame we are having to spend as much time as we are on \nthis, but it is an important principle. It is due process, it is \nfairness, and it is the rule of law.\n  I thank my colleagues. Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Shortly after noon on Wednesday May 11, I was \npresiding over the Senate when the entire Capitol complex was evacuated \nin response to the threat of an airplane in restricted airspace. The \nofficers of the United States Capitol Police reacted quickly and \nevacuated the Capitol in record time, moving my colleagues, our staffs, \nthe press corps and our visitors to safe locations.\n  I cannot say enough about the men and women of our United States \nCapitol Police. One of their slogans, ``You elect them . . . we protect \nthem,'' accurately describes the mission of this highly professional \nforce which was formed in 1828. That mission, simply stated, is to \nprotect democracy's greatest symbol, the United States Capitol, the \npeople who work here, and its owners, the American people, who visit \nour offices.\n  When the Senate returned to its work, our leaders took the floor to \nexpress our collective appreciation to the U.S. Capitol Police. Senator \nReid closed his statement with these touching words, ``Every day, we \nsee them standing around doors, and they don't appear to be working \nreal hard, but it is on days such as this that they earn their pay over \nand over again.'' Senator Reid would know something about this because \nof all of the things on his rather impressive resume, I understand that \nhe is proudest of his service as a member of the U.S. Capitol Police.\n  It is no small irony that the skills of our U.S. Capitol Police \nOfficers would be put to the test at the very moment that surviving \nfamily members of fallen police officers from around the Nation were \narriving in Washington, DC, for the annual candlelight vigil at the \nNational Law Enforcement Officers Memorial and then for Peace Officers \nMemorial Day services at the west front of the Capitol.\n  At this time of year, it is appropriate not only to reflect on the \nprofessionalism of today's U.S. Capitol Police Officers, but also on \nthree who have fallen in the line of duty. I am referring to Jacob John \nChestnut, who was fatally shot while tending one of those checkpoints \nthat Senator Reid referred to, by an armed assailant intent upon \nentering the Capitol. I am also referring to John M. Gibson who was \nfatally shot by the same individual while protecting the life of one of \nour colleagues from that assailant.\n  And let us also not forget Christopher Eney, a U.S. Capitol Police \nOfficer who gave his life while participating in a training exercise in \n1984. I understand that he was participating in the type of intense \ntraining that would have proven very helpful on Wednesday, May 11. \nTheir names are all inscribed on the National Law Enforcement Officers' \nMemorial on Judiciary Square. The headquarters of the U.S. Capitol \nPolice is named in the honor of each of them.\n  This is the third consecutive year that I have spoken in honor of the \nmen and women in law enforcement who have lost their lives in the line \nof duty. This year, the names of 415 law enforcement officers have been \ninscribed on the memorial; 153 of these brave men and women lost their \nlives in 2004. The remainder lost their lives in other years--some \ngenerations before the memorial was created.\n  In 2004 Alaska did not lose a law enforcement officer in the line of \nduty. This year, no Alaskans have been added to the National Law \nEnforcement Officers Memorial and for this we are grateful.\n  During National Police Week we are reminded that the 17,000 people \nwhose names are engraved on the Law Enforcement Officers Memorial were \nheroes not for the way they died but for the way they lived. It was \nVivian Eney, the surviving spouse of U.S. Capitol Police Officer \nChristopher Eney, who coined that phrase.\n  For 51 weeks a year the stories behind those 17,000 names are known \nto family members and law enforcement colleagues. But during National \nPolice Week the memorial comes alive as surviving family members and \ndepartment colleagues decorate the memorial with shoulder patches, \nphotographs, stories and poems. Ultimately this material will be \navailable to the public 365 days a year at a museum that the Congress \nauthorized to be constructed on Federal land in 2000.\n  The museum will be developed, constructed, owned and operated by the \nNational Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund--the same nonprofit \norganization that built and now oversees the National Law Enforcement \nOfficers Memorial. Construction is expected to commence in 2007 and the \nopening is slated for 2009.\n  The museum will replace a one room memorial visitor center in the \nstorefront of a downtown office building and will educate millions of \nvisitors about the tremendous contributions our law enforcement \nofficers have made throughout our Nation's history. It is a worthy \naddition to the memorial and a project worthy of support by our \ncolleagues and the Nation.\n\n  During the annual Police Week observance thousands of survivors of \nfallen law enforcement officers return to Washington, D.C., for the \nannual conference of the support group Concerns of Police Survivors. I \nwas proud to welcome to my office the surviving family members of Kenai \nPolice Department Officer John Patrick Watson whose name was inscribed \non the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial in 2004.\n  Laurie Heck Huckeba, the widow of fallen Alaska State Trooper Bruce \nHeck, who gave his life on January 10, 1997, has returned to our \nNation's Capital in her role as Pacific Region Trustee of Concerns of \nPolice Survivors. She could not come to Capitol Hill to visit with me \nbecause she was busy conducting orientation sessions for the survivors \nof fallen law enforcement officers who are attending the Concerns of \nPolice Survivors meetings in Alexandria, VA for the first time. It was \nnot so long ago that Laurie was attending her first survivors' \nconference and now she is helping other survivors rebuild their lives. \nLaurie was raised in Glennallen, AK. Although Laurie has relocated from \nAlaska to the Bakersfield, CA area, it is clear to me that the Alaskan \nspirit of giving and sharing still burns strong within her. Thank you, \nLaurie.\n  Mayor Steve Thompson of the City of Fairbanks has sent a wreath to be \ndisplayed at the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial in memory \nof Patrol Officer John Kevin Lamm who gave his life on January 1, 1998. \nThank you, Mayor Thompson.\n  The names of 42 Alaskans appear on the National Law Enforcement \nOfficers Memorial. During National Police Week, which officially begins \non May 15 and concludes on May 21 we will reflect on the contributions \nof each of these heroes here in Washington and in ceremonies in my \nState of Alaska.\n  To their colleagues in law enforcement and to the surviving members \nof these 41 Alaskans and to the family, friends and colleagues of the \n17,000 men and women whose names appear on the National Law Enforcement \nOfficers Memorial, let us remember during this National Police Week \nthat ``Heroes Live Forever.''\n  In valor there is hope.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the names of these 42 individuals, their \nagencies and the date upon which each of their watches ended be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Alaskans Inscribed on the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial\n\n       Richard J.

Mr. President, I rise today to say a few words in honor \nof our country's many dedicated law enforcement officers, and to thank \nthem for their ongoing efforts to keep our families and communities \nsafe. As my colleagues know, May 15 is National Peace Officers Memorial \nDay, and the week that follows marks National Police Week. Throughout \nthis week, the United States honors the courage, devotion, and \nsacrifice of law enforcement officers from across the Nation, and \nrecognizes their invaluable contributions to the well-being of our \ncountry.\n  First observed in 1962, National Police Week also provides us with an \nimportant opportunity to remember those we have lost in the line of \nduty. One hundred and fifty-three law enforcement officers lost their \nlives while serving in 2004, including three from my home State. Last \nmonth, their names were added to the National Law Enforcement Officers \nMemorial, offering a stark reminder of the sacrifice all law \nenforcement personnel stand prepared to make to protect the citizens \nthey serve.\n  Sadly, Senior Boarder Patrol Agent Jeremy Wilson of Ferndale, Officer \nJames G. Lewis of the Tacoma Police Department, and Sergeant Brad \nCrawford of the Clark County Sheriff's Department all lost their lives \nin the line of duty during 2004. The outpouring of community support \nthat accompanied each loss underscores the immense appreciation and \ncompassion felt by Americans for those ready to help in a time of need. \nI would like to join with my fellow Washingtonians and take a moment to \npay tribute to Agent Wilson, Officer Lewis, and Sergeant Crawford for \ntheir generous spirit and tireless devotion to duty. By sharing a \nlittle bit about each of these officers with you, I hope to help honor \ntheir sacrifice.\n  Currently, there are over 10,000 Federal law enforcement officers \ndeployed along our country's borders. The deserts, wilderness, and \nrivers that line many of our Nation's edges often present these agents \nwith extreme and trying conditions that can sometimes lead to tragedy. \nOn Sunday, September 19, 2004, Senior Border Patrol Agent Jeremy Wilson \nfell overboard during a patrol on the Rio Grande near Los Indios, TX. \nSoon after, the patrol boat capsized, sending the boat's captain and \nanother officer, Agent Travis Attaway, into the turbulent, storm-fed \nriver. A second border patrol boat was able to rescue the boat's \ncaptain, but Agents Wilson and Attaway were lost. Agent Wilson, a third \ngeneration Border Patrol Agent from Ferndale, WA, was 29 years old. His \npassing leaves a reminder of the dangers faced by officers who spend \neach day navigating extreme conditions on our Nation's frontiers.\n  Often, the randomness and chance surrounding a loss of life makes the \nevent difficult to understand. Routine actions, preformed hundreds of \ntimes, can, without warning, end tragically. On Tuesday, April 27, \n2004, Officer James G. Lewis, a 19-year veteran of Tacoma Police \nDepartment, lost his life when his motorcycle collided with a car that \npulled in front of him as he rushed to help a fellow officer who had \nrequested back-up. Officer Lewis was 45 years old. He was a member of \nTacoma Pierce County Search & Rescue, and had served as a police \nofficer in the Marine Corps. He is survived by his wife and son. He \nwill be remembered for his willingness to help others and his readiness \nto put their needs before his own.\n  While our Nation's police officers spend each day working to limit \nviolence, a call for help can sometimes lead to an outbreak of what law \nenforcement works so hard to prevent. On Friday, July 30, 2004, \nSergeant Brad Crawford of the Clark County Sheriff's Department was \nkilled when his patrol car was intentionally rammed by a truck fleeing \nthe scene of a standoff. Sergeant Crawford was 49 years old. He had \nserved as a law enforcement officer for over two decades and had been \nwith the Clark County Sheriff's Department for 8 years. He is survived \nby his wife, five children, and three grandchildren.\n  The untimely and unnecessary loss of Agent Wilson, Officer Lewis, and \nSergeant Crawford reminds us of the immense challenges that law \nenforcement officers face on a daily basis. They will each be \nremembered for their dedication and their desire to serve and help \nothers. Our thoughts and prayers are with their families during this \ndifficult time.\n  National Police week is a time to remember those we have lost and \nthank those who continue to serve. However, our gratitude extends far \nbeyond this one week. Local, State, and Federal law enforcement stand \nready at every hour, and their unending courage and sense of duty \nrepresents the very best of America. On behalf of the citizens of \nWashington State, I offer my thanks to the men and women who wake up \nevery day, put on a uniform, and set out to make our country an even \nbetter place.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/19/senate-section/article/S5527-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5527-S5528]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  HONORING THE CAREER OF ARLO LEVISEN\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to publicly honor the \ncareer of Mr. Arlo Levisen, superintendent of the Grant-Duel School \nDistrict. After 15 years of dedicated service as Grant-Duel's top \nadministrator, Arlo is retiring.\n  A native of Milbank, SD and son of a farmer and 40-year Grant County \neducator, Arlo graduated in 1962 from South Shore High School. He then \nwent on to receive his Bachelor of Science degree from Aberdeen's \nNorthern State College in 1967, graduating with a degree in elementary \neducation and history.\n  Throughout the latter portion of the 1960s, Arlo taught at and was \nprincipal of various schools throughout South Dakota, including \nYankton, Pine Ridge, Kyle, Lyman, and Deubrook School District. These \ndiverse educational experiences allowed Arlo to understand and \nappreciate the various learning environments South Dakota has to offer.\n  In 1979, in addition to his position as principal of Lyman School \nDistrict's elementary and junior high schools, Arlo took on the \nresponsibility of serving as commodity supervisor of the South Dakota \nDepartment of Education's Child and Adult Nutrition Services. There he \nwas responsible for annually purchasing 22 million pounds of USDA \ncommodities and distributing them to 600 South Dakota institutions and \nreservations.\n  In 1984, Arlo became principal of the Pierre Indian Learning Center, \na boarding school created solely for the purpose of educating Indian \nchildren with a history of behavioral disorders. As head of the \nlearning center, Arlo oversaw 185 students ranging from first through \neighth grades, as well as 40 staff members.\n  Following his time at the Pierre Indian Learning Center, Arlo \naccepted the position as superintendent of the\n\n[[Page S5528]]\n\nGrant-Duel School District, where he has remained for the last decade \nand a half. Throughout his tenure at Grant-Duel, Arlo has enhanced the \nlives of countless students by broadening their educational \nopportunities. For instance, he was instrumental in opening Watertown \nHigh School's classes to Grant-Duel students, thus enabling his \nstudents to experience all that a larger school district has to offer. \nAs a result of this initiative, Grand-Duel students are often better \nprepared and able to adjust quickly to the enormous campus life that \nmany encounter in college.\n  Additionally, Arlo played a vital role in establishing the Minnesota \nBorder Schools Coalition, an association created to discuss and \nimplement South Dakota and Minnesota's open enrollment policy. Not only \nis Arlo the current president of the organization, but under his \nleadership and direction, Grant-Duel School was the first school to \naccept a Minnesota student.\n  Throughout the years, thousands of students have benefited from \nArlo's commitment to educational excellence, as have his colleagues. In \n1991, Arlo helped establish and chair The South Dakota School Group \nInsurance Pool, a health insurance pool created to make affordable \nhealth insurance available to Grant-Duel faculty.\n  In addition to the hours he puts in as superintendent of the Grant-\nDuel School District, Arlo is vice-chairman of the board of directors \nfor Pierre Odyssey World, Inc., he is a member of Capital City Bass \nBandits, a volunteer advisor to the U.S. Forest Service, a member of \nthe High Plains Wildlife Federation, and county chairman of the Hughes \nCounty Democratic Party.\n  The lives of countless people have been enormously enhanced by Arlo's \ntalent and leadership as superintendent of the Grant-Duel School \nDistrict. The State of South Dakota is a better place because of his \ncommitment to and passion for academic excellence; his achievement will \nserve as a model for other talented educators and administrators \nthroughout our State to emulate. On the occasion of his retirement, I \ncongratulate Arlo for his tireless commitment to quality education in \nSouth Dakota, and I wish him and his family the very best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/19/senate-section/article/S5528-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5528]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                CONGRATULATING THE TEAM INDIANA OUTLAWS\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I wish to inform my colleagues of \nthe remarkable feat reached by a dedicated group of young women from my \nhome State of Indiana, qualification for the 2005 USA Junior Olympic \nGirl's Volleyball Championships.\n  The Team Indiana Outlaws, consisting of nine young women well coached \nby Larry Leonhardt and Erika Dobrota, will represent the State of \nIndiana and their Team Indiana Volleyball Club in the 13 and Under \nDivision of the 26th Annual USA Junior Olympic Girl's Volleyball \nChampionships held this year in Salt Lake City, Utah. From June 29, \n2005 through July 3, 2005, the Team Indiana Outlaws will compete \nagainst a number of other national teams who have likewise qualified \nfor this tournament.\n  I commend these nine young women for their hard work and discipline \nthat culminated in their qualification for competition against equally \ndedicated national opponents. I am additionally pleased that their \ntutelage came at the hands of two fine Hoosiers, Coaches Leonhardt and \nDobrota, who have been mainstays in the Indiana volleyball community \nfor a number of years. I am confident that the Team Indiana Outlaws \nwill not only play with distinguished efforts, but also demonstrate the \ngood sportsmanship that is prevalent in Indiana athletics.\n  The names of the Team Indiana Outlaws are as follows: Coaches: Larry \nLeonhardt, Erika Dobrota; players: Sammi Deer, Shelby Hiltunen, Megan \nNeher, Alli Norris, Lauren Rafdal, Emily Reber, Lucy Reser, Kasey \nRuppe, and Allison Snyder.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/19/senate-section/article/S5528-2", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5528]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HONORING GEORGE REDMAN\n\n Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to \nGeorge Redman of East Providence, RI. The Greenways Alliance of Rhode \nIsland, the Ocean State Bike Path Association, and the Narragansett Bay \nWheelman are honoring George tonight for his ``Spirit, Dedication and \nCommitment to Rhode Island Greenways.''\n  George is an active neighborhood volunteer, an avid bicyclist, an \namateur genealogist, historian, and sailor. His extraordinary service \nduring World War II aboard the USS Mississippi began a career of \nservice to his community and country.\n  He has dedicated much of his life to the revitalization of the East \nProvidence waterfront, beginning with a shoreline cleanup that he \norganized as an Assistant Master of a Boy Scout troop. His efforts \ncontinued with his work as chairman of the Fort Hill Waterfront Park \nCommittee, the East Providence Beautification Committee, the East \nProvidence Shoreline Committee, and the Narragansett Bay Commission \nAdvisory Council.\n  I would especially like to commend George for his vital role \nadvocating for the East Bay Bike Path. This 14-mile trail, built on an \nabandoned railway connecting East Providence to the coastal towns of \nBarrington, Warren, and Bristol, has been hailed as a national example \nof the benefits of recreational trails. In the early 1980s, George \nheaded a petition effort that received more than 4,200 signatures and \nspurred the Rhode Island Department of Transportation to complete the \npath in 1992. His bike path advocacy has earned him recognition in the \nChristian Science Monitor, the Providence Journal, Rails to Trails \nMagazine, and other local media outlets covering bike path and \nwaterfront-related issues.\n  Active for many years in local politics, George was elected a \ndelegate to the 1986 Rhode Island Constitutional Convention. He has \nreceived numerous letters of appreciation and recognition from past \nGovernors and Federal, State, and local officials. It was my privilege \nto take a bike ride with George last August on the newly constructed \nWashington Secondary Bike Path that runs from Cranston to Coventry, RI. \nAs I said at the time, if the East Bay Bike Path had not been built, \nthere would not have been the momentum to go forward with other trails.\n  George has been married for 53 years to his wife, Adeline, and they \nhave two children, Paul and Mary, and three grandchildren.\n  George Redman's success in pushing for the East Bay Bike Path affirms \nthe notion that members of grassroots organizations can partner with \nstate and federal agencies to improve the quality of life in their \ncommunities. I am delighted to join in recognizing his achievements, \nand his passion for the environment and public recreation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/19/senate-section/article/S5528-3", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5528-S5529]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       ALICE YARISH: IN MEMORIAM\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to honor and share with my \ncolleagues the memory of a very special woman, Alice Yarish of Marin \nCounty, who died May 9, 2005. She was 96 years old.\n  Alice Yarish was an award-winning reporter and the Grande Dame of \nMarin journalism. I knew her during the 11 years she worked for the \nPacific Sun, exposing political scandals and pushing for prison reform.\n  During her years as a journalist in Marin, Alice demonstrated \npersonal courage and a strong commitment to social justice. Alice is \nmost well known for her relentless coverage of prison reform and she \ncontinued to fight for prisoner rights and prison reform until her \nretirement from the Pacific Sun in 1981.\n  She went on to write her autobiography, ``Growing Old Disgracefully: \nAdventures of a Maverick Reporter.''\n  Alice was born in Goldfield, NV, where her father was a judge and her \nmother was one of the first women lawyers in the State. Her family \nmoved to Redondo Beach, CA when she was still young. After graduating \nfrom high school, Redondo Beach is where Alice began her long and \npassionate career as a journalist.\n  Alice worked for the Los Angeles Express when she interviewed First \nLady Eleanor Roosevelt. Out enjoying a bicycle ride wearing shorts and \na sweatshirt, Alice spotted Mrs. Roosevelt entering a beachfront hotel \nand ran after her to request an interview. She was granted the \ninterview, which shocked and amazed her editors.\n  After her stint at the Los Angeles Express, Alice left journalism to \nattend college and law school at the University of Southern California. \nFinancial problems during the Depression led her to leave law school \nearly, and she took\n\n[[Page S5529]]\n\na job as a social worker with the Emergency Relief Administration. She \nleft this job when she married career military man, Peter Yarish, and \nmoved with him to Hamilton Air Force Base in Novato.\n  Alice raised four children and returned to journalism when she was 42 \nyears old. She wrote for the Marin Independent Journal, the Novato \nAdvance, the Santa Rosa Press Democrat and the San Francisco Examiner. \nBut it was at the Pacific Sun where she really made a name for herself \nas a unique, outspoken woman journalist.\n  Those who knew Alice viewed her as a sharp and witty reporter with a \ntremendous sense of curiosity. She took pride in uncovering injustice \nat every level of government. She stood out as a passionate watchdog \nwith an incredible capacity for building friendships throughout the \nlocal community. Alice was deeply-respected by fellow journalists, \neditors and elected officials. She will be deeply missed.\n  Alice is survived by her four children, Tim Yarish of Sausalito, \nThomas Yarish of Mill Valley, Anthony Yarish of Cotati, and Robin Ell \nof Portland, OR. She is also survived by seven grandchildren and three \ngreat grandchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/19/senate-section/article/S5529-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5529]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO GREGORY PRINCE\n\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this month Hampshire College in \nAmherst, MA says goodbye to Greg Prince, who has served so impressively \nas its President since 1989. Dr. Prince came to Hampshire after a \ndistinguished academic career as a professor of history and \nadministrator at Dartmouth College, and he has spent the past 16 years \nbuilding a strong record for Hampshire.\n  Hampshire is a young college founded in 1970 as a model of \ninterdisciplinary education without conventional grades. Its unique \ncollege setting promotes independent thought and activism on public \npolicy, while at the same time participating in a five college \nconsortium with traditional colleges Smith, Mount Holyoke, Amherst and \nthe University of Massachusetts.\n  Greg Prince is a president who believes in wide-ranging discussion, \nand so Hampshire students are encouraged to be active participants in \nthe dialogue and activities of the college. He believes strongly that \nthe institution must have a vision, and the president must support and \nencourage that vision. In Hampshire's case, the vision is firmly \ngrounded in the value of social justice.\n  Prior to his presidency, Hampshire had become the first college in \nthe country to divest its stock in corporations doing business in South \nAfrica. Greg Prince continued to set an example in everything he did. \nHe has had an indelible impact on the campus by his strong commitment \nto the college's mission of self-expression and action. He has inspired \nall of us through his leadership on issues that affect college \neducation--particularly on student aid and academic freedom. Through \nhis speaking, his writing and most importantly his actions--he has \ndemonstrated his commitment to the quality and diversity of higher \neducation.\n  Greg Prince has served Hampshire College, the Commonwealth of \nMassachusetts, and the Nation well, and I know I join his many friends \nand admirers in extending our gratitude for his extraordinary service \nand our best wishes for the next phase of his outstanding \ncareer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/19/senate-section/article/S5529-2", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5529]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO CENTRAL ACADEMY HIGH SCHOOL\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today, to \ncongratulate students from Central Academy High School in Des Moines, \nIA, who competed in national finals of the ``We the People: The Citizen \nand the Constitution'' program in Washington, DC, earlier this month. \nThe students won the Unit Three Award at the competition. This was the \nsecond year in a row that students from Michael Schaffer's government \nclasses have won this prestigious recognition. These outstanding young \nIowans competed against classes from every State in the country, and \nearned the highest score by demonstrating a remarkable understanding of \nthe fundamental ideals and values of American constitutional \ngovernment. Clearly, the future of democracy is in good hands, as \ndemonstrated by the skill, knowledge and poise shown by these students.\n  I recognize and salute the students from Des Moines and surrounding \nsuburbs who were involved in the competition: Emily Burney, Julia \nBusiek, Kate Conlow, Tim Di Iulio, Jon Hill, Lisa Jefferson, Alix \nLifka-Reselman, Phillip R. Miller, Ben Miller-Todd, David Nolan, \nCaroline Rendon, Andrew Tatge, Erin Turner, Emily Yarn.\n  The ``We the People'' program is administered by the Center for Civic \nEducation. It is the most extensive program of its kind, reaching more \nthan 26 million students in elementary, middle, and high schools. In \nIowa, ``We the People'' is coordinated by Linda Martin and Ivette \nBender is the district coordinator for the area that serves Des Moines. \nI salute them also for their hard work and dedication to this excellent \nprogram.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/19/senate-section/article/S5529-3", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5529]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/19/senate-section/article/S5529-4", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5529]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/19/senate-section/article/S5529-5", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5529]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 4:38 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1817.

In accordance with this provision, I have sent the \nenclosed notice to the Federal Reqister for publication. This notice \nstates that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13303 of \nMay 22, 2003, as expanded in scope by Executive Order 13315 of August \n28, 2003, modified in Executive Order 13350 of July 29, 2004, and \nfurther modified in Executive Order 13364 of November 29, 2004, is to \ncontinue in effect beyond May 22, 2005. The most recent notice \ncontinuing this emergency was published in the Federal Reqister on May \n21, 2004 (69 FR 29409).\n  The threats of attachment or other judicial process against (i) the \nDevelopment Fund for Iraq, (ii) Iraqi petroleum and petroleum products, \nand interests therein, and proceeds, obligations, or any financial \ninstruments of any nature whatsoever arising from or related to the \nsale or marketing thereof, or (iii) any accounts, assets, investments, \nor any other property of any kind owned by, belonging to, or held by, \non behalf of, or otherwise for the Central Bank of Iraq create \nobstacles to the orderly reconstruction of Iraq, the restoration and \nmaintenance of peace and security in the country, and the development \nof political, administrative, and economic institutions in Iraq. \nAccordingly, these obstacles continue to pose an unusual and \nextraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the \nUnited States. For these reasons, I have determined that it is \nnecessary to continue the national emergency protecting the Development \nFund for Iraq, certain other property in which Iraq has an interest, \nand the Central Bank of Iraq, and to maintain in force the sanctions to \nrespond to this threat.\n                                                      George W.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend \nthe excise tax and income tax credits for the production of biodiesel; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, today Senator Lincoln and I introduce \nlegislation to extend the current excise tax credit for biodiesel \nthrough 2010. This tax credit brings great benefits to our nation's \neconomy and environment while at the same time reducing our dependence \non foreign oil.\n  Biodiesel is a cleaner burning alternative to petroleum-based diesel, \nand it is made from renewable resources like soybeans and other natural \nfats and oils, grown here in the United States. It works in any diesel \nengine with few or no modifications. It can be used in its pure form \n(B100), or blended with petroleum diesel at a level--most commonly 20 \npercent (B20). Soybean farmers in Missouri and across the Nation have \ninvested millions of dollars to build a strong and viable biodiesel \nindustry.\n  In last years JOBS bill, we created an excise tax credit for \nbiodiesel; a $1/gallon credit for biodiesel produced from virgin oils, \nand a $0.50/gallon credit for biodiesel produced from yellow grease or \nrecycled cooking oil. This important tax credit is set to expire in \nless than 2 years. It is imperative that we extend this incentive that \nis expected to increase domestic energy security, reduce pollution and \nstimulate the economy.\n  I certainly would prefer to fill up my tank with a clean burning fuel \ngrown by farmers in our Nation's heartland instead of petroleum \nimported from the Saudis. Our farmers pose no security risks. I'm not \nalone in this preference. More than 400 major fleets use biodiesel \ncommercially nationwide. About 300 retail filling stations make \nbiodiesel available to the public, and more than 1,000 petroleum \ndistributors carry it nationwide.\n  I am pleased that we will soon have a biodiesel plant in Missouri. \nMissouri Soybean Association and Mid-America Biofuels LLC recently \nannounced plans to build a biodiesel plant in Mexico, MO. The plant is \nexpected to produce 30 million gallons of biodiesel annually. There is \nstrong support for this endeavor and they have exhibited exceptional \nleadership by bringing this plant to Missouri. I look forward to \nworking with them.\n  As I've said before, biodiesel is a fuel of the future that we can \nuse today. It is nontoxic, biodegradable and essentially free of sulfur \nand aromatics. Biodiesel offers similar fuel economy, horsepower and \ntorque to petroleum diesel while providing superior lubricity. It \nsignificantly reduces emissions of carbon monoxide, particulate matter, \nunburned hydrocarbons and sulfates. On a lifecycle basis, biodiesel \nreduces carbon dioxide emissions by 78 percent compared to petroleum \ndiesel. In other words, biodiesel is good for your car and the \nenvironment.\n  Additionally, this new value added market for soybeans brings jobs to \nour economy and benefits to farmers. Based on the USDA baseline \nestimates for future soybean production, over a five year time period \nthe biodiesel tax incentive could add almost $1 billion directly to the \nbottom line of U.S. farm income. In addition, the provisions will \nsignificantly benefit the U.S. economy and could increase U.S. gross \noutput by almost $7 billion.\n  I want to thank Senator Lincoln and Senator Grassley for their \nleadership on this important issue. We need to prevent this tax credit \nfrom expiring. It is expected to increase biodiesel demand from an \nestimated 30 million gallons in fiscal year 2004 to at least 124 \nmillion gallons per year, based on a U.S. Department of Agriculture \nstudy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself, Mr. Lautenberg, Mrs. Boxer, and Mr. \n        Lieberman):\n  S. 1080. A bill to amend the Safe Drinking Water Act to require the \nuse of nontoxic products in the case of hydraulic fracturing that \noccurs during oil or natural gas production activities; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I would like to thank Senators \nLautenberg, Boxer, and Lieberman for working with me to introduce this \nimportant legislation, the Hydraulic Fracturing Safety Act of 2005.\n  Over half of our Nation's fresh drinking water comes from underground \nsources. The process of hydraulic fracturing threatens our drinking \nwater supplies. Hydraulic fracturing occurs when fluids are injected at \nhigh rates of speed into rock beds to fracture them and allow easier \nharvesting of natural oils and gases. It is these injection fluids that \nare of high concern.\n  In a recent report, the EPA acknowledged that these fluids, many of \nthem toxic and harmful to people, are pumped directly into or near \nunderground sources of drinking water. This same report cited earlier \nstudies that indicated that only 61 percent of these fluids are \nrecovered after the process is complete. This leaves 39 percent of \nthese fluids in the ground, risking contamination of our drinking \nwater.\n  Let me share with you the story of Laura Amos, a resident of Colorado \nwho suffers from ill health effects today. In May of 2001, while an oil \nand gas well was being hydraulically fractured near her home, the metal \ntop of her drinking well exploded into the air. At the same time, her \nwater became bubbly and developed a horrible odor.\n  For three months, she was provided alternate drinking water by \nBallard, later know as Encana, the company that owned the well near her \nhome. It took this long until her water appeared normal again. Laura \nand her family drank from this well over the next couple of years. It \nwas then that Laura developed a rare adrenal-gland tumor. During this \ntime, Laura began actively investigating the chemicals used during the \nhydraulic fracturing of a well near her home. She learned about a \nchemical called 2-BE, which was later linked to adrenal-gland tumors in \nrodents.\n  Litigation over the last several years has resulted in findings that \nhydraulic fracturing should be regulated as part of the underground \ninjection control program in the Safe Drinking Water Act. Yet, EPA \nindicates in writing that they have no intention of publishing \nregulations to that effect or ensuring that state programs adequately \nregulate hydraulic fracturing.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a series of letters to EPA and their \nresponses dated October 14, 2004 and December 7, 2004, be inserted in \nthe Record.\n  In June of 2004, an EPA study on hydraulic fracturing identified \ndiesel as a ``constituent of potential concern.'' Prior to this, EPA \nhad entered into a Memorandum of Agreement with three of the major \nhydraulic fracturing corporations, whom all voluntarily agreed to ban \nthe use of diesel, and if necessary select replacements that will not \ncause hydraulic fracturing fluids to endanger underground sources of \ndrinking water. However, all parties acknowledged that only technically \nfeasible and cost-effective actions to provide alternatives will be \nsought.\n  Hydraulic fracturing needs to be regulated under the Safe Drinking \nWater Act and it has got to start now. It is unconscionable to allow \nthe oil and gas industry to pump toxic fluids into the ground.\n  My bill, the Hydraulic Fracturing Safety Act of 2005, clarifies once \nand for all that hydraulic fracturing is part of the Underground \nInjection Control Program regulated under the Safe Drinking Water Act.\n  This legislation also bans the use of diesel and other toxic \npollutants for oil and natural gas exploration.\n  Last1y, this legislation requires EPA to ensure that States \nadequately regulate hydraulic fracturing activities in all States to \nensure that companies area adhering to our Nation's laws and conducting \nbusiness in a manner safe for all Americans.\n  We need to do the right thing, and take action now to protect our \nNation's drinking water supply. According to the oil and gas industry, \n90 percent our oil and gas wells will be accessed through hydraulic \nfracturing. Congress and the EPA have to work together to provide a \nconsistent and safe supply of drinking water for all Americans.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n[[Page S5534]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         U.S. Senate, Committee on Environment and Public Works,\n                                 Washington, DC, October 14, 2004.\n     Administrator Michael O. Leavitt,\n     Environmental Protection Agency, Ariel Rios Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Administrator Leavitt: We are writing to you regarding \n     the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) administration \n     of the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) as it pertains to \n     hydraulic fracturing. In recent months, the Agency has taken \n     several key actions on this issue:\n       On December 12, 2003, the EPA signed a Memorandum of \n     Understanding with three of the largest service companies \n     representing 95 percent of all hydraulic fracturing performed \n     in the U.S. These three companies, Halliburton Energy \n     Services, Inc., Schlumberger Technology Corporation, and BJ \n     Services Company, voluntarily agreed not to use diesel fuel \n     in their hydraulic fracturing fluids while injecting into \n     underground sources of water for coalbed methane production.\n       In June of 2004, EPA completed its study on hydraulic \n     fracturing impacts and released its findings in a report \n     entitled, ``Evaluation of Impacts to Underground Sources of \n     Drinking Water by Hydraulic Fracturing of Coalbed Methane \n     Reservoirs. The report concluded that hydraulic fracturing \n     poses little chance of contaminating underground sources of \n     drinking water and that no further study was needed.\n       On July 15, 2004, the EPA published in the Federal Register \n     its final response to the court remand (Legal Environmental \n     Assistance Foundation (LEAF), Inc., v. United States \n     Environmental Protection Agency, 276 F. 3d 1253). The Agency \n     determined that the Alabama underground injection control \n     (UIC) program for hydraulic fracturing, approved by EPA under \n     section 1425 of the SDWA, complies with Class II well \n     requirements.\n       We are concerned that the Agency's execution of the SDWA, \n     as it applies to hydraulic fracturing, may not be providing \n     adequate public health protection, consistent with the goals \n     of the statute.\n       First, we have questions regarding the information \n     presented in the June 2004 EPA Study and the conclusion to \n     forego national regulations on hydraulic fracturing in favor \n     of an MOU limited to diesel fuel. In the June 2004 EPA Study, \n     EPA identifies the characteristics of the chemicals found in \n     hydraulic fracturing fluids, according to their Material \n     Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs), identifies harmful effects \n     ranging from eye, skin, and respiratory irritation to \n     carcinogenic effects. EPA determines that the presence of \n     these chemicals does not warrant EPA regulation for several \n     reasons. First, EPA states that none of these chemicals, \n     other than BTEX compounds, are already regulated under the \n     SDWA or are on the Agency's draft Contaminant Candidate List \n     (CCL). Second, the Agency states that it does not believe \n     that these chemicals are present in hydraulic fracturing \n     fluids used for coalbed methane, and third, that if they are \n     used, they are not introduced in sufficient concentrations to \n     cause harm. These conclusions raise several questions:\n       1. The data presented in the June 2004 EPA study identifies \n     potential harmful effects from the chemicals listed by the \n     Agency in this report. Has the Agency or does the Agency plan \n     to incorporate the results of this study and the fact that \n     these chemicals are present in hydraulic fracturing agents \n     into the CCL development process, and if not, why not?\n       2. In the June 2004 EPA study, the Agency concludes that \n     hydraulic fracturing fluids do not contain most of the \n     chemicals identified. This conclusion is based on two items--\n     ``conversations with field engineers'' and ``witnessing three \n     separate fracturing events'' (June 2004 EPA Study, p. 4-17.)\n       a. How did the Agency select particular field engineers \n     with whom to converse on this subject?\n       b. Please provide a transcript of the conversations with \n     field engineers, including the companies or consulting firms \n     with which they were affiliated.\n       c. How did the Agency select the three separate fracturing \n     events to witness?\n       d. Were those events representative of the different site-\n     specific characteristics referenced in the June 2004 study \n     (June 2004 EPA Study, p. 4-19) as determining factors in the \n     types of hydraulic fracturing fluids that will be used?\n       e. Which companies were observed?\n       f. Was prior notice given of the planned witnessing of \n     these events?\n       g. What percentage of the annual number of hydraulic \n     fracturing events that occur in the United States does ``3'' \n     represent?\n       h. Finally, please explain why the Material Safety Data \n     Sheets for the fluids identified as potentially being used in \n     hydraulic fracturing list component chemicals that the EPA \n     does not believe are present.\n       The Agency concludes in the June 2004 study that even if \n     these chemicals are present, they are not present in \n     sufficient concentrations to cause harm. The Agency bases \n     this conclusion on assumed flowback, dilution and \n     dispersion, adsorption and entrapment, and biodegradation. \n     The June 2004 study repeatedly cites the 1991 Palmer \n     study, ``Comparison between gel-fracture and water-\n     fracture stimulations in the Black Warrior basin; \n     Proceedings 1991 Coalbed Methane Symposium,'' which found \n     that only 61 percent of the fluid injected during \n     hydraulic fracturing is recovered. Please explain what \n     data EPA collected and what observations the Agency made \n     in the field that would support the conclusion that the 39 \n     percent of fluids remaining in the ground are not present \n     in sufficient concentrations to adversely affect \n     underground sources of drinking water.\n       After identifying BTEX compounds as the major constituent \n     of concern (June 2004 EPA study, page 4-15), the Agency \n     entered into the MOU described above as its mechanism to \n     eliminate diesel fuel from hydraulic fracturing fluids.\n       3. a. How does the Agency plan to enforce the provisions in \n     the MOU and ensure that its terms are met?\n       b. For example, will the Agency conduct independent \n     monitoring of hydraulic fracturing processes in the field to \n     ensure that diesel fuel is not used?\n       c. Will the Agency require states to monitor for diesel use \n     as part of their Class II UIC Programs?\n       4. a. Should the Agency become aware of an unreported \n     return to the use of diesel fuel in hydraulic fracturing by \n     one of the parties to the MOU, what recourse is available to \n     EPA under the terms of the MOU?\n       b. What action does the Agency plan to take should such a \n     situation occur?\n        c. Why did EPA choose to use an MOU as opposed to a \n     regulatory approach to achieve the goal of eliminating diesel \n     fuel in hydraulic fracturing?\n       d. What revisions were made to the June 2004 EPA study \n     between the December 2003 adoption of the MOU and the 2004 \n     release of the study? Which of those changes dealt \n     specifically with the use and effects of diesel fuel in \n     hydraulic fracturing?\n       e. The Agency also states that it expects that even if \n     diesel were used, a number of factors would decrease the \n     concentration and availability of BTEX. Please elaborate on \n     the data EPA collected and the observations the Agency made \n     in the field that would support the conclusion that the 39 \n     percent of fluids remaining in the ground (1991 Palmer), \n     should they contain BTEX compounds, would not be present in \n     sufficient concentrations to adversely affect underground \n     sources of drinking water.\n       We are also concerned that the EPA response to the court \n     remand leaves several unanswered questions. The Court \n     decision found that hydraulic fracturing wells ``fit squarely \n     within the definition of Class II wells.'' (LEAF II, 276 F.3d \n     at 1263), and remanded back to EPA to determine if the \n     Alabama underground injection control program under section \n     1425 complies with Class II well requirements. On July 15, \n     2004, EPA published its finding in the Federal Register that \n     the Alabama program complies with the requirements of the \n     1425 Class II well requirements. (69 FR No. 135, pp 42341.) \n     According to EPA, Alabama is the only state that has a \n     program specifically for hydraulic fracturing approved under \n     section 1425. Based on this analysis, it seems that in order \n     to comply with the Court's finding that hydraulic fracturing \n     is a part of the Class II well definition, the remaining \n     states should be using their existing Class II, EPA-approved \n     programs, under 1422 or 1425, to regulate hydraulic \n     fracturing.\n       To date, EPA has approved Underground Injection Control \n     programs in 34 states. Approval dates range from 1981-1996.\n       5. Do you plan to conduct a national survey or review to \n     determine whether state Class II programs adequately regulate \n     hydraulic fracturing?\n       At the time that these programs were approved, the \n     standards against which state Class II programs were \n     evaluated did not include any minimum requirements for \n     hydraulic fracturing. In its January 19, 2000 notice of EPA's \n     approval of Alabama's 1425 program, the Agency stated, ``When \n     the regulations in 40 CFR parts 144 and 146, including the \n     well classifications, were promulgated, it was not EPA's \n     intent to regulate hydraulic fracturing of coal beds. \n     Accordingly, the well classification systems found in 40 CFR \n     144.6 and 146.5 do not expressly include hydraulic fracturing \n     injection activities. Also, the various permitting, \n     construction and other requirements found in Parts 144 and \n     146 do not specifically address hydraulic fracturing.'' (65 \n     FR No. 12, p. 2892.)\n       Further, EPA acknowledges that there can be significant \n     differences between hydraulic fracturing and standard \n     activities addressed by state Class II programs. In the \n     January 19, 2000 Federal Register notice, the Agency states: \n     . . . since the injection of fracture fluids through these \n     wells is often a one-time exercise of extremely limited \n     duration (fracture injections generally last no more than two \n     hours) ancillary to the well's principal function of \n     producing methane, it did not seem entirely appropriate to \n     ascribe Class II status to such wells, for all regulatory \n     purposes, merely due to the fact that, prior to commencing \n     production, they had been fractured.'' (65 FR No. 12, p. \n     2892.)\n       Although hydraulic fracturing falls under the Class II \n     definition, the Agency has acknowledged that hydraulic \n     fracturing is different than most of the activities that \n     occur under Class II and that there are no national \n     regulations or standards on how to regulate hydraulic \n     fracturing.\n       6. In light of the Court decision and the Agency's July \n     2004 response to the Court remand, did the Agency consider \n     establishing national regulations or standards for hydraulic \n     fracturing or minimum requirements for hydraulic fracturing \n     regulations under state Class II programs?\n\n[[Page S5535]]\n\n       7. a. If so, please provide a detailed description of your \n     consideration of establishing these regulations or standards \n     and the rationale for not pursuing them.\n       b. Do you plan to establish such regulations or standards \n     in the future?\n       c. If not, what standards will be used as the standard of \n     measurement for compliance for hydraulic fracturing under \n     state Class II programs?\n       We appreciate your timely response to these questions in \n     reaction to the three recent actions taken by the EPA in \n     relation to hydraulic fracturing--the adoption of the MOU, \n     the release of the final study, and the response to the Court \n     remand. Clean and safe drinking water is one of our nation's \n     greatest assets, and we believe we must do all we can to \n     continue to protect public health. Thank you again for your \n     response.\n           Sincerely,\n     Jim Jeffords.\n     Barbara Boxer.\n                                  ____\n\n                                       United States Environmental\n\n\n                                            Protection Agency,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, December 7, 2004.\n     Hon. Jim Jeffords,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Jeffords: Thank you for your letter to \n     Administrator Michael Leavitt, dated October 14, 2004, \n     concerning the recent actions that the Environmental \n     Protection Agency (EPA) has taken in implementing the \n     Underground Injection Control (UIC) program with respect to \n     hydraulic fracturing associated with coalbed methane wells.\n       The Office of Ground Water and Drinking Water (OGWDW) has \n     prepared specific responses to your technical and policy \n     questions regarding how we conducted the hydraulic fracturing \n     study, the reasons behind our decisions pertaining to the \n     recommendations contained in the study, and any plans or \n     thoughts we may have on the likelihood for future \n     investigation, regulation, or guidance concerning such \n     hydraulic fracturing.\n       Since the inception of the UIC program, EPA has implemented \n     the program to ensure that public health is protected by \n     preventing endangerment of underground sources of drinking \n     water (USDWs). The Agency has placed a priority on \n     understanding the risks posed by different types of UIC \n     wells, and worked to ensure that appropriate regulatory \n     actions are taken where specific types of wells may pose a \n     significant risk to drinking water sources. In 1999, in \n     response to concerns raised by Congress and other \n     stakeholders about issues associated with the practice of \n     hydraulic fracturing of coalbed methane wells in the State of \n     Alabama, EPA initiated a study to better understand the \n     impacts of the practice.\n       EPA worked to ensure that its study, which was focused on \n     evaluating the potential threat posed to USDWs by fluids used \n     to hydraulically fracture coalbed methane wells, was carried \n     out in a transparent fashion. The Agency provided many \n     opportunities to all stakeholders and the general public to \n     review and comment on the Agency study design and the draft \n     study. The study design was made available for public comment \n     in July 2000, a public meeting was held in August 2000, \n     public notice of the final study design was provided in the \n     Federal Register in September 2000, and the draft study was \n     noticed in the Federal Register in August 2002. The draft \n     report was also distributed to all interested parties and \n     posted on the internet. The Agency received more than 100 \n     comments from individuals and other entities.\n       EPA's final June 2004 study, Evaluation of Impacts to \n     Underground Sources of Drinking Water by Hydraulic Fracturing \n     of Coalbed Methane Reservoirs, is the most comprehensive \n     review of the subject matter to date. The Agency did not \n     recommend additional study at this time due to the study's \n     conclusion that the potential threat to USDWs posed by \n     hydraulic fracturing of coalbed methane wells is low. \n     However, the Administrator retains the authority under the \n     Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) section 1431 to take \n     appropriate action to address any imminent and substantial \n     endangerment to public health caused by hydraulic fracturing.\n       During the course of the study, EPA could not identify any \n     confirmed cases where drinking water was contaminated by \n     hydraulic fracturing fluids associated with coalbed methane \n     production. We did uncover a potential threat to USDWs \n     through the use of diesel fuel as a constituent of fracturing \n     fluids where coalbeds are co-located with a USDW. We reduced \n     that risk by signing and implementing the December 2003 \n     Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with three major service \n     companies that carry out the bulk of coalbed methane \n     hydraulic fracturing activities throughout the country. This \n     past summer we confirmed that the companies are carrying out \n     the MOA and view the completion of this agreement as a \n     success story in protecting USDWs.\n       In your letter, you asked about the Agency's actions with \n     respect to hydraulic fracturing in light of LEAF v. EPA. In \n     this case, the Eleventh Circuit held that the hydraulic \n     fracturing of coalbed seams in Alabama to produce methane gas \n     was ``underground injection'' for purposes of the SDWA and \n     EPA's UIC program. Following that decision, Alabama \n     developed--and EPA approved--a revised UIC program to protect \n     USDWs during the hydraulic fracturing of coalbeds. The \n     Eleventh Circuit ultimately affirmed EPA's approval of \n     Alabama's revised UIC program.\n       In administering the UIC program, the Agency believes it is \n     sound policy to focus its attention on addressing those wells \n     that pose the greatest risk to USDWs. Since 1999, our focus \n     has been on reducing risk from shallow Class V injection \n     wells. EPA estimates that there are more than 500,000 of \n     these wells throughout the country. The wastes injected into \n     them include, in part, storm water runoff, agricultural \n     effluent, and untreated sanitary wastes. The Agency and \n     States are increasing actions to address these wells in order \n     to make the best use of existing resources.\n       EPA remains committed to ensuring that drinking water is \n     protected. I look forward to working with Congress to respond \n     to any additional questions, or the concerns that Members of \n     Congress or their constituents may have. If you have further \n     comments or questions, please contact me, or your staff may \n     contact Steven Kinberg of the Office of Congressional and \n     Intergovernmental Relations at (202) 564-5037.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Benjamin H. Grumbles,\n     Acting Assistant Administrator.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n   EPA Response to Specific Questions Regarding Hydraulic Fracturing\n\n       1. The data presented in the June 2004 EPA study identifies \n     potential harmful effects from the chemicals listed by the \n     Agency in this report. Has the Agency or does the Agency plan \n     to incorporate the results of this study and the fact that \n     these chemicals are present in hydraulic fracturing agents \n     into the Contaminant Candidate List (CCL) development \n     process, and if not, why not?\n       Although the EPA CBM study found that certain chemical \n     constituents could be found in some hydraulic fracturing \n     fluids, EPA cannot state categorically that they are \n     contained in all such fluids. Each fracturing procedure may \n     be site specific or basin specific and fluids used may depend \n     on the site geology, the stratigraphy, (i.e., type of coal \n     formation), depth of the formation, and the number of coal \n     beds for each fracture operation. The Agency's study did not \n     develop new information related to potential health effects \n     from these chemicals; it merely reported those potential \n     health effects indicated on the Material Safety Data Sheet \n     (MSDS) or other information we obtained from the service \n     companies.\n       As noted in the final report, ``Contaminants on the CCL are \n     known or anticipated to occur in public water systems . . .'' \n     The extent to which the contaminants identified in fracturing \n     fluids are part of the next CCL process will depend upon \n     whether they meet this test.\n       2. In the June 2004 EPA study, the Agency concludes that \n     hydraulic fracturing fluids do not contain most of the \n     chemicals identified. This conclusion is based on two items--\n     ``conversations with field engineers'' and ``witnessing three \n     separate fracturing events''.\n       a. How did the agency select particular field engineers \n     with whom to converse on this subject?\n       The Agency did not ``select'' any of the engineers; we \n     talked with the engineers who happened to be present at the \n     field operations. In general those were engineers from the \n     coalbed methane companies and the service companies who \n     conducted the actual hydraulic fracturing. When we scheduled \n     to witness the events, we usually conversed with the \n     production company engineer to arrange the logistics and only \n     spoke with the field engineers from the service companies at \n     the well site.\n       b. Please provide a transcript of the conversations with \n     field engineers, including the companies or consulting firms \n     with which they were affiliated.\n       EPA did not prepare a word-for-word transcript of \n     conversations with engineers.\n       c. How did the Agency select the three separate fracturing \n     events to witness?\n       The events selected were dependent on the location of the \n     fracturing events, the schedules of both EPA OGWDW staff and \n     EPA Regional staff to witness the event, and the preparation \n     time to procure funding and authorization for travel EPA \n     witnessed the 3 events because the planning and scheduling of \n     these happened to work for all parties. In one event, only \n     EPA HQ staff witnessed the procedure, in another event only \n     EPA Regional staff witnessed it, and in one event, both EPA \n     HQ and Regional staff attended with DOE staff.\n       d. Were those events representative of the different site-\n     specific characteristics referenced in the June 2004 study \n     (p. 4-19)'' as determining factors in the types of hydraulic \n     fracturing fluids that will be used?\n       Budget limitations precluded visits to each of the 11 \n     different major coal basins in the U.S. It would have proven \n     to be an expensive and time-consuming process to witness \n     operations in each of these regions. Additionally, even \n     within the same coal basin there are potentially many \n     different types of well configurations, each of which could \n     affect the fracturing plan. EPA believed that witnessing \n     events in 3 very different coal basin settings--Colorado, \n     Kansas, and south western Virginia--would give us an \n     understanding of the practice as conducted in different \n     regions of the country.\n       e. Which companies were observed?\n       EPA observed a Schlumberger hydraulic fracturing operation \n     in the San Juan basin of Colorado, and Halliburton hydraulic \n     fracturing operations in southwest Virginia and Kansas.\n       f. Was prior notice given of the planned witnessing of \n     these events?\n\n[[Page S5536]]\n\n       Yes, because it would have been very difficult to witness \n     the events had they not been planned. To plan the visit, EPA \n     needed to have prior knowledge of the drilling operation, the \n     schedule of the drilling, and the scheduling of the services \n     provided by the hydraulic fracturing service company. Wells, \n     in general, take days to drill (in some cases weeks and \n     months depending on depth of the well) and the fracturing may \n     take place at a later date depending on the availability of \n     the service company and other factors beyond anyone's \n     control.\n       g. What percentage of the annual number of hydraulic \n     fracturing events that occur in the United States does ``3'' \n     represent?\n       Because of a limited project budget, EPA did not attempt to \n     attend a representative number of hydraulic fracturing \n     events; that would have been beyond the scope of this Phase I \n     investigation. The primary purpose of the site visits was to \n     provide EPA personnel familiarity with the hydraulic \n     fracturing process as applied to coalbed methane wells. The \n     visits served to give EPA staff a working-level, field \n     experience on exactly how well-site operations are conducted, \n     how the process takes place, the logistics in setting up the \n     operation, and the monitoring and verification conducted by \n     the service companies to assure that the fracturing job was \n     accomplished effectively and safely. EPA understands that \n     thousands of fracturing events take place annually, for both \n     conventional oil and gas operations and coalbed methane \n     production, and that three events represent an extremely \n     small fraction of that total.\n       h. Finally, please explain why the Material Safety Data \n     Sheets for the fluids identified as potentially being used in \n     hydraulic fracturing list component chemicals that the EPA \n     does not believe are present.\n       In Table 4-1 of the final study, EPA identified the range \n     of fluids and fluid additives commonly used in hydraulic \n     fracturing. Some of the fluids and fluid additives may \n     contain constituents of potential concern, however, it is \n     important to note that the information presented in the MSDS \n     is for the pure product. Each of the products listed in Table \n     4-1 is significantly diluted prior to injection. The MSDS \n     information we obtained is not site specific. We reviewed a \n     number of data sheets and we noted that many of them are \n     different, contain different lists of fluids and additives, \n     and thus we concluded in the final report that we cannot say \n     whether one specific chemical, or chemicals, is/are present \n     at every hydraulic fracturing operation.\n       3. a. How does the Agency plan to enforce the provisions in \n     the MOU and ensure that its terms are met?\n       There is no mechanism to ``enforce'' a voluntary agreement \n     such as the MOA signed by EPA and the three major service \n     companies. The MOA was signed in good faith by senior \n     managers from the three service companies and the Assistant \n     Administrator for Water, and EPA expects it will be carried \n     out. EPA has written all signers of the MOA and asked if they \n     have implemented the agreement and how will they ensure that \n     diesel fuel is not being used in USDWs. All three have \n     written back to EPA, stating that they have removed diesel \n     from their CBM fracturing fluids when a USDW is involved and \n     intend to implement a plan to ensure that such procedures are \n     met. EPA intends to follow up with the service companies on \n     progress in implementing such plans.\n       b. For example, will the Agency conduct independent \n     monitoring of hydraulic fracturing processes in the field to \n     ensure that diesel fuel is not used?\n       It is unlikely that EPA will conduct such field monitoring. \n     First, in most oil and gas producing states, and coalbed \n     methane producing states, the State Oil and Gas Agency \n     generally has UIC primary enforcement responsibility, and the \n     state inspectors are the primary field presence for such \n     operations. Second, EPA has a very limited field staff and in \n     most cases they are engaged in carrying out responsibilities \n     related to Class I, III and V wells in states in which they \n     directly implement the UIC program. EPA plans to work with \n     several organizations, including the Ground Water Protection \n     Council and the Independent Petroleum Association of America \n     to determine if there are other smaller companies conducting \n     CBM hydraulic fracturing with diesel fuel as a constituent \n     and will explore the possibility of including them in the \n     MOA.\n       c. Will the Agency require states to monitor for diesel use \n     as part of their Class II programs?\n       Given limited funds for basic national and state UIC \n     program requirements, EPA does not have plans to include the \n     states as parties to the MOA or require them to monitor for \n     diesel fuel in hydraulic fracturing fields. The State of \n     Alabama's EPA-approved UIC program prohibits the hydraulic \n     fracturing of coalbeds in a manner that allows the movement \n     of contaminants into USDWs at levels exceeding the drinking \n     water MCLs or that may adversely affect the health of \n     persons. Current federal regulations do not expressly address \n     or prohibit the use of diesel fuel in fracturing fluids, but \n     the SDWA and UIC regulations allow States to be more \n     stringent than the federal UIC program.\n       4. a. Should the Agency become aware of an unreported \n     return to the use of diesel fuel in hydraulic fracturing by \n     one of the parties to the MOD, what recourse is available to \n     EPA under the terms of the MOD?\n       There are no terms in the MOA that would provide EPA a \n     mechanism to take any enforcement action should the Agency \n     become aware of an unreported return to the use of diesel \n     fuel in hydraulic fracturing by one of the parties to the \n     MOA. However, EPA would work closely with the companies to \n     determine why such action occurred and discuss possible \n     termination procedures. The agreement defines how either \n     party can terminate the agreement. EPA would make every \n     effort to work with such a company to maintain their \n     participation in the agreement. EPA entered the agreement \n     with an assumption that the companies would honor the \n     commitments they have made about diesel use in hydraulic \n     fracturing fluids.\n       b. What action does the Agency plan to take should such a \n     situation occur?\n       If such a situation does happen, and EPA learns that diesel \n     fuel used in hydraulic fracturing fluid may enter a USDW and \n     may present an imminent and substantial threat to public \n     health, EPA may issue orders or initiate litigation as \n     necessary pursuant to SDWA section 1431 to protect public \n     health. Otherwise, EPA would take the actions described under \n     the previous question.\n       c. Why did EPA choose to use an MOU as opposed to a \n     regulatory approach to achieve the goal of eliminating diesel \n     fuel in hydraulic fracturing?\n       While the report's findings did not point to a significant \n     threat from diesel fuel in hydraulic fracturing fluids, the \n     Agency believed that a precautionary approach was \n     appropriate. EPA chose to work collaboratively with the oil \n     service companies because we thought that such an approach \n     would work quicker, and be more effective than other \n     approaches the Agency might employ (i.e. rulemaking, \n     enforcement orders, etc.). We believed that once the service \n     companies became familiar with the issue, they would \n     willingly address EPA's concerns. After several months of \n     meetings and negotiations between representatives of the \n     service companies and high level management in EPA's Office \n     of Water, a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) was drafted and \n     signed by all parties effective December 24, 2003.\n       We believe that the MOA mechanism accomplished the intended \n     goal of removing diesel from hydraulic fracturing fluids in a \n     matter of months, whereas proposing a rule to require removal \n     would have taken at least a year or more.\n       d. What revisions were made to the June 2004 EPA study \n     between the December 2003 adoption of the MOD and the 2004 \n     release of the study? Which of those changes dealt \n     specifically with the use and effects of diesel fuel in \n     hydraulic fracturing?\n       During the specified time-frame, EPA focused on making \n     editorial changes to the report and clarifying information \n     relative to its qualitative discussion of the mitigating \n     effects of dilution, dispersion, adsorption, and \n     biodegradation of residual fluids. With respect to the use \n     and effects of diesel fuel, changes in the study primarily \n     focused on including language in the text of the report which \n     acknowledged that we had successfully negotiated an MOA with \n     the service companies. Specifically. EPA referenced this \n     agreement in the text of the report in the Executive Summary \n     at page ES-2 and on page BS-17 and further discussed the MOA \n     in Chapter 7 in the Conclusions Section of the study.\n       e. The Agency also states that it expects that even if \n     diesel were used a number of factors would decrease the \n     concentration and availability of BTEX. Please elaborate on \n     the data EPA collected and the observations the Agency made \n     in the field that would support the conclusion that 39% of \n     fluids remaining in the ground (1991 Palmer), should they \n     contain BTEX compounds would not be present in sufficient \n     concentrations to adversely affect underground sources of \n     drinking water.\n       EPA reiterates that the 39% figure from the 1991 Palmer \n     paper is only one instance where it has been documented what \n     quantity of the hydraulic fracturing fluids injected into \n     wells will remain behind. Dr. Palmer, who conducted the \n     original research, estimated that coalbed methane production \n     wells flow back a greater percentage of fracturing fluids \n     injected during the process. Where formations are dewatered \n     or produced for a substantial period of time, greater \n     quantities of formation and fracturing fluids would \n     presumably be removed. We used 39% remaining fluids as a \n     ``worst case'' scenario while doing our qualitative \n     assessment, since it was the only figure we had from research \n     conducted on coalbed methane wells.\n       With respect to the BTEX compounds, we no longer believe \n     that they are a concern owing to the MOA negotiated between \n     EPA and the three major service companies.\n       5. Do you plan to conduct a national surveyor survey or \n     review to determine whether state Class II programs \n     adequately regulate hydraulic fracturing?\n       At this time, EPA has no plans to conduct such a survey or \n     review regarding the adequacy of Class II programs in \n     regulating hydraulic fracturing. In its final study design, \n     EPA indicated that it would not begin to evaluate existing \n     state regulations concerning hydraulic fracturing until it \n     decided to do a Phase III investigation. The Agency, however, \n     reserves the right to change its position on this if news \n     information warrants such a change.\n       6. In light of the Court decision and the Agency's July \n     2004 response to the Court remand, did the Agency consider \n     establishing national regulations or standards for hydraulic \n     fracturing or minimum requirements for hydraulic fracturing \n     regulations under Class II programs?\n\n[[Page S5537]]\n\n       When State UIC programs were approved by the Agency--\n     primarily during the early 1980s--there was no Eleventh \n     Circuit Court decision indicating that hydraulic fracturing \n     was within the definition of ``underground injection.'' Prior \n     to LEAF v. EPA, EPA had never interpreted the SDWA to cover \n     production practices, such as hydraulic fracturing. After the \n     Court decision in 1997, the Agency began discussions with the \n     State of Alabama on revising their UIC program to include \n     hydraulic fracturing. The net result of that process was the \n     EPA approval of Alabama's revised section 1425 SDWA UIC \n     program to include specific regulations addressing CBM \n     hydraulic fracturing. This approval was signed by the \n     Administrator in December 1999, and published in the Federal \n     Register in January 2000.\n       In light of the Phase I HF study and our conclusion that \n     hydraulic fracturing did not present a significant public \n     health risk, we see no reason at this time to pursue a \n     national hydraulic fracturing regulation to protect USDWs or \n     the public health. It is also relevant that the three major \n     service companies have entered into an agreement with EPA to \n     voluntarily remove diesel fuel from their fracturing fluids.\n       7. a. If so, please provide a detailed description of your \n     consideration of establishing these regulations or standards \n     and the rationale for not pursuing them. b. Do you plan to \n     establish such regulations or standards in the future? c. If \n     not, what standards will be used as the standard of \n     measurement for compliance for hydraulic fracturing under \n     state Class II programs?\n       EPA has not explored in any detailed fashion minimum \n     national or state requirements for hydraulic fracturing of \n     CBM wells, except when it evaluated the revised UIC program \n     in Alabama.\n       Considering and developing national regulations for \n     hydraulic fracturing would involve discussions with numerous \n     stakeholders, the states, and the public and it would require \n     an intensive effort to arrive at regulatory language that \n     could be applied nationwide. As EPA's study indicates, \n     coalbeds are located in very distinct geologic settings and \n     the manner in which they are produced for methane gas may be \n     very different in each locale. The proximity of USDWs to the \n     coal formations, and the regional geology and hydrology all \n     play roles in how hydraulic fracturing operations are \n     conducted.\n       If EPA receives information of drinking water contamination \n     incidents and follow-up investigations point to a problem, \n     EPA would then re-evaluate its decision to not continue with \n     additional study relating to CBM hydraulic fracturing.\n       Should additional states submit revised UIA programs for \n     EPA's review and approval which include hydraulic fracturing \n     regulations, we would evaluate these programs under the \n     effectiveness standards of the SDWA section 1425 as we did \n     for the State of Alabama.\n\n                                S. 1080\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for a minimum update for physicians' services for 2006 and \n2007; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Preserving \nPatient Access to Physicians Act of 2005. This bill updates Medicare \nphysician reimbursement for 2006 and 2007 according to the \nrecommendations of the Medicare Payment Advisory Committee (MedPAC). \nThere would be a 2.7 percent increase to the physician payment schedule \nfor 2006 and using the Medicare Economic Index update for the price of \ninputs, a 2.6 percent increase in 2007.\n  If the schedule is left alone, the consequences for physicians will \nbe a negative. Instead of the 1.5 percent payment increase for 2004 and \n2005 which I helped author in the Medicare Modernization Act, there \nwould be a 4.3 percent decrease.\n  The sustainable growth rate (SGR) formula used to calculate physician \npayment depends on a number of factors: the number of Medicare fee-for-\nservice beneficiaries, the volume and type of services provided, the \nprice of services rendered, changes in regulations and laws. The \nformula also incorporates other factors such as prescription-drug \nprices and the gross domestic product. The SGR was intended to control \nexpenditures by basing a given year's physician payment rate on the \nprevious year's performance. Instead, it creates an arbitrary \ndeficiency that continues to force Congress to intervene.\n  There is a debate going on, her CMS has the authority to alter the \nSGR formula by removing drugs. Setting that aside, though, the fact of \nthe matter is that without Congress stepping in to provide for a \nphysician payment update, it probably will not occur. My Senate \ncolleagues and I have talked for many years about ensuring adequate \nphysician payment because current and past administrations have failed \nto modify the formula. This formula is not doing what it was intended \nto do. Therefore, I believe we need to scrap it and start again. My \nbill is a starting point and proposes amounts for an update, but I \nwould really like to see us go all the way back to the drawing board \nand answer the fundamental question of how to pay physicians \nappropriately for their services.\n  I want doctors to be able to continue to assist our nation's seniors, \nbut it is unfair to expect them to practice and to have their \nreimbursement decrease. Practice expenses, the costs of medical \ntechnology, wages for administrative and clinical staff, and medical \nliability premiums are all increasing while physicians are on track to \nreceive a payment decrease. They cannot afford to continue practicing \nmedicine while receiving reimbursements that do not allow them to even \nbreak even. Many are retiring early or threatening to limit the number \nof Medicare patients they treat.\n  The service of physicians all across the country is vital to our \nseniors. Almost half a million doctors provide treatment to the 42 \nmillion people under the Medicare program. Physicians are often the \ngateway for access to other medical services and treatments. Not being \nable to consult a physician results in delayed referrals, delayed \ntreatment and delayed care. In sum, the quality of health care \ncontinues to erode and our system does not operate efficiently.\n  Should the scheduled physician reimbursement cuts take effect, the \nresult will be a $710 million decrease in payments to doctors in \nArizona over 2006 through 2010. I have heard from virtually every \nphysician with whom I have spoken about the constraints that inadequate \npayments are placing on their practice of medicine. While many work for \nhospitals and health systems, in the rural areas, a large number are \nsolo practitioners or in small practices. For these physicians, poor \npayment hits their practice especially hard.\n  If Medicare rates for doctors are inadequate, many other health care \npayors will also lack for adequate reimbursement. Other payors such as \nMedicaid and private insurers often base their payments on Medicare \nrates. While this bill only addresses Medicare physician payment, the \nproblem of access to services will be compounded if physicians receive \nreimbursement from other payors that is below the appropriate levels.\n  The cost of addressing the physician payment update is not cheap. \nEstimates on the cost of this bill are between $25 billion to $35 \nbillion over five years. I await an official score from the \nCongressional Budget Office. But I point out, that doing nothing to \nsolve this problem may cost us more: more money, more health and access \nproblems, and more physicians leaving the profession. Although this \nlegislation provides for a two year update, we must develop a long \nrange mechanism to pay physicians appropriately.\n  I am grateful for the support of this legislation by my colleague, \nSenator\n\n[[Page S5538]]\n\nStabenow of Michigan, and encourage my other colleagues to support the \nPreserving Patient Access to Physicians Act of 2005.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 American Medical Association,\n\n                                        Chicago, IL, May 19, 2005.\n     Hon. John Kyl,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kyl: On behalf of the American Medical \n     Association (AMA), we offer our strong support of your \n     legislation, entitled the Preserving Patient Access to \n     Physicians Act of 2005. We thank you for your leadership in \n     introducing this legislation and providing a remedy to the \n     steep Medicare physician payment cuts that are expected, \n     beginning January 1, 2006.\n       The Medicare Trustees have recently predicted that Medicare \n     payments for physicians' services will be cut by about 26 \n     percent from 2006 through 2011. These cuts will critically \n     impact access to medical services for our Nation's senior and \n     disabled patients. A recent AMA survey concerning physician \n     responses to significant Medicare physician pay cuts \n     beginning January 1, 2006 indicates that if these cuts begin \n     in 2006: 38 percent of physicians plan to decrease the number \n     of new Medicare patients they accept; more than half of \n     physicians plan to defer the purchase of information \n     technology; and a majority of physicians will be less likely \n     to participate in Medicare Advantage.\n       The expected cuts result from the inherently flawed payment \n     update formula, the sustainable growth rate (SGR) spending \n     target. The SGR is linked to the gross domestic product and \n     penalizes physicians and other practitioners for volume \n     increases that they cannot control and that the government \n     actively promotes through new coverage decisions and other \n     initiatives that, while beneficial to patients, are not \n     reflected in the SGR.\n       The AMA applauds your leadership in addressing these cuts \n     and introducing legislation that protects access to needed \n     medical care. Your bill would provide a positive physician \n     payment update of not less than 2.7 percent in 2006 and an \n     update in 2007 that reflects physician practice cost \n     inflation, which, at this time, is expected to be about 2.6 \n     percent.\n       Your bill is critical for ensuring continued and long-term \n     access to health care services for Medicare beneficiaries. We \n     look forward to continuing to work with you to achieve \n     enactment of your legislation, as well as long-term reform of \n     the update formula.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Michael D. Maves,\n                                    Executive Vice President, CEO.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I am very pleased to introduce the \n``Preserving Patient Access to Physicians Act'' with my friend and \ncolleague from Arizona, Senator Kyl. This legislation is critical to \nensuring that our Nation's 42 million Medicare beneficiaries continue \nto have access to high quality physician care.\n  The Medicare program is one of the most successful Federal programs \nof all time. It has lifted countless seniors out of poverty, and it has \nensured access to necessary, affordable, quality medical care for our \nmost vulnerable citizens for the last 40 years.\n  However, that success is threatened because the Medicare physician \npayment formula is fundamentally flawed. At a time when the doctors who \ntreat our seniors are facing increasing practice costs, they are \nlooking at a payment cut of 4.3 percent in 2006 for the Medicare \nservices they provide that simply doesn't make sense.\n  And the cuts don't stop in 2006: if Congress doesn't act, physicians \nwill be hit with devastating cuts totaling 22 percent over the next 5 \nyears. Those cuts represent over $44 billion dollars nationwide, and a \nstaggering $126 billion over the next 10 years.\n  Currently, over 20,000 MDs and DOs in Michigan treat over 1.4 million \nMedicare-eligible Michiganians with very high quality care. But if the \ndoctors in my State receive their scheduled cut of $109 million next \nyear, and over $5 billion over the next ten years, it's not hard to \nimagine that they may be forced to limit the number of Medicare \npatients they serve.\n  Numbers in the billions are indeed staggering--but the critical need \nfor this legislation is even better demonstrated by getting down to the \nspecifics: a Detroit physician currently is reimbursed $56.88 for an \noffice visit. But while we all know medical inflation will continue to \nincrease, under current law, that same physician will receive only \n$41.86 in 2011 for that same visit. And while an orthopedic surgeon in \nDetroit is now reimbursed $1,813.10 for performing a knee \narthroplasty--a knee repair necessary to ensure full mobility--she is \nscheduled to receive $478.66 less for performing that same procedure in \n2011! The examples go on and on: a cardiologist inserting a stent in a \nMedicare patient to prevent heart problems receives $873.85 today. The \nsame surgeon inserting a stent in 2011 will be reimbursed only $643.15.\n  The ``Preserving Patient Access to Physicians Act of 2005'' provides \nphysicians with a minimum update in 2006 and 2007. Specifically, the \nlegislation overrides the Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) formula in \nthese years: the update to the single conversion factor in 2006 would \nbe 2.7 percent, and a formula based on input prices and a productivity \nadjustment is used for 2007--the likely update for 2007 will be 2.6 \npercent.\n  Kevin Kelly, Executive Director of the Michigan State Medical \nSociety, tells me that the minimum updates provided in this legislation \nare essential to both physicians and patients in Michigan in terms of \nassuring access to Medicare services.\n  And Robert Stomel, D.O., President of the Michigan Osteopathic \nAssociation, said that introduction of this legislation ``is an \nimportant step in efforts to protect the availability and access to \nphysician services for millions of Medicare beneficiaries.'' Dr. Stomel \nwent on to say, ``This bipartisan legislation represents a continued \nrecognition that physician payment under Medicare must keep pace with \nthe increasing cost of providing care.''\n  Yet I know that this is just the beginning. We cannot continue to use \nstop-gap measures but must replace the SGR with a payment system that \nactually makes sense and reflects the costs of providing physician care \nto Medicare beneficiaries.\n  Through the bipartisan partnership Senator Kyl and I have begun \ntoday, we can--and must--fix the physician payment formula and continue \nto provide access to high-quality Medicare services for all of our \nseniors and people with disabilities.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record letters of \nsupport from the American Medical Association and the American \nOsteopathic Association.\n  I urge my Colleagues to join us in this effort, and I thank the \nChair.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                 American Medical Association,\n\n                                        Chicago, IL, May 19, 2005.\n     Hon. Debbie A. Stabenow,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Stabenow: On behalf of the American Medical \n     Association (AMA), we offer our strong support of your \n     legislation, entitled the Preserving Patient Access to \n     Physicians Act of 2005. We thank you for your leadership in \n     introducing this legislation and providing a remedy to the \n     steep Medicare physician payment cuts that are expected, \n     beginning January 1, 2006.\n       The Medicare Trustees have recently predicted that Medicare \n     payments for physicians' services will be cut by about 26% \n     from 2006 through 2011. These cuts will critically impact \n     access to medical services for our nation's senior and \n     disabled patients. A recent AMA survey concerning physician \n     responses to significant Medicare physician pay cuts \n     beginning January 1, 2006 indicates that if these cuts begin \n     in 2006: 38% of physicians plan to decrease the number of new \n     Medicare patients they accept; more than half of physicians \n     plan to defer the purchase of information technology; and a \n     majority of physicians will be less likely to participate in \n     Medicare Advantage.\n       The expected cuts result from the inherently flawed payment \n     update formula, the sustainable growth rate (SGR) spending \n     target. The SGR is linked to the gross domestic product and \n     penalizes physicians and other practitioners for volume \n     increases that they cannot control and that the government \n     actively promotes through new coverage decisions and other \n     initiatives that, while beneficial to patients, are not \n     reflected in the SGR.\n       The AMA applauds your leadership in addressing these cuts \n     and introducing legislation that protects access to needed \n     medical care. Your bill would provide a positive physician \n     payment update of not less than 2.7% in 2006 and an update in \n     2007 that reflects physician practice cost inflation, which, \n     at this time, is expected to be about 2.6%.\n       Your bill is critical for ensuring continued and long-term \n     access to health care services for Medicare beneficiaries. We \n     look forward to continuing to work with you to achieve \n     enactment of your legislation, as well as long-term reform of \n     the update formula.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Michael D. Maves.\n\n[[Page S5539]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                             American Osteopathic Association,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 19, 2005.\n     Hon. Debbie Stabenow,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Stabenow: As President of the American \n     Osteopathic Association (AOA), I am pleased to inform you of \n     our strong support for the ``Preserving Patient Access to \n     Physicians Act of 2005''. The AOA, which represents the \n     nation's 54,000 osteopathic physicians practicing in 23 \n     specialties and subspecialties, extends its sincere gratitude \n     to you for introducing this bill.\n       The current sustainable growth rate (SGR) formula for \n     physician services under the Medicare program is broken. The \n     continued use of the flawed and unstable methodology will \n     result in a loss of physician services for millions of \n     Medicare beneficiaries. Physicians annually face reductions \n     in payment while their practice costs continue to rise. \n     Congress recognized this with the approval of the ``Medicare \n     Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of \n     2003'' (MMA) (P.L. 108-173) which replaced scheduled \n     physician payment reductions with modest increases of 1.5 \n     percent per year for 2004 and 2005. Unfortunately, physicians \n     now face a projected reduction of 4.3 percent for 2006, with \n     additional reductions for the foreseeable future that could \n     amount to over 30 percent.\n       Your legislation takes an important step to address the \n     projected 2006 and 2007 reductions in physician payment under \n     Medicare. Specifically, the bill would establish a minimum \n     physician payment update of 2.7 percent per year for 2006 and \n     2007. A minimum update of 2.7 percent will help ensure a \n     physician's continued ability to provide quality health care \n     services to Medicare beneficiaries.\n       On behalf of my fellow osteopathic physicians, I pledge our \n     support for your effort to address the flawed Medicare \n     physician payment formula. We look forward to working with \n     you to advance this important legislation. Please do not \n     hesitate to call upon the AOA or our members for assistance \n     on health care issues. Contact the AOA's Department of \n     Government Relations at (202) 414-0140 for additional \n     information.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              George Thomas, D.O.,\n                                                        President.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY:\n  S. 1084. A bill to eliminate child poverty, and for other purposes; \nread the first time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is shameful that in the richest and \nmost powerful Nation on earth, nearly a fifth of all children--nearly \n13 million--live in poverty. That is why I am introducing the End Child \nPoverty Act to address this fundamental moral issue. It will set a \nnational goal to reduce child poverty by half within a decade, and to \neliminate it entirely as soon as possible after that.\n  The effect of child poverty is far reaching. Children in poverty are \noften malnourished. They have weaker immune systems and are more \nvulnerable to infections and illness. Poor children also suffer in \nschool. They lack vital nutrition necessary for healthy brain \ndevelopment. They have trouble concentrating in class. They often \nattend schools that have the least resources. Their families move \nfrequently, so their school attendance is low. Overcrowding, utility \nshutoffs, and poor heating interfere with homework.\n  The End Child Poverty Act would commit the U.S. to ending these \nhorrors of children growing up in such dire conditions. The bill would \nestablish a Child Poverty Elimination Board to make recommendations to \nthe President on how best to meet this commitment to children. It would \noffset the cost with a one percent surtax on income over $1 million to \nbe invested in a Child Poverty Elimination Fund.\n  We must begin with this moral vision, just as we did with America's \nseniors. The elderly were once the poorest in society. But in 1935, we \nmade a commitment that growing old shouldn't mean growing poor. We \nenacted Social Security and later Medicare, and now the elderly in \nAmerica are significantly better off. The End Child Poverty Act is a \nvital step to give comparable security to America's children.\n  It's time for America to make a real commitment, and give real hope, \nreal opportunity and real fairness to children and families mired in \npoverty in communities in all parts of our country.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH:\n  S. 1086. A bill to improve the national program to register and \nmonitor individuals who commit crimes against children or sex offenses; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, we are here today in a battle to save our \nchildren, their families, and the victims, of repeat sex offenders.\n  I am so proud of the real warriors in this battle: the victims and \ntheir family members. One of those warriors is Ed Smart, from my home \nState of Utah, whose daughter Elizabeth was kidnapped from her own \nbedroom by a sexual predator. Ed is joined by Patti Wetterling, Linda \nWalker, and other outstanding advocates of our children, including John \nWalsh of America's Most Wanted, Ernie Allen of the National Center for \nMissing and Exploited Children, and Robbie Calloway of the Boys & Girls \nClub of America in support of this bipartisan legislation we are \nintroducing today along with co-sponsor Senator Biden. We need \nlegislation that will close the gaps in many laws already on the books; \nintegrate and revive the existing laws; and expand covered offenses \nagainst children.\n  The Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act will bring all of \nthe States up to date and enable citizens in every State to inform \nthemselves about predators in their communities. This law will enable \nStates to take public information about sex offenders and make it easy \nfor citizens to access at one, open, web-site.\n  This legislation will put the responsibility on the sex offenders \nthemselves to register with the local authorities. They will be \nrequired to notify those authorities when they move or change jobs. And \nif they don't want to comply with the rules--then they will go to jail!\n  This is common sense--those who break such a sacred trust and intend \nto harm our children, no matter who they are, where they are from, or \nwhere they commit their crime, should have some obligations under this \nlaw to voluntarily make their whereabouts known or subject themselves \nto additional jail time. That's what this bill is about. It's that \nsimple.\n  The victims and victims' families have dealt with the pain and \nanguish imposed on them by these sexual offenders and predators. But \ninstead of lying down, they are standing up for imposing common-sense \nrules on those who have taken the life and liberty of the most innocent \nand defenseless among us. They are standing up for tough sentences \nagainst those who won't abide by these very simple rules. They are \nstanding up to say that together we are stronger.\n  Prior to 1994 just five states required convicted sex offenders to \nregister their address with local law enforcement. Today there are over \n549,000 registered sex offenders in the United States. Unfortunately, \nmost of these receive and serve limited sentences and roam unchecked \nand unknown in our communities. Their crimes are heinous and they have \na high risk of repeating their crimes on innocent children.\n  Under this Act, sex offenders and predators will be required to \nregister in person, versus mailing in a letter. They will be required \nto wear a tracking device while they are on probation for a first-time \noffense--and wear it for life if they choose to repeat their crimes.\n  This Act enables states to offer citizens a searchable, statewide sex \noffender registry that interacts with all other states to provide \nseamless registration and notification across the country.\n  The Sex Offender Notification and Registration Act will strengthen \nand unite cities, communities and states in the effort to stop the \nassault on American children. This bill has a companion bill in the \nHouse, sponsored by Congressman Mark Foley and Congressman Bud Cramer. \nI invite you to join Senator Biden and me as we close the gaping holes \nthat keep our children at risk.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALEXANDER (for himself and Mr. Schumer):\n  S. 1087. A bill to amend section 337 of the Immigration and \nNationality Act to prescribe the oath or affirmation of renunciation \nand allegiance required to be naturalized as a citizen of the United \nStates; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Today I am introducing legislation to address an \nimportant statement on what it means to be a citizen of the United \nStates: the Oath of Allegiance, to which all new citizens swear in \ncourt when they are naturalized.\n  In the last session of Congress, I introduced legislation to enshrine \nthe Oath of Allegiance in law. I was joined in that effort by 34 \ncolleagues, including the Senator from New York, Mr.\n\n[[Page S5540]]\n\nSchumer, as the lead cosponsor. That legislation was introduced, in \npart, in response to reports that the Bureau of Citizenship and \nImmigration Services, or BCIS, an agency of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, may have been planning to change the Oath of Allegiance that \nimmigrants take to become a citizen of this nation. Other Senators and \nI felt the proposed language, as reported in the press, would have \nweakened the Oath.\n  Today, I introduce a bill that puts forward a compromise that I hope \neveryone can support. I am again grateful to be joined in this effort \nby the senior Senator from New York. This bill introduces a modified \nOath of Allegiance that is just as strong as the current one, but that \nuses more modem language.\n  I was surprise to learn that Congress has never voted on the content \nof this Oath. We have left it to Federal regulators. That's not how we \ntreat other symbols of our Nation or other statements on what it means \nto be an American.\n  For example, the American Flag, with its 50 stars--one for each \nState--and 13 stripes for the original colonies, cannot be altered by \nFederal regulation. The only way a star gets added is when Congress \nacts to admit a new state. And we've never changed the 13 stripes since \nthe flag was first adopted in 1777.\n  The Pledge of Alliance, which we repeat each morning in the United \nStates Senate, can't be altered by Federal regulation. The Pledge is a \nstatement of some of the values of the American Creed: ``one nation, \nunder God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.'' What if a \nFederal agency decided we should take out justice, just saying ``with \nliberty for all''? It can't happen: because the Pledge can only be \naltered by Act of Congress, as it last was in 1954 when the phrase \n``under God'' was added.\n  The National Motto ``In God We Trust,'' which appears on all our \ncoins and dollar bills, can't be altered by Federal regulation. It is a \nfundamental statement of the religious character of the American \npeople--even though we don't permit and don't want the establishment of \nstate religion. The Treasury Department can't decide to leave the motto \noff the next dollar bill it prints because the motto was adopted by \nCongress--at first in 1864 to be printed on the 2-cent piece, an later \nas the official National Motto in 1956.\n  Our National Anthem, the Star Spangled Banner, can't be changed by \nFederal regulation. It, too, is a statement of our values, declaring \nour country ``the land of the free and the home of the brave.'' If a \ngovernment agency decided it preferred America the Beautiful, or the \nBattle Hymn of the Republic, or God Bless America, all of which are \ngreat songs, the agency would have to ask Congress to act. Why? Because \nthe Star Spangled Banner was named our National Anthem by law in 1931.\n  Likewise, the Oath of Allegiance should not be altered lightly--by a \ngovernment agency, without public comment, and without approval from \nCongress. Of the five symbols and statements I've described--the Flag, \nthe Anthem, the Pledge, the Motto, and the Oath, only the Oath of \nAllegiance is legally binding on those who take it. New citizens must \ntake it, and they must sign it.\n  On September 11, 2003, when I spoke about my legislation, I said:\n\n       To be clear, I have no objection to others proposing \n     modifications to the Oath of Allegiance that we use today. . \n     . . perhaps ways can be found to make it even stronger.\n       Still, let's make sure any changes have the support of the \n     people as represented by Congress. The Oath of Allegiance is \n     a statement of the commitments required of new citizens. \n     Current citizens, through their elected representatives, \n     ought to have a say as to what those commitments are. That's \n     a lesson in democracy. A legally binding statement on \n     American citizenship ought to reflect American values, \n     including democracy.\n\n  It is in that spirit that I offer this compromise language that \nprescribes an updated but very strong Oath of Allegiance. This is the \nright way to go forward in considering any changes, and, I hope, will \nallow us to finally enshrine this statement of what it means to be an \nAmerican in law.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KYL:\n  S. 1088. A bill to establish streamlined procedures for collateral \nreview of mixed petitions, amendments, and defaulted claims, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Streamlined \nProcedures Act. This legislation will reduce delays in federal courts' \nreview of habeas corpus petitions filed by State prisoners.\n  Currently, many Federal habeas corpus cases require 10, 15, or even \n20 years to complete. These delays burden the courts and deny justice \nto defendants with meritorious claims. They also are deeply unfair to \nvictims of serious, violent crimes. A parent whose child has been \nmurdered, or someone who has been the victim of a violent assault, \ncannot be expected to ``move on'' without knowing how the case against \nthe attacker has been resolved. Endless litigation, and the uncertainty \nthat it brings, is unnecessarily cruel to these victims and their \nfamilies. As President Clinton noted of the 1996 habeas-corpus reforms, \n``it should not take eight or nine years and three trips to the Supreme \nCourt to finalize whether a person in fact was properly convicted or \nnot.'' For the sake of all parties, we should minimize these delays.\n  The 1996 habeas corpus reforms were supposed to prevent delays in \nFederal collateral review. Unfortunately, as the Justice Department \nnoted in testimony before the House Crime Subcommittee in March 2003, \nthere still are ``significant gaps [in the habeas corpus statutes] . . \n. which can result in highly protracted litigation, and some of the \nreforms that Congress did adopt in 1996 have been substantially \nundermined in judicial application.''\n  The Streamlined Procedures Act is designed to fill some of these \ngaps. First, the SPA imposes reasonable but firm time limits on court \nof appeals' review of Federal habeas petitions. It requires a court of \nappeals to decide a habeas appeal within 300 days of the completion of \nbriefing, to rule on a petition for rehearing within 90 days, and to \ndecide a case on rehearing within 120 days before the same panel, or \n180 days before an en banc court.\n  As generous as these time limits are, they would make a real \ndifference in some cases. In Morales v. Woodford, 336 F.3d 1136, 9th \nCir. 2003, for example, the Ninth Circuit took 3 years to decide the \ncase after briefing was completed. And after issuing its decision, the \ncourt took another 16 months to reject a petition for rehearing. \nSimilarly, in Williams v. Woodford, 306 F.3d 665, 9th Cir. 2002, the \ncourt waited 25 months to decide the case--and then waited another 27 \nmonths to reject a petition for rehearing, for a total delay of almost \n4\\1/2\\ years after appellate briefing had been completed. This is too \nlong for either defendants or victims to have to wait.\n  The SPA also bars courts of appeals from rehearing successive-\npetition applications on their own motion--current law bars petitions \nfor rehearing or certiorari for such applications, but some courts have \ninterpreted this restriction to not preclude rehearing by the court of \nappeals sua sponte. The SPA also bars Federal courts from tolling the \ncurrent 1-year deadline on filing habeas claims for reasons other than \nthose authorized by the statute, and clarifies when a State appeal is \npending for purposes of tolling the deadline.\n  In addition, the SPA creates uniform, clear procedures for review of \nprocedurally improper claims. Current judicial caselaw creates a series \nof different standards for addressing claims in a Federal petition that \nwere not exhausted in state court, that were presented in a late \namendment, or that were procedurally defaulted. The SPA sets a uniform \nstandard, allowing procedurally improper claims to go forward only if \nthey present meaningful evidence that the defendant did not commit the \ncrime, with all other improper claims barred.\n  The SPA also expands and improves the special expedited habeas \nprocedures authorized in chapter 154 of the United States Code. These \nprocedures are available to States that establish a system for \nproviding high-quality legal representation to capital defendants. \nChapter 154 sets strict time limits on Federal court action and places \nlimits on claims. Currently, however, the court that decides whether a \nState is eligible for chapter 154 is the same court that would be \nsubject to its time limits. Unsurprisingly, these courts\n\n[[Page S5541]]\n\nhave proven resistant to chapter 154. The SPA would place the \neligibility decision in the hands of a neutral party--the U.S. Attorney \nGeneral, with review of his decision in the DC Circuit, which does not \nhear habeas appeals. The SPA also makes chapter 154's deadlines more \npractical by limiting the claims that can be raised under its \nprovisions to those presenting meaningful evidence that the defendant \ndid not commit the crime, and by extending the time for a district \ncourt to review and rule on a chapter 154 petition from 6 months to 15 \nmonths.\n  The SPA also eliminates duplicative Federal review of minor \nsentencing errors that already have been judged by State courts to be \nharmless or not prejudicial. It limits Federal courts to asking only \nwhether the type of sentencing error at issue is one that could not \nhave been harmless.\n  The SPA also applies the deferential review standard enacted in the \n1996 reforms to all pending cases. Remarkably, some current habeas \npetitions still are not governed by the 1996 reforms. The SPA corrects \nthis oversight, ending the need to apply the pre-1996 legal regime to \nany cases that still are being litigated today.\n  And finally, the SPA limits judicial review of State clemency and \npardon decisions, guaranteeing that a State won't be sued for \nformalizing and regularizing its pardon procedures; it limits \ndefendants' ability to ask Federal courts for investigatory funds \nwithout allowing prosecutors to be present and rebut defense \nallegations; and it guarantees a crime victim's right to be notified \nof, to be present at, and to speak at a criminal defendant's Federal \nhabeas hearing.\n  To many people, the issues addressed by the SPA--petitions for \nrehearing, State remedies exhaustion, procedural default, chapter 154, \nAEDPA deference--may seem abstract and remote. For surviving crime \nvictims, however, these matters can be very concrete.\n  A case recently in the news illustrates the importance of these \nconcerns: that of the man who murdered three member of the Ryen family \nand Christopher Hughes in Chino Hills, California in June 1983. The \nkiller in that case was an escaped convict from a nearby prison. He has \nsince admitted that he spent 2 days hiding in a vacant house next to \nthe home of the Ryen family. After several unsuccessful telephone calls \nto friends asking them to give him a ride, the killer took a hatchet \nand buck knife from the vacant house and set out to find a vehicle. The \nCalifornia Supreme Court describes the rest of what occurred, 53 Cal.3d \n771, 794-95:\n\n       On Saturday, June 4, 1983, the Ryens and Chris Hughes \n     attended a barbecue in Los Serranos, a few miles from the \n     Ryen home in Chino. Chris had received permission to spend \n     the night with the Ryens. Between 9 and 9:30 p.m., they left \n     to drive to the Ryen home. Except for Josh [the Ryen's 8-\n     year-old son], they were never seen alive again.\n       The next morning, June 5, Chris's mother, Mary Hughes, \n     became concerned when he did not come home. A number of \n     telephone calls to the Ryen residence received only busy \n     signals. [Mary's husband] William went to the Ryen home to \n     investigate.\n       William observed the Ryen truck at the home, but not the \n     family station wagon. Although the Ryens normally did not \n     lock the house when they were home, it was locked on this \n     occasion. William walked around the house trying to look \n     inside. When he reached the sliding glass doors leading to \n     the master bedroom, he could see inside. William saw the \n     bodies of his son and Doug and Peggy Ryen on the bedroom \n     floor. Josh was lying between Peggy and Chris. Only Josh \n     appeared alive.\n       William frantically tried to open the sliding door; in his \n     emotional state, he pushed against the fixed portion of the \n     doors, not the sliding door. He rushed to the kitchen door, \n     kicked it in, and entered. As he approached the master \n     bedroom, he found Jessica on the floor, also apparently dead. \n     In the bedroom, William touched the body of his son. It was \n     cold and stiff. William asked Josh who had done it. Josh \n     appeared stunned; he tried to talk but could only make \n     unintelligible sounds.\n       William tried to use a telephone in the house but it did \n     not work. He drove to a neighbor's house seeking help. The \n     police arrived shortly. Doug, Peggy, Chris, and Jessica were \n     dead, the first three in the master bedroom, Jessica in the \n     hallway leading to that bedroom. Josh was alive but in shock, \n     suffering from an obvious neck wound. He was flown by \n     helicopter to Loma Linda University Hospital.\n       The victims died from numerous chopping and stabbing \n     injuries. Doug Ryen had at least 37 separate wounds, Peggy \n     32, Jessica 46, and Chris 25. The chopping wounds were \n     inflicted by a sharp, heavy object such as a hatchet or axe, \n     the stabbing wounds by a weapon such as a knife.\n\n  The escaped prisoner who committed this crime was caught 2 months \nlater. Again, he admitted that he stayed in the house next door, but \ndenied any involvement in the murders. According to the California \nSupreme Court, however, the evidence of defendant's guilt was \n``overwhelming.'' Not only had the defendant stayed at the vacant house \nright next door at the time of the murders; the hatchet used in the \nmurders was taken from the vacant house; shoe prints in the Ryen house \nmatched those in the vacant house and were from a type of shoe issued \nto prisoners; bloody items, including a prison-issue button, were found \nin the vacant house; prison-issue tobacco was found in the Ryen station \nwagon, which was recovered in Long Beach; and defendant's blood type \nand hair matched that found in the Ryen house. Defendant was convicted \nof the murders and sentenced to death in 1985, and the California \nSupreme Court upheld the defendant's conviction and sentence in 1991.\n  The defendant's Federal habeas proceedings began shortly thereafter, \nand they continue to this day--22 years after the murders. In 2000, the \ndefendant asked the courts for DNA testing of a blood spot in the Ryen \nhouse, a t-shirt near the crime scene, and the tobacco found in the \ncar. Despite the overwhelming evidence of his guilt, the courts allowed \nmore testing. All three tests found that the blood and saliva matched \ndefendant, to a degree of certainty of one in 320 billion. Blood on the \nt-shirt matched both the defendant and one of the victims.\n  One might have thought that this would end the case. Not so. In \nFebruary 2004, the en banc Ninth Circuit sua sponte authorized \ndefendant to file a second habeas petition to pursue theories that \npolice had planted this DNA evidence. Since the evidence had been in \ncourt custody since 1983, the Ninth Circuit's theory not only required \npolice to plan and execute a vast conspiracy to plant the evidence--it \nalso required them to foresee the future invention of the DNA \ntechnology that would make that evidence useful in future habeas \nproceedings.\n  The Streamlined Procedures Act would have made a difference in this \ncase. For example, it would have eliminated the need to return to state \ncourt to exhaust new claims, reducing the delay in the Federal \nproceedings by nearly 3 years. It would have applied the 1996 reforms \nto this case, allowing deferential review of state factual findings and \nlegal analysis. It would have placed time limits on Federal appeals \ncourt decisionmaking and grants of rehearing. And it would have \nprevented the court of appeals from ordering rehearing of the \ndefendant's successive-petition application on its own motion, thereby \nbarring the current round of O.J. Simpson-style conspiracy-theory \nlitigation. The SPA could have brought this case to closure a long time \nago.\n  And this case deserves to be brought to closure. One cannot \nunderestimate the grievous impact that crimes like these have on the \nfamilies of the victims. Mary Hughes, the mother of 11-year-old \nChristopher Hughes, who was sleeping over at the Ryen house on the \nnight of the murders, has spoken movingly of the loss of her son:\n\n       Christopher Hughes loved his bicycle, swimming and showing \n     off for his mom and dad.\n       The 11-year-old's bedroom was filled with swimming trophies \n     and Star Wars collectibles. He was a handsome kid who was \n     chased by a lot of fifth-grade girls on the playground during \n     recess at Our Lady of the Assumption in Claremont.\n       He wasn't short on friends, either.\n       Christopher really liked Joshua Ryen, an 8-year-old boy who \n     lived up the street from him. They would trick-or-treat \n     together on Halloween, play together, and their parents were \n     good friends.\n       On the night of June 4 1983, Christopher asked his parents \n     if he could spend the night at the Ryen house.\n       It was a decision that would change the Hughes family \n     forever.\n       [Mary Hughes'] son Christopher would have been 32 today. \n     She sometimes wonders who he would have been, what he \n     would've looked like, and even during her most solemn \n     moments, she wonders what life would've been like if Cooper \n     had never gone to the Ryens' house.\n       ``It never really ever gets better,'' she said. ``Kevin \n     Cooper robbed him of the chance to be a child, to attend his \n     first dance, to have a girlfriend, and to one day get married \n     and\n\n[[Page S5542]]\n\n     have kids of his own. He robbed me of my child.''\n       Mary Ann Hughes does have one special memory of her son she \n     holds close to her heart. A week before his death, she took \n     him to see the movie ``Return of the Jedi.''\n       ``He was so happy. It was such a great day,'' she said. \n     ``It seems like such a small thing, but it's the best memory \n     I have of both of us.'' (Sara Carter, ``He Was at the \n     Beginning of His Life When He Died,'' Inland Valley Daily \n     Bulletin, February 9, 2004.)\n\n  In light of how much the surviving family already has suffered, one \nmight expect that all participants in the criminal proceedings would \ntake great concern and care for the feelings of the family. \nUnfortunately, that has not been the case. The Ninth Circuit has proved \nwilling to turn the appeals into a three-ring circus, allowing \ncontinual pursuit of the most frivolous conspiracy theories. The impact \nof these now 22 years of trial and appeals on the victims' families has \nbeen predictable: they feel that they and the victims have become \nirrelevant to the entire process. Shortly after the Ninth Circuit \nauthorized an additional round of appeals in this case, a local \nnewspaper described what the families have experienced:\n\n       For nearly 20 years, since convicted murderer Kevin Cooper \n     was sentenced to death for the 1983 slayings of a Chino Hills \n     family and their young houseguest, families of the victims \n     have waited silently for the day the hand of justice would \n     grant them peace.\n       For those families, the last two decades have seemed like \n     an eternity.\n       ``I lived through a nightmare,'' said Herbert Ryen, whose \n     brother Douglas Ryen was among those killed, along with \n     Douglas' wife Peggy, their 11-year-old daughter Jessica, and \n     her 10-year-old friend Christopher Hughes.\n       [O]n the morning of Feb. 9, [2004,] the day of Cooper's \n     scheduled death by lethal injection, word came down that the \n     9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had decided to block the \n     execution.\n       [T]o the Ryen and Hughes families, the stay just hours \n     before Cooper's scheduled execution at San Quentin State \n     Prison was nearly incomprehensible. The indefinite delay has \n     left them in a sort of emotional limbo, questioning whether \n     the legal system had abandoned them.\n       ``The bottom line is that this whole issue is not about \n     Kevin Cooper . . . it is about the death penalty,'' said Mary \n     Ann Hughes, the mother of Christoper Hughes. ``We're so mad--\n     mad because we feel as though the courts turned their back on \n     my son.''\n       ``They (Court of Appeals) are holding us hostage,'' Hughes \n     said.\n       For Herbert Ryen and his wife Sue, waiting for justice has \n     taken an equally destructive toll on their lives. The torment \n     their family experienced following the murders, and the \n     subsequent years lost to depression, could never be replaced, \n     he said from his home in Arizona.\n       Mary Ann Hughes said the pain her family suffers is only \n     amplified by the seemingly continuous bombardment of \n     celebrities campaigning against Cooper's execution. She \n     wonders who will cry out in anger for the victims.\n       One former television star and anti-death penalty activist, \n     Mike Farrell of the popular series MASH, spoke of the case on \n     a recent news program.\n       ``He claimed that we must feel relieved since the stay of \n     execution was granted,'' Hughes said. ``How can (Farrell) \n     have the audacity to say he knows what we are feeling?''\n       Farrell could not be reached for comment.\n       Since Christopher's death, the Hughes family has chosen to \n     remain out of the media spotlight. And until recently, their \n     efforts were successful, due largely to the support of their \n     surviving children, family members and a strong network of \n     close friends, Hughes said.\n       The court's decision Feb. 9 has re-opened the case, forcing \n     the families to re-live the nightmare they have fought so \n     hard to leave behind, they say.\n       Mary Ann Hughes is left wondering about other families who \n     have had loved ones taken from them, about the legal battles \n     they have had to endure in their own quests for justice.\n       She thinks of the parents of Samantha Runion, the 5-year-\n     old Orange County girl who was murdered in 2003, and of what \n     her family could face in the next 20 years.\n       For Bill Hughes, the anguish is intensified--he will \n     forever know the pain of walking into the Ryens' home the \n     morning after the murders, and finding his son, dead and \n     covered in blood near the Ryens' bedroom door. He was also \n     the first to discover Joshua Ryen, also drenched in blood, \n     clinging to life.\n       ``It is a memory he will always have to live with,'' Mary \n     Ann Hughes said.\n       Indeed, time has been no friend to the victims' families, \n     as California's recent appellate court ruling has further \n     denied them closure, she added.\n       ``What this decision has done to our legal system in \n     California is unthinkable,'' she said. ``Somewhere along the \n     line, the courts have got to uphold the law, and we will wait \n     it out until they do.'' (Sara Carter, ``Families of Murder \n     Victims Wait for Justice in Cooper Case,'' Inland Valley \n     Daily Bulletin, February 24, 2004.)\n\n  Mary Hughes' story demonstrates why the use of Federal judicial power \nmust be measured and fair it illustrates the heavy cost imposed by \njudicial excess.\n  No statement, however, better explains the gross cruelty caused by \nallowing endless litigation and appeals in a case like this than that \ngiven by one of the surviving victims of the 1983 attack. Josh Ryen was \n8 years old when he was stabbed in his parents' bedroom and his parents \nand sister were murdered. He is now 30 years old. On April 22, 2005, he \ngave a statement pursuant to the recently enacted Crime Victims' Rights \nAct in the federal habeas corpus hearing for his parents and sister's \nkiller. I will close my remarks by asking unanimous consent that Josh \nRyen's statement be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nStatement of Joshua Ryen, United States District Court for the District \n                              of San Diego\n\n       April 22, 2005.--The first time I met Kevin Cooper I was 8 \n     years old and he slit my throat. He hit me with a hatchet and \n     put a hole in my skull. He stabbed me twice, which broke my \n     ribs and collapsed one lung. I lived only because I stuck \n     four fingers in my neck to slow the bleeding, but I was too \n     weak to move. I laid there 11 hours looking at my mother who \n     was right beside me.\n       I know now he came through the sliding glass door and \n     attacked my dad first. He was lying on the bed and was struck \n     in the dark without warning with the hatchet and knife. He \n     was hit many times because there is a lot of blood on the \n     wall on his side of the bed.\n       My mother screamed and Cooper came around the bed and \n     started hitting her. Somehow my dad was able to struggle \n     between the bed and the closet but Cooper bludgeoned my \n     father to death with the knife and hatchet, stabbing him 26 \n     times and axing him 11. One of the blows severed his finger \n     and it landed in the closet. My mother tried to get away but \n     he caught her at the bottom of the bed and he stabbed her 25 \n     times and axed her 7.\n       All of us kids were drawn to the room by mom's screams. \n     Jessica was killed in the doorway with 5 ax blows and 46 \n     stabs. I won't say how many times my best friend Chris was \n     stabbed and axed, not because it isn't important, but because \n     I don't want to hurt his family in any way, and they are \n     here.\n       After Cooper killed everyone, and thought he had killed me, \n     he went over to my sister and lifted her shirt and drew \n     things on her stomach with the knife. Then he walked down the \n     hallway, opened the refrigerator, and had a beer. I guess \n     killing so many people can make a man thirsty.\n       I don't want to be here. I came because I owe it to my \n     family, who can't speak for themselves. But by coming I am \n     acknowledging and validating the existence of Kevin Cooper, \n     who should have been blotted from the face of the earth a \n     long time ago. By coming here it shows that he still controls \n     me. I will be free, my life will start, the day Kevin Cooper \n     dies. I want to be rid of him, but he won't go away.\n       I've been trying to get away from him since I was 8 years \n     and I can't escape. He haunts me and follows me. For over 20 \n     years all I've heard is Kevin Cooper this and Kevin Cooper \n     that. Kevin Cooper says he is innocent, Kevin Cooper says he \n     was framed, Kevin Cooper says DNA will clear him, Kevin \n     Cooper says blood was planted, Kevin Cooper says the tennis \n     shoes aren't his, Kevin Cooper says three guys did it, Kevin \n     Cooper says police planted evidence, Kevin Cooper gets \n     another stay from another court and sends everyone off on \n     another wild goose chase.\n       The courts say there isn't any harm when Kevin Cooper gets \n     another stay and another hearing. This just shows they don't \n     care about me, because every time he gets another delay I am \n     harmed and have to relive the murders all over again. Every \n     time Kevin Cooper opens his mouth everyone wants to know what \n     I think, what I have to say, how I'm feeling, and the whole \n     nightmare floods all over me again: the barbecue, me begging \n     to let Chris spend the night, me in my bed and him on the \n     floor beside me, my mother's screams, Chris gone, dark house, \n     hallway, bushy hair, everything black, mom cut to pieces \n     saturated in blood, the nauseating smell of blood, eleven \n     hours unable to move, light filtering in, Chris' father at \n     the window, the horror of his face, sound of the front door \n     splintering, my pajamas being cut off, people trying to save \n     me, the whap whap of the helicopter blades, shouted \n     questions, everything fading to black.\n       Every time Cooper claims he's innocent and sends people \n     scurrying off on another wild goose chase, I have to relive \n     the murders all over again. It runs like a horror movie, over \n     and over again and never stops because he never shuts up. He \n     puts PR people on national television who say outrageous \n     things and then the press wants to know what I think. What I \n     think is that I would like to be rid of Kevin Cooper. I would \n     like for him to go away. I would like to never hear from \n     Kevin Cooper again. I would like Kevin Cooper to pay for what \n     he did.\n       I dread happy times like Christmas and Thanksgiving. If I \n     go to a friend's house on\n\n[[Page S5543]]\n\n     holidays I look at all the mothers and fathers and children \n     and grandchildren and get sad because I have no one. Kevin \n     Cooper took them from me.\n       I get terrified when I go into any place dark, like a house \n     before the lights are on. I hear screams and see flashbacks \n     and shadows. Even with lights on I see terrible things. After \n     I was stabbed and axed I was too weak to move and stared at \n     my mother all night. I smelled this overpowering smell of \n     fresh blood and knew everyone had been slaughtered.\n       Every day when I comb my hair I feel the hole where he \n     buried the hatchet in my head, and when I look in the mirror \n     I see the scar where he cut my throat from ear to ear and I \n     put four fingers in it to stop the bleeding which, they say, \n     saved my life. Every year I lose hearing in my left ear where \n     he buried the knife.\n       Helicopters give me flashbacks of life flight and my \n     Incredible Hulks being cut off by paramedics. Bushy hair \n     reminds me of the killer. Silence reminds me of the quiet \n     before the screams. Cooper is everywhere. There is no escape \n     from him.\n       I feel very guilty and responsible to the Hughes family \n     because I begged them to let Chris spend the night. If I \n     hadn't done that he wouldn't have died. I apologize to them \n     and especially to Mr. Hughes for having to find us and see \n     his son cut and stabbed to death.\n       I thank the judge who gave my grandma custody of me because \n     she took good care of me and loves me very much.\n       I'm grateful to the ocean for giving me peace because when \n     I go there I know my mother and father and sister's ashes are \n     sprinkled there.\n       Kevin Cooper has movie stars and Jesse Jackson holding \n     rallies for him, people carrying signs, lighting candles, \n     saying prayers. To them and you I say:\n\n     I was 8 when he slit my throat,\n     It was dark and I couldn't see.\n\n     Through the night and day I laid there,\n     trying to get up and flee.\n\n     He killed my mother, father, sister, friend,\n     And started stalking me.\n     I try to run and flee from him but cannot get away,\n     While he demands petitions and claims, some fresh absurdity.\n     Justice has no ear for me nor cares about my plight,\n     while crowds pray for the killer and light candles in the \n           night.\n     To those who long for justice and love truth which sets men \n           free, When you pray\n     your prayers tonight, please remember me.\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Mr. Cochran, and Mr. Dodd):\n  S. 1089. A bill to establish the National Foreign Language \nCoordination Council to develop and implement a foreign language \nstrategy, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the National \nLanguage Coordination Act of 2005 which provides a framework for \nleading and coordination the learning of foreign languages and \ncultures, with my good friends Senators Cochran and Dodd. \n  The National Foreign Language Coordination Act would create the \nposition of a National Language Director and a National Foreign \nLanguage Coordination Council to develop and oversee the implementation \nof a foreign language strategy. The proposed Council, chaired by the \nNational Language Director, would identify crucial priorities, increase \npublic awareness of the need for foreign language skills, advocate \nmaximum use of resources, coordinate cross-sector efforts, and monitor \nthe foreign language activities of the Federal Government.\n  The genesis of this legislation is a report entitled, ``A Call to \nAction for National Foreign Language Capabilities,'' issued by the \nNational Language Conference held in June 2004 under the auspices of \nthe Department of Defense. This conference was an extraordinary \ngathering of government, industry, academia, and language association \nrepresentatives. The mission of this meeting was twofold: to discuss \nand deliberate initial strategic approaches to meeting the nation's \nlanguage needs in the 21st century, and to identify actions that could \nmove the United States toward a ``language-competent nation.'' It was \nhosted by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel \nand Readiness and by the Center for Advanced Study of Language (CASL) \nat the University of Maryland at College Park.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the executive summary of the report, ``A \nCall to Action for National Foreign Language Capabilities,'' be printed \nin the Record following my remarks.\n  I believe the recommendations of this report speak eloquently to the \nneed for this legislation. As Dr. David Chu, Undersecretary of Defense \nfor Personnel and Readiness, notes in his forward to the report, \n``improving the nation's foreign language capability requires immediate \nand long-term engagement.''\n  The intent of this legislation is to ensure that immediate and long-\nterm engagement.\n  The establishment of a National Language Director and the creation of \na National Foreign Language Coordination Council will ensure that the \nkey recommendations of the Department of Defense sponsored conference \nwill be implemented, which include: developing policies and programs \nthat build the nation's language and cultural understanding capability; \nengaging federal, state, and local agencies and the private sector in \nsolutions; developing language and cultural competency across public \nand private sectors; developing language skills in a wide range of \ncritical languages; strengthening our education system, programs, and \ntools in foreign languages and cultures; and integrating language \ntraining into career fields and increase the number of language \nprofessionals.\n  The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, showed how much more was \nneeded to improve education in these critical areas. The investigations \nsurrounding the attacks have underscored how important foreign language \nproficiency is to our national security. The Joint Intelligence \nCommittee inquiry into the terrorist attacks found that prior to \nSeptember 11, the Intelligence Community was not prepared to handle the \nchallenge of translating the volumes of foreign language counter-\nterrorism intelligence that had been collected. Agencies within the \nIntelligence Community experienced backlogs in material awaiting \ntranslation and a shortage of language specialists and language-\nqualified field officers in the most critical terrorism-related \nlanguages used by terrorists.\n  America needs people who understand foreign cultures and who are \nfluent in locally-spoken languages. The stability and economic vitality \nof the United States and our national security depend on American \ncitizens who are knowledgeable about the world. We need civil servants, \nincluding law enforcement officers, teachers, area experts, diplomats, \nand business people with the ability to communicate at an advanced \nlevel in the languages and understand the cultures of the people with \nwhom they interact.\n  Experts tell us we should develop long-term relationships with people \nfrom every walk of life all across the world, whether or not the \nlanguages they speak are considered critical for a particular issue or \nemergency.\n  They are right.\n  As then-Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz noted at the \nNational Language Conference, ``The greater our ability to communicate \nwith people, the easier the burden on our troops and the greater the \nlikelihood that we can complete our missions and bring our people home \nsafely. Even better, the greater our linguistic skill, the greater the \npossibility that we can resolve international differences and achieve \nour objectives without having to use force.''\n  I am proud of my own State of Hawaii, whose language patterns reflect \nthat we are a mixing pot of varying cultures. According to the 2000 \nCensus, more than 300,000 people or about 27 percent of those five \nyears and older spoke a language other than English at home. This is \ncompared to about 18 percent nationwide. Language education offerings \nto improve conversational proficiency with formal training in non-\nEnglish languages are working to keep pace with increased demand. In \naddition, enrollments in foreign language courses at the University of \nHawaii have been markedly increasing--a trend that I am gratified to \nsee happening across the country. But more needs to be done both in \nHawaii and the rest of the country.\n  I am a passionate believer in beginning these programs at the \nearliest age possible. Americans need to be open to the world; we need \nto be able to see the world through the eyes of others if we are going \nto understand how to resolve the complex problems we face.\n  The need to hear and understand one another is timeless and \nessential.\n  An ongoing commitment to developing language and cultural expertise\n\n[[Page S5544]]\n\nhelps prevent a crisis from occurring and provides diplomatic and \nlanguage resources when needed. We cannot afford to seek out foreign \nlanguage skills after an event like 9/11 occurs. The failures of \ncommunication and understanding have already done their damage. We must \nprovide an ongoing commitment to language education and encourage \nknowledge of foreign languages and cultures.\n  The answer is simple. If we are committed to maintaining these \nrelationships and creating a language proficient citizenry, we must \nhave leadership. The National Foreign Language Coordination Act will \nprovide this leadership and ensure that we are aware and involved in \nthe world around us.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n  There being no objection, the materials were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           Executive Summary--A Call to Action and Leadership\n\n       Vision: Our vision is a world in which the United States is \n     a stronger global leader through proficiency in foreign \n     languages and understanding of the cultures of the world. \n     These abilities are strengths of our public and private \n     sectors and pillars of our educational system. The \n     government, academic, and private sectors contribute to, and \n     mutually benefit from, these national capabilities.\n       The terrorist attacks of September 11th, the Global War on \n     Terrorism, and the continued threat to our Homeland have \n     defined the critical need to take action to improve the \n     foreign language and cultural capabilities of the Nation. We \n     must act now to improve the gathering and analysis of \n     information, advance international diplomacy, and support \n     military operations. We must act to retain our global market \n     leadership and succeed against increasingly sophisticated \n     competitors whose workforces possess potent combinations of \n     professional skills, knowledge of other cultures, and \n     multiple language proficiencies. Our domestic well-being \n     demands action to provide opportunities for all students to \n     learn foreign languages important for the Nation, develop the \n     capabilities of our heritage communities, and ensure services \n     that are core to our quality of life.\n       Success in this crucial undertaking will depend on \n     leadership strong enough to:\n       Implement policies, programs, and legislation that build \n     the national language and cultural understanding capability;\n       Engage Federal, state, and local agencies and the private \n     sector in solutions;\n       Develop language and cultural competency across public and \n     private sectors;\n       Develop language skills in a wide range of critical \n     languages;\n       Strengthen our education system, programs, and tools in \n     foreign languages and cultures; and\n       Integrate language training into career fields and increase \n     the number of language professionals, especially in the less \n     commonly taught languages.\n       Leadership must be comprehensive, as no one sector--\n     government, industry, or academia--has all of the needs for \n     language and cultural competency, or all of the solutions. \n     Some actions must be initiated immediately by specific \n     agencies and Federal Departments should organize to work on \n     proposed recommendations. Other necessary solutions must be \n     long-term, strategic, and `` involve multiple organizations \n     in all levels. To accomplish this agenda, the Nation needs:\n       A National Language Authority appointed by the President to \n     develop and implement a national foreign language strategy;\n       A National Foreign Language Coordination Council to \n     coordinate implementation of the national foreign language \n     strategy.\n       This is the Call to Action to move the Nation toward a 21st \n     century vision.\n\n                                S. 1089\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``National Foreign Language \n     Coordination Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) there is a severe shortage of qualified language \n     professionals, including teachers, translators, and \n     interpreters, especially in less commonly taught languages, \n     across the United States;\n       (2) Federal, State, and local governments need individuals \n     with bilingual and bicultural capabilities, including--\n       (A) diplomats;\n       (B) defense and intelligence analysts;\n       (C) military personnel;\n       (D) foreign language instructors;\n       (E) health professionals;\n       (F) medical and social services providers;\n       (G) court interpreters;\n       (H) translators; and\n       (I) law enforcement officers;\n       (3) deficiencies in the national language capabilities \n     have--\n       (A) undermined cross-cultural communication and \n     understanding at home and abroad;\n       (B) restrained social mobility;\n       (C) lessened national commercial competitiveness;\n       (D) limited the effectiveness of public diplomacy;\n       (E) restricted justice and government services to sectors \n     of society; and\n       (F) threatened national security;\n       (4) ample resources are not available to develop language \n     and cultural capabilities in all of the world's languages, \n     requiring prioritization of such resources; and\n       (5) a National Foreign Language Coordination Council and a \n     National Language Director can help to raise public awareness \n     and provide top-down coordination and direction.\n\n     SEC. 3.

(2) thanks Archbishop Iakovos for his service to the \n     members of his church and to the people of this Nation;\n       (3) honors Archbishop Iakovos' commitment to the principles \n     of

Mr. President, I would like to announce for the \ninformation of the Senate and the public that the Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations will hold a hearing entitled ``The \nContainer Security Initiative and the Customs-Trade Partnership Against \nTerrorism: Securing the Global Supply Chain or Trojan Horse?'' In light \nof the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, concern has increased \nthat terrorists could smuggle weapons of mass destruction in the \napproximately 9 million ocean going containers that arrive in the \nUnited States every year. As part of its overall response to the threat \nof terrorism, the Department of Homeland Security's Bureau of Customs \nand Border Protection (Customs) implemented the Container Security \nInitiative, CSI, to screen high-risk containers at sea ports overseas, \nthus employing screening tools before potentially dangerous cargoes \nreach our shores. Customs also implemented the Customs Trade \nPartnership Against Terrorism, C-TPAT, to improve the security of the \nglobal supply chain in partnership with the private sector.\n  Both CSI and C-TPAT face a number of compelling challenges that \nimpact their ability to safeguard our Nation from terrorism. The \nSubcommittee's May 26 hearing will examine how Customs utilizes CSI and \nC-TPAT in connection with its other enforcement programs and review the \nrequirements for and challenges involved in transitioning CSI and C-\nTPAT from promising risk management concepts to effective and sustained \nenforcement operations. These important Customs initiatives require \nsustained Congressional oversight. As such, this will be the first of \nseveral hearings the Subcommittee intends to hold on the response of \nthe Federal Government to terrorist threats.\n  The Subcommittee hearing is scheduled for Thursday, May 26, 2005, at \n9:30 a.m. in Room 562 of the Dirksen Senate Office Building. For \nfurther information, please contact Raymond V. Shepherd, III, Staff \nDirector and Chief Counsel to the Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations, at 202-224-3721.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/19/senate-section/article/S5547-2", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5547]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n                     committee on foreign relations\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 150, submitted \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 150) expressing continued support for \n     the construction of the Victims of Communism Memorial.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I submitted a resolution with my \ncolleague, Senator Smith of Oregon, that I think is especially \npertinent this week as we commemorate the 60th anniversary of the \ndefeat of Nazi Germany. The end of World War II in Europe brought the \nend of Hitler's regime and all of its horrors, but it did not, \nunfortunately, usher in an era that was free of tyranny as so many had \nhoped. Instead, the Soviet Union solidified its illegal occupation of \nits three Baltic neighbors, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, and \ncommunism's global expansion condemned millions to totalitarian rule or \ndeath.\n  The resolution we submitted expresses support for the construction of \nthe Victims of Communism Memorial here in Washington, DC. Authorized by \nCongress in 1993, memoria1 will honor the more than 100 million victims \nof communist atrocities around the globe. The overwhelming carnage and \nsuffering that occurred at the hand of international communism must \nnever be forgotten. The Victims of Communism Memorial will pay tribute, \nin our Nation's capital, to those who lost their lives to communist \ntyranny. Construction of the Memorial is scheduled to begin in the fall \nof 2005, and when it is completed it will serve as an enduring reminder \nof communist atrocities and of the value of our Nation's commitment to \nfreedom.\n  I will also join my colleague from Oregon in submitting a resolution \nthat calls on the Russian Government to acknowledge the Soviet Union's \nillegal annexation of the three Baltic nations of Estonia, Latvia, and \nLithuania during the Second World War and to condemn this aggression by \nthe USSR. In 1939, Joseph Stalin allied himself with Adolf Hitler with \nthe signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, an agreement that led to \nthe Soviet Union's occupation of the Baltic countries in 1940. For five \ndecades, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania were forced to live under the \nauthoritarian rule of the Soviet empire.\n  When I speak about the Baltic countries, I speak with a particularly \npersonal interest. Lithuania has a special meaning to me because it is \nmy mother's birthplace, and I have visited there a number of times. \nWhen I visited Lithuania for the first time in 1979, it was under \nSoviet domination. Freedom was at a premium, and the poor people of \nthat country struggled day after day wondering if they would ever have \nanother chance at self-governance. I have journeyed to the region on \nseveral occasions since then, and I have witnessed the miracle of \nindependence and democracy coming to Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia. \nThe amazing transformation for these nations was something that many of \nus with strong ties to this part of the world had prayed for but never \nbelieved would happen in our lifetime.\n  The legacy of Soviet occupation remains strong even today. \nUnfortunately, Russia's leaders refuse to acknowledge the wrongs \ncommitted by the Soviet Union against the Baltic nations. Russian \nPresident Vladimir Putin rejected a suggestion from U.S. officials that \nhe renounce the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, and he has publicly clung to \nthe fiction that Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania asked to become part of \nthe Soviet Union. In order for relations between the Baltic nations and \nRussia to move forward, the Russian Government and its people must \nhonestly and publicly confront the USSR's brutal legacy of repression. \nThis resolution will call on Russian leaders to take that important \nstep.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nand preamble be agreed to en bloc; that the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table; and that any statements relating to the resolution \nbe printed in the Record, without intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S.

Res. 151\n\n       Whereas in May 1948, the State of Israel was established as \n     a sovereign and independent nation;\n       Whereas the United States was one of the first nations to \n     recognize Israel, only 11 minutes after its creation;\n       Whereas Israel has provided the opportunity for Jews from \n     all over the world to reestablish their ancient homeland;\n       Whereas Israel is home to many religious sites which are \n     sacred to Judaism, Christianity, and Islam;\n       Whereas Israel provided a refuge to Jews who survived the \n     horrors of the Holocaust and the evils committed by the Nazis \n     which were unprecedented in human history;\n       Whereas the people of Israel have established a unique, \n     pluralistic democracy which includes the freedoms cherished \n     by the people of the United States, including freedom of \n     speech, freedom of religion, freedom of association, freedom \n     of the press, and government by the consent of the governed;\n       Whereas Israel continues to serve as a shining model of \n     democratic values by regularly holding free and fair \n     elections, promoting the free exchange of ideas, and \n     vigorously exercising in its Parliament, the Knesset, a \n     democratic government that is fully representative of its \n     citizens;\n       Whereas Israel has bravely defended itself from attacks \n     repeatedly since independence;\n       Whereas the Government of Israel has successfully worked \n     with the neighboring Governments of Egypt and Jordan to \n     establish peaceful, bilateral relations;\n       Whereas, despite the deaths of over one thousand innocent \n     Israelis at the hands of murderous, suicide bombers and other \n     terrorists during the past 4 years, the people of Israel \n     continue to seek peace with their Palestinian neighbors;\n       Whereas the United States and Israel enjoy a strategic \n     partnership based on shared mutual democratic values, \n     friendship, and respect;\n       Whereas the people of the United States share affinity with \n     the people of Israel and view Israel as a strong and trusted \n     ally; and\n\n[[Page S5549]]\n\n       Whereas Israel has made significant global contributions in \n     the fields of science, medicine, and technology: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the independence of the State of Israel as a \n     significant event in providing refuge and a national homeland \n     for the Jewish people;\n       (2) strongly supports efforts to bring peace to the Middle \n     East, including the disengagement plan of the Israeli \n     government, the Roadmap, and the recent Quartet decision to \n     appoint World Bank President James Wolfensohn as Coordinator \n     for Gaza Disengagement;\n       (3) commends the bipartisan commitment of all United States \n     administrations and United States Congresses since 1948 to \n     stand by Israel and work for its security and well-being; and\n       (4) extends warm congratulations and best wishes to the \n     people of Israel as they celebrate the 57th anniversary of \n     Israel's independence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/19/senate-section/article/S5549-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5549]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           MEASURES READ THE FIRST TIME--S. 1084 AND S. 1085\n\n  Mr. ALLEN.
