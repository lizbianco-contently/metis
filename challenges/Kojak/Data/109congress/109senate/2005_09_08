Mr. President, my thoughts are with all of those from the \nGulf Coast States affected by Hurricane Katrina as they mourn the loss \nof family and friends and neighbors. We wish them well.\n  I know there are no words that can provide the needed comfort. I \nbelieve there must be an extensive examination of what went wrong with \nthe Government's response to this natural disaster.\n  As hundreds of thousands of Americans look toward rebuilding their \nlives, our first priority must be to ensure that all possible Federal \nresources are at their disposal. However, it is Congress's job to get \nto the bottom of what went wrong and to do whatever is necessary to \nensure that it never happens again. I join those who say we must not \nengage in a blame game but, rather, we must come together to undertake \nresponsible oversight.\n  I say this from an interesting vantage point because throughout the \ndebate over the creation of the Department of Homeland Security in \n2002, I repeatedly expressed my strong concern that nonhomeland \nsecurity functions of the Federal Government would be diminished if \nincluded in the new Department. I said that eliminating the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency's status as an independent agency to join \nthis proposed Department could seriously affect FEMA's traditional role \nof responding to natural disasters.\n  At Under Secretary Michael Brown's confirmation hearing to be Deputy \nDirector of FEMA in June 2002, 5 months before the Homeland Security \nAct passed, I spoke about the perils of converting FEMA into a homeland \nsecurity centric agency. At the time, I said:\n\n       The President's proposal for a new Department of Homeland \n     Security will include the Federal Emergency Management \n     Agency. A key question is how will this new role for FEMA in \n     homeland security affect its traditional mission?\n        . . . Many of the agencies impacted by this proposal, \n     including FEMA, have a number of core responsibilities \n     unrelated to their homeland security missions. Most of what \n     FEMA does every day, and what Americans\n\n[[Page S9742]]\n\n     expect from FEMA, does not fall under the category of \n     homeland security.\n\n  Because of my strong belief that the nonhomeland security functions \nof FEMA, the Coast Guard, and other agencies that are now part of DHS \nwould be diminished when merged into this massive agency, I \nsuccessfully offered an amendment to the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee's version of the Homeland Security Act, cosponsored by \nSenator Carper, that required all nonhomeland security functions of \neach of the 22 legacy agencies to be identified, along with the \nresources needed to preserve these functions.\n  Unfortunately, the version of the bill passed by Congress failed to \ninclude my amendment, which is one of the reasons that I was one of \neight Senators who voted against the creation of DHS.\n  In a further effort to ensure constancy of the nonhomeland security \nfunctions of DHS, I introduced in April 2003 legislation that would \nhave required the Department to identify annually the resources, \npersonnel, and capabilities devoted to nonhomeland security functions. \nMy measure would have required DHS to include this information in its \nannual performance report, as well as required the Government \nAccountability Office to evaluate the Department's performance of \nessential nonhomeland security missions.\n  When introducing my bill, S. 910, the Nonhomeland Security Mission \nPerformance Act of 2003, I said:\n\n       The cost of creating a Department of Homeland Security \n     should not come at the expense of these essential missions. \n     Agencies should strike the proper balance between new \n     homeland security responsibilities and their critical \n     nonhomeland security missions. Enhancing traditional missions \n     also enhances domestic security which depends on sound \n     management strategies that ensure adequate resources and \n     personnel.\n\n  S. 910 was reported favorably by the Governmental Affairs Committee \nbut was, unfortunately, never considered by the full Senate.\n  I stand before my colleagues today to ask that we look at the \ndisaster that has befallen the people of the gulf coast as a reminder \nthat preventing terrorism is not the only business of the Department of \nHomeland Security. My colleagues and I must carefully reexamine whether \ncritical nonhomeland security missions have been compromised by their \ndecisions in DHS.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my statement from the Governmental \nAffairs Committee hearing for Michael Brown's confirmation to be Deputy \nDirector of FEMA on June 19, 2002, and my statement on the introduction \nof S. 910, the Nonhomeland Security Mission Performance Act, on April \n11, 2003, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs\n\n\n  Nomination hearing for Michael Brown to be Deputy Director of FEMA, \n                             June 19, 2002\n\n       I wish to welcome our nominee to the Committee. Since you \n     and I met a month ago, it seems that the nature of the \n     position to which you have been nominated has changed \n     dramatically.\n       The President's proposal for a new Department of Homeland \n     Security will include Federal Emergency Management Agency \n     (FEMA). A key question is how will this new role for FEMA in \n     Homeland Security affect its traditional mission?\n       There is already a Federal Response Plan that does what the \n     President says the new Department will do, that is, ``the \n     Homeland Security Department will integrate the Federal \n     interagency emergency response plans into a single \n     comprehensive, government-wide plan.'' Since 1992, a Federal \n     Response Plan has managed the activities of 26 Federal \n     agencies and the Red Cross during all phases of a disaster, \n     including readiness, response, recovery, and mitigation. In \n     1999, FEMA published the second edition of the Federal \n     Response Plan Terrorism Incident Annex.\n       When necessary, FEMA has made agreements with specific \n     government agencies to address terrorism. In January 2001, \n     FEMA and the Department of Justice released an Interagency \n     Domestic Terrorism Concept of Operations Plan (CONPLAN). FEMA \n     is currently working with the Catastrophic Disaster Response \n     Group (CDRG), made up of representatives of all federal \n     agencies, to update the Federal Response Plan in light of the \n     lessons learned from September 11th. These changes are to be \n     integrated with the national strategy for homeland security, \n     on which Governor Ridge has spent the past eight months \n     working.\n       I hope the proposed department will build on all the \n     different plans and agreements already in place. We do not \n     need a brand new coordination plan. What we need is better \n     communication and implementation of the plans we have.\n       The President and his staff compare this reorganization to \n     the creation of the Department of Defense after World War II. \n     However, there are many differences. The Departments of the \n     Navy and the Army shared the primary mission of defending the \n     United States. They were both military departments with \n     similar cultures and management priorities.\n       In contrast, many of the agencies impacted by this \n     proposal, including FEMA, have a number of core \n     responsibilities unrelated to their homeland security \n     missions. Most of what FEMA does every day, and what \n     Americans expect from FEMA, does not fall under the \n     description of homeland security.\n       Homeland security is strengthened through developing assets \n     that are built day-by-day and community-by-community. These \n     assets include well-trained firefighters and law-enforcement \n     officers, well-equipped medical personnel, and well-exercised \n     emergency response drills.\n       An example is when FEMA partnered with local and state \n     agencies to help residents on the Island of Hawaii in the \n     wake of tropical storms and flooding last year. It is the \n     dedicated men and women who form the FEMA family who continue \n     to build on these relationships and provide federal \n     assistance to those most in need. Just this year, FEMA \n     assisted flood victims in West Virginia, Kentucky, and \n     Illinois and is working with communities devastated by \n     wildfires in Colorado and New Mexico.\n       Every state in the Union, including Hawaii, works with FEMA \n     to include disaster mitigation when rebuilding after an \n     event. Cities and counties across the country are working \n     with FEMA to lessen the impact of future natural disasters \n     through mitigation programs.\n       These efforts are all-hazard and will help communities \n     respond to floods and terrorist attacks. However, there are \n     those in the Administration who have criticized mitigation \n     efforts and have questioned their cost and benefit.\n       FEMA's pre-disaster mitigation program was eliminated in \n     the President's 2002 budget because it was deemed ineffective \n     by the Office of Management and Budget. Congress disagreed \n     and saved the $25 million program only to see the \n     Administration's FY03 budget proposal seek to eliminate \n     FEMA's post-disaster mitigation program, which was also \n     judged ineffective by OMB.\n       I believe that Mr. Brown and Director Allbaugh appreciate \n     the importance of disaster mitigation. Unfortunately, \n     traditional cost-benefit analysis is not appropriate for \n     mitigation and prevention programs, and OMB has not given \n     FEMA guidelines on what factors will be used in the future.\n       I am concerned that these same problems will haunt the new \n     Homeland Security Department. What factors will OMB use to \n     determine the effectiveness of different homeland security \n     programs? I hope Governor Ridge will shed some light on this \n     when he appears before us tomorrow.\n       The Deputy Director will be responsible to make sure that \n     core functions are not neglected. Over the past decade, FEMA \n     has regained the confidence of local and state emergency \n     managers. Individuals and families rely on FEMA when their \n     lives are torn apart by natural disasters. I believe \n     confidence and trust are among America's most important \n     assets in our struggle to make our communities safer and more \n     secure.\n       FEMA has these assets because of it employees. The Deputy \n     Director also will be responsible for ensuring that these \n     dedicated federal workers have the resources, training, and \n     support necessary to do their jobs. Likewise, FEMA's core \n     missions are too important to take the best and most \n     experienced staff away from traditional disaster response and \n     mitigation to fill new homeland security activities.\n       Mr. Brown, thank you again for your dedication and \n     willingness to serve your Nation. You have a tough road \n     ahead. If we are to use the parallel between this \n     reorganization and the creation of the Department of Defense \n     in 1947, we must remember that it took years, even decades, \n     to shape a truly integrated armed forces. Unfortunately, we \n     do not have years to reshape how our country prepares for \n     terrorism.\n       We can, and should, pass legislation to create a homeland \n     security department. However, we must remember that the issue \n     is not a new federal department, but what is most effective \n     in protecting Americans.\n                                  ____\n\n\n Non-Homeland Security Mission Performance Act of 2003, April 11, 2003\n\n       Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \n     preserve important non-homeland security missions in the \n     Department of Homeland Security. I am pleased to be joined by \n     the Senator from Delaware, Mr. Carper, and the Senator from \n     New Jersey, Mr. Lautenberg, in this effort to guarantee the \n     fulfillment of non-homeland security functions Americans rely \n     on daily.\n       Many of these non-homeland security functions are \n     especially important to the state of Hawaii. The Coast Guard \n     provides essential search and rescue, fisheries enforcement, \n     and protection of our coastline. The Animal and Plant Health \n     Inspection Service protects the state's fragile ecosystem \n     from invasive species. The Federal Emergency Management \n     Agency assists municipalities in reducing the destructive \n     effects of natural disasters, such as floods, hurricanes, and \n     tidal waves.\n       To preserve these vital functions, the ``Non-Homeland \n     Security Mission Performance Act of 2003'' would require the \n     Department of Homeland Security to identify and\n\n[[Page S9743]]\n\n     report to Congress on the resources, personnel, and \n     capabilities used to perform non-homeland security functions, \n     as well as the management strategy needed to carry out these \n     missions.\n       The measure would require the Department to include \n     information on the performance of these functions in its \n     annual performance report. Our legislation also calls for a \n     General Accounting Office (GAO) evaluation of the performance \n     of essential non-homeland security missions.\n       The establishment of the Department of Homeland Security \n     created additional management challenges and has fueled \n     growing concerns that the performance of core, non-homeland \n     security functions will slip through the cracks. Just last \n     week, the GAO testified before the House Committee on \n     Transportation and Infrastructure that the Coast Guard has \n     experienced a substantial decline in the amount of time spent \n     on core missions. Moreover, GAO found that the Coast Guard \n     lacks the resources to reverse this trend. Coast Guard \n     Commandant Thomas H. Collins is quoted as saying that his \n     agency has more business than it has resources and is \n     challenged like never before to do all that America wants it \n     to do.\n       These same concerns extend to the entire Department of \n     Homeland Security. The Department of Homeland Security's \n     Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration services provides \n     asylum for refugees and helps immigrants become American \n     citizens. The Customs Service protects and monitors foreign \n     trade so essential for a healthy American economy. And the \n     Secret Service protects and monitors against identity theft, \n     counterfeiting, and other financial crimes. In fact, the \n     General Accounting Office has added the transformation of and \n     implementation of the Department to the GAO High Risk list, \n     partially as the result of existing management challenges to \n     fulfill non-homeland security missions.\n       The cost of creating a Department of Homeland Security \n     should not come at the expense of these essential missions. \n     Agencies should strike the proper balance between new \n     homeland security responsibilities and their critical non-\n     homeland security missions. Enhancing traditional missions \n     also enhances domestic security which depends on sound \n     management strategies that ensure adequate resources and \n     personnel.\n       I urge my colleagues to support the ``Non-Homeland Security \n     Mission Performance Act of 2003.'' Our bill takes important \n     steps to ensure that Americans will not see a decline in non-\n     homeland security services as a result of the creation of the \n     Department of Homeland Security.\n       Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \n     bill be printed in the Record following this statement.\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I yield back my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, there are many things we do not yet know \nabout the Government's response to Hurricane Katrina, but two things \nare very clear: The Federal Government's response was unacceptable, and \nthe victims and all Americans deserve to know why.\n  Following 9/11, preparedness for national emergencies was supposed to \nbe a priority for our Government. Americans were made to believe that \nthe Government was doing everything it could to prepare for terrorist \nattacks, natural disasters, and national crises. Katrina makes it clear \nthat we failed. We must find out why, and we need to do it soon, to \nmake sure that devastation, such as caused by this hurricane, never \nhappens again, whether natural disaster or act of terrorists.\n  When we faced a similar situation after 9/11, Democrats and \nRepublicans came together and established an independent blue ribbon \ncommission. I am sad to see the Republicans now want a different \napproach. We don't know the details of their approach. I have been \ntalked to on a couple of occasions very lightly about having either \nchairmen, ranking members, and a few members from some of the \ncommittees to get together. It would be a joint task force of the House \nand the Senate.\n  I have great confidence in the Senate committee structure. The \nchairmen and the ranking members are where they are based on the rules \nof the Senate, something that is called seniority. Democrats do it a \nlittle differently than the Republicans, but it is still basically a \nseniority system. So that is why I have confidence in the HELP \nCommittee, with Mike Enzi from Wyoming, a fair man, and Ted Kennedy, \nthe ranking member, a fair man; also, Homeland Security with Susan \nCollins and Joe Lieberman.\n  I could go through the whole committee structure we have in the \nSenate. They do good work together, as indicated by what has been going \non in the Judiciary Committee with the relationship developed with \nSenator Specter and Senator Leahy. At a very difficult time in the \nhistory of our country, with two Supreme Court vacancies, they are \nworking their way through this. I do not think it is the time to invent \nsomething new.\n  Yesterday, the Republicans unveiled very briefly their proposal to \ninvestigate the events of last week. They called it a bipartisan \ncommission. I do not have the details of this--there are no details--\nbut what little I do know raises serious concerns about whether their \nproposal will provide Americans the answers they deserve.\n  I went through how Senate leadership is picked with the committees. \nThat is not how it works in the House anymore. I can remember being \nelected to the House of Representatives and meeting a wonderful man by \nthe name of Cliff Young, who served in the House a number of terms, a \nRepublican Congressman from Nevada. After leaving the House, he later \nserved more than 20 years in the Nevada State Senate, became the chief \njustice to the Nevada Supreme Court, and served there for more than two \ndecades. Cliff Young told me: Harry, when you come back to Washington \nin the House of Representatives, there are two things I want you to do. \nNo. 1, use the gym. You need to keep your body strong. And No. 2, do \nnot do anything to change the seniority system because in that large \nbody of 435, stability is needed. The one thing that gives that body \nstability is seniority.\n  That has been thrown out the window. Now the leadership in the House \non the committees wants whoever appears to be the nicest to the Speaker \nand to the majority leader. If they do anything wrong, boy, they are \nbooted out. We have examples of that. They would not even let Chris \nSmith from New Jersey have a subcommittee because he did not vote the \nway they wanted him to on a number of issues. He is gone. That is not \nwhat we need to be looking at after the disaster that took place in the \nGulf Coast.\n  What has been proposed is not bipartisan. It is like a baseball \nplayer saying, we have a great deal here. The game is going to move \nmore quickly and I think it will turn out pretty well. I am going to do \nthe pitching and I am also going to call the balls and strikes.\n  This is not the way we should do things. It may speed up the ball \ngame, but one does not get the results that are fair.\n  We have a Republican President, a Republican House, and a Republican \nSenate. We should not have the pitcher calling the balls and strikes. \nThe President has already said he is going to lead an investigation of \nwhat went wrong. On its face, that is flawed. It is flawed to try to \nchange what we are doing in regular order. It is wrong. We have a role \nfor committees. We have a committee structure in place to investigate.\n  I have had somebody ask, well, why should Secretary Chertoff have to \nappear at a committee in the House and then one in the Senate?\n  That is the way we do things around here. That is what oversight is \nall about. We have the ability to do things on a short-term basis under \nwhat we call regular order, have Congress itself, in its role in \noversight, do what is done in the ordinary course. We have seen what \nhappens when this administration investigates itself or any \nadministration investigates itself. It simply does not work.\n  There are serious concerns about this so-called Republican approach. \nThat is why Americans deserve answers independent of politics. That is \nwhy Democrats and Republicans preferred an independent commission for \ninvestigating 9/11. It took awhile before the President signed on to \nit, but when he finally did, we got great people such as Hamilton and \nKean. They did a wonderful job as the chairmen of this 9/11 Commission. \nThey came up with facts that have been supported. They spent a\n\n[[Page S9744]]\n\nyear with a staff that was adequate to come up with what went wrong on \n9/11.\n  We are ultimately going to have an independent bipartisan commission \nto study what went wrong with the Government's response to Katrina. \nThere is no question about that. So we should move that along and get \nit done as quickly as possible. In the meantime, have the committees of \njurisdiction in the House and the Senate do what they are obligated to \ndo by virtue of their role in history.\n  I would hope that on this issue we can move forward on a bipartisan \nbasis. If we use the model of the 9/11 Commission, the majority still \ngets the edge because with 9/11 what happened is the President picked \nthe chair. As it turned out, the Republicans had one more vote on the \ncommission than did the Democrats, but it worked out OK. While that may \nnot be perfect, it is certainly more perfect than this very awkward \npresentation that has been made in the last 24 hours about this so-\ncalled bipartisan commission. That is Orwellian. That is not \nbipartisan.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I echo some of the remarks the Democratic \nleader made. I am about to leave this Chamber to go to a behind-closed-\ndoors hearing of the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs with the acting director of operations for FEMA and the \nCommandant of the Coast Guard. I am told that the chairman of the \ncommittee, the distinguished Senator from Maine, and the ranking member \nfrom Connecticut tried to get this hearing in public but that the \nadministration officials would not appear in a public session. I think \nthe public deserves to and would benefit from hearing these people with \nkey roles in this recovery effort.\n  Similarly, on Tuesday evening, a majority of us in the Senate met \nwith 10 members of the Cabinet, 10 Secretaries--all of them had \nimportant things to say--as well as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff and the head of the Coast Guard. That briefing should have been \nin a public setting. There was not a single remark made by anyone that \nwas not unclassified and should not have been available to all of the \npeople of this country, certainly those who are most beleaguered, who \nare looking for answers to the questions that the Democratic leader and \nothers on both sides of the aisle have raised.\n  We had a brief time for questions. We were not able to ask those \nquestions of the administration officials in a public setting before \nthe American people. Yet the President is coming forth now with a \nsecond request for funding, $51.8 billion on top of the $10.5 billion \nthe Senate and the House passed last week. These matters are moving \nswiftly. We are told by FEMA that the burn rate--only in the Federal \nGovernment would the spending of taxpayer money of $2 billion a day be \ncalled a burn rate, but the FEMA director has said they are spending $2 \nbillion a day. That is why we have to have a second supplemental before \nthis body in less than 2 weeks.\n  I understand the need to move quickly, but I have been in this body \nall week. We could have come back last week. We have not had a single \npublic hearing on any of these matters, I am told, because the \nadministration officials will not appear in public before these \ncommittees to answer questions before us and before the American \npeople. I find that to be unacceptable.\n  The administration has a responsibility to come before us in public \nhearings and public sessions and present their testimony but then \nanswer our questions. Give us a chance to ask and for them to answer \nthe questions that are on the minds of millions of Americans these \ndays. We have a right to public hearings before we expend another $51.8 \nbillion of public money.\n  The administration has that responsibility, I believe, and I ask that \nthe distinguished majority leader of the Senate insist in his \ndiscussions with the administration--and I am quite confident that the \nDemocratic leader and all of our caucus would support this--that these \nhearings and briefings be in public settings before the American people \nand not behind closed doors. If we are going to work together in a \nbipartisan way, let us do so. Let us begin that work now in public \nsessions. I challenge the administration officials to come before us in \nthose settings.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeMint). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, what is the regular order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 14 minutes remaining in morning \nbusiness under the control of the majority.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/08/senate-section/article/S9744-2", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9744-S9745]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EMERGENCY FUNDING\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, we will sometime later today be getting a \nsupplemental request in the Senate to continue to fund the needs of the \nrelief effort in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama, which will be \napproximately $50 billion on top of the $10 billion that has already \nbeen spent. Obviously, it is essential that we get these dollars down \nthere and put them to use aggressively in order to try to help the \npeople who are in such dire straits, and to try to begin to bring some \norder and some relief to those who have suffered so much.\n  As we proceed in this effort, we should err on the side of making \nsure that we get the dollars there quickly in order to support these \nindividuals who are in such dire straits, and to try to assist this \npart of the country that has been hit by this catastrophic event.\n  But in the process, I think it is important that we have some fiscal \noversight that allows us to feel comfortable that the dollars that are \nbeing spent are going effectively, quickly, and aggressively to relief \nefforts which are legitimate and appropriate.\n  Thus, I congratulate the House of Representatives for putting in the \nsupplemental and identifying within the supplemental $15 million which \nwill be assigned to the Inspector General's Office to start to put in \nplace the auditing process and the oversight process on how the money \nis being spent, which I believe is critical.\n  We have seen some issues which obviously, if they are pursued \nlogically, make sense. But if they are pursued in a way that is not \nlogical, they are going to cost us a lot of money and probably not get \nus a lot of relief.\n  For example, there was a report in my State paper which said that all \nthe dealerships who sell Winnebagos in New Hampshire have been \ncontacted and told to get ready to transfer their entire inventory over \nto the Federal Government because they are going to ship it all out. \nMaybe that is what we will end up doing, but we hope before we buy up \nall the Winnebagos in America and send them to the gulf coast, we would \nbe thinking about the cost and how we are going to approach that and \nwhether that is the best way to proceed.\n  There are a lot of ideas floating out there. I think it is important \nwe have the structure in place that effectively monitors cost and how \nthe money is being spent. So I congratulate the House.\n  In addition, I think the President's decision, along with the Vice \nPresident, to have the Vice President physically going there and being \non the ground in that region is a very positive step in our efforts to \nget order in the process of delivering relief.\n  Anybody who knows the Vice President--and I have had the good fortune \nto serve with him in the House and fortunate to serve with him here \nwhile he has been Vice President--will note that he is a no-nonsense \nindividual. He looks at an issue, decides how to get the best results \nfor resolving the problem, and moves forward. He did that as Defense \nSecretary. He has done it, obviously, as Vice President. He will bring \nimmediate coherence, intelligence, and aggressive action in solving the \nproblem and will move forward with the complexities of this \nreconstruction and relief effort. I think it is an excellent decision \nto have the Vice President step into the middle of this effort and \nbasically try to calm the waters, but more importantly execute \nefficiently what is going on in the area of the Federal relief effort. \nHowever, it does lead to the point I made earlier--\n\n[[Page S9745]]\n\nand which I want to stress once again--which is that this is not an \novernight, 2- or 3-month exercise. We all realize that rebuilding this \nregion is going to take a significant amount of time and a tremendous \namount of resources and a lot of thought and an intelligent process.\n  We need to set up, I believe as we move forward--obviously, not \nwithin the next few days but certainly within the next month--some type \nof structured commission along the lines I would suggest as was done \nafter the horrific floods of 1926 when Herbert Hoover led the effort, \nwhere you basically have a central focal point with an individual of \ngreat ability and national recognition leading the effort, and \nbasically manage the Federal dollars as they come in from all the \nvarious Federal agencies that will be impacted, and make sure those \nFederal dollars are effectively, efficiently, and quickly brought to \nbear on the problems in concert with the State and local governments.\n  I believe that is going to take a separate type of entity to be \ncreated. I think we should be thinking about how to structure that \nentity. I would certainly be looking to people such as Senator Cochran, \nSenator Lott, Senator Shelby, Senator Sessions, and the Senators from \nLouisiana, Ms. Landrieu and Mr. Vitter, for ideas about how we should \nset that up. We should be starting the process.\n  I wanted to come to the floor and say, as we move forward on this \nsupplemental--obviously, it is totally outside of the budget. It is an \nemergency, and that is the way it should be done, but it is $50 \nbillion--it is important that we retain this language--and I guess we \nwill try to move this supplemental through the Senate without \namendment--retain this language which makes sure that the Inspector \nGeneral has the resources the office needs in order to effectively \nmonitor how these funds are managed; to make sure we are getting the \nbest return in the most prompt way for these tax dollars which are in \nsuch dire need down there in order to pursue the reconstruction and \nrelief effort.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

(a) Tracing studies conducted by the Bureau of \n     Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are released \n     without adequate disclaimers regarding the limitations of the \n     data.\n       (b) The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives \n     shall include in all such data releases, language similar to \n     the following that would make clear that trace data cannot be \n     used to draw broad conclusions about firearms-related crime:\n       (1) Firearm traces are designed to assist law enforcement \n     authorities in conducting investigations by tracking the sale \n     and possession of specific firearms. Law enforcement agencies \n     may request firearms traces for any reason, and those reasons \n     are not necessarily reported to the Federal Government. Not \n     all firearms used in crime are traced and not all firearms \n     traced are used in crime.\n       (2) Firearms selected for tracing are not chosen for \n     purposes of determining which types, makes or models of \n     firearms are used for illicit purposes. The firearms selected \n     do not constitute a random sample and should not be \n     considered representative of the larger universe of all \n     firearms used by criminals, or any subset of that universe. \n     Firearms are normally traced to the first retail seller, and \n     sources reported for firearms traced do not necessarily \n     represent the sources or methods by which firearms in general \n     are acquired for use in crime.\n\n                         TITLE VI--RESCISSIONS\n\n                         DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE\n\n                         General Administration\n\n\n                         counterterrorism fund\n\n                              (rescission)\n\n       Of the unobligated balances available under this heading, \n     $11,000,000 are rescinded.\n\n                            Legal Activities\n\n\n                         assets forfeiture fund\n\n                              (rescission)\n\n       Of the unobligated balances available under this heading, \n     $82,000,000 are rescinded.\n\n                    Federal Bureau of Investigation\n\n\n                         salaries and expenses\n\n                              (rescission)\n\n       Of the unobligated balances available under this heading, \n     $103,502,000 are rescinded; of which $30,000,000 shall be \n     from funding for J. Edgar Hoover Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation Building tours; and of which $73,502,000 shall \n     be from funding for the Federal Bureau of Investigation's \n     failed computer modernization program.\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Departments of Commerce and \n     Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, \n     2006''.\n       Amend the title so as to read: ``An Act making \n     appropriations for the Departments of Commerce and Justice, \n     Science, and related agencies, for the fiscal year ending \n     September 30, 2006, and for other purposes.''.\n\n  The committee amendment in the nature of a substitute was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, on behalf of the distinguished chairman \nof the Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies \nof the Senate Appropriations Committee, Mr. Shelby, I am pleased to \npresent to the Senate the appropriations bill written by the \nsubcommittee for fiscal year 2006.\n  Senators Shelby and Mikulski have done an outstanding job producing \nthis bill at a time when discretionary dollars are scarce. The \nsubcommittee chairman and ranking member have had to make many \ndifficult decisions on issues that were presented during the writing of \nthis bill.\n  The consideration of the bill also comes at a time when we have \nwitnessed a terrible tragedy in the gulf coast region of our Nation. \nThe entire region, including specifically Alabama, Louisiana, \nMississippi, and other areas have suffered serious damages, the loss of \nlives and livelihoods.\n  This bill provides funding for many Government functions and programs \nthat are important to hurricane prediction, response, and recovery. \nSmall Business Administration disaster loans, Economic Development \nAdministration public works grants, and State and local law enforcement \nassistance grants are a few examples of programs contained in the bill \nthat can help disaster victims in the short run.\n  We do need immediate assistance available, and these funds will \nbecome available at the beginning of the fiscal year, starting October \n1.\n  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is a major agency \ninvolved in researching, forecasting, monitoring, and warning of \nhurricanes. Funding for that agency is included in this bill.\n  But this bill also reflects a commitment to responsibility in holding \ndown the level of spending at a time when we see the Federal Government \nbuilding up deficits that some worry threaten the economic livelihood \nand growth potential of our economy. So this is a lean bill. Senator \nShelby and Senator Mikulski have had to refuse to include in the bill a \nlot of requested projects for funding. These are difficult decisions \nbecause the needs are real and many are very meritorious. But I think \nSenators will find this bill supports the functions and \nresponsibilities of the agencies and the Departments that are funded in \nthe bill. There are increases provided where those increases are \nnecessary and important to include.\n  The bill is within the 302(b) allocation of the Budget Act, and the \ntotal amount recommended in the bill is $885 million above the fiscal \nyear 2005 level. This is a 2-percent increase over last year's level of \nspending.\n  The bill includes an increase of over $1 billion above the \nPresident's budget request for the Department of Justice. This is \nprimarily due to the restoration of the proposed cuts to State and \nlocal law enforcement grant programs. I am sure the funds will be \nhelpful and important in the discharge of those responsibilities at the \nlocal level throughout the country.\n  The bill recommends nearly $7.2 billion for the Department of \nCommerce, including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration \nand the National Institute of Standards Technology, which is an 8-\npercent increase over last year's level of funding. This part of the \nbill is particularly important because it provides funding for \nhurricane prediction and warning, including the National Data Buoy \nCenter which provides data from the oceans to help assess the strength \nand speed of hurricanes.\n  The bill also provides funding for NASA, the National Aeronautics and \nSpace Administration, to move forward with the exploration vision, \nwhile fully funding activities of the space shuttle and the \nInternational Space Station.\n  In the related agencies title of the bill, funding is included for \nthe Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Communications \nCommission.\n  The bill also addresses very important needs that were brought to the \nattention of the committee during hearings by both the administration \nand other Senators. Overall, the subcommittee chairman and ranking \nmember have crafted a bill that reflects the committee's and the \nSenate's priorities as well as those of the administration.\n  I hope Senators will support the bill. And we hope we can complete \naction on it today.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I come to the floor as the ranking member of this very brandnew \nsubcommittee called Commerce, Justice, and Science. As the Presiding \nOfficer knows, and our colleagues remember, the Appropriations \nCommittee reorganized itself, and I had been the ranking member of a \nsubcommittee called VA-HUD and Independent Agencies. It exists no more. \nBut now we have Commerce, Justice, and Science, which we think is an \noutstanding subcommittee, funding the important agencies related to \nmaking us a safer, stronger, smarter, more innovative country.\n  Originally, I anticipated our bill would come up today with such \nenthusiasm and such joy in working with my colleague, Senator Shelby, \nwhom I served with in the House, that we would work together on a \nbipartisan basis to fashion the bill, but on its way to the floor a \ngreat national tragedy occurred with Hurricane Katrina.\n  I want to say here today on the floor to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Mississippi, who has just spoken, Mr. Cochran, the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, first of all, know that you can count on me \nfor full support to move all appropriate legislation to help the people \nof our gulf coast. I know the distinguished Senator is from a wonderful \nState with a great heritage and is a great contributor to our economy. \nAnd we know his State has been hit hard. We watched him tour the hit \nzones.\n  This is a time we all do work together. I know all of our colleagues \nare so proud of the rescue workers who are going to continue to rescue \npeople throughout the gulf coast region. Our hearts and prayers and \nthoughts go out\n\n[[Page S9769]]\n\nto the families who have lost everything in this terrible tragedy.\n  At the same time, we acknowledge the tremendous role of scores of \nNational Guard soldiers, our Coast Guard rescuers, those Navy guys who \nrescued 110 people--and they might have gotten a reprimand from their \ncommander, but they would certainly get a hug and kiss from this \nSenator for what they did--and the doctors and nurses and the \nparamedics and all the first responders and law enforcement. Everybody \nwho is out there working a 36-hour day, we thank you and we salute you.\n  As of Monday, there have been so many who have been rescued, shelters \nthat have been opened, and hot meals being served. Also, under the \ndoctrine of mutual assistance, other States have opened their doors--\nTexas, Arkansas. My own State of Maryland has sent tremendous help and \nsupport. So we all need to pull together now.\n  I am glad the press has stopped calling those people who have lost \neverything refugees. ``Refugee'' is an honorable title, but this is not \n``Hotel Rwanda.'' This is the United States of America. All those \npeople are our citizens. They have been evacuated, but they have a home \nto go back to. And they have another home called the United States of \nAmerica, where every State, every city would have an open door toward \nthem. They have not lost their home. They have not lost their homeland. \nAnd they cannot lose their way.\n  In my own home State, we have sent people down to rescue people--\nfirst responders. Governor Ehrlich sent our National Guard. We are so \nproud of the hospital ship, the USS Comfort, that is steaming down \nheading toward the coast of New Orleans. But whether it has been first \nresponders, local law enforcement, charitable aid from the nonprofits \nand faith-based organizations, they all wanted to offer a contribution.\n  But we cannot do this on philanthropic activity alone. We cannot do \nthis with just good will. And to be sure, eventually fatigue will set \nin. But the U.S. Federal Government must be tireless. It must be \nresponsive. It is critical we approve the Commerce, Justice, Science \nappropriations bill quickly. The distinguished Senator from Mississippi \nhas outlined this bill.\n  This bill provides a downpayment for the victims of Katrina to \nrebuild their lives and communities. We know a supplemental is coming, \nand we will work expeditiously on a bipartisan basis to also help. We \nwill not play politics with the lives of our citizens and with all of \nthose who are conducting the rescue and cleanup.\n  There are some important things in this bill that can be of specific \nand immediate help. One is the Small Business Administration's disaster \nloan program. It is not just for business, it is for families. SBA \nprovides low-interest loans of up to $200,000 to repair damaged \nproperty to primary residences, and up to $40,000 for personal \nproperty.\n  SBA provides low-interest loans to businesses and nonprofits of up to \n$1.5 million to repair damage to their real estate, machinery, \nequipment, and inventory. So SBA will not only help businesses become \nbusinesses again, but it will help families be able to get their home \ngoing again. And for all those nonprofits that will be there when the \nTV cameras leave, this will also help them get on their feet.\n  Another area where we will be very helpful is in the area of the \nEconomic Development Administration. This is in the Commerce \nDepartment. It provides grants to State and local governments for \ninfrastructure repair and modernization. And, boy, do they do that. \nRoads need to be built, and not only the great Federal highways, but \nthose blue highways that make our rural areas so great and provide a \nlivelihood to those communities.\n  Economic development assistance money can help recover from sudden \nand severe dislocation. This bill includes $315 million for EDA, and we \npresume that in the supplemental this could be a very specific line \nitem that would not get lost in big bureaucracy.\n  We want to provide assistance in the Department of Justice to our \nState and local police. They provide the safety and security of first \nchoice so we want to make sure that they are supported. They themselves \nhave lost police stations. They have lost their equipment. They have \nlost their homes. We need to be able to help them.\n  While we also are repairing the damage, we need to look ahead and be \nsure we can always give the best predictions possible so people can get \nout of harm's way. This bill funds the National Weather Service. It is \na branch of NOAA, and it has already done a great job of predicting \nhurricanes, storms, flooding, and tornadoes. But we want to bring even \nmore innovation to them and more resources so they can predict not only \nhurricanes but any other natural disaster coming to a community so that \nwe can prevent loss of life and secure property. Those are some of the \nthings that can be focused immediately on Katrina and future \nprevention. As we know, there are some hurricanes gathering with names \nlike Ophelia off the coast now. That is what we can do.\n  At the same time, Senator Shelby and I, taking our new charge very \nseriously, said we wanted to work together to build a safer, stronger, \nsmarter America. So we concentrated on the Department of Justice to \nmake this a safer country. What we then did was look at the agencies \nwithin our portfolio, the FBI, Drug Enforcement, the U.S. Marshals \nService, as well as alcohol and firearms. We know that the Department \nof Justice protects us from terrorists and protects our neighborhoods \nand communities. They protect us against those who have a predatory \nintent against our country, the terrorists, but it also protects our \nchildren against sexual predators. We want to salute President Bush and \nAttorney General Gonzales for developing a specific watch list for the \nregistration of sexual predators. It has given a wake-up call to all \nStates. Predatory behavior doesn't go in our country.\n  The Department of Justice accounts for almost 50 percent of our \nentire bill. The FBI is the lead agency. It will receive $5.3 billion, \na $100 million increase, so that they can continue to fight organized \nterrorism and organized crime as well. We have given the FBI a record \namount to do that. We look forward to working with them to correct some \nof their problems in technology, and we know they are improving their \nmanagement. At the same time, we thank them for focusing, No. 1, on \nprotecting our children through the Missing and Exploited Children's \nProgram, which, by the way, the Missing and Exploited Children's \nProgram is now going to be used to help locate over 100 to 1,000 \nchildren, where their parents don't know where they are. We are going \nto find those children, and we are going to bring them back to their \nparents one way or another.\n  Working together with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, \nwe want to make sure they have the resources to protect us against \narson, street crime, and gangs that are now menacing our communities. \nWe thank them for the outstanding job that the ATF arson laboratory did \nin Maryland. It identified the DC serial arsonist that burned down \nhomes in Charles County. It also provided the ballistic laboratory that \nhelped to solve the DC sniper case. Our law enforcement is on the job, \nand they are protecting us every day. We have tried to protect them in \nthe Federal budget so that they can do their job.\n  At the same time, while we are doing law enforcement, we look at \ncommerce and science. This is where we talk about building a stronger \neconomy and a smarter America. We do all we can to fund the programs in \nthe Commerce Department. One of our most important places, though, is \nwhere we protect our intellectual property. As we are working to \nprotect our citizens, we have to protect what our citizens invent. We \nare the country of discovery, of innovation, of invention. If you \ninvented it, we think you ought to be able to keep it. We, therefore, \nprovided $1.7 billion for the Patent and Trademark Office. It is a \nrecord amount that should help them reduce their backlog of patent \napplications and help us make sure we secure those new ideas that are \ngoing to create the new jobs right here in the United States.\n  We are also supporting our great Federal laboratories that help come \nup with the new ideas and set the standards for products so they can go \nto the marketplace. That is the National Institute of Standards and \nTechnology located in Maryland. It sets standards that are critical to \nsuccessful commerce and, because of what they do,\n\n[[Page S9770]]\n\ntransfers technology to the American business community.\n  The bill fully funds the Advanced Tech Program and the Manufacturing \nExtension Program which are important to fostering competitiveness. In \nscience, we have NOAA, which I have spoken about, which does fantastic \nwork on weather prediction, saving lives, and saving communities \nthrough their predictions. But at the same time, they do fantastic \nresearch on our oceans, on our bays and so on. We know that we are \ngoing to face, because of Katrina, a real impact on oysters and clams \nand shrimp on the gulf coast. What are the ideas to be able to help out \nand restore the bays that produce those delicious morsels but that are \nso important to the economy and to little people who have names like \nwatermen and fishermen and seafood? This is what we are challenging \nNOAA to do, continue their great research. But we need immediate and \npractical solutions to protect the seafood industry on the gulf coast.\n\n  Then there is NASA. Originally, we thought the only risky operation \nwas going to be the Hubble telescope. Now we have human need pressing \nus, and we are going to meet that need. For NASA, we have provided \n$16.4 billion, a $200 million increase over last year. This does \ninclude the money for the Hubble servicing mission. We are going to \nprovide full funding for the space shuttle, for the space station, and \nwork with Dr. Griffin on the new Crew Exploration Vehicle.\n  Because of Katrina, we know two major NASA facilities were heavily \ndamaged. One was the Michoud assembly facility in New Orleans. The \nother was the Stennis facility in Mississippi. This is everything from \nshipyards to spaceships, from Navy ships to spaceships. We know those \nfacilities suffered tremendous damage, and 50 percent of the employees \nlost their homes. We expect the administration and the agencies to tell \nus what happened to those employees and how we can help them.\n  On the bright side, we are so happy about the successful mission of \nDiscovery last month. Weren't we proud of Colonel Collins and that \ndaring-do, can-do crew that got out there and did the kind of repair \nwork that had never been done in space, showed our courage and our \ntenacity and our technological capability. We want to support them. We \nknow they want to return to space. The shuttle tanks were to be \nprepared in New Orleans. We are going to have to make adjustments. But \nthen again, everybody is making adjustments, and we are all going to \nwork together. The National Science Foundation is also in here. Just \nthink what the Committee on Science is--NIST, NOAA, NASA, the Science \nFoundation. These are the new ideas. It is going to help with funding \nfor important research in new ideas in basic science like physics and \nalso breakthrough things again for new jobs like biotech and nanotech.\n  One of the important things we did was preserve the funding for \nhistorically Black colleges and universities. This is also coming at a \nvery important time. Louisiana, I believe the entire gulf, was the home \nof 28 colleges and universities that were affected by Katrina. \nHistorically Black colleges all over America, such as Morgan State in \nmy hometown, are accepting the young men and women from the \nhistorically Black colleges of the gulf coast. They are accepting them \nand not asking questions about tuition and other things. This is a way \nof also being of help. So we are all pitching in together.\n  One of the flashing yellow lights in the bill is the census. Because \nof staying within our 302(b) allocation, we funded the Census Bureau \nwith $17 million below last year's level and $150 million below the \nPresident's request. The census is important. They don't just do \nsomething every 10 years where they knock on your door and give you a \ncomplicated form. It continually evaluates who we are and where we live \nand gives us important information so that communities and businesses \ncan develop everything from transportation and education plans to \nbusiness targeting the new demography in our country. We are proud of \nthe civil servants that work in Maryland, and we look forward to \nlooking at how we can restore funding. When we looked at our \npriorities, we thought Census could do without an increase and even a \nvery modest $17 million cut. We hope to restore that in conference. But \nwhen we looked at all that we needed to do in Justice and all that we \nneeded to do, particularly in agencies such as the FBI, we felt that \nthese were our priorities. Now that Katrina has hit us, we will be \nreevaluating as we go along.\n  That is our bill. We are proud of our bill because we have tried to \nfocus on where America is today and where America needs to go tomorrow. \nWe tried to look at the day-to-day needs of our constituents and know \nthat they needed to be protected in their local communities. That is \nwhy we looked at local law enforcement. We know that we face predatory \nassault from everything from organized crime to organized terrorists. \nWe focused on our Justice Department, but also on our science and on \nour commerce for new ideas, for new products and invention, but also to \nfund those agencies that help them protect their intellectual property \nagainst often international predators and also come up with those new \nideas.\n  Along the way, Katrina has happened. We are going to make sure this \nbill serves the needs now, the immediate needs of our neighbors in the \ngulf and those States that have been so kind and so generous and \nwelcoming. We view this bill as a work in progress, but work it will \nbe, and progress we will make. We are going to work together.\n  These are not refugees. They are evacuees, as our Senators are. We \nneed to remember all of the people who have been affected. We are one \nnation, under God, and we are indivisible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am impressed with the comprehensive \nstatement made by the distinguished Senator from Maryland, describing \nthe provisions of this bill that have been prepared and are being \npresented today to the Senate by her subcommittee. Her comments and the \ntone that she has set reflects so well on the Senate. It also reflects \na bipartisanship that is so important to the writing of this bill. This \nis not a Republican bill nor a Democratic bill. It is a bill that \nreflects a consensus of the members of the subcommittee and also \nrespect for the requests being made by the administration for funding \nof these agencies and departments for the next fiscal year.\n  We have all had what some might say is a wake-up call about hurricane \nwarnings, mobilization of State and local resources, and relocation of \npeople who are threatened by the ravages of storms such as Katrina. \nThis bill is designed to meet the challenge that is so fresh in our \nminds. It can be presented to Government officials, private \nindividuals, and businesses as we seek to protect our families and our \nproperty and our lives from the threats hurricanes and other storms \nmight pose. It also reflects, as the distinguished Senator pointed out, \nfunding that provides the resources we need for law-and-order \nactivities, crime prevention, and investigations to ensure we are doing \nwhat has to be done to protect the security of our country.\n  I know of no more important bill that will come before the Senate \nthis year from our committee than the one being presented today by \nSenators Shelby and Mikulski. They have done a wonderful job working \ntogether. They have set an example by which we could all profit.\n  We need to act expeditiously on the bill, consider any amendments \nthat any Senator has to add money or delete funding that is contained \nin the bill. We assure everyone that we want to act in a thoughtful way \nand one that will reflect credit on the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for \napproximately 30 minutes, perhaps more.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S9771]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/08/senate-section/article/S9745-2", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9745-S9771]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n MAKING APPROPRIATIONS FOR SCIENCE, THE DEPARTMENTS OF STATE, JUSTICE, \n        AND COMMERCE, AND RELATED AGENCIES FOR FISCAL YEAR 2006\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Law enforcement agencies \n     may request firearms traces for any reason, and those reasons \n     are not necessarily reported to the Federal Government.

The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, on behalf of the distinguished chairman \nof the Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies \nof the Senate Appropriations Committee, Mr. Shelby, I am pleased to \npresent to the Senate the appropriations bill written by the \nsubcommittee for fiscal year 2006.\n  Senators Shelby and Mikulski have done an outstanding job producing \nthis bill at a time when discretionary dollars are scarce. The \nsubcommittee chairman and ranking member have had to make many \ndifficult decisions on issues that were presented during the writing of \nthis bill.\n  The consideration of the bill also comes at a time when we have \nwitnessed a terrible tragedy in the gulf coast region of our Nation. \nThe entire region, including specifically Alabama, Louisiana, \nMississippi, and other areas have suffered serious damages, the loss of \nlives and livelihoods.\n  This bill provides funding for many Government functions and programs \nthat are important to hurricane prediction, response, and recovery. \nSmall Business Administration disaster loans, Economic Development \nAdministration public works grants, and State and local law enforcement \nassistance grants are a few examples of programs contained in the bill \nthat can help disaster victims in the short run.\n  We do need immediate assistance available, and these funds will \nbecome available at the beginning of the fiscal year, starting October \n1.\n  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is a major agency \ninvolved in researching, forecasting, monitoring, and warning of \nhurricanes. Funding for that agency is included in this bill.\n  But this bill also reflects a commitment to responsibility in holding \ndown the level of spending at a time when we see the Federal Government \nbuilding up deficits that some worry threaten the economic livelihood \nand growth potential of our economy. So this is a lean bill. Senator \nShelby and Senator Mikulski have had to refuse to include in the bill a \nlot of requested projects for funding. These are difficult decisions \nbecause the needs are real and many are very meritorious. But I think \nSenators will find this bill supports the functions and \nresponsibilities of the agencies and the Departments that are funded in \nthe bill. There are increases provided where those increases are \nnecessary and important to include.\n  The bill is within the 302(b) allocation of the Budget Act, and the \ntotal amount recommended in the bill is $885 million above the fiscal \nyear 2005 level. This is a 2-percent increase over last year's level of \nspending.\n  The bill includes an increase of over $1 billion above the \nPresident's budget request for the Department of Justice. This is \nprimarily due to the restoration of the proposed cuts to State and \nlocal law enforcement grant programs. I am sure the funds will be \nhelpful and important in the discharge of those responsibilities at the \nlocal level throughout the country.\n  The bill recommends nearly $7.2 billion for the Department of \nCommerce, including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration \nand the National Institute of Standards Technology, which is an 8-\npercent increase over last year's level of funding. This part of the \nbill is particularly important because it provides funding for \nhurricane prediction and warning, including the National Data Buoy \nCenter which provides data from the oceans to help assess the strength \nand speed of hurricanes.\n  The bill also provides funding for NASA, the National Aeronautics and \nSpace Administration, to move forward with the exploration vision, \nwhile fully funding activities of the space shuttle and the \nInternational Space Station.\n  In the related agencies title of the bill, funding is included for \nthe Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Communications \nCommission.\n  The bill also addresses very important needs that were brought to the \nattention of the committee during hearings by both the administration \nand other Senators. Overall, the subcommittee chairman and ranking \nmember have crafted a bill that reflects the committee's and the \nSenate's priorities as well as those of the administration.\n  I hope Senators will support the bill. And we hope we can complete \naction on it today.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I come to the floor as the ranking member of this very brandnew \nsubcommittee called Commerce, Justice, and Science. As the Presiding \nOfficer knows, and our colleagues remember, the Appropriations \nCommittee reorganized itself, and I had been the ranking member of a \nsubcommittee called VA-HUD and Independent Agencies. It exists no more. \nBut now we have Commerce, Justice, and Science, which we think is an \noutstanding subcommittee, funding the important agencies related to \nmaking us a safer, stronger, smarter, more innovative country.\n  Originally, I anticipated our bill would come up today with such \nenthusiasm and such joy in working with my colleague, Senator Shelby, \nwhom I served with in the House, that we would work together on a \nbipartisan basis to fashion the bill, but on its way to the floor a \ngreat national tragedy occurred with Hurricane Katrina.\n  I want to say here today on the floor to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Mississippi, who has just spoken, Mr. Cochran, the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, first of all, know that you can count on me \nfor full support to move all appropriate legislation to help the people \nof our gulf coast. I know the distinguished Senator is from a wonderful \nState with a great heritage and is a great contributor to our economy. \nAnd we know his State has been hit hard. We watched him tour the hit \nzones.\n  This is a time we all do work together. I know all of our colleagues \nare so proud of the rescue workers who are going to continue to rescue \npeople throughout the gulf coast region. Our hearts and prayers and \nthoughts go out\n\n[[Page S9769]]\n\nto the families who have lost everything in this terrible tragedy.\n  At the same time, we acknowledge the tremendous role of scores of \nNational Guard soldiers, our Coast Guard rescuers, those Navy guys who \nrescued 110 people--and they might have gotten a reprimand from their \ncommander, but they would certainly get a hug and kiss from this \nSenator for what they did--and the doctors and nurses and the \nparamedics and all the first responders and law enforcement. Everybody \nwho is out there working a 36-hour day, we thank you and we salute you.\n  As of Monday, there have been so many who have been rescued, shelters \nthat have been opened, and hot meals being served. Also, under the \ndoctrine of mutual assistance, other States have opened their doors--\nTexas, Arkansas. My own State of Maryland has sent tremendous help and \nsupport. So we all need to pull together now.\n  I am glad the press has stopped calling those people who have lost \neverything refugees. ``Refugee'' is an honorable title, but this is not \n``Hotel Rwanda.'' This is the United States of America. All those \npeople are our citizens. They have been evacuated, but they have a home \nto go back to. And they have another home called the United States of \nAmerica, where every State, every city would have an open door toward \nthem. They have not lost their home. They have not lost their homeland. \nAnd they cannot lose their way.\n  In my own home State, we have sent people down to rescue people--\nfirst responders. Governor Ehrlich sent our National Guard. We are so \nproud of the hospital ship, the USS Comfort, that is steaming down \nheading toward the coast of New Orleans. But whether it has been first \nresponders, local law enforcement, charitable aid from the nonprofits \nand faith-based organizations, they all wanted to offer a contribution.\n  But we cannot do this on philanthropic activity alone. We cannot do \nthis with just good will. And to be sure, eventually fatigue will set \nin. But the U.S. Federal Government must be tireless. It must be \nresponsive. It is critical we approve the Commerce, Justice, Science \nappropriations bill quickly. The distinguished Senator from Mississippi \nhas outlined this bill.\n  This bill provides a downpayment for the victims of Katrina to \nrebuild their lives and communities. We know a supplemental is coming, \nand we will work expeditiously on a bipartisan basis to also help. We \nwill not play politics with the lives of our citizens and with all of \nthose who are conducting the rescue and cleanup.\n  There are some important things in this bill that can be of specific \nand immediate help. One is the Small Business Administration's disaster \nloan program. It is not just for business, it is for families. SBA \nprovides low-interest loans of up to $200,000 to repair damaged \nproperty to primary residences, and up to $40,000 for personal \nproperty.\n  SBA provides low-interest loans to businesses and nonprofits of up to \n$1.5 million to repair damage to their real estate, machinery, \nequipment, and inventory. So SBA will not only help businesses become \nbusinesses again, but it will help families be able to get their home \ngoing again. And for all those nonprofits that will be there when the \nTV cameras leave, this will also help them get on their feet.\n  Another area where we will be very helpful is in the area of the \nEconomic Development Administration. This is in the Commerce \nDepartment. It provides grants to State and local governments for \ninfrastructure repair and modernization. And, boy, do they do that. \nRoads need to be built, and not only the great Federal highways, but \nthose blue highways that make our rural areas so great and provide a \nlivelihood to those communities.\n  Economic development assistance money can help recover from sudden \nand severe dislocation. This bill includes $315 million for EDA, and we \npresume that in the supplemental this could be a very specific line \nitem that would not get lost in big bureaucracy.\n  We want to provide assistance in the Department of Justice to our \nState and local police. They provide the safety and security of first \nchoice so we want to make sure that they are supported. They themselves \nhave lost police stations. They have lost their equipment. They have \nlost their homes. We need to be able to help them.\n  While we also are repairing the damage, we need to look ahead and be \nsure we can always give the best predictions possible so people can get \nout of harm's way. This bill funds the National Weather Service. It is \na branch of NOAA, and it has already done a great job of predicting \nhurricanes, storms, flooding, and tornadoes. But we want to bring even \nmore innovation to them and more resources so they can predict not only \nhurricanes but any other natural disaster coming to a community so that \nwe can prevent loss of life and secure property. Those are some of the \nthings that can be focused immediately on Katrina and future \nprevention. As we know, there are some hurricanes gathering with names \nlike Ophelia off the coast now. That is what we can do.\n  At the same time, Senator Shelby and I, taking our new charge very \nseriously, said we wanted to work together to build a safer, stronger, \nsmarter America. So we concentrated on the Department of Justice to \nmake this a safer country. What we then did was look at the agencies \nwithin our portfolio, the FBI, Drug Enforcement, the U.S. Marshals \nService, as well as alcohol and firearms. We know that the Department \nof Justice protects us from terrorists and protects our neighborhoods \nand communities. They protect us against those who have a predatory \nintent against our country, the terrorists, but it also protects our \nchildren against sexual predators. We want to salute President Bush and \nAttorney General Gonzales for developing a specific watch list for the \nregistration of sexual predators. It has given a wake-up call to all \nStates. Predatory behavior doesn't go in our country.\n  The Department of Justice accounts for almost 50 percent of our \nentire bill. The FBI is the lead agency. It will receive $5.3 billion, \na $100 million increase, so that they can continue to fight organized \nterrorism and organized crime as well. We have given the FBI a record \namount to do that. We look forward to working with them to correct some \nof their problems in technology, and we know they are improving their \nmanagement. At the same time, we thank them for focusing, No. 1, on \nprotecting our children through the Missing and Exploited Children's \nProgram, which, by the way, the Missing and Exploited Children's \nProgram is now going to be used to help locate over 100 to 1,000 \nchildren, where their parents don't know where they are. We are going \nto find those children, and we are going to bring them back to their \nparents one way or another.\n  Working together with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, \nwe want to make sure they have the resources to protect us against \narson, street crime, and gangs that are now menacing our communities. \nWe thank them for the outstanding job that the ATF arson laboratory did \nin Maryland. It identified the DC serial arsonist that burned down \nhomes in Charles County. It also provided the ballistic laboratory that \nhelped to solve the DC sniper case. Our law enforcement is on the job, \nand they are protecting us every day. We have tried to protect them in \nthe Federal budget so that they can do their job.\n  At the same time, while we are doing law enforcement, we look at \ncommerce and science. This is where we talk about building a stronger \neconomy and a smarter America. We do all we can to fund the programs in \nthe Commerce Department. One of our most important places, though, is \nwhere we protect our intellectual property. As we are working to \nprotect our citizens, we have to protect what our citizens invent. We \nare the country of discovery, of innovation, of invention. If you \ninvented it, we think you ought to be able to keep it. We, therefore, \nprovided $1.7 billion for the Patent and Trademark Office. It is a \nrecord amount that should help them reduce their backlog of patent \napplications and help us make sure we secure those new ideas that are \ngoing to create the new jobs right here in the United States.\n  We are also supporting our great Federal laboratories that help come \nup with the new ideas and set the standards for products so they can go \nto the marketplace. That is the National Institute of Standards and \nTechnology located in Maryland. It sets standards that are critical to \nsuccessful commerce and, because of what they do,\n\n[[Page S9770]]\n\ntransfers technology to the American business community.\n  The bill fully funds the Advanced Tech Program and the Manufacturing \nExtension Program which are important to fostering competitiveness. In \nscience, we have NOAA, which I have spoken about, which does fantastic \nwork on weather prediction, saving lives, and saving communities \nthrough their predictions. But at the same time, they do fantastic \nresearch on our oceans, on our bays and so on. We know that we are \ngoing to face, because of Katrina, a real impact on oysters and clams \nand shrimp on the gulf coast. What are the ideas to be able to help out \nand restore the bays that produce those delicious morsels but that are \nso important to the economy and to little people who have names like \nwatermen and fishermen and seafood? This is what we are challenging \nNOAA to do, continue their great research. But we need immediate and \npractical solutions to protect the seafood industry on the gulf coast.\n\n  Then there is NASA. Originally, we thought the only risky operation \nwas going to be the Hubble telescope. Now we have human need pressing \nus, and we are going to meet that need. For NASA, we have provided \n$16.4 billion, a $200 million increase over last year. This does \ninclude the money for the Hubble servicing mission. We are going to \nprovide full funding for the space shuttle, for the space station, and \nwork with Dr. Griffin on the new Crew Exploration Vehicle.\n  Because of Katrina, we know two major NASA facilities were heavily \ndamaged. One was the Michoud assembly facility in New Orleans. The \nother was the Stennis facility in Mississippi. This is everything from \nshipyards to spaceships, from Navy ships to spaceships. We know those \nfacilities suffered tremendous damage, and 50 percent of the employees \nlost their homes. We expect the administration and the agencies to tell \nus what happened to those employees and how we can help them.\n  On the bright side, we are so happy about the successful mission of \nDiscovery last month. Weren't we proud of Colonel Collins and that \ndaring-do, can-do crew that got out there and did the kind of repair \nwork that had never been done in space, showed our courage and our \ntenacity and our technological capability. We want to support them. We \nknow they want to return to space. The shuttle tanks were to be \nprepared in New Orleans. We are going to have to make adjustments. But \nthen again, everybody is making adjustments, and we are all going to \nwork together. The National Science Foundation is also in here. Just \nthink what the Committee on Science is--NIST, NOAA, NASA, the Science \nFoundation. These are the new ideas. It is going to help with funding \nfor important research in new ideas in basic science like physics and \nalso breakthrough things again for new jobs like biotech and nanotech.\n  One of the important things we did was preserve the funding for \nhistorically Black colleges and universities. This is also coming at a \nvery important time. Louisiana, I believe the entire gulf, was the home \nof 28 colleges and universities that were affected by Katrina. \nHistorically Black colleges all over America, such as Morgan State in \nmy hometown, are accepting the young men and women from the \nhistorically Black colleges of the gulf coast. They are accepting them \nand not asking questions about tuition and other things. This is a way \nof also being of help. So we are all pitching in together.\n  One of the flashing yellow lights in the bill is the census. Because \nof staying within our 302(b) allocation, we funded the Census Bureau \nwith $17 million below last year's level and $150 million below the \nPresident's request. The census is important. They don't just do \nsomething every 10 years where they knock on your door and give you a \ncomplicated form. It continually evaluates who we are and where we live \nand gives us important information so that communities and businesses \ncan develop everything from transportation and education plans to \nbusiness targeting the new demography in our country. We are proud of \nthe civil servants that work in Maryland, and we look forward to \nlooking at how we can restore funding. When we looked at our \npriorities, we thought Census could do without an increase and even a \nvery modest $17 million cut. We hope to restore that in conference. But \nwhen we looked at all that we needed to do in Justice and all that we \nneeded to do, particularly in agencies such as the FBI, we felt that \nthese were our priorities. Now that Katrina has hit us, we will be \nreevaluating as we go along.\n  That is our bill. We are proud of our bill because we have tried to \nfocus on where America is today and where America needs to go tomorrow. \nWe tried to look at the day-to-day needs of our constituents and know \nthat they needed to be protected in their local communities. That is \nwhy we looked at local law enforcement. We know that we face predatory \nassault from everything from organized crime to organized terrorists. \nWe focused on our Justice Department, but also on our science and on \nour commerce for new ideas, for new products and invention, but also to \nfund those agencies that help them protect their intellectual property \nagainst often international predators and also come up with those new \nideas.\n  Along the way, Katrina has happened. We are going to make sure this \nbill serves the needs now, the immediate needs of our neighbors in the \ngulf and those States that have been so kind and so generous and \nwelcoming. We view this bill as a work in progress, but work it will \nbe, and progress we will make. We are going to work together.\n  These are not refugees. They are evacuees, as our Senators are. We \nneed to remember all of the people who have been affected. We are one \nnation, under God, and we are indivisible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am impressed with the comprehensive \nstatement made by the distinguished Senator from Maryland, describing \nthe provisions of this bill that have been prepared and are being \npresented today to the Senate by her subcommittee. Her comments and the \ntone that she has set reflects so well on the Senate. It also reflects \na bipartisanship that is so important to the writing of this bill. This \nis not a Republican bill nor a Democratic bill. It is a bill that \nreflects a consensus of the members of the subcommittee and also \nrespect for the requests being made by the administration for funding \nof these agencies and departments for the next fiscal year.\n  We have all had what some might say is a wake-up call about hurricane \nwarnings, mobilization of State and local resources, and relocation of \npeople who are threatened by the ravages of storms such as Katrina. \nThis bill is designed to meet the challenge that is so fresh in our \nminds. It can be presented to Government officials, private \nindividuals, and businesses as we seek to protect our families and our \nproperty and our lives from the threats hurricanes and other storms \nmight pose. It also reflects, as the distinguished Senator pointed out, \nfunding that provides the resources we need for law-and-order \nactivities, crime prevention, and investigations to ensure we are doing \nwhat has to be done to protect the security of our country.\n  I know of no more important bill that will come before the Senate \nthis year from our committee than the one being presented today by \nSenators Shelby and Mikulski. They have done a wonderful job working \ntogether. They have set an example by which we could all profit.\n  We need to act expeditiously on the bill, consider any amendments \nthat any Senator has to add money or delete funding that is contained \nin the bill. We assure everyone that we want to act in a thoughtful way \nand one that will reflect credit on the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for \napproximately 30 minutes, perhaps more.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S9771]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/08/senate-section/article/S9771-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9771-S9774]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           HURRICANE KATRINA\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise today as the senior from \nLouisiana. But I was not born a Senator. I was born a Louisianian. I am \na daughter of the Crescent City, raised by a family of places whose \nnames may seem strange and exotic to people in Washington, DC, and \naround the Nation places like Plaquemines, Cocodrie, Kenner, Slidell, \nSt. Tammany, St. Bernard and Bogalusa.\n  Most people refer to this region of the country--Mississippi, \nLouisiana and Alabama--as the energy coast the maritime coast, the gulf \ncoast. The largest city in this area is the city of New Orleans, almost \n500,000 people, my hometown. At one time or another every Member of \nthis body has told me their own story about what they love about New \nOrleans and south Louisiana. For some, it is our music. For others it \nis Mardi Gras. And yet others, it is that special magic. Each one of \nyou has come away from our State with a special memory, a singular \nmoment that reflects the vibrant culture and personality of our State. \nAnd what all of my colleagues have mentioned to me over many years is \nthe special, special spirit of the people.\n  Today, I stand before my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, to \nreport to the Senate that our people are hurting. Some are despairing \nand many are still crying. But our spirit is strong and it will be this \nspirit, along with the best work the Senate has ever done, that we will \nlift this region and rebuild it.\n  Thousands are dead, and only God knows how many. Hundreds and \nthousands are homeless, jobless, and without their businesses, large \nand small. But amidst water, death, destruction, anguish and anger, our \nspirit is strong.\n  And today, there are thousands of heroes. Those heroes may not be \nanybody in this Chamber, but I will tell you who the heroes are. They \nare the leaders of Plaquemines Parish and St. Bernard and Orleans and \nJefferson and counties in Mississippi that kept their government \nfunctioning even as much of their parish laid under water. In St. \nBernard and Plaquemines Parish, that water was 8 to 20 feet high in \nplaces. And in New Orleans, the water still stands 6 to 10 feet in some \nplaces on the east bank. The only thing out of the water the last time \nI left was Jackson Square, the Cathedral and the French Quarter. \nBecause the people who settled the city were smart enough to put it on \nthe highest ground they could find, and that high ground has been \nserving this Nation so well and so magnificently for over 300 years. \nAnd it is still there.\n  The heroes are the New Orleans sheriffs who secured and evacuated the \ncity jail, not because they were trying to coddle the prisoners, but \nbecause there was a threatened jail break when the system failed and \nthe electricity went off. So the deputies who had lost their own homes \nand had lost maybe members of their own family, swam through water to \nget the prisoners out of the prison, not to give them a warm meal but \nto secure them, so hardened rapists and murderers would not plague the \ncity at its time of greatest distress.\n  Our local leaders never once flinched from their duty to protect \ntheir residents and save every man, woman or child, regardless of race \nor income.\n  It was so desperate that the law enforcement didn't have to triage. \nThe people were triaging themselves. In other words, when the boat \ndrove up, they would put the old people first in the boat. Then they \nwould put the babies in the boat. And all the young, ``healthy'' people \nwould just stay on the roof until the boat could come back. Sometimes \nit did and in some cases it was too late.\n  I flew back here after one plane that I got on had no fuel. I had to \ncome back with the Commandant of the Coast Guard, and he told me \nhimself yesterday the Coast Guard rescued 32,000 people either by boat \nor by helicopter. And that is not counting what Wildlife and Fisheries \nagents did in Louisiana, Mississippi, or Alabama. That is not counting \nwhat regular boat owners, once they could wade through water and turn \ntheir boats on went down and did themselves, of which the news media \ndid not cover. Because the only thing the news media could focus on was \nthe Convention Center and the Superdome because it made the best \npicture. We understand that as politicians. They need visuals. I am \nsorry I couldn't provide any more visuals for them, but there was a lot \nmore going on than just at the Superdome and the Convention Center.\n  Across the State, perhaps the greatest heroes are those we don't know \nabout the concerned and courageous friends who took care of elderly \nneighbors and ensured their safe evacuation. One brief story: An \nelderly African-American woman in a shelter came up to me. She was a \nretired teacher. Her feet were wrapped because she had cut up her feet \nin this episode. She said, ``Ms. Landrieu, please go back and tell \nthose people in Washington we were fine after the hurricane hit. It \nwasn't the hurricane that put us under. It was that water that came up \nfrom the levee. Don't they know anything up there about the 17th Street \nCanal? Don't they know anything about the Florida Street Canal?''\n  I said, ``No, Ma'am, but we're going to tell them more about that.''\n  She said, ``I stood on my ladder for 2 days. I've never seen water \nlike that. That water kept going up 6 inches and going down 6 inches.'' \nDo you know what she was experiencing with the water rising and \nreceding? She was feeling the tide of Lake Ponchartrain. She said, ``It \nkept going up to my nose and going down to my chest.''\n  The Louisiana State flag depicts a pelican. The pelican takes from \nherself, her own breast to feed her young. Thousands of Louisianians \nthis week brought that state symbol to life.\n  As brave and bold as my fellow Louisianians have been--and our heart \ngoes out to the people in Mississippi and Alabama--we have been moved \nbeyond measure by the generosity and selflessness of our fellow \nAmericans. New York City itself sent 600 of its finest and bravest \npolice officers and firefighters who were willing to run into a \ncollapsing tower on September 11 knowing what we didn't know, knowing \nthat the radios on their hips were not going to work. But they ran in \nthe building anyway. Those police officers are on their way right now \nto help the city of New Orleans. And I want to thank the Senators from \nNew York, the delegation from New York, for sending them.\n\n  Cities, suburbs, and States across the Nation have welcomed our \ncitizens as their own. Senator Lincoln told me yesterday on the phone, \n``Mary, send them north. As soon as they cross the borders, I've got \nthem in my arms.'' I thank Senator Lincoln and thank all the Senators \nthat have called.\n  And so, if it is possible that my heart is a little heavy today, I've \nseen more in the last 2 weeks than in my entire life, and I hope never \nto witness it again. But while my heart is heavy, my heart today is \nalso lifted with gratitude for my fellow Americans.\n  Of course, already some in Washington are pointing fingers at State \nand local officials--officials who had little more than just the good \nsense that God gave them while trying to save everyone that they could, \nall amidst criticism that they have had to bear from other government \nofficials.\n  In this Chamber alone, every one of you voted the other night to send \nbillions of dollars of aid and assistance. As Harry Reid said earlier \ntoday, it will probably cost us a lot more. I am sorry I could not even \nreport to you an accurate estimate of what that might be, but I predict \nit will be over $200 billion.\n  As I stand here today, Senator Vitter, my partner, remains in the \nState to continue assessing damage. He has been a steady voice through \nthis, and I want to acknowledge him.\n  This unprecedented catastrophe will require unprecedented support. I \nam concerned today because our Nation, our national government failed \nin its greatest responsibility, and that is protecting the lives of \nAmericans. I am not saying the military failed, or the Coast Guard \nfailed and most certainly not the National Guard that was there before \nthe storm hit and is still there.\n  Let me talk a minute about my National Guard. Eight thousand of them \nhave already been to Iraq and back, not once but twice. Three thousand \nof them are scheduled to come home in September. The Governor and I and \nSenator Vitter were planning a homecoming for them. They are going to \nget quite a homecoming because many of them are from south Louisiana, \nand they don't have houses to come home to. I am here to tell you, that \nwhile\n\n[[Page S9772]]\n\nthey may not have houses, they do have a home. We will do the best we \ncan, and General Landreneau is well aware of the situation with his men \nand women on their way back from Iraq to hold their families tight.\n  We must learn from this experience. If we do not, we will fail again.\n  I have learned more in 2 weeks than I could ever have hoped to learn. \nI am going to continue to learn, and I ask the Senators to open their \nhearts and minds and learn. We don't ever want this to happen to any \nother city or any other place in this country for as long as we are on \nthis Earth.\n  It is not true that Louisiana was not prepared. Surely we could have \ndone a better job in every case, but our evacuation plan--and I want to \ngive credit to the Governor of Mississippi and the Governor of \nLouisiana--Haley Barbour and Kathleen Blanco, who have been planning \nsince Hurricane Ivan struck a year ago where everyone got stuck on the \ninterstates and the back roads, those two Governors worked out a plan \nbecause we share a highway. We don't have a Louisiana highway that goes \nnorth and a Mississippi highway. We share our highways, and those \nGovernors made a plan to get everybody out, and it worked as well as \nsomething like that can work. We had 2 million people approximately to \nevacuate in about 2 days. We got a lot of people out.\n  But when the storm hit and the levees broke, our calls went \nunanswered. In years past, our bills have languished here on the \ncalendar. Money we requested before has been postponed year after year, \nyear after year. I don't even want to talk to my colleagues about \ncoastal erosion. They have heard it from me so many times and from \neverybody in the Louisiana delegation. They can give that speech better \nthan I can.\n  But I will tell you one thing about our Federal Government. Our \nFederal Government, whether it was FEMA or this administrator or former \nadministration or us, gambled that the predictions that countless \nexperts voiced time and time again were mere rhetoric. They gambled \nthat no one would notice if Louisiana's critical and vital role in our \nnational economy was threatened.\n  And Washington rolled the dice and Louisiana lost.\n  I cannot stand here today and tell you that if all the money we had \nasked for, if it would have kept the levees up, but I can tell you that \nit would have given us more protection than we had.\n  Nor can I say with certainty that full funding for restoring our \ncoasts would have protected those who perished in St. Bernard or in \nJefferson or Washington parish or the counties in Mississippi and \nAlabama. But I can assure you that we would have had at least had a \nfighting chance. And I intend to find out just how much of a fighting \nchance we would have had.\n  And I intend to find out why the Federal response, particularly the \nresponse of FEMA, was so incompetent and insulting to the people of our \nStates.\n  Already some in Washington are pointing fingers that something is \nwrong with my state and local officials, and if they would have been a \nlittle smarter, a little tougher, a little braver maybe this could have \nbeen avoided. This hurricane was a category four. It was one of the \nworst storms we have seen in this century. The eye of the storm went \nright over Slidell, LA. Waveland, MS, I understand from Senators \nCochran and Lott, is gone. Biloxi is quite damaged, and that is where \nthe storm came.\n\n  I am sorry we couldn't do anything about that, but I want you to know \nthe people of our States have survived storms before. That was not what \nput us under. It was the levee systems that broke in New Orleans, a \ncity that invented the gravity pump, a city that helped the Dutch \nsecure the Netherlands and sent our engineering to Venice to keep that \ncity floating. We invented those pumps in south Louisiana. We know \nabout pumps. Harry Reid's seen them himself.\n  We know that the head of the National Hurricane Center said that he \nbriefed the President of the United States on the threat of Katrina in \na video conference call the day before she hit land.\n  We know the President said, quote, I don't think anybody anticipated \nthe breach of the levees. Everybody anticipated the breach of the \nlevee, including computer simulations in which this administration \nparticipated. Even the clay figurine, Mr. Bill, from ``Saturday Night \nLive'' anticipated the breach. His creator, a friend of mine, has used \nhim in public service announcements for over 2 years, saying this will \nbe the effect if this happens. How can it be that Mr. Bill was better \ninformed than Mr. Bush?\n  We know the Secretary of Homeland Security pronounced himself, quote, \nextremely pleased with the response of every element of the Federal \nGovernment, even as the cable news networks were broadcasting images \ntelling how he was so tragically wrong.\n  We know that FEMA was unaware that 20,000 Americans were stranded at \nthe Convention Center without food, without water, without security, \nwithout clothes, without buses, without toilets and with no way out, \nand I had to stand there and listen to the news media say these people \nwere lawless. These were mothers and fathers trying to find water for \ntheir kids. I might have been a little upset under the circumstances \nmyself.\n  We know that someone has to be accountable. Let me be the first to \ntake any blame that is to be assigned.\n  I will not allow my local officials to be made into scapegoats for \nothers. I will not allow carping from those who were not there to \ndiminish my Governor, my Lieutenant Governor, who happens to be my \nbrother, who spent 3 days in a rescue boat, despite the pleas of his \nown wife, his sister, his mother and father not to go. He went anyway, \nand he lifted both the living and the dead out with his own hands.\n  Within 24 hours of the storm hitting the Gulf Coast, Senator Frist \ncalled and Senator Reid called. I appreciate so much that they were \nright there. I tried to reach Thad Cochran; he tried to reach me. I \ntried to reach Trent Lott. And David Vitter and I were together the \nwhole time, but we couldn't get through on our cell phones. I know they \ncalled, and I thank them very much.\n  The record for rebuilding costs will be staggering, but it will pale \nin comparison to the staggering incompetence of this national \ngovernment which is responsible.\n  Black people suffered, White people suffered, poor people suffered, \nand rich people suffered. The whole city is under water on the east \nbank. The wealthy neighborhoods have 10 feet of water, and the poor \nneighborhoods have 10 feet of water. Water does not know boundaries. It \ndoesn't know demographics. It doesn't know Democrat or Republican. It \ndoesn't know to stop at rich neighborhoods. It doesn't know just to go \nto poor neighborhoods. It goes everywhere. And there are wealthy people \nwho are desperate. They don't know how to restart their businesses and \nkeep their employees paid. They have no idea where to put their \nbusinesses. Do they leave the state? Do they go to Atlanta? Do they \ncome back? What do they do with their wife and children? Do they take \nthem and put them to school in Atlanta, or do they set their businesses \nup on the highest ground they can find?\n  The poor people are very disoriented. They have a hard time normally \nand they are having a real hard time now.\n  I want to say a special word of thanks personally to Ted Koppel for \nthe beautiful piece he did last night, because I haven't been able to \nwatch much television myself, but I got to see his piece. And we need \njournalists like that. I kept thinking, where's Walter Cronkite, and \nall I had was Geraldo Rivera.\n  I want to personally thank my family, my parents, my children, who \nevacuated with me that morning.\n  And the final word is this to the President: Mr. President, we need \nyou. We need your help. The last time I shook the President's hand he \nlooked at me and he said, ``Senator, I appreciate your passion.''\n  And I said, ``Thank you, Mr. President, because passion is what we \nneed.''\n  He said, ``I'm sorry you lost your childhood home. I know that's \nupsetting to you.'' I want to be clear for the record in that piece \nthat you all saw with me with George Stephanopoulos. I was not crying \nin anguish because the home that I walked out of with my children was \ngone. I knew it would be gone when I left. It was an anguished cry, a \nplea to the only one that I thought could hear, and that was God\n\n[[Page S9773]]\n\nhimself, and I know he has heard, because the people of my state have \ncried out to him for now over a week and a half. But as he gives us the \ngrace and the wisdom to do our job, I hope we can do it well because \nthere are hundreds of thousands of families who are depending on us to \ndo our best work.\n\n  Today we are going to rebuild New Orleans and the coasts of \nMississippi and Alabama because America needs New Orleans right where \nit is, as well as the parishes of St. Bernard, St. Tammany, Orleans, \nJefferson, and Plaquemines, and Hancock, Harrison and Jackson counties \nin Mississippi; and Baldwin and Mobile counties in Alabama.\n  The gulf coast region of our Nation is simply too important to be \nleft for dead. One of the founding geniuses of our freedom, Thomas \nJefferson, understood that. Two hundred years ago he purchased \nLouisiana--then it stretched from the Mississippi to the Rocky \nMountains. And that purchase put us on the road to greatness, from sea \nto shining sea.\n  It is an energy coast. It was put there for a reason. We did not go \nthere to sunbathe. We went there to set up the Mississippi River, to \ntame that river, to create channels for this country to grow and \nprosper. The Higgins boats that saved us from World War II were built \nin New Orleans. Forty-three thousand people built those boats and \nheaded them out to Normandy. We are going to rebuild our shipping \nindustry, we are going to rebuild our maritime industry, and we are \ngoing to rebuild this great gulf coast of the United States.\n  I ask unanimous consent have printed in the Record a letter dated \nSeptember 7, 2005.\n  There being no objection, the material was orderd to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 7, 2005.\n     Hon. Bill Frist,\n     U.S. Senate Majority Leader,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     U.S. Senate Minority Leader,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Leaders: As the U.S. Senate begins work on further \n     Hurricane Katrina relief and rebuilding legislation, we write \n     to implore both of you to do everything in your power to \n     ensure it is done in a spirit and through a process that is \n     fully bipartisan.\n       Now, just nine days after this devastating storm hit, we \n     have already detected some troubling signs in Washington and \n     in the Senate. There are signs that some might try to \n     maneuver in the debate on relief legislation specifically for \n     partisan gain. We view any such attempt as abhorrent and \n     injurious to the already suffering victims of the hurricane.\n       We implore both of you to lead in a completely different \n     direction. This must be done not only through words and \n     symbols but by developing all relief legislation in a fully \n     bipartisan way.\n       The Senate has always acted this way in the past in \n     developing disaster relief legislation, whether to address 9/\n     11, Hurricane Andrew, or a myriad of other challenges. The \n     need for this method of action and leadership is even greater \n     now.\n       There is no question that there were mistakes made and \n     lessons learned from this tragic experience. The Senate will \n     have ample time to thoroughly investigate this event, and we \n     plan to play a major role in these investigations. Now, all \n     of our resources and efforts should be dedicated to the \n     rescuing of victims, providing food, shelter, employment, \n     education and healthcare to the victims of Hurricane Katrina. \n     We must also begin laying the groundwork for the long-term \n     recovery and re-building of our great state. Please do not \n     make the citizens of Louisiana a victim once again by \n     allowing our immediate needs to be delayed by partisanship.\n       In these past situations, committee chairmen and ranking \n     members always developed legislation together and it passed \n     with near unanimity.\n       Thank you for your leadership and your attention to this \n     vital plea.\n           Sincerely,\n     Mary Landrieu.\n       U.S. Senate.\n     David Vitter.\n       U.S. Senate.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as ranking member of the Subcommittee on \nResearch, Nutrition, and General Legislation of the Agriculture, \nNutrition and Forestry Committee I am today introducing a bill with \nSenator Harkin, the ranking member on that committee, to provide \nadditional emergency food assistance in response to the devastation \ncaused by Hurricane Katrina, and the flooding in the aftermath of that \nmassive storm. It is very similar to the efforts of Senator Landrieu \nand Leader Reid but it just focuses on food assistance.\n  This legislation will provide USDA with additional funding and \nauthorities to provide a strong and continuous response to the food \nneeds of thousands of families adversely affected by Hurricane Katrina.\n  While thousands may have perished in America's largest natural \ndisaster, we must turn to the living to do what we can to help. I am \nespecially troubled by the horror stories I have heard about the \ntreatment of the elderly. It was almost impossible to watch the images \non television.\n  Another terrifying image was of children separated from their \nparents, trying to survive on their own. The most gruesome was the \nbodies floating in black water.\n  In the Federal response to this national catastrophe there is a \nbright spot.\n  The U.S. Department of Agriculture has done a good job. FEMA gets an \n``F,'' in contrast. In fact, I heard today on NPR that the Navy was not \ngiven the go-ahead by FEMA to send ships with hospital facilities down \nto New Orleans and that senior naval officers were very frustrated that \nthey could not help earlier.\n  In contrast, USDA has quietly and efficiently assisted thousands of \ndisplaced persons. Secretary Johanns, Deputy Secretary Conner and Under \nSecretary Bost have done a great job within the limitations of their \nauthority. They responded immediately.\n  I also appreciate the work of the Food and Nutrition Service within \nUSDA. I thank them.\n  This bill provides USDA with additional funding to continue its \nefforts and gives USDA some additional authorities regarding the food \nstamp program and child nutrition programs. Our effort on this \nlegislation should be taken as a supplement to what they are already \ndoing, and an enhancement of their authority.\n  USDA is not only helping in areas which will need to be rebuilt, but \nthey are helping those families who have been displaced and been forced \nto move.\n  There has been a huge outpouring of sympathy from every corner of \nevery county in my home State of Vermont. In addition to the assistance \nalready provided, Vermont stands ready to help the displaced families, \nthe unemployed workers, the distraught children, and the destroyed \ncommunities.\n  This bill was written to be referred to the Agriculture, Nutrition \nand Forestry Committee where nutrition bills have always been handled \nin a bipartisan fashion.\n  I look forward to working with all the Senators on that committee.\n  Chairman Chambliss has tackled every issue the committee has faced \nthis year in a direct and effective fashion and I look forward to \nworking with him, and all members of the committee, on an emergency \nfood assistance package that goes to the White House for signature.\n  I know that he and his staff have been coordinating with USDA and \nthat Senators on the Committee will, of course, work with Senators from \nall of the affected States on any advice or changes that are \nappropriate. Some of the provisions in the bill are modeled after ideas \nthat worked well in responding to Hurricane Andrew where, once again, \nUSDA was commended for handling the emergency very well.\n  This bill is a starting point, not an end point. I know that, but I \nwanted to get the ball rolling to have language to run by my colleagues \nwho represent areas demolished in this disaster. I want to thank \nSenator Reid and Senator Landrieu for coordinating with Senator Harkin \nand me on this matter.\n  All the Senators in the affected areas have been working day and \nnight on trying to get aid to those in need, whether from local, State, \ncharitable, non-profit or Federal Government sources. I will continue \nto work with all of them.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a summary of Hurricane response to food \nstamps and food assistance be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Summary of Hurricane Response/Food Stamp and Food Assistance Response\n\n\n                         The Food Stamp Program\n\n       This proposal would provide USDA with additional funding \n     and authorities to provide\n\n[[Page S9774]]\n\n     a strong and continuous response to the food needs of \n     thousands of families adversely affected by Hurricane \n     Katrina. It would improve the Food Stamp Program's response \n     to Hurricane Katrina. It generally would expire no later than \n     the end of federal fiscal year 2006. The President would have \n     the authority to terminate its provisions earlier if \n     conditions improved. The proposal would target three groups \n     of low-income households: those living in areas Katrina hit, \n     those that lost jobs in the disaster area, and those \n     relocated from the disaster area to other parts of the \n     country.\n       The proposal would incorporate the terms of USDA's \n     Hurricane Katrina disaster relief policy for the period \n     specified above:\n       States must act within seven days on all food stamp \n     applications from affected households.\n       Households doubled up with friends or relatives could apply \n     for food stamps on their own.\n       Work requirements and the three-month time limit on \n     childless adults regarding finding a job would be suspended \n     for disaster victims.\n       The legislation would expand food stamp assistance to \n     disaster victims:\n       To account for higher food costs for people in disaster \n     areas and people displaced by Hurricane Katrina, the maximum \n     benefit provided through the food Stamp Program is increased \n     by 10 percent.\n       The gross income limit for disaster victims would increase \n     from 130 percent of the poverty line to 150 percent. This \n     would help disaster survivors that suddenly incur high \n     shelter costs when, for example, they temporarily live in a \n     motel. (The net income limit would remain at 100 percent of \n     the poverty line to ensure that only low-income people \n     receive food stamps.)\n       All vehicles of disaster survivors, both those that they \n     have with them and those they left behind, would be excluded \n     from determining the household's resources.\n       For one year, all vehicles and bank accounts would be \n     exempt from the $2,000 resource limit in recognition that \n     households are facing many extraordinary expenses and should \n     not be required to spend down to $2,000 when their savings \n     may have to last them until they can find new jobs. In \n     addition, disaster relief aid from federal, state, or local \n     governments, charities, insurance settlements, and other \n     sources would not count as resources.\n       Assets owned by a household, but which are currently \n     inaccessible to the household due to the emergency, will not \n     be counted for purposes of determining food stamp \n     eligibility. for example, a family should not be rendered \n     ineligible because of a house or car the family had to leave \n     behind in the disaster area.\n       Food stamp benefits would not be prorated for the month \n     based on the date the household applies. Under disaster \n     conditions, families' applications may be postponed through \n     no fault of their own. During this time, the families are \n     forced to spend their scarce funds on food and remain just as \n     needy as families that were able to get a ride to the food \n     stamp office sooner.\n       The legislation also would streamline procedures for aiding \n     affected households by:\n       Having the federal government assume 100 percent (rather \n     than the usual 50 percent) of the administrative costs of \n     serving disaster victims. State expenses to address the range \n     of issues presented by these disaster victims are rising \n     constantly and this change will assist states in their time \n     of need.\n       Encouraging states to work aggressively to serve affected \n     households by excluding any errors in applying disaster \n     procedures from error rate calculations.\n       Waiving any claims for inaccurate issuances to affected \n     households except in cases of fraud.\n       Requiring USDA to work with states to eliminate duplication \n     between households initially certified for food stamps in \n     their home state that are then relocated to a different \n     state. Except where someone deliberately lies to get double \n     benefits, displaced persons would not be required to keep \n     track of which food stamps they received from which state \n     while this overlap is being resolved. Recipients should be \n     encouraged to spend food stamp benefits to feed their \n     families even when they are uncertain about the status of \n     their cases. This is particularly true since overburdened \n     state food stamp agencies may be ill-equipped to answer their \n     questions.\n\n\n    The Emergency Food Assistance Program and Commodity Distribution\n\n       In terms of immediate emergency relief, food stamp receipt \n     may, in some cases, not be the most timely form of assistance \n     that a family may access. Emergency commodities may be a \n     faster and more efficient manner by which to provide \n     immediate food assistance through food banks, food pantries, \n     and congregate meal sites. In order to provide USDA with \n     sufficient funding by which to provide emergency funding, \n     this food assistance emergency package includes;\n       $200 million for The Emergency Food Assistance Program \n     (TEFAP), to be spent either on commodities or for \n     transportation, processing, and administrative costs.\n       $200 million for USDA to procure bulk commodities using \n     Section 32 authority.\n       $20 million for USDA to replenish Commodity Supplemental \n     Food Program commodity stocks destroyed by Hurricane Katrina.\n\n\nSpecial Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children \n                                 (WIC)\n\n       To allow for unexpected increases in WIC caseload as well \n     as the possibility of rising food costs in the WIC program, \n     this package provides $200 million dollars (available October \n     1) for the WIC program.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/08/senate-section/article/S9774-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9774-S9776]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  TO ALLOW UNITED STATES COURTS TO CONDUCT BUSINESS DURING EMERGENCY \n                               CONDITIONS\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed \nto the immediate consideration of S. 1634 and H.R. 3650, en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the bills en bloc.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1634) to allow United States courts to conduct \n     business during emergency conditions, and for other purposes.\n       A bill (H.R. 3650) to allow United States courts to conduct \n     business during emergency conditions, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bills.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition to support legislation \nthat is urgently needed in light of the devastation caused by Hurricane \nKatrina. This legislation would authorize Federal circuit, district, \nand bankruptcy courts to conduct special sessions outside their \nrespective boundaries in times of emergency. Currently there is no \nauthority in the law for Federal courts to hold session beyond their \ngeographical districts.\n  The need for such authority initially became apparent following the \nterrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Those attacks seriously \nimpaired Federal court operations in New York City at the time. Court \nfacilities available in nearby districts, such as New Jersey, could \nhave alleviated the disruption in court services, but the authority \nprovided in this legislation did not exist.\n  The recent impact of Hurricane Katrina on the Federal courts in \nLouisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi has heightened the urgency of \ncongressional action on this proposal. When emergencies, whether they \nbe natural disasters or terrorist attacks, make shifting court \noperations to other court facilities within the affected district \nimpossible, a Federal court facility in an adjoining district or \ncircuit might be more readily and safely available to court personnel, \nlitigants, jurors, and the public.\n  The widespread flooding and vast destruction caused by Hurricane \nKatrina has created precisely this scenario. All of the Federal court \nfacilities in the Eastern District of Louisiana are severely damaged \nand will not be available for a significant period of time. Courthouses \nhave roof and window damage, extensive water infiltration, and no \nelectrical power. Senior court management are meeting in Lafayette to \ndiscuss finding viable and possibly long-term alternative sites for \ncourt operations for that entire district, but such alternative sites \nmost certainly must be outside the geographical boundaries of that \ndistrict.\n  Federal courts in the Middle and Western Districts of Louisiana are \nexpected to remain open for business and possibly could provide \ntemporary courtroom facilities, and the judiciary will be exploring \nthese and other possibilities if given the authority proposed in this \nbill.\n  In the Southern District of Alabama, seawater has flooded the \nbasement of the Mobile, AL, courthouse, and debris is scattered \nthroughout the grounds. The court does not know when that facility will \nbecome operational again, and this court too, may have to be \ntemporarily relocated outside of the district. Similarly, in the \nSouthern District of Mississippi, seawater has flooded the Gulfport \nfacility, and communications and electrical power are down. Court \noperations in the Gulfport area have been shifted within that district \nto the court facility in Jackson, MS.\n  The Fifth Circuit operations in New Orleans are completely closed and \nwill\n\n[[Page S9775]]\n\nremain so for the foreseeable future. In the meantime, the judiciary \nhas undertaken efforts to determine how much of the Fifth Circuit \noperations in New Orleans can be shifted within the circuit to Houston, \nand for what period of time.\n  The Federal courts in these areas devastated by Hurricane Katrina \nsimply must be able to shift court proceedings temporarily into a \nneighboring district. Without this legislation, the Federal criminal \njustice system risks grounding to a protracted halt throughout the gulf \nregion at a time when it is needed most. This legislation is needed now \nto avoid undue delay in bringing criminals to swift justice and \nresolving civil matters important to private citizens, especially \nbankruptcy proceedings in anticipation of an increase in bankruptcy \nfilings in Hurricane Katrina's wake.\n  The need for this bill was brought to my attention by Judge Edward \nBecker of the Third Circuit and his colleagues at the Administrative \nOffice of the Federal Courts and it enjoys their strong support. This \nbill is supported by my Democratic colleague, Senator Leahy, as well as \nSenators from the States ravaged by Hurricane Katrina. Since this bill \nis noncontroversial and clearly urgent, it is my hope that it can be \npassed by unanimous consent before the end of business today.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the devastation wrought by the Hurricane \nKatrina to New Orleans and the gulf coast is not yet fully known. As \nthe fate of thousands of our fellow Americans remains uncertain and the \nlives of many have been uprooted and the livelihood of many others \naffected, we must do all we can to assist those still suffering.\n  During this time of crisis, one thing we can do is ensure that the \nFederal courts in these afflicted regions continue to function. I \nworked with Senators Landrieu, Vitter, and Chairman Specter, Chairman \nSensenbrenner and Congressman Conyers to respond to a request from the \nJudicial Conference for additional authority to conduct court business \noutside the traditional territorial jurisdiction of a court. I thank \nthem for including in this bill important reporting and accountability \nrequirements.\n  In implementing this legislation, I want to be sure that we work with \nthe court, the Judicial Conference, and the Justice Department--but \nalso with the local bar and others who will be most directly affected \nby the invocation of the authority this legislation would grant.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the bills be read \nthe third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and any statements relating to the bills be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 3650) was read the third time and passed.\n  The bill (S. 1634) was read the third time and passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1634\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, for the information of colleagues, the \nbills, as stated, S. 1634 and H.R. 3650, are to address the issue of \nresponding to the emergency of the national disaster which has occurred \nand in some ways is ongoing in the Gulf States. This allows our Federal \ncourt system to continue its operation. This legislation requires it to \ndo so. This likely will be among a series of bills we will address over \nthe coming days and weeks that respond to the disaster itself and to \nservice the victims of that disaster, the people who are still in that \ncoastal area of Louisiana and Mississippi and Alabama, to the victims \nwho have been displaced, and to help volunteers and those people who \nare pitching in around the country, both government and private sector, \nas we come together to respond to this disaster that may well be the \nlargest natural disaster we have seen in the last 100 years.\n  The pending legislation is the Commerce, Science, and Justice \nappropriations bill. In this bill, as has been discussed, are a number \nof provisions related to Katrina and our response to Katrina, things \nsuch as the small business disaster loans.\n  We will be, in fact, on that bill shortly, and the chairman will be \nhere. I encourage Members to come over and talk to the chairman and \nranking member. We want to move expeditiously with this appropriations \nbill, in part, because it does have Katrina-related issues in it. I \nwould love to be able to finish this bill this week, if at all \npossible.\n  Second, just for the information of our colleagues, the House will \npass, at some point today or this afternoon, our second supplemental \nrequest to respond to this disaster. We have passed a $10.5 billion \nbill in an urgent emergency session last Thursday night. The Senate \naddressed it. This will be a second supplemental. As most know, it is \nmore than $50 billion, a very large sum, but that is the appropriate \nsum, as a second phase, as determined by our appropriate personnel and \nstaff.\n  The House will pass that later today. Once they pass that, it will \ncome to the Senate either this afternoon or this evening. I want to \nmake sure our members know we will have rollcall votes today. It may \nwell be tonight, but we need to pass the supplemental as soon as we \npossibly can.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, this side of the aisle concurred when \nthe majority leader offered the unanimous consent allowing the Federal \ncourt to do their business outside of their jurisdiction. It is the \npeople's business. How fitting we have the wheels of justice providing \nthat flexibility. I am sure there will be other legislation; we hope it \nall goes as smoothly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/08/senate-section/article/S9776-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9776-S9805]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n MAKING APPROPRIATIONS FOR SCIENCE, THE DEPARTMENTS OF STATE, JUSTICE, \n   AND COMMERCE, AND RELATED AGENCIES FOR FISCAL YEAR 2006--Continued\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. For the Commerce, State, Justice appropriations, we are \nnow waiting for the chairman to give his statement. We will correct \nsome technical amendments. We are urging colleagues to come and offer \namendments. We know of six on our side of the aisle. We are doing our \nbest. We would like to be able to finish this bill today, but if we \nstart offering amendments at sundown--sundown is a great cocktail \nparty, but that is not a great way to do appropriations. So we really \nwant to do this bill because it funds the FBI, it funds the Justice \nDepartment, it funds important help to the FEMA victims. We would like \nto move it along.\n\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I first compliment my colleagues, \nSenator Mikulski and Senator Shelby, for doing such a fine job and for \nthe hard work they have done on a very important issue. I compliment my \ncolleague and neighbor from Tennessee, Senator Frist, for working so \ndiligently to get the supplemental emergency appropriations bill over \nhere so we can help our neighbors in the delta region, in the Midsouth, \nlower Midsouth region. And I again compliment my colleagues from the \nStates of Mississippi and Alabama and Louisiana for their incredible \npassion and concern, as well as their hard work and their diligent \nefforts in responding to the needs of their constituency.\n  Sitting here on the Senate floor listening to my colleague from \nLouisiana, Senator Landrieu, I thought so desperately about some \nlessons I had learned growing up along the Mississippi River. My father \nwas very emphatic about how important it is to not only have good \nneighbors but to be a good neighbor, how critically important it is \nthat you have good neighbors that can help you raise your children, \neducate them, to help out with a cup of sugar or other needs you might \nhave at the end of the month if you do not have enough, to make sure if \nyou are trying to harvest your crops--as many of our farmers are right \nnow--and you find out that to diligently get those crops out of the \nfield you may not have enough hands or equipment to do that, that you \ncan look to your neighbor to help you do that and others things.\n  I think during times like these, as we look to our neighbors from \nLouisiana and Mississippi and Alabama and the needs they have, it is \nimportant for us--as we have been the recipient of their generosity and \ntheir camaraderie and fellowship--to understand how important it is for \nus, as neighbors, to be the good neighbor they have been to us and \nwelcoming their constituency into our homes in Arkansas, to help \nprovide them not only the necessities of life--the water, the food, the \nrest, the shelter, the clothes--they might need right now in such a \ndifficult time but also to provide them the hug, the love, the comfort, \nthe stability, the idea that we will be there with them, we will be \nthere for them, as long as they need us.\n  That is why I come to the floor of the Senate today. As Senator Frist \nhas mentioned, bringing an emergency supplemental appropriations bill \nover is really critical. But as many of us know who have worked \ndiligently on so many of the components of our Government--that \nprovides assistance and aid as well as just everyday services to the \npeople we represent--it is very important to enable these agencies, \nthese providers of services the language and the ability to use these \ndollars as efficiently, as effectively, and as quickly as they possibly \ncan be used in reaching the needs of our fellow Americans whose lives \nhave been shattered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1652\n\n    (Purpose: To provide for temporary medicaid disaster relief for \n        survivors of Hurricane Katrina, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. President, I wanted to wait until the Senator from Alabama had \ncome to offer an amendment, but I do rise today to offer an amendment \nto respond to the dire health care crisis that has been created by \nHurricane Katrina.\n\n  Hurricane Katrina has created a crisis of epic proportions for our \nNation but particularly in the Midsouth region. It is a humanitarian \ncrisis for the people of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. It is a \ncapacity crisis for hospitals, for clinics, and community health \ncenters, for physicians and nursing homes that are bursting at the \nseams with a surge in demand for care, mostly emergency care, mostly \ndire care, that has been evidenced by not only those who have been \nvictimized by the dangerous natural elements but also by those who have \nbeen removed at a moment's notice from their homes where they have left \ntheir insulin, perhaps, or their high blood pressure medicine or other \nthings that allow them a quality of life and a sustainability of life \non a day-to-day basis.\n  It is a fiscal crisis for the States directly affected as well as \nthose which have welcomed the displaced survivors, including Arkansas, \nFlorida, Oklahoma, Texas, and so many other States. When New York City \nfaced a\n\n[[Page S9777]]\n\nsimilar set of crises after 9/11, the city turned to Medicaid, the \nFederal-State partnership of health care for the poor, to provide \ntemporary coverage for victims of the tragedy. Our Nation's health care \nsafety net met the needs of millions of New York families, ensuring \nthem access to comprehensive health care services.\n  Current law restrictions on Medicaid eligibility impede our efforts \nto let Medicaid provide a safety net for Katrina's victims. Under \ncurrent law, low-income individuals must be residents of a State in \norder to qualify for Medicaid coverage in that State. Once the \nindividual is determined eligible and enrolled in Medicaid, Federal and \nState Governments share in the cost of purchasing medically necessary \nservices from hospitals, clinics, and other providers. The amount the \nState pays varies from State to State--from 29 percent in Louisiana to \n39 percent in Texas to 50 percent in the State of Virginia.\n  Katrina has displaced tens and perhaps hundreds of thousands of \ncitizens of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama who have lost \neverything and who will not be able to return to their homes until \ntheir communities are rebuilt. We are looking here to put into place \nsome commonsense directives, some flexibility to allow these \nindividuals to be able to access the kind of health care we in this \nNation know they need and as Americans we want to provide.\n  These citizens cannot return to their homes and may not return to \ntheir homes for months, but under current Medicaid law, they are only \neligible for benefits as residents of their home State. Under current \nlaw, Medicaid services can only be provided if the State puts up its \nown money for the match for the survivors, but the States directly \naffected by Katrina and those hosting the survivors will not be able to \nput up their match payments due to the fiscal crisis Katrina has \ncreated. This could put Medicaid coverage for our Nation's neediest \nindividuals in jeopardy.\n  We want to prevent that from happening. We want to assure our \nproviders and those in the communities who are there to wrap their arms \naround their fellow Americans--their neighbors, many of them to the \nsouth or to the east or wherever their neighbors from Louisiana, \nAlabama, and Mississippi have come from--that the Federal Government \nhas the common sense and the wisdom to be able to provide these \nservices with the flexibility and without the redtape that in many \ninstances would cause providers to turn them away.\n  In the face of the public health, and State budget crises Katrina has \ncreated, current law is not plausible. If normal application procedures \napply, the displaced survivors will face delays in establishing their \neligibility for Medicaid. The providers serving them during these \ndelays will not be reimbursed until after eligibility is established \nand may not receive reimbursement for their services at all. And for \nmany of us from States that already have a disproportionate share of \nlow-income individuals who depend on Medicaid services, this could be \ndetrimental to not just those who are surviving Katrina but those who \nare hosting those victims and those survivors as well. The host States \ncould incur large, unexpected increases in their Medicaid costs at the \nsame time their revenues are reduced by the economic dislocation caused \nby Katrina.\n  What we are looking for here is something very similar to what we did \nin New York--to try to provide that flexibility that is needed, \nstreamlining those services, and, more importantly, making sure the \npaperwork is not the mountain of paperwork that so many are used to but \nthat they are simplistic and something that can expedite getting the \nneeds of these individuals met.\n  This is a critical issue that has to be addressed immediately. Our \nStates and our fellow Americans deserve it. To address these crises, I \nhave proposed the temporary disaster relief Medicaid amendment.\n  The amendment, just briefly, is as follows:\n  It would provide the Katrina survivors with health coverage through \nMedicaid wherever they find refuge. A simplified eligibility and \nenrollment process would be created for people from Federal disaster \ncounties in Mississippi and Alabama and Federal disaster parishes in \nLouisiana. It would be extended to those who live in those States and \nwho have lost their jobs since the Hurricane Katrina crisis has \nhappened. This, again, is something very similar to what we did in New \nYork after 9/11. Using what we have learned there, we want to expedite \nthese services for the victims today.\n  We want to make it easy for health providers to care for Katrina \nsurvivors. Once enrolled, Katrina survivors who are in other States \nwould receive Medicaid as though they were Medicaid enrollees in that \nvery State. Medicaid would also temporarily finance people's private \ninsurance if they have access to it. This means no new systems or rules \nfor health care providers so they can again rest assured that they are \nproviding these services and will still be able to maintain their \nwholeness in providing services to their own communities.\n  It would guarantee Federal funding for health care for Katrina \nsurvivors. The Federal Government would fully finance the cost of \nproviding Medicaid to Katrina survivors in any State in which they are \nenrolled. Additionally, the scheduled decline in some States' Medicaid \nmatching rate for fiscal year 2006 would be canceled.\n  Mr. President, you may be certainly well aware, as many of us are \nhere in the Senate, that the Federal matching rate was due to change as \nof October 1 of this year. We want to make sure we extend, for those \nwho are affected, the current Federal matching rate in order to be able \nto maintain their wholeness and for those to be able to continue to \noffer their services, as a good neighbor wants to, to those victims of \nthis crisis. This would continue for 6 months, with a possible \nextension for another 6 months if the need exists and continues.\n  It would also ensure a smooth transition to the Medicare drug benefit \nfor Katrina survivors. In addition, parts of the implementation of the \ndrug benefit would be delayed in States directly affected by the \nhurricane, along with their neighbors. Specifically, the transition of \n``dual eligibles'' from Medicaid to Medicare--as well as the \n``clawback'' payments, which we discussed at great length when we did \nthe Medicare reform package--would be temporarily suspended to prevent \nsurvivors from losing their drug coverage. We have tried--and I know I \nhave in my own home State, having supported the Medicare reform \npackage--to make sure the information is out there for the elderly and \nthe disabled and those who use Medicare as to what their opportunities \nand options are through Medicare, particularly the new Part D Medicare \ndrug component.\n  For the low-income, there is an incredibly good component of the \nMedicare drug piece in the Medicare reform package. All of these are \navailable, but they do have deadlines. They do have deadlines. The \nenrollment begins on November 15 of this year. Those who do not enroll \nin a drug plan by May 15, 2006, this coming spring, will see a premium \npenalty. Many of us have learned, as we have delved into Medicare over \nthe years, that those others receive premium penalties if they don't \nsign up for Medicare on time. We want to make sure those kinds of \npenalties don't exist for victims who find themselves not only \ndisplaced from their families, their homes, their regular medical \nproviders, but also all of their information, their documents, the kind \nof information and certainly the normalcy of life that allows one to go \nthrough that kind of paperwork and try to make the best decisions \npossible.\n\n  The requirement of proof of assets for the low-income drug benefit \nwould be delayed. As we know, many of these individuals have no idea if \ntheir old job will be there; will there be a new job; how long it will \ntake for these businesses to rebuild, to replenish, to be back in \naction. There are so many who are dealing with so much unknown. It is \ncertainly our responsibility, not only as legislators but as fellow \nAmericans, to recognize they need time. They need time and flexibility \nto work through these issues and to access the programs that we have \nvery carefully designed to fit their needs.\n  The penalties for not immediately enrolling in Medicare and its drug \nprogram would also be temporarily suspended. Providing this \nassistance--certainly the dollars Senator Frist spoke of, the ability \nto make sure that the\n\n[[Page S9778]]\n\nvictims, our fellow Americans who have gone through such atrocities, \nand the health care providers in the communities who want to be there \nto serve them, making sure of the technical parts of this recovery--is \nour responsibility. I hope the managers of the bill will understand how \nimportant it is for us to move quickly to ensure that those who are \nproviding the relief and those who are receiving it can take it with \ngreat comfort levels that they won't have to deal with the bureaucracy \nbut that they will be dealing with a compassionate Federal Government \nthat understands the necessity of making this process more streamlined \nand more accessible.\n  It is not only the right thing to do; it is what we must do to ensure \nthat our Nation's safety net does not unravel in the face of this \ngrowing national emergency. We still have the precautions in here. We \nstill have the fraud and abuse precautions that exist in our current \nlaw. We just want to make sure that our fellow man, our fellow \nAmericans, in a time of dire need, as has been described eloquently by \nSenators from those States who have been there with these individuals, \nfor those of us who are from States where they are coming, seeing these \nindividuals coming in--we had a group come in through Fort Chaffee, AR, \nalmost 10,000 evacuees processed in about a 12-hour period, all of whom \ncame with what they had left in a plastic sack, perhaps, who had been \nsitting on buses for almost 2 days while people figured out where they \nshould go, what they should do, where they should be sent, who should \nbe taking care of them. We don't want that to happen in their medical \ncare and in their access to the kind of things that we know they are \ngoing to need now and they are going to need in the coming weeks and \nmonths.\n  I hope we will do our homework quickly. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this amendment to create temporary disaster relief Medicaid \ntoday. I ask them all to think about how they would feel, many of whom \nhave experienced it. Senators from Alabama and Mississippi and \nLouisiana who have lost their homes and have found their family members \ndisplaced can understand how heavy the hearts are of our fellow \nAmericans who have been victimized by this incredible storm. We, in our \nway, can help in bringing down the wall of bureaucracy and redtape to \nallow them the helping hand that we can provide.\n  I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mrs. Lincoln] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1652.\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I am pleased to present to the Senate the \nCommerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies appropriations bill \nfor fiscal year 2006. Since August 25, our Nation has been gripped by \nthe devastation and destruction left in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. \nWe have all watched in horror as this category 4 hurricane ravaged an \nentire region, and each of us share in the sorrow of those who have \nlost their lives and their livelihoods. I am confident that the \nstrength of the American spirit will rise to this challenge and, just \nas we have many times before, that we can and will recover.\n  The bill before us today provides funding for many U.S. Government \nfunctions that are critical to hurricane prediction, response, and \nrecovery. The Small Business Administration provides low-interest loans \nto disaster victims to rebuild their homes and businesses. The Economic \nDevelopment Administration, under the Department of Commerce, can make \nfunds available to distressed communities to help repair their physical \ninfrastructure. Under the Department of Justice, State and local law \nenforcement assistance grants can help provide relief to gulf coast law \nenforcement agencies. Finally, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration is one of three lead agencies responsible for \nresearching, forecasting, monitoring, and warning of hurricanes.\n  It is timely that this bill is being considered on the Senate floor, \nand I commend the leader for recognizing how important it is to send \nthis bill to the President.\n  This afternoon, I want to take a moment to provide some general \nbackground about the bill before us and the programs it funds. The \nreorganization of the Appropriations Committee earlier this year \nsignificantly changed the jurisdiction of the subcommittee. The newly \nformed subcommittee has jurisdiction over the Departments of Justice \nand Commerce, as well as the National Aeronautics and Space \nAdministration, the National Science Foundation, and a number of \nindependent agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission, \nthe Federal Trade Commission, the Federal Communications Commission, \nand the Small Business Administration. The major areas of jurisdiction \nof the CJS bill are counterterrorism, Federal, State, and local law \nenforcement, our Nation's economy, regulation of the banking and \ntelecommunications sectors, scientific research, including programs to \nstudy the oceans and atmosphere, and our Nation's space program.\n  In a year when domestic discretionary dollars are scarce, it has been \nour goal to ensure that the priorities of our Nation and our States are \nmet while remaining within our allocation. I believe we have \naccomplished those savings wherever possible and that we have allocated \nlimited resources to meet the highest priority programs. These \npriorities include bolstering our capabilities for fighting terrorism, \nassisting with law enforcement activities at the State and local level, \nmeasuring and strengthening our Nation's economy, furthering scientific \nresearch, and reforming and reenergizing our Nation's space program. In \nthe wake of three successive hurricanes last year and now Hurricane \nKatrina, we have also taken steps to ensure our Nation's ability to \npredict and monitor hurricanes. And we have done what we reasonably \ncould within our purview to improve our response and recovery \ncapabilities.\n  The total amount recommended is $885 million above the fiscal year \n2005 level at this point in the debate, which is a 2-percent increase. \nThese numbers might suggest that the bill is well below the budget \nrequest. However, the bill does not include the proposed Strengthening \nAmerica's Communities Initiative. The President's budget request for \nthe Department of Commerce included $3.7 billion to implement this new \nprogram. The bill before us does not reflect the President's proposal \nto transfer and significantly reduce these programs.\n  Another noteworthy aspect of the bill is that it includes an increase \nof over $1 billion above the budget request for the Department of \nJustice. This is mainly due to the restoration of the proposed cuts to \nState and local law enforcement grants. I know the Presiding Officer is \nvery involved in that. The bill also recommends nearly $7.2 billion for \nthe Department of Commerce, including NOAA and NIST, which is an 8-\npercent increase over last year's funding level. Many Department of \nCommerce programs were proposed for termination in the President's \nbudget for 2006. Rather than terminating these programs, the bill \nbefore us includes funding for the Economic Development Administration, \nwhich is so important to every State, the public telecommunications \nfacilities, planning and construction grants, and the Technology \nOpportunities Program.\n  In the science title of the bill, we have restored the 8-percent \nreduction from last year's enacted level that was proposed by NOAA. \nThere is continued frustration among many of my Senate colleagues about \nthe Department's repeated request to reduce NOAA funding. NOAA provides \nmany critical functions to hurricane prediction and warning. Further, \nour oceans and atmosphere constitute one of our most precious natural \nresources, and I believe we can all appreciate the importance of both \nto human subsistence. I believe we should be increasing NOAA's budget, \nas the bill does, not cutting it.\n\n  In addition, this bill provides funding for NASA to move forward with \nthe exploration vision while fully funding the ongoing activities of \nthe space shuttle and the International Space Station.\n\n[[Page S9779]]\n\nThe recommendation fully funds constellation systems and provides NASA \nwith funds to prepare a servicing mission to the Hubble space \ntelescope. Many of NASA's facilities in the gulf region sustained \nsignificant damage from Hurricane Katrina, and we have not addressed \nthose issues in this bill. We expect to address them in the next \nsupplemental spending measure that will be considered.\n  Finally, in the related agencies title of the bill, we include full \nfunding for the Securities and Exchange Commission, for the Federal \nCommunications Commission. The recommendation rejects a number of \nproposed program eliminations within the Small Business Administration.\n  This, overall, is a pretty lean bill. We had to work with our \nallocation. We had to make tough decisions to get here. I think my \ncolleagues will find that this bill does support core functions and \neven provides increases where critical. The bill addresses the most \npressing needs that were brought to our attention both by the \nadministration and by my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. Overall \nwe believe we have crafted a bill that reflects the priorities of this \ncommittee, as well as of the entire Senate.\n  I take this opportunity to thank Senator Mikulski, my friend and \ncolleague, who is the ranking member on the committee. We have worked \ntogether this year, as we have in many years, to produce a bill that is \nfair and forward looking under intense time and budget constraints. I \nlook forward to continuing to work with Senator Mikulski on the Senate \nfloor and in the future.\n  I also reiterate the leader's position, which is that we must act on \nthis bill expeditiously. I urge my colleagues to come to the floor and \noffer their amendments. I will try to work with them, but let's act in \na timely manner. Time is of the essence now.\n\n\n               Amendments Nos. 1655 through 1658, en bloc\n\n  Mr. President, I now send a series of amendments to the desk. I ask \nthat the amendments be considered read and agreed to, the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements relating to \nthese amendments be printed in the Record, with all of the above \noccurring en bloc. These amendments have been cleared on both sides of \nthe aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments were agreed to, as follows:\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1655\n\n       On page 144, line 10, strike ``$409,625,000'' and insert \n     ``404,625,000''.\n       On page 152, between line 20 and 21, insert the following: \n     ``United States Travel and Tourism Promotion\n       For necessary expenses of the United States Travel and \n     Tourism Promotion Program, as authorized by section 210 of \n     Public Law 108-7, for programs promoting travel to the United \n     States including grants, contracts, cooperative agreements \n     and related costs, $5,000,000, to remain available until \n     September 30, 2007.''.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1656\n\n (Purpose: To provide funding and personnel for the National Hurricane \n                                Center)\n\n       On page 170, between lines 9 and 10, insert the following:\n       Sec. 304. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, \n     of the amounts made available in this title under the heading \n     ``National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration'' and under \n     the subheading ``operations, research, and facilities'', not \n     less than $5,800,000 shall be made available for the National \n     Hurricane Center and that such amount may be used to employ \n     individuals in 43 full-time equivalent positions at the \n     National Hurricane Center.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1657\n\n       On page 173, beginning in line 2, strike ``: Provided \n     further,'' and all that follows through ``this Act'' in line \n     10.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1658\n\n (Purpose: To expand the disaster loans that shall not be sold by the \n                     Small Business Administration)\n\n       On page 188, line 10, after ``Alaska'' insert ``or North \n     Dakota''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeMint). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have an amendment to this bill that I \nwill be offering shortly along with Senator Smith of Oregon, my \ncosponsor, and cosponsored by Senators Bingaman, Wyden, Feingold, and \nKennedy.\n  This amendment will increase the amount of money going to legal aid \nprograms across the country from $324.5 million to $358.5 million.\n  Again, this amendment will throw a lifeline of legal services \nassistance to people in need.\n  I point out that this is $4 million less than what the Legal Services \nCorporation requested in their budget earlier this year. The reason it \nis slightly less is because we had to do that to get the proper offset \nfor the amendment. Forty-five Members of the Senate, on a strong \nbipartisan basis, sent a letter to the chairman and ranking member \nearlier this year seeking the full funding for legal services, which \nwas $362.5 million. As I said, this amendment is $4 million less than \nwhat 45 Members of the Senate, on a bipartisan basis, requested earlier \nthis year.\n  I also point out that 25 percent of the increase goes specifically to \nthose programs providing assistance to victims of Hurricane Katrina.\n  Even before the devastation and displacement of Katrina, this \nincrease was sorely needed. That is because today, as I stand here, 50 \npercent of the people eligible for legal services in America are being \nturned away because the programs simply are underfunded.\n  Keep in mind, to even be eligible for legal services, one must be \nbelow 125 percent poverty. That means for a family of four, you have to \nhave less than a $23,000-per-year income to even qualify for legal \nservices. Again, we are now turning away half of the families in \nAmerica who need civil legal help who make less than $23,000 a year. \nThat is not justice.\n  Furthermore, the clients served by legal services are overwhelmingly \nfemale. Seventy-two percent of the clients served by legal services are \nwomen, most of whom are seeking help with domestic abuse issues, \nincluding custody, retraining orders, and safe housing.\n  Legal services is also the only assistance most low-income women have \nin getting and keeping safe, habitable housing. It is critical in \nreducing homelessness among women and children.\n  In the last 2 years, cuts to legal services programs have resulted in \nthe loss of funding for 200 attorney positions. Every single one of \nthose attorney positions means at least 385 people a year not able to \nget the legal help they need.\n  To sum it up, last year, legal services was forced to serve 77,000 \nfewer people than they did the year before.\n  The Senate bill before us today, instead of taking a small step to \nfix this injustice, imposes an additional $6 million in cuts to legal \nservices programs. This is simply unacceptable.\n  I don't want anyone here to think this amendment we are offering is a \ndrastic fix to the problem. All this amendment does is restore funding \nfor legal services to the fiscal year 2003 level adjusted for \ninflation. This amendment restores legal services funding to the 2003 \nlevel.\n  If we were serious about providing equal justice under law for all of \nour citizens and providing the resources that legal services really \nneeds, we would restore legal services to the 1995 funding level of \nover $500 million a year.\n  Think about it this way: Since 1995, we have cut legal services, the \nonly civil legal help poor people have in this country, by a third. And \nneed I remind anyone what has happened to poverty since 1995? Has it \ngone down by a third? No; it has gone up. So poverty has gone up, and \nwe have cut legal services by a third since 1995. Unconscionable.\n  This, of course, is the picture legal services was facing before \nHurricane Katrina. Legal services always plays a critical role in a \nnational disaster, but this disaster will impose more burdens and more \nchallenges than ever before. That is why this amendment devotes $8 \nmillion or, as I said, 25 percent of the increase goes to programs \ndirectly helping victims of Hurricane Katrina. Again, is that enough? \nHardly. This will be a small downpayment on the funding that will be \nneeded, and I hope will be provided, in some of the supplemental \nfunding bills coming down the road.\n  I heard the majority leader today saying there is going to be a \nsupplemental on the floor today. I don't know what is in it, but there \nbetter be something in it to help legal services serve the people \ndisplaced. We have to have immediate assistance to these programs to \nhelp assist people in the largest displacement in this country since \nthe Civil War. Think about it: The largest displacement of people since \nthe Civil War.\n\n[[Page S9780]]\n\n  One might say people need food, water, they need clothing, they need \nshelter, they need schooling. Yes, they need all those immediate needs. \nBut here is why they are going to need legal services immediately, not \na year from now.\n\n  Let me share with you an e-mail from the State director of the \nAlabama program, one of the hardest hit States, describing what they \nwill be doing in the next few weeks:\n\n     . . . legal services programs are traditionally a critical \n     partner in long-term disaster response. We will be doing \n     everything from trying to clear title for FEMA award purposes \n     (many low-income folks land in houses passed from generation \n     to generation without any formal conveyance . . . ); to \n     contractor fraud; to handling credit problems for folks who \n     are trying to get SBA or other loans with which to rebuild \n     their lives. Not only will we be helping victims of Hurricane \n     Katrina [in this State], but there are over 35,000 evacuees \n     from Louisiana and Mississippi in the State. Every one of our \n     offices in the State will be serving Hurricane Katrina \n     victims with already scarce resources.\n\n  So it is not something they are going to need a year or two from now, \nthey need it now because, in the initial stages, legal services will be \nresponsible for helping hundreds of thousands of people navigate the \nsystem for obtaining disaster-related food stamps, unemployment \ncompensation, and housing assistance. They will be on the frontlines \nrepresenting people with the agencies to get the needed relief.\n  Legal services will be the best on-the-ground arbiters of whether \ndeadlines need to be extended to reach the hundreds of thousands \neligible for assistance.\n  I have a little experience in this from both standpoints: One, I was \na legal services attorney before I came to Congress. That was my job. \nSo I know a little bit about how legal services work and who they \nserve. Second, our State of Iowa in 1993 was hit by a devastating \nflood. Every single one of our counties--99 counties--was declared a \ndisaster area. Some of our small towns were totally wiped out.\n  So I have a great deal of sympathy and empathy for what is going on \nin New Orleans. We saw whole towns in our State underwater. Some of \nthem were never rebuilt. We had to move people to other places.\n  That was 1993. Legal aid lawyers represented thousands of clients in \nthe State of Iowa in landlord-tenant disputes about the ability to \nterminate leases of uninhabitable property. They assisted people in \nIowa with a whole range of issues.\n  In one example, there was a certain FEMA determination that a woman \nwas not entitled to compensation because the property was in the name \nof an ex-spouse. It turned out it was not an ex-spouse; it was her \nspouse who had died, and only legal services could help clear this up \nfor this poor woman. She didn't have enough money to hire an attorney. \nAs I said, to be qualified, one has to have an income of less than 25 \npercent of the poverty level.\n  Another example of what they did in Iowa: FEMA determinations that \nmassive property damages were, in fact, preexisting conditions; \ndeterminations of SBA loan eligibility.\n  This all happened in Iowa in 1993, so I know what it means to go \nthrough a devastating flood such as this and to have people who are \nhomeless, without housing, with no place to go and needing the help of \nlegal services to navigate, to find out what they can get, to know for \nwhat they are eligible.\n  In the situation we are now facing, much bigger than the flood of \nIowa, legal services lawyers will be trying to represent clients who \nhave no access to their homes, many who are temporarily living out of \nState. At least that did not happen in Iowa, at least not to any great \nextent. There are evacuees in Texas, in Arkansas, some in Washington, \nDC. Providing legal help to those most in need is critical in this \ninstance.\n  Beyond the immediate need of helping the victims of Hurricane \nKatrina, legal services is critical to reducing violence in this \ncountry. When people cannot get results through the legal system, they \nresort to extralegal means. We have seen that in all areas of the \ncountry. We have seen that sometimes in disaster areas in the last \nweek, and we should expect to see more if we cannot quickly get legal \nhelp to the people displaced.\n  It is not true because of Hurricane Katrina; it is true in everyday \ndisputes. Having access to quality legal help reduces tensions, focuses \npeople on compromise, negotiations. Legal services reduces the burdens \non our courts. They help to ensure that those people with disabilities \nget the benefits to which they are entitled.\n  That is why the Legal Services Program has the complete support of \nthe American Bar Association and every State bar in the United States. \nI point out that the American Bar Association supports the amendment we \nare offering.\n  Let me add that this amendment is fully offset, as it stands now.\n  I want to also add Senator Obama as a cosponsor to this amendment.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. As I said, 45 \nSenators signed a letter earlier this year seeking this level of \nfunding; $4 million actually more than what we are asking for in this \namendment.\n  So I hope and trust that we will hold this in conference. We cannot \ncontinue to say we are a nation of equal justice under law when the \npoverty rate keeps going up and the amount of money we are giving the \nLegal Services keeps going down. Poor people are being excluded from \nour civil justice system. That is wrong. It should not happen in this \ncountry.\n  So this year, next year, the year after, I will be here, and I am \nsure along with many others on both sides of the aisle, saying we have \nto get this funding back up. Our courts are plugged with people \nsometimes with crimes that have to do with property. How many of those \nmight have been forestalled if they had had Legal Services help--or \ncourts plugged because someone is there because of domestic violence. \nIt could have been forestalled if people had had Legal Services.\n  So that is why we need to get the Legal Services Corporation back up \nto the level it was at least in the mid-1990s, and actually it probably \nshould be more than that because of the huge increase in poverty in \nthis country.\n  So if my colleagues believe in equal justice under law, if they \nbelieve an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, if they \nbelieve by a little bit of money upfront helping people solve their \nlegal problems, domestic violence problems, and things like that it \nwill help keep people out of court, which we have proven is true, then \nwe ask for support for this amendment, and hopefully we can hold this \namount when we go to conference.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1659\n\n  I send the amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nlaid aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin], for himself, Mr. Smith, \n     Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. \n     Obama, proposes an amendment numbered 1659.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To increase the appropriation for nationwide legal services \n field programs and to provide additional funds to programs providing \n          legal services to the victims of Hurricane Katrina)\n\n       On page 175, strike lines 6 through 9 and insert the \n     following:\n       For payment to the Legal Services Corporation to carry out \n     the purposes of the Legal Services Corporation Act of 1974, \n     $358,527,000, of which $346,251,000 is for basic field \n     programs and required independent audits (of which $8,000,000 \n     is for basic field programs providing legal assistance to \n     victims of Hurricane Katrina)\n\n     Notwithstanding any other provisions in the Act, the sums \n     appropriated for the Department of Justice are reduced by $37 \n     million. This reduction is to be taken by the Attorney \n     General from accounts receiving an increase in travel and \n     transportation of persons as specified in the President's \n     Fiscal Year 2006 Budget Submittal to Congress pursuant to 31 \n     U.S.C. section 1105 and which are in excess of the fiscal \n     year 2005 level;\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to speak in support of \nSenator Harkin's amendment to add $38.2 million to the reported funding \nlevel for the Legal Services Corporation, and am\n\n[[Page S9781]]\n\nproud to join him as a cosponsor. I was one of 47 colleagues joining in \na bipartisan letter in June urging the subcommittee to support the \nLegal Service Corporation quest for $363.8 million.\n  Liberty and justice for all is one of America's most cherished \nprinciples, and a fundamental part of the very fabric of our Nation. \nOur Founding Fathers fought a revolution for it. Thousands of brave men \nand women since then--from Abraham Lincoln to Susan B. Anthony to \nMartin Luther King and all who fought with them--risked their lives to \nensure that the principle of justice for all truly applied to all \nAmericans. And today, thousands of men and women of our armed forces \nare fighting and sacrificing their own lives to secure these freedoms \nfor the people of Afghanistan and Iraq.\n  Justice for all knows no political exclusivity. It is not a Democrat \nor Republican value, but an American value. At the opening of each and \nevery session of this Senate, we stand together and pledge our \nallegiance to this founding principle. Millions of schoolchildren \npledge their allegiance every day to this fundamental tenet of our \ncountry.\n  Yet today in Illinois and throughout the United States, we are \nfalling far short of fulfilling our Nation's promise of ``justice for \nall.''\n  A recently released study, ``The Legal Aid Safety Net: A Report on \nthe Legal Needs of Low-Income Illinoisans,'' found that over the course \nof a year, tens of thousands of less fortunate Illinois residents were \nunable to obtain legal assistance that was often critical to their \nsafety and independence. Hundreds of thousands more attempted to solve \noften complex legal problems on their own.\n  Studies in other parts of the country have reached similar \nconclusions. Millions of Americans are being shut out of our civil \njustice system, with grave consequences for themselves personally and \nfor our country as a whole when legal assistance is not available to \nthem. We are a long way from fulfilling our Nation's promise of equal \njustice for all.\n  This widespread lack of access to justice can only be described as a \ncrisis for our country, and with increases in the poverty rate \ncompounded by the vast devastation to so many of our fellow citizens \ncaused by Hurricane Katrina, it will only get worse if we do not act.\n  Those being left behind by the alarming gap in access to our justice \nsystem are our friends, relatives and neighbors. They are children, \nfamilies and the elderly of diverse creeds and backgrounds, and they \noften are the men and women fighting for our country and their \nfamilies.\n  The story of a young man in our armed forces from Galesburg, a small \ncity in the western part of Illinois, is a prime illustration. Before \nbeing deployed to Iraq, he visited Prairie State Legal Services, an \norganization funded by the Legal Services Corporation that serves \nresidents in 36 mostly rural counties in northern Illinois, to seek \nhelp in getting a power of attorney and will prepared so that if \nsomething happened to him his family would know what to do.\n  Other examples of the Americans who are helped every day by legal aid \ngroups funded by the Legal Services Corporation--and for too many of \nwhom help is not available--include a woman and her children victimized \nby domestic violence seeking an order of protection and child support \nto give them a fair chance to start a new life, a senior couple facing \nforeclosure of the only home they have ever lived in after being \nvictimized by consumer fraud, a World War II veteran who served his \ncountry so well but now is being denied the benefits we have promised \nhim, and numerous other less fortunate residents facing legal matters \ncritical to their safety and independence as they try to pursue the \nAmerican dream.\n  The legal aid system in Illinois is able to address only a small \nfraction of the civil legal problems encountered by low-income \nIllinoisans. The ``safety net'' is inadequate and fraying. Low-income \nIllinoisans faced over 1.3 million civil legal problems in 2003--from \nchild custody disputes to mortgage foreclosure to physical and \nfinancial elder abuse. Low-income Illinoisans had the assistance of an \nattorney for only one of every six legal problems they encountered. \nIllinois's legal aid system is facing critical shortage of resources, \nwith layoffs and hiring freezes becoming widespread at programs \nthroughout the State.\n  The Legal Services Corporation has historically been grossly \nunderfunded. In 1996, Congress reduced funding by 33 percent--from $415 \nmillion to $278 million, resulting in closure of more than 100 legal \naid offices across the country. By fiscal year 2003, the appropriation \nhad been increased to $338.8 million, but levels have steadily declined \nas a result of Government-wide reductions.\n  The Legal Services Corporation has already had to absorb $9 million \nin cuts over the last 2 years. That translates to almost 200 attorney \npositions across the country who are no longer helping those in need of \nlegal assistance. Just in the last 2 years, the number of people that \nwere able to receive needed services declined from 978,000 to 901,000. \nThree States are experiencing layoffs and many other States have a \nhiring freeze in place that has led to as many as one third of the \nstaffing positions being vacant.\n  While it is not the Federal Government's responsibility to be the \nsole source of legal aid funding, the Federal Government has a \nsignificant role to play in partnership with State and local \ngovernments, the legal community and other public and private sources.\n  The need and the cost effectiveness of increased funding for civil \nlegal aid have been amply demonstrated. The excuse that there is not \nenough money is no longer acceptable. We are failing to protect the \nlegal rights of too many of our most vulnerable residents.\n  But if Congress adopts the Harkin amendment reflecting the bipartisan \nLegal Services Corporation Board's funding request, it would mean \nalmost $1 million in additional funding for Illinois programs over last \nyear's appropriation and thereby ensure services for thousands of \nlower-income Illinois residents.\n  By contrast, if the appropriation remains at the $324 million level \nin the underlying bill we are considering, it will result in additional \ncuts of more than $200,000 for Illinois programs. Attorneys throughout \nIllinois already contribute more than $5 million annually to civil \nlegal aid, as well as providing hundreds of thousands of hours of pro \nbono services. While members of the legal community must continue to be \nleaders in this effort, they cannot do it alone. Congress must step up \nto the plate.\n  Access to and availability of legal services will be even more acute \nin the coming months as thousands of victims of the devastation in the \nwake of Hurricane Katrina grapple with housing, unemployment, and other \ncomplicated assistance programs. Prior to Hurricane Katrina, there was \nalready a critical need for an increase in the budget for legal \nservices programs. Between March and May of 2005, legal service \nprograms across the country were forced to turn away 50 percent of \npeople eligible for assistance. An additional 20 percent were forced to \nmake due with less legal help than necessary.\n  By adopting this very modest amendment offered by Senator Harkin, we \ncan ensure that tens of thousands more Americans like those I described \nhave access to critical legal services that will enable them to \ncontinue to be independent and productive members of our communities.\n  Senator Harkin's amendment would merely restore Legal Services \nCorporation funding to its level from 2 years ago when adjusted for \ninflation. It is only a modest increase from last year's $335 million \npre-rescission funding level, yet it would help ensure services for \ntens of thousands of Americans are protected. It will help give them \naccess to reliable web-based legal information and resources, legal aid \nhotlines, and extended representation by legal aid attorneys in more \ncomplex matters.\n  I hope we will all join in full support of Senator Harkin's \nreasonable amendment. Let's demonstrate that ``justice for all'' is a \nmeaningful commitment--and never becomes a meaningless cliche.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President. I rise in strong support of the amendment \noffered by Senator Harkin to increase funding for the Legal Services \nCorporation. I am proud to be a cosponsor of the amendment.\n  The Legal Services Corporation provides vital legal assistance to the \npoor\n\n[[Page S9782]]\n\naround the country. It was created in 1974 with bipartisan \ncongressional sponsorship and the support of the Nixon administration.\n  In Chicago, the Legal Services Corporation funds make it possible for \nthe Legal Assistance Foundation to help my constituents navigate the \nfoster care system and receive compensation after violent crimes. In \nGalesburg and Peoria, these funds make it possible for the Prairie \nState Legal Services organization to help people dealing with domestic \nviolence issues and elder abuse.\n  In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, you can bet that Legal \nServices Corporation will be in Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, and \nthe many States where hurricane victims are being relocated helping \nnewly impoverished citizens obtain food and shelter assistance, health \ncare and insurance benefits, unemployment insurance, Social Security \nbenefits, and FEMA assistance.\n  This program makes a real difference in people's lives. Take the \nstory of Irene and her family for example, who live in Section 8 \nhousing and needed help. They visited the Prairie State Legal Services \noffice in Illinois. Every day, Irene had to get two wheelchair-bound \ngrandchildren up the stairs and into a second floor apartment. Both her \ngrandchildren have cerebral palsy and are confined to wheelchairs. The \noldest is now 14 and weighs 160 lbs. And after 11 years, as I am sure \nyou can imagine, Irene was having a hard time getting her grandchildren \nup those stairs. But when she tried to make this difficult situation \nbetter, it only got worse.\n  Irene applied for and received a transfer certificate from Section 8 \nto allow her to move to a new apartment. But she could not find a \nfirst-floor apartment to transfer to within the 60 days that the \ntransfer allowed. Irene tried calling the Section 8 offices to let them \nknow of the delay, but she was forced to leave messages. When she \nfinally sent a letter asking for a response to her messages, she was \ninformed that she was too late--not only was the Public Housing Agency \nterminating her transfer, it was also terminating the Section 8 subsidy \nfor her current apartment.\n  But that is when Prairie State and Legal Services Corporation \nintervened. A staff attorney represented Irene in an administrative \nappeal, and pointed out that under the Fair Housing Act and the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act, Irene had not been provided the \nsupport needed to assist her in finding an apartment. As a result of \nher attorney's efforts, Irene's subsidy was reinstated, she was given a \nnew transfer certificate and was provided with active assistance in \nhelping her find a new apartment.\n  Legal Services Corporation helps folks like Irene all across the \ncountry, from South Carolina to South Dakota, Illinois to Iowa. And \nwhen someone displaced by Hurricane Katrina cannot afford a lawyer but \nis having trouble getting her unemployment insurance or Social Security \nbenefits, or getting her utilities turned back on, Legal Services \nCorporation will be right there. Legal Services Corporation-funded \norganizations have won dozens of awards, and groups ranging from AARP \nto the American Bar Association have voiced their strong support of \nLSC. We should do the same.\n  Over the last decade, the LSC budget has suffered $196 million in \ncuts. The Appropriations Committee proposed this year to cut $6 million \nmore. I do not think this is the time to deny legal services to those \nwho need them most. I believe that in light of the pressing crises \nconfronting individuals in the gulf coast, we should be increasing \nfunding for the Legal Services Corporation, not decreasing it. So I \nstrongly support Senator Harkin's amendment, and I urge my colleagues \nto do the same.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the amendment \nintroduced by my colleague, Senator Harkin, from Iowa, which would \nincrease funding for the Legal Services Corporation by $38.2 million to \n$363 million.\n  If there was ever a time to provide adequate funding for legal \nservices for the poor, that time is now.\n  In the wake of Hurricane Katrina, there will be thousands and \nthousands of Americans in desperate need of legal advice who lack the \nresources to hire their own attorneys or the skills necessary to meet \nthe legal challenges they must confront.\n  These are the same folks that didn't have the means to get out of \nharm's way when the hurricane struck.\n  These are the same folks that waited for days on their rooftops, at \nthe New Orleans Convention Center, the Superdome, and so many other \nplaces down on the Gulf Coast to be rescued.\n  These are the same folks that now must rebuild their lives--often \ntimes from scratch.\n  They will need legal assistance. Congress needs to step in and help \nmake this a reality. And Congress needs to step and increase funding so \nthat the thousands of other Americans--in addition to the victims of \nKatrina--who are unable to afford legal advice get the access to \njustice that they deserve.\n  How can it be, in a country where we teach our children from an early \nage the Pledge of Allegiance and its closing words--``with liberty and \njustice for all''--so many children and their families cannot obtain \nequal access to justice?\n  How can it be, in a country that saw an historic economic boom in the \nlast decade, that 80 percent of low-income Americans still lack access \nto a lawyer when they're in serious legal situations?\n  How can it be, in a country as strong and rich as this one, that tens \nof thousands of Americans who need legal representation are turned away \nevery year because their Government won't support the very program \ndesigned to help them?\n  This year, the House has appropriated only $324.5 million in funding \nfor Legal Services. The current version of the Senate CJS \nAppropriations bill funds the program at about the same level.\n  This is less than Legal Services received in FY 2005. It's almost $40 \nmillion less than the FY 2006 budget request made by the bipartisan \nLegal Services Corporation Board of Directors. In fact, the current \nlevel of funding is not much more than it was in 1981--in real dollars.\n  The issues that Legal Aid works to address are not esoteric legal \nquestions. They are issues of life and death and food and shelter.\n  When folks who are already hurting can't get the legal representation \nthey need, all too often it gets harder to put food on the table and \nharder to pay the rent and harder to get the medicine for the kids or \nfor Grandma.\n  In the State of Oregon, the need for legal aid is clear, and the \nchoice to fund it should be obvious. Oregon's Legal Aid programs are \nthe primary source of representation available to more than 500,000 \nlow-income folks in my State, and they assist 20,000 of those low-\nincome Oregonians every year.\n  But because of Legal Aid funding shortfalls in recent years, the \nOregon programs have had to layoff staff, cut salaries for remaining \nstaff, slash their medical benefits, freeze vacancies, and close the \nKlamath Falls office. Less than 20 percent of low income Oregonians \nhave access to an attorney who could make a critical difference in \nhelping them deal with a legal issue--from a getting restraining order \nfrom an abusive boyfriend to helping a predatory lending victim.\n  The idea that Legal Aid is the practice of political law is \npreposterous.\n  It's simply making sure that legal services are available for the \nvery people who need them most.\n  Make no mistake--State, local and private resources are providing the \nvast majority of Legal Aid funding in Oregon and elsewhere. In 1980, \nFederal funding accounted for 80 percent of the total legal aid money \nin Oregon. In 2005, Federal funding accounts for 28 percent. Everyone \nelse is doing their part to provide these folks with equal access to \njustice--it's time that the Federal Government did its part too.\n  I am determined that the victims of Hurricane Katrina and poor \nAmericans throughout the United States, who, as children, stood in \ntheir classrooms with their hands over their hearts and recited the \nPledge of Allegiance and the words ``with liberty and justice for all'' \nwill not find out those words were a lie.\n  I am determined that the victims of Hurricane Katrina living in the \nHouston Astrodome will have legal help they need when applying for food\n\n[[Page S9783]]\n\nstamps and other forms of assistance available to them.\n  I am determined that the victims of Hurricane Katrina relocated to \nSan Antonio will get legal help they need to deal with their insurance \ncompanies.\n  I am determined that the victims of Hurricane Katrina spread all \nacross the country will get the legal assistance they need to rebuild \ntheir homes--and their lives.\n  With Federal, State and local partners working together, we can \nensure equal access to the law for all Americans, including the \nthousands and thousands of victims of Hurricane Katrina.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator from Iowa for \noffering this amendment. I know he has been a passionate supporter of \nLegal Services and quite frankly so have I over the years, having used \nit when I was a social worker in Baltimore and a child abuse worker, I \nmight add, when many of these children had very little protection, the \nkind of protection we have now.\n  Legal Services will perform services at multiple levels. One is the \ntraditional services in all 50 States. No. 2, though, they will be very \nimportant now to people with Katrina, particularly those who are \nunfamiliar with paperwork and bureaucracy and applying and all of those \nthings and will need someone to help them navigate.\n  One might ask, why would they need a lawyer? Legal Services offers \nmore than lawyers, and they will be there. I think the Senator's \namendment is excellent. I think what we need to be able to do is find \nboth the will and the wallet to fully support Legal Services.\n  When I think back on what Legal Services has meant, it often helped \npeople get their lives together. I know in my own case as a social \nworker, it helped a welfare mother get a divorce from an abusive \nhusband. It helped her be able to clear up all of her credit issues so \nthat she could begin a new life. She got a GED so she could move off of \nwelfare and establish herself. The credit card mess was due to the \nabusive husband. So Legal Services, really, in many instances helps \nfamilies get their lives together.\n  So we look forward to supporting this amendment and working with him \non other advocacy issues.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1652\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the amendment \noffered by Senator Lincoln to ensure that victims of this terrible \nhurricane have access to the health care their situation demands today. \nThis is the least we can do, and I urge Senators to support her \namendment.\n  I was moved to hear the words of Senator Landrieu this morning. She \nhas been a tireless warrior for her State throughout her career, and I \ncommend her for her work and her efforts over the last tragic days she \nhas been through in Louisiana. To her and to my other colleagues, to \nSenator Lott, Senator Cochran, Senator Vitter, Senator Sessions, and \nSenator Shelby, I simply say we should do everything in our power as a \nSenate to help the victims of this terrible storm and to help rebuild \ntheir States, cities, and communities.\n  Let me say, too, that I am proud of Coloradans and their response to \nthis disaster. In the 10 days since the devastating storm hit the \nshores off the gulf coast, people of our State have stepped up to help \nthe victims.\n  Experts from the national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \nlaboratory in Fort Collins will be dispatched to the region soon. \nDisease trackers from Fort Collins likely will be sent to the gulf \ncoast to help contain the spread of the West Nile virus and the spread \nof other mosquito-borne illnesses in the aftermath of Hurricane \nKatrina. The U.S. Northern Command at Peterson Air Force Base, which is \ncharged with defending against military attacks within our borders, is \nnow charged with mobilizing military resources for the Hurricane \nKatrina disaster. The U.S. Joint Operations Center in Colorado Springs \nhas nearly 1,000 people on 24-hour duty to facilitate Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency requests.\n  I am proud of the men and women in uniform who today are helping our \ncountry within our borders.\n  Nearly 800 Colorado National Guard men and women are deployed to that \nregion today. Churches in Denver and throughout the State of Colorado \nare mobilizing to help with relief efforts, whether that means \ncollecting donations, physically traveling to the devastated \ncommunities, or taking in displaced refugees. The University of \nColorado has started a streamlined admissions process for students \ntemporarily displaced by Hurricane Katrina. Colorado State University \nhas taken similar steps.\n  The American Red Cross Mile High Chapter, which houses the Nation's \nsecond largest disaster response phone operation and which for a time \nwas handling one-third of the calls pouring into the Red Cross national \nheadquarters in Washington, DC, has done a tremendous job, and in the \nimmediate aftermath of the storm more than 800 Coloradans volunteered \nto receive training and field phone calls and take donations for the \nRed Cross. My wife Hope and my daughter Melinda and I visited the \nDenver operation last week and helped man the phones. I could not have \nbeen more proud of our State and its people. I am sure the experience \nof Colorado is an experience that has gone across all of our 50 States \nof our great Nation.\n  I remember Sunday, August 28, very well. The country held its \ncollective breath as we awaited landfall of Hurricane Katrina. In my \nfaith, we celebrate Feast Days of Saints, symbols of the kinds of lives \nCatholics aspire to lead. Sunday, August 28, was the Feast Day of Saint \nAugustine, an intellectual giant in our church who became so only after \nbattling great personal challenges in his own personal life. Augustine \nhad an important piece of advice for all of us that is applicable \ntoday. He said:\n\n       Pray, as though everything depended on God. Work as though \n     everything depended on you.\n\n  One look at the devastation in the gulf coast--the destruction \nwrought in Biloxi, MS, the obliteration of towns all along the \nMississippi coast, and the suffering in New Orleans and across \nLouisiana--and none of us could have imagined that kind of devastation \ncould ever occur here in our homeland. We cannot help but feel that the \nreconstruction of this wonderful part of our country will depend not \nonly on our human powers but also on the supernatural powers that will \nguide us.\n  But seeing the suffering on the faces of our fellow countrymen, \nwomen, and children, you cannot feel anything but to be ready to work \nas if the end of their suffering depends on our work. In point of fact, \nthose suffering people depend on us to end their suffering, and we owe \nit to them to work as though everything depends on us. I submit that a \nbasic function of the Federal Government is to respond to a national \ndisaster such as Katrina which has devastated 90,000 square miles of \nAmerica.\n  We can and we must do everything we can. I submit we should take on \nour challenge in three critical ways. First, we must provide immediate \nhumanitarian assistance. Second, the President should lead a Marshall-\nlike plan to reconstruct the gulf coast region. Third, we must learn \nthe lessons from the Katrina disaster so we can prevent these kinds of \ndisasters from happening elsewhere in our great Nation.\n  Let me review each of those points. First, by providing immediate \nhumanitarian aid and assistance to the victims of this terrible \ndisaster, we should be doing what is our duty as a nation. Last week, \nCongress provide FEMA $10.5 billion in emergency funding. Today, we \nanticipate we will provide\n\n[[Page S9784]]\n\nanother $51.8 billion for this national disaster. Passing these \nappropriations will help the victims of Hurricane Katrina, and it is \nthe right thing to do. I am proud we are taking these steps.\n  At the same time, the Federal Government can and should do more. That \nis why I commend Senators Reid and Landrieu for introducing the Katrina \nEmergency Relief Plan earlier today. I am proud to cosponsor that \nlegislation, and I urge my colleagues to join us in immediately passing \nthis much needed relief for the victims.\n  We can take that first step now by passing Senator Lincoln's proposed \namendment. The people of our great Nation have the right to expect and \ndeserve the best emergency and disaster response services in the world. \nIt is the responsibility of the Federal Government to protect its \ncitizens, and in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina much more needs to \nbe done to live up to that responsibility.\n  The Katrina Emergency Relief Plan is the right first step. I also \nwill continue to press for additional immediate relief, including: \nfirst, an emergency appropriation for CDC, for disease surveillance and \nmitigation; second, immediate assistance to States for those \nuniversities and school districts, such as those in Colorado, that take \non displaced students from Katrina-affected elementary, middle, high \nschools, and university settings; third, an expansion of the cap on the \namount of charitable donations that can be claimed for tax purposes \nwhen those donations are given for Hurricane Katrina responses; fourth, \na fix in the Tax Code to permit the expenses associated with the \nprovision of room and board to victims of Hurricane Katrina to be tax \ndeductible; and, finally, exempting the victims of Hurricane Katrina \nfrom the means test under the new bankruptcy law due to take effect on \nOctober 17 of this year.\n\n  Second, we must respond to this disaster by creating a Marshall plan \nfor reconstruction of the gulf coast. From jazz to William Faulkner, \nthese affected States have given much to our country and to our \nhistory. As such, I cannot imagine that anyone would not consider \ninvesting the resources necessary to rebuild this vital part of our \ngreat country. We owe it to our fellow countrymen and people on the \ngulf coast.\n  This will require a recovery and reconstruction effort on the scale \nof the Marshall plan that rebuilt Europe after World War II. Not unlike \npost-World War II Europe, the Gulf States are now facing unprecedented \ndamages which require immediate action. Entire towns in Mississippi \nwere destroyed and it will take months to make New Orleans and other \ncommunities in Louisiana habitable again.\n  Such a plan should include the creation of a small and effective \nCabinet member-chaired task force--that the President would appoint--\nwith State and local participation, and that task force would have a \nsingular focus on this challenge. The task force should develop a plan \nfor reconstruction, identify the costs associated with that plan, and \noversee its successful implementation.\n  In addition, I recommend getting our hands around the pain at the \npump created by the record high gas prices, and the impact they are \nhaving on our country, including consumers, farmers, ranchers, and \nbusinesses. A first step in that effort is for the Department of \nJustice to provide assistance, both technical and financial, to State \nattorneys general to fight price gouging and contractor fraud, and \nfreeze any requirements for small businesses and farmers affected by \nKatrina to service Small Business Administration and USDA loans or any \nother Federal Government-provided loans until the affected areas can be \nreconstructed.\n  If we are to have a Marshall plan, we also will need to have a leader \nof the caliber of General George C. Marshall. That is why I repeat \ntoday my request to the President that he seek the resignation of \nMichael Brown, the FEMA Director, and replace him with a leader who has \nthe experience and expertise to meet the challenges of the greatest \nnatural disaster in our country's history.\n  Thirdly, we must expeditiously determine what happened in response to \nthis disaster and how we should reform FEMA and our Federal agencies to \nensure that this slow response does not happen again.\n  I have already joined my colleagues in calling for an independent \ncommission to investigate the Federal response to Hurricane Katrina and \nhow we can be better prepared for future cataclysmic events. This \neffort can be helpful, and, as was the case in the wake of the terrible \n9/11 terrorist attacks, we can, in fact, do something to learn the \nlessons we must learn.\n  But what we do not need is a partisan investigation that produces \npredetermined results. Remember the history of the 9/11 Commission, the \nmost bipartisan and successful commission in a long time. It was only \nagainst the backdrop of opposition from the White House and after \nmonths of calls from the families of the victims of 9/11 that the \ncommission was created, and, once created, that commission did its job.\n  I hope we can avoid the partisan wrangling this time around and get a \ncommission that gets right to work on this very important effort.\n  I will also propose legislation to improve training for evacuation \nand relocation in reaction to natural or manmade disasters. We often \ncannot predict when natural disasters will strike, but we must begin \npreparation for future incidents without further delay.\n  I hope, too, that the conferees on the Homeland Security will keep in \nthat conference report my amendment to require a national survey of \nfirst responders. I recently conducted such a survey of Colorado's \nfirst responders and was appalled at the result which demonstrated how \nunprepared our first responders are in dealing with these kinds of \ndisasters. Given what we have seen in the last 10 days--where the \nFederal Government's response has without question failed--we need to \nhear directly from the police, firefighters, and others how we can \nimprove our response.\n  In closing, I am reminded of another saying by Saint Augustine. He \nasked:\n\n       What does love look like? It has the hands to help others. \n     It has the feet to hasten to the poor and the needy. It has \n     eyes to see misery and want. It has the ears to hear the \n     sighs and sorrows of men. That is what love looks like.\n\n  The victims of this terrible tragedy love this country, but this \ncountry has let them down. It is now time for this Senate, this \nCongress, and this President, who runs the executive branch, to get to \nwork to rectify that letdown.\n  We are this great country's hands, and we can do more to help those \nvictims. We are this great country's feet, and we can do more to carry \nassistance to those victims. We are this great country's eyes, and we \nmust see what they are suffering through. We are this great country's \nears, and we cannot turn a deaf ear to the pleas from the gulf coast.\n  We can do better, and I look forward to working with all of my \ncolleagues to ensure that we do.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of \na quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1654\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendments and call up amendment numbered 1654.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Dayton], for himself, and \n     Mr. Chambliss, Mr. Obama, Mr. Kerry, and Mr. Harkin, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 1654.\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The amendment (No. 1654) is as follows:\n\n      (Purpose: To increase funding for Justice Assistance Grants)\n\n       On page 133, line 24, strike ``$1,078,350,000'' and insert \n     ``$1,353,350,000 of which in addition to amounts provided by \n     the following table $275,000,000 shall be available for \n     Justice Assistance Grants to be offset by reducing \n     appropriations in this title by a total of $275,000,000 to \n     come from activities as follows: $43,000,000 from travel and \n     transportation of persons; $3,000,000 from transportation of \n     things; $27,000,000 from communications, utilities, and \n     miscellaneous charges;\n\n[[Page S9785]]\n\n     $6,000,000 from printing and reproduction; and $196,000,000 \n     from other services''.\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. I thank the distinguished ranking member for assistance \nin putting this together. I thank my distinguished cosponsor of this \namendment, Senator Chambliss of Georgia, for his leadership and \ninvolvement in the Byrne Grants, along with Senator Lieberman whose \nlong-time involvement in the grants has been recognized nationally.\n  It is my understanding the amendment is further cosponsored by \nSenator Obama, Senator Kerry, and Senator Harkin, and I ask unanimous \nconsent Senators Hagel, Clinton, Cantwell, and Salazar be added as \noriginal cosponsors of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, this amendment increases the funding for \nthe Juvenile Assistance Grants by $275 million, with particular focus \non adding that funding to what are called the Byrne Grants, which are \nlocal law enforcement grants vital in my State of Minnesota for \nfighting the scourge of meth that has ravaged communities, that has \nbeen so destructive to schoolchildren of all ages, I am sorry to say, \nparticularly teenagers and young adults.\n  The illegal meth used in production in Minnesota has increased in a \nskyrocketing fashion. I understand that is true in many other States as \nwell. These Byrne Grants have been essential to Minnesota and other law \nenforcement efforts to provide the funds necessary to combat the \nscourge. The funds go to local law enforcement block grants.\n  The Byrne Formula Grants consolidated into the Justice Assistance \nGrant have been reduced in the last couple of years. This restores \nbadly needed funding for those purposes. I commend the chairman of the \nsubcommittee and the ranking member for providing $625 million of \nfunding that is well above what the House of Representatives has \nprovided, $348 million.\n  This money is desperately needed and will be well used. My amendment \nis fully offset by various reductions in administrative expenses. I can \ndetail those if Members desire, but it will be fully offset, and has \nbeen determined as such by the Congressional Budget Office.\n  I ask unanimous consent, at the conclusion of my remarks, the \nfollowing letters of endorsement from the national organizations be \nadded: The National Association of Police Officers, the International \nAssociation of Chiefs of Police, the Minnesota Sheriff's Association, \nthe Minnesota Police and Peace Officers Association.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1).\n  Mr. DAYTON. I ask my colleagues to support this bipartisan effort. I \nbelieve they will find, as I have, this has almost unanimous support of \nlocal law enforcement officials in their States, as it does in mine. \nThe funding is desperately needed, and it will be well used and go to \nour communities, to our counties, to our States in ways that will be \ndirectly involved in reducing juvenile crime as well as other forms of \ncrime.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                          The National Association\n\n\n                                           of Police Officers,\n\n                                                September 8, 2005.\n     Re Dayton Amendment re JAG funding.\n\n     Office of Senator Dayton,\n     Washington, DC.\n       NAPO supports Senator Dayton's amendment to increase JAG \n     funding by $275 million. The Justice Assistance Grants have \n     provided beneficial support for local law enforcement, \n     fostered community initiatives against crime and facilitated \n     improvements to State criminal justice systems. We thank the \n     Senator for his continued work to ensure that local law \n     enforcement is afforded the ability to receive the effective \n     and user-friendly funds it Deeds the most.\n       Please keep me posted on how the amendment fares today.\n           Thank you.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         International Association\n\n\n                                          of Chiefs of Police,\n\n                                                September 6, 2005.\n     Hon. Mark Dayton,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dayton: On behalf of the International \n     Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP), I am writing to \n     express our support for your amendment to restore funding to \n     the Justice Accountability Grant (JAG) program. As you know, \n     the IACP is the world's oldest and largest association of law \n     enforcement executives with more than 20,000 members in 100 \n     countries.\n       The JAG program, which was formed by consolidating the \n     Edward Byrne Memorial Grant program and the Local Law \n     Enforcement Block Grant program, is one of the primary \n     federal assistance programs for state, tribal and local law \n     enforcement agencies. For more than a decade, the resources \n     provided under the JAG program have allowed law enforcement \n     agencies to expand their capabilities and make great strides \n     in reducing the incidence of crime in communities across the \n     nation. The JAG program provides crucial funding to assist \n     states, tribes and local governments in controlling and \n     preventing drug abuse, crime and violence, and in improving \n     the functioning of the criminal justice system.\n       However, this vital program has seen significant cuts in \n     recent years. H.R. 2862 as currently drafted in the Senate \n     would provide $625 million, a cut of $275 million or 30 \n     percent, from FY 2003 levels. Cuts of this magnitude will \n     certainly have a significant and negative impact on the \n     ability of state, tribal and local law enforcement agencies \n     to maintain the many critical anti-crime programs that are \n     currently supported by funds received under the JAG program.\n       It is vital that Congress act to ensure that state, tribal \n     and local law enforcement agencies continue to receive the \n     resources necessary to fulfill their mission of protecting \n     the public and the communities they serve. For these reasons, \n     the IACP urges all Members of Congress to support your \n     efforts to restore funding to the JAG program to FY 2003 \n     levels.\n       Thank you for your efforts on behalf of law enforcement.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Gene R. Voegtlin,\n     Legislative Counsel.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               Minnesota Sheriffs Association,\n\n                                                September 7, 2005.\n       Dear Senator Mark Dayton: The Sheriffs of Minnesota are \n     asking for your support and leadership in restoring funding \n     for the Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) program, including the \n     Byrne Grant Program and LLEBG. It is my understanding you are \n     considering an amendment that would add $275M to JAG which \n     would increase funding to 2003 level of funding.\n       Under the Administration's current proposal funding for \n     several of these crime fighting programs are significantly \n     decreased or eliminated altogether. The Minnesota Sheriffs \n     Association is requesting your support in restoring funding \n     for the Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant and COPS \n     programs. In Minnesota the Byrne Grant program is critical to \n     the success of our Gang and Drug Task Force operations. \n     During our Minnesota 2005 Legislative session, our \n     legislature appropriated local funds to match the Byrne Grant \n     funds. The coordination of these funds will give our law \n     enforcement officers the resources and necessary support as \n     they battle both increased gang activity and massive increase \n     in meth addiction and use within our state. Example: in a \n     recent sample survey at several of our county jails it was \n     revealed over 53% of our prisoners are in jail due to meth/\n     drug related charges. Without the Byrne Grant funding, local \n     crime fighting resources will have to be reduced.\n       Please do what you can to restore the Byrne Grant funding. \n     This is a very important source of federal funding for our \n     Sheriffs and local units of government. Thank you for your \n     consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                James D. Franklin,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              Minnesota Police and\n\n\n                                   Peace Officers Association,\n\n                                                September 8, 2005.\n     Hon. Senator Mark Dayton,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dayton: I write today to thank you and commend \n     your efforts to ensure continued and critically needed \n     funding for the Byrne Justice Assistance Program. I wish to \n     express the strong support of police officers across the \n     state and the 7,500 members of the Minnesota Police and Peace \n     Officers Association (MPPOA), for the Dayton-Chambliss \n     amendment to the FY 2006 Commerce, Justice, Science \n     Appropriations Bill (H.R. 2862) to enhance funds provided for \n     this critically important program.\n       In Minnesota and other states across the country, the Byrne \n     Justice Assistance Program is a significant source of support \n     for education, treatment, and law enforcement initiatives \n     combating the scourge of methamphetamine. As you know, \n     methamphetamine is a serious and still growing problem in \n     Minnesota, and it continues to spread throughout the nation. \n     Exposure to methamphetamme and the waste and by-products from \n     its production poses significant risks and has devastating \n     consequences--for individuals, children, communities, and \n     emergency services personnel. Indeed, nearly every day a \n     tragic story is reported in the Minnesota news media telling \n     of the devastating effect of methamphetamine on our \n     residents, our families, and our communities.\n       As President of Minnesota Police and Peace Officers \n     Association (MPPOA), I have witnessed first hand the benefits \n     of the Byrne Program in protecting our communities and \n     families from the growing problem of methamphetamine. In \n     Minnesota, the Byrne Justice Assistance Program funds\n\n[[Page S9786]]\n\n     local drug education treatment, and law enforcement programs, \n     including 21 multi-jurisdictional drug task forces that are \n     tasked with combating the epidemic of methamphetamine \n     trafficking and production in our communities. Without the \n     support of the Byrne Justice Assistance Program funding, \n     these drug task forces face reductions that will decrease \n     their abilities and effectiveness. Should this occur, \n     Minnesota's ability to fight the war on drugs would \n     undoubtedly be diminished, with potentially disastrous \n     consequences. I have attached a recent article from the \n     Fergus Falls (MN) Daily Herald which illustrates the \n     importance of the drug task forces and the potential \n     consequences of reductions in available resources.\n       The concerns of Minnesota law enforcement officers are not \n     limited to the borders of the state--methamphetamine \n     ``cooks'' often obtain the necessary ingredients in \n     surrounding states and manufacture the drug locally. In \n     addition, the international and interstate trafficking of \n     methamphetamine is increasing as the drug task forces succeed \n     in their efforts to identify, arrest, and prosecute domestic \n     clandestine methamphetamine laboratory operators. These \n     challenges exhibit the need for a strong federal response to \n     methamphetamine, an effort that, in many areas, depends on \n     the support of the Byrne Justice Assistance Grant Program.\n       Once again Senator Dayton, thank you for your continued \n     support of Minnesota's law enforcement community and your \n     efforts to ensure adequate resources in the national fight \n     against methamphetamine.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Bob Bushman,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senator Dayton and \nSenator Chambliss's amendment. In the wake of the devastation of \nHurricane Katrina and the massive displacement of hundreds of thousands \nof people, the country has once again relied on the strong efforts of \nthe Nation's first responders to provide aid during a time of national \ntragedy.\n  Although the Federal response to this disaster may have been too \nslow, there can be no doubt that the men and women on the nation's \nfront lines have valiantly come to the aid of their fellow citizens.\n  Police officers from New York City, NY, to Alton, IL, have answered \nthe call of duty and volunteered to go to New Orleans to assist in \nrescue, recovery, and reconstruction efforts. These brave men and women \nare the Nation's heroes, and this body should do all it can to provide \nthem with the resources they need to do their jobs.\n  Unfortunately, at a time when we are relying on the Nation's first \nresponders--our law enforcement, our fire fighters, our emergency \ntechnicians--to protect us against terrorism, to respond to natural \ndisasters, to protect us from the normal everyday ravages of crime and \ndrug use that do not abate just because the Nation is at war--it is \nshocking to me that Washington is contemplating major cuts to important \nlaw enforcement assistance programs.\n  That is why I am proud to be joining Senators Dayton and Chambliss in \ncosponsoring an amendment to the Commerce, Justice, Science \nappropriations bill to increase funding for the Edward Byrne Memorial \nJustice Assistance Grant Program.\n  The Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program, provides \nan important source of funding for state and local law enforcement to \nmake communities safer and improve criminal justice.\n  In Illinois, these dollars are put to good use. They help fight the \nscourge of methamphetamine, which has traveled from the West Coast to \nthe Midwest and is ruining rural communities across the country.\n  The meth problem has grown exponentially in the last few years. \nPolice in Illinois encountered 971 meth labs in 2003--more than double \nthe number seen in the year 2000. The quantity of meth seized by the \nIllinois State Police increased nearly ten-fold between 1997 and 2003.\n  The meth problem is taking over communities--depleting already \nlimited resources, taxing the police, the judicial system, social \nservices, and the schools. Every aspect of the local communities are \ntouched and harmed by meth.\n  Luckily, one program has proven helpful in Illinois' battle against \nmeth--the Byrne Justice Assistance Grant Program.\n  In 2004 alone, Byrne Justice Assistance Grant dollars helped make \n1,267 methamphetamine drug arrests in Illinois. That same year, Byrne \nJustice Assistance Grant dollars helped seize 348,923 grams of \nmethamphetamine.\n  For rural Illinois, Justice Assistance Grant dollars have provided a \nmuch-needed life raft, funding important multi-jurisdictional programs \nthat have allowed various counties and communities to join together, \ncombine resources and work to stop the onslaught of meth.\n  The Southern Illinois Enforcement Group--a coalition of three \nSouthern, predominantly rural Illinois counties, is one of these task \nforces. The unit has responded to 84 meth labs so far this year, more \nthan 40 percent of all meth labs in the greater Southern Illinois 33-\ncounty region for 2005.\n  When I visited with law enforcement from the Metropolitan Enforcement \nGroup of Southwestern Illinois, another one of these task forces, this \nAugust, they shared with me how important these dollars are to their \nefforts. They fear that any cuts will mean a reduction in the number of \nofficers, or even worse, the loss of the task force, either of which \nwill mean that they will have to battle a growing meth problem with \nfewer resources. Now, this body is proposing to flatfund the Byrne \nGrant Program at $625 million.\n  While this is much better than the alternative proposed by the \nPresident--who wanted to eliminate the program--and it is better than \nthe House option, which has voted to fund the Justice Assistance Grant \nProgram at $366.4 million--this is woefully short of the funding \nprovided this program only 3 years ago.\n  The amendment I cosponsor today would fund the Justice Assistance \nGrant program at $900 million, the same amount provided the Byrne \nFormula Grants and the Local Law Enforcement Block Grants, which \ncomprise the Justice Assistance Grant program in fiscal year 2003.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me and Senators Dayton and Chambliss \nin supporting our Nation's law enforcement--and giving them the \nresources they need to do their jobs.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be permitted to \nspeak for up to 10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            USA PATRIOT ACT\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, we are all very busily working on \nappropriations bills, and we are working in committees as individuals \nand leaders on the terrible tragedy of Hurricane Katrina, and our \nhearts and our thoughts and prayers go out to all the victims. We know \na tremendous amount of work needs to be done, and we are just beginning \nto see how big it is and how difficult it is going to be. Certainly, \nthe distinguished manager of the bill knows in his own State how \nterrible this crisis is.\n  But I believe it is important to issue a cautionary message that as \nwe approach the anniversary of 9/11, we cannot lose sight of the fact \nthat we are still at war and under attack by those who want to end our \nway of life and destroy our civilization and terrorize our citizens.\n  I have been asking myself: Are we safe from another terrorist attack \non the scale of 9/11? Is the Government doing everything it can to \nprotect us? What can we do better? We have heard recently some very \nominous warnings from leaders of al-Qaida that they are preparing \nanother terrorist attack. Obviously, we have to maintain the \nappropriate means of defense, and we\n\n[[Page S9787]]\n\nhave done a good job of making it more difficult for terrorists to \nstrike commercial airlines, but we also know, from having seen the \nattacks in London in July, that terrorists are looking for soft \ntargets.\n  It is not enough to protect what we know they have attacked in the \npast. We have to do a better job. I think President Bush was right in \nsaying the best way we can keep our country safe is to carry the war on \nterror to those countries that harbor terrorists.\n  I heard some discussion recently about whether we should have gone \ninto Iraq. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record an article by Christopher Hitchens in last week's Weekly \nStandard that lays out in detail, for anybody who is interested, why we \nhad to go into Iraq, why it is the right war. I would incorporate that \nby reference because that article does a good job of outlining my own \nbeliefs.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Weekly Standard, Sept. 5-12, 2005]\n\n      A War to Be Proud of: The Case for Overthrowing Saddam Was \n      Unimpeachable. Why, Then, Is the Administration Tongue-Tied?\n\n                       (By Christopher Hitchens)\n\n       Let me begin with a simple sentence that, even as I write \n     it, appears less than Swiftian in the modesty of its \n     proposal: ``Prison conditions at Abu Ghraib have improved \n     markedly and dramatically since the arrival of Coalition \n     troops in Baghdad.''\n       I could undertake to defend that statement against any \n     member of Human Rights Watch or Amnesty International, and I \n     know in advance that none of them could challenge it, let \n     alone negate it. Before March 2003, Abu Ghraib was an \n     abattoir, a torture chamber, and a concentration camp. Now, \n     and not without reason, it is an international byword for \n     Yankee imperialism and sadism. Yet the improvement is still, \n     unarguably, the difference between night and day. How is it \n     possible that the advocates of a post Saddam Iraq have been \n     placed on the defensive in this manner? And where should one \n     begin?\n       I once tried to calculate how long the post-Cold War \n     liberal Utopia had actually lasted. Whether you chose to date \n     its inception from the fall of the Berlin Wall in November \n     1989, or the death of Nicolae Ceausescu in late December of \n     the same year, or the release of Nelson Mandela from prison, \n     or the referendum defeat suffered by Augusto Pinochet (or \n     indeed from the publication of Francis Fukuyama's book about \n     the ``end of history'' and the unarguable triumph of market \n     liberal pluralism), it was an epoch that in retrospect was \n     over before it began. By the middle of 1990, Saddam Hussein \n     had abolished Kuwait and Slobodan Milosevic was attempting to \n     erase the identity and the existence of Bosnia. It turned out \n     that we had not by any means escaped the reach of atavistic, \n     aggressive, expansionist, and totalitarian ideology. Proving \n     the same point in another way, and within approximately the \n     same period, the theocratic dictator of Iran had publicly \n     claimed the right to offer money in his own name for the \n     suborning of the murder of a novelist living in London, and \n     the genocidaire faction in Rwanda had decided that it could \n     probably get away with putting its long-fantasized plan of \n     mass murder into operation.\n       One is not mentioning these apparently discrepant crimes \n     and nightmares as a random or unsorted list.\n       Khomeini, for example, was attempting to compensate for the \n     humiliation of the peace agreement he had been compelled to \n     sign with Saddam Hussein. And Saddam Hussein needed to make \n     up the loss, of prestige and income, that he had himself \n     suffered in the very same war. Milosevic (anticipating Putin, \n     as it now seems to me, and perhaps Beijing also) was riding a \n     mutation of socialist nationalism into national socialism. It \n     was to be noticed in all cases that the aggressors, whether \n     they were killing Muslims, or exalting Islam, or just killing \n     their neighbors, shared a deep and abiding hatred of the \n     United States.\n       The balance sheet of the Iraq war, if it is to be seriously \n     drawn up, must also involve a confrontation with at least \n     this much of recent history. Was the Bush administration \n     right to leave--actually to confirm--Saddam Hussein in power \n     after his eviction from Kuwait in 1991? Was James Baker \n     correct to say, in his delightfully folksy manner, that the \n     United States did not ``have a dog in the fight'' that \n     involved ethnic cleansing for the mad dream of a Greater \n     Serbia? Was the Clinton administration prudent in its retreat \n     from Somalia, or wise in its opposition to the U.N. \n     resolution that called for a preemptive strengthening of the \n     U.N. forces in Rwanda?\n       I know hardly anybody who comes out of this examination \n     with complete credit. There were neoconservatives who jeered \n     at Rushdie in 1989 and who couldn't see the point when \n     Sarajevo faced obliteration in 1992. There were leftist \n     humanitarians and radicals who rallied to Rushdie and called \n     for solidarity with Bosnia, but who--perhaps because of a bad \n     conscience about Palestine--couldn't face a confrontation \n     with Saddam Hussein even when he annexed a neighbor state \n     that was a full member of the Arab League and of the U.N. (I \n     suppose I have to admit that I was for a time a member of \n     that second group.) But there were consistencies, too. French \n     statecraft, for example, was uniformly hostile to any \n     resistance to any aggression, and Paris even sent troops to \n     rescue its filthy clientele in Rwanda. And some on the hard \n     left and the brute right were also opposed to any exercise, \n     for any reason, of American military force.\n       The only speech by any statesman that can bear reprinting \n     from that low, dishonest decade came from Tony Blair when he \n     spoke in Chicago in 1999. Welcoming the defeat and overthrow \n     of Milosevic after the Kosovo intervention, he warned against \n     any self-satisfaction and drew attention to an inescapable \n     confrontation that was coming with Saddam Hussein. So far \n     from being an American ``poodle,'' as his taunting and \n     ignorant foes like to sneer, Blair had in fact leaned on \n     Clinton over Kosovo and was insisting on the importance of \n     Iraq while George Bush was still an isolationist governor of \n     Texas.\n       Notwithstanding this prescience and principle on his part, \n     one still cannot read the journals of the 2000/2001 \n     millennium without the feeling that one is revisiting a \n     hopelessly somnambulist relative in a neglected home. I am \n     one of those who believe, uncynically, that Osama bin Laden \n     did us all a service (and holy war a great disservice) by his \n     mad decision to assault the American homeland four years ago. \n     Had he not made this world-historical mistake, we would have \n     been able to add a Talibanized and nuclear-armed Pakistan to \n     our list of the threats we failed to recognize in time. (This \n     threat still exists, but it is no longer so casually \n     overlooked.)\n       The subsequent liberation of Pakistan's theocratic colony \n     in Afghanistan, and the so-far decisive eviction and defeat \n     of its bin Ladenist guests, was only a reprisal. It took care \n     of the last attack. But what about the next one? For anyone \n     with eyes to see, there was only one other state that \n     combined the latent and the blatant definitions of both \n     ``rogue'' and ``failed.'' This state--Saddam's ruined and \n     tortured and collapsing Iraq--had also met all the conditions \n     under which a country may be deemed to have sacrificed its \n     own legal sovereignty. To recapitulate: It had invaded its \n     neighbors, committed genocide on its own soil, harbored and \n     nurtured international thugs and killers, and flouted \n     every provision of the Non-Proliferation Treaty. The \n     United Nations, in this crisis, faced with regular insult \n     to its own resolutions and its own character, had managed \n     to set up a system of sanctions-based mutual corruption. \n     In May 2003, had things gone on as they had been going, \n     Saddam Hussein would have been due to fill Iraq's slot as \n     chair of the U.N. Conference on Disarmament. Meanwhile, \n     every species of gangster from the hero of the Achille \n     Lauro hijacking to Abu Musab al Zarqawi was finding \n     hospitality under Saddam's crumbling roof.\n       One might have thought, therefore, that Bush and Blair's \n     decision to put an end at last to this intolerable state of \n     affairs would be hailed, not just as a belated vindication of \n     long-ignored U.N. resolutions but as some corrective to the \n     decade of shame and inaction that had just passed in Bosnia \n     and Rwanda. But such is not the case. An apparent consensus \n     exists, among millions of people in Europe and America, that \n     the whole operation for the demilitarization of Iraq, and the \n     salvage of its traumatized society, was at best a false \n     pretense and at worst an unprovoked aggression. How can this \n     possibly be?\n       There is, first, the problem of humorless and pseudo-\n     legalistic literalism. In Saki's short story The Lumber Room, \n     the naughty but clever child Nicholas, who has actually \n     placed a frog in his morning bread-and-milk, rejoices in his \n     triumph over the adults who don't credit this excuse for not \n     eating his healthful dish:\n       ``You said there couldn't possibly be a frog in my bread-\n     and-milk; there was a frog in my bread-and-milk,'' he \n     repeated, with the insistence of a skilled tactician who does \n     not intend to shift from favorable ground.\n       Childishness is one thing--those of us who grew up on this \n     wonderful Edwardian author were always happy to see the \n     grown-ups and governesses discomfited. But puerility in \n     adults is quite another thing, and considerably less \n     charming. ``You said there were WMDs in Iraq and that Saddam \n     had friends in al Qaeda. . . . Blah, blah, pants on fire.'' I \n     have had many opportunities to tire of this mantra. It takes \n     ten seconds to intone the said mantra. It would take me, on \n     my most eloquent C-SPAN day, at the very least five minutes \n     to say that Abdul Rahman Yasin, who mixed the chemicals for \n     the World Trade Center attack in 1993, subsequently sought \n     and found refuge in Baghdad; that Dr. Mahdi Obeidi, Saddam's \n     senior physicist, was able to lead American soldiers to \n     nuclear centrifuge parts and a blueprint for a complete \n     centrifuge (the crown jewel of nuclear physics) buried on the \n     orders of Qusay Hussein; that Saddam's agents were in \n     Damascus as late as February 2003, negotiating to purchase \n     missiles off the shelf from North Korea; or that Rolf Ekeus, \n     the great Swedish socialist who founded the inspection \n     process in Iraq after 1991, has told me for the record that \n     he was offered a $2 million bribe in a face-to face meeting \n     with Tariq Aziz. And these eye-catching examples would by no \n     means exhaust my repertoire, or empty my quiver. Yes, it must \n     be admitted that Bush and Blair made a hash of a good case, \n     largely because they preferred to scare people rather\n\n[[Page S9788]]\n\n     than enlighten them or reason with them. Still, the only real \n     strategy of deception has come from those who believe, or \n     pretend, that Saddam Hussein was no problem.\n       I have a ready answer to those who accuse me of being an \n     agent and tool of the Bush-Cheney administration (which is \n     the nicest thing that my enemies can find to say). Attempting \n     a little levity, I respond that I could stay at home if the \n     authorities could bother to make their own case, but that I \n     meanwhile am a prisoner of what I actually do know about the \n     permanent hell, and the permanent threat, of the Saddam \n     regime. However, having debated almost all of the \n     spokespeople for the antiwar faction, both the sane and the \n     deranged, I was recently asked a question that I was \n     temporarily unable to answer. ``If what you claim is true,'' \n     the honest citizen at this meeting politely asked me, \n     ``how come the White House hasn't told us?''\n       I do in fact know the answer to this question. So deep and \n     bitter is the split within official Washington, most \n     especially between the Defense Department and the CIA, that \n     any claim made by the former has been undermined by leaks \n     from the latter. (The latter being those who maintained, with \n     a combination of dogmatism and cowardice not seen since \n     Lincoln had to fire General McClellan, that Saddam Hussein \n     was both a ``secular'' actor and--this is the really rich \n     bit--a rational and calculating one.)\n       There's no cure for that illusion, but the resulting \n     bureaucratic chaos and unease has cornered the president into \n     his current fallback upon platitude and hollowness. It has \n     also induced him to give hostages to fortune. The claim that \n     if we fight fundamentalism ``over there'' we won't have to \n     confront it ``over here'' is not just a standing invitation \n     for disproof by the next suicide-maniac in London or Chicago, \n     but a coded appeal to provincial and isolationist opinion in \n     the United States. Surely the elementary lesson of the grim \n     anniversary that will shortly be upon us is that American \n     civilians are as near to the front line as American soldiers.\n       It is exactly this point that makes nonsense of the sob-\n     sister tripe pumped out by the Cindy Sheehan circus and its \n     surrogates. But in reply, why bother to call a struggle \n     ``global'' if you then try to localize it? Just say plainly \n     that we shall fight them everywhere they show themselves, and \n     fight them on principle as well as in practice, and get ready \n     to warn people that Nigeria is very probably the next target \n     of the jihadists. The peaceniks love to ask: When and where \n     will it all end? The answer is easy: It will end with the \n     surrender or defeat of one of the contending parties. Should \n     I add that I am certain which party that ought to be? Defeat \n     is just about imaginable, though the mathematics and the \n     algebra tell heavily against the holy warriors. Surrender to \n     such a foe, after only four years of combat, is not even \n     worthy of consideration.\n       Antaeus was able to draw strength from the earth every time \n     an antagonist wrestled him to the ground. A reverse mythology \n     has been permitted to take hold in the present case, where \n     bad news is deemed to be bad news only for regime-change. \n     Anyone with the smallest knowledge of Iraq knows that its \n     society and infrastructure and institutions have been \n     appallingly maimed and beggared by three decades of war and \n     fascism (and the ``divide-and-rule'' tactics by which Saddam \n     maintained his own tribal minority of the Sunni minority in \n     power). In logic and morality, one must therefore compare the \n     current state of the country with the likely or probable \n     state of it had Saddam and his sons been allowed to go on \n     ruling.\n       At once, one sees that all the alternatives would have been \n     infinitely worse, and would most likely have led to an \n     implosion--as well as opportunistic invasions from Iran and \n     Turkey and Saudi Arabia, on behalf of their respective \n     interests or confessional clienteles. This would in turn have \n     necessitated a more costly and bloody intervention by some \n     kind of coalition, much too late and on even worse terms and \n     conditions. This is the lesson of Bosnia and Rwanda \n     yesterday, and of Darfur today. When I have made this point \n     in public, I have never had anyone offer an answer to it. A \n     broken Iraq was in our future no matter what, and was a \n     responsibility (somewhat conditioned by our past blunders) \n     that no decent person could shirk. The only unthinkable \n     policy was one of abstention.\n       Two pieces of good fortune still attend those of us who go \n     out on the road for this urgent and worthy cause. The first \n     is contingent: There are an astounding number of plain frauds \n     and charlatans (to phrase it at is highest) in charge of the \n     propaganda of the other side. Just to tell off the names is \n     to frighten children more than Saki ever could: Michael \n     Moore, George Galloway, Jacques Chirac, Tim Robbins, Richard \n     Clarke, Joseph Wilson . . . a roster of gargoyles that \n     would send Ripley himself into early retirement. Some of \n     these characters are flippant, and make heavy jokes about \n     Halliburton, and some disdain to conceal their sympathy \n     for the opposite side. So that's easy enough.\n       The second bit of luck is a certain fiber displayed by a \n     huge number of anonymous Americans. Faced with a constant \n     drizzle of bad news and purposely demoralizing commentary, \n     millions of people stick out their jaws and hang tight. I am \n     no fan of populism, but I surmise that these citizens are \n     clear on the main point: It is out of the question--plainly \n     and absolutely out of the question--that we should surrender \n     the keystone state of the Middle East to a rotten, murderous \n     alliance between Baathists and bin Ladenists. When they hear \n     the fatuous insinuation that this alliance has only been \n     created by the resistance to it, voters know in their \n     intestines that those who say so are soft on crime and soft \n     on fascism. The more temperate anti-warriors, such as Mark \n     Danner and Harold Meyerson, like to employ the term ``a war \n     of choice.'' One should have no problem in accepting this \n     concept. As they cannot and do not deny, there was going to \n     be another round with Saddam Hussein no matter what. To whom, \n     then, should the ``choice'' of time and place have fallen? \n     The clear implication of the antichoice faction--if I may so \n     dub them--is that this decision should have been left up to \n     Saddam Hussein. As so often before.\n       Does the President deserve the benefit of the reserve of \n     fortitude that I just mentioned? Only just, if at all. We \n     need not argue about the failures and the mistakes and even \n     the crimes, because these in some ways argue themselves. But \n     a positive accounting could be offered without braggartry, \n     and would include:\n       (1) The overthrow of Talibanism and Baathism, and the \n     exposure of many highly suggestive links between the two \n     elements of this Hitler-Stalin pact. Abu Musab al Zarqawi, \n     who moved from Afghanistan to Iraq before the coalition \n     intervention, has even gone to the trouble of naming his \n     organization al Qaeda in Mesopotamia.\n       (2) The subsequent capitulation of Qaddafi's Libya in point \n     of weapons of mass destruction--a capitulation that was \n     offered not to Kofi Annan or the E.U. but to Blair and Bush.\n       (3) The consequent unmasking of the A.Q. Khan network for \n     the illicit transfer of nuclear technology to Libya, Iran, \n     and North Korea.\n       (4) The agreement by the United Nations that its own reform \n     is necessary and overdue, and the unmasking of a quasi-\n     criminal network within its elite.\n       (5) The craven admission by President Chirac and Chancellor \n     Schroder, when confronted with irrefutable evidence of \n     cheating and concealment, respecting solemn treaties, on the \n     part of Iran, that not even this will alter their commitment \n     to neutralism. (One had already suspected as much in the \n     Iraqi case. )\n       (6) The ability to certify Iraq as actually disarmed, \n     rather than accept the word of a psychopathic autocrat.\n       (7) The immense gains made by the largest stateless \n     minority in the region--the Kurds--and the spread of this \n     example to other states.\n       (8) The related encouragement of democratic and civil \n     society movements in Egypt, Syria, and most notably Lebanon, \n     which has regained a version of its autonomy.\n       (9) The violent and ignominious death of thousands of bin \n     Ladenist infiltrators into Iraq and Afghanistan, and the real \n     prospect of greatly enlarging this number.\n       (10) The training and hardening of many thousands of \n     American servicemen and women in a battle against the forces \n     of nihilism and absolutism, which training and hardening will \n     surely be of great use in future combat.\n       It would be admirable if the president could manage to make \n     such a presentation. It would also be welcome if he and his \n     deputies adopted a clear attitude toward the war within the \n     war: in other words, stated plainly, that the secular and \n     pluralist forces within Afghan and Iraqi society, while they \n     are not our clients, can in no circumstance be allowed to \n     wonder which outcome we favor.\n       The great point about Blair's 1999 speech was that it \n     asserted the obvious. Coexistence with aggressive regimes or \n     expansionist, theocratic, and totalitarian ideologies is not \n     in fact possible. One should welcome this conclusion for the \n     additional reason that such coexistence is not desirable, \n     either. If the great effort to remake Iraq as a demilitarized \n     federal and secular democracy should fail or be defeated, I \n     shall lose sleep for the rest of my life in reproaching \n     myself for doing too little. But at least I shall have the \n     comfort of not having offered, so far as I can recall, any \n     word or deed that contributed to a defeat.\n\n  Mr. BOND. But more important, we cannot just play defense against the \nterrorists. We have to collect more and better information. We have to \nget information on the location and activities of the next attack that \nis being planned. Unless we do a good job of that, we cannot have a \ngood chance of stopping the next major terrorist attack on the United \nStates.\n  I believe one part of that vital solution is found in a robust USA \nPATRIOT Act that would continue to provide national security \ninvestigators with the tools needed to continue to keep our country \nsafe.\n  The PATRIOT Act has been the subject of national controversy and has \nundergone many unsubstantiated attacks by its opponents. But the fact \nis that the PATRIOT Act saved lives, and its original content must be \npreserved. We need to continue to focus on making sure we have the \nintelligence and the investigative resources necessary to protect \nagainst further attacks. We not only need to make permanent the \nprovisions that are already in law, but we also must modify the current \nHouse\n\n[[Page S9789]]\n\nversion to include expanded authorities needed by national security \ninvestigators.\n  The men and women who are fighting the war on terror every day here \nat home say that without the PATRIOT Act, many of our Nation's most \nimportant successes would not have been possible. It addressed critical \nvulnerabilities in the pre-9/11 homeland defense posture. For example, \nit allowed national security investigators, pending a court's approval, \nto obtain and use a multiple wiretap to track a suspect's phone \ncommunications, even when a terrorist switches, changes, or abandons \nphones to avoid detection, a common terrorist tactic.\n  Specifically, according to senior law enforcement officials, during \nthe summer of 2002, the act allowed our Nation's law enforcement \nintelligence communities to break up the Portland Seven terrorist cell. \nMembers of that cell had traveled to Afghanistan in 2001 and 2002 to \njoin the Taliban and al-Qaida against the United States.\n  In 2004, the act was used to protect the El Paso Islamic Center. When \nJared Bjarnason sent an e-mail threatening to burn the center to the \nground if hostages in Iraq were not freed, the FBI used provisions of \nthe PATRIOT Act to identify him as the source of the threat. Without \nthe provisions in that act, it would have taken 30 days to obtain a \nstring of needed search warrants, while the threat of attack was only 3 \ndays away.\n  Why is it that we need to make permanent several of the acts's \nprovisions? Why do we need to modify proposed legislation to enhance \nfurther the ability of our Nation's law enforcement authorities? Some \nmay argue: If it ain't broke, then don't fix it. But I am a show-me \nMissourian, and I can tell you that making permanent these provisions \nis very important.\n  Terrorism is the operative challenge we face. Over the last 4 years \nsince 9/11, we have seen terrorism and specifically violent Sunni \nextremists waging war against us and our allies, led and inspired by \nOsama bin Laden and his lieutenant Ayman Al-Zawahiri. They are not a \nstatic, monolithic, or predictable enemy. They do not have a country. \nThey are not identifiable as a nation or a state. They are a \ncombination of stateless hierarchical and formalistic structures, \nequally lethal and fragmented. Because of the traits in the cultural \nand religious complexities, they are not predictable, quantifiable, or \nvulnerable to penetration. We have seen this in the Intelligence \nCommittee, and we know that there is a great danger out there that we \nmust continue to work to avoid.\n  These groups are highly organized and disciplined. They are inspired \nby bin Laden and Ayman Al-Zawahiri. They have been led, trained, and \nfunded by graduates of al-Qaida training centers. Our enemy is \ndetermined to win. It is committed to victory. We cannot afford just to \nbe hopeful.\n  As CIA Director James Woolsey once said: It is as if we were fighting \nwith the dragon for some 45 years, slew the dragon, and then found \nourselves in a jungle of poisonous snakes. The snakes are a lot harder \nto keep track of than the dragon ever was.\n  The PATRIOT Act is designed to be preventive. We know that the \nterrorists want to bleed us. Unfortunately, we have seen the blasphemy \nof Osama bin Laden taking the God of Abraham and claiming:\n\n       Allah willing, and nothing is too great for Allah.\n\n  This videotape was just released. And more recently his deputy, Ayman \nAl-Zawahiri, released a message saying:\n\n       The land and interests of the countries which took part in \n     the aggression against Palestine, Iraq, and Afghanistan are \n     targets for us. If you continue your politics against \n     Muslims, you will see, God willing, such horror that you will \n     forget the horrors of Vietnam.\n\n  This is the same kind of challenge and the same kind of threat we saw \nbefore 9/11. This, I am saying, requires us to be even more attuned and \nprepared for a potential terrorist attack.\n  I also note that in the recent BRAC proposals, we have gotten rid of \nmany of the Air National Guard's air national defense missions. On 9/\n11, the Air National Guard flew 90 percent of the first 400 combat air \npatrols after the first 24 hours of the attack. We need to rethink our \ndismemberment of those critical assets.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their indulgence. We are \nstill facing a danger that we cannot overlook as we deal with the very \nreal and certain tragedies of Katrina. I hope we will be able to \ncontinue our efforts to make sure that our law enforcement and \nintelligence agencies have the kind of resources they need to root out, \nto ferret out, to discover and, we hope, to defend against future \nterrorist attacks.\n  I thank the Chair and my colleagues, the managers of the bill. I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican whip.\n\n\n                  Senate Response to Hurricane Katrina\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, in times of catastrophe, when \ndestruction, suffering, and death are so overwhelming that it breaks \nyour heart and almost leaves you numb, it is comforting to find that an \noutpouring of generosity, kindness, and help from our fellow man \nrestores our faith and strengthens our souls.\n  With all the destruction wrought by Hurricane Katrina, we see more \nand more acts of extraordinary generosity and kindness. In Louisville, \nKentucky, my hometown, we are preparing right now to receive over 500 \nevacuees who have lost their homes due to Katrina. With all their \nworldly possessions gone, they are reliant on the kindness and \ngenerosity of their fellow Americans, and we are finding all across the \ncountry that kindness and generosity is certainly not lacking.\n  Red Cross volunteers in Louisville are working around the clock to \nturn the city's fairgrounds into a temporary shelter. At home, over 300 \nfamilies turned out to shower donations on a local Salvation Army \ncenter. One man alone brought over 6,000 diapers. Others are bringing \nbasic necessities such as soap, toothpaste, and towels.\n  This spirit of generosity for our fellow man is by no means limited \nto the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Across America, we have all seen \npictures or heard stories over the last several days of millions of \ntotal strangers reaching out to help their fellow citizens who have \nbeen displaced by the tragic events on the Gulf Coast. We see Girl \nScouts filling old backpacks with clothes, blankets and, yes, a stuffed \nanimal for children who have lost everything. We hear of Boy Scouts \ncollecting food and clothes, as well as raising funds for the Red \nCross, the Salvation Army, and other aid organizations. Businesses \nsmall and large have opened their hearts, wallets, and warehouses to \nprovide cash as well as in-kind aid. Churches of all denominations have \ntaken up the cause of their brother's keeper.\n  Thanks to the support of so many Americans, the thousands of people \nfrom Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama affected by Katrina will have \na chance to build new lives. Of course, local, State, and Federal \nGovernment has the major role to play at this point. I am pleased we \nwere able to act quickly last week and pass a $10.5 billion \nappropriation for emergency response and recovery efforts. We are going \nto pass later today, hopefully, another $51.8 billion in assistance, \nand more will be on the way if and when that is needed.\n  Our thoughts and prayers are with our fellow Americans who have \ntragically lost loved ones and with many others who have lost their \nhomes and all of their worldly possessions. The Senate must focus on \nthe immediate task before us of providing support for the relief, \nrecovery, and rebuilding of the Gulf Coast region.\n  While we have much important work to do in the days and weeks ahead, \nwe can take some comfort that, once again, in the midst of a tragedy, \nthe worst of times seems to bring out the best in our people. So let us \nappreciate the people of Louisville, of Atlanta, Houston, Baton Rouge, \nand all over the country who are reaching out to help Katrina's victims \nall across the Gulf States. While one person alone may make little \ndifference in comparison to the magnitude of this disaster, millions of \nindividual acts of compassion taking place all over our country will go \na long way to alleviate the suffering.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, are we still in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is considering the appropriations \nbill for Commerce-Justice-Science.\n\n[[Page S9790]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 1661\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendments be laid aside so that I may send an amendment to the desk \nand ask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Biden] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1661.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To provide emergency funding for victims of Hurricane \n                                Katrina)\n\n       At the end of the bill, insert the following:\n\n      TITLE VII--EMERGENCY RELIEF FOR VICTIMS OF HURRICANE KATRINA\n\n       In addition to amounts otherwise provided for in this Act, \n     the following amounts are appropriated for fiscal year 2006 \n     and designated as an emergency requirement pursuant to \n     section 402 of H. Con. Res. 95 (109th Congress):\n       (1) Enhancing state and local law enforcement.--\n     $1,000,000,000 to the Community Oriented Policing Services \n     function in the following amounts:\n       (A) $700,000,000 added to the Hiring section.\n       (B) $300,000,000 to the Interoperable Communications \n     Technology section.\n       (2) Assisting children impacted by hurricane katrina.--\n     Under the Missing Children Program, $10,000,000 to the \n     National Center for Missing and Exploited Children to find, \n     unite, and transport children impacted by Hurricane Katrina \n     to their parents, legal guardian, or next of kin.\n       (3) Assisting victims of sexual abuse and domestic \n     violence.--Under the Violence Against Women Act function, \n     $8,000,000 for the Office of Violence Against Women to assist \n     victims of domestic violence and sexual abuse in the areas \n     impacted by Hurricane Katrina in the following amounts:\n       (A) $2,000,000 for the Rape Abuse and Incest National \n     Network (RAINN) to rebuild crises centers, provide emergency \n     counseling services in shelters, provide emergency counseling \n     services in shelters, provide adequate services in \n     communities with evacuees, and provide adequate short- and \n     long-term support for displaced persons across the country.\n       (B) $1,000,000 for nonprofit, nongovernmental statewide \n     coalitions serving sexual assault victims within the State to \n     be used to assist victims of sexual assault affected by \n     Hurricane Katrina as determined by the assessment of \n     statewide coalitions.\n       (C) $6,000,000 to be allocated, in consultation with the \n     Department of Health and Human Services, to nonprofit, \n     nongovernmental statewide domestic violence coalitions \n     serving domestic violence programs within the State to be \n     used to assist victims of domestic violence affected by \n     Hurricane Katrina as determined by the assessment of the \n     statewide coalitions, and that the statewide coalitions can \n     assess those needs.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I have a number of points to make today. \nThe bottom line of what I am proposing is an amendment to the Commerce-\nJustice-Science appropriations bill relating to law enforcement and \nCOPS. The bottom line is--and I will explain this briefly--No. 1, I \npropose adding $1.019 billion to assist local law enforcement, support \nvictims of domestic violence and sexual assault, and deal with some \naspects of the impact of the hurricane on local law enforcement.\n  No. 2, this amendment contains $1 billion for the Office of Community \nOriented Policing Services, the so-called COPS Program. It provides \n$700 million for hiring local officers, and it provides $300 million \nfor interoperable communications equipment for local agencies. If you \never need any evidence of the fact that we need that equipment and need \nmore of it, I think Katrina has demonstrated that, unfortunately, \nfairly well.\n  It also contains $10 million for the National Center for Missing and \nExploited Children to help find and reunite children displaced by \nHurricane Katrina, and it has $9 million to support victims of domestic \nviolence and sexual assault impacted by what happened during this \ncrisis.\n  It sounds like a lot of money--and it is a lot of money--but we have \nmade a serious mistake relating to our domestic security, our homeland \nsecurity, and our need to deal with the looming threats that flow from \nnot only national disasters we are facing now--and I hope we don't face \nanother like this--but the terrors spoken about by my friend from \nMissouri.\n  In 2002, we were aiding local law enforcement collectively by $2.4 \nbillion a year. Although there has been some correction made, this \nadministration proposed cutting that direct aid to local law \nenforcement down to $168 million. I find that mind-boggling. I find \nthat as misplaced and misunderstood a representation as I do cutting \nmoney for levees and cutting money for the Corps of Engineers, as we \nhave done the last 4 years. This is an attempt to not restore all but \nrestore part of the assistance we provided for local law enforcement in \nthe past.\n  The devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina has revealed the best and \nthe worst about our great Nation. It has revealed a great economic \ndivide that exists among our citizens, while it demonstrated as well \nthe capacity of the majority of our citizens to be compassionate and \neven heroic during times of great need. It also exposed the demons of \nsome who will use any opportunity to prey on the weak.\n  The hurricane also demonstrated the best and the worst in our \nGovernment. It is clear by all accounts that the Federal response was \ninsufficient, and we will be discussing that in the coming days, weeks, \nand months to hopefully address the concerns so that, God forbid, faced \nwith this or an attack, we would not go through the same degree of \nincompetence that seems to have been spread across the governmental \nfront.\n  It also demonstrates clearly to me we have to do more to support \nState and local law enforcement officials. These men and women, in my \nopinion, demonstrated the best the Government had to offer, as opposed \nto the sudden incompetence we have seen. The men and women in Biloxi, \nNew Orleans, and other police departments in the region have been \nworking 24 hours a day. Many of them have lost their homes, and their \nfamilies have been displaced. They have been working with limited food \nand water.\n  Many of them do not even have the facilities to take a shower and use \na restroom. Lieutenant Bennelli of the New Orleans Police Department \nstated:\n\n       I spent a year in Vietnam. The ordeal that these officials \n     have gone through has been as trying as the time I spent in \n     Vietnam.\n\n  For everyone who argues that--and I hear this a lot around here these \ndays--local law enforcement is a local problem, they should take a look \nat what is happening in the Gulf States. I know many of my colleagues--\nand I respect my colleagues who have this view, but they are into this \ndevolution of Government stuff, the new paradigm they like to talk \nabout. They talk about the new paradigm in foreign policy. They talk \nabout a new paradigm in local law enforcement in terms of devolution of \nGovernment. Translated, that means the only thing the Federal \nGovernment should do is those things which no State can do. Or put \nanother way, if the State can do any of what is required to meet the \nneeds of their citizens, only the State should do it.\n  From men and women on this floor who are equally as adamant about \nfighting crime as I have been in my years, they are saying they support \neliminating the COPS Program. Why? They say it is not the business of \nthe Federal Government. The Federal Government should not be involved \nin local law enforcement.\n  Well, I like to point out that 60 percent of all the crimes committed \nin America relate to drugs, abuse of drugs, the sale of drugs, illicit \ndrugs. Is that a State responsibility or does not that stuff come \nacross the border? Does not that stuff come from the Andes? Does not \nthat stuff come from Afghanistan? Does not that stuff come from abroad? \nWe can have the best police department, the most significant--and I \nthink we have the best law enforcement agencies in the Nation in the \nState of Delaware, and you cannot stop the drugs coming down from \nAramingo Avenue in Philadelphia. They cross State lines. So I \nrespectfully suggest to the devolution-of-Government guys that Federal \nresponsibility exists as it relates to local crime and local law \nenforcement.\n  I would like to point out another thing. God forbid we have an \nattack. Let us assume--and it was not, but let us assume some divers \nwere planting explosives to blow up the levees along the Mississippi as \nopposed to Lake Pontchartrain, which by the way is a lot higher. Who is \ngoing to find them? Is it going to be some brave special\n\n[[Page S9791]]\n\nforces officer in night vision goggles watching this happen and they \nare going to capture them or is it going to be my son who is now in the \nNational Guard down in Gulfport, MS, patrolling the streets? Is he the \none going to be doing that? No, it is going to be a local cop.\n  Who is going to find the guy or the woman or the terrorist who is \ngoing to try to put sarin gas into the Houston Astrodome or a giant \nshopping mall? It is going to be some cop coming from Dunkin' Donuts \nriding behind the facility catching someone in a dumpster.\n  I do not know what we are thinking about here. Cutting local law \nenforcement moneys? Forget Katrina, which only makes the point more \nstarkly, but forget it for a moment. What are we doing? We had a great \nPresident named Reagan who said, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.\n  Guess what. Nobody has argued the COPS Program has not succeeded. No \none has argued it has failed. A former Attorney General said, when it \nwas time to eliminate it, I think the word he used was miraculous, it \nhas been a miraculous program.\n  Let us cut it? Let us eliminate it?\n  I would make the suggestion that law enforcement is not purely a \nlocal problem. Look at what is happening in the Gulf States right now. \nLaw enforcement is a national concern and requires a national response \nand a national commitment. Local communities need robust police \ndepartments. They need superior communication technology and equipment. \nI know my friends in the Commerce Committee know more about the \nspectrum fight, which I will not get into now, than most do, but the \nidea that there is not sufficient spectrum available to our first \nresponders because the broadcast industry is unwilling to commit to the \ndeal they made is beyond me.\n  Local communities are the ones that not only affect the overall \nsecurity of the country but the day-to-day lives of their citizens by \nreducing crime. This also helps local governments be better at \nresponding in periods of crisis. What could be more important to the \nnational priority than the safety of our citizens?\n  We simply have not been doing right by our States and local \ngovernment partners over the past few years. Throughout the 1990s we \nallocated billions of dollars to hire local law enforcement, provided \nthem with the technology they needed. We all know the story. Reduce \ncrime each year for 8 consecutive years and we are still reaping the \nbenefits of those successes as crime rates still go down.\n  I would like to point out one other simple fact. Having chaired the \nJudiciary Committee or been its ranking member for I think 17 years and \nbeing on that committee for 30 years, to the best of my knowledge, \nthere is no other time in American history when the cadre of those in \ntheir crime-committing years, meaning young people between the ages of \n14 and 25, have increased and violent crime has gone down. This program \nhas worked because the States have made it work. We reduced crime, as I \nsaid, 8 years in a row. But we did more than reduce crime by this \nlegislation we have cut so drastically. We also demonstrated a \ncommitment to local agencies. We increased their capacity to respond to \nany situations of the local communities.\n  In this year's budget, we have allocated only $2 million to hire \npolice officers. This amount will hire approximately 25 officers \nthroughout the Nation, hardly a ringing endorsement of our local \nagencies. Right now, the COPS office has pending applications to hire \n8,000 local officers left unfilled due to lack of funds. The amendment \nI am offering today would provide $700 million to immediately fill \nthese needs with special emphasis on filling the needs of those \nagencies in the devastated regions. The New Orleans Police Department \nin particular will need special assistance. If this funding is \nallocated to the COPS office, it should work with those agencies first.\n  We also know that network capabilities of agencies in the area have \nbeen destroyed. We need to help them get those networks back on line so \nthey can continue to do their job. My amendment would add $300 million \nto the current allocation of $37 million, which is all that has \nbeen allocated. It would add $300 million to help agencies in the gulf \ncoast get up and running again. The COPS office has had an overtime \nprogram to help local agencies pay overtime. We all understand the need \nto assist local agencies that have been working around the clock, but \nbased on conversations with the Louisiana Association of Chiefs of \nPolice and the National Sheriffs Association, it is my understanding \nthat the Federal Emergency Management Agency will be reimbursing local \nagencies for those costs. Because of this understanding, we have not \nincluded additional assistance for overtime in this amendment.\n\n  Finally, we include $19 million for children who have been displaced \nand to support the domestic violence shelters that have been destroyed. \nThe National Center for Missing and Exploited Children has reported \nthat over 1,000 children have been displaced by this storm--that means \nthey are not with their parents or guardians--and in this amendment we \nprovide $10 million for that effort.\n  We also provide $9 million to support domestic violence victims \nimpacted by the storms. We all heard of the reports of sexual assaults \nin the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, and we will support those \nvictims who have not been moved to new shelters.\n  In addition, this funding will support the shelters in Louisiana, \nMississippi, and Alabama that have been impacted and will help support \nshelters in adjoining States that have been called upon to do much more \nin the coming months.\n  I think all of my colleagues have heard me say that I believe there \nis not a more important responsibility in Government than the safety of \nits citizens. It comes before their health, before their education, \nbefore everything. There are no civil liberties, there are no \nopportunities if one is not able to be safe on the street. Without \nsafety and security, nothing else matters. Our local law enforcement \nagencies are there every day fighting crime and responding to \nemergencies. Hurricane Katrina demonstrated quite starkly the way we \nrely on them. The Federal support for these officers has been on a \nsteady decline, as I said at the outset, the past few years. We need to \nreverse that trend. This amendment will help us get back on track.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join the leadership of \nSenator Reid and Senator Landrieu who have announced a package of \nproposals to be of assistance to the Hurricane Katrina victims so that \nthe millions of people affected by the devastation along the gulf coast \ncan begin to rebuild their lives.\n  The amendment which I have sent to the desk is only part of that \nbroader proposal and deals with the housing situation which now \nconfronts the victims of this tragic storm. Before going into the \ndetails of the proposal, I want to extend my deepest sympathies to \nthose in Louisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi who have lost loved ones \nor who are still searching for family members, neighbors, and friends. \nThey need to know that the thoughts and prayers of the country are with \nthem during these very difficult and trying times. We know that \nhundreds and hundreds of thousands of Americans have lost their houses, \ntheir jobs, their belongings, indeed, their communities.\n  An effort is now underway in the Congress to come to their \nassistance. We know the road to recovery will not be easy and it will \nnot be short, but we need to undertake these efforts immediately.\n  It was earlier estimated this week by FEMA officials and told to the \nPresident that 500,000 to a million people were rendered homeless by \nHurricane Katrina and the deadly floods that followed the hurricane. In \nfact, yesterday's New York Times reported that as many as a million \npeople are without housing. While the first job was to evacuate people, \nto get them food and water and to address their medical needs, in other \nwords, to in effect save the lives of those who have been so heavily \nimpacted, I think it is fair to say that the next job confronting us \nwould be to find adequate housing for the survivors of Katrina.\n  The Americans displaced by the hurricane are scattered throughout the \ncountry now. I want to underscore the comments made by some of my \ncolleagues earlier about the opening up of the arms of Americans across \nthe country to take people in in this time of\n\n[[Page S9793]]\n\nemergency and the great need. Families coming out of the gulf coast are \nin effect living wherever they can find a roof over their heads, with \nrelatives, with friends, with caring strangers who have volunteered to \ntake them in, in shelters--for example, Houston opened up the \nAstrodome--on cruise ships or in tents. It is fair to say if one stops \nand thinks about this for a moment it is, at best, a temporary housing \nsituation.\n  The hundreds of thousands of displaced families need to have access \nto stable housing so they can send their kids to school, start pulling \ntheir lives back together again, which is, of course, a pressing \nchallenge, seek employment and chart out a future for themselves.\n  This amendment, recognizing the overwhelming need for stable housing, \nproposes an emergency housing voucher program of $3.5 billion, which \nwould provide temporary rental assistance to more than 350,000 \ndisplaced families. It eliminates--I should say more accurately \nsuspends for a limited period of time--many of the requirements and the \nrestrictions that ordinarily apply to the housing voucher program. For \nexample, any person or family displaced as a result of Hurricane \nKatrina would be eligible to receive this much needed assistance; they \ncould get a temporary housing voucher. This is without regard to their \nincome situation. It recognizes the storm hit rich and poor alike and \nthis is an effort to give them some immediate, short-term help so they \ncan move out of the situation in which they find themselves.\n  The temporary rental vouchers would quickly and efficiently move \nfamilies into stable housing across the country in the communities to \nwhich they have relocated. So it would give them an opportunity, with \nthe voucher that would come to them, to find housing for themselves and \ntheir families. They could move out of the shelters. They could move \nout of temporary facilities. They could cease to live with relatives, \nfriends or, indeed, strangers.\n  The rental assistance will be flexible and it will be easy to use. It \nwill have payments sufficient so they can find suitable housing. The \nfunds provided could be used anywhere in the country by those who have \nbeen impacted by the hurricane whose situation was created by the \nhurricane to pay for rent, security deposits, relocation expenses and \nmoving expenses back to the affected areas at the appropriate time. So, \nif and when the time comes, they could return to their homes if that \nwas the choice.\n  The assistance would be available for an initial period of 6 months. \nIt is limited. A further 6 months is available, an extension, unless \nthe Secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development \nfinds that the assistance is no longer needed. But the maximum extent \nof these temporary housing vouchers would be 1 year. It would be 6 \nmonths, with a possibility of an extension.\n  The emergency program would be administered by HUD, which could \noperate the vouchers directly or provide the vouchers to local housing \nagencies, State and local governments or other entities, so long as the \nvouchers get out quickly to those in need.\n  We have a complicated problem here because the public housing \nauthorities, of course, are locally based. The ones in areas where the \npeople have been displaced are, in effect, out of business. There is no \nhousing there by definition, since people have had to evacuate and \nleave. These people have now been moved to different parts of the \ncountry. We need to be able to get these vouchers to them and get them \nto them quickly.\n  We know people want to return to their neighborhoods, but it will \nprobably be months before that is at all possible. Ordinarily, FEMA \nprovides trailers and other housing after a disaster. That is how \nordinarily it works. But the magnitude and scope of this disaster is \nunprecedented. FEMA has never had to deal with something of this \nmagnitude, and it was the judgment, in putting this amendment together, \nthat HUD had an expertise with respect to these rental vouchers. The \nemergency is a new dimension for HUD, but we thought that they have \ntrained staff and could take over this responsibility and move it \nforward quickly.\n  I might note that the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, \nSecretary Jackson, earlier in his career, has had very extensive \nexperience directing public housing authorities--in Washington, DC; St. \nLouis, MO, and in Dallas, TX. So he has had a lot of experience \nactually on the ground with respect to housing. We think he could \nmarshal the Department and its staff to respond in this situation.\n  This only begins to deal with the problem. I do not begin to assert \nthat this represents a total or comprehensive solution to the housing \nchallenge. But it enables us to get underway. Any family displaced by \nthe hurricane would be eligible to receive a temporary voucher to pay \nfor renting safe and decent housing, pay for rent, security, utility \ndeposits, relocation expenses, and then eventually, we hope, moving \nexpenses back to their permanent homes. These vouchers could be used \nanywhere across the country. It would not require a certification of \nincome initially in order to get the voucher, and the families would be \nrelieved of paying the rent, their portion of the rent which is \nrequired under the regular voucher program, until family members return \nto work. Once they return to work, the tenants would have to pay rental \npayments, as they do in the regular housing voucher program.\n  We are trying to cover all the bases here. We are trying to be very \nsensitive to the problem. We are trying to look at the problem through \nthe eyes of those who have been struck by the hurricane, in terms of \nhow they see it.\n  These people are now there. All kinds of makeshift housing is being \nfound for them. But that, even on a temporary basis, does not represent \nan appropriate response. So we want to move them a little further down \nthe path toward having a more normal living situation. We ease up a \nlittle bit about the amount of rent they can pay. We allow it to go a \nbit above the median instead of having to be below the median because \nwe know finding rental units will be a difficult job.\n\n  As I said, this gives authorities to HUD they do not now have to \ndirectly administer the program so they can reach out to these former \nresidents of the gulf coast who are now scattered out across the \ncountry. They can work with the housing agencies, State and local \ngovernments, and other entities. As I noted, it has a limited time \nprovision. So it would enable us to, in effect, provide all of these \npeople who have had to leave their homes an opportunity to put some \nstability into their lives. So they could then go on and deal with the \nother problems that are confronting them--the problems of getting their \nkids back in school, the problems of employment, the problems of \nmeeting all of the other pressures that have come before us. But we \nhave moved these people out. Some are being held in shelters. Others \nare being dispersed. But what is the next step for them? We think this \nrepresents the next step.\n  It is a targeted approach. The authorities it gives are temporary. \nThe limitations and restrictions it eases and removes are done on a \ntemporary basis, so it is not permanent in its eventual impact. But it \ndoes provide, for the next 6 to 12 months, a degree of stability and a \ndegree of permanence which I think is very important in enabling the \npeople who have been struck by this tragedy to help put their lives \nback together again. I very much hope, when the appropriate time comes, \nmy colleagues will support this proposal.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I wish to comment on the amendment that \nhas been offered by the senior Senator from Maryland, the ranking \nmember on Housing on the housing voucher program. I want very much to \nsupport his amendment because I think it is absolutely crucial that we \ndo this.\n  There are people who are living under three basic circumstances. No. \n1, some are shelters, which is emergency housing. God bless all of the \ncommunities, the Red Cross, the people of Texas, and everywhere that \nhave provided shelter housing. But shelter housing is for an\n\n[[Page S9794]]\n\nemergency situation, and people do need to move to stable housing.\n  Then there are those people who did evacuate. They might be of modest \nmeans, they might be of middle-class means, but they have been living \nin hotels and motels along the way. They have been living off of their \ncredit cards. They are now out of money, they are out of gas, and they \nwonder what to do next. They need to be able to move into housing. \nAlso, in order to be able to get a job, you need an address. In order \nto get a benefit, you need an address.\n  Then there is the third group of people who have been embraced by \nchurches, who are living maybe with strangers or even living with \nrelatives. But for many people, their relatives are also on a tight \nbudget, living on a shoestring or a small pocketbook. We have had \ngenerosity of spirit, generosity of heart, and even generosity of \nwallet. But that is limited until people can move into other types of \nhousing.\n  In this case, as someone who once was an appropriator for HUD, we \nneed so-called housing vouchers, known as Section 8, for either the \npoor or the elderly. Because of what has happened, everyone is poor and \nstretched to the limit, with no income. They need help. I believe this \nprogram offers both the reimbursement--the voucher--and also enough \nconstraints so that it is not a lavish giveaway program.\n  The point I also want to make is that housing is really limited, even \ntemporary housing. My colleague, Senator Sarbanes, has spoken about \nFEMA and its trailers. We know about FEMA and its trailers because we \nwere hit by Hurricane Isabel. We were absolutely grateful for them. But \nwhen I heard the FEMA trailers were coming to the Eastern Shore or \nBailey's Quarters or to Miller Island, I thought they were trailers--\nalmost a version of a manufactured home. When I went to see them and \nmeet with the people in them, they were campers. So when we hear that \nthe trailers are coming, these are not trailers the way we see in a \ntrailer park. These are kind of campers you see for an overnight and \nthey are very limited and they are also very expensive to heat or to \nair condition. But, thank God when they come.\n  Yesterday I spoke to one of the leading private-sector people who has \na substantial number, whose corporation has a substantial number of \nemployees in both Louisiana and Mississippi.\n  They tried to rent trailers and RVs to take out to their employees. \nThey were going to get hold of them and lease them--or almost rent \nfree--to their employees so the employees would have a place to work. \nThey would know where those employees were, and begin to put them back \nto work.\n  Guess what. They couldn't find any. Practically every trailer and \nevery RV in America is on its way down to the gulf. They have already \nbeen purchased or leased. We think that is great. This is a private \nsector corporation with deep pockets which is trying to jump in to \nhelp.\n  We have a sense of the magnitude of the crisis. These vouchers will \nadd an ``R'' to what we need when we talk about emergency management \nresponse. I helped to form FEMA. I will not talk about that today. We \nhave a reformed FEMA that went over to the Department called Homeland \nSecurity.\n  I believe when it did that, it lost its focus. But we had three \n``R's'' we practiced: readiness, response and recovery. I am going to \nadd a fourth ``R''--reimbursement. We have to reimburse these \ncommunities that are taking in people.\n  Look at Texas and other communities. I know your community, Mr. \nPresident, has been very generous. Again, we salute you. But we can end \nup in compassion fatigue and we need to have a government safety net.\n  I think this voucher will do a lot. I think it will also do a lot for \nmental health. If you have your own kitchen, your own stove, your own \naddress, and your children can go to school, not at a shelter--though \nGod bless the shelters--I think it will do a lot to begin to restore \npeople's sense of stability.\n  I think this is a very good idea. It is temporary. It is time \nlimited, both in terms of the flexibility of the rent, and so on. I \nthink it will go a long way to using the private marketplace and the \nprivate sector and also be able to reimburse other nonprofits that are \nalready also finding housing.\n  I salute my colleagues and the leadership for doing this, and I look \nforward to supporting it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I want to take some time to review the \nsituation we have seen in front of us for the last week. It was a \nterrible week for our country. One only had to listen to the eloquent \nremarks given by the Senator from Louisiana, Ms. Landrieu. She \ndescribed in very moving words and tones what kinds of things she \npersonally witnessed and that went on in the State of Louisiana, \nparticularly New Orleans. We all have to learn from that experience. We \nhave to be ready for any eventuality.\n  The American people watched in horror and disbelief as this \nincredible tragedy played out on live television in Louisiana, \nMississippi, and Alabama. For most of us, it was from the safety of our \nhomes or businesses that we watched with horror our fellow Americans \nsuffering unbelievable loss and pain.\n  The worst part is, as we watched this tragedy evolve, with thousands \nbeing displaced from their homes and families, without a significant \nresponse, why did they suffer so long before appropriate action was put \ninto place? That is because the Federal Government was not prepared. \nHow could the administration not have been prepared for this? We had \nadvance warning that a major disaster was looming. We see this picture. \nIt tells you what is happening. Sunday, August 28, the swirl of the \nwind and the ferocity of the action is almost enough to frighten you \njust looking at this picture.\n  August 28, Sunday, Katrina became a massive hurricane, a category 5. \nIt was in the Gulf of Mexico headed right for a large American city--a \ncity with tradition and history that all of us relate to. Actually, \nhowever, this city sat below sea level--New Orleans. The mayor of New \nOrleans on that Sunday ordered a mandatory evacuation of the city. This \nwasn't news, friends. No. This was obvious. You were going to get a \npunch in the face like you never had before, and your opponent was \nstanding full fist in front of you.\n\n  Massive flooding was predicted before the storm hit. At 6 a.m. Monday \nmorning, Hurricane Katrina and its storm surge hit greater New Orleans \nand the Mississippi coast. About 80 percent of the city's residents \nwere able to flee. Others, especially the elderly, the infirm, and the \npoor were left behind.\n  Also, on Monday, the 17th Street levee in New Orleans broke, and \nwater flooded the city.\n  One only needs to ask our junior Senator from Mississippi about the \nwave of water that destroyed his house. He told me it was 26 feet high. \nThat is more than two stories. Levees gave way, and floodwaters quickly \novertook homes. Residents scrambled for their lives, seeking refuge on \nrooftops. We all saw the vivid pictures of the heroic Coast Guard \nrescue putting people in baskets, or hanging onto them, around their \nnecks, to get them out of the way of the oncoming flood. More than 30 \nelderly residents of a nursing home died in that rapidly rising tide.\n  On Monday, August 29--remember, the first picture was Sunday. That \nwas the warning we saw going on. On Monday, August 29, many in New \nOrleans were evacuating their homes in rushing waters trying to keep \nthemselves and their families from drowning.\n  Here is a photo taken about midday that Monday. I would appreciate it \nif those who see this would keep this time in mind.\n  That terrible image--look at it. People were standing in water up to \ntheir waists. Some are up to their necks, and obviously holding \nchildren, and at the same time holding bundles on their heads to keep \nthem dry.\n  By Tuesday, we saw conditions deteriorating at the Louisiana \nSuperdome where people had already sought refuge. They suddenly needed \nto move again.\n  A reporter at the scene told grim stories of no food, no air \nconditioning, no usable water, overflowing toilets in the Superdome, \nand of tens of thousands of human beings who were stranded in these \ninhumane conditions.\n  While media members were spread across New Orleans, the Federal \nGovernment seemed to have no presence\n\n[[Page S9795]]\n\nwhatsoever. I remember personally watching Jean Meserve reporting for \nCNN, almost being blown over by the ferocity of the winds, with tears \nin her eyes, in a quivering voice. She was crying as she gave her \nreport about the horror she was witnessing. She was barely able to hold \nherself in position.\n  These desperate people trudged up elevated highways and overpasses. I \nam sure they assumed that help would soon come. But even though they \nwaited in plain sight on an elevated highway, no help arrived. So they \nbaked in the heat, and they looked desperately toward the skies for any \nhint of help. But there was little sign from the Federal Government; no \nsign of help other than the courageous Coast Guard rescue teams pulling \npeople off of rooftops.\n  On Tuesday, as this devastation was being unleashed on New Orleans, \nwhere was President Bush? He flew to California, in the opposite \ndirection of the crisis as tens of thousands of Americans were fighting \nfor their lives, many of them dying. The President was in California. \nIt was an important moment. He gave a speech commemorating VJ Day. I \nremember VJ very clearly. I was on a ship going from Europe where I \nserved during the war back to America to go on to Japan. It was an \nimportant moment. But was it important enough for the President to \nleave his post, to leave his command, when people were trying to stay \nalive? This is a picture taken on Tuesday, August 30, 2005. It was 2:56 \neastern time, which made it about 2 hours difference in central time, \nNew Orleans. The President was enjoying the day. He was strumming a \nguitar. I don't deny him the pleasures of office. But people were \ndrowning. They were trying to save their lives, save their homes, and \nsave their kids at the same time. The President was not in touch with \nthe country. It was one of the worst failures of leadership in our \nNation's history. It was like an Army preparing for battle only to find \nout that the top general has gone AWOL.\n  Millions of Americans asked: How could this happen in the 21st \ncentury in America?\n  Our hearts were broken--all of us, anybody who saw it. I remember \nconversations with family and friends, and how horrified they were to \nsee people struggling. They heard tales of children being swept from \nparents' arms, of the woman who sat with her husband as he pleaded for \nneeded medication. And he died in her presence.\n  Senator Landrieu told us the story about the man who was sent to \nprotect the mayor of New Orleans. He stayed with the mayor 3 days. When \nhe went to his home, he found that his wife and children had died. He \nwas so overcome he took a pistol and blew his head off. He committed \nsuicide. How terrible.\n\n  What many people do not understand is the incompetence of the \nleadership in their country. It seems to be almost an indifference. \nWhat many Americans concluded last week is that the Bush administration \ncannot protect us. When faced with a real crisis, the White House \ndisplayed a lack of involvement, a failure of leadership.\n  To make matters worse, our President refuses to accept \nresponsibility. President Truman--who sat at this very desk; his name \nis written here--said: The buck stops here.\n  That is not what we saw from the White House those terrible days. Now \nthe President has an idea about how to determine what went wrong. He \nwants to begin an investigation, headed by himself. An investigation of \nself is not the best way to get the facts.\n  The hurricane that struck New Orleans on August 29 was a force of \nnature. But the damage and the disaster that followed was compounded by \na failure of leadership.\n  Since the President and the President's team have already mishandled \nmuch of this tragedy, I urge my colleagues to roll up our sleeves and \nfollow the lead of Senator Landrieu, with Senator Vitter, Senator Lott, \nSenator Cochran, as we craft a plan for recovery for these devastated \ncommunities. We have a moral obligation to rebuild not just these \nbusinesses and landmarks but homes and communities, schools in every \ncommunity, regardless of class or color.\n  One of our Republican colleagues said something this past weekend, in \ntalking about the people who were suffering so much in the gulf area:\n\n       You have people who don't heed those warnings and they put \n     people at risk as a result of not heeding those warnings.\n\n  He further said there is a need to look at tougher penalties on those \nwho decide to risk it and understand there are consequences for not \nleaving; to administer more punishment to these people who did not heed \nthe warning, who did not want to leave their homes, who did not want to \nleave their familiar territory, who did not want to leave a relative, \nperhaps; to put more punishment on them, suggesting that losing a \nchild, losing a home, losing momentos, or losing a history is not \nenough. We should punish them further? A Senator suggested that. What \nan outrage. Yes, he yielded later and said he might have been \nmisunderstood. Read that Senator's words.\n  We have to learn from this terrible tragedy. The country certainly is \nalert to the risks we face from terror, from human-initiated attack. In \nthe State of New Jersey we lost 700 people; New York, almost 2,000. We \nlearned a lot. We learned we have to protect ourselves. It appears the \nnumber of dead in Louisiana and Mississippi is going to exceed the \nnumber, as terrible as it was, of September 11. So we have to prepare \nourselves in some way to deal with that problem just as ardently, just \nas thoroughly, as we fight terrorism.\n  We need to pass legislation as soon as possible. I hope we will not \nbe delayed in doing that by recriminations from those who would pass \nthe buck elsewhere, away from the place the responsibility belongs.\n  We need to tell the gulf coast community that we believe in them, \nthat the road to recovery is being built, and that we will then proceed \nto examine the history of what got us there. People understood in many \nquarters the levees were weak. The question arises about what we did to \nshore them up. I hope that examination will take place in the immediate \nfuture.\n  We salute those people who have endured the most unimaginable \ntragedy--to have loved ones swept away by flood waters, to have \nmemories taken away. In lots of places it was not just the housing but \nthe memorabilia, the trinkets of childhood, childbearing, raising kids, \nand seeing it disappear. We have to be stronger. We have to be more \nleaderly. We cannot be AWOL when trouble strikes. I hope we will work \ntogether on a bipartisan basis, as they say, and do the right thing.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1665\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf \nof myself, Senator Graham, and Senator Stabenow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan], for himself, \n     Mr. Graham, and Ms. Stabenow, proposes an amendment numbered \n     1665.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To prohibit weakening any law that provides safeguards from \n                    unfair foreign trade practices)\n\n       On page 190, between lines 14 and 15, insert the following:\n       Sec. 522. None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made \n     available by this Act may be used to negotiate or enter into \n     a trade agreement that modifies or amends any law of the \n     United States that provides safeguards from unfair foreign \n     trade practices to United States businesses or workers, \n     including (1) imposition of countervailing and antidumping \n     duties (title VII of the Tariff Act of 1930; 19 U.S.C. 1671 \n     et seq.); (2) protection from unfair methods of competition \n     and unfair acts in the importation of articles (section 337 \n     of the Tariff Act of 1930; 19 U.S.C. 1337); (3) relief from \n     injury caused by import competition (title II of the Trade \n     Act of 1974; 19 U.S.C. 2251 et seq.); (4) relief from unfair \n     trade practices (title III of the Trade Act of\n\n[[Page S9796]]\n\n     1974; 19 U.S.C. 2411 et seq.); or (5) national security \n     import restrictions (section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act \n     of 1962; 19 U.S.C. 1862).\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this is an amendment that is relatively \nsimple. It would prohibit funding in this bill for our trade \nnegotiators to enter into any agreement that would weaken U.S. trade \nlaws, such as antidumping laws and countervailing duty laws. Let me \ndescribe why these are important.\n  We have provisions in our law that establish some level of protection \nfor American industries if some foreign company or foreign country \ndecides to dump products into our country at artificially low prices in \norder to capture a market or destroy an industry. These are the \nantidumping laws. We also have laws that provide for the opportunity to \napply countervailing duties on products that come into this country \nthat are unfairly subsidized and attempt to undercut American \nbusinesses.\n  Why do I offer this amendment? Because we have U.S. negotiators who \nare engaged in WTO negotiations who are saying that everything is on \nthe table; we are willing to negotiate away the protections that exist \nfor fair trade for American businesses, American jobs, and American \nindustries.\n  We have the highest trade deficit in the history of this country. We \nhave massive numbers of American jobs moving overseas every single day. \nAmerican companies are closing their businesses, and American jobs are \nmoving overseas.\n  I have told the story repeatedly--and I will not tell it in great \ndepth again--about Huffy bicycles. They used to be an American company. \nNo longer. Huffy bikes are now made in China. Those proud workers in \nAmerica made $11 an hour plus benefits. They all got fired. Were they \nbad workers? No. That company makes Huffy bicycles in China now and \npays 33 cents an hour, working workers 7 days a week, 12 to 14 hours a \nday, and then they ship the Huffy bicycles back to this country to be \nsold.\n  Interestingly enough, since they moved to China, Huffy has declared \nbankruptcy. It has now been purchased by a Chinese company, and they \nsay they still want this to be one of the leading brands in America. \nNotice that I said ``brands.'' They don't want to make them here. It is \ntoo expensive to pay $11 to American workers to produce bicycles in \nthis country; they just want the right to sell them here.\n  I have given long speeches about the fact that Levi's doesn't make a \nsingle pair of Levi's anymore. That great American brand is now \nproduced offshore. They are made by contract production in Haiti, Sri \nLanka, Indonesia, Bangladesh, India, and China.\n  I have given speeches about the fact that if you wear your Tony Lama \ncowboy boots, they may not be American; they may be Chinese.\n  I have given speeches talking about the fact that if you like Mexican \nfood, you can eat Fig Newton cookies, because Fig Newton moved to \nMonterey, Mexico. So if you want Mexican food, go buy Fig Newtons.\n  I have given speeches at length about jobs leaving this country. We \nhave the biggest trade deficit in this country. It is dangerous. The \nquestion is, When will this country have the nerve, the backbone, and \nthe will to stand up for the economic interests of this country?\n  I am not suggesting putting walls up around this country; I am just \nsuggesting demanding fair trade. We had people die on the streets of \nthis country for the right of workers to organize. In the last century, \nwe decided issues about minimum wage, about child labor laws, about \nrules that say you cannot dump chemicals into the air and the water \nfrom your production plant.\n  We had people work very hard over a century to achieve these rules \nand regulations, which establish decent conditions of production. One \ncan now escape all that by pole-vaulting over it. Move the plant to \nChina, move the plant to Bangladesh, move the plant to Honduras and \nhire workers who will work for pennies on the dollar. Hire workers who \nwill work for 33 cents an hour. Hire 12-year-olds and pay them 12 cents \nan hour and work them 12 hours a day and then ship the product to Los \nAngeles, Detroit, Fargo, or Mobile. Meanwhile, who is going to buy \nthese products when American jobs have been lost, American workers are \ntold they are no longer affordable, their jobs are gone?\n  Little Red Wagon Radio Flyer, we all rode in that Little Red Wagon \nwhen we were kids. For 100 years that company produced in this country, \nand now it is all gone. So it can be produced more cheaply, less \nexpensively by hiring workers who will work for pennies an hour.\n  As we engage in new trade negotiations, which threaten to once again \npull the rug out from under American workers and American businesses, \nthis amendment says something very simple: We will not allow the \nfunding we have approved in this appropriations bill to be used to \nweaken our trade laws.\n  The United States-China Commission, a bipartisan commission \nestablished by Congress, sent us a letter August 1, 2005, that warned \nthat the proposals that our trade negotiators are discussing with \nrespect to antidumping and countervailing duties ``could severely limit \nour ability to protect our economic interests.'' That is from the \nUnited States-China Commission, a bipartisan commission.\n  The Commission reiterated the proposals put on the table by foreign \nnegotiators ``could have substantial impact on our nation's ability to \nutilize our trade laws and ensure that American farmers, workers, and \nbusinesses have the tools they need to respond to unfair and predatory \nforeign trade practices.''\n  So the question for us is, Are we going to do anything about that? I \nhope the answer is, yes. I hope the answer is to say to our trade \nnegotiators that we understand that foreign negotiators are proposing \nto weaken our trade laws. Our trade negotiators must have the backbone \nand the will to stand up for our economic interests, something they \nhave not been willing to do for a long time.\n  I offer this amendment, which is a prohibition on funding. It is \ngermane, and I hope to have a vote on it when we have had a proper \namount of time to discuss it.\n  One final point. I intend to offer another amendment which I cannot \noffer at this moment. It is an amendment that I will offer to other \nappropriations bills as well if it is not acceptable here, and that is \nto establish a Truman-type committee to investigate the waste, fraud, \nand abuse in contracting that is going on in the Middle East, \nparticularly in Iraq. I have described the conditions of Halliburton \nand other companies that have been given billions of dollars, have \nwasted a substantial amount of money, are now under criminal \ninvestigation, and are given a slap on the wrist and a pat on the back \nand more money and nobody seems to care. I believe there ought to be a \nTruman-type committee of the type Harry Truman headed long ago when \nthere was a Democrat in the White House and a Democratic Senator said: \nWe must investigate this kind of spending and profligate waste and \nabuse.\n  I will ask that the Senate at some point decide that there ought to \nbe oversight on what is happening to the taxpayers' money. I will offer \nthat amendment tomorrow. I have offered this amendment today for its \nconsideration, and I hope that as we go along that we will be able to \nget a vote on this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, is it appropriate to speak on hurricane \nmatters at this time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may speak on any matter he wishes \nat this time.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, Hurricane Katrina was a colossal natural \ndisaster. Every hurricane is different. They bring different stresses \nand different damages. My home is in the city of Mobile, Alabama, right \non the gulf coast. We were without power for 3 days. Trees and houses \nwere damaged. Portions of the city were flooded that have not been \nflooded before. We experienced the highest surge of water up Mobile Bay \ndriven by this storm that we have seen in anybody's lifetime there.\n  The surge in the fishing communities of Bayou La Batre and Coden were \nunlike anything they have seen before--my best estimate is 5 feet \ndeeper than we have ever seen before. I spent 3 days in that community \nworking with and talking to the people. Many of them lived in small \nframed houses, some in\n\n[[Page S9797]]\n\nmobile homes and things of that nature, that they have lived in for \nquite a long time in areas that had never flooded before but flooded \nthis time.\n  I will share a story of heroism that is symbolic of what happened, I \nam sure, throughout the gulf coast. It is regarding a young State \ntrooper a corporal, Spencer Collier, also an Alabama State legislator, \na wonderful young man, my wife and I have come to admire him so much \nwhose house flooded, as did most of the leaders of the town of Bayou La \nBatre. The town began to receive 911 calls at the height of the storm. \nHe and a marine resource officer and others, got in a vehicle and drove \ndown to where the water was rising with 100-mile-per-hour winds \nblowing. They put their boat out and, before they could cast off, the \nwater had risen so fast that the entire vehicle was flooded. They went \nout and they made the first trip to rescue stranded individuals. They \nwent out in this storm, traveling almost a mile to an area where water \nhad never reached before in this town. They rescued people and brought \nthem back.\n\n  Unfortunately, the first boat sank. Mayor Stan Wright had a flat-\nbottom boat and they put it to work. He said it was a good boat. It \nworked quite well, but the bottom was thin and they were worried about \nit. They went out in these waves and in this storm under great live oak \ntrees that were blowing, houses had been completely demolished towards \nthe beach as well as inland. The water was littered with trash and \ndebris, and they made six trips and brought people out. One lady had \nseveral children. So they left one of their group there holding two of \nthe children. They took the boat back, came back again and got the \nchildren, and they had to leave the guy because they did not have room \nin the boat.\n  All the time his house was being flooded, and he spent days, as did \nthe other members of the city government, working for the people of \nthat community, even though their own homes were flooded. So that is \nthe kind of thing we are talking about.\n  I talked to people remaining in town the next day. The storm ended \nMonday night. We still had strong winds at 5, 6, 7, even 8 at night. It \nbegan to calm down after going all day long. I talked to those people \nTuesday afternoon. Many of them were in food lines provided by the good \nold Salvation Army. They were the first ones there serving hot meals, \nwith a tub of ice and bottled water. People were lined up. They had not \nhad a meal. The electricity was all off. The phones were off. Most of \nthe cell phones did not work. Cell phone batteries quickly go down. \nThey could not make phone calls. They lined up there. Several in that \nfirst line I talked to said: Senator, this is all we have. We lost \neverything we had. These clothes on my back are all we have. We had to \nget out of our house. The water flooded everything. I don't know what \nwe are going to do.\n  I met a young lady who asked me that night what about her \ngrandfather's Social Security check? They were from New Orleans. They \nleft the New Orleans area. They had come up here. They were expecting \nto go back. I knew what she was saying. She was saying they did not \nhave any money. I called Wallace Davis of the Volunteers of America, a \ngreat organization in the Mobile area, and he really came through. I \nasked him to do what he could, and he immediately went into action. He \nbrought some of his own money.\n  He said: I have money. I am telling you I have seen hurricanes \nbefore, and some people just need a little cash.\n  They gave them a little cash, and I saw her the next morning and she \nwas a new person. That would allow them to get to other relatives and \nmaybe stay with them and get gasoline or food in that fashion.\n  So I want to say this: Many of the homes there are lost. On the east \nend of Dauphin Island, which is a sizable barrier island with a great \nmany beachfront homes on it, one-third of the homes are completely \ngone, one-third badly damaged, and one-third somewhat damaged on the \nisland. On the west end, the percentage of homes lost was even greater. \nThe homes that were for many years on beautiful Mobile Bay around Point \nClear and the Grand Hotel, homes that had not flooded before, flooded \nbecause of this surge of water. Homes that were built up high in recent \nyears under hurricane restrictions did not flood, but many of those old \nhomes suffered a good deal of damage.\n  I just say that to point out that, without a doubt, we are going to \nhave to spend more on this hurricane than we have ever spent before. \nPeople need us now. Many of these people I have talked with and I met \nwere working class American citizens not living on the beach. People on \nthe beaches, for the most part, have a second home. They have \ninsurance. Maybe they can get by, although they are going to take a big \nhit. But these people were hurting, and hurting badly. We are going to \nneed to step it up.\n  When I see the damage from the incredible force of this hurricane on \nthe Mississippi coast, our neighbors, and then in New Orleans with this \nincredible levee break and the floods there, I know we are in for a big \njob.\n  I served as a U.S. attorney for 12 years. I had the responsibility, \neven as an assistant U.S. attorney in the 1970s after Camille, to \nsurvey the aftermath. I had to prosecute people for fraud, theft, and \nabuse in hurricane cleanups. When this much money gets put out this \nfast, there is a real danger of mischief.\n  I have been in the Senate long enough to get a feel for things. I \nbelieve that the Senate is now in a bit of a hurricane mode; that all \nof Congress is--maybe even the White House--and that mode is that we do \nnot need to be too careful. We need to get money out fast, and we need \nto pour it in there, and if we need 50,000 troops, let us send 70,000 \nto make sure.\n  Now we are seeing figures that it is going to cost $200 billion to \ncomplete this reconstruction. All of us know there is no money to pay \nfor this. It is not coming out of our regular budget. That is not the \nplan. It will come in an emergency supplemental appropriations bill, \nand that means it will be added straight to the national debt, and our \nchildren and grandchildren will pay it, plus the interest that \naccumulates on it.\n  So I think this Congress is doing the right thing in moving forward \nrapidly, but I think our majority leader, our appropriations leaders, \nour House leadership, and the President also need to be thinking about \nhow to spend the money responsibly. Trust me, there will be abuses. \nPeople think we can just send our military to the region, but the \nDepartment of Defense is going to charge the disaster fund for the \nmoney they spend. These expenses will be allocated to the disaster. All \nthe other responding Federal agencies are going to bill the fund for \nthe disaster-related expenditures they incur as well.\n  We are so pleased to see that States are just doing whatever it takes \nto bring schoolchildren in from these areas and do extra things for \nthem, but we are already hearing--as we did this morning--they want to \nbe paid for it by somebody. They ought to be paid for some of that.\n\n  Governor Riley, in Alabama, has said that we will take any \nschoolchild who is in our State but cannot go home. We will take them. \nWe will put them in a school somewhere in Alabama. Our community \ncolleges have said that, no matter what, we will take you. If you don't \nhave tuition right now, we will still take you anyway.\n  While this is happening, people are making contributions and I think \nthat is important. But $1 billion is a lot of money. We probably have \nless than 5,000 homes seriously damaged in our area. Maybe it is 4,000 \nin the Bayou La Batre area, or maybe less. If you gave me $1 billion, I \ncould build 10,000 new houses worth $100,000 each. One billion dollars \nis a lot of money. A billion dollars is a thousand million.\n  But, now we are going to be in a big rush. FEMA is going to pay \npeople who did not have flood insurance. Most of them should have \ngotten it. They should have, but they will still qualify under the \ngrant program and can receive up to a maximum--all of them wouldn't get \nthis much--up to a maximum of $26,000. I asked FEMA's Mr. Burns today \nif he discussed with the Senators how much it would be, and he said the \nmaximum would be up to $26,000. That will include, I think, the $2,000 \nthat some received today. So it would be $24,000, maybe, for someone \nwho already received the money.\n  I said, when do you pay it? Apparently, we are already beginning to \npay\n\n[[Page S9798]]\n\nit. It is like flood insurance, I guess. If you have insurance and your \nhouse is destroyed and the adjuster comes out and admits your house is \ndestroyed, they write you a check, sometimes on the spot.\n  So this money is going to run out quickly. If this money is being \nallocated this quickly--before somebody has come up with a plan about \nwhich neighborhoods should be rebuilt--in Alabama, Mississippi, or even \nin New Orleans--we could end up with that money being unwisely spent \nand maybe not having enough money to help people construct the kind of \nhouses they would like.\n  Senator Shelby, I, and Congressman Jo Bonner talked with Secretary \nAlphonso Jackson of HUD when he was in Mobile, AL, last week. We \ndiscussed with him the possibility of using the FEMA money--whatever \nthey get--plus some of the loans HUD already has for people of low \nincome, to help buy a home. What if we use a small portion of these \nmillions of dollars that are coming from charitable organizations? \nMaybe we could get some real estate people and some architects to help \nus redesign some of these communities and make them both beautiful and \nhabitable--and safe so this wouldn't happen again.\n  Do you see what I am saying? There are so many things happening right \nnow, so fast. Some of this, almost by law, is required to be done in \nthis fashion.\n  We need somebody, I believe, to be a manager for the President. I am \noffering a sense-of-the-Senate resolution to call on the President to \nchoose a person of his liking to be his representative with regard to \nspending, fraud, management, and reconstruction. I believe that the \nPresident should do that. It would be a person of his choice, in the \nmode of a Mit Romney or Peter Uberhoff who were put in charge of \nOlympic Games and billions of dollars in finances at stake there. We \nneed someone with real experience who doesn't have a political agenda, \nsomeone who would come in and report to the President on a daily basis, \nreport to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, and who \ncould call on the Cabinet to help coordinate the relief. You might say \nhe will not have any power. Listen, I spent a long time in the Federal \nGovernment. I know who has power in the Federal Government. The person \nwho has power in the Federal Government is the person the President \nsays has power. If he chooses this person and he tells his Cabinet: I \nselected him and I want you to work with him. If he asks you to do \nsomething, I hope you will do it. If you can't do it, I want him to \ntell me, and you can come explain to me why you didn't do it. That is \nall it takes. Things will start work better.\n  Anyway, I am hoping something like that will happen because this is \nso massive and the potential for fraud and abuse is so great we are \ngoing to have to watch it.\n  We have towns and communities that are badly hurt. They have lost \nsales tax revenues and now they are going to be fighting for every dime \nthey can get. They are going to be pushing the rules and regulations to \nthe breaking point and beyond. We are going to have Congressmen and \nSenators browbeating us in here with stories that say: Forget the \nrules, send out the money. We all know that is going to happen. But I \ndon't think the people of my State want us to waste any money.\n  The people of my state want to help people in need. They want to be \ngenerous. They expect this Government to respond, and respond quickly, \nto take care of people whose lives are at risk.\n  The people of my state know that this is bigger than we have ever \nseen before. They know that anyone can make mistakes and that you \ncannot anticipate certain things. They want the government to \nconstantly get better and improve our response.\n  But they don't want us wasting money. They don't want us throwing \nmoney at a problem that we have not thought through carefully. They \nwant us to be careful with their money.\n  In fact, if we are careful, we can get a lot more good done for a lot \nmore communities. At this point I am not at liberty to explain to you \nwhat I think ought to be done. I am not able to. I don't know what \nought to be done and how, precisely, the money should be spent at this \ntime. But I have been there in the aftermath of hurricane cleanups, and \nI am telling you, it is a difficult thing to keep control of. The \ngovernment will spend your money before you know what happened to it.\n\n  That has happened before when there was a far smaller area of \ndevastation than we have today. FEMA is going to be stretched from \nLouisiana to the Florida line. We have more people involved here than \nalmost any hurricane ever, and the extent of the disaster is larger \nthan ever. It is going to be even more difficult to monitor this \nrecovery carefully. Some things are not going to be able to be done as \nfast as we would like to see them done. But if we do it right, I think \nwe can meet the needs of our people, be generous to the American \npeople, and also maintain the rule of law as we go forward.\n  There are some special things that are going to be needed to be done. \nI talked to Senator Lott, and he is correct. Normally, when a hurricane \nhits and a person has trees down in their yard and shingles off their \nroof, that person takes all that to the street. They are responsible \nfor it. They cut up the limbs, bring them out to the road, and FEMA \npays for someone to come by and pick it up. It is a marvelous thing, I \nam telling you. If everyone had trees down in their yard and if \neverybody had to hire a tree surgeon to come haul them away, it would \nbe an incredible cost. Volunteers come in with power saws and help \npeople do it, and neighbors help neighbors, and you get that done. But \nif your house is blown away, the streets do not just have trees \ngathered up. There are whole chunks of houses, debris, foundations, \nnails, lumber, glass, and that kind of thing. It is more than the widow \nlady or the elderly can do to get that out there to the street.\n  We are going to have to create some rules, particularly in these \nareas that are hardest hit. We must allow the Federal Government to \nhelp compensate, and it must be allowed go onto the private property \nand help get some of this debris away. Many of the people will have \nlost their jobs and don't have an income. They will not be able to have \nthat done on their own.\n  Those are some of my thoughts. I salute the majority leader and the \nDemocratic leadership for moving the $10 billion supplemental promptly. \nThat was a good thing last week.\n  Under the Anti-Deficiency Act, FEMA cannot expend a dime that has not \nbeen authorized by Congress. FEMA has already used up all of that \nmoney. It is a crime for them to violate the law that says you can't \nspend money Congress has not appropriated. The result is that we must \ncome back and do it again quickly. We are running out of money again \nquicker than we thought, and we had to respond.\n  I salute the majority leader for bringing us up to date and doing it \nfast, but I say we are moving awfully fast now. It is time for our \nleadership, both in the Congress and in the White House, to ask how can \nwe make sure we have integrity, wisdom, and good sense in handling this \ndisaster.\n  If we do so, we can make some of these communities bloom again. We \ncan make some of these towns and areas as beautiful as they were \nbefore. It has happened before. We have had disasters and we bounced \nback before, and we will bounce back again. It is the right approach.\n  I thank everybody in this country--faith-based groups, volunteers, \ncivic groups--for the resources they provided to our people in Alabama. \nWe got a call from the national group that makes modular housing and \nthey were sending five office trailers down. They agreed to send one to \nMobile. I talked to them. A group from Indiana sent in two 53-foot \ntrailers. A businessman in north Alabama sent $100,000.\n  The mayor of Ozark sent down two trucks and himself and a whole team \nto help. He adopted the city of Bayou La Batre. The mayor of Gadsden in \nnorth Alabama adopted the town of Bon Secour. Steve Means, the mayor of \nGadsden, came down and was of great help and assistance. That kind of \nthing was helping, spontaneously, with resources all across the \ncountry.\n  We are hopeful, pleased, and thankful. And that is the most common \nfeeling I have observed, as did my wife, who served in the food lines \nin Bayou La Batre and talked to people. People are thankful. It is \namazing. You begin to count your blessings and recognize what is \nimportant in life when that occurs.\n\n[[Page S9799]]\n\n  Also, people are not whining, not the people I have talked to. They \nknow this was a storm that nobody caused. They know it is a difficult \ntime. They are thankful for the assistance they have received from \ntheir neighbors, and they are not complaining about the situation. It \nhas made me proud to represent them.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1669\n\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the pending \namendments be set aside for the purpose of offering an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I ask for consideration of an amendment \nthat I had earlier sent to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Sununu] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1669.\n\n  Mr. SUNUNU. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To increase funding for the State Criminal Alien Assistance \nProgram, the Southwest Border Prosecutors Initiative, and transitional \n           housing for women subjected to domestic violence)\n\n       On page 131, line 14, strike ``$15,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$30,000,000''.\n       On page 134, between lines 4 and 5, strike ``$170,000,000'' \n     and insert ``$230,582,000''.\n       On page 134, between lines 4 and 5, strike ``$30,000,000'' \n     and insert ``$48,418,000''.\n       On page 156, strike lines 3 through 7 and insert the \n     following:\n       In addition, for necessary expenses for existing grant \n     projects of the Advanced Technology Program of the National \n     Institute of Standards and Technology, $46,000,000, to remain \n     available until expended.\n\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I offer an amendment today to make some \nchanges in the funding allocations that are found in this bill. I very \nmuch appreciate the work of the subcommittee chairman and the ranking \nmember. I know, having served on the Appropriations Committee in the \nHouse, it is not an easy task. You are asked to set a lot of \npriorities, to make a lot of decisions about a good deal of money. It \nis not an easy task, but the purpose of bringing the bill to the floor \nis to give us an opportunity to adjust those priorities. I attempt to \ndo so in this amendment in a couple of ways.\n  In this amendment I increase the funding in two general areas: first, \nin the area of border security and prosecution of illegal aliens who \nhave committed crimes. This is an area that I think many people would \nsay is in crisis right now, the problem with securing our borders, the \nproblem with illegal aliens, and specifically the problem of dealing \nwith the costs associated with illegal aliens who are committing \ncrimes, violent crimes and otherwise. In this amendment I increase \nfunding for the Criminal Alien Assistance Program by $60 million. It is \nstill well short of the funding that has been provided in the companion \nbill in the House.\n  But it is an increase which I think will be well used. It deals in \nthe area of illegal immigration and criminal alien assistance that I \nthink most everyone agrees is in a crisis situation now with the state \nof emergency having been declared in parts of the Southwest to deal \nwith this type of problem.\n  Similarly, this amendment increases funding by $18 million for the \nSouthwest Border Initiative that deals with prosecution, helping our \nSouthwestern States deal with the costs associated with prosecuting \naliens that have committed crimes against the laws of those States and \nthe Federal Government.\n  It brings that level of funding up to the President's level. I think \nthe President's request in this particular area was well warranted, \ngiven how much attention has been given to the problem of illegal \naliens in recent years.\n  This increases funding in this critical area by $78 million.\n  My amendment also provides additional funding of $50 million to \ntransitional housing for women who have been exposed to domestic \nviolence. This is a relatively new program. It is authorized at $30 \nmillion per year. The bill appropriates only $15 million. I would \nincrease that to $30 million for this transitional housing program, \nwhich is part of the programs authorized under the Violence Against \nWomen Act. Transitional housing is critical. It meets the needs of \nthose who require emergency shelter services or crisis intervention. \nThere is no other program funded by the Federal Government that \nprovides transitional housing solely for victims of domestic violence \nand sexual assault. This is not typically the case in the Federal \nGovernment. There are no other sources of funding, and we ought to \nprovide funding at the authorized level.\n  In the State of New Hampshire, there are 12 emergency shelters for \nbattered women. The average length of stay is about 27 nights.\n  Therein lies the immediate need for transitional housing. I think \nthat is probably a story that is repeated in State after State.\n  I think it is not only a worthwhile area but an area in need of \nfunds, an area where there are no other programs at the Federal \nGovernment level for meeting this need.\n  The funds that I allocate to deal with criminal alien prosecution and \ntransitional housing for those affected by domestic violence will come \nfrom the Advanced Technology Program, APT. This is a program that has \nlong been targeted for elimination. The funds over the last several \nyears have been phased down.\n  Last year, funding was provided only for existing contracts--for no \nnew contracts. I think it makes sense to at lease hold the line at that \nlevel. So I scaled back funding to a level that is appropriate to cover \nall the existing contracts so anyone who has an obligation under ATP \nwill have that obligation met. We simply would not provide funds for \nadditional contracts. I think that is the right policy. I think the \nentire program should be phased down and eliminated for a few \nfundamental reasons.\n  First and foremost, this duplicates what already exists in the \nprivate sector. The ATP program gives funding to private companies that \nare developing new programs. That is why we have a venture capital \nsystem. That is why we have the private banking system. That is why we \nhave private equity funding--to support companies that are competing in \nthe marketplace and developing new products every day. I used to work \nfor a technology firm. We developed new products, and we certainly \ndidn't look to the Federal Government to fund new product development. \nIt is a historic marketplace because inevitably you will have a \nbureaucrat in Washington deciding which new product ideas get funding \nand which do not. That is not a good idea and not a good use of public \nresources--to try to pick winners and losers in the product development \nmarketplace.\n  Finally, these are funds, resources, public funding that are going to \nprivate companies, many of which are very profitable and very \nsuccessful. We shouldn't have an industrial policy at the Federal level \nthat provides unnecessary subsidies to private corporations.\n  I think we can do better. We can find better areas in which to \nallocate these resources--dealing with illegal immigration, crimes \ncommitted by illegal aliens, and transitional housing for those \naffected by domestic violence.\n  Those are certainly priorities that are much more significant, much \nmore valuable, much more appropriate than a project that subsidizes \nprivate companies.\n  The final point about the Advanced Technology Program: It has been \nallocated at over $100 million, $150 million to $200 million, depending \non how far back in time you go.\n  I simply ask my colleagues to consider, if they were at a company, \nsay, that was developing microprocessors, and one of their competitors \nwas being given a subsidy by the Federal Government to do the same \nthing, would you think that was fair? If you were developing heating \nequipment and one of your competitors was being given a product \ndevelopment subsidy by the Federal Government, would you think that was \nfair?\n  This distorts the marketplace. It is simply not a good use of \ntaxpayer money, but we only scale it back to the extent that all \ncurrent obligations continue to be met.\n\n[[Page S9800]]\n\n  I think this is fair, it is the right thing to do, and I ask my \ncolleagues to support the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                            notice of intent\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have exerted very \n     large demands on the Treasury of the United States and \n     required tremendous sacrifice by the members of the Armed \n     Forces of the United States.\n       (2) Congress has a constitutional responsibility to ensure \n     comprehensive oversight of the expenditure of United States \n     Government funds.\n       (3) Waste and corporate abuse of United States Government \n     resources are particularly unacceptable and reprehensible \n     during times of war.\n       (4) The magnitude of the funds involved in the \n     reconstruction of Afghanistan and Iraq and the war on \n     terrorism, together with the speed with which these funds \n     have been committed, presents a challenge to the effective \n     performance of the traditional oversight function of Congress \n     and the auditing functions of the executive branch.\n       (5) The Senate Special Committee to Investigate the \n     National Defense Program, popularly know as the Truman \n     Committee, which was established during World War II, offers \n     a constructive precedent for bipartisan oversight of wartime \n     contracting that can also be extended to wartime and postwar \n     reconstruction activities.\n       (6) The Truman Committee is credited with an extremely \n     successful investigative effort, performance of a significant \n     public education role, and achievement of fiscal savings \n     measured in the billions of dollars.\n       (7) The public has a right to expect that taxpayer \n     resources will be carefully disbursed and honestly spent.\n\n     SEC. __02.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S9803]]\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Hurricane Katrina\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I want to join my colleagues and all \nAmericans in offering my condolences and my prayers to the residents of \nthe gulf region. These families have suffered grievously. They have \nlost all of their possessions. They are without homes, without \nemployment. We owe them a great deal of support and consideration, and, \nindeed, as I say again, all our prayers.\n  As news reports show, there are heroes throughout the gulf--those who \nhelped neighbors survive the hurricane and those who continue to work \nin the region to help reunite families and restore order.\n  Americans throughout the Nation are opening their homes to hurricane \nsurvivors and volunteering their time and resources to meet the needs \nof evacuees. But while this disaster shows the best that America can \noffer, it also shows the worst. It shows that the Federal bureaucracy \nis ill prepared to respond to a natural catastrophe that we knew was \npossible. It shows the Federal bureaucracy ill prepared to respond to \nfuture potential disasters.\n  It shows a government so tied up in red tape that it is not serving \nits people at their time of need.\n  In the days, weeks, and months ahead, we will be investigating what \nwent wrong, and there will be plenty of blame to pass around, but we \ncannot blame the victims of this tragedy as some have chosen to do. \nMany families in the gulf region did not have the resources or means to \nleave before Hurricane Katrina struck because this administration's \neconomic policy favored tax cuts for the wealthy over programs that \nprovide economic opportunities for all Americans. Over the last 3 \nyears, poverty has risen in America and the real median income of \nworkers stagnated. We must be willing to look honestly at how budget \ndecisions and tax policy at Federal, State, and local level left New \nOrleans residents and other communities vulnerable to this tragedy. We \nmust look honestly at how these policies continue to leave millions of \nAmericans vulnerable across the Nation.\n  Hurricane Katrina demonstrated the economic, social, and racial \ndivides that exists in America. As a Nation we must step back and \nevaluate our priorities. In my judgment, now is not the time to cut \nfunding for social programs such as Medicaid, food stamps, and \ncommunity development block grants while the administration pushes to \nrepeal the estate tax. Now is not the time to continue to provide \ncorporate tax breaks, while we must help rebuild a region in the midst \nof massive deficits as a result of the administration's policies. The \ndamage to the national economy wrought by Hurricane Katrina, the \nexpense to rebuild, and the need to provide for low-income and working \nfamilies in light of this disaster will add to our growing debt. We \nmust prioritize and deal with the needs of the most vulnerable among \nus.\n  For decades, we have known that New Orleans is in harm's way. Senator \nLandrieu has often spoken passionately about the Federal Government's \nduty to help protect wetlands in order to safeguard coastal states. \nYet, we continued to allow coastal wetlands to degrade and cut funding \nto vital programs to protect these natural buffers as well as man-made \nlevees to protect New Orleans. The flood waters from the city of New \nOrleans must be drained in an expedient fashion. However, we must not \nignore the environmental impact that these heavily contaminated waters \nwill have on the long-term public and environmental health of the city.\n  The stagnant waters engulfing New Orleans for the past week contain a \nmyriad of contaminants, including human waste, oil, and even dead \nbodies. This toxic mixing bowl is rife with disease and harmful \nchemicals. We are facing a potential ecological disaster as these flood \nwaters continue to be dumped into the surrounding area, and I am \ngreatly concerned that the impact will be seen for years to come. New \nOrleans is surrounded by Lake Pontchartrain, the Mississippi River, and \nmany precious wetlands. All of these bodies of water drain directly \ninto the Gulf of Mexico.\n  Now is the time not only to evaluate, but also to act to prevent \nfurther ecological damage in the region. More must be done to ensure \nthat while we are clearing the city of New Orleans from this \ndevastating flood, we are also working toward its future rejuvenation.\n  Our primary focus must be on getting rid of the red tape and getting \naid and assistance to those displaced by Hurricane Katrina. But we must \nalso begin to ask how did this happen. The only way to do that \neffectively and apolitically is to have an independent commission to \ninvestigate the long-term impact of Hurricane Katrina on the people of \nthe gulf region and on our Federal Government's response to this \ndisaster as well as our ability to respond to future events. The \nbicameral commission announced yesterday by the Majority Leader and the \nSpeaker is not the answer. Having the President head up a task force to \ninvestigate his Administration's response is not sufficient. The only \nway the people of the gulf region and the people of America will get \nthe answers that they deserve is through an independent commission.\n  I also support efforts to restore the Federal Emergency Management \nAgency, FEMA, to an independent, cabinet-level agency to ensure its \neffectiveness in preparing for and responding to these types of events. \nFEMA's director must have the qualifications and abilities to plan for, \nrespond to, and assist in the recovery after such an emergency. We must \ndo better.\n  As the recovery efforts for the victims of Hurricane Katrina \ncontinue, we must stand beside the survivors to provide relief and \nassistance for their immediate needs now. For this reason, I am \ncosponsoring Senator Reid's Katrina Emergency Relief Act, which will \nhelp get these families by providing medical coverage, housing the \nhomeless, educating children, and offering financial assistance.\n  Hurricane Katrina upset the lives of millions, displacing families \nfrom their homes and inflicting severe economic damage. Neighborhoods \nthat were once called home are now wastelands, and people are concerned \ntheir lives may never be the same. The economic impacts are being felt \nby low-income and working American families throughout the nation. \nIndeed, there is an imminent emergency confronting millions of low-\nincome Americans caused by soaring energy cost and diminishing \naffordability of home heating fuel as winter approaches. The \nadministration cannot ignore this looming crisis. The administration \nmust request emergency funding for the Low Income Home Energy \nAssistance Program so that these families can remain safe this winter. \nI also encourage the administration, and my colleagues, to support \ngreater investment in energy conservation programs such as the \nWeatherization Assistance Program and the State Energy Program to help \nfamilies.\n  In one way, Hurricane Katrina holds parallels to other situations. We \ncould have anticipated this phenomenon. The reports of the class V \nhurricane were available to all Federal officials, State officials, and \nlocal officials. We knew the levees in New Orleans were not designed to \nwithstand anything more than a class III. Yet we were not ready. This \nadministration ignored what should have been obvious. We had to be \nready for a severe hurricane with devastating consequences in New \nOrleans. This administration was not.\n  This also speaks to what may happen in the future. This should give \nAmericans pause if they think about another natural disaster and, God \nforbid, perhaps an intentional mass-casualty effect in the United \nStates. If we bring this same level of expertise and skill and insight, \nthen we surely will see another major disaster on our hands. I hope we \ndo not. That is why it is important to look carefully and closely at \nwhat transpired and to do so through an independent commission. I hope \nwe learn from this and apply it to the future, but most particularly, I \nhope we give real, immediate, and effective support to hundreds of \nthousands, perhaps even a million Americans who tonight still endure \nthe devastation of Hurricane Katrina.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to engage in a colloquy with \nthe\n\n[[Page S9804]]\n\nchairman and ranking member of the Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice \nand Science on funding for SCAAP, the State Criminal Alien Assistance \nProgram. I also understand my colleague from Texas, Senator Hutchison, \nwould also like to discuss the importance of this program to her State.\n  I begin by thanking the chairman, Chairman Shelby, and the ranking \nmember, Senator Mikulski, for including $200 million in funding for \nthis program, with a carve-out of $30 million for the Southwest Border \nProsecution Program. That is good. The problem is, it is not enough. \nWith the rising costs associated with criminal alien incarceration, I \nhad hoped the Senate would see fit to increase the funding for this \nprogram over last year's allocation of $305 million. Instead, it is \ndown to $200 million, with $30 million reserved for the prosecutor's \nprogram.\n  Immigration policy and control of our borders is an exclusively \nFederal responsibility. We all know this. Yet in our State prisons and \nour county jails, there is an incurrence of very heavy costs in \nincarcerating undocumented criminal aliens. Taxpayers should not have \nto foot the bill for incarcerating illegal aliens convicted of criminal \noffenses who are in State and local jails.\n  There is a growing belief among many in this country that the \nimmigration situation is out of control. This year, the Pew Hispanic \nCenter released a study which shows that between 2000 and 2004, \napproximately 3.1 million individuals entered the country without \nproper authorization. That is approximately 700,000 a year. Compare \nthat to the fact that in 2003, Border Patrol agents apprehended \nsomewhat over 1 million individuals seeking to enter the country \nillegally. It is said that for every one individual caught, three more \nenter illegally. If that is the case, nearly 3 million seek to enter \nthe country illegally in a given year.\n  These costs are borne by our local educators, our hospitals, and our \nlaw enforcement officials. Let me use California as an example. This is \nbased on a comprehensive study conducted by the Department of Finance. \nThey estimate--and this goes back to costs in 1994-1995--$400 million \nfor corrections for 23,000 individuals; $400 million for 390,000 \npatients; and $1.7 billion for K-12 education. That is a total of $2.5 \nbillion.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Certainly.\n  Mr. REID. We have a unanimous consent request to be offered on the \nemergency supplemental. We will return as soon as this is offered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n\n                 Unanimous Consent Agreement--H.R. 3673\n\n  Mr. FRIST. We will be very brief. I appreciate the consideration of \nthe distinguished Senator from California.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now proceed to \nthe immediate consideration of H.R. 3673, the supplemental \nappropriations bill from the House, with 90 minutes of debate equally \ndivided, with 30 minutes from the majority side under the control of \nSenator Coburn, with no amendments being in order. I further ask \nconsent that following the use or yielding back of the time, the bill \nbe read a third time and the Senate proceed to a vote on passage \nwithout any intervening action or debate.\n  Let me modify this. We will proceed to the immediate consideration of \nH.R. 3673 immediately following the statement by the Senator from \nCalifornia and the Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, I am wondering if the two \ndistinguished Senators from California and Texas could give us an \nindication--there are Members wanting to know when we will vote--as to \nhow much time they will require.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I have a very short time. We will wrap this up in 10 \nminutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I am happy for you to start the time running right \nnow and give us the first 5 minutes to finish this colloquy.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could, on the Democratic side the time \nwill be divided in the following manner: Senator Byrd, 15 minutes; \nSenator Reid of Nevada, 10 minutes; Senator Kennedy, 5 minutes; Senator \nDurbin, 5 minutes; and Senator Clinton, 10 minutes. That uses our 45 \nminutes.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask the unanimous consent request as \npropounded follow the completion of the statement by the Senator from \nCalifornia and the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thune). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader and the \nDemocratic leader.\n  To give a couple of recent statistics, the General Accountability \nOffice conducted a study of those criminal aliens incarcerated in \nFederal, State, and local prisons. They found the following regarding \nState jails: In fiscal year 2003, 47 States received reimbursement for \nincarcerating 74,000 criminal aliens. Four States alone spent a total \nof $1.6 billion in fiscal years 2002 and 2003 to incarcerate criminal \naliens. Yet they were only reimbursed $233 million through this \nprogram. That is only 15 percent of the total spent by these States. So \nthe Federal Government is only reimbursing States 15 percent of what \nthey actually spend on incarceration costs. That is local costs, that \nis State costs.\n  I can go on, but I want my colleagues to understand that the \ndiversion of dollars from agencies such as the Los Angeles County \nSheriff's Department to house criminal aliens has real operational \nimpact on their law enforcement activities--fighting drugs, street \ngangs, and other pressing law enforcement operations.\n\n  On March 17 of this year, the Senate agreed to a sense-of-the-Senate \namendment to the budget resolution that SCAAP should be appropriated at \na level of $750 million. While I recognize we cannot reach that number, \nthe House bill does provide $405 million for this program. As this bill \nmoves forward, I hope we will agree to the House funding level in \nconference. I ask the chairman and the ranking member to work with us \non this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank my good friend and colleague \nfrom California, Senator Feinstein, for bringing this issue forward \nagain. She has been dedicated to SCAAP funding.\n  I want to also mention Senator Jon Kyl from Arizona who has always \nstepped in when we had an appropriations bill to make sure our States \ngot some reimbursement for their costs of incarcerating illegal aliens. \nUnfortunately, as Senator Feinstein has said, we have more and more \nillegal aliens coming into our country and, unfortunately, committing \ncrimes.\n  This is a Federal responsibility. The counties along the border \nStates should not have to fund what is a Federal responsibility. \nIncarcerating illegal aliens for criminal activities is absolutely a \nFederal responsibility. So I join my colleague, Senator Feinstein, in \nurging the chairman and ranking member of this subcommittee to accept \nthe House position when we go to conference. Mr. President, $200 \nmillion does not cover a 10th of the cost to the border States in \nreimbursing them for the incarceration of criminal aliens. And $400 \nmillion goes a much longer way. I think it is a minimum.\n  All of us realize that illegal immigration must be stopped in our \ncountry. We must know who is in our country for security purposes, and \nwe must be able to deport or incarcerate people who are here illegally \nand commit crimes in our country.\n  I hope the committee chairman and ranking member will work with us to \nincrease the number from the Senate position of $200 million to the \nHouse position of $400 million, at a minimum. I thank the Senator from \nCalifornia for bringing this forward once again.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas. I also \nacknowledge as well Senator Kyl's work in this area. It seems to me \nthose of us from the Southwest or whose borders are in the Southwest \nhave been beating this drum year after year. Sometimes we make a little \nbit of progress, but very often we do not. This is a very bad year in \nterms of the amount and the need.\n  So I thank the distinguished chairman of the Military Construction \nSubcommittee. I always appreciate working with her, and this is one \nmore instance of that.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S9805]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/08/senate-section/article/S9776-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9776-S9805]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n MAKING APPROPRIATIONS FOR SCIENCE, THE DEPARTMENTS OF STATE, JUSTICE, \n   AND COMMERCE, AND RELATED AGENCIES FOR FISCAL YEAR 2006--Continued\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. For the Commerce, State, Justice appropriations, we are \nnow waiting for the chairman to give his statement. We will correct \nsome technical amendments. We are urging colleagues to come and offer \namendments. We know of six on our side of the aisle. We are doing our \nbest. We would like to be able to finish this bill today, but if we \nstart offering amendments at sundown--sundown is a great cocktail \nparty, but that is not a great way to do appropriations. So we really \nwant to do this bill because it funds the FBI, it funds the Justice \nDepartment, it funds important help to the FEMA victims. We would like \nto move it along.\n\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I first compliment my colleagues, \nSenator Mikulski and Senator Shelby, for doing such a fine job and for \nthe hard work they have done on a very important issue. I compliment my \ncolleague and neighbor from Tennessee, Senator Frist, for working so \ndiligently to get the supplemental emergency appropriations bill over \nhere so we can help our neighbors in the delta region, in the Midsouth, \nlower Midsouth region. And I again compliment my colleagues from the \nStates of Mississippi and Alabama and Louisiana for their incredible \npassion and concern, as well as their hard work and their diligent \nefforts in responding to the needs of their constituency.\n  Sitting here on the Senate floor listening to my colleague from \nLouisiana, Senator Landrieu, I thought so desperately about some \nlessons I had learned growing up along the Mississippi River. My father \nwas very emphatic about how important it is to not only have good \nneighbors but to be a good neighbor, how critically important it is \nthat you have good neighbors that can help you raise your children, \neducate them, to help out with a cup of sugar or other needs you might \nhave at the end of the month if you do not have enough, to make sure if \nyou are trying to harvest your crops--as many of our farmers are right \nnow--and you find out that to diligently get those crops out of the \nfield you may not have enough hands or equipment to do that, that you \ncan look to your neighbor to help you do that and others things.\n  I think during times like these, as we look to our neighbors from \nLouisiana and Mississippi and Alabama and the needs they have, it is \nimportant for us--as we have been the recipient of their generosity and \ntheir camaraderie and fellowship--to understand how important it is for \nus, as neighbors, to be the good neighbor they have been to us and \nwelcoming their constituency into our homes in Arkansas, to help \nprovide them not only the necessities of life--the water, the food, the \nrest, the shelter, the clothes--they might need right now in such a \ndifficult time but also to provide them the hug, the love, the comfort, \nthe stability, the idea that we will be there with them, we will be \nthere for them, as long as they need us.\n  That is why I come to the floor of the Senate today. As Senator Frist \nhas mentioned, bringing an emergency supplemental appropriations bill \nover is really critical. But as many of us know who have worked \ndiligently on so many of the components of our Government--that \nprovides assistance and aid as well as just everyday services to the \npeople we represent--it is very important to enable these agencies, \nthese providers of services the language and the ability to use these \ndollars as efficiently, as effectively, and as quickly as they possibly \ncan be used in reaching the needs of our fellow Americans whose lives \nhave been shattered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1652\n\n    (Purpose: To provide for temporary medicaid disaster relief for \n        survivors of Hurricane Katrina, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. President, I wanted to wait until the Senator from Alabama had \ncome to offer an amendment, but I do rise today to offer an amendment \nto respond to the dire health care crisis that has been created by \nHurricane Katrina.\n\n  Hurricane Katrina has created a crisis of epic proportions for our \nNation but particularly in the Midsouth region. It is a humanitarian \ncrisis for the people of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. It is a \ncapacity crisis for hospitals, for clinics, and community health \ncenters, for physicians and nursing homes that are bursting at the \nseams with a surge in demand for care, mostly emergency care, mostly \ndire care, that has been evidenced by not only those who have been \nvictimized by the dangerous natural elements but also by those who have \nbeen removed at a moment's notice from their homes where they have left \ntheir insulin, perhaps, or their high blood pressure medicine or other \nthings that allow them a quality of life and a sustainability of life \non a day-to-day basis.\n  It is a fiscal crisis for the States directly affected as well as \nthose which have welcomed the displaced survivors, including Arkansas, \nFlorida, Oklahoma, Texas, and so many other States. When New York City \nfaced a\n\n[[Page S9777]]\n\nsimilar set of crises after 9/11, the city turned to Medicaid, the \nFederal-State partnership of health care for the poor, to provide \ntemporary coverage for victims of the tragedy. Our Nation's health care \nsafety net met the needs of millions of New York families, ensuring \nthem access to comprehensive health care services.\n  Current law restrictions on Medicaid eligibility impede our efforts \nto let Medicaid provide a safety net for Katrina's victims. Under \ncurrent law, low-income individuals must be residents of a State in \norder to qualify for Medicaid coverage in that State. Once the \nindividual is determined eligible and enrolled in Medicaid, Federal and \nState Governments share in the cost of purchasing medically necessary \nservices from hospitals, clinics, and other providers. The amount the \nState pays varies from State to State--from 29 percent in Louisiana to \n39 percent in Texas to 50 percent in the State of Virginia.\n  Katrina has displaced tens and perhaps hundreds of thousands of \ncitizens of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama who have lost \neverything and who will not be able to return to their homes until \ntheir communities are rebuilt. We are looking here to put into place \nsome commonsense directives, some flexibility to allow these \nindividuals to be able to access the kind of health care we in this \nNation know they need and as Americans we want to provide.\n  These citizens cannot return to their homes and may not return to \ntheir homes for months, but under current Medicaid law, they are only \neligible for benefits as residents of their home State. Under current \nlaw, Medicaid services can only be provided if the State puts up its \nown money for the match for the survivors, but the States directly \naffected by Katrina and those hosting the survivors will not be able to \nput up their match payments due to the fiscal crisis Katrina has \ncreated. This could put Medicaid coverage for our Nation's neediest \nindividuals in jeopardy.\n  We want to prevent that from happening. We want to assure our \nproviders and those in the communities who are there to wrap their arms \naround their fellow Americans--their neighbors, many of them to the \nsouth or to the east or wherever their neighbors from Louisiana, \nAlabama, and Mississippi have come from--that the Federal Government \nhas the common sense and the wisdom to be able to provide these \nservices with the flexibility and without the redtape that in many \ninstances would cause providers to turn them away.\n  In the face of the public health, and State budget crises Katrina has \ncreated, current law is not plausible. If normal application procedures \napply, the displaced survivors will face delays in establishing their \neligibility for Medicaid. The providers serving them during these \ndelays will not be reimbursed until after eligibility is established \nand may not receive reimbursement for their services at all. And for \nmany of us from States that already have a disproportionate share of \nlow-income individuals who depend on Medicaid services, this could be \ndetrimental to not just those who are surviving Katrina but those who \nare hosting those victims and those survivors as well. The host States \ncould incur large, unexpected increases in their Medicaid costs at the \nsame time their revenues are reduced by the economic dislocation caused \nby Katrina.\n  What we are looking for here is something very similar to what we did \nin New York--to try to provide that flexibility that is needed, \nstreamlining those services, and, more importantly, making sure the \npaperwork is not the mountain of paperwork that so many are used to but \nthat they are simplistic and something that can expedite getting the \nneeds of these individuals met.\n  This is a critical issue that has to be addressed immediately. Our \nStates and our fellow Americans deserve it. To address these crises, I \nhave proposed the temporary disaster relief Medicaid amendment.\n  The amendment, just briefly, is as follows:\n  It would provide the Katrina survivors with health coverage through \nMedicaid wherever they find refuge. A simplified eligibility and \nenrollment process would be created for people from Federal disaster \ncounties in Mississippi and Alabama and Federal disaster parishes in \nLouisiana. It would be extended to those who live in those States and \nwho have lost their jobs since the Hurricane Katrina crisis has \nhappened. This, again, is something very similar to what we did in New \nYork after 9/11. Using what we have learned there, we want to expedite \nthese services for the victims today.\n  We want to make it easy for health providers to care for Katrina \nsurvivors. Once enrolled, Katrina survivors who are in other States \nwould receive Medicaid as though they were Medicaid enrollees in that \nvery State. Medicaid would also temporarily finance people's private \ninsurance if they have access to it. This means no new systems or rules \nfor health care providers so they can again rest assured that they are \nproviding these services and will still be able to maintain their \nwholeness in providing services to their own communities.\n  It would guarantee Federal funding for health care for Katrina \nsurvivors. The Federal Government would fully finance the cost of \nproviding Medicaid to Katrina survivors in any State in which they are \nenrolled. Additionally, the scheduled decline in some States' Medicaid \nmatching rate for fiscal year 2006 would be canceled.\n  Mr. President, you may be certainly well aware, as many of us are \nhere in the Senate, that the Federal matching rate was due to change as \nof October 1 of this year. We want to make sure we extend, for those \nwho are affected, the current Federal matching rate in order to be able \nto maintain their wholeness and for those to be able to continue to \noffer their services, as a good neighbor wants to, to those victims of \nthis crisis. This would continue for 6 months, with a possible \nextension for another 6 months if the need exists and continues.\n  It would also ensure a smooth transition to the Medicare drug benefit \nfor Katrina survivors. In addition, parts of the implementation of the \ndrug benefit would be delayed in States directly affected by the \nhurricane, along with their neighbors. Specifically, the transition of \n``dual eligibles'' from Medicaid to Medicare--as well as the \n``clawback'' payments, which we discussed at great length when we did \nthe Medicare reform package--would be temporarily suspended to prevent \nsurvivors from losing their drug coverage. We have tried--and I know I \nhave in my own home State, having supported the Medicare reform \npackage--to make sure the information is out there for the elderly and \nthe disabled and those who use Medicare as to what their opportunities \nand options are through Medicare, particularly the new Part D Medicare \ndrug component.\n  For the low-income, there is an incredibly good component of the \nMedicare drug piece in the Medicare reform package. All of these are \navailable, but they do have deadlines. They do have deadlines. The \nenrollment begins on November 15 of this year. Those who do not enroll \nin a drug plan by May 15, 2006, this coming spring, will see a premium \npenalty. Many of us have learned, as we have delved into Medicare over \nthe years, that those others receive premium penalties if they don't \nsign up for Medicare on time. We want to make sure those kinds of \npenalties don't exist for victims who find themselves not only \ndisplaced from their families, their homes, their regular medical \nproviders, but also all of their information, their documents, the kind \nof information and certainly the normalcy of life that allows one to go \nthrough that kind of paperwork and try to make the best decisions \npossible.\n\n  The requirement of proof of assets for the low-income drug benefit \nwould be delayed. As we know, many of these individuals have no idea if \ntheir old job will be there; will there be a new job; how long it will \ntake for these businesses to rebuild, to replenish, to be back in \naction. There are so many who are dealing with so much unknown. It is \ncertainly our responsibility, not only as legislators but as fellow \nAmericans, to recognize they need time. They need time and flexibility \nto work through these issues and to access the programs that we have \nvery carefully designed to fit their needs.\n  The penalties for not immediately enrolling in Medicare and its drug \nprogram would also be temporarily suspended. Providing this \nassistance--certainly the dollars Senator Frist spoke of, the ability \nto make sure that the\n\n[[Page S9778]]\n\nvictims, our fellow Americans who have gone through such atrocities, \nand the health care providers in the communities who want to be there \nto serve them, making sure of the technical parts of this recovery--is \nour responsibility. I hope the managers of the bill will understand how \nimportant it is for us to move quickly to ensure that those who are \nproviding the relief and those who are receiving it can take it with \ngreat comfort levels that they won't have to deal with the bureaucracy \nbut that they will be dealing with a compassionate Federal Government \nthat understands the necessity of making this process more streamlined \nand more accessible.\n  It is not only the right thing to do; it is what we must do to ensure \nthat our Nation's safety net does not unravel in the face of this \ngrowing national emergency. We still have the precautions in here. We \nstill have the fraud and abuse precautions that exist in our current \nlaw. We just want to make sure that our fellow man, our fellow \nAmericans, in a time of dire need, as has been described eloquently by \nSenators from those States who have been there with these individuals, \nfor those of us who are from States where they are coming, seeing these \nindividuals coming in--we had a group come in through Fort Chaffee, AR, \nalmost 10,000 evacuees processed in about a 12-hour period, all of whom \ncame with what they had left in a plastic sack, perhaps, who had been \nsitting on buses for almost 2 days while people figured out where they \nshould go, what they should do, where they should be sent, who should \nbe taking care of them. We don't want that to happen in their medical \ncare and in their access to the kind of things that we know they are \ngoing to need now and they are going to need in the coming weeks and \nmonths.\n  I hope we will do our homework quickly. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this amendment to create temporary disaster relief Medicaid \ntoday. I ask them all to think about how they would feel, many of whom \nhave experienced it. Senators from Alabama and Mississippi and \nLouisiana who have lost their homes and have found their family members \ndisplaced can understand how heavy the hearts are of our fellow \nAmericans who have been victimized by this incredible storm. We, in our \nway, can help in bringing down the wall of bureaucracy and redtape to \nallow them the helping hand that we can provide.\n  I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mrs. Lincoln] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1652.\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I am pleased to present to the Senate the \nCommerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies appropriations bill \nfor fiscal year 2006. Since August 25, our Nation has been gripped by \nthe devastation and destruction left in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. \nWe have all watched in horror as this category 4 hurricane ravaged an \nentire region, and each of us share in the sorrow of those who have \nlost their lives and their livelihoods. I am confident that the \nstrength of the American spirit will rise to this challenge and, just \nas we have many times before, that we can and will recover.\n  The bill before us today provides funding for many U.S. Government \nfunctions that are critical to hurricane prediction, response, and \nrecovery. The Small Business Administration provides low-interest loans \nto disaster victims to rebuild their homes and businesses. The Economic \nDevelopment Administration, under the Department of Commerce, can make \nfunds available to distressed communities to help repair their physical \ninfrastructure. Under the Department of Justice, State and local law \nenforcement assistance grants can help provide relief to gulf coast law \nenforcement agencies. Finally, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration is one of three lead agencies responsible for \nresearching, forecasting, monitoring, and warning of hurricanes.\n  It is timely that this bill is being considered on the Senate floor, \nand I commend the leader for recognizing how important it is to send \nthis bill to the President.\n  This afternoon, I want to take a moment to provide some general \nbackground about the bill before us and the programs it funds. The \nreorganization of the Appropriations Committee earlier this year \nsignificantly changed the jurisdiction of the subcommittee. The newly \nformed subcommittee has jurisdiction over the Departments of Justice \nand Commerce, as well as the National Aeronautics and Space \nAdministration, the National Science Foundation, and a number of \nindependent agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission, \nthe Federal Trade Commission, the Federal Communications Commission, \nand the Small Business Administration. The major areas of jurisdiction \nof the CJS bill are counterterrorism, Federal, State, and local law \nenforcement, our Nation's economy, regulation of the banking and \ntelecommunications sectors, scientific research, including programs to \nstudy the oceans and atmosphere, and our Nation's space program.\n  In a year when domestic discretionary dollars are scarce, it has been \nour goal to ensure that the priorities of our Nation and our States are \nmet while remaining within our allocation. I believe we have \naccomplished those savings wherever possible and that we have allocated \nlimited resources to meet the highest priority programs. These \npriorities include bolstering our capabilities for fighting terrorism, \nassisting with law enforcement activities at the State and local level, \nmeasuring and strengthening our Nation's economy, furthering scientific \nresearch, and reforming and reenergizing our Nation's space program. In \nthe wake of three successive hurricanes last year and now Hurricane \nKatrina, we have also taken steps to ensure our Nation's ability to \npredict and monitor hurricanes. And we have done what we reasonably \ncould within our purview to improve our response and recovery \ncapabilities.\n  The total amount recommended is $885 million above the fiscal year \n2005 level at this point in the debate, which is a 2-percent increase. \nThese numbers might suggest that the bill is well below the budget \nrequest. However, the bill does not include the proposed Strengthening \nAmerica's Communities Initiative. The President's budget request for \nthe Department of Commerce included $3.7 billion to implement this new \nprogram. The bill before us does not reflect the President's proposal \nto transfer and significantly reduce these programs.\n  Another noteworthy aspect of the bill is that it includes an increase \nof over $1 billion above the budget request for the Department of \nJustice. This is mainly due to the restoration of the proposed cuts to \nState and local law enforcement grants. I know the Presiding Officer is \nvery involved in that. The bill also recommends nearly $7.2 billion for \nthe Department of Commerce, including NOAA and NIST, which is an 8-\npercent increase over last year's funding level. Many Department of \nCommerce programs were proposed for termination in the President's \nbudget for 2006. Rather than terminating these programs, the bill \nbefore us includes funding for the Economic Development Administration, \nwhich is so important to every State, the public telecommunications \nfacilities, planning and construction grants, and the Technology \nOpportunities Program.\n  In the science title of the bill, we have restored the 8-percent \nreduction from last year's enacted level that was proposed by NOAA. \nThere is continued frustration among many of my Senate colleagues about \nthe Department's repeated request to reduce NOAA funding. NOAA provides \nmany critical functions to hurricane prediction and warning. Further, \nour oceans and atmosphere constitute one of our most precious natural \nresources, and I believe we can all appreciate the importance of both \nto human subsistence. I believe we should be increasing NOAA's budget, \nas the bill does, not cutting it.\n\n  In addition, this bill provides funding for NASA to move forward with \nthe exploration vision while fully funding the ongoing activities of \nthe space shuttle and the International Space Station.\n\n[[Page S9779]]\n\nThe recommendation fully funds constellation systems and provides NASA \nwith funds to prepare a servicing mission to the Hubble space \ntelescope. Many of NASA's facilities in the gulf region sustained \nsignificant damage from Hurricane Katrina, and we have not addressed \nthose issues in this bill. We expect to address them in the next \nsupplemental spending measure that will be considered.\n  Finally, in the related agencies title of the bill, we include full \nfunding for the Securities and Exchange Commission, for the Federal \nCommunications Commission. The recommendation rejects a number of \nproposed program eliminations within the Small Business Administration.\n  This, overall, is a pretty lean bill. We had to work with our \nallocation. We had to make tough decisions to get here. I think my \ncolleagues will find that this bill does support core functions and \neven provides increases where critical. The bill addresses the most \npressing needs that were brought to our attention both by the \nadministration and by my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. Overall \nwe believe we have crafted a bill that reflects the priorities of this \ncommittee, as well as of the entire Senate.\n  I take this opportunity to thank Senator Mikulski, my friend and \ncolleague, who is the ranking member on the committee. We have worked \ntogether this year, as we have in many years, to produce a bill that is \nfair and forward looking under intense time and budget constraints. I \nlook forward to continuing to work with Senator Mikulski on the Senate \nfloor and in the future.\n  I also reiterate the leader's position, which is that we must act on \nthis bill expeditiously. I urge my colleagues to come to the floor and \noffer their amendments. I will try to work with them, but let's act in \na timely manner. Time is of the essence now.\n\n\n               Amendments Nos. 1655 through 1658, en bloc\n\n  Mr. President, I now send a series of amendments to the desk. I ask \nthat the amendments be considered read and agreed to, the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements relating to \nthese amendments be printed in the Record, with all of the above \noccurring en bloc. These amendments have been cleared on both sides of \nthe aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments were agreed to, as follows:\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1655\n\n       On page 144, line 10, strike ``$409,625,000'' and insert \n     ``404,625,000''.\n       On page 152, between line 20 and 21, insert the following: \n     ``United States Travel and Tourism Promotion\n       For necessary expenses of the United States Travel and \n     Tourism Promotion Program, as authorized by section 210 of \n     Public Law 108-7, for programs promoting travel to the United \n     States including grants, contracts, cooperative agreements \n     and related costs, $5,000,000, to remain available until \n     September 30, 2007.''.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1656\n\n (Purpose: To provide funding and personnel for the National Hurricane \n                                Center)\n\n       On page 170, between lines 9 and 10, insert the following:\n       Sec. 304. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, \n     of the amounts made available in this title under the heading \n     ``National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration'' and under \n     the subheading ``operations, research, and facilities'', not \n     less than $5,800,000 shall be made available for the National \n     Hurricane Center and that such amount may be used to employ \n     individuals in 43 full-time equivalent positions at the \n     National Hurricane Center.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1657\n\n       On page 173, beginning in line 2, strike ``: Provided \n     further,'' and all that follows through ``this Act'' in line \n     10.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1658\n\n (Purpose: To expand the disaster loans that shall not be sold by the \n                     Small Business Administration)\n\n       On page 188, line 10, after ``Alaska'' insert ``or North \n     Dakota''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeMint). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have an amendment to this bill that I \nwill be offering shortly along with Senator Smith of Oregon, my \ncosponsor, and cosponsored by Senators Bingaman, Wyden, Feingold, and \nKennedy.\n  This amendment will increase the amount of money going to legal aid \nprograms across the country from $324.5 million to $358.5 million.\n  Again, this amendment will throw a lifeline of legal services \nassistance to people in need.\n  I point out that this is $4 million less than what the Legal Services \nCorporation requested in their budget earlier this year. The reason it \nis slightly less is because we had to do that to get the proper offset \nfor the amendment. Forty-five Members of the Senate, on a strong \nbipartisan basis, sent a letter to the chairman and ranking member \nearlier this year seeking the full funding for legal services, which \nwas $362.5 million. As I said, this amendment is $4 million less than \nwhat 45 Members of the Senate, on a bipartisan basis, requested earlier \nthis year.\n  I also point out that 25 percent of the increase goes specifically to \nthose programs providing assistance to victims of Hurricane Katrina.\n  Even before the devastation and displacement of Katrina, this \nincrease was sorely needed. That is because today, as I stand here, 50 \npercent of the people eligible for legal services in America are being \nturned away because the programs simply are underfunded.\n  Keep in mind, to even be eligible for legal services, one must be \nbelow 125 percent poverty. That means for a family of four, you have to \nhave less than a $23,000-per-year income to even qualify for legal \nservices. Again, we are now turning away half of the families in \nAmerica who need civil legal help who make less than $23,000 a year. \nThat is not justice.\n  Furthermore, the clients served by legal services are overwhelmingly \nfemale. Seventy-two percent of the clients served by legal services are \nwomen, most of whom are seeking help with domestic abuse issues, \nincluding custody, retraining orders, and safe housing.\n  Legal services is also the only assistance most low-income women have \nin getting and keeping safe, habitable housing. It is critical in \nreducing homelessness among women and children.\n  In the last 2 years, cuts to legal services programs have resulted in \nthe loss of funding for 200 attorney positions. Every single one of \nthose attorney positions means at least 385 people a year not able to \nget the legal help they need.\n  To sum it up, last year, legal services was forced to serve 77,000 \nfewer people than they did the year before.\n  The Senate bill before us today, instead of taking a small step to \nfix this injustice, imposes an additional $6 million in cuts to legal \nservices programs. This is simply unacceptable.\n  I don't want anyone here to think this amendment we are offering is a \ndrastic fix to the problem. All this amendment does is restore funding \nfor legal services to the fiscal year 2003 level adjusted for \ninflation. This amendment restores legal services funding to the 2003 \nlevel.\n  If we were serious about providing equal justice under law for all of \nour citizens and providing the resources that legal services really \nneeds, we would restore legal services to the 1995 funding level of \nover $500 million a year.\n  Think about it this way: Since 1995, we have cut legal services, the \nonly civil legal help poor people have in this country, by a third. And \nneed I remind anyone what has happened to poverty since 1995? Has it \ngone down by a third? No; it has gone up. So poverty has gone up, and \nwe have cut legal services by a third since 1995. Unconscionable.\n  This, of course, is the picture legal services was facing before \nHurricane Katrina. Legal services always plays a critical role in a \nnational disaster, but this disaster will impose more burdens and more \nchallenges than ever before. That is why this amendment devotes $8 \nmillion or, as I said, 25 percent of the increase goes to programs \ndirectly helping victims of Hurricane Katrina. Again, is that enough? \nHardly. This will be a small downpayment on the funding that will be \nneeded, and I hope will be provided, in some of the supplemental \nfunding bills coming down the road.\n  I heard the majority leader today saying there is going to be a \nsupplemental on the floor today. I don't know what is in it, but there \nbetter be something in it to help legal services serve the people \ndisplaced. We have to have immediate assistance to these programs to \nhelp assist people in the largest displacement in this country since \nthe Civil War. Think about it: The largest displacement of people since \nthe Civil War.\n\n[[Page S9780]]\n\n  One might say people need food, water, they need clothing, they need \nshelter, they need schooling. Yes, they need all those immediate needs. \nBut here is why they are going to need legal services immediately, not \na year from now.\n\n  Let me share with you an e-mail from the State director of the \nAlabama program, one of the hardest hit States, describing what they \nwill be doing in the next few weeks:\n\n     . . . legal services programs are traditionally a critical \n     partner in long-term disaster response. We will be doing \n     everything from trying to clear title for FEMA award purposes \n     (many low-income folks land in houses passed from generation \n     to generation without any formal conveyance . . . ); to \n     contractor fraud; to handling credit problems for folks who \n     are trying to get SBA or other loans with which to rebuild \n     their lives. Not only will we be helping victims of Hurricane \n     Katrina [in this State], but there are over 35,000 evacuees \n     from Louisiana and Mississippi in the State. Every one of our \n     offices in the State will be serving Hurricane Katrina \n     victims with already scarce resources.\n\n  So it is not something they are going to need a year or two from now, \nthey need it now because, in the initial stages, legal services will be \nresponsible for helping hundreds of thousands of people navigate the \nsystem for obtaining disaster-related food stamps, unemployment \ncompensation, and housing assistance. They will be on the frontlines \nrepresenting people with the agencies to get the needed relief.\n  Legal services will be the best on-the-ground arbiters of whether \ndeadlines need to be extended to reach the hundreds of thousands \neligible for assistance.\n  I have a little experience in this from both standpoints: One, I was \na legal services attorney before I came to Congress. That was my job. \nSo I know a little bit about how legal services work and who they \nserve. Second, our State of Iowa in 1993 was hit by a devastating \nflood. Every single one of our counties--99 counties--was declared a \ndisaster area. Some of our small towns were totally wiped out.\n  So I have a great deal of sympathy and empathy for what is going on \nin New Orleans. We saw whole towns in our State underwater. Some of \nthem were never rebuilt. We had to move people to other places.\n  That was 1993. Legal aid lawyers represented thousands of clients in \nthe State of Iowa in landlord-tenant disputes about the ability to \nterminate leases of uninhabitable property. They assisted people in \nIowa with a whole range of issues.\n  In one example, there was a certain FEMA determination that a woman \nwas not entitled to compensation because the property was in the name \nof an ex-spouse. It turned out it was not an ex-spouse; it was her \nspouse who had died, and only legal services could help clear this up \nfor this poor woman. She didn't have enough money to hire an attorney. \nAs I said, to be qualified, one has to have an income of less than 25 \npercent of the poverty level.\n  Another example of what they did in Iowa: FEMA determinations that \nmassive property damages were, in fact, preexisting conditions; \ndeterminations of SBA loan eligibility.\n  This all happened in Iowa in 1993, so I know what it means to go \nthrough a devastating flood such as this and to have people who are \nhomeless, without housing, with no place to go and needing the help of \nlegal services to navigate, to find out what they can get, to know for \nwhat they are eligible.\n  In the situation we are now facing, much bigger than the flood of \nIowa, legal services lawyers will be trying to represent clients who \nhave no access to their homes, many who are temporarily living out of \nState. At least that did not happen in Iowa, at least not to any great \nextent. There are evacuees in Texas, in Arkansas, some in Washington, \nDC. Providing legal help to those most in need is critical in this \ninstance.\n  Beyond the immediate need of helping the victims of Hurricane \nKatrina, legal services is critical to reducing violence in this \ncountry. When people cannot get results through the legal system, they \nresort to extralegal means. We have seen that in all areas of the \ncountry. We have seen that sometimes in disaster areas in the last \nweek, and we should expect to see more if we cannot quickly get legal \nhelp to the people displaced.\n  It is not true because of Hurricane Katrina; it is true in everyday \ndisputes. Having access to quality legal help reduces tensions, focuses \npeople on compromise, negotiations. Legal services reduces the burdens \non our courts. They help to ensure that those people with disabilities \nget the benefits to which they are entitled.\n  That is why the Legal Services Program has the complete support of \nthe American Bar Association and every State bar in the United States. \nI point out that the American Bar Association supports the amendment we \nare offering.\n  Let me add that this amendment is fully offset, as it stands now.\n  I want to also add Senator Obama as a cosponsor to this amendment.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. As I said, 45 \nSenators signed a letter earlier this year seeking this level of \nfunding; $4 million actually more than what we are asking for in this \namendment.\n  So I hope and trust that we will hold this in conference. We cannot \ncontinue to say we are a nation of equal justice under law when the \npoverty rate keeps going up and the amount of money we are giving the \nLegal Services keeps going down. Poor people are being excluded from \nour civil justice system. That is wrong. It should not happen in this \ncountry.\n  So this year, next year, the year after, I will be here, and I am \nsure along with many others on both sides of the aisle, saying we have \nto get this funding back up. Our courts are plugged with people \nsometimes with crimes that have to do with property. How many of those \nmight have been forestalled if they had had Legal Services help--or \ncourts plugged because someone is there because of domestic violence. \nIt could have been forestalled if people had had Legal Services.\n  So that is why we need to get the Legal Services Corporation back up \nto the level it was at least in the mid-1990s, and actually it probably \nshould be more than that because of the huge increase in poverty in \nthis country.\n  So if my colleagues believe in equal justice under law, if they \nbelieve an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, if they \nbelieve by a little bit of money upfront helping people solve their \nlegal problems, domestic violence problems, and things like that it \nwill help keep people out of court, which we have proven is true, then \nwe ask for support for this amendment, and hopefully we can hold this \namount when we go to conference.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1659\n\n  I send the amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nlaid aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin], for himself, Mr. Smith, \n     Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. \n     Obama, proposes an amendment numbered 1659.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To increase the appropriation for nationwide legal services \n field programs and to provide additional funds to programs providing \n          legal services to the victims of Hurricane Katrina)\n\n       On page 175, strike lines 6 through 9 and insert the \n     following:\n       For payment to the Legal Services Corporation to carry out \n     the purposes of the Legal Services Corporation Act of 1974, \n     $358,527,000, of which $346,251,000 is for basic field \n     programs and required independent audits (of which $8,000,000 \n     is for basic field programs providing legal assistance to \n     victims of Hurricane Katrina)\n\n     Notwithstanding any other provisions in the Act, the sums \n     appropriated for the Department of Justice are reduced by $37 \n     million. This reduction is to be taken by the Attorney \n     General from accounts receiving an increase in travel and \n     transportation of persons as specified in the President's \n     Fiscal Year 2006 Budget Submittal to Congress pursuant to 31 \n     U.S.C. section 1105 and which are in excess of the fiscal \n     year 2005 level;\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to speak in support of \nSenator Harkin's amendment to add $38.2 million to the reported funding \nlevel for the Legal Services Corporation, and am\n\n[[Page S9781]]\n\nproud to join him as a cosponsor. I was one of 47 colleagues joining in \na bipartisan letter in June urging the subcommittee to support the \nLegal Service Corporation quest for $363.8 million.\n  Liberty and justice for all is one of America's most cherished \nprinciples, and a fundamental part of the very fabric of our Nation. \nOur Founding Fathers fought a revolution for it. Thousands of brave men \nand women since then--from Abraham Lincoln to Susan B. Anthony to \nMartin Luther King and all who fought with them--risked their lives to \nensure that the principle of justice for all truly applied to all \nAmericans. And today, thousands of men and women of our armed forces \nare fighting and sacrificing their own lives to secure these freedoms \nfor the people of Afghanistan and Iraq.\n  Justice for all knows no political exclusivity. It is not a Democrat \nor Republican value, but an American value. At the opening of each and \nevery session of this Senate, we stand together and pledge our \nallegiance to this founding principle. Millions of schoolchildren \npledge their allegiance every day to this fundamental tenet of our \ncountry.\n  Yet today in Illinois and throughout the United States, we are \nfalling far short of fulfilling our Nation's promise of ``justice for \nall.''\n  A recently released study, ``The Legal Aid Safety Net: A Report on \nthe Legal Needs of Low-Income Illinoisans,'' found that over the course \nof a year, tens of thousands of less fortunate Illinois residents were \nunable to obtain legal assistance that was often critical to their \nsafety and independence. Hundreds of thousands more attempted to solve \noften complex legal problems on their own.\n  Studies in other parts of the country have reached similar \nconclusions. Millions of Americans are being shut out of our civil \njustice system, with grave consequences for themselves personally and \nfor our country as a whole when legal assistance is not available to \nthem. We are a long way from fulfilling our Nation's promise of equal \njustice for all.\n  This widespread lack of access to justice can only be described as a \ncrisis for our country, and with increases in the poverty rate \ncompounded by the vast devastation to so many of our fellow citizens \ncaused by Hurricane Katrina, it will only get worse if we do not act.\n  Those being left behind by the alarming gap in access to our justice \nsystem are our friends, relatives and neighbors. They are children, \nfamilies and the elderly of diverse creeds and backgrounds, and they \noften are the men and women fighting for our country and their \nfamilies.\n  The story of a young man in our armed forces from Galesburg, a small \ncity in the western part of Illinois, is a prime illustration. Before \nbeing deployed to Iraq, he visited Prairie State Legal Services, an \norganization funded by the Legal Services Corporation that serves \nresidents in 36 mostly rural counties in northern Illinois, to seek \nhelp in getting a power of attorney and will prepared so that if \nsomething happened to him his family would know what to do.\n  Other examples of the Americans who are helped every day by legal aid \ngroups funded by the Legal Services Corporation--and for too many of \nwhom help is not available--include a woman and her children victimized \nby domestic violence seeking an order of protection and child support \nto give them a fair chance to start a new life, a senior couple facing \nforeclosure of the only home they have ever lived in after being \nvictimized by consumer fraud, a World War II veteran who served his \ncountry so well but now is being denied the benefits we have promised \nhim, and numerous other less fortunate residents facing legal matters \ncritical to their safety and independence as they try to pursue the \nAmerican dream.\n  The legal aid system in Illinois is able to address only a small \nfraction of the civil legal problems encountered by low-income \nIllinoisans. The ``safety net'' is inadequate and fraying. Low-income \nIllinoisans faced over 1.3 million civil legal problems in 2003--from \nchild custody disputes to mortgage foreclosure to physical and \nfinancial elder abuse. Low-income Illinoisans had the assistance of an \nattorney for only one of every six legal problems they encountered. \nIllinois's legal aid system is facing critical shortage of resources, \nwith layoffs and hiring freezes becoming widespread at programs \nthroughout the State.\n  The Legal Services Corporation has historically been grossly \nunderfunded. In 1996, Congress reduced funding by 33 percent--from $415 \nmillion to $278 million, resulting in closure of more than 100 legal \naid offices across the country. By fiscal year 2003, the appropriation \nhad been increased to $338.8 million, but levels have steadily declined \nas a result of Government-wide reductions.\n  The Legal Services Corporation has already had to absorb $9 million \nin cuts over the last 2 years. That translates to almost 200 attorney \npositions across the country who are no longer helping those in need of \nlegal assistance. Just in the last 2 years, the number of people that \nwere able to receive needed services declined from 978,000 to 901,000. \nThree States are experiencing layoffs and many other States have a \nhiring freeze in place that has led to as many as one third of the \nstaffing positions being vacant.\n  While it is not the Federal Government's responsibility to be the \nsole source of legal aid funding, the Federal Government has a \nsignificant role to play in partnership with State and local \ngovernments, the legal community and other public and private sources.\n  The need and the cost effectiveness of increased funding for civil \nlegal aid have been amply demonstrated. The excuse that there is not \nenough money is no longer acceptable. We are failing to protect the \nlegal rights of too many of our most vulnerable residents.\n  But if Congress adopts the Harkin amendment reflecting the bipartisan \nLegal Services Corporation Board's funding request, it would mean \nalmost $1 million in additional funding for Illinois programs over last \nyear's appropriation and thereby ensure services for thousands of \nlower-income Illinois residents.\n  By contrast, if the appropriation remains at the $324 million level \nin the underlying bill we are considering, it will result in additional \ncuts of more than $200,000 for Illinois programs. Attorneys throughout \nIllinois already contribute more than $5 million annually to civil \nlegal aid, as well as providing hundreds of thousands of hours of pro \nbono services. While members of the legal community must continue to be \nleaders in this effort, they cannot do it alone. Congress must step up \nto the plate.\n  Access to and availability of legal services will be even more acute \nin the coming months as thousands of victims of the devastation in the \nwake of Hurricane Katrina grapple with housing, unemployment, and other \ncomplicated assistance programs. Prior to Hurricane Katrina, there was \nalready a critical need for an increase in the budget for legal \nservices programs. Between March and May of 2005, legal service \nprograms across the country were forced to turn away 50 percent of \npeople eligible for assistance. An additional 20 percent were forced to \nmake due with less legal help than necessary.\n  By adopting this very modest amendment offered by Senator Harkin, we \ncan ensure that tens of thousands more Americans like those I described \nhave access to critical legal services that will enable them to \ncontinue to be independent and productive members of our communities.\n  Senator Harkin's amendment would merely restore Legal Services \nCorporation funding to its level from 2 years ago when adjusted for \ninflation. It is only a modest increase from last year's $335 million \npre-rescission funding level, yet it would help ensure services for \ntens of thousands of Americans are protected. It will help give them \naccess to reliable web-based legal information and resources, legal aid \nhotlines, and extended representation by legal aid attorneys in more \ncomplex matters.\n  I hope we will all join in full support of Senator Harkin's \nreasonable amendment. Let's demonstrate that ``justice for all'' is a \nmeaningful commitment--and never becomes a meaningless cliche.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President. I rise in strong support of the amendment \noffered by Senator Harkin to increase funding for the Legal Services \nCorporation. I am proud to be a cosponsor of the amendment.\n  The Legal Services Corporation provides vital legal assistance to the \npoor\n\n[[Page S9782]]\n\naround the country. It was created in 1974 with bipartisan \ncongressional sponsorship and the support of the Nixon administration.\n  In Chicago, the Legal Services Corporation funds make it possible for \nthe Legal Assistance Foundation to help my constituents navigate the \nfoster care system and receive compensation after violent crimes. In \nGalesburg and Peoria, these funds make it possible for the Prairie \nState Legal Services organization to help people dealing with domestic \nviolence issues and elder abuse.\n  In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, you can bet that Legal \nServices Corporation will be in Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, and \nthe many States where hurricane victims are being relocated helping \nnewly impoverished citizens obtain food and shelter assistance, health \ncare and insurance benefits, unemployment insurance, Social Security \nbenefits, and FEMA assistance.\n  This program makes a real difference in people's lives. Take the \nstory of Irene and her family for example, who live in Section 8 \nhousing and needed help. They visited the Prairie State Legal Services \noffice in Illinois. Every day, Irene had to get two wheelchair-bound \ngrandchildren up the stairs and into a second floor apartment. Both her \ngrandchildren have cerebral palsy and are confined to wheelchairs. The \noldest is now 14 and weighs 160 lbs. And after 11 years, as I am sure \nyou can imagine, Irene was having a hard time getting her grandchildren \nup those stairs. But when she tried to make this difficult situation \nbetter, it only got worse.\n  Irene applied for and received a transfer certificate from Section 8 \nto allow her to move to a new apartment. But she could not find a \nfirst-floor apartment to transfer to within the 60 days that the \ntransfer allowed. Irene tried calling the Section 8 offices to let them \nknow of the delay, but she was forced to leave messages. When she \nfinally sent a letter asking for a response to her messages, she was \ninformed that she was too late--not only was the Public Housing Agency \nterminating her transfer, it was also terminating the Section 8 subsidy \nfor her current apartment.\n  But that is when Prairie State and Legal Services Corporation \nintervened. A staff attorney represented Irene in an administrative \nappeal, and pointed out that under the Fair Housing Act and the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act, Irene had not been provided the \nsupport needed to assist her in finding an apartment. As a result of \nher attorney's efforts, Irene's subsidy was reinstated, she was given a \nnew transfer certificate and was provided with active assistance in \nhelping her find a new apartment.\n  Legal Services Corporation helps folks like Irene all across the \ncountry, from South Carolina to South Dakota, Illinois to Iowa. And \nwhen someone displaced by Hurricane Katrina cannot afford a lawyer but \nis having trouble getting her unemployment insurance or Social Security \nbenefits, or getting her utilities turned back on, Legal Services \nCorporation will be right there. Legal Services Corporation-funded \norganizations have won dozens of awards, and groups ranging from AARP \nto the American Bar Association have voiced their strong support of \nLSC. We should do the same.\n  Over the last decade, the LSC budget has suffered $196 million in \ncuts. The Appropriations Committee proposed this year to cut $6 million \nmore. I do not think this is the time to deny legal services to those \nwho need them most. I believe that in light of the pressing crises \nconfronting individuals in the gulf coast, we should be increasing \nfunding for the Legal Services Corporation, not decreasing it. So I \nstrongly support Senator Harkin's amendment, and I urge my colleagues \nto do the same.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the amendment \nintroduced by my colleague, Senator Harkin, from Iowa, which would \nincrease funding for the Legal Services Corporation by $38.2 million to \n$363 million.\n  If there was ever a time to provide adequate funding for legal \nservices for the poor, that time is now.\n  In the wake of Hurricane Katrina, there will be thousands and \nthousands of Americans in desperate need of legal advice who lack the \nresources to hire their own attorneys or the skills necessary to meet \nthe legal challenges they must confront.\n  These are the same folks that didn't have the means to get out of \nharm's way when the hurricane struck.\n  These are the same folks that waited for days on their rooftops, at \nthe New Orleans Convention Center, the Superdome, and so many other \nplaces down on the Gulf Coast to be rescued.\n  These are the same folks that now must rebuild their lives--often \ntimes from scratch.\n  They will need legal assistance. Congress needs to step in and help \nmake this a reality. And Congress needs to step and increase funding so \nthat the thousands of other Americans--in addition to the victims of \nKatrina--who are unable to afford legal advice get the access to \njustice that they deserve.\n  How can it be, in a country where we teach our children from an early \nage the Pledge of Allegiance and its closing words--``with liberty and \njustice for all''--so many children and their families cannot obtain \nequal access to justice?\n  How can it be, in a country that saw an historic economic boom in the \nlast decade, that 80 percent of low-income Americans still lack access \nto a lawyer when they're in serious legal situations?\n  How can it be, in a country as strong and rich as this one, that tens \nof thousands of Americans who need legal representation are turned away \nevery year because their Government won't support the very program \ndesigned to help them?\n  This year, the House has appropriated only $324.5 million in funding \nfor Legal Services. The current version of the Senate CJS \nAppropriations bill funds the program at about the same level.\n  This is less than Legal Services received in FY 2005. It's almost $40 \nmillion less than the FY 2006 budget request made by the bipartisan \nLegal Services Corporation Board of Directors. In fact, the current \nlevel of funding is not much more than it was in 1981--in real dollars.\n  The issues that Legal Aid works to address are not esoteric legal \nquestions. They are issues of life and death and food and shelter.\n  When folks who are already hurting can't get the legal representation \nthey need, all too often it gets harder to put food on the table and \nharder to pay the rent and harder to get the medicine for the kids or \nfor Grandma.\n  In the State of Oregon, the need for legal aid is clear, and the \nchoice to fund it should be obvious. Oregon's Legal Aid programs are \nthe primary source of representation available to more than 500,000 \nlow-income folks in my State, and they assist 20,000 of those low-\nincome Oregonians every year.\n  But because of Legal Aid funding shortfalls in recent years, the \nOregon programs have had to layoff staff, cut salaries for remaining \nstaff, slash their medical benefits, freeze vacancies, and close the \nKlamath Falls office. Less than 20 percent of low income Oregonians \nhave access to an attorney who could make a critical difference in \nhelping them deal with a legal issue--from a getting restraining order \nfrom an abusive boyfriend to helping a predatory lending victim.\n  The idea that Legal Aid is the practice of political law is \npreposterous.\n  It's simply making sure that legal services are available for the \nvery people who need them most.\n  Make no mistake--State, local and private resources are providing the \nvast majority of Legal Aid funding in Oregon and elsewhere. In 1980, \nFederal funding accounted for 80 percent of the total legal aid money \nin Oregon. In 2005, Federal funding accounts for 28 percent. Everyone \nelse is doing their part to provide these folks with equal access to \njustice--it's time that the Federal Government did its part too.\n  I am determined that the victims of Hurricane Katrina and poor \nAmericans throughout the United States, who, as children, stood in \ntheir classrooms with their hands over their hearts and recited the \nPledge of Allegiance and the words ``with liberty and justice for all'' \nwill not find out those words were a lie.\n  I am determined that the victims of Hurricane Katrina living in the \nHouston Astrodome will have legal help they need when applying for food\n\n[[Page S9783]]\n\nstamps and other forms of assistance available to them.\n  I am determined that the victims of Hurricane Katrina relocated to \nSan Antonio will get legal help they need to deal with their insurance \ncompanies.\n  I am determined that the victims of Hurricane Katrina spread all \nacross the country will get the legal assistance they need to rebuild \ntheir homes--and their lives.\n  With Federal, State and local partners working together, we can \nensure equal access to the law for all Americans, including the \nthousands and thousands of victims of Hurricane Katrina.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator from Iowa for \noffering this amendment. I know he has been a passionate supporter of \nLegal Services and quite frankly so have I over the years, having used \nit when I was a social worker in Baltimore and a child abuse worker, I \nmight add, when many of these children had very little protection, the \nkind of protection we have now.\n  Legal Services will perform services at multiple levels. One is the \ntraditional services in all 50 States. No. 2, though, they will be very \nimportant now to people with Katrina, particularly those who are \nunfamiliar with paperwork and bureaucracy and applying and all of those \nthings and will need someone to help them navigate.\n  One might ask, why would they need a lawyer? Legal Services offers \nmore than lawyers, and they will be there. I think the Senator's \namendment is excellent. I think what we need to be able to do is find \nboth the will and the wallet to fully support Legal Services.\n  When I think back on what Legal Services has meant, it often helped \npeople get their lives together. I know in my own case as a social \nworker, it helped a welfare mother get a divorce from an abusive \nhusband. It helped her be able to clear up all of her credit issues so \nthat she could begin a new life. She got a GED so she could move off of \nwelfare and establish herself. The credit card mess was due to the \nabusive husband. So Legal Services, really, in many instances helps \nfamilies get their lives together.\n  So we look forward to supporting this amendment and working with him \non other advocacy issues.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1652\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the amendment \noffered by Senator Lincoln to ensure that victims of this terrible \nhurricane have access to the health care their situation demands today. \nThis is the least we can do, and I urge Senators to support her \namendment.\n  I was moved to hear the words of Senator Landrieu this morning. She \nhas been a tireless warrior for her State throughout her career, and I \ncommend her for her work and her efforts over the last tragic days she \nhas been through in Louisiana. To her and to my other colleagues, to \nSenator Lott, Senator Cochran, Senator Vitter, Senator Sessions, and \nSenator Shelby, I simply say we should do everything in our power as a \nSenate to help the victims of this terrible storm and to help rebuild \ntheir States, cities, and communities.\n  Let me say, too, that I am proud of Coloradans and their response to \nthis disaster. In the 10 days since the devastating storm hit the \nshores off the gulf coast, people of our State have stepped up to help \nthe victims.\n  Experts from the national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \nlaboratory in Fort Collins will be dispatched to the region soon. \nDisease trackers from Fort Collins likely will be sent to the gulf \ncoast to help contain the spread of the West Nile virus and the spread \nof other mosquito-borne illnesses in the aftermath of Hurricane \nKatrina. The U.S. Northern Command at Peterson Air Force Base, which is \ncharged with defending against military attacks within our borders, is \nnow charged with mobilizing military resources for the Hurricane \nKatrina disaster. The U.S. Joint Operations Center in Colorado Springs \nhas nearly 1,000 people on 24-hour duty to facilitate Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency requests.\n  I am proud of the men and women in uniform who today are helping our \ncountry within our borders.\n  Nearly 800 Colorado National Guard men and women are deployed to that \nregion today. Churches in Denver and throughout the State of Colorado \nare mobilizing to help with relief efforts, whether that means \ncollecting donations, physically traveling to the devastated \ncommunities, or taking in displaced refugees. The University of \nColorado has started a streamlined admissions process for students \ntemporarily displaced by Hurricane Katrina. Colorado State University \nhas taken similar steps.\n  The American Red Cross Mile High Chapter, which houses the Nation's \nsecond largest disaster response phone operation and which for a time \nwas handling one-third of the calls pouring into the Red Cross national \nheadquarters in Washington, DC, has done a tremendous job, and in the \nimmediate aftermath of the storm more than 800 Coloradans volunteered \nto receive training and field phone calls and take donations for the \nRed Cross. My wife Hope and my daughter Melinda and I visited the \nDenver operation last week and helped man the phones. I could not have \nbeen more proud of our State and its people. I am sure the experience \nof Colorado is an experience that has gone across all of our 50 States \nof our great Nation.\n  I remember Sunday, August 28, very well. The country held its \ncollective breath as we awaited landfall of Hurricane Katrina. In my \nfaith, we celebrate Feast Days of Saints, symbols of the kinds of lives \nCatholics aspire to lead. Sunday, August 28, was the Feast Day of Saint \nAugustine, an intellectual giant in our church who became so only after \nbattling great personal challenges in his own personal life. Augustine \nhad an important piece of advice for all of us that is applicable \ntoday. He said:\n\n       Pray, as though everything depended on God. Work as though \n     everything depended on you.\n\n  One look at the devastation in the gulf coast--the destruction \nwrought in Biloxi, MS, the obliteration of towns all along the \nMississippi coast, and the suffering in New Orleans and across \nLouisiana--and none of us could have imagined that kind of devastation \ncould ever occur here in our homeland. We cannot help but feel that the \nreconstruction of this wonderful part of our country will depend not \nonly on our human powers but also on the supernatural powers that will \nguide us.\n  But seeing the suffering on the faces of our fellow countrymen, \nwomen, and children, you cannot feel anything but to be ready to work \nas if the end of their suffering depends on our work. In point of fact, \nthose suffering people depend on us to end their suffering, and we owe \nit to them to work as though everything depends on us. I submit that a \nbasic function of the Federal Government is to respond to a national \ndisaster such as Katrina which has devastated 90,000 square miles of \nAmerica.\n  We can and we must do everything we can. I submit we should take on \nour challenge in three critical ways. First, we must provide immediate \nhumanitarian assistance. Second, the President should lead a Marshall-\nlike plan to reconstruct the gulf coast region. Third, we must learn \nthe lessons from the Katrina disaster so we can prevent these kinds of \ndisasters from happening elsewhere in our great Nation.\n  Let me review each of those points. First, by providing immediate \nhumanitarian aid and assistance to the victims of this terrible \ndisaster, we should be doing what is our duty as a nation. Last week, \nCongress provide FEMA $10.5 billion in emergency funding. Today, we \nanticipate we will provide\n\n[[Page S9784]]\n\nanother $51.8 billion for this national disaster. Passing these \nappropriations will help the victims of Hurricane Katrina, and it is \nthe right thing to do. I am proud we are taking these steps.\n  At the same time, the Federal Government can and should do more. That \nis why I commend Senators Reid and Landrieu for introducing the Katrina \nEmergency Relief Plan earlier today. I am proud to cosponsor that \nlegislation, and I urge my colleagues to join us in immediately passing \nthis much needed relief for the victims.\n  We can take that first step now by passing Senator Lincoln's proposed \namendment. The people of our great Nation have the right to expect and \ndeserve the best emergency and disaster response services in the world. \nIt is the responsibility of the Federal Government to protect its \ncitizens, and in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina much more needs to \nbe done to live up to that responsibility.\n  The Katrina Emergency Relief Plan is the right first step. I also \nwill continue to press for additional immediate relief, including: \nfirst, an emergency appropriation for CDC, for disease surveillance and \nmitigation; second, immediate assistance to States for those \nuniversities and school districts, such as those in Colorado, that take \non displaced students from Katrina-affected elementary, middle, high \nschools, and university settings; third, an expansion of the cap on the \namount of charitable donations that can be claimed for tax purposes \nwhen those donations are given for Hurricane Katrina responses; fourth, \na fix in the Tax Code to permit the expenses associated with the \nprovision of room and board to victims of Hurricane Katrina to be tax \ndeductible; and, finally, exempting the victims of Hurricane Katrina \nfrom the means test under the new bankruptcy law due to take effect on \nOctober 17 of this year.\n\n  Second, we must respond to this disaster by creating a Marshall plan \nfor reconstruction of the gulf coast. From jazz to William Faulkner, \nthese affected States have given much to our country and to our \nhistory. As such, I cannot imagine that anyone would not consider \ninvesting the resources necessary to rebuild this vital part of our \ngreat country. We owe it to our fellow countrymen and people on the \ngulf coast.\n  This will require a recovery and reconstruction effort on the scale \nof the Marshall plan that rebuilt Europe after World War II. Not unlike \npost-World War II Europe, the Gulf States are now facing unprecedented \ndamages which require immediate action. Entire towns in Mississippi \nwere destroyed and it will take months to make New Orleans and other \ncommunities in Louisiana habitable again.\n  Such a plan should include the creation of a small and effective \nCabinet member-chaired task force--that the President would appoint--\nwith State and local participation, and that task force would have a \nsingular focus on this challenge. The task force should develop a plan \nfor reconstruction, identify the costs associated with that plan, and \noversee its successful implementation.\n  In addition, I recommend getting our hands around the pain at the \npump created by the record high gas prices, and the impact they are \nhaving on our country, including consumers, farmers, ranchers, and \nbusinesses. A first step in that effort is for the Department of \nJustice to provide assistance, both technical and financial, to State \nattorneys general to fight price gouging and contractor fraud, and \nfreeze any requirements for small businesses and farmers affected by \nKatrina to service Small Business Administration and USDA loans or any \nother Federal Government-provided loans until the affected areas can be \nreconstructed.\n  If we are to have a Marshall plan, we also will need to have a leader \nof the caliber of General George C. Marshall. That is why I repeat \ntoday my request to the President that he seek the resignation of \nMichael Brown, the FEMA Director, and replace him with a leader who has \nthe experience and expertise to meet the challenges of the greatest \nnatural disaster in our country's history.\n  Thirdly, we must expeditiously determine what happened in response to \nthis disaster and how we should reform FEMA and our Federal agencies to \nensure that this slow response does not happen again.\n  I have already joined my colleagues in calling for an independent \ncommission to investigate the Federal response to Hurricane Katrina and \nhow we can be better prepared for future cataclysmic events. This \neffort can be helpful, and, as was the case in the wake of the terrible \n9/11 terrorist attacks, we can, in fact, do something to learn the \nlessons we must learn.\n  But what we do not need is a partisan investigation that produces \npredetermined results. Remember the history of the 9/11 Commission, the \nmost bipartisan and successful commission in a long time. It was only \nagainst the backdrop of opposition from the White House and after \nmonths of calls from the families of the victims of 9/11 that the \ncommission was created, and, once created, that commission did its job.\n  I hope we can avoid the partisan wrangling this time around and get a \ncommission that gets right to work on this very important effort.\n  I will also propose legislation to improve training for evacuation \nand relocation in reaction to natural or manmade disasters. We often \ncannot predict when natural disasters will strike, but we must begin \npreparation for future incidents without further delay.\n  I hope, too, that the conferees on the Homeland Security will keep in \nthat conference report my amendment to require a national survey of \nfirst responders. I recently conducted such a survey of Colorado's \nfirst responders and was appalled at the result which demonstrated how \nunprepared our first responders are in dealing with these kinds of \ndisasters. Given what we have seen in the last 10 days--where the \nFederal Government's response has without question failed--we need to \nhear directly from the police, firefighters, and others how we can \nimprove our response.\n  In closing, I am reminded of another saying by Saint Augustine. He \nasked:\n\n       What does love look like? It has the hands to help others. \n     It has the feet to hasten to the poor and the needy. It has \n     eyes to see misery and want. It has the ears to hear the \n     sighs and sorrows of men. That is what love looks like.\n\n  The victims of this terrible tragedy love this country, but this \ncountry has let them down. It is now time for this Senate, this \nCongress, and this President, who runs the executive branch, to get to \nwork to rectify that letdown.\n  We are this great country's hands, and we can do more to help those \nvictims. We are this great country's feet, and we can do more to carry \nassistance to those victims. We are this great country's eyes, and we \nmust see what they are suffering through. We are this great country's \nears, and we cannot turn a deaf ear to the pleas from the gulf coast.\n  We can do better, and I look forward to working with all of my \ncolleagues to ensure that we do.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of \na quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1654\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendments and call up amendment numbered 1654.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Dayton], for himself, and \n     Mr. Chambliss, Mr. Obama, Mr. Kerry, and Mr. Harkin, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 1654.\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The amendment (No. 1654) is as follows:\n\n      (Purpose: To increase funding for Justice Assistance Grants)\n\n       On page 133, line 24, strike ``$1,078,350,000'' and insert \n     ``$1,353,350,000 of which in addition to amounts provided by \n     the following table $275,000,000 shall be available for \n     Justice Assistance Grants to be offset by reducing \n     appropriations in this title by a total of $275,000,000 to \n     come from activities as follows: $43,000,000 from travel and \n     transportation of persons; $3,000,000 from transportation of \n     things; $27,000,000 from communications, utilities, and \n     miscellaneous charges;\n\n[[Page S9785]]\n\n     $6,000,000 from printing and reproduction; and $196,000,000 \n     from other services''.\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. I thank the distinguished ranking member for assistance \nin putting this together. I thank my distinguished cosponsor of this \namendment, Senator Chambliss of Georgia, for his leadership and \ninvolvement in the Byrne Grants, along with Senator Lieberman whose \nlong-time involvement in the grants has been recognized nationally.\n  It is my understanding the amendment is further cosponsored by \nSenator Obama, Senator Kerry, and Senator Harkin, and I ask unanimous \nconsent Senators Hagel, Clinton, Cantwell, and Salazar be added as \noriginal cosponsors of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, this amendment increases the funding for \nthe Juvenile Assistance Grants by $275 million, with particular focus \non adding that funding to what are called the Byrne Grants, which are \nlocal law enforcement grants vital in my State of Minnesota for \nfighting the scourge of meth that has ravaged communities, that has \nbeen so destructive to schoolchildren of all ages, I am sorry to say, \nparticularly teenagers and young adults.\n  The illegal meth used in production in Minnesota has increased in a \nskyrocketing fashion. I understand that is true in many other States as \nwell. These Byrne Grants have been essential to Minnesota and other law \nenforcement efforts to provide the funds necessary to combat the \nscourge. The funds go to local law enforcement block grants.\n  The Byrne Formula Grants consolidated into the Justice Assistance \nGrant have been reduced in the last couple of years. This restores \nbadly needed funding for those purposes. I commend the chairman of the \nsubcommittee and the ranking member for providing $625 million of \nfunding that is well above what the House of Representatives has \nprovided, $348 million.\n  This money is desperately needed and will be well used. My amendment \nis fully offset by various reductions in administrative expenses. I can \ndetail those if Members desire, but it will be fully offset, and has \nbeen determined as such by the Congressional Budget Office.\n  I ask unanimous consent, at the conclusion of my remarks, the \nfollowing letters of endorsement from the national organizations be \nadded: The National Association of Police Officers, the International \nAssociation of Chiefs of Police, the Minnesota Sheriff's Association, \nthe Minnesota Police and Peace Officers Association.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1).\n  Mr. DAYTON. I ask my colleagues to support this bipartisan effort. I \nbelieve they will find, as I have, this has almost unanimous support of \nlocal law enforcement officials in their States, as it does in mine. \nThe funding is desperately needed, and it will be well used and go to \nour communities, to our counties, to our States in ways that will be \ndirectly involved in reducing juvenile crime as well as other forms of \ncrime.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                          The National Association\n\n\n                                           of Police Officers,\n\n                                                September 8, 2005.\n     Re Dayton Amendment re JAG funding.\n\n     Office of Senator Dayton,\n     Washington, DC.\n       NAPO supports Senator Dayton's amendment to increase JAG \n     funding by $275 million. The Justice Assistance Grants have \n     provided beneficial support for local law enforcement, \n     fostered community initiatives against crime and facilitated \n     improvements to State criminal justice systems. We thank the \n     Senator for his continued work to ensure that local law \n     enforcement is afforded the ability to receive the effective \n     and user-friendly funds it Deeds the most.\n       Please keep me posted on how the amendment fares today.\n           Thank you.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         International Association\n\n\n                                          of Chiefs of Police,\n\n                                                September 6, 2005.\n     Hon. Mark Dayton,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dayton: On behalf of the International \n     Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP), I am writing to \n     express our support for your amendment to restore funding to \n     the Justice Accountability Grant (JAG) program. As you know, \n     the IACP is the world's oldest and largest association of law \n     enforcement executives with more than 20,000 members in 100 \n     countries.\n       The JAG program, which was formed by consolidating the \n     Edward Byrne Memorial Grant program and the Local Law \n     Enforcement Block Grant program, is one of the primary \n     federal assistance programs for state, tribal and local law \n     enforcement agencies. For more than a decade, the resources \n     provided under the JAG program have allowed law enforcement \n     agencies to expand their capabilities and make great strides \n     in reducing the incidence of crime in communities across the \n     nation. The JAG program provides crucial funding to assist \n     states, tribes and local governments in controlling and \n     preventing drug abuse, crime and violence, and in improving \n     the functioning of the criminal justice system.\n       However, this vital program has seen significant cuts in \n     recent years. H.R. 2862 as currently drafted in the Senate \n     would provide $625 million, a cut of $275 million or 30 \n     percent, from FY 2003 levels. Cuts of this magnitude will \n     certainly have a significant and negative impact on the \n     ability of state, tribal and local law enforcement agencies \n     to maintain the many critical anti-crime programs that are \n     currently supported by funds received under the JAG program.\n       It is vital that Congress act to ensure that state, tribal \n     and local law enforcement agencies continue to receive the \n     resources necessary to fulfill their mission of protecting \n     the public and the communities they serve. For these reasons, \n     the IACP urges all Members of Congress to support your \n     efforts to restore funding to the JAG program to FY 2003 \n     levels.\n       Thank you for your efforts on behalf of law enforcement.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Gene R. Voegtlin,\n     Legislative Counsel.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               Minnesota Sheriffs Association,\n\n                                                September 7, 2005.\n       Dear Senator Mark Dayton: The Sheriffs of Minnesota are \n     asking for your support and leadership in restoring funding \n     for the Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) program, including the \n     Byrne Grant Program and LLEBG. It is my understanding you are \n     considering an amendment that would add $275M to JAG which \n     would increase funding to 2003 level of funding.\n       Under the Administration's current proposal funding for \n     several of these crime fighting programs are significantly \n     decreased or eliminated altogether. The Minnesota Sheriffs \n     Association is requesting your support in restoring funding \n     for the Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant and COPS \n     programs. In Minnesota the Byrne Grant program is critical to \n     the success of our Gang and Drug Task Force operations. \n     During our Minnesota 2005 Legislative session, our \n     legislature appropriated local funds to match the Byrne Grant \n     funds. The coordination of these funds will give our law \n     enforcement officers the resources and necessary support as \n     they battle both increased gang activity and massive increase \n     in meth addiction and use within our state. Example: in a \n     recent sample survey at several of our county jails it was \n     revealed over 53% of our prisoners are in jail due to meth/\n     drug related charges. Without the Byrne Grant funding, local \n     crime fighting resources will have to be reduced.\n       Please do what you can to restore the Byrne Grant funding. \n     This is a very important source of federal funding for our \n     Sheriffs and local units of government. Thank you for your \n     consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                James D. Franklin,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              Minnesota Police and\n\n\n                                   Peace Officers Association,\n\n                                                September 8, 2005.\n     Hon. Senator Mark Dayton,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dayton: I write today to thank you and commend \n     your efforts to ensure continued and critically needed \n     funding for the Byrne Justice Assistance Program. I wish to \n     express the strong support of police officers across the \n     state and the 7,500 members of the Minnesota Police and Peace \n     Officers Association (MPPOA), for the Dayton-Chambliss \n     amendment to the FY 2006 Commerce, Justice, Science \n     Appropriations Bill (H.R. 2862) to enhance funds provided for \n     this critically important program.\n       In Minnesota and other states across the country, the Byrne \n     Justice Assistance Program is a significant source of support \n     for education, treatment, and law enforcement initiatives \n     combating the scourge of methamphetamine. As you know, \n     methamphetamine is a serious and still growing problem in \n     Minnesota, and it continues to spread throughout the nation. \n     Exposure to methamphetamme and the waste and by-products from \n     its production poses significant risks and has devastating \n     consequences--for individuals, children, communities, and \n     emergency services personnel. Indeed, nearly every day a \n     tragic story is reported in the Minnesota news media telling \n     of the devastating effect of methamphetamine on our \n     residents, our families, and our communities.\n       As President of Minnesota Police and Peace Officers \n     Association (MPPOA), I have witnessed first hand the benefits \n     of the Byrne Program in protecting our communities and \n     families from the growing problem of methamphetamine. In \n     Minnesota, the Byrne Justice Assistance Program funds\n\n[[Page S9786]]\n\n     local drug education treatment, and law enforcement programs, \n     including 21 multi-jurisdictional drug task forces that are \n     tasked with combating the epidemic of methamphetamine \n     trafficking and production in our communities. Without the \n     support of the Byrne Justice Assistance Program funding, \n     these drug task forces face reductions that will decrease \n     their abilities and effectiveness. Should this occur, \n     Minnesota's ability to fight the war on drugs would \n     undoubtedly be diminished, with potentially disastrous \n     consequences. I have attached a recent article from the \n     Fergus Falls (MN) Daily Herald which illustrates the \n     importance of the drug task forces and the potential \n     consequences of reductions in available resources.\n       The concerns of Minnesota law enforcement officers are not \n     limited to the borders of the state--methamphetamine \n     ``cooks'' often obtain the necessary ingredients in \n     surrounding states and manufacture the drug locally. In \n     addition, the international and interstate trafficking of \n     methamphetamine is increasing as the drug task forces succeed \n     in their efforts to identify, arrest, and prosecute domestic \n     clandestine methamphetamine laboratory operators. These \n     challenges exhibit the need for a strong federal response to \n     methamphetamine, an effort that, in many areas, depends on \n     the support of the Byrne Justice Assistance Grant Program.\n       Once again Senator Dayton, thank you for your continued \n     support of Minnesota's law enforcement community and your \n     efforts to ensure adequate resources in the national fight \n     against methamphetamine.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Bob Bushman,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senator Dayton and \nSenator Chambliss's amendment. In the wake of the devastation of \nHurricane Katrina and the massive displacement of hundreds of thousands \nof people, the country has once again relied on the strong efforts of \nthe Nation's first responders to provide aid during a time of national \ntragedy.\n  Although the Federal response to this disaster may have been too \nslow, there can be no doubt that the men and women on the nation's \nfront lines have valiantly come to the aid of their fellow citizens.\n  Police officers from New York City, NY, to Alton, IL, have answered \nthe call of duty and volunteered to go to New Orleans to assist in \nrescue, recovery, and reconstruction efforts. These brave men and women \nare the Nation's heroes, and this body should do all it can to provide \nthem with the resources they need to do their jobs.\n  Unfortunately, at a time when we are relying on the Nation's first \nresponders--our law enforcement, our fire fighters, our emergency \ntechnicians--to protect us against terrorism, to respond to natural \ndisasters, to protect us from the normal everyday ravages of crime and \ndrug use that do not abate just because the Nation is at war--it is \nshocking to me that Washington is contemplating major cuts to important \nlaw enforcement assistance programs.\n  That is why I am proud to be joining Senators Dayton and Chambliss in \ncosponsoring an amendment to the Commerce, Justice, Science \nappropriations bill to increase funding for the Edward Byrne Memorial \nJustice Assistance Grant Program.\n  The Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program, provides \nan important source of funding for state and local law enforcement to \nmake communities safer and improve criminal justice.\n  In Illinois, these dollars are put to good use. They help fight the \nscourge of methamphetamine, which has traveled from the West Coast to \nthe Midwest and is ruining rural communities across the country.\n  The meth problem has grown exponentially in the last few years. \nPolice in Illinois encountered 971 meth labs in 2003--more than double \nthe number seen in the year 2000. The quantity of meth seized by the \nIllinois State Police increased nearly ten-fold between 1997 and 2003.\n  The meth problem is taking over communities--depleting already \nlimited resources, taxing the police, the judicial system, social \nservices, and the schools. Every aspect of the local communities are \ntouched and harmed by meth.\n  Luckily, one program has proven helpful in Illinois' battle against \nmeth--the Byrne Justice Assistance Grant Program.\n  In 2004 alone, Byrne Justice Assistance Grant dollars helped make \n1,267 methamphetamine drug arrests in Illinois. That same year, Byrne \nJustice Assistance Grant dollars helped seize 348,923 grams of \nmethamphetamine.\n  For rural Illinois, Justice Assistance Grant dollars have provided a \nmuch-needed life raft, funding important multi-jurisdictional programs \nthat have allowed various counties and communities to join together, \ncombine resources and work to stop the onslaught of meth.\n  The Southern Illinois Enforcement Group--a coalition of three \nSouthern, predominantly rural Illinois counties, is one of these task \nforces. The unit has responded to 84 meth labs so far this year, more \nthan 40 percent of all meth labs in the greater Southern Illinois 33-\ncounty region for 2005.\n  When I visited with law enforcement from the Metropolitan Enforcement \nGroup of Southwestern Illinois, another one of these task forces, this \nAugust, they shared with me how important these dollars are to their \nefforts. They fear that any cuts will mean a reduction in the number of \nofficers, or even worse, the loss of the task force, either of which \nwill mean that they will have to battle a growing meth problem with \nfewer resources. Now, this body is proposing to flatfund the Byrne \nGrant Program at $625 million.\n  While this is much better than the alternative proposed by the \nPresident--who wanted to eliminate the program--and it is better than \nthe House option, which has voted to fund the Justice Assistance Grant \nProgram at $366.4 million--this is woefully short of the funding \nprovided this program only 3 years ago.\n  The amendment I cosponsor today would fund the Justice Assistance \nGrant program at $900 million, the same amount provided the Byrne \nFormula Grants and the Local Law Enforcement Block Grants, which \ncomprise the Justice Assistance Grant program in fiscal year 2003.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me and Senators Dayton and Chambliss \nin supporting our Nation's law enforcement--and giving them the \nresources they need to do their jobs.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be permitted to \nspeak for up to 10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            USA PATRIOT ACT\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, we are all very busily working on \nappropriations bills, and we are working in committees as individuals \nand leaders on the terrible tragedy of Hurricane Katrina, and our \nhearts and our thoughts and prayers go out to all the victims. We know \na tremendous amount of work needs to be done, and we are just beginning \nto see how big it is and how difficult it is going to be. Certainly, \nthe distinguished manager of the bill knows in his own State how \nterrible this crisis is.\n  But I believe it is important to issue a cautionary message that as \nwe approach the anniversary of 9/11, we cannot lose sight of the fact \nthat we are still at war and under attack by those who want to end our \nway of life and destroy our civilization and terrorize our citizens.\n  I have been asking myself: Are we safe from another terrorist attack \non the scale of 9/11? Is the Government doing everything it can to \nprotect us? What can we do better? We have heard recently some very \nominous warnings from leaders of al-Qaida that they are preparing \nanother terrorist attack. Obviously, we have to maintain the \nappropriate means of defense, and we\n\n[[Page S9787]]\n\nhave done a good job of making it more difficult for terrorists to \nstrike commercial airlines, but we also know, from having seen the \nattacks in London in July, that terrorists are looking for soft \ntargets.\n  It is not enough to protect what we know they have attacked in the \npast. We have to do a better job. I think President Bush was right in \nsaying the best way we can keep our country safe is to carry the war on \nterror to those countries that harbor terrorists.\n  I heard some discussion recently about whether we should have gone \ninto Iraq. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record an article by Christopher Hitchens in last week's Weekly \nStandard that lays out in detail, for anybody who is interested, why we \nhad to go into Iraq, why it is the right war. I would incorporate that \nby reference because that article does a good job of outlining my own \nbeliefs.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Weekly Standard, Sept. 5-12, 2005]\n\n      A War to Be Proud of: The Case for Overthrowing Saddam Was \n      Unimpeachable. Why, Then, Is the Administration Tongue-Tied?\n\n                       (By Christopher Hitchens)\n\n       Let me begin with a simple sentence that, even as I write \n     it, appears less than Swiftian in the modesty of its \n     proposal: ``Prison conditions at Abu Ghraib have improved \n     markedly and dramatically since the arrival of Coalition \n     troops in Baghdad.''\n       I could undertake to defend that statement against any \n     member of Human Rights Watch or Amnesty International, and I \n     know in advance that none of them could challenge it, let \n     alone negate it. Before March 2003, Abu Ghraib was an \n     abattoir, a torture chamber, and a concentration camp. Now, \n     and not without reason, it is an international byword for \n     Yankee imperialism and sadism. Yet the improvement is still, \n     unarguably, the difference between night and day. How is it \n     possible that the advocates of a post Saddam Iraq have been \n     placed on the defensive in this manner? And where should one \n     begin?\n       I once tried to calculate how long the post-Cold War \n     liberal Utopia had actually lasted. Whether you chose to date \n     its inception from the fall of the Berlin Wall in November \n     1989, or the death of Nicolae Ceausescu in late December of \n     the same year, or the release of Nelson Mandela from prison, \n     or the referendum defeat suffered by Augusto Pinochet (or \n     indeed from the publication of Francis Fukuyama's book about \n     the ``end of history'' and the unarguable triumph of market \n     liberal pluralism), it was an epoch that in retrospect was \n     over before it began. By the middle of 1990, Saddam Hussein \n     had abolished Kuwait and Slobodan Milosevic was attempting to \n     erase the identity and the existence of Bosnia. It turned out \n     that we had not by any means escaped the reach of atavistic, \n     aggressive, expansionist, and totalitarian ideology. Proving \n     the same point in another way, and within approximately the \n     same period, the theocratic dictator of Iran had publicly \n     claimed the right to offer money in his own name for the \n     suborning of the murder of a novelist living in London, and \n     the genocidaire faction in Rwanda had decided that it could \n     probably get away with putting its long-fantasized plan of \n     mass murder into operation.\n       One is not mentioning these apparently discrepant crimes \n     and nightmares as a random or unsorted list.\n       Khomeini, for example, was attempting to compensate for the \n     humiliation of the peace agreement he had been compelled to \n     sign with Saddam Hussein. And Saddam Hussein needed to make \n     up the loss, of prestige and income, that he had himself \n     suffered in the very same war. Milosevic (anticipating Putin, \n     as it now seems to me, and perhaps Beijing also) was riding a \n     mutation of socialist nationalism into national socialism. It \n     was to be noticed in all cases that the aggressors, whether \n     they were killing Muslims, or exalting Islam, or just killing \n     their neighbors, shared a deep and abiding hatred of the \n     United States.\n       The balance sheet of the Iraq war, if it is to be seriously \n     drawn up, must also involve a confrontation with at least \n     this much of recent history. Was the Bush administration \n     right to leave--actually to confirm--Saddam Hussein in power \n     after his eviction from Kuwait in 1991? Was James Baker \n     correct to say, in his delightfully folksy manner, that the \n     United States did not ``have a dog in the fight'' that \n     involved ethnic cleansing for the mad dream of a Greater \n     Serbia? Was the Clinton administration prudent in its retreat \n     from Somalia, or wise in its opposition to the U.N. \n     resolution that called for a preemptive strengthening of the \n     U.N. forces in Rwanda?\n       I know hardly anybody who comes out of this examination \n     with complete credit. There were neoconservatives who jeered \n     at Rushdie in 1989 and who couldn't see the point when \n     Sarajevo faced obliteration in 1992. There were leftist \n     humanitarians and radicals who rallied to Rushdie and called \n     for solidarity with Bosnia, but who--perhaps because of a bad \n     conscience about Palestine--couldn't face a confrontation \n     with Saddam Hussein even when he annexed a neighbor state \n     that was a full member of the Arab League and of the U.N. (I \n     suppose I have to admit that I was for a time a member of \n     that second group.) But there were consistencies, too. French \n     statecraft, for example, was uniformly hostile to any \n     resistance to any aggression, and Paris even sent troops to \n     rescue its filthy clientele in Rwanda. And some on the hard \n     left and the brute right were also opposed to any exercise, \n     for any reason, of American military force.\n       The only speech by any statesman that can bear reprinting \n     from that low, dishonest decade came from Tony Blair when he \n     spoke in Chicago in 1999. Welcoming the defeat and overthrow \n     of Milosevic after the Kosovo intervention, he warned against \n     any self-satisfaction and drew attention to an inescapable \n     confrontation that was coming with Saddam Hussein. So far \n     from being an American ``poodle,'' as his taunting and \n     ignorant foes like to sneer, Blair had in fact leaned on \n     Clinton over Kosovo and was insisting on the importance of \n     Iraq while George Bush was still an isolationist governor of \n     Texas.\n       Notwithstanding this prescience and principle on his part, \n     one still cannot read the journals of the 2000/2001 \n     millennium without the feeling that one is revisiting a \n     hopelessly somnambulist relative in a neglected home. I am \n     one of those who believe, uncynically, that Osama bin Laden \n     did us all a service (and holy war a great disservice) by his \n     mad decision to assault the American homeland four years ago. \n     Had he not made this world-historical mistake, we would have \n     been able to add a Talibanized and nuclear-armed Pakistan to \n     our list of the threats we failed to recognize in time. (This \n     threat still exists, but it is no longer so casually \n     overlooked.)\n       The subsequent liberation of Pakistan's theocratic colony \n     in Afghanistan, and the so-far decisive eviction and defeat \n     of its bin Ladenist guests, was only a reprisal. It took care \n     of the last attack. But what about the next one? For anyone \n     with eyes to see, there was only one other state that \n     combined the latent and the blatant definitions of both \n     ``rogue'' and ``failed.'' This state--Saddam's ruined and \n     tortured and collapsing Iraq--had also met all the conditions \n     under which a country may be deemed to have sacrificed its \n     own legal sovereignty. To recapitulate: It had invaded its \n     neighbors, committed genocide on its own soil, harbored and \n     nurtured international thugs and killers, and flouted \n     every provision of the Non-Proliferation Treaty. The \n     United Nations, in this crisis, faced with regular insult \n     to its own resolutions and its own character, had managed \n     to set up a system of sanctions-based mutual corruption. \n     In May 2003, had things gone on as they had been going, \n     Saddam Hussein would have been due to fill Iraq's slot as \n     chair of the U.N. Conference on Disarmament. Meanwhile, \n     every species of gangster from the hero of the Achille \n     Lauro hijacking to Abu Musab al Zarqawi was finding \n     hospitality under Saddam's crumbling roof.\n       One might have thought, therefore, that Bush and Blair's \n     decision to put an end at last to this intolerable state of \n     affairs would be hailed, not just as a belated vindication of \n     long-ignored U.N. resolutions but as some corrective to the \n     decade of shame and inaction that had just passed in Bosnia \n     and Rwanda. But such is not the case. An apparent consensus \n     exists, among millions of people in Europe and America, that \n     the whole operation for the demilitarization of Iraq, and the \n     salvage of its traumatized society, was at best a false \n     pretense and at worst an unprovoked aggression. How can this \n     possibly be?\n       There is, first, the problem of humorless and pseudo-\n     legalistic literalism. In Saki's short story The Lumber Room, \n     the naughty but clever child Nicholas, who has actually \n     placed a frog in his morning bread-and-milk, rejoices in his \n     triumph over the adults who don't credit this excuse for not \n     eating his healthful dish:\n       ``You said there couldn't possibly be a frog in my bread-\n     and-milk; there was a frog in my bread-and-milk,'' he \n     repeated, with the insistence of a skilled tactician who does \n     not intend to shift from favorable ground.\n       Childishness is one thing--those of us who grew up on this \n     wonderful Edwardian author were always happy to see the \n     grown-ups and governesses discomfited. But puerility in \n     adults is quite another thing, and considerably less \n     charming. ``You said there were WMDs in Iraq and that Saddam \n     had friends in al Qaeda. . . . Blah, blah, pants on fire.'' I \n     have had many opportunities to tire of this mantra. It takes \n     ten seconds to intone the said mantra. It would take me, on \n     my most eloquent C-SPAN day, at the very least five minutes \n     to say that Abdul Rahman Yasin, who mixed the chemicals for \n     the World Trade Center attack in 1993, subsequently sought \n     and found refuge in Baghdad; that Dr. Mahdi Obeidi, Saddam's \n     senior physicist, was able to lead American soldiers to \n     nuclear centrifuge parts and a blueprint for a complete \n     centrifuge (the crown jewel of nuclear physics) buried on the \n     orders of Qusay Hussein; that Saddam's agents were in \n     Damascus as late as February 2003, negotiating to purchase \n     missiles off the shelf from North Korea; or that Rolf Ekeus, \n     the great Swedish socialist who founded the inspection \n     process in Iraq after 1991, has told me for the record that \n     he was offered a $2 million bribe in a face-to face meeting \n     with Tariq Aziz. And these eye-catching examples would by no \n     means exhaust my repertoire, or empty my quiver. Yes, it must \n     be admitted that Bush and Blair made a hash of a good case, \n     largely because they preferred to scare people rather\n\n[[Page S9788]]\n\n     than enlighten them or reason with them. Still, the only real \n     strategy of deception has come from those who believe, or \n     pretend, that Saddam Hussein was no problem.\n       I have a ready answer to those who accuse me of being an \n     agent and tool of the Bush-Cheney administration (which is \n     the nicest thing that my enemies can find to say). Attempting \n     a little levity, I respond that I could stay at home if the \n     authorities could bother to make their own case, but that I \n     meanwhile am a prisoner of what I actually do know about the \n     permanent hell, and the permanent threat, of the Saddam \n     regime. However, having debated almost all of the \n     spokespeople for the antiwar faction, both the sane and the \n     deranged, I was recently asked a question that I was \n     temporarily unable to answer. ``If what you claim is true,'' \n     the honest citizen at this meeting politely asked me, \n     ``how come the White House hasn't told us?''\n       I do in fact know the answer to this question. So deep and \n     bitter is the split within official Washington, most \n     especially between the Defense Department and the CIA, that \n     any claim made by the former has been undermined by leaks \n     from the latter. (The latter being those who maintained, with \n     a combination of dogmatism and cowardice not seen since \n     Lincoln had to fire General McClellan, that Saddam Hussein \n     was both a ``secular'' actor and--this is the really rich \n     bit--a rational and calculating one.)\n       There's no cure for that illusion, but the resulting \n     bureaucratic chaos and unease has cornered the president into \n     his current fallback upon platitude and hollowness. It has \n     also induced him to give hostages to fortune. The claim that \n     if we fight fundamentalism ``over there'' we won't have to \n     confront it ``over here'' is not just a standing invitation \n     for disproof by the next suicide-maniac in London or Chicago, \n     but a coded appeal to provincial and isolationist opinion in \n     the United States. Surely the elementary lesson of the grim \n     anniversary that will shortly be upon us is that American \n     civilians are as near to the front line as American soldiers.\n       It is exactly this point that makes nonsense of the sob-\n     sister tripe pumped out by the Cindy Sheehan circus and its \n     surrogates. But in reply, why bother to call a struggle \n     ``global'' if you then try to localize it? Just say plainly \n     that we shall fight them everywhere they show themselves, and \n     fight them on principle as well as in practice, and get ready \n     to warn people that Nigeria is very probably the next target \n     of the jihadists. The peaceniks love to ask: When and where \n     will it all end? The answer is easy: It will end with the \n     surrender or defeat of one of the contending parties. Should \n     I add that I am certain which party that ought to be? Defeat \n     is just about imaginable, though the mathematics and the \n     algebra tell heavily against the holy warriors. Surrender to \n     such a foe, after only four years of combat, is not even \n     worthy of consideration.\n       Antaeus was able to draw strength from the earth every time \n     an antagonist wrestled him to the ground. A reverse mythology \n     has been permitted to take hold in the present case, where \n     bad news is deemed to be bad news only for regime-change. \n     Anyone with the smallest knowledge of Iraq knows that its \n     society and infrastructure and institutions have been \n     appallingly maimed and beggared by three decades of war and \n     fascism (and the ``divide-and-rule'' tactics by which Saddam \n     maintained his own tribal minority of the Sunni minority in \n     power). In logic and morality, one must therefore compare the \n     current state of the country with the likely or probable \n     state of it had Saddam and his sons been allowed to go on \n     ruling.\n       At once, one sees that all the alternatives would have been \n     infinitely worse, and would most likely have led to an \n     implosion--as well as opportunistic invasions from Iran and \n     Turkey and Saudi Arabia, on behalf of their respective \n     interests or confessional clienteles. This would in turn have \n     necessitated a more costly and bloody intervention by some \n     kind of coalition, much too late and on even worse terms and \n     conditions. This is the lesson of Bosnia and Rwanda \n     yesterday, and of Darfur today. When I have made this point \n     in public, I have never had anyone offer an answer to it. A \n     broken Iraq was in our future no matter what, and was a \n     responsibility (somewhat conditioned by our past blunders) \n     that no decent person could shirk. The only unthinkable \n     policy was one of abstention.\n       Two pieces of good fortune still attend those of us who go \n     out on the road for this urgent and worthy cause. The first \n     is contingent: There are an astounding number of plain frauds \n     and charlatans (to phrase it at is highest) in charge of the \n     propaganda of the other side. Just to tell off the names is \n     to frighten children more than Saki ever could: Michael \n     Moore, George Galloway, Jacques Chirac, Tim Robbins, Richard \n     Clarke, Joseph Wilson . . . a roster of gargoyles that \n     would send Ripley himself into early retirement. Some of \n     these characters are flippant, and make heavy jokes about \n     Halliburton, and some disdain to conceal their sympathy \n     for the opposite side. So that's easy enough.\n       The second bit of luck is a certain fiber displayed by a \n     huge number of anonymous Americans. Faced with a constant \n     drizzle of bad news and purposely demoralizing commentary, \n     millions of people stick out their jaws and hang tight. I am \n     no fan of populism, but I surmise that these citizens are \n     clear on the main point: It is out of the question--plainly \n     and absolutely out of the question--that we should surrender \n     the keystone state of the Middle East to a rotten, murderous \n     alliance between Baathists and bin Ladenists. When they hear \n     the fatuous insinuation that this alliance has only been \n     created by the resistance to it, voters know in their \n     intestines that those who say so are soft on crime and soft \n     on fascism. The more temperate anti-warriors, such as Mark \n     Danner and Harold Meyerson, like to employ the term ``a war \n     of choice.'' One should have no problem in accepting this \n     concept. As they cannot and do not deny, there was going to \n     be another round with Saddam Hussein no matter what. To whom, \n     then, should the ``choice'' of time and place have fallen? \n     The clear implication of the antichoice faction--if I may so \n     dub them--is that this decision should have been left up to \n     Saddam Hussein. As so often before.\n       Does the President deserve the benefit of the reserve of \n     fortitude that I just mentioned? Only just, if at all. We \n     need not argue about the failures and the mistakes and even \n     the crimes, because these in some ways argue themselves. But \n     a positive accounting could be offered without braggartry, \n     and would include:\n       (1) The overthrow of Talibanism and Baathism, and the \n     exposure of many highly suggestive links between the two \n     elements of this Hitler-Stalin pact. Abu Musab al Zarqawi, \n     who moved from Afghanistan to Iraq before the coalition \n     intervention, has even gone to the trouble of naming his \n     organization al Qaeda in Mesopotamia.\n       (2) The subsequent capitulation of Qaddafi's Libya in point \n     of weapons of mass destruction--a capitulation that was \n     offered not to Kofi Annan or the E.U. but to Blair and Bush.\n       (3) The consequent unmasking of the A.Q. Khan network for \n     the illicit transfer of nuclear technology to Libya, Iran, \n     and North Korea.\n       (4) The agreement by the United Nations that its own reform \n     is necessary and overdue, and the unmasking of a quasi-\n     criminal network within its elite.\n       (5) The craven admission by President Chirac and Chancellor \n     Schroder, when confronted with irrefutable evidence of \n     cheating and concealment, respecting solemn treaties, on the \n     part of Iran, that not even this will alter their commitment \n     to neutralism. (One had already suspected as much in the \n     Iraqi case. )\n       (6) The ability to certify Iraq as actually disarmed, \n     rather than accept the word of a psychopathic autocrat.\n       (7) The immense gains made by the largest stateless \n     minority in the region--the Kurds--and the spread of this \n     example to other states.\n       (8) The related encouragement of democratic and civil \n     society movements in Egypt, Syria, and most notably Lebanon, \n     which has regained a version of its autonomy.\n       (9) The violent and ignominious death of thousands of bin \n     Ladenist infiltrators into Iraq and Afghanistan, and the real \n     prospect of greatly enlarging this number.\n       (10) The training and hardening of many thousands of \n     American servicemen and women in a battle against the forces \n     of nihilism and absolutism, which training and hardening will \n     surely be of great use in future combat.\n       It would be admirable if the president could manage to make \n     such a presentation. It would also be welcome if he and his \n     deputies adopted a clear attitude toward the war within the \n     war: in other words, stated plainly, that the secular and \n     pluralist forces within Afghan and Iraqi society, while they \n     are not our clients, can in no circumstance be allowed to \n     wonder which outcome we favor.\n       The great point about Blair's 1999 speech was that it \n     asserted the obvious. Coexistence with aggressive regimes or \n     expansionist, theocratic, and totalitarian ideologies is not \n     in fact possible. One should welcome this conclusion for the \n     additional reason that such coexistence is not desirable, \n     either. If the great effort to remake Iraq as a demilitarized \n     federal and secular democracy should fail or be defeated, I \n     shall lose sleep for the rest of my life in reproaching \n     myself for doing too little. But at least I shall have the \n     comfort of not having offered, so far as I can recall, any \n     word or deed that contributed to a defeat.\n\n  Mr. BOND. But more important, we cannot just play defense against the \nterrorists. We have to collect more and better information. We have to \nget information on the location and activities of the next attack that \nis being planned. Unless we do a good job of that, we cannot have a \ngood chance of stopping the next major terrorist attack on the United \nStates.\n  I believe one part of that vital solution is found in a robust USA \nPATRIOT Act that would continue to provide national security \ninvestigators with the tools needed to continue to keep our country \nsafe.\n  The PATRIOT Act has been the subject of national controversy and has \nundergone many unsubstantiated attacks by its opponents. But the fact \nis that the PATRIOT Act saved lives, and its original content must be \npreserved. We need to continue to focus on making sure we have the \nintelligence and the investigative resources necessary to protect \nagainst further attacks. We not only need to make permanent the \nprovisions that are already in law, but we also must modify the current \nHouse\n\n[[Page S9789]]\n\nversion to include expanded authorities needed by national security \ninvestigators.\n  The men and women who are fighting the war on terror every day here \nat home say that without the PATRIOT Act, many of our Nation's most \nimportant successes would not have been possible. It addressed critical \nvulnerabilities in the pre-9/11 homeland defense posture. For example, \nit allowed national security investigators, pending a court's approval, \nto obtain and use a multiple wiretap to track a suspect's phone \ncommunications, even when a terrorist switches, changes, or abandons \nphones to avoid detection, a common terrorist tactic.\n  Specifically, according to senior law enforcement officials, during \nthe summer of 2002, the act allowed our Nation's law enforcement \nintelligence communities to break up the Portland Seven terrorist cell. \nMembers of that cell had traveled to Afghanistan in 2001 and 2002 to \njoin the Taliban and al-Qaida against the United States.\n  In 2004, the act was used to protect the El Paso Islamic Center. When \nJared Bjarnason sent an e-mail threatening to burn the center to the \nground if hostages in Iraq were not freed, the FBI used provisions of \nthe PATRIOT Act to identify him as the source of the threat. Without \nthe provisions in that act, it would have taken 30 days to obtain a \nstring of needed search warrants, while the threat of attack was only 3 \ndays away.\n  Why is it that we need to make permanent several of the acts's \nprovisions? Why do we need to modify proposed legislation to enhance \nfurther the ability of our Nation's law enforcement authorities? Some \nmay argue: If it ain't broke, then don't fix it. But I am a show-me \nMissourian, and I can tell you that making permanent these provisions \nis very important.\n  Terrorism is the operative challenge we face. Over the last 4 years \nsince 9/11, we have seen terrorism and specifically violent Sunni \nextremists waging war against us and our allies, led and inspired by \nOsama bin Laden and his lieutenant Ayman Al-Zawahiri. They are not a \nstatic, monolithic, or predictable enemy. They do not have a country. \nThey are not identifiable as a nation or a state. They are a \ncombination of stateless hierarchical and formalistic structures, \nequally lethal and fragmented. Because of the traits in the cultural \nand religious complexities, they are not predictable, quantifiable, or \nvulnerable to penetration. We have seen this in the Intelligence \nCommittee, and we know that there is a great danger out there that we \nmust continue to work to avoid.\n  These groups are highly organized and disciplined. They are inspired \nby bin Laden and Ayman Al-Zawahiri. They have been led, trained, and \nfunded by graduates of al-Qaida training centers. Our enemy is \ndetermined to win. It is committed to victory. We cannot afford just to \nbe hopeful.\n  As CIA Director James Woolsey once said: It is as if we were fighting \nwith the dragon for some 45 years, slew the dragon, and then found \nourselves in a jungle of poisonous snakes. The snakes are a lot harder \nto keep track of than the dragon ever was.\n  The PATRIOT Act is designed to be preventive. We know that the \nterrorists want to bleed us. Unfortunately, we have seen the blasphemy \nof Osama bin Laden taking the God of Abraham and claiming:\n\n       Allah willing, and nothing is too great for Allah.\n\n  This videotape was just released. And more recently his deputy, Ayman \nAl-Zawahiri, released a message saying:\n\n       The land and interests of the countries which took part in \n     the aggression against Palestine, Iraq, and Afghanistan are \n     targets for us. If you continue your politics against \n     Muslims, you will see, God willing, such horror that you will \n     forget the horrors of Vietnam.\n\n  This is the same kind of challenge and the same kind of threat we saw \nbefore 9/11. This, I am saying, requires us to be even more attuned and \nprepared for a potential terrorist attack.\n  I also note that in the recent BRAC proposals, we have gotten rid of \nmany of the Air National Guard's air national defense missions. On 9/\n11, the Air National Guard flew 90 percent of the first 400 combat air \npatrols after the first 24 hours of the attack. We need to rethink our \ndismemberment of those critical assets.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their indulgence. We are \nstill facing a danger that we cannot overlook as we deal with the very \nreal and certain tragedies of Katrina. I hope we will be able to \ncontinue our efforts to make sure that our law enforcement and \nintelligence agencies have the kind of resources they need to root out, \nto ferret out, to discover and, we hope, to defend against future \nterrorist attacks.\n  I thank the Chair and my colleagues, the managers of the bill. I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican whip.\n\n\n                  Senate Response to Hurricane Katrina\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, in times of catastrophe, when \ndestruction, suffering, and death are so overwhelming that it breaks \nyour heart and almost leaves you numb, it is comforting to find that an \noutpouring of generosity, kindness, and help from our fellow man \nrestores our faith and strengthens our souls.\n  With all the destruction wrought by Hurricane Katrina, we see more \nand more acts of extraordinary generosity and kindness. In Louisville, \nKentucky, my hometown, we are preparing right now to receive over 500 \nevacuees who have lost their homes due to Katrina. With all their \nworldly possessions gone, they are reliant on the kindness and \ngenerosity of their fellow Americans, and we are finding all across the \ncountry that kindness and generosity is certainly not lacking.\n  Red Cross volunteers in Louisville are working around the clock to \nturn the city's fairgrounds into a temporary shelter. At home, over 300 \nfamilies turned out to shower donations on a local Salvation Army \ncenter. One man alone brought over 6,000 diapers. Others are bringing \nbasic necessities such as soap, toothpaste, and towels.\n  This spirit of generosity for our fellow man is by no means limited \nto the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Across America, we have all seen \npictures or heard stories over the last several days of millions of \ntotal strangers reaching out to help their fellow citizens who have \nbeen displaced by the tragic events on the Gulf Coast. We see Girl \nScouts filling old backpacks with clothes, blankets and, yes, a stuffed \nanimal for children who have lost everything. We hear of Boy Scouts \ncollecting food and clothes, as well as raising funds for the Red \nCross, the Salvation Army, and other aid organizations. Businesses \nsmall and large have opened their hearts, wallets, and warehouses to \nprovide cash as well as in-kind aid. Churches of all denominations have \ntaken up the cause of their brother's keeper.\n  Thanks to the support of so many Americans, the thousands of people \nfrom Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama affected by Katrina will have \na chance to build new lives. Of course, local, State, and Federal \nGovernment has the major role to play at this point. I am pleased we \nwere able to act quickly last week and pass a $10.5 billion \nappropriation for emergency response and recovery efforts. We are going \nto pass later today, hopefully, another $51.8 billion in assistance, \nand more will be on the way if and when that is needed.\n  Our thoughts and prayers are with our fellow Americans who have \ntragically lost loved ones and with many others who have lost their \nhomes and all of their worldly possessions. The Senate must focus on \nthe immediate task before us of providing support for the relief, \nrecovery, and rebuilding of the Gulf Coast region.\n  While we have much important work to do in the days and weeks ahead, \nwe can take some comfort that, once again, in the midst of a tragedy, \nthe worst of times seems to bring out the best in our people. So let us \nappreciate the people of Louisville, of Atlanta, Houston, Baton Rouge, \nand all over the country who are reaching out to help Katrina's victims \nall across the Gulf States. While one person alone may make little \ndifference in comparison to the magnitude of this disaster, millions of \nindividual acts of compassion taking place all over our country will go \na long way to alleviate the suffering.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, are we still in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is considering the appropriations \nbill for Commerce-Justice-Science.\n\n[[Page S9790]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 1661\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendments be laid aside so that I may send an amendment to the desk \nand ask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Biden] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1661.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To provide emergency funding for victims of Hurricane \n                                Katrina)\n\n       At the end of the bill, insert the following:\n\n      TITLE VII--EMERGENCY RELIEF FOR VICTIMS OF HURRICANE KATRINA\n\n       In addition to amounts otherwise provided for in this Act, \n     the following amounts are appropriated for fiscal year 2006 \n     and designated as an emergency requirement pursuant to \n     section 402 of H. Con. Res. 95 (109th Congress):\n       (1) Enhancing state and local law enforcement.--\n     $1,000,000,000 to the Community Oriented Policing Services \n     function in the following amounts:\n       (A) $700,000,000 added to the Hiring section.\n       (B) $300,000,000 to the Interoperable Communications \n     Technology section.\n       (2) Assisting children impacted by hurricane katrina.--\n     Under the Missing Children Program, $10,000,000 to the \n     National Center for Missing and Exploited Children to find, \n     unite, and transport children impacted by Hurricane Katrina \n     to their parents, legal guardian, or next of kin.\n       (3) Assisting victims of sexual abuse and domestic \n     violence.--Under the Violence Against Women Act function, \n     $8,000,000 for the Office of Violence Against Women to assist \n     victims of domestic violence and sexual abuse in the areas \n     impacted by Hurricane Katrina in the following amounts:\n       (A) $2,000,000 for the Rape Abuse and Incest National \n     Network (RAINN) to rebuild crises centers, provide emergency \n     counseling services in shelters, provide emergency counseling \n     services in shelters, provide adequate services in \n     communities with evacuees, and provide adequate short- and \n     long-term support for displaced persons across the country.\n       (B) $1,000,000 for nonprofit, nongovernmental statewide \n     coalitions serving sexual assault victims within the State to \n     be used to assist victims of sexual assault affected by \n     Hurricane Katrina as determined by the assessment of \n     statewide coalitions.\n       (C) $6,000,000 to be allocated, in consultation with the \n     Department of Health and Human Services, to nonprofit, \n     nongovernmental statewide domestic violence coalitions \n     serving domestic violence programs within the State to be \n     used to assist victims of domestic violence affected by \n     Hurricane Katrina as determined by the assessment of the \n     statewide coalitions, and that the statewide coalitions can \n     assess those needs.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I have a number of points to make today. \nThe bottom line of what I am proposing is an amendment to the Commerce-\nJustice-Science appropriations bill relating to law enforcement and \nCOPS. The bottom line is--and I will explain this briefly--No. 1, I \npropose adding $1.019 billion to assist local law enforcement, support \nvictims of domestic violence and sexual assault, and deal with some \naspects of the impact of the hurricane on local law enforcement.\n  No. 2, this amendment contains $1 billion for the Office of Community \nOriented Policing Services, the so-called COPS Program. It provides \n$700 million for hiring local officers, and it provides $300 million \nfor interoperable communications equipment for local agencies. If you \never need any evidence of the fact that we need that equipment and need \nmore of it, I think Katrina has demonstrated that, unfortunately, \nfairly well.\n  It also contains $10 million for the National Center for Missing and \nExploited Children to help find and reunite children displaced by \nHurricane Katrina, and it has $9 million to support victims of domestic \nviolence and sexual assault impacted by what happened during this \ncrisis.\n  It sounds like a lot of money--and it is a lot of money--but we have \nmade a serious mistake relating to our domestic security, our homeland \nsecurity, and our need to deal with the looming threats that flow from \nnot only national disasters we are facing now--and I hope we don't face \nanother like this--but the terrors spoken about by my friend from \nMissouri.\n  In 2002, we were aiding local law enforcement collectively by $2.4 \nbillion a year. Although there has been some correction made, this \nadministration proposed cutting that direct aid to local law \nenforcement down to $168 million. I find that mind-boggling. I find \nthat as misplaced and misunderstood a representation as I do cutting \nmoney for levees and cutting money for the Corps of Engineers, as we \nhave done the last 4 years. This is an attempt to not restore all but \nrestore part of the assistance we provided for local law enforcement in \nthe past.\n  The devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina has revealed the best and \nthe worst about our great Nation. It has revealed a great economic \ndivide that exists among our citizens, while it demonstrated as well \nthe capacity of the majority of our citizens to be compassionate and \neven heroic during times of great need. It also exposed the demons of \nsome who will use any opportunity to prey on the weak.\n  The hurricane also demonstrated the best and the worst in our \nGovernment. It is clear by all accounts that the Federal response was \ninsufficient, and we will be discussing that in the coming days, weeks, \nand months to hopefully address the concerns so that, God forbid, faced \nwith this or an attack, we would not go through the same degree of \nincompetence that seems to have been spread across the governmental \nfront.\n  It also demonstrates clearly to me we have to do more to support \nState and local law enforcement officials. These men and women, in my \nopinion, demonstrated the best the Government had to offer, as opposed \nto the sudden incompetence we have seen. The men and women in Biloxi, \nNew Orleans, and other police departments in the region have been \nworking 24 hours a day. Many of them have lost their homes, and their \nfamilies have been displaced. They have been working with limited food \nand water.\n  Many of them do not even have the facilities to take a shower and use \na restroom. Lieutenant Bennelli of the New Orleans Police Department \nstated:\n\n       I spent a year in Vietnam. The ordeal that these officials \n     have gone through has been as trying as the time I spent in \n     Vietnam.\n\n  For everyone who argues that--and I hear this a lot around here these \ndays--local law enforcement is a local problem, they should take a look \nat what is happening in the Gulf States. I know many of my colleagues--\nand I respect my colleagues who have this view, but they are into this \ndevolution of Government stuff, the new paradigm they like to talk \nabout. They talk about the new paradigm in foreign policy. They talk \nabout a new paradigm in local law enforcement in terms of devolution of \nGovernment. Translated, that means the only thing the Federal \nGovernment should do is those things which no State can do. Or put \nanother way, if the State can do any of what is required to meet the \nneeds of their citizens, only the State should do it.\n  From men and women on this floor who are equally as adamant about \nfighting crime as I have been in my years, they are saying they support \neliminating the COPS Program. Why? They say it is not the business of \nthe Federal Government. The Federal Government should not be involved \nin local law enforcement.\n  Well, I like to point out that 60 percent of all the crimes committed \nin America relate to drugs, abuse of drugs, the sale of drugs, illicit \ndrugs. Is that a State responsibility or does not that stuff come \nacross the border? Does not that stuff come from the Andes? Does not \nthat stuff come from Afghanistan? Does not that stuff come from abroad? \nWe can have the best police department, the most significant--and I \nthink we have the best law enforcement agencies in the Nation in the \nState of Delaware, and you cannot stop the drugs coming down from \nAramingo Avenue in Philadelphia. They cross State lines. So I \nrespectfully suggest to the devolution-of-Government guys that Federal \nresponsibility exists as it relates to local crime and local law \nenforcement.\n  I would like to point out another thing. God forbid we have an \nattack. Let us assume--and it was not, but let us assume some divers \nwere planting explosives to blow up the levees along the Mississippi as \nopposed to Lake Pontchartrain, which by the way is a lot higher. Who is \ngoing to find them? Is it going to be some brave special\n\n[[Page S9791]]\n\nforces officer in night vision goggles watching this happen and they \nare going to capture them or is it going to be my son who is now in the \nNational Guard down in Gulfport, MS, patrolling the streets? Is he the \none going to be doing that? No, it is going to be a local cop.\n  Who is going to find the guy or the woman or the terrorist who is \ngoing to try to put sarin gas into the Houston Astrodome or a giant \nshopping mall? It is going to be some cop coming from Dunkin' Donuts \nriding behind the facility catching someone in a dumpster.\n  I do not know what we are thinking about here. Cutting local law \nenforcement moneys? Forget Katrina, which only makes the point more \nstarkly, but forget it for a moment. What are we doing? We had a great \nPresident named Reagan who said, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.\n  Guess what. Nobody has argued the COPS Program has not succeeded. No \none has argued it has failed. A former Attorney General said, when it \nwas time to eliminate it, I think the word he used was miraculous, it \nhas been a miraculous program.\n  Let us cut it? Let us eliminate it?\n  I would make the suggestion that law enforcement is not purely a \nlocal problem. Look at what is happening in the Gulf States right now. \nLaw enforcement is a national concern and requires a national response \nand a national commitment. Local communities need robust police \ndepartments. They need superior communication technology and equipment. \nI know my friends in the Commerce Committee know more about the \nspectrum fight, which I will not get into now, than most do, but the \nidea that there is not sufficient spectrum available to our first \nresponders because the broadcast industry is unwilling to commit to the \ndeal they made is beyond me.\n  Local communities are the ones that not only affect the overall \nsecurity of the country but the day-to-day lives of their citizens by \nreducing crime. This also helps local governments be better at \nresponding in periods of crisis. What could be more important to the \nnational priority than the safety of our citizens?\n  We simply have not been doing right by our States and local \ngovernment partners over the past few years. Throughout the 1990s we \nallocated billions of dollars to hire local law enforcement, provided \nthem with the technology they needed. We all know the story. Reduce \ncrime each year for 8 consecutive years and we are still reaping the \nbenefits of those successes as crime rates still go down.\n  I would like to point out one other simple fact. Having chaired the \nJudiciary Committee or been its ranking member for I think 17 years and \nbeing on that committee for 30 years, to the best of my knowledge, \nthere is no other time in American history when the cadre of those in \ntheir crime-committing years, meaning young people between the ages of \n14 and 25, have increased and violent crime has gone down. This program \nhas worked because the States have made it work. We reduced crime, as I \nsaid, 8 years in a row. But we did more than reduce crime by this \nlegislation we have cut so drastically. We also demonstrated a \ncommitment to local agencies. We increased their capacity to respond to \nany situations of the local communities.\n  In this year's budget, we have allocated only $2 million to hire \npolice officers. This amount will hire approximately 25 officers \nthroughout the Nation, hardly a ringing endorsement of our local \nagencies. Right now, the COPS office has pending applications to hire \n8,000 local officers left unfilled due to lack of funds. The amendment \nI am offering today would provide $700 million to immediately fill \nthese needs with special emphasis on filling the needs of those \nagencies in the devastated regions. The New Orleans Police Department \nin particular will need special assistance. If this funding is \nallocated to the COPS office, it should work with those agencies first.\n  We also know that network capabilities of agencies in the area have \nbeen destroyed. We need to help them get those networks back on line so \nthey can continue to do their job. My amendment would add $300 million \nto the current allocation of $37 million, which is all that has \nbeen allocated. It would add $300 million to help agencies in the gulf \ncoast get up and running again. The COPS office has had an overtime \nprogram to help local agencies pay overtime. We all understand the need \nto assist local agencies that have been working around the clock, but \nbased on conversations with the Louisiana Association of Chiefs of \nPolice and the National Sheriffs Association, it is my understanding \nthat the Federal Emergency Management Agency will be reimbursing local \nagencies for those costs. Because of this understanding, we have not \nincluded additional assistance for overtime in this amendment.\n\n  Finally, we include $19 million for children who have been displaced \nand to support the domestic violence shelters that have been destroyed. \nThe National Center for Missing and Exploited Children has reported \nthat over 1,000 children have been displaced by this storm--that means \nthey are not with their parents or guardians--and in this amendment we \nprovide $10 million for that effort.\n  We also provide $9 million to support domestic violence victims \nimpacted by the storms. We all heard of the reports of sexual assaults \nin the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, and we will support those \nvictims who have not been moved to new shelters.\n  In addition, this funding will support the shelters in Louisiana, \nMississippi, and Alabama that have been impacted and will help support \nshelters in adjoining States that have been called upon to do much more \nin the coming months.\n  I think all of my colleagues have heard me say that I believe there \nis not a more important responsibility in Government than the safety of \nits citizens. It comes before their health, before their education, \nbefore everything. There are no civil liberties, there are no \nopportunities if one is not able to be safe on the street. Without \nsafety and security, nothing else matters. Our local law enforcement \nagencies are there every day fighting crime and responding to \nemergencies. Hurricane Katrina demonstrated quite starkly the way we \nrely on them. The Federal support for these officers has been on a \nsteady decline, as I said at the outset, the past few years. We need to \nreverse that trend. This amendment will help us get back on track.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES.

Con. Res. 95 (109th Congress).\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the leadership of \nSenator Reid and Senator Landrieu who have announced a package of \nproposals to be of assistance to the Hurricane Katrina victims so that \nthe millions of people affected by the devastation along the gulf coast \ncan begin to rebuild their lives.\n  The amendment which I have sent to the desk is only part of that \nbroader proposal and deals with the housing situation which now \nconfronts the victims of this tragic storm. Before going into the \ndetails of the proposal, I want to extend my deepest sympathies to \nthose in Louisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi who have lost loved ones \nor who are still searching for family members, neighbors, and friends. \nThey need to know that the thoughts and prayers of the country are with \nthem during these very difficult and trying times. We know that \nhundreds and hundreds of thousands of Americans have lost their houses, \ntheir jobs, their belongings, indeed, their communities.\n  An effort is now underway in the Congress to come to their \nassistance. We know the road to recovery will not be easy and it will \nnot be short, but we need to undertake these efforts immediately.\n  It was earlier estimated this week by FEMA officials and told to the \nPresident that 500,000 to a million people were rendered homeless by \nHurricane Katrina and the deadly floods that followed the hurricane. In \nfact, yesterday's New York Times reported that as many as a million \npeople are without housing. While the first job was to evacuate people, \nto get them food and water and to address their medical needs, in other \nwords, to in effect save the lives of those who have been so heavily \nimpacted, I think it is fair to say that the next job confronting us \nwould be to find adequate housing for the survivors of Katrina.\n  The Americans displaced by the hurricane are scattered throughout the \ncountry now. I want to underscore the comments made by some of my \ncolleagues earlier about the opening up of the arms of Americans across \nthe country to take people in in this time of\n\n[[Page S9793]]\n\nemergency and the great need. Families coming out of the gulf coast are \nin effect living wherever they can find a roof over their heads, with \nrelatives, with friends, with caring strangers who have volunteered to \ntake them in, in shelters--for example, Houston opened up the \nAstrodome--on cruise ships or in tents. It is fair to say if one stops \nand thinks about this for a moment it is, at best, a temporary housing \nsituation.\n  The hundreds of thousands of displaced families need to have access \nto stable housing so they can send their kids to school, start pulling \ntheir lives back together again, which is, of course, a pressing \nchallenge, seek employment and chart out a future for themselves.\n  This amendment, recognizing the overwhelming need for stable housing, \nproposes an emergency housing voucher program of $3.5 billion, which \nwould provide temporary rental assistance to more than 350,000 \ndisplaced families. It eliminates--I should say more accurately \nsuspends for a limited period of time--many of the requirements and the \nrestrictions that ordinarily apply to the housing voucher program. For \nexample, any person or family displaced as a result of Hurricane \nKatrina would be eligible to receive this much needed assistance; they \ncould get a temporary housing voucher. This is without regard to their \nincome situation. It recognizes the storm hit rich and poor alike and \nthis is an effort to give them some immediate, short-term help so they \ncan move out of the situation in which they find themselves.\n  The temporary rental vouchers would quickly and efficiently move \nfamilies into stable housing across the country in the communities to \nwhich they have relocated. So it would give them an opportunity, with \nthe voucher that would come to them, to find housing for themselves and \ntheir families. They could move out of the shelters. They could move \nout of temporary facilities. They could cease to live with relatives, \nfriends or, indeed, strangers.\n  The rental assistance will be flexible and it will be easy to use. It \nwill have payments sufficient so they can find suitable housing. The \nfunds provided could be used anywhere in the country by those who have \nbeen impacted by the hurricane whose situation was created by the \nhurricane to pay for rent, security deposits, relocation expenses and \nmoving expenses back to the affected areas at the appropriate time. So, \nif and when the time comes, they could return to their homes if that \nwas the choice.\n  The assistance would be available for an initial period of 6 months. \nIt is limited. A further 6 months is available, an extension, unless \nthe Secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development \nfinds that the assistance is no longer needed. But the maximum extent \nof these temporary housing vouchers would be 1 year. It would be 6 \nmonths, with a possibility of an extension.\n  The emergency program would be administered by HUD, which could \noperate the vouchers directly or provide the vouchers to local housing \nagencies, State and local governments or other entities, so long as the \nvouchers get out quickly to those in need.\n  We have a complicated problem here because the public housing \nauthorities, of course, are locally based. The ones in areas where the \npeople have been displaced are, in effect, out of business. There is no \nhousing there by definition, since people have had to evacuate and \nleave. These people have now been moved to different parts of the \ncountry. We need to be able to get these vouchers to them and get them \nto them quickly.\n  We know people want to return to their neighborhoods, but it will \nprobably be months before that is at all possible. Ordinarily, FEMA \nprovides trailers and other housing after a disaster. That is how \nordinarily it works. But the magnitude and scope of this disaster is \nunprecedented. FEMA has never had to deal with something of this \nmagnitude, and it was the judgment, in putting this amendment together, \nthat HUD had an expertise with respect to these rental vouchers. The \nemergency is a new dimension for HUD, but we thought that they have \ntrained staff and could take over this responsibility and move it \nforward quickly.\n  I might note that the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, \nSecretary Jackson, earlier in his career, has had very extensive \nexperience directing public housing authorities--in Washington, DC; St. \nLouis, MO, and in Dallas, TX. So he has had a lot of experience \nactually on the ground with respect to housing. We think he could \nmarshal the Department and its staff to respond in this situation.\n  This only begins to deal with the problem. I do not begin to assert \nthat this represents a total or comprehensive solution to the housing \nchallenge. But it enables us to get underway. Any family displaced by \nthe hurricane would be eligible to receive a temporary voucher to pay \nfor renting safe and decent housing, pay for rent, security, utility \ndeposits, relocation expenses, and then eventually, we hope, moving \nexpenses back to their permanent homes. These vouchers could be used \nanywhere across the country. It would not require a certification of \nincome initially in order to get the voucher, and the families would be \nrelieved of paying the rent, their portion of the rent which is \nrequired under the regular voucher program, until family members return \nto work. Once they return to work, the tenants would have to pay rental \npayments, as they do in the regular housing voucher program.\n  We are trying to cover all the bases here. We are trying to be very \nsensitive to the problem. We are trying to look at the problem through \nthe eyes of those who have been struck by the hurricane, in terms of \nhow they see it.\n  These people are now there. All kinds of makeshift housing is being \nfound for them. But that, even on a temporary basis, does not represent \nan appropriate response. So we want to move them a little further down \nthe path toward having a more normal living situation. We ease up a \nlittle bit about the amount of rent they can pay. We allow it to go a \nbit above the median instead of having to be below the median because \nwe know finding rental units will be a difficult job.\n\n  As I said, this gives authorities to HUD they do not now have to \ndirectly administer the program so they can reach out to these former \nresidents of the gulf coast who are now scattered out across the \ncountry. They can work with the housing agencies, State and local \ngovernments, and other entities. As I noted, it has a limited time \nprovision. So it would enable us to, in effect, provide all of these \npeople who have had to leave their homes an opportunity to put some \nstability into their lives. So they could then go on and deal with the \nother problems that are confronting them--the problems of getting their \nkids back in school, the problems of employment, the problems of \nmeeting all of the other pressures that have come before us. But we \nhave moved these people out. Some are being held in shelters. Others \nare being dispersed. But what is the next step for them? We think this \nrepresents the next step.\n  It is a targeted approach. The authorities it gives are temporary. \nThe limitations and restrictions it eases and removes are done on a \ntemporary basis, so it is not permanent in its eventual impact. But it \ndoes provide, for the next 6 to 12 months, a degree of stability and a \ndegree of permanence which I think is very important in enabling the \npeople who have been struck by this tragedy to help put their lives \nback together again. I very much hope, when the appropriate time comes, \nmy colleagues will support this proposal.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I wish to comment on the amendment that \nhas been offered by the senior Senator from Maryland, the ranking \nmember on Housing on the housing voucher program. I want very much to \nsupport his amendment because I think it is absolutely crucial that we \ndo this.\n  There are people who are living under three basic circumstances. No. \n1, some are shelters, which is emergency housing. God bless all of the \ncommunities, the Red Cross, the people of Texas, and everywhere that \nhave provided shelter housing. But shelter housing is for an\n\n[[Page S9794]]\n\nemergency situation, and people do need to move to stable housing.\n  Then there are those people who did evacuate. They might be of modest \nmeans, they might be of middle-class means, but they have been living \nin hotels and motels along the way. They have been living off of their \ncredit cards. They are now out of money, they are out of gas, and they \nwonder what to do next. They need to be able to move into housing. \nAlso, in order to be able to get a job, you need an address. In order \nto get a benefit, you need an address.\n  Then there is the third group of people who have been embraced by \nchurches, who are living maybe with strangers or even living with \nrelatives. But for many people, their relatives are also on a tight \nbudget, living on a shoestring or a small pocketbook. We have had \ngenerosity of spirit, generosity of heart, and even generosity of \nwallet. But that is limited until people can move into other types of \nhousing.\n  In this case, as someone who once was an appropriator for HUD, we \nneed so-called housing vouchers, known as Section 8, for either the \npoor or the elderly. Because of what has happened, everyone is poor and \nstretched to the limit, with no income. They need help. I believe this \nprogram offers both the reimbursement--the voucher--and also enough \nconstraints so that it is not a lavish giveaway program.\n  The point I also want to make is that housing is really limited, even \ntemporary housing. My colleague, Senator Sarbanes, has spoken about \nFEMA and its trailers. We know about FEMA and its trailers because we \nwere hit by Hurricane Isabel. We were absolutely grateful for them. But \nwhen I heard the FEMA trailers were coming to the Eastern Shore or \nBailey's Quarters or to Miller Island, I thought they were trailers--\nalmost a version of a manufactured home. When I went to see them and \nmeet with the people in them, they were campers. So when we hear that \nthe trailers are coming, these are not trailers the way we see in a \ntrailer park. These are kind of campers you see for an overnight and \nthey are very limited and they are also very expensive to heat or to \nair condition. But, thank God when they come.\n  Yesterday I spoke to one of the leading private-sector people who has \na substantial number, whose corporation has a substantial number of \nemployees in both Louisiana and Mississippi.\n  They tried to rent trailers and RVs to take out to their employees. \nThey were going to get hold of them and lease them--or almost rent \nfree--to their employees so the employees would have a place to work. \nThey would know where those employees were, and begin to put them back \nto work.\n  Guess what. They couldn't find any. Practically every trailer and \nevery RV in America is on its way down to the gulf. They have already \nbeen purchased or leased. We think that is great. This is a private \nsector corporation with deep pockets which is trying to jump in to \nhelp.\n  We have a sense of the magnitude of the crisis. These vouchers will \nadd an ``R'' to what we need when we talk about emergency management \nresponse. I helped to form FEMA. I will not talk about that today. We \nhave a reformed FEMA that went over to the Department called Homeland \nSecurity.\n  I believe when it did that, it lost its focus. But we had three \n``R's'' we practiced: readiness, response and recovery. I am going to \nadd a fourth ``R''--reimbursement. We have to reimburse these \ncommunities that are taking in people.\n  Look at Texas and other communities. I know your community, Mr. \nPresident, has been very generous. Again, we salute you. But we can end \nup in compassion fatigue and we need to have a government safety net.\n  I think this voucher will do a lot. I think it will also do a lot for \nmental health. If you have your own kitchen, your own stove, your own \naddress, and your children can go to school, not at a shelter--though \nGod bless the shelters--I think it will do a lot to begin to restore \npeople's sense of stability.\n  I think this is a very good idea. It is temporary. It is time \nlimited, both in terms of the flexibility of the rent, and so on. I \nthink it will go a long way to using the private marketplace and the \nprivate sector and also be able to reimburse other nonprofits that are \nalready also finding housing.\n  I salute my colleagues and the leadership for doing this, and I look \nforward to supporting it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I want to take some time to review the \nsituation we have seen in front of us for the last week. It was a \nterrible week for our country. One only had to listen to the eloquent \nremarks given by the Senator from Louisiana, Ms. Landrieu. She \ndescribed in very moving words and tones what kinds of things she \npersonally witnessed and that went on in the State of Louisiana, \nparticularly New Orleans. We all have to learn from that experience. We \nhave to be ready for any eventuality.\n  The American people watched in horror and disbelief as this \nincredible tragedy played out on live television in Louisiana, \nMississippi, and Alabama. For most of us, it was from the safety of our \nhomes or businesses that we watched with horror our fellow Americans \nsuffering unbelievable loss and pain.\n  The worst part is, as we watched this tragedy evolve, with thousands \nbeing displaced from their homes and families, without a significant \nresponse, why did they suffer so long before appropriate action was put \ninto place? That is because the Federal Government was not prepared. \nHow could the administration not have been prepared for this? We had \nadvance warning that a major disaster was looming. We see this picture. \nIt tells you what is happening. Sunday, August 28, the swirl of the \nwind and the ferocity of the action is almost enough to frighten you \njust looking at this picture.\n  August 28, Sunday, Katrina became a massive hurricane, a category 5. \nIt was in the Gulf of Mexico headed right for a large American city--a \ncity with tradition and history that all of us relate to. Actually, \nhowever, this city sat below sea level--New Orleans. The mayor of New \nOrleans on that Sunday ordered a mandatory evacuation of the city. This \nwasn't news, friends. No. This was obvious. You were going to get a \npunch in the face like you never had before, and your opponent was \nstanding full fist in front of you.\n\n  Massive flooding was predicted before the storm hit. At 6 a.m. Monday \nmorning, Hurricane Katrina and its storm surge hit greater New Orleans \nand the Mississippi coast. About 80 percent of the city's residents \nwere able to flee. Others, especially the elderly, the infirm, and the \npoor were left behind.\n  Also, on Monday, the 17th Street levee in New Orleans broke, and \nwater flooded the city.\n  One only needs to ask our junior Senator from Mississippi about the \nwave of water that destroyed his house. He told me it was 26 feet high. \nThat is more than two stories. Levees gave way, and floodwaters quickly \novertook homes. Residents scrambled for their lives, seeking refuge on \nrooftops. We all saw the vivid pictures of the heroic Coast Guard \nrescue putting people in baskets, or hanging onto them, around their \nnecks, to get them out of the way of the oncoming flood. More than 30 \nelderly residents of a nursing home died in that rapidly rising tide.\n  On Monday, August 29--remember, the first picture was Sunday. That \nwas the warning we saw going on. On Monday, August 29, many in New \nOrleans were evacuating their homes in rushing waters trying to keep \nthemselves and their families from drowning.\n  Here is a photo taken about midday that Monday. I would appreciate it \nif those who see this would keep this time in mind.\n  That terrible image--look at it. People were standing in water up to \ntheir waists. Some are up to their necks, and obviously holding \nchildren, and at the same time holding bundles on their heads to keep \nthem dry.\n  By Tuesday, we saw conditions deteriorating at the Louisiana \nSuperdome where people had already sought refuge. They suddenly needed \nto move again.\n  A reporter at the scene told grim stories of no food, no air \nconditioning, no usable water, overflowing toilets in the Superdome, \nand of tens of thousands of human beings who were stranded in these \ninhumane conditions.\n  While media members were spread across New Orleans, the Federal \nGovernment seemed to have no presence\n\n[[Page S9795]]\n\nwhatsoever. I remember personally watching Jean Meserve reporting for \nCNN, almost being blown over by the ferocity of the winds, with tears \nin her eyes, in a quivering voice. She was crying as she gave her \nreport about the horror she was witnessing. She was barely able to hold \nherself in position.\n  These desperate people trudged up elevated highways and overpasses. I \nam sure they assumed that help would soon come. But even though they \nwaited in plain sight on an elevated highway, no help arrived. So they \nbaked in the heat, and they looked desperately toward the skies for any \nhint of help. But there was little sign from the Federal Government; no \nsign of help other than the courageous Coast Guard rescue teams pulling \npeople off of rooftops.\n  On Tuesday, as this devastation was being unleashed on New Orleans, \nwhere was President Bush? He flew to California, in the opposite \ndirection of the crisis as tens of thousands of Americans were fighting \nfor their lives, many of them dying. The President was in California. \nIt was an important moment. He gave a speech commemorating VJ Day. I \nremember VJ very clearly. I was on a ship going from Europe where I \nserved during the war back to America to go on to Japan. It was an \nimportant moment. But was it important enough for the President to \nleave his post, to leave his command, when people were trying to stay \nalive? This is a picture taken on Tuesday, August 30, 2005. It was 2:56 \neastern time, which made it about 2 hours difference in central time, \nNew Orleans. The President was enjoying the day. He was strumming a \nguitar. I don't deny him the pleasures of office. But people were \ndrowning. They were trying to save their lives, save their homes, and \nsave their kids at the same time. The President was not in touch with \nthe country. It was one of the worst failures of leadership in our \nNation's history. It was like an Army preparing for battle only to find \nout that the top general has gone AWOL.\n  Millions of Americans asked: How could this happen in the 21st \ncentury in America?\n  Our hearts were broken--all of us, anybody who saw it. I remember \nconversations with family and friends, and how horrified they were to \nsee people struggling. They heard tales of children being swept from \nparents' arms, of the woman who sat with her husband as he pleaded for \nneeded medication. And he died in her presence.\n  Senator Landrieu told us the story about the man who was sent to \nprotect the mayor of New Orleans. He stayed with the mayor 3 days. When \nhe went to his home, he found that his wife and children had died. He \nwas so overcome he took a pistol and blew his head off. He committed \nsuicide. How terrible.\n\n  What many people do not understand is the incompetence of the \nleadership in their country. It seems to be almost an indifference. \nWhat many Americans concluded last week is that the Bush administration \ncannot protect us. When faced with a real crisis, the White House \ndisplayed a lack of involvement, a failure of leadership.\n  To make matters worse, our President refuses to accept \nresponsibility. President Truman--who sat at this very desk; his name \nis written here--said: The buck stops here.\n  That is not what we saw from the White House those terrible days. Now \nthe President has an idea about how to determine what went wrong. He \nwants to begin an investigation, headed by himself. An investigation of \nself is not the best way to get the facts.\n  The hurricane that struck New Orleans on August 29 was a force of \nnature. But the damage and the disaster that followed was compounded by \na failure of leadership.\n  Since the President and the President's team have already mishandled \nmuch of this tragedy, I urge my colleagues to roll up our sleeves and \nfollow the lead of Senator Landrieu, with Senator Vitter, Senator Lott, \nSenator Cochran, as we craft a plan for recovery for these devastated \ncommunities. We have a moral obligation to rebuild not just these \nbusinesses and landmarks but homes and communities, schools in every \ncommunity, regardless of class or color.\n  One of our Republican colleagues said something this past weekend, in \ntalking about the people who were suffering so much in the gulf area:\n\n       You have people who don't heed those warnings and they put \n     people at risk as a result of not heeding those warnings.\n\n  He further said there is a need to look at tougher penalties on those \nwho decide to risk it and understand there are consequences for not \nleaving; to administer more punishment to these people who did not heed \nthe warning, who did not want to leave their homes, who did not want to \nleave their familiar territory, who did not want to leave a relative, \nperhaps; to put more punishment on them, suggesting that losing a \nchild, losing a home, losing momentos, or losing a history is not \nenough. We should punish them further? A Senator suggested that. What \nan outrage. Yes, he yielded later and said he might have been \nmisunderstood. Read that Senator's words.\n  We have to learn from this terrible tragedy. The country certainly is \nalert to the risks we face from terror, from human-initiated attack. In \nthe State of New Jersey we lost 700 people; New York, almost 2,000. We \nlearned a lot. We learned we have to protect ourselves. It appears the \nnumber of dead in Louisiana and Mississippi is going to exceed the \nnumber, as terrible as it was, of September 11. So we have to prepare \nourselves in some way to deal with that problem just as ardently, just \nas thoroughly, as we fight terrorism.\n  We need to pass legislation as soon as possible. I hope we will not \nbe delayed in doing that by recriminations from those who would pass \nthe buck elsewhere, away from the place the responsibility belongs.\n  We need to tell the gulf coast community that we believe in them, \nthat the road to recovery is being built, and that we will then proceed \nto examine the history of what got us there. People understood in many \nquarters the levees were weak. The question arises about what we did to \nshore them up. I hope that examination will take place in the immediate \nfuture.\n  We salute those people who have endured the most unimaginable \ntragedy--to have loved ones swept away by flood waters, to have \nmemories taken away. In lots of places it was not just the housing but \nthe memorabilia, the trinkets of childhood, childbearing, raising kids, \nand seeing it disappear. We have to be stronger. We have to be more \nleaderly. We cannot be AWOL when trouble strikes. I hope we will work \ntogether on a bipartisan basis, as they say, and do the right thing.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1665\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf \nof myself, Senator Graham, and Senator Stabenow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan], for himself, \n     Mr. Graham, and Ms. Stabenow, proposes an amendment numbered \n     1665.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To prohibit weakening any law that provides safeguards from \n                    unfair foreign trade practices)\n\n       On page 190, between lines 14 and 15, insert the following:\n       Sec. 522. None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made \n     available by this Act may be used to negotiate or enter into \n     a trade agreement that modifies or amends any law of the \n     United States that provides safeguards from unfair foreign \n     trade practices to United States businesses or workers, \n     including (1) imposition of countervailing and antidumping \n     duties (title VII of the Tariff Act of 1930; 19 U.S.C. 1671 \n     et seq.); (2) protection from unfair methods of competition \n     and unfair acts in the importation of articles (section 337 \n     of the Tariff Act of 1930; 19 U.S.C. 1337); (3) relief from \n     injury caused by import competition (title II of the Trade \n     Act of 1974; 19 U.S.C. 2251 et seq.); (4) relief from unfair \n     trade practices (title III of the Trade Act of\n\n[[Page S9796]]\n\n     1974; 19 U.S.C. 2411 et seq.); or (5) national security \n     import restrictions (section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act \n     of 1962; 19 U.S.C. 1862).\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this is an amendment that is relatively \nsimple. It would prohibit funding in this bill for our trade \nnegotiators to enter into any agreement that would weaken U.S. trade \nlaws, such as antidumping laws and countervailing duty laws. Let me \ndescribe why these are important.\n  We have provisions in our law that establish some level of protection \nfor American industries if some foreign company or foreign country \ndecides to dump products into our country at artificially low prices in \norder to capture a market or destroy an industry. These are the \nantidumping laws. We also have laws that provide for the opportunity to \napply countervailing duties on products that come into this country \nthat are unfairly subsidized and attempt to undercut American \nbusinesses.\n  Why do I offer this amendment? Because we have U.S. negotiators who \nare engaged in WTO negotiations who are saying that everything is on \nthe table; we are willing to negotiate away the protections that exist \nfor fair trade for American businesses, American jobs, and American \nindustries.\n  We have the highest trade deficit in the history of this country. We \nhave massive numbers of American jobs moving overseas every single day. \nAmerican companies are closing their businesses, and American jobs are \nmoving overseas.\n  I have told the story repeatedly--and I will not tell it in great \ndepth again--about Huffy bicycles. They used to be an American company. \nNo longer. Huffy bikes are now made in China. Those proud workers in \nAmerica made $11 an hour plus benefits. They all got fired. Were they \nbad workers? No. That company makes Huffy bicycles in China now and \npays 33 cents an hour, working workers 7 days a week, 12 to 14 hours a \nday, and then they ship the Huffy bicycles back to this country to be \nsold.\n  Interestingly enough, since they moved to China, Huffy has declared \nbankruptcy. It has now been purchased by a Chinese company, and they \nsay they still want this to be one of the leading brands in America. \nNotice that I said ``brands.'' They don't want to make them here. It is \ntoo expensive to pay $11 to American workers to produce bicycles in \nthis country; they just want the right to sell them here.\n  I have given long speeches about the fact that Levi's doesn't make a \nsingle pair of Levi's anymore. That great American brand is now \nproduced offshore. They are made by contract production in Haiti, Sri \nLanka, Indonesia, Bangladesh, India, and China.\n  I have given speeches about the fact that if you wear your Tony Lama \ncowboy boots, they may not be American; they may be Chinese.\n  I have given speeches talking about the fact that if you like Mexican \nfood, you can eat Fig Newton cookies, because Fig Newton moved to \nMonterey, Mexico. So if you want Mexican food, go buy Fig Newtons.\n  I have given speeches at length about jobs leaving this country. We \nhave the biggest trade deficit in this country. It is dangerous. The \nquestion is, When will this country have the nerve, the backbone, and \nthe will to stand up for the economic interests of this country?\n  I am not suggesting putting walls up around this country; I am just \nsuggesting demanding fair trade. We had people die on the streets of \nthis country for the right of workers to organize. In the last century, \nwe decided issues about minimum wage, about child labor laws, about \nrules that say you cannot dump chemicals into the air and the water \nfrom your production plant.\n  We had people work very hard over a century to achieve these rules \nand regulations, which establish decent conditions of production. One \ncan now escape all that by pole-vaulting over it. Move the plant to \nChina, move the plant to Bangladesh, move the plant to Honduras and \nhire workers who will work for pennies on the dollar. Hire workers who \nwill work for 33 cents an hour. Hire 12-year-olds and pay them 12 cents \nan hour and work them 12 hours a day and then ship the product to Los \nAngeles, Detroit, Fargo, or Mobile. Meanwhile, who is going to buy \nthese products when American jobs have been lost, American workers are \ntold they are no longer affordable, their jobs are gone?\n  Little Red Wagon Radio Flyer, we all rode in that Little Red Wagon \nwhen we were kids. For 100 years that company produced in this country, \nand now it is all gone. So it can be produced more cheaply, less \nexpensively by hiring workers who will work for pennies an hour.\n  As we engage in new trade negotiations, which threaten to once again \npull the rug out from under American workers and American businesses, \nthis amendment says something very simple: We will not allow the \nfunding we have approved in this appropriations bill to be used to \nweaken our trade laws.\n  The United States-China Commission, a bipartisan commission \nestablished by Congress, sent us a letter August 1, 2005, that warned \nthat the proposals that our trade negotiators are discussing with \nrespect to antidumping and countervailing duties ``could severely limit \nour ability to protect our economic interests.'' That is from the \nUnited States-China Commission, a bipartisan commission.\n  The Commission reiterated the proposals put on the table by foreign \nnegotiators ``could have substantial impact on our nation's ability to \nutilize our trade laws and ensure that American farmers, workers, and \nbusinesses have the tools they need to respond to unfair and predatory \nforeign trade practices.''\n  So the question for us is, Are we going to do anything about that? I \nhope the answer is, yes. I hope the answer is to say to our trade \nnegotiators that we understand that foreign negotiators are proposing \nto weaken our trade laws. Our trade negotiators must have the backbone \nand the will to stand up for our economic interests, something they \nhave not been willing to do for a long time.\n  I offer this amendment, which is a prohibition on funding. It is \ngermane, and I hope to have a vote on it when we have had a proper \namount of time to discuss it.\n  One final point. I intend to offer another amendment which I cannot \noffer at this moment. It is an amendment that I will offer to other \nappropriations bills as well if it is not acceptable here, and that is \nto establish a Truman-type committee to investigate the waste, fraud, \nand abuse in contracting that is going on in the Middle East, \nparticularly in Iraq. I have described the conditions of Halliburton \nand other companies that have been given billions of dollars, have \nwasted a substantial amount of money, are now under criminal \ninvestigation, and are given a slap on the wrist and a pat on the back \nand more money and nobody seems to care. I believe there ought to be a \nTruman-type committee of the type Harry Truman headed long ago when \nthere was a Democrat in the White House and a Democratic Senator said: \nWe must investigate this kind of spending and profligate waste and \nabuse.\n  I will ask that the Senate at some point decide that there ought to \nbe oversight on what is happening to the taxpayers' money. I will offer \nthat amendment tomorrow. I have offered this amendment today for its \nconsideration, and I hope that as we go along that we will be able to \nget a vote on this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, is it appropriate to speak on hurricane \nmatters at this time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may speak on any matter he wishes \nat this time.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, Hurricane Katrina was a colossal natural \ndisaster. Every hurricane is different. They bring different stresses \nand different damages. My home is in the city of Mobile, Alabama, right \non the gulf coast. We were without power for 3 days. Trees and houses \nwere damaged. Portions of the city were flooded that have not been \nflooded before. We experienced the highest surge of water up Mobile Bay \ndriven by this storm that we have seen in anybody's lifetime there.\n  The surge in the fishing communities of Bayou La Batre and Coden were \nunlike anything they have seen before--my best estimate is 5 feet \ndeeper than we have ever seen before. I spent 3 days in that community \nworking with and talking to the people. Many of them lived in small \nframed houses, some in\n\n[[Page S9797]]\n\nmobile homes and things of that nature, that they have lived in for \nquite a long time in areas that had never flooded before but flooded \nthis time.\n  I will share a story of heroism that is symbolic of what happened, I \nam sure, throughout the gulf coast. It is regarding a young State \ntrooper a corporal, Spencer Collier, also an Alabama State legislator, \na wonderful young man, my wife and I have come to admire him so much \nwhose house flooded, as did most of the leaders of the town of Bayou La \nBatre. The town began to receive 911 calls at the height of the storm. \nHe and a marine resource officer and others, got in a vehicle and drove \ndown to where the water was rising with 100-mile-per-hour winds \nblowing. They put their boat out and, before they could cast off, the \nwater had risen so fast that the entire vehicle was flooded. They went \nout and they made the first trip to rescue stranded individuals. They \nwent out in this storm, traveling almost a mile to an area where water \nhad never reached before in this town. They rescued people and brought \nthem back.\n\n  Unfortunately, the first boat sank. Mayor Stan Wright had a flat-\nbottom boat and they put it to work. He said it was a good boat. It \nworked quite well, but the bottom was thin and they were worried about \nit. They went out in these waves and in this storm under great live oak \ntrees that were blowing, houses had been completely demolished towards \nthe beach as well as inland. The water was littered with trash and \ndebris, and they made six trips and brought people out. One lady had \nseveral children. So they left one of their group there holding two of \nthe children. They took the boat back, came back again and got the \nchildren, and they had to leave the guy because they did not have room \nin the boat.\n  All the time his house was being flooded, and he spent days, as did \nthe other members of the city government, working for the people of \nthat community, even though their own homes were flooded. So that is \nthe kind of thing we are talking about.\n  I talked to people remaining in town the next day. The storm ended \nMonday night. We still had strong winds at 5, 6, 7, even 8 at night. It \nbegan to calm down after going all day long. I talked to those people \nTuesday afternoon. Many of them were in food lines provided by the good \nold Salvation Army. They were the first ones there serving hot meals, \nwith a tub of ice and bottled water. People were lined up. They had not \nhad a meal. The electricity was all off. The phones were off. Most of \nthe cell phones did not work. Cell phone batteries quickly go down. \nThey could not make phone calls. They lined up there. Several in that \nfirst line I talked to said: Senator, this is all we have. We lost \neverything we had. These clothes on my back are all we have. We had to \nget out of our house. The water flooded everything. I don't know what \nwe are going to do.\n  I met a young lady who asked me that night what about her \ngrandfather's Social Security check? They were from New Orleans. They \nleft the New Orleans area. They had come up here. They were expecting \nto go back. I knew what she was saying. She was saying they did not \nhave any money. I called Wallace Davis of the Volunteers of America, a \ngreat organization in the Mobile area, and he really came through. I \nasked him to do what he could, and he immediately went into action. He \nbrought some of his own money.\n  He said: I have money. I am telling you I have seen hurricanes \nbefore, and some people just need a little cash.\n  They gave them a little cash, and I saw her the next morning and she \nwas a new person. That would allow them to get to other relatives and \nmaybe stay with them and get gasoline or food in that fashion.\n  So I want to say this: Many of the homes there are lost. On the east \nend of Dauphin Island, which is a sizable barrier island with a great \nmany beachfront homes on it, one-third of the homes are completely \ngone, one-third badly damaged, and one-third somewhat damaged on the \nisland. On the west end, the percentage of homes lost was even greater. \nThe homes that were for many years on beautiful Mobile Bay around Point \nClear and the Grand Hotel, homes that had not flooded before, flooded \nbecause of this surge of water. Homes that were built up high in recent \nyears under hurricane restrictions did not flood, but many of those old \nhomes suffered a good deal of damage.\n  I just say that to point out that, without a doubt, we are going to \nhave to spend more on this hurricane than we have ever spent before. \nPeople need us now. Many of these people I have talked with and I met \nwere working class American citizens not living on the beach. People on \nthe beaches, for the most part, have a second home. They have \ninsurance. Maybe they can get by, although they are going to take a big \nhit. But these people were hurting, and hurting badly. We are going to \nneed to step it up.\n  When I see the damage from the incredible force of this hurricane on \nthe Mississippi coast, our neighbors, and then in New Orleans with this \nincredible levee break and the floods there, I know we are in for a big \njob.\n  I served as a U.S. attorney for 12 years. I had the responsibility, \neven as an assistant U.S. attorney in the 1970s after Camille, to \nsurvey the aftermath. I had to prosecute people for fraud, theft, and \nabuse in hurricane cleanups. When this much money gets put out this \nfast, there is a real danger of mischief.\n  I have been in the Senate long enough to get a feel for things. I \nbelieve that the Senate is now in a bit of a hurricane mode; that all \nof Congress is--maybe even the White House--and that mode is that we do \nnot need to be too careful. We need to get money out fast, and we need \nto pour it in there, and if we need 50,000 troops, let us send 70,000 \nto make sure.\n  Now we are seeing figures that it is going to cost $200 billion to \ncomplete this reconstruction. All of us know there is no money to pay \nfor this. It is not coming out of our regular budget. That is not the \nplan. It will come in an emergency supplemental appropriations bill, \nand that means it will be added straight to the national debt, and our \nchildren and grandchildren will pay it, plus the interest that \naccumulates on it.\n  So I think this Congress is doing the right thing in moving forward \nrapidly, but I think our majority leader, our appropriations leaders, \nour House leadership, and the President also need to be thinking about \nhow to spend the money responsibly. Trust me, there will be abuses. \nPeople think we can just send our military to the region, but the \nDepartment of Defense is going to charge the disaster fund for the \nmoney they spend. These expenses will be allocated to the disaster. All \nthe other responding Federal agencies are going to bill the fund for \nthe disaster-related expenditures they incur as well.\n  We are so pleased to see that States are just doing whatever it takes \nto bring schoolchildren in from these areas and do extra things for \nthem, but we are already hearing--as we did this morning--they want to \nbe paid for it by somebody. They ought to be paid for some of that.\n\n  Governor Riley, in Alabama, has said that we will take any \nschoolchild who is in our State but cannot go home. We will take them. \nWe will put them in a school somewhere in Alabama. Our community \ncolleges have said that, no matter what, we will take you. If you don't \nhave tuition right now, we will still take you anyway.\n  While this is happening, people are making contributions and I think \nthat is important. But $1 billion is a lot of money. We probably have \nless than 5,000 homes seriously damaged in our area. Maybe it is 4,000 \nin the Bayou La Batre area, or maybe less. If you gave me $1 billion, I \ncould build 10,000 new houses worth $100,000 each. One billion dollars \nis a lot of money. A billion dollars is a thousand million.\n  But, now we are going to be in a big rush. FEMA is going to pay \npeople who did not have flood insurance. Most of them should have \ngotten it. They should have, but they will still qualify under the \ngrant program and can receive up to a maximum--all of them wouldn't get \nthis much--up to a maximum of $26,000. I asked FEMA's Mr. Burns today \nif he discussed with the Senators how much it would be, and he said the \nmaximum would be up to $26,000. That will include, I think, the $2,000 \nthat some received today. So it would be $24,000, maybe, for someone \nwho already received the money.\n  I said, when do you pay it? Apparently, we are already beginning to \npay\n\n[[Page S9798]]\n\nit. It is like flood insurance, I guess. If you have insurance and your \nhouse is destroyed and the adjuster comes out and admits your house is \ndestroyed, they write you a check, sometimes on the spot.\n  So this money is going to run out quickly. If this money is being \nallocated this quickly--before somebody has come up with a plan about \nwhich neighborhoods should be rebuilt--in Alabama, Mississippi, or even \nin New Orleans--we could end up with that money being unwisely spent \nand maybe not having enough money to help people construct the kind of \nhouses they would like.\n  Senator Shelby, I, and Congressman Jo Bonner talked with Secretary \nAlphonso Jackson of HUD when he was in Mobile, AL, last week. We \ndiscussed with him the possibility of using the FEMA money--whatever \nthey get--plus some of the loans HUD already has for people of low \nincome, to help buy a home. What if we use a small portion of these \nmillions of dollars that are coming from charitable organizations? \nMaybe we could get some real estate people and some architects to help \nus redesign some of these communities and make them both beautiful and \nhabitable--and safe so this wouldn't happen again.\n  Do you see what I am saying? There are so many things happening right \nnow, so fast. Some of this, almost by law, is required to be done in \nthis fashion.\n  We need somebody, I believe, to be a manager for the President. I am \noffering a sense-of-the-Senate resolution to call on the President to \nchoose a person of his liking to be his representative with regard to \nspending, fraud, management, and reconstruction. I believe that the \nPresident should do that. It would be a person of his choice, in the \nmode of a Mit Romney or Peter Uberhoff who were put in charge of \nOlympic Games and billions of dollars in finances at stake there. We \nneed someone with real experience who doesn't have a political agenda, \nsomeone who would come in and report to the President on a daily basis, \nreport to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, and who \ncould call on the Cabinet to help coordinate the relief. You might say \nhe will not have any power. Listen, I spent a long time in the Federal \nGovernment. I know who has power in the Federal Government. The person \nwho has power in the Federal Government is the person the President \nsays has power. If he chooses this person and he tells his Cabinet: I \nselected him and I want you to work with him. If he asks you to do \nsomething, I hope you will do it. If you can't do it, I want him to \ntell me, and you can come explain to me why you didn't do it. That is \nall it takes. Things will start work better.\n  Anyway, I am hoping something like that will happen because this is \nso massive and the potential for fraud and abuse is so great we are \ngoing to have to watch it.\n  We have towns and communities that are badly hurt. They have lost \nsales tax revenues and now they are going to be fighting for every dime \nthey can get. They are going to be pushing the rules and regulations to \nthe breaking point and beyond. We are going to have Congressmen and \nSenators browbeating us in here with stories that say: Forget the \nrules, send out the money. We all know that is going to happen. But I \ndon't think the people of my State want us to waste any money.\n  The people of my state want to help people in need. They want to be \ngenerous. They expect this Government to respond, and respond quickly, \nto take care of people whose lives are at risk.\n  The people of my state know that this is bigger than we have ever \nseen before. They know that anyone can make mistakes and that you \ncannot anticipate certain things. They want the government to \nconstantly get better and improve our response.\n  But they don't want us wasting money. They don't want us throwing \nmoney at a problem that we have not thought through carefully. They \nwant us to be careful with their money.\n  In fact, if we are careful, we can get a lot more good done for a lot \nmore communities. At this point I am not at liberty to explain to you \nwhat I think ought to be done. I am not able to. I don't know what \nought to be done and how, precisely, the money should be spent at this \ntime. But I have been there in the aftermath of hurricane cleanups, and \nI am telling you, it is a difficult thing to keep control of. The \ngovernment will spend your money before you know what happened to it.\n\n  That has happened before when there was a far smaller area of \ndevastation than we have today. FEMA is going to be stretched from \nLouisiana to the Florida line. We have more people involved here than \nalmost any hurricane ever, and the extent of the disaster is larger \nthan ever. It is going to be even more difficult to monitor this \nrecovery carefully. Some things are not going to be able to be done as \nfast as we would like to see them done. But if we do it right, I think \nwe can meet the needs of our people, be generous to the American \npeople, and also maintain the rule of law as we go forward.\n  There are some special things that are going to be needed to be done. \nI talked to Senator Lott, and he is correct. Normally, when a hurricane \nhits and a person has trees down in their yard and shingles off their \nroof, that person takes all that to the street. They are responsible \nfor it. They cut up the limbs, bring them out to the road, and FEMA \npays for someone to come by and pick it up. It is a marvelous thing, I \nam telling you. If everyone had trees down in their yard and if \neverybody had to hire a tree surgeon to come haul them away, it would \nbe an incredible cost. Volunteers come in with power saws and help \npeople do it, and neighbors help neighbors, and you get that done. But \nif your house is blown away, the streets do not just have trees \ngathered up. There are whole chunks of houses, debris, foundations, \nnails, lumber, glass, and that kind of thing. It is more than the widow \nlady or the elderly can do to get that out there to the street.\n  We are going to have to create some rules, particularly in these \nareas that are hardest hit. We must allow the Federal Government to \nhelp compensate, and it must be allowed go onto the private property \nand help get some of this debris away. Many of the people will have \nlost their jobs and don't have an income. They will not be able to have \nthat done on their own.\n  Those are some of my thoughts. I salute the majority leader and the \nDemocratic leadership for moving the $10 billion supplemental promptly. \nThat was a good thing last week.\n  Under the Anti-Deficiency Act, FEMA cannot expend a dime that has not \nbeen authorized by Congress. FEMA has already used up all of that \nmoney. It is a crime for them to violate the law that says you can't \nspend money Congress has not appropriated. The result is that we must \ncome back and do it again quickly. We are running out of money again \nquicker than we thought, and we had to respond.\n  I salute the majority leader for bringing us up to date and doing it \nfast, but I say we are moving awfully fast now. It is time for our \nleadership, both in the Congress and in the White House, to ask how can \nwe make sure we have integrity, wisdom, and good sense in handling this \ndisaster.\n  If we do so, we can make some of these communities bloom again. We \ncan make some of these towns and areas as beautiful as they were \nbefore. It has happened before. We have had disasters and we bounced \nback before, and we will bounce back again. It is the right approach.\n  I thank everybody in this country--faith-based groups, volunteers, \ncivic groups--for the resources they provided to our people in Alabama. \nWe got a call from the national group that makes modular housing and \nthey were sending five office trailers down. They agreed to send one to \nMobile. I talked to them. A group from Indiana sent in two 53-foot \ntrailers. A businessman in north Alabama sent $100,000.\n  The mayor of Ozark sent down two trucks and himself and a whole team \nto help. He adopted the city of Bayou La Batre. The mayor of Gadsden in \nnorth Alabama adopted the town of Bon Secour. Steve Means, the mayor of \nGadsden, came down and was of great help and assistance. That kind of \nthing was helping, spontaneously, with resources all across the \ncountry.\n  We are hopeful, pleased, and thankful. And that is the most common \nfeeling I have observed, as did my wife, who served in the food lines \nin Bayou La Batre and talked to people. People are thankful. It is \namazing. You begin to count your blessings and recognize what is \nimportant in life when that occurs.\n\n[[Page S9799]]\n\n  Also, people are not whining, not the people I have talked to. They \nknow this was a storm that nobody caused. They know it is a difficult \ntime. They are thankful for the assistance they have received from \ntheir neighbors, and they are not complaining about the situation. It \nhas made me proud to represent them.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1669\n\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the pending \namendments be set aside for the purpose of offering an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I ask for consideration of an amendment \nthat I had earlier sent to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Sununu] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1669.\n\n  Mr. SUNUNU. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To increase funding for the State Criminal Alien Assistance \nProgram, the Southwest Border Prosecutors Initiative, and transitional \n           housing for women subjected to domestic violence)\n\n       On page 131, line 14, strike ``$15,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$30,000,000''.\n       On page 134, between lines 4 and 5, strike ``$170,000,000'' \n     and insert ``$230,582,000''.\n       On page 134, between lines 4 and 5, strike ``$30,000,000'' \n     and insert ``$48,418,000''.\n       On page 156, strike lines 3 through 7 and insert the \n     following:\n       In addition, for necessary expenses for existing grant \n     projects of the Advanced Technology Program of the National \n     Institute of Standards and Technology, $46,000,000, to remain \n     available until expended.\n\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I offer an amendment today to make some \nchanges in the funding allocations that are found in this bill. I very \nmuch appreciate the work of the subcommittee chairman and the ranking \nmember. I know, having served on the Appropriations Committee in the \nHouse, it is not an easy task. You are asked to set a lot of \npriorities, to make a lot of decisions about a good deal of money. It \nis not an easy task, but the purpose of bringing the bill to the floor \nis to give us an opportunity to adjust those priorities. I attempt to \ndo so in this amendment in a couple of ways.\n  In this amendment I increase the funding in two general areas: first, \nin the area of border security and prosecution of illegal aliens who \nhave committed crimes. This is an area that I think many people would \nsay is in crisis right now, the problem with securing our borders, the \nproblem with illegal aliens, and specifically the problem of dealing \nwith the costs associated with illegal aliens who are committing \ncrimes, violent crimes and otherwise. In this amendment I increase \nfunding for the Criminal Alien Assistance Program by $60 million. It is \nstill well short of the funding that has been provided in the companion \nbill in the House.\n  But it is an increase which I think will be well used. It deals in \nthe area of illegal immigration and criminal alien assistance that I \nthink most everyone agrees is in a crisis situation now with the state \nof emergency having been declared in parts of the Southwest to deal \nwith this type of problem.\n  Similarly, this amendment increases funding by $18 million for the \nSouthwest Border Initiative that deals with prosecution, helping our \nSouthwestern States deal with the costs associated with prosecuting \naliens that have committed crimes against the laws of those States and \nthe Federal Government.\n  It brings that level of funding up to the President's level. I think \nthe President's request in this particular area was well warranted, \ngiven how much attention has been given to the problem of illegal \naliens in recent years.\n  This increases funding in this critical area by $78 million.\n  My amendment also provides additional funding of $50 million to \ntransitional housing for women who have been exposed to domestic \nviolence. This is a relatively new program. It is authorized at $30 \nmillion per year. The bill appropriates only $15 million. I would \nincrease that to $30 million for this transitional housing program, \nwhich is part of the programs authorized under the Violence Against \nWomen Act. Transitional housing is critical. It meets the needs of \nthose who require emergency shelter services or crisis intervention. \nThere is no other program funded by the Federal Government that \nprovides transitional housing solely for victims of domestic violence \nand sexual assault. This is not typically the case in the Federal \nGovernment. There are no other sources of funding, and we ought to \nprovide funding at the authorized level.\n  In the State of New Hampshire, there are 12 emergency shelters for \nbattered women. The average length of stay is about 27 nights.\n  Therein lies the immediate need for transitional housing. I think \nthat is probably a story that is repeated in State after State.\n  I think it is not only a worthwhile area but an area in need of \nfunds, an area where there are no other programs at the Federal \nGovernment level for meeting this need.\n  The funds that I allocate to deal with criminal alien prosecution and \ntransitional housing for those affected by domestic violence will come \nfrom the Advanced Technology Program, APT. This is a program that has \nlong been targeted for elimination. The funds over the last several \nyears have been phased down.\n  Last year, funding was provided only for existing contracts--for no \nnew contracts. I think it makes sense to at lease hold the line at that \nlevel. So I scaled back funding to a level that is appropriate to cover \nall the existing contracts so anyone who has an obligation under ATP \nwill have that obligation met. We simply would not provide funds for \nadditional contracts. I think that is the right policy. I think the \nentire program should be phased down and eliminated for a few \nfundamental reasons.\n  First and foremost, this duplicates what already exists in the \nprivate sector. The ATP program gives funding to private companies that \nare developing new programs. That is why we have a venture capital \nsystem. That is why we have the private banking system. That is why we \nhave private equity funding--to support companies that are competing in \nthe marketplace and developing new products every day. I used to work \nfor a technology firm. We developed new products, and we certainly \ndidn't look to the Federal Government to fund new product development. \nIt is a historic marketplace because inevitably you will have a \nbureaucrat in Washington deciding which new product ideas get funding \nand which do not. That is not a good idea and not a good use of public \nresources--to try to pick winners and losers in the product development \nmarketplace.\n  Finally, these are funds, resources, public funding that are going to \nprivate companies, many of which are very profitable and very \nsuccessful. We shouldn't have an industrial policy at the Federal level \nthat provides unnecessary subsidies to private corporations.\n  I think we can do better. We can find better areas in which to \nallocate these resources--dealing with illegal immigration, crimes \ncommitted by illegal aliens, and transitional housing for those \naffected by domestic violence.\n  Those are certainly priorities that are much more significant, much \nmore valuable, much more appropriate than a project that subsidizes \nprivate companies.\n  The final point about the Advanced Technology Program: It has been \nallocated at over $100 million, $150 million to $200 million, depending \non how far back in time you go.\n  I simply ask my colleagues to consider, if they were at a company, \nsay, that was developing microprocessors, and one of their competitors \nwas being given a subsidy by the Federal Government to do the same \nthing, would you think that was fair? If you were developing heating \nequipment and one of your competitors was being given a product \ndevelopment subsidy by the Federal Government, would you think that was \nfair?\n  This distorts the marketplace. It is simply not a good use of \ntaxpayer money, but we only scale it back to the extent that all \ncurrent obligations continue to be met.\n\n[[Page S9800]]\n\n  I think this is fair, it is the right thing to do, and I ask my \ncolleagues to support the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                            notice of intent\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have exerted very \n     large demands on the Treasury of the United States and \n     required tremendous sacrifice by the members of the Armed \n     Forces of the United States.\n       (2) Congress has a constitutional responsibility to ensure \n     comprehensive oversight of the expenditure of United States \n     Government funds.\n       (3) Waste and corporate abuse of United States Government \n     resources are particularly unacceptable and reprehensible \n     during times of war.\n       (4) The magnitude of the funds involved in the \n     reconstruction of Afghanistan and Iraq and the war on \n     terrorism, together with the speed with which these funds \n     have been committed, presents a challenge to the effective \n     performance of the traditional oversight function of Congress \n     and the auditing functions of the executive branch.\n       (5) The Senate Special Committee to Investigate the \n     National Defense Program, popularly know as the Truman \n     Committee, which was established during World War II, offers \n     a constructive precedent for bipartisan oversight of wartime \n     contracting that can also be extended to wartime and postwar \n     reconstruction activities.\n       (6) The Truman Committee is credited with an extremely \n     successful investigative effort, performance of a significant \n     public education role, and achievement of fiscal savings \n     measured in the billions of dollars.\n       (7) The public has a right to expect that taxpayer \n     resources will be carefully disbursed and honestly spent.\n\n     SEC. __02.

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S9803]]\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Hurricane Katrina\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I want to join my colleagues and all \nAmericans in offering my condolences and my prayers to the residents of \nthe gulf region. These families have suffered grievously. They have \nlost all of their possessions. They are without homes, without \nemployment. We owe them a great deal of support and consideration, and, \nindeed, as I say again, all our prayers.\n  As news reports show, there are heroes throughout the gulf--those who \nhelped neighbors survive the hurricane and those who continue to work \nin the region to help reunite families and restore order.\n  Americans throughout the Nation are opening their homes to hurricane \nsurvivors and volunteering their time and resources to meet the needs \nof evacuees. But while this disaster shows the best that America can \noffer, it also shows the worst. It shows that the Federal bureaucracy \nis ill prepared to respond to a natural catastrophe that we knew was \npossible. It shows the Federal bureaucracy ill prepared to respond to \nfuture potential disasters.\n  It shows a government so tied up in red tape that it is not serving \nits people at their time of need.\n  In the days, weeks, and months ahead, we will be investigating what \nwent wrong, and there will be plenty of blame to pass around, but we \ncannot blame the victims of this tragedy as some have chosen to do. \nMany families in the gulf region did not have the resources or means to \nleave before Hurricane Katrina struck because this administration's \neconomic policy favored tax cuts for the wealthy over programs that \nprovide economic opportunities for all Americans. Over the last 3 \nyears, poverty has risen in America and the real median income of \nworkers stagnated. We must be willing to look honestly at how budget \ndecisions and tax policy at Federal, State, and local level left New \nOrleans residents and other communities vulnerable to this tragedy. We \nmust look honestly at how these policies continue to leave millions of \nAmericans vulnerable across the Nation.\n  Hurricane Katrina demonstrated the economic, social, and racial \ndivides that exists in America. As a Nation we must step back and \nevaluate our priorities. In my judgment, now is not the time to cut \nfunding for social programs such as Medicaid, food stamps, and \ncommunity development block grants while the administration pushes to \nrepeal the estate tax. Now is not the time to continue to provide \ncorporate tax breaks, while we must help rebuild a region in the midst \nof massive deficits as a result of the administration's policies. The \ndamage to the national economy wrought by Hurricane Katrina, the \nexpense to rebuild, and the need to provide for low-income and working \nfamilies in light of this disaster will add to our growing debt. We \nmust prioritize and deal with the needs of the most vulnerable among \nus.\n  For decades, we have known that New Orleans is in harm's way. Senator \nLandrieu has often spoken passionately about the Federal Government's \nduty to help protect wetlands in order to safeguard coastal states. \nYet, we continued to allow coastal wetlands to degrade and cut funding \nto vital programs to protect these natural buffers as well as man-made \nlevees to protect New Orleans. The flood waters from the city of New \nOrleans must be drained in an expedient fashion. However, we must not \nignore the environmental impact that these heavily contaminated waters \nwill have on the long-term public and environmental health of the city.\n  The stagnant waters engulfing New Orleans for the past week contain a \nmyriad of contaminants, including human waste, oil, and even dead \nbodies. This toxic mixing bowl is rife with disease and harmful \nchemicals. We are facing a potential ecological disaster as these flood \nwaters continue to be dumped into the surrounding area, and I am \ngreatly concerned that the impact will be seen for years to come. New \nOrleans is surrounded by Lake Pontchartrain, the Mississippi River, and \nmany precious wetlands. All of these bodies of water drain directly \ninto the Gulf of Mexico.\n  Now is the time not only to evaluate, but also to act to prevent \nfurther ecological damage in the region. More must be done to ensure \nthat while we are clearing the city of New Orleans from this \ndevastating flood, we are also working toward its future rejuvenation.\n  Our primary focus must be on getting rid of the red tape and getting \naid and assistance to those displaced by Hurricane Katrina. But we must \nalso begin to ask how did this happen. The only way to do that \neffectively and apolitically is to have an independent commission to \ninvestigate the long-term impact of Hurricane Katrina on the people of \nthe gulf region and on our Federal Government's response to this \ndisaster as well as our ability to respond to future events. The \nbicameral commission announced yesterday by the Majority Leader and the \nSpeaker is not the answer. Having the President head up a task force to \ninvestigate his Administration's response is not sufficient. The only \nway the people of the gulf region and the people of America will get \nthe answers that they deserve is through an independent commission.\n  I also support efforts to restore the Federal Emergency Management \nAgency, FEMA, to an independent, cabinet-level agency to ensure its \neffectiveness in preparing for and responding to these types of events. \nFEMA's director must have the qualifications and abilities to plan for, \nrespond to, and assist in the recovery after such an emergency. We must \ndo better.\n  As the recovery efforts for the victims of Hurricane Katrina \ncontinue, we must stand beside the survivors to provide relief and \nassistance for their immediate needs now. For this reason, I am \ncosponsoring Senator Reid's Katrina Emergency Relief Act, which will \nhelp get these families by providing medical coverage, housing the \nhomeless, educating children, and offering financial assistance.\n  Hurricane Katrina upset the lives of millions, displacing families \nfrom their homes and inflicting severe economic damage. Neighborhoods \nthat were once called home are now wastelands, and people are concerned \ntheir lives may never be the same. The economic impacts are being felt \nby low-income and working American families throughout the nation. \nIndeed, there is an imminent emergency confronting millions of low-\nincome Americans caused by soaring energy cost and diminishing \naffordability of home heating fuel as winter approaches. The \nadministration cannot ignore this looming crisis. The administration \nmust request emergency funding for the Low Income Home Energy \nAssistance Program so that these families can remain safe this winter. \nI also encourage the administration, and my colleagues, to support \ngreater investment in energy conservation programs such as the \nWeatherization Assistance Program and the State Energy Program to help \nfamilies.\n  In one way, Hurricane Katrina holds parallels to other situations. We \ncould have anticipated this phenomenon. The reports of the class V \nhurricane were available to all Federal officials, State officials, and \nlocal officials. We knew the levees in New Orleans were not designed to \nwithstand anything more than a class III. Yet we were not ready. This \nadministration ignored what should have been obvious. We had to be \nready for a severe hurricane with devastating consequences in New \nOrleans. This administration was not.\n  This also speaks to what may happen in the future. This should give \nAmericans pause if they think about another natural disaster and, God \nforbid, perhaps an intentional mass-casualty effect in the United \nStates. If we bring this same level of expertise and skill and insight, \nthen we surely will see another major disaster on our hands. I hope we \ndo not. That is why it is important to look carefully and closely at \nwhat transpired and to do so through an independent commission. I hope \nwe learn from this and apply it to the future, but most particularly, I \nhope we give real, immediate, and effective support to hundreds of \nthousands, perhaps even a million Americans who tonight still endure \nthe devastation of Hurricane Katrina.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to engage in a colloquy with \nthe\n\n[[Page S9804]]\n\nchairman and ranking member of the Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice \nand Science on funding for SCAAP, the State Criminal Alien Assistance \nProgram. I also understand my colleague from Texas, Senator Hutchison, \nwould also like to discuss the importance of this program to her State.\n  I begin by thanking the chairman, Chairman Shelby, and the ranking \nmember, Senator Mikulski, for including $200 million in funding for \nthis program, with a carve-out of $30 million for the Southwest Border \nProsecution Program. That is good. The problem is, it is not enough. \nWith the rising costs associated with criminal alien incarceration, I \nhad hoped the Senate would see fit to increase the funding for this \nprogram over last year's allocation of $305 million. Instead, it is \ndown to $200 million, with $30 million reserved for the prosecutor's \nprogram.\n  Immigration policy and control of our borders is an exclusively \nFederal responsibility. We all know this. Yet in our State prisons and \nour county jails, there is an incurrence of very heavy costs in \nincarcerating undocumented criminal aliens. Taxpayers should not have \nto foot the bill for incarcerating illegal aliens convicted of criminal \noffenses who are in State and local jails.\n  There is a growing belief among many in this country that the \nimmigration situation is out of control. This year, the Pew Hispanic \nCenter released a study which shows that between 2000 and 2004, \napproximately 3.1 million individuals entered the country without \nproper authorization. That is approximately 700,000 a year. Compare \nthat to the fact that in 2003, Border Patrol agents apprehended \nsomewhat over 1 million individuals seeking to enter the country \nillegally. It is said that for every one individual caught, three more \nenter illegally. If that is the case, nearly 3 million seek to enter \nthe country illegally in a given year.\n  These costs are borne by our local educators, our hospitals, and our \nlaw enforcement officials. Let me use California as an example. This is \nbased on a comprehensive study conducted by the Department of Finance. \nThey estimate--and this goes back to costs in 1994-1995--$400 million \nfor corrections for 23,000 individuals; $400 million for 390,000 \npatients; and $1.7 billion for K-12 education. That is a total of $2.5 \nbillion.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Certainly.\n  Mr. REID. We have a unanimous consent request to be offered on the \nemergency supplemental. We will return as soon as this is offered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n\n                 Unanimous Consent Agreement--H.R. 3673\n\n  Mr. FRIST. We will be very brief. I appreciate the consideration of \nthe distinguished Senator from California.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now proceed to \nthe immediate consideration of H.R. 3673, the supplemental \nappropriations bill from the House, with 90 minutes of debate equally \ndivided, with 30 minutes from the majority side under the control of \nSenator Coburn, with no amendments being in order. I further ask \nconsent that following the use or yielding back of the time, the bill \nbe read a third time and the Senate proceed to a vote on passage \nwithout any intervening action or debate.\n  Let me modify this. We will proceed to the immediate consideration of \nH.R. 3673 immediately following the statement by the Senator from \nCalifornia and the Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, I am wondering if the two \ndistinguished Senators from California and Texas could give us an \nindication--there are Members wanting to know when we will vote--as to \nhow much time they will require.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I have a very short time. We will wrap this up in 10 \nminutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I am happy for you to start the time running right \nnow and give us the first 5 minutes to finish this colloquy.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could, on the Democratic side the time \nwill be divided in the following manner: Senator Byrd, 15 minutes; \nSenator Reid of Nevada, 10 minutes; Senator Kennedy, 5 minutes; Senator \nDurbin, 5 minutes; and Senator Clinton, 10 minutes. That uses our 45 \nminutes.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask the unanimous consent request as \npropounded follow the completion of the statement by the Senator from \nCalifornia and the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thune). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader and the \nDemocratic leader.\n  To give a couple of recent statistics, the General Accountability \nOffice conducted a study of those criminal aliens incarcerated in \nFederal, State, and local prisons. They found the following regarding \nState jails: In fiscal year 2003, 47 States received reimbursement for \nincarcerating 74,000 criminal aliens. Four States alone spent a total \nof $1.6 billion in fiscal years 2002 and 2003 to incarcerate criminal \naliens. Yet they were only reimbursed $233 million through this \nprogram. That is only 15 percent of the total spent by these States. So \nthe Federal Government is only reimbursing States 15 percent of what \nthey actually spend on incarceration costs. That is local costs, that \nis State costs.\n  I can go on, but I want my colleagues to understand that the \ndiversion of dollars from agencies such as the Los Angeles County \nSheriff's Department to house criminal aliens has real operational \nimpact on their law enforcement activities--fighting drugs, street \ngangs, and other pressing law enforcement operations.\n\n  On March 17 of this year, the Senate agreed to a sense-of-the-Senate \namendment to the budget resolution that SCAAP should be appropriated at \na level of $750 million. While I recognize we cannot reach that number, \nthe House bill does provide $405 million for this program. As this bill \nmoves forward, I hope we will agree to the House funding level in \nconference. I ask the chairman and the ranking member to work with us \non this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank my good friend and colleague \nfrom California, Senator Feinstein, for bringing this issue forward \nagain. She has been dedicated to SCAAP funding.\n  I want to also mention Senator Jon Kyl from Arizona who has always \nstepped in when we had an appropriations bill to make sure our States \ngot some reimbursement for their costs of incarcerating illegal aliens. \nUnfortunately, as Senator Feinstein has said, we have more and more \nillegal aliens coming into our country and, unfortunately, committing \ncrimes.\n  This is a Federal responsibility. The counties along the border \nStates should not have to fund what is a Federal responsibility. \nIncarcerating illegal aliens for criminal activities is absolutely a \nFederal responsibility. So I join my colleague, Senator Feinstein, in \nurging the chairman and ranking member of this subcommittee to accept \nthe House position when we go to conference. Mr. President, $200 \nmillion does not cover a 10th of the cost to the border States in \nreimbursing them for the incarceration of criminal aliens. And $400 \nmillion goes a much longer way. I think it is a minimum.\n  All of us realize that illegal immigration must be stopped in our \ncountry. We must know who is in our country for security purposes, and \nwe must be able to deport or incarcerate people who are here illegally \nand commit crimes in our country.\n  I hope the committee chairman and ranking member will work with us to \nincrease the number from the Senate position of $200 million to the \nHouse position of $400 million, at a minimum. I thank the Senator from \nCalifornia for bringing this forward once again.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas. I also \nacknowledge as well Senator Kyl's work in this area. It seems to me \nthose of us from the Southwest or whose borders are in the Southwest \nhave been beating this drum year after year. Sometimes we make a little \nbit of progress, but very often we do not. This is a very bad year in \nterms of the amount and the need.\n  So I thank the distinguished chairman of the Military Construction \nSubcommittee. I always appreciate working with her, and this is one \nmore instance of that.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S9805]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/08/senate-section/article/S9805-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9805-S9813]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n          MAKING FURTHER EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nconsider H.R. 3673, which the clerk will report by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3673) making further emergency supplemental \n     appropriations to meet immediate needs arising from the \n     consequences of Hurricane Katrina, for the fiscal year ending \n     September 30, 2005, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I yield myself time as necessary for my \nstatement.\n  Mr. President, we do turn to the second supplemental--the second \nsupplemental in a week and a half--to address the natural disaster we \nhave watched unfold, and that has literally unfolded in several ways, \nwhich is continuing now with both continued recovery and people \nsettling around this country.\n  Yesterday, Speaker Hastert and I announced the formation of a \nbicameral and bipartisan committee to analyze and conduct a real top-\nto-bottom investigation of the emergency preparation and response to \nHurricane Katrina. The committee will be made up of senior Members. \nThey will report their findings no later than February 15.\n  The review will look at the emergency plans that were in place at the \nlocal, State, and Federal levels, and they will assess how the local, \nState, and Federal governments actually responded.\n  It is clear that in some places the response was simply unacceptable \nat all levels of breakdown in systems. I saw it this weekend firsthand \nas a medical volunteer: too little command-and-control structure, too \nlittle communication. America deserves better. America deserves \nanswers. The Senate must do all it can--and we are doing all we can \nright now--to provide immediate relief for the hundreds of thousands of \npeople stranded and shattered by last week's events.\n\n  We urgently need to pass a second disaster relief supplemental, and \nwe will do that tonight, with no amendments, no delay. It is absolutely \ncritical.\n  Last Thursday's $10.5 billion emergency package has been drained--\ntotally drained. As of midnight tonight, all of the money will have \nbeen spent. And it is good. It shows a positive, rapid, quick response \non behalf of our Federal Government. But it means we must act; thus \nthis supplemental bill we will be voting on here in about 90 minutes.\n  If we were to fail to act, every relief that is going on right this \nvery moment, every search-and-rescue operation, all of the emergency \nfood that is being delivered, and the shelter that is being provided, \nand the medical care that is being extended, will be without money when \nthe sun rises tomorrow.\n  The administration has requested $51.8 billion in this supplemental. \nThat breaks down to $50 billion for FEMA, $1.4 billion for the Defense \nDepartment, and $400 million for the Army Corps of Engineers.\n  We need to pass this bill and get it to the President for his \nsignature tonight. Tens of thousands of volunteers, relief workers, law \nenforcement and military personnel are working right now, this very \nminute, to provide aid, rescue, and recovery.\n  National guardsmen are going block by submerged block to carry out \ntheir rescues.\n  The Army Corps of Engineers is hard at work pumping the floodwaters \nout of New Orleans. The water level, happily, has already gone down by \n40 percent. They estimate it will take another 2\\1/2\\ months to \ncompletely drain the city.\n  Right now, 60,000 U.S. military forces are on the ground in Alabama, \nLouisiana, and Mississippi, aiding the recovery. They are providing \nextensive search and rescue, evacuation, and medical support.\n  Twenty-seven Navy and Coast Guard ships are stationed off the gulf \ncoast providing supplies and medical treatment.\n  FEMA is working around the clock to find temporary homes for the \nthousands of displaced families. They are exhausting every option, \nincluding military bases, cruise ships, emergency trailers, vacant \nproperties, and motels.\n  All of these efforts are underway, and they must continue. The lives \nof hundreds of thousands of people are at stake.\n  Meanwhile, there is still a lot of work to do, and we are working \naround the clock to do it here in the Senate.\n  Today, we began consideration of the Commerce, Justice, Science \nappropriations bill, which includes critical support for recovery and \nrebuilding efforts. It provides funding for the disaster loan program \nadministered by the Small Business Administration. It provides grants \nto State and local authorities, including law enforcement, for critical \nequipment such as satellite phones, which are especially critical right \nnow where communication is spotty and, in places, where sometimes \ncommunication is even nonexistent.\n  The Commerce bill also supports the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration, NOAA. NOAA is responsible, as we all know, for \nresearching, forecasting, monitoring, and warning the public of \nhurricanes such as Hurricane Katrina.\n  Clearly, we need to pass this bill. We also need to cut the redtape \nand bureaucracy that gets in the way of helping people, the redtape and \nbureaucracy we have heard again and again slowing the response at every \nlevel.\n  In the coming days and weeks we will take up legislation that \nstreamlines the system and gets help to the people who need it on time, \nefficiently and quickly.\n  As we have seen over the past 12 days, America is a compassionate, \ngenerous Nation. People from all over have poured out their hearts, \ntime, and resources to help their neighbors on the gulf coast. Private \ncitizens and businesses have donated hundreds of millions of dollars. \nRelief organizations and faith-based organizations are on the front \nlines every day working valiantly to provide material and spiritual \nassistance.\n  Here in the Senate, we cleared a resolution last night allowing \nnoncash Katrina assistance to be solicited and donated among our Senate \nemployees.\n  Americans from all across this country and in all walks of life are \noffering hope and love and compassion. It is a testament to our \nNation's strength and to our historic bond as citizens, as Americans.\n  Hurricane Katrina now stands as the worst natural disaster in our \nNation's history. It is a tragedy of epic proportions. But there is \nhope and there is determination.\n  The gulf coast will recover and rebuild and emerge more modern and \nmore prosperous than ever. It is going to be a massive effort. It will \ntake all of our strength and all of our determination. But this is \nAmerica, and in America no challenge is too great. We rebuilt Chicago. \nWe rebuilt San Francisco. New Orleans, Biloxi, Mobile, and the entire \ncoast will rise again bigger, stronger, and better than ever.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, Senators are aware that the bill that has \ncome over from the House carries additional appropriations for the \nDepartment of Homeland Security for disaster relief in the amount of \n$50 billion; and for the Department of Defense, $1.4 billion; and for \nthe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, $400 million.\n  The House has adopted this measure, and now we are hopeful the Senate \nwill act tonight so these funds will be made available immediately to \nthe agencies that are carrying out the disaster relief efforts in the \nStates affected by Hurricane Katrina.\n  This is a destructive force of monumental proportions, the most \nwidespread destruction in my State from any natural disaster in \nhistory. So the relief being provided now by the Federal Government \nagencies is very meaningful and deeply appreciated. So are the \nvoluntary contributions that are being made by Americans who are \nfreely, and in a heartfelt way, giving what they can to help those who \nare less fortunate.\n  Senators are volunteering personal assistance. The Senator from \nIllinois, Barack Obama, is organizing a team of doctors to come to \nMississippi to provide emergency medical care for those who are still \nin need of that care. Medicines are being brought with those physicians \nto be administered to those who\n\n[[Page S9806]]\n\nneed them. That is one example. There are many others.\n  Members of Congress are raising money on their own volition and then \nturning it over to the fund that has been started by Governor Haley \nBarbour in our State, to collect donations from people who want to help \nvictims, to be used in humanitarian ways, to help people who are in a \ndesperate situation, with no housing, no clothing, no food, many of \nwhom are very poor.\n  So it is heartwarming to witness this. I express personally my \nappreciation for all of those who have acted so generously on behalf of \nthe victims of this hurricane.\n  We have other Senators who have asked for time to speak on this \nmeasure tonight. I know the distinguished Senator from West Virginia \nhas time reserved under the order and the understanding for proceeding \non this bill. I am happy to yield the floor to him for any comments he \nwould like to make at this time, if he chooses to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, Hurricane Katrina dealt this country an \nunspeakable blow. Tens of thousands of homes have been destroyed. \nFamilies have lost everything. Entire cities have been washed away. \nAnd, most tragically, hundreds, perhaps thousands of lives have been \nlost. Our Gulf States are in crisis. People have been scattered to \ncities and homes across the country, as the Army Corps of Engineers \ncontinues to pump the water out of the flood zones. It will take weeks, \nif not months, for the waters to recede.\n  The Congress has responded. Last week, the Congress approved $10.5 \nbillion in emergency supplemental funding. And now we are poised to \nprovide another $51.8 billion. This funding is likely just a down \npayment.\n  The bill that is before the Senate provides $50 billion for FEMA \nDisaster Relief. This funding will provide food, water, housing and \ncash assistance to the victims of Hurricane Katrina. It also will be \nused to reimburse the many Federal agencies that are in the region \nproviding health care, rebuilding roads, providing security and \nremoving debris. The bill also includes $1.4 billion for the Department \nof Defense for the deployment of military personnel to provide relief \nsupplies, health care, and security, and for repairing facilities. \nFinally, the bill includes $400 million for the Corps of Engineers for \nemergency repairs to levees and pump stations, and for draining flooded \nareas. The White House expects that there will be a need for more \nfunding in early October.\n  Congress responded to the President's first supplemental request in \none day because FEMA was about to run out of disaster relief funds. \nCongress approved the President's $10.5 billion request without \namendment. Yesterday afternoon, we received the President's second \nsupplemental request, for $51.8 billion, once again because FEMA is \nexpected to need more money. Today, because of the urgency, we are \napproving his second request. I understand that the President intends \nto send a third request, which will be more comprehensive. Yet, the \nadministration has not made any commitment to send that request to the \nCongress quickly. The White House should not, once again, send that \nrequest one day before FEMA runs out of money and expect the Congress \nto rubber stamp the request. I hope the majority leader will work with \nthe White House to make sure that the request is sent quickly so that \nCongress can debate the matter. As Senator Reid, Senator Landrieu, and \nothers have pointed out, there are many issues about the Federal \nresponse to Hurricane Katrina that should be examined.\n  As we move forward, we must ask serious questions about the \nGovernment's failure to help the people of the Gulf States on a timely \nbasis. We want answers--we all want answers--as to why it took so long \nfor rescue teams to get on the ground. There is no excuse for the days \nof delay and the inexplicable lack of coordination in the response \neffort. The anger and frustration in our country are justified.\n  Was the slow response because our resources were committed overseas? \nWere lives lost because the Government took its eyes away from the \ndanger? Or because it failed to recognize a danger at all? That's one \nof the issues that most concerns me. We all watched the weather radar \nand saw this storm. Its footprint covered the entire Gulf of Mexico. We \nknew the storm was coming. We knew the danger was coming. Yet, the \nGovernment failed to respond. Lives were lost because the Government \nfailed to do its job.\n  What would have happened if this had been a terrorist attack that we \ndid not see coming? What if a surprise attack breached the levees \naround Lake Pontchartrain? How slow would our response have been then, \nto a danger that the Government did not see coming?\n  The Government clearly was not ready to evacuate large numbers of \nlow-income, disabled and elderly people. Not all people in this country \nhave jets, helicopters and fleets of SUVs to move them around. If there \nwere a terrorist attack, would our Government, once again, leave behind \nthe many people in this Nation who do not have the resources to be \nmobile?\n  It's time that we put America first. It's time that we refocus our \nenergies and our resources into protecting this Nation here at home. \nReinforce our critical infrastructure. Train and coordinate response \nand rescue efforts. Close the gaps. Fix the problems.\n  The Government's actions in the days following the tragedy were slow \nand misguided at best, and inept at worst. The Federal response effort \nwas unacceptable, and the Government must do better. Let us pray that \nthis funding will help to save lives and ease the suffering.\n  I urge Senators to support this supplemental appropriations bill. \nHurricane Katrina is a national disaster. It is a national tragedy. And \nit will take a national effort to help our fellow citizens rebuild \ntheir homes, their cities, and their lives.\n  I thank my distinguished colleague, chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, Mr. Cochran, for his contribution. May I say to him, I have \npersonally been concerned about him, his people in Mississippi, his \npeople and Senator Lott's people. I called him and told him that I \nwanted to be of assistance, if I could be, and that any appropriations \nbill that we might appropriate, might send from our committee would \nhave my support. We did this promptly. We are going to continue to do \nwhat we can. I commiserate with him as to the tragedy which has \nbefallen his State, his people, our country, our people.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am deeply grateful to the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia for his kind remarks and his cooperation and \npresentation of this bill and support of the first supplemental \nappropriations bill, as well as providing funding to try to help the \ndisaster victims in my State and the other coastal States that were \naffected by this terrible tragedy.\n  I have admired my friend from West Virginia from the moment I came to \nthe Senate. I respect his dedication to the Senate and his \nconscientious efforts to effectively represent the State of West \nVirginia in the U.S. Senate. I have learned a lot from him, and I \ncontinue to do so as time goes on.\n  One of the things that has not been as widely noted, I think, as \nshould have been is the leadership provided in the gulf coast areas by \nthe local elected leaders. The Governor of my State, Haley Barbour, has \nshown an enormous amount of skill, compassion, and determination to use \nall of the available resources of our State Government to aid the \ndisaster victims, to get them to safety, to provide for them, to help \nin the debris removal, getting businesses started again and the schools \ngoing. It has been a challenge of enormous proportions.\n  I was able to visit with him and his team that he had assembled at \nthe Mississippi Emergency Management Offices on Riverside Drive in \nJackson, MS, on my first visit to the State after the hurricane, and I \nwas very impressed by the dedication, the willingness to work, the \nvoluntarism that was apparent on that occasion and to see the results \nthat are being produced by the local leaders in my State to ensure the \nrecovery from this disaster. So they are to be commended. We are going \nto continue to support them from the Federal level to the fullest \nextent of our capability and understanding of the needs and how we can \nbest do it.\n\n[[Page S9807]]\n\n  There are safeguards in this bill, Senators should know, to help \nprotect against abuse. There are provisions in the bill requiring the \nCorps of Engineers, the Federal Emergency Management Agency to make \nweekly reports on the obligations of their funds. These can be \nmonitored to ensure that they are consistent with the law and the needs \nof the people who have been affected by this disaster.\n  The Department of Defense is required to report within 5 days of any \ntransfers of funds in this relief effort.\n  In the Federal Emergency Management Agency title, there is $50 \nbillion; $15 million is for the inspector general to conduct audits, as \nauthorized by law, to ensure that the funds are being disbursed as \nauthorized by law and in accordance with the understanding of the needs \nof the people who are affected by this disaster.\n  We do not want waste. We do not want abuse of these programs. We want \nthem to be administered with integrity and an adherence to the \nprinciples of law.\n  I want Senators to understand we are not taking this money and \npouring it out on the ground. We are trying to devise ways to see that \nit gets to the people who need it, who are entitled to it under the \nprovisions of the disaster legislation that we passed in earlier \ndisasters.\n  Mr. President, I know other Senators have asked for recognition. I \nsee my colleague on the floor, Senator Lott, who personally has \nsuffered tremendous damage and loss of his home on the gulf coast, who \nhas worked tirelessly--I have observed it--on the phones, traveling \nback and forth from the State, interacting with Members of the House to \nhelp shape this legislation so it provides meaningful relief not only \nfor the victims in our State but throughout the gulf coast region.\n  I commend him and salute him and want him to know we are standing \nwith him and trying to provide all the support and assistance we know \nhow to provide to help overcome the ravages of this hurricane.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I inquire of my distinguished colleague, the \nsenior Senator from Mississippi, has he made other commitments at this \ntime or would it be appropriate for me to make my remarks?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, it is appropriate for the Senator from \nMississippi to speak. It is appropriate to yield to other Senators, but \nthey are not here at this time.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I wish to say what a pleasure it is to work \nwith my partner, the senior Senator from Mississippi, Mr. Cochran. He \nis always a gentleman and very thorough and capable and competent in \nhis leadership as a legislator and as chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee.\n  I must say, I am quite pleased the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee hails from my State. I thank him for his generosity \npersonally and his comments and all he does to offer comfort on a \npersonal basis.\n  I thank him for leading in this particular effort and moving this \nsupplemental forward. We are both here, but our hearts are in \nMississippi now. We are here because we want to make sure these funds \nare available and that they will get to the people and we will not have \nthe important agencies that are involved run out of money in a day or \ntwo, or three.\n\n  I thank Senator Byrd for calling me last week to check on me. I \ncalled him back and talked with him yesterday. He was very kind and \nvery generous. I want people to know we do check on each other and \ncheck on each other's wives. He has been very generous with that. I \nthank these two men for their leadership, and I thank the Senate for \ntheir personal concerns.\n  A lot of Senators are not just offering concerns, they are offering \nhelp. They are sending truckloads of help. They are making personal \ncontributions to charities. It is very heartwarming on both sides of \nthe aisle.\n  I was pleased to see the House take this matter up promptly and pass \nit overwhelmingly. Over 400 House Members voted for it; 11 voted nay. \nNow we have it, and we have an agreement with the leadership on the \nDemocratic side that we would have a time limit and that we were not \ngoing to have a long amendment process because this money is needed.\n  I want to emphasize to my colleague that we want to make sure this \nmoney gets to the right place, the right people, and in the right way. \nWe will be very careful to make sure these contracts are done properly.\n  I was speaking to the Governor of our State a few minutes ago. They \nare going to be monitoring this very carefully. We have the best \nquality of elected officials in my State we ever had, Democrat and \nRepublican. I believe that. We have leaders up and down the line in the \nState offices, and we have young, dynamic mayors who had their towns \nwiped out. We have old experienced mayors who can pull all the \ncommunities together, and they are doing a wonderful job. Supervisors \nare doing a great job too.\n  We will monitor this very closely. We are not asking for a handout, \nbut we do need help. We need a ``handup.'' We want to get our people \nwhere they at least are safe and secure. Right now health concerns, for \ninstance, are bothering me very greatly. My wife is digging through the \nrubble now. I said: Please don't get cut accidentally, and watch out \nfor snakes. One of the many things that comes with hurricanes, people \ndo not realize, is the snakes blow in, and when the water goes out, \nthey stay. I am nervous with her digging around in our neighborhood \nlooking for some of our things that are left.\n  We are going to need help from HHS to make sure we have medical \nattention, personnel, equipment, chemicals, and drugs to help from the \nMississippi gulf coast right into New Orleans. Of course, they will \nhave a distinctly different problem in New Orleans.\n  A massive effort is underway. I have had people say to me: $1 billion \na day, how could that be? You ought to see what is going on and you \nought to see the need.\n  The Coast Guard has been fantastic. They have saved lives, and they \nare working today. The Corps of Engineers has been working to clear the \nchannels. The Navy has ships in the area. The Iwo Jima is in New \nOrleans. The Bataan and the Truman are off the coast of Mississippi. \nThe USNS Comfort is pulling into the area so we can house personnel, \npeople who need help if the hospitals can't help them, and to give \npeople a place to spend a night inside and get a good meal. This has \nnever been done before, so there is a massive effort.\n  Senator Cochran and I flew from Biloxi, MS, over to New Orleans, and \nthen I came back on a helicopter last Friday. It was similar to being \nin a war zone. Honestly--fires burning, water rising, helicopters \nbringing in injured people. There were helicopters all over the place. \nI was very nervous, quite frankly.\n  The point I am trying to make is, there is a huge effort underway, a \nbig push of supplies, equipment, people who are working to save \npeople's lives to this very day and to give us a chance to get back up \nso we can help people go back to work.\n  It is the worst I have ever seen. For 37 years, I have dealt with \nhurricanes, tornadoes, floods, ice storms, everything but locusts, and \nI am expecting them to arrive very soon. But this beats all I have ever \nseen, and it is going to be so hard to deal with the magnitude of the \ndebris, let alone the human tragedies with which we are going to be \ndealing.\n  We need this help. We need this money. Some people are saying it is \nnot going perfectly well. It never does. I have been through this every \ntime. Every time we have trouble getting temporary housing into the \narea. We have trouble moving them from Georgia, pre-positioned in \nMississippi, so we can get them to the people. We are having that \nproblem now. The size and the magnitude of this disaster is so big that \nthings are not going to happen fast enough, and there are going to be \nproblems and slip-ups.\n  I do not think we should take time to be damning mistakes made last \nweek. I want to know what the problems are today, what is the solution, \nand what actions we are going to take. I am very proud of that.\n\n  I want to also say, yesterday I put a list in the Congressional \nRecord of private companies and organizations that have just gone \nbeyond the call of duty--money, supplies. There are also hundreds of \nheroic acts, humanitarian acts where people went beyond the call\n\n[[Page S9808]]\n\nof duty to save lives to help other people--veterans who were rescued \nfrom the Gulfport VA Hospital, nurses who went without water themselves \nfor 3 days to look after their patients.\n  I am going to put in the Record a whole list of these stories of \ngreat human efforts to help other people, sacrifices that people made, \npeople who loaded up vans and showed up. A woman minister from Illinois \nloaded up a van, hitched to a pickup truck, drove herself to \nMississippi, went to a church parking lot without any prearrangement \nand started distributing supplies. That story will be told a hundred \nand thousands of times over.\n  I want to make the point that this is a lot of money, I know it, and \nI am sorry we have to spend it the way we do. I prefer we not have this \nproblem, but it is there, it is real. This is America. Americans have \nproven over and over again how charitable we are and how we will come \nto the rescue of people when they are in need and when they are hurt.\n  Let me say, too, about my State, I am proud of my State. We have been \nworking and pushing. We are getting the job done. We will come back \nbigger, better, stronger, and we will continue to be an important part \nof this great country and a part of our economy.\n  Mr. President, I know I have used too much time of all other time \nthat has to be yielded, but I thank my colleagues, one and all, for \nthis opportunity to express my feelings. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, every single one of us in this body is \ngoing to support this supplemental appropriation for those who have \nsuffered so much in Mississippi, Alabama, and Louisiana. We will do \neverything we can to help them. I know we will have another \nsupplemental in the near future. I want to make sure that everyone \nrealizes that there are now States that have taken the evacuees and \ndone it with open hearts and open arms. We want to do everything to \nmake them comfortable. That includes educating children. It includes \nmedical care and Medicaid reimbursements that will be necessary.\n  It is my hope that the next supplemental will include help for the \nschool districts that are taking large numbers of these students and \nare not able to absorb all of those costs in a way that would assure \nthat these children, as well as the children who are already in the \nschool district, have the quality education we are all striving to \nhave.\n  As chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Subcommittee of Appropriations, \nI have just seen pictures today of the facilities that have been \ndamaged in Biloxi, MS, and in New Orleans. I know we are going to need \nsupplemental appropriations to begin the process of planning how we \nwill rebuild facilities to serve patients in these areas. I will \ncertainly vote in support of this with total commitment. But I do hope \nthat the next supplemental that goes through will have some of these \nissues that will help the people rather than just the three States that \nhave the infrastructure as well as the people problems. Let us give the \nservices that all of us want to give to them as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, in a few days, on Sunday, we will mark \nthe fourth anniversary of September 11. I remember very well the \nextraordinary support, the kindness, the solidarity, the friendship \nshown by our colleagues toward my State. The Federal response, the \ncongressional actions, matched by the extraordinary generosity of the \nAmerican people made what was the worst manmade disaster in our \nNation's history somewhat bearable because we knew that despite what \nthe terrorists had done, America stood with us.\n  We are now confronting the worst natural disaster in our Nation's \nhistory. On behalf of the people of New York, I publicly express our \nsolidarity, our support, and our friendship. I am very familiar with \nthe gulf coast. I went to Biloxi, MS, and the Mississippi gulf coast as \na teenager. I have had a lot of opportunities to travel through \nMississippi when I lived all those wonderful years in Arkansas. We also \nspent a lot of time in Louisiana. We had friends in Baton Rouge and \nLafayette and lots of friends in New Orleans and surrounding parishes. \nOf course, I have been in Mobile. I have been along the gulf coast of \nAlabama. So I can personally see in my mind's eye what Senators are \nspeaking of.\n  Senator Lott spoke about what happened to Mississippi, and Senator \nCochran spoke about the devastation being greater than anything he had \never seen or experienced. Senator Landrieu and Senator Vitter try to \ndescribe what it is like for everything one knows and everything that \nis familiar to be gone.\n  I imagine those days and nights of friendship and good times that I \nhad the privilege of spending in such a wonderful part of our country. \nSo I am very proud of how America is responding once again. The \ngenerosity of countless Americans--even people far beyond our shores \nwant to contribute to try to help put lives and communities back \ntogether. It is entirely fitting that our Federal Government, that this \nCongress would be acting to pass in an expeditious manner this \nimportant supplemental so that the work of cleanup, recovery, even \nhopefully of rebuilding, can begin. I believe that when we vote, as we \nwill, this evening, it will send a very tangible message that the \nCongress understands and that on behalf of the American people we will \nbe with the people of the gulf coast until they, too, can recover and \nrebuild.\n  Just as we did after 9/11, there are many questions we should be \nanswering. When I was in Houston this past Monday with my husband, \nPresident and Mrs. Bush, and Senator Obama, hundreds of people \nsurrounded us asking questions to which we do not yet know the answers. \nThere is a lot of false information, misinformation about what \nhappened, should have happened, did not happen. People are grabbing at \nwhatever they hear, trying to make sense of a devastating experience \nthat has totally transformed their lives and their futures.\n  I respect the fact that our leaders in the Senate and the House have \ncommenced hearings in the Governmental Affairs Committee and that there \nwas an announcement yesterday about a bicameral effort to try to look \ninto what did happen. But I would respectfully suggest that just as \nwith 9/11, we need an independent commission that will look in depth \nand will bring to that inquiry independent expertise, people who are \nnot elected officials, people who can look with a very cold and calm \neye at the facts and the evidence so that we in the Congress, in the \nexecutive branch and State and local governments and, most importantly, \nthe American public, can have some sense that we understand, so far as \nit is humanly possible, what was done and what could have been done.\n  The reason for the independent commission is not only because I \nbelieve we need to replicate the 9/11 Commission to send a clear \nmessage that we are open to looking anywhere and everywhere to find the \nanswers that the people are demanding but also because we do not have \nthe luxury of having officials in the executive and congressional \nbranch diverting their attention to this inquiry, beginning the process \nof compiling evidence, of interviewing witnesses, of holding hearings. \nWe are now required to focus on the future on behalf of not only the \npeople of the gulf coast but on behalf of our constituents as well. We \nare spending a lot of money and we will be spending a lot more to \nensure that we treat fairly, equitably, and with accountability the \nneeds people have right now and in the months and years ahead.\n  Therefore, I would hope that we will come to a bipartisan agreement \nto establish such a commission, exactly as the 9/11 Commission \nfunctioned, with 10 members, the President appointing the chair, the \nother members being appointed by the Democratic and Republican leaders \nof the House and the Senate, that they will be people of independence \nand integrity, and that they will, in a sense, be the surrogates for \nall Americans as they try to make sense of how could this have \nhappened.\n  I chanced upon a television program the other night that was \nrecounting responses from people around the world--places that know \ntheir fair share of disaster--who were asking: How could this happen in \nthe United States of America? It did not make sense to them. They would \nnot have been surprised if it had happened in some poor country,\n\n[[Page S9809]]\n\nsome country without an elaborate bureaucracy intended to deal with \ndisasters, but they were shocked. They were asking questions. Perhaps \nthe most important reason for us to convene this commission and get it \nworking immediately is because we need these answers to ensure that \nwhatever happens in the future will be better handled.\n  There are lessons for all levels of government, and there are \nprobably lessons for those of us in the Congress. We have no idea what \nMother Nature has in store for us. We are not even at the peak of \nhurricane season yet.\n  I remember going to Homestead, FL, in 1992 to see the impact of \nHurricane Andrew. It was late August, early September, and we were only \non the A's. Hurricane Andrew was an A. We are already to K, and we have \nM and others forming out in the ocean and the gulf. We need these \nanswers to protect ourselves. We need to clear away all of the \nconfusion, the natural tendency of human beings to say: It was not me, \nit was somebody else; oh no, wait, it was somebody else indeed. We need \nto just calmly, dispassionately conduct this investigation as quickly \nas possible to get the answers we need.\n  I do not think there is any doubt any longer that the Department of \nHomeland Security, for understandable reasons that I certainly, as a \nSenator from New York, understand and appreciate, turned much of its \nattention to the war against terrorism. People drilled, people met, \npeople worried about a bioterrorist attack, a chemical attack, a \nradiological or, heaven forbid, a nuclear attack. But in the meantime, \nwe have to worry about natural disasters, too, which we have just seen. \nThere were thousands--millions--of people who had to be evacuated. \nPeople lost everything. Businesses are gone. It is certainly fair to \nsay that it will have a devastating effect on the gulf coast, but it \nwill ripple through the economy as well.\n  So I would hope that I would find support in the days to come for the \nbill I have introduced, the Katrina Commission bill. I have also \noffered it as an amendment to Commerce-Justice-State, but that we could \ncome to a nonpartisan agreement to do this piece of the people's \nbusiness, to answer the questions and to make sure this never happens \nagain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  If no one yields time, the time will be charged to all parties.\n  The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, under the order, there was 30 minutes \nreserved for the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma. All of the time \non our side on this bill has been used. His is the only time available \non our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I believe under the agreement that I have \nbeen allocated 5 minutes; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair.\n  First, I wish to mention to our Senate colleagues that of the $51 \nbillion we are considering on the supplemental, there is no funding for \neducation. Under the leadership of Senator Enzi, our committee has had \n2 days of hearings with leaders from Louisiana and from the gulf area \nabout what is happening in the education system and the important need \nto give help and assistance to local communities, not only in those \nareas but also that have taken students across this country.\n  I talked to the Secretary of Education this afternoon, and she \nindicated that she had submitted to the President a series of \nrecommendations that she hopes we can act on in the next very few days, \nand I hope that will be the case. Otherwise, I think we are missing an \nextremely important opportunity to try to provide help and assistance \nin an area of enormous importance to families. There are--85,000 \nstudents in the public schools in New Orleans who have lost their \neducation, 35,000 or 40,000 in private schools, and the list goes on.\n  The second point is I heard that the President had now waived the \nDavis-Bacon provisions in terms of construction. I am not going to \nspend a great deal of time on the Davis-Bacon provisions, but I believe \nit is a great mistake. What we have seen time in and time out when we \nhave debated this issue, this is about quality and the deliverance on \ntime to meet construction requirements.\n  I am deeply disappointed that President Bush has decided to suspend \nwage protections in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. Many people harmed \nby Hurricane Katrina were already struggling to make ends meet, and the \njobs and businesses they relied on have disappeared. Experts have said \nthat as many as 1 million workers may become unemployed as a result of \nthe hurricane, with the unemployment rate reaching 25 percent or higher \nin the gulf region. Many affected workers will be unemployed for 9 \nmonths or longer.\n  One of the major opportunities for work will be in the recovery and \nrebuilding of the area. We need to be sure that these new jobs pay \ndecent wages. This is all that Davis-Bacon does: it simply ensures that \nworkers on Federal Government projects earn a typical wage. The whole \npurpose of this law is to ensure that Federal funds do not undermine \nlocal labor markets by driving down wages.\n  Workers who take these jobs will already face special hazards. We \nheard just yesterday that according to this administration, the \nfloodwaters in New Orleans contain e.coli that is ten-times higher than \nacceptable safety limits. We cannot allow Federal funds to undercut \nthese workers' condition even further by lowering wage rates. But the \nPresident apparently believes that workers in Louisiana, Mississippi, \nand Alabama don't even deserve to earn a decent wage for a day's work.\n  Opponents of Davis-Bacon would have you believe that its wages are \nexorbitant. Nothing could be further from the truth. Indeed, in areas \naffected by Katrina, some typical wages include:\n\n       $9.16 per hour for sheet metal workers in Pearl River \n     County, MS;\n       $10 per hour for laborers in Livingston Parish, LA;\n       $8.54 hour for truckdrivers in Mobile County, AL\n\n  Haven't these workers and their families suffered enough? We are \nproviding tens of billions of dollars in relief, and we should be sure \nthat it goes toward decent wages for workers as they work to rebuild \nthe vital infrastructure that is so desperately needed. We have had \nthose protections so we have had quality. One of the things the \nAmerican people are very concerned about is shabby work. That is \ncertainly true about the people whose family houses are going to be \nrebuilt and buildings going to be restored. They deserve the best. One \nof the best ways is to make sure we are going to have the skilled \npersonnel to be able to do it. I regret the President's decision.\n\n  On a final point, we find now that we have appropriated some $10.5 \nbillion previously and now $51.5 billion this evening. Those funds will \ngo through existing institutions, through FEMA, through Homeland \nSecurity. It ought to be understood by the American people that those \nagencies have extremely important functions to provide for our country. \nHomeland Security has to look after the challenges for all of our \nNation. They have to protect from the dangers of terrorism in our ports \nin Seattle, WA, and Boston, MA, and Los Angeles. They have other \nchallenges across this nation. They cannot spend the time, the effort, \nthe energy, the focus just on rebuilding the gulf area.\n  FEMA has 35 different challenges this year that they are going to \nhave to address. They cannot be expected to devote their time, effort, \nand energy just on the gulf development.\n  I think the best way to do that is to follow a past tradition, a \ntradition that goes back to the time of President Coolidge. When we had \nflooding of the Mississippi in the 1920s, what did he do? He selected \nHerbert Hoover to coordinate all of the efforts, to be above the \ndiscord, so to speak; to coordinate efforts to make sure we were going \nto have focus and attention and we were going to bring all the parties \nto the table; to make sure we were going to do this while ensuring the \ngrants, the development, and the investments that were going to be made \nwere going to meet the highest criteria of integrity and would be done \nin the most comprehensive and complete way.\n  This is not only from a construction point of view, an environmental \npoint of view, but also for the restoration of\n\n[[Page S9810]]\n\nthe lives of the people in those areas and to ensure, as we are going \nto rebuild those areas, we are going to make this available to the \npeople in that area so they are going to be part of the reconstruction \nof their lives.\n  This is going to be enormously important. There are going to be \ntraining programs available to them, so they will feel part of this \nwhole reconstruction, which is a key thing to the American family.\n  We are one country. We have one destiny. To make sure we are going to \nhave one country and one destiny and one future, we have to make sure \nwe have the opportunity to have a commission of integrity, made up of \nthe very best of our society, one that ensures the integrity of those \ninvestments and makes sure those people whose lives are so affected, \nwho are uprooted, are going to get the very best. I hope that would be \nan area where we could come together, Republican and Democrat alike, \nand eventually gain support. I know our leader has talked about it, as \nhas Senator Landrieu. I have had the opportunity to talk to other \nSenators about it. Hopefully, we can develop that opportunity to ensure \nthe kind of reconstruction that all Americans want to see.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I was led to believe that I had 5 minutes. \nI don't know if time is controlled?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes 50 seconds.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Close enough.\n  Mr. President, we estimate the cost of Hurricane Katrina could reach \n$150 billion. Some Senators speculate even more. We are passing a \nsecond supplemental appropriations bill which I assume will pass \nunanimously: $51.8 billion on top of $10.5 billion last week and no end \nin sight. This is an enormous responsibility, a responsibility that \nchallenges us in terms of our Nation's budget priorities.\n  Hurricane Katrina has redrawn the map of the gulf coast. It has also \nredrawn the budget in Washington. When we reached an agreement earlier \nthis year on a budget, it was a much different environment. We did not \nanticipate the staggering expenses of Hurricane Katrina. Some did not \nanticipate the continuing costs of the war in Iraq and Afghanistan, \nwhich should never be forgotten. We included in that budget resolution \na proposal for $70 billion in tax cuts, the first time in the history \nof the United States of America we suggested we would make tax cuts in \nthe midst of a war. Usually, a President calls on the Nation to \nsacrifice during a war, to understand that we each have to give a \nlittle to help our troops overseas. This administration suggested the \nopposite. For the most well off in America, we proposed cutting their \ntaxes in the midst of a war and in the face of the largest deficits in \nthe history of the United States of America.\n  That was before hurricane Katrina. The world has changed. The deficit \nfor this year has been estimated to be $331 billion. Can we add $70 \nbillion to that in tax cuts for the wealthiest people in America? Even \nworse, the estimated cumulative deficit over the next 10 years has been \nestimated by the Congressional Budget Office to be $2.1 trillion. This \nis before Katrina--before the tax cuts. Can we afford to add $70 \nbillion in tax cuts, primarily for the wealthiest people in America, to \nthat astounding historic deficit? We cannot. I think most right-\nthinking people on both sides of the aisle now realize that.\n  Let's be clear. The wrong way to attempt to shrink this deficit would \nbe to cut $35 billion in domestic spending, including $10 billion in \ncuts in Medicaid, the health insurance program for those who are \nhomeless now because of Katrina and the most disadvantaged in America.\n  At a time when Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and other Gulf States \nare struggling to help these people in need, and other States such as \nmy own State of Illinois and so many others are reaching out to help \nthem; at a time when public health challenges are reaching epidemic \nproportions; at a time when States are struggling on their own to meet \ntheir budget responsibility, we cannot cut $10 billion in Medicaid \npayments to the States.\n  Thousands of people who did not evacuate New Orleans before the storm \ncouldn't leave the city simply because they couldn't afford to leave. \nAs my colleague, Senator Obama, said so often, they couldn't fill up \nthe SUV with $100 of gas, put in the bottled water and head out with a \ncredit card to a hotel in some other State to wait it out. That was \nimpossible.\n  They faced the reality of poverty and the reality of disaster. We \nhave to face the reality of our budget. Our budget tells us that we \ncannot cut in Homeland Security, we cannot cut in FEMA, we certainly \ncan't cut the safety net that so many Americans rely on.\n  The Homeland Security Department needs more resources than ever, \nparticularly for FEMA, and to restore the confidence in America that \nthis agency is truly prepared for the next disaster, whatever it \nhappens to be--whether it is a natural disaster, God forbid, or a \nterrorist disaster. Our confidence has been shaken in the Department of \nHomeland Security. We believed that we were safe, and in a few hours we \nlearned, with the disaster on the Gulf Coast, that in many ways we are \nnot.\n  We couldn't keep the flood waters out of New Orleans once that \nhurricane had turned. But can we tell America that we are prepared to \nkeep the next flood, the next hurricane, the next disaster from \ncreating what is a shameful situation now facing us across America?\n  This storm should compel us to reexamine our priorities. A budget \ndocument represents a set of moral choices not just fiscal choices. For \nthe past 5 years, we have chosen wealthy persons over working \nAmericans, pharmaceutical companies over seniors, oil companies over \nthe environment, and defense contractors over veterans. It is time to \nchange those priorities.\n  I will vote for this money. I believe all Senators will probably vote \nfor this money to help our victims. But let us be honest about the \nrealities, the budget challenges we face. Let us understand that a tax \nholiday for the wealthiest people in America is not appropriate--not \nthis week, not next week, and not any time this year, as we face the \nreality of a war in Iraq, which continues to claim lives every single \nday, and this catastrophe of Katrina, which is going to test our moral \nfiber.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I thank the leadership for giving me an \nopportunity to talk this evening and to express some views. We heard a \nvery good talk about the budget. The points I was going to make have to \ndo with the disasters we face. It is ``disasters''--it is not one, it \nis two. One is slowly creeping upon us, and the other is right in front \nof us.\n  The tragedy that we see on the gulf coast is something to which we \nhave to attend, something for which we have to supply the funds. It is \nimportant that we offer aid, that we come to the aid of those people. \nOne of the most disheartening things I have seen in the last week-and-\na-half has been finger pointing by politicians at all levels of our \ncountry that benefits no one, accomplishes nothing except to prove to \nthe American people partisanship tends to trump any issue. It is \ndisheartening that we as a body would fall into that, when such great \nresponsibilities are in front of us.\n  I said ``disasters'' because the other disaster we are not looking at \nis the Federal budget that the Senator from Illinois discussed. I take \na very different view. I am disappointed in our President for not \nbringing forward with this bill recommended spending cuts that would \neasily be achieved in the discretionary budget of this country to pay \nfor the disaster assistance. We heard Senator Lott talk about the \nsacrifices of the people, both those who are involved and those who \nhave contributed to help in this tragedy. It is no sacrifice on the \npart of Congress to steal $51.2 billion from our grandchildren to \nsupply the need now without doing the hard work that Americans would \nexpect of us to make sure our priorities are right. It is a time for \nleadership in this country.\n  Our budget deficit, after we pass this bill, will be $670 billion \nthis year. That is the real deficit. That comes to over $2,000 per man, \nwoman, and child in this country this year alone. So we have two \ndisasters. One is that we have chosen political expediency over the\n\n[[Page S9811]]\n\nfuture of our country. The heritage that our country leaves us and has \nbeen given to us is one of sacrifice to preserve the opportunities for \nthe next generation.\n  We are going to do what is right for the people on the gulf coast, I \nhave no doubt. But we are not doing what is right for the generations \nthat are beyond us, for our children and our grandchildren. It takes \ncourage to stand up and say we can do better. We have heard that. But \nwe have not ever talked about how we can do better. We have talked \nabout how agencies can do better. The way we do better is by finally \nstarting to make the hard choices on priorities for our country.\n  The President, in his budget proposal this year, recommend 99 \nprograms to be eliminated that did not meet an assessment rating \nprogram that was developed by OMB. That program was many times agreed \nto by many people in this body. That was $19.6 billion. There is not \nthe courage coming from the executive branch to offer those, to say we \nare not going to spend another $19.6 billion of our grandchildren's \nmoney. Yet we are going to do the easy thing. We should pay for this. \nWe should pass this bill, but we should not pass it on the backs of our \nchildren and our grandchildren.\n  I have a message for Americans out there. We have seen so many great \nefforts at contribution. Oklahoma has 3,800 people from Louisiana now, \nand we are going to love them and care for them and do everything we \ncan to help those individuals in our State. But everybody else in this \ncountry can make a sacrifice, too. There is no charity without \nsacrifice. If it doesn't cost you anything, it is not worth much.\n  What we have to do is look at every level of the Government, every \noperation of the Government, and say: Where can we do better? I have \ntalked to hundreds and hundreds of Federal employees who know where the \nwaste is in their departments and in their agencies. Now is the time to \ncome forward. The doctors in this country, you can save Medicare a ton. \nThe hospitals in this country, you can save Medicare a ton. This year \nalone, trim your bills, cut back 4 or 5 percent. Do what is hard for \nyou but gives benefit to the future. We need to set a standard that we \nare going to do what is right, both in this generation and in the \ngenerations that follow us.\n  We have an oath to uphold the Constitution, but we have a higher \noath, and that higher oath is to keep the obligations that our \nforefathers put forward to create the best, brightest, the country \nproviding the most opportunity of any in the world.\n  We will borrow internationally this year $1.4 trillion. How many \nyears do you think the international financial community will continue \nto allow us to borrow that money without some cost coming home?\n  I believe we should have made the effort to pay for part of this \nsupplemental spending.\n  I believe it is easy for us not to make that effort. I think it is \nvery hard if we choose to make the effort. I believe if we do not step \nup to the responsibilities given to us by not attempting to make us \nbetter, by not attempting to make us more efficient, by not attempting \nto root out the waste--examples: Last year, 2004, the Federal \nGovernment overpaid $41.5 billion for things it bought or handed out. \nThat would almost pay for this bill, if we would eliminate that. We can \neliminate it. We choose not to do the oversight that is necessary to \nfind the problems to make us more efficient, to accomplish the very \ngoals to create the opportunity in the future for the next generation.\n  I will vote for this bill. But I am noticing our Members that we \nshould do better; we should do what is expected of us; we should make \nthe hard choices people expect us to make rather than to go to an \nunending piggy bank of debt and defer those choices to our \ngrandchildren.\n  What does that mean? It means our grandchildren are going to have a \nfar lower standard of living as we try to continue to load this debt on \nthem. That is not opportunity. That is not a heritage I want to be \ninvolved with. I want to follow the heritage of our forefathers and the \ngreat generation of World War II where sacrifice was made.\n  I believe it is incumbent upon us to do better. I challenge every \nMember of this body to start doing the oversight, to find the areas \nwhere we can be better, where we can spend less money now--not because \nit may not be a great project--where we don't spend $26.5 billion in \nearmarks on a highway bill, the New York Times today listed ways we \ncould help pay by eliminating earmarks and pork.\n  I find it ironic that I am agreeing with editorials in the New York \nTimes. But they are right. The American people should demand of us now \nto make the very hard choices of ordering our priorities. Not doing \nthat is below what every individual Member of this body is about.\n  I challenge Members as we look forward to the next supplemental which \nwe consider if there is an area in the Federal Government that isn't \nworking well where we could save money. The assumption on other side of \nthat is the Federal Government is 100-percent efficient. If there is \nnot any place where we can find money to trim to pay for that, that \nmeans the Federal Government is working perfectly. There is not a \nperson in this country who believes that.\n  I know this talk about finding the money falls on deaf ears to many \nMembers of this body. I am not partisan in any way except I am partisan \nfor the future of our country. We cannot continue to live beyond our \nmeans.\n  The individuals out there who sent $20 to the American Red Cross \ndidn't go freely to get $20 to buy the next ice cream cone or go to the \nnext Starbucks. They gave up something to give that money. We need to \nbe doing the same, and hardship is required. We need to stand up--\nDemocrats, Republicans, individuals--and lead on the issue of \nefficiency and accuracy and the ordering of priorities; it is most \nimportant.\n  Is it important right now to spend $200 million on a bridge to 50 \npeople in Alaska? Is that important? Should we be doing that when we \ncould spend $200 million helping people in New Orleans or Mississippi? \nThere isn't going to be anybody except 50 people and two Senators and \none Congressman who thinks that is a good priority. We ought to be \nadjusting what we have done to pay for this.\n  The other final point I would make, it was suggested to the \nadministration and it was rejected, but we need a controller for this \nmoney under the Office of the President to make sure it is spent \nproperly. If we have the legislation that is already authorizing that, \nit is available, it should be put forward. I am going to offer that \nlegislation next week to make sure it is spent right. The President has \nauthorized in good will an inspector general increase to look at it, \nbut they won't be controlling the money. What they do is see how it is \nspent after the fact. We need somebody in charge of spending before it \nis spent to make sure it is a priority before it goes down there, as we \nshould be doing here.\n  I thank the body for the time and the effort. I believe it is \nincumbent on us to secure the future of this country. We can be \ncritical of FEMA, but if we are not critical of our own positions in \nhow we have spent our children's and our grandchildren's future, we \nhave no right to be critical of any other agency of this Federal \nGovernment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on passage of \nthe bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I extend my appreciation to President Bush \nfor making this request that is now before the Senate. It contains \nimportant money for the victims of Katrina, and I will support it. \nHowever, before we vote, my colleagues should know that this bill is \nseriously flawed in several ways.\n  First, all the money for the relief effort--most of the money in the \nbill--goes to FEMA. After what we have witnessed these past 10 days, is \nthere anyone in America who feels we should\n\n[[Page S9812]]\n\ncontinue to rely exclusively on FEMA to head the Federal Government's \nresponse? I think not.\n  Second, the President's request fails to make the substantive changes \nin law necessary to address many of the critical needs of our \nsurvivors--notably health care, housing, education, and financial \nrelief. Victims need this assistance, and they need it now. But this \nlegislation before the Senate tonight makes no such changes. It only \nspends more money.\n  Again, let me be clear. Despite these flaws, my Democratic colleagues \nand I will support this supplemental. We simply must do everything we \ncan for the victims of Katrina.\n  That said, I would like to remind the Senate we cannot rest with the \npassage of this supplemental. There is much more work we need to do, \nand there are dozens of steps the Senate should take quickly to get the \nvictims the relief they need.\n  Along with Senator Landrieu and many of my colleagues today, I \nintroduced legislation called the Katrina Emergency Relief Act that \nmakes the changes in law we need to give survivors the relief they need \nright now.\n  For example, health care. The survivors of Katrina need health \ncoverage. Some of them were already uninsured. Others may have had \ninsurance but they have been relocated miles from home and lost their \ninsurance when they lost their jobs.\n  Here is how the Senate could help. We can ease enrollment into \nMedicaid so that survivors get Medicaid benefits without regard to \nassets and income. These people do not have the necessary documents to \nprove their residency or their needs. But we can make all that \nirrelevant by easing enrollment. We can also assure States that the \nFederal Government will pick up the tab for any health services they \nprovide survivors.\n  Regarding housing, FEMA has estimated that up to 1 million people may \nbe left homeless by Katrina and require housing assistance. Many will \nlack the standard paperwork to apply for Government assistance and will \nface steep rents as affordable housing is already limited for many. Yet \nFEMA is ill-equipped to handle the housing needs of Katrina's victims, \nmany of whom are scattered around the country and will need housing for \nan extended period.\n  Regarding this housing, here is how the Senate can help. We could \nvery easily direct legislatively the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment to provide housing vouchers that survivors can use anywhere \nto get out of shelters and into a home. We have all seen the images of \nfamilies sleeping in the convention center or in the Astrodome, at the \nSuperdome or at our armory here in Washington, DC or in universities in \nNevada or in States all across this country. The Senator from Arkansas \nhas indicated that 60,000 people who are victims of the gulf disaster \nare now in Arkansas. We must help them get off the cots and into real \nhomes.\n\n  About education, the Katrina disaster struck as school was set to \nbegin. Thousands of kids have lost their classrooms. They have lost \ntheir teachers. They have nowhere to go. No student should miss a \nsingle day. Here is how the Senate could help. Again, it is pretty \nsimple. We can give school districts $2,500 for each displaced student \nthey enroll. It will help offset their costs, and it will encourage \nsome of them to open their doors. We have a lot of school districts \nthat are suffering financially. We can help school districts get other \nresources. For example, they need to deal with bigger classes--help \nwith teachers, textbooks, material, and counselors who are badly \nneeded.\n  What about financial assistance? Senator Lieberman has legislation, \nwhich is his part of our package, that shows not only have hundreds of \nthousands of Americans lost their homes but they have lost their jobs \nand their livelihood for now and any time in the near future. It will \ntake time for Americans to get back on their feet. And here is how the \nSenate can help. We can temporarily forgive victims of their financial \nobligations for the Federal Government--things such as student loans \nand Small Business loans. We can help people so they don't lose their \nhomes because they lost their jobs to Katrina and can't make the \npayments. We can extend unemployment insurance for these victims who \nhave lost their jobs through no fault of their own. The joblessness \nrate is expected to increase to 25 percent or higher in the region, and \nwe need to make sure unemployment benefits are available.\n  We can make it easier for victims to use their own savings to get \nback on their feet. Some may have Individual Retirement Accounts which \nthey could draw from at this time, and we can make it easy for them to \naccess money by suspending taxes on such withdrawals.\n  All of these are steps we could have taken today. A number of these \namendments have been presented on the Commerce, State, Justice bill. \nBut there are points of order raised against it because the rules of \nthe Senate are such that you can't have legislation on an \nappropriations bill.\n  We had hoped the Senate would act on these items promptly, and that \nis why we introduced four amendments this afternoon to the Commerce, \nJustice, Science appropriations bill that I have described in some \ndetail. But rather than voting on our efforts, as I have said, the \nmajority plans to raise procedural objections. It is unfortunate. \nVictims of Katrina don't care about the Senate procedures. They just \nknow they need health care, housing, and school for their children--not \nmore Federal redtape.\n  My colleagues and I will continue to fight for these items in the \ndays ahead. People who have lost their jobs and everything they have \never worked for don't care if they get Democratic relief or Republican \nrelief. They want relief, and they want it now.\n  In the days ahead, victims of Katrina and the American people will \nwant something in addition to short-term relief. I think it is \nimportant that we begin to address this. Survivors and the American \npeople will want at least two things--a long-term plan to rebuild the \ngulf coast and answers about why the Government failed them.\n  To rebuild the gulf coast, we need to think about a Marshall plan.\n  I have something I have worked on for a number of years that was \nmoving along very strongly prior to September 11, the American Marshall \nPlan. Remember, for every $1 billion we spend on developing our \ninfrastructure, we create 47,500 jobs. We need a Marshall Plan to \nreconstruct the gulf region, a plan on par with the one we used to \nrebuild Europe after World War II. This is a region rich in culture and \nsteeped in our history. It must be rebuilt, and we need a grand plan to \nrebuild it.\n  While we rebuild the gulf coast, we make sure we do not do it on the \nbacks of American workers. I have been told the President has decided \nto suspend Davis-Bacon, a bill on the books for 60-plus years. It works \nbecause it creates an even playing field for workers. I will object if \nthe President decides to do this. This is a time to work together and \nrestore lives, not to play partisan politics.\n  We also need to find out why the Federal Government failed the people \nof the gulf coast when they needed their Government the most. Following \nSeptember 11, preparedness for national emergencies was supposed to be \na priority for this Government. Americans were made to believe the \nGovernment was doing everything it could to prepare for terrorist \nattacks, natural disasters, and other natural crises. Katrina makes it \nclear that we aren't ready.\n  When we faced a similar situation after September 11, Democrats and \nRepublicans came together and established an independent blue ribbon \ncommission. We now want to do this. We must do this. It will happen. It \nis only a question of when it will happen.\n  I have been told the majority in the Senate and in the House wants a \ndifferent approach. They unveiled, very loosely, a proposal to \ninvestigate the events of last week. They call it a bicameral \ncommittee. Please. We have down at 16th and Pennsylvania Avenue an \nannouncement by the President that he is going to be the leader of the \ninvestigation. We certainly do not need the same thing in the Senate. \nWe have committees of jurisdiction that can do the work, and we must \nhave, as Senator Clinton has proposed, this bipartisan commission. It \nis very important. I support this commission. The victims deserve an \nanswer independent of politics--the kind of answers only an independent \ncommission can deliver.\n\n[[Page S9813]]\n\n  I appreciate the patience of my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Very briefly, Mr. President, this supplemental will be the \nlast vote of the evening and for the week. We will be here tomorrow to \ncontinue business on Commerce-Justice-Science. Amendments can be \noffered either tonight or tomorrow. There will be no rollcall votes \ntomorrow.

We appreciate the prompt action on the President's \nrequest. We thank all Senators for their cooperation in agreeing to the \nexpedited procedure for consideration of the bill today and passing the \nbill. This will get needed relief to the disaster victims in coastal \nStates of Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama, the Gulf Coast, and others \nwho have been injured and victimized by this disaster. We thank the \nleadership for scheduling the bill and for supporting our efforts to \nget the bill done today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to discuss, for a moment on the \nrecord, what I have been telling some Senators individually and in \ngroups about the management of postdisaster activities in the Gulf \nCoast area. Let me begin by saying that I am not going to add to the \nvarious discussions being had about who should decide what persons, if \nany, made mistakes in terms of controlling this disaster, the scourge \nof this hurricane. Did somebody not do what they were supposed to do or \ndid somebody do it too late? If so, who was it, when did the mistake \noccur, and why did the person act as they did? That is, who was at \nfault in responding to this natural disaster, if anyone. I am not \ntalking about that. I hear the rancor and the partisanship in the \ndiscussion about who should do that.\n  I am talking about the fact that we have now the most difficult \nsituation that America on its homeland has ever had to manage. We have \nnever had anything as difficult as this to manage--the confusion, \ndisrepair, individual suffering, displacement, hardship, property \ndestruction, pollution. All of those things affected literally hundreds \nof thousands of people in three-plus States. We are currently in the \nimmediate aftermath of the force that brought all those things upon us \nas a nation.\n  How many people have been displaced--sometimes called refugees, but \nthey will not be referred to as such by me--how many men, women, and \nchildren? I understand that the numbers displaced due to a natural \ndisaster before this did not exceed 30,000. It was something under \n30,000. For this one disaster, there were over 450,000 people \ndisplaced. Anybody who thinks that what we have in place to manage a \ncrisis of this magnitude is fine doesn't understand the proportions of \nthis event. We don't have in place the tools, the wherewithal, the \nability to manage this problem--not from the time of its arrival and \nnot now, as we work to gradually make the situation better for \neverybody, to a point in time that we can take a deep breath and say: \nWe have done as much as we can for as many as we can, and as far as our \ncountry and its people and its businesses and its charities are \nconcerned, we have completed the task of responding to this emergency.\n  We don't have any way of doing that. Anybody who is sitting around \nhere contemplating the work of its committee, be it a chairman of a \ncommittee or the chairman of a subcommittee, and thinking they know how \nto do that, let me tell you, they don't. I regret to say it. In all \ndeference, I am one of those chairmen. I have a standing committee and \na subcommittee. They are both involved in this event. One is Energy and \nNatural Resources. The other is Appropriations for Energy and Water, \nwhich is literally all the energy around there, pipelines and the like, \nand the Corps of Engineers. So I could be saying I will do my share. I \nwill start having hearings. But I submit that this work that I would do \nand that any other committee of the Congress would do is as apt to be \nmeaningless or wrong or moving in the wrong direction, when looked at a \nyear from now, as it is to be appropriate.\n  It isn't that we are doing anything wrong; it is that we don't know \nwhat our goal is. We don't know where we are going. We know people need \nchecks. We know people need money. We know people need accelerated \nSocial Security and Medicaid benefits. We also know people need \nhousing. But does that mean we should hold a hearing in the housing \nAppropriations Committee and decide: Here is a new program. We are \ngoing to fund the program. It will be grants and loans, 100,000 new \nhouses for these people? Of course it doesn't mean that at all.\n  We need somebody to put the plan together and decide what the housing \nsituation is going to be like for these people. Do we need interim \nhelp? Will that be vouchers? And who will start putting that together? \nI could go on. This is not because anybody has not done their job. \nForget about that. Whatever the job that was to be done, right or \nwrong, is finished. What you have to do now is rehabilitate, replan, \nand put in place what must be done within the laws of America, with the \ndollars of our taxpayers.\n\n  I came here in 1972, believe it or not. I was 39 years old. I don't \nknow how I got here or why I was here. I got a great big assignment, \none committee, Public Works. You new Senators who worry about your \ncommittee assignments these days, I only had one. I got\n\n[[Page S9814]]\n\na very auspicious job, too. I was ranking committee member on a \nsubcommittee on disaster relief. I thought: Well, I will never have a \nhearing, but when I have been here long enough, I will go to another \ncommittee.\n  But lo and behold, Agnes hit. Agnes was a giant hurricane that caused \na Northeastern flood, all the way through Pennsylvania. Sure enough, I \nwent to work. I learned about disasters.\n  But what I also learned was that through the good wisdom of a \nSenator, who, as I now understand it, was Hugh Scott, the minority \nleader from Pennsylvania--he used to sit over here when we had very few \nseats on this side of the Aisle--he talked Richard Nixon into \nappointing a man to be in charge of the Agnes recovery named Frank \nCarlucci. You've all heard his name of late. However they found him, I \ndon't know. They must have been clairvoyant; they must have known he \nwas something super. He was President's Nixon's on the ground \nrepresentative for Agnes for 3 or 4 years, and we came out of that. \nToday his job would be comparable to having all involved computers run \nout of one office by people in the executive branch of Government, as \nif the OMB moved over there to handle things. Everything ran according \nto plans that came out of Carlucci's office of recovery. Nixon did not \nuse a Marshall plan. He put somebody in charge of telling us what \nresources we ought to use and what our options were.\n  From that, he went on to other areas of success, so they must have \npicked the right guy. He held two Cabinet positions. He was a great \nsuccess in business. That has nothing to do with what I am talking \nabout, but he was apparently a very talented man. Now this President \nought to pick a very talented leader, someone who is not in the \nGovernment, for a similar task. I mean no offense to the current \nestablishment working in the Gulf Coast. They are there because we had \nan emergency--a disaster. But they are not there to handle what is \ngoing to be about a 10-year recovery program.\n  I think the occupant of the Chair knows this. This recovery plan will \ngo on long beyond the next 2 or 3 years. We better have our recovery \nefforts, and oversight of those efforts, occur in an orderly manner or \ncan you imagine how many hearings we are going to have? Can you imagine \nhow many committees are going to be involved in saying they are solving \nthis problem? Can you imagine the number of press releases that will be \nissued by subcommittees that are holding hearings about fixing this \nthing? Can you imagine the laws they are going to bring down here to \nthe floor to pass saying, we are solving Katrina? All those things \nought to come out of somebody who is on the ground analyzing the \nsituation.\n  I urge the President to act. Give the position whatever name you \nlike. I hate to use the word ``czar''. It doesn't sound right to say \n``commander.'' It doesn't sound right to say ``general.'' But they \nought to put somebody in charge by executive order and give them the \nOMB type of office experts to help them analyze this situation and \npresent to the Congress, through the President, the information we need \nfor us to make the decisions about what policies we want.\n  Far be it from me to know much about managing things because I don't \nmanage much except in my office, and I am not sure sometimes if a \nSenate office is even manageable. Whatever I have to manage, it \nprobably has not been managed very well. Once I thought it was so \nimportant to manage that I hired somebody to see if they could write a \nmanual on how you manage a Senate office. He was the greatest manager I \nhad ever seen in New Mexico. He spent a year and a half working. He \nwrote a manual. When he was finished, he said: I guess I have tell you, \nyou have to make this current about every week because things are so \nchangeable here. So I don't know how to manage things.\n  But what I know is that what we have now cries out for a manager or \nwe are going to have disorder following disaster. We are going to have \nmoney following money and then people asking: What wasn't done that \nshould have been done? The sooner a manager is put in place, the \nbetter. I hope the President will act.\n  I thank the Senate for listening. I thank the Presiding Officer, \nbecause he is the only one who has to stay around here before we \nfinish, and Senator Alexander for being a gentleman.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I am glad I had an opportunity to hear \nthe Senator from New Mexico, who has a lot of wisdom on a lot of \nsubjects. One of the most important things he reminded us of was to try \nto get in concrete terms the immensity of this disaster. We see it on \ntelevision. We know there is more to be done than has been done. We \nknow it is going to last a long time. I heard the same facts he did \ntoday, that the most displaced families that FEMA has ever had in one \nof its disasters was 22,000. This is 400,000 or 450,000 or 500,000. In \nother words, this is 20 times the scale of the worst disaster we have \never had in terms of displaced Americans. And so we are all scrambling. \nI think it is important for the Senator from New Mexico to have brought \nthat up.\n\n  He also heard, as I heard, that one of the last great hurricanes we \nhad was Harvey, I believe. FEMA is just finishing the work on Harvey \nnow 10 years later because it takes a long time to help communities and \npeople get back on their feet. So this is a massive challenge. All of \nus want to help.\n  There is one other thing I am prompted to say before I say a word or \ntwo about higher education and the bill that was reported today by the \nHELP Committee. I have talked a lot in the past about the idea of a \ncitizen legislature. The Senator from New Mexico has as well. Senator \nHoward Baker, who used to be the majority leader, used to talk about \nthe citizen legislature and how valuable it was for our country if \nthose of us who serve here spend a lot of time in our home states, that \nwe spend time at the diner instead of dinner with a lobbyist, that we \nspend time at the church instead of up here at a ball game, that we \nkeep our feet on the ground, and that is very important.\n  I believe that is probably more important today than it has ever been \nbefore. I will give an example. I was about to come back up here after \nour 5-week break. The morning paper reported that an airplane had \narrived from Louisiana with 80 people on it who were in dire straits. \nAl Gore, the former Vice President of the United States from Tennessee, \ngave no interview to anybody, and had nothing to say. It has come out \nsince then that he apparently arranged for the plane and may have paid \nfor it. In other words, he brought them up from New Orleans.\n  I did what other people, I guess, did in our country. Before I came \nback to Washington, I sent a contribution over to the American Red \nCross in Blount County, my home county. These 80 people were brought to \nthe Christian church on Highway 321, where the Red Cross began to try \nto help them in various ways.\n  It never once occurred to me that I might be giving some advantage to \na prominent Democrat by supporting something he was doing to help \npeople. It never occurred to me. I doubt it ever occurred to Vice \nPresident Gore that he was bringing those 80 displaced persons to one \nof the most Republican counties in the United States. We have not had \nan elected Democrat in Congress from our area since the Civil War.\n  So in Maryville, TN, and I am sure in the Commonwealth of Virginia \nand everywhere in this country, the people who sent us here know what \nto do. They are opening their hearts, they are opening their doors, \nthey are opening their churches, and they are opening their \npocketbooks. The furthest thing from their minds is political \nadvantage. I suspect that is exactly how they would like for us to \nconduct ourselves here.\n  It seems to me impossible in this body to avoid partisanship. \nSometimes I think we have a playpen over here and a playpen over here, \nand a few Senators and House Members are always angling for partisan \nadvantage. But this is no time for it. So when those impulses or \noutbursts occur, my suggestion would be that we go home.\n  In my case, it will be Maryville, TN. Most of us go home on the \nweekend or we go home for periods of time. We go down to a shelter, we \ngo down to a church, and we see how the people who sent us here are \nconducting themselves\n\n[[Page S9815]]\n\nin dealing with this tragedy. And we remind ourselves of that, and we \ntake a lesson from them. When we come back up here Monday through \nFriday, then hopefully we would conduct ourselves as well as they are \nconducting themselves. They would expect that from us, and we will do a \nlot better job of helping deal with this immense tragedy, 20 times as \nlarge as anything we have seen before.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/08/senate-section/article/S9815-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9815-S9816]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             FEDERAL SUPPORT FOR COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I wish to say a word about something \nimportant that happened this afternoon that is good news for the men \nand women in this country who go to college.\n  We have the best system of colleges and universities in the world. I \ncan remember Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison from Texas and Senator Frist \narranged for a group of us to meet with the former President of Brazil, \nMr. Cardoso, who had been at the Library of Congress for a while and \nwas going back to Brazil. Senator Hutchison said: Mr. Cardoso, what \nwill you take back to your country about your stay in the United \nStates? He did not hesitate for a moment. He said: Senator Hutchison, \nthe excellence of the American University. He said: There is nothing in \nthe world like it. It is one of the greatest strengths of your country.\n  There are many reasons for this. I believe it is because we have \ncreated an environment in which we can bring out the best. We have \n6,000 autonomous for-profit, nonprofit, State-supported, not-State-\nsupported institutions, and we have generous Federal funding that \nfollows students to the college or university of their choice. That \nmarket environment has permitted us to surpass the world. We do not \njust have some of the best colleges and universities in the world, we \nhave most of them, and several of those are in the home State of the \nPresiding Officer, in Virginia, and some of those are in my State as \nwell.\n  Today the committee upon which the Presiding Officer and I serve, the \nHealth, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, reported out \nlegislation that has to do with Federal support for colleges and \nuniversities for the next 4 or 5 years. The importance of that is this: \n60 percent of the students in our country attending universities, \ncommunity colleges, technical institutes, or for-profit institutions do \nso with the support of Federal grants or Federal loans. Sixty percent \nof the college students are affected by this legislation.\n  While the details of this legislation will come out over the next few \nweeks, it is important to say two things about it. One is the \nremarkably effective job by the Senator from Wyoming and the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts, Senator Enzi and Senator Kennedy. This is a complex \nbill. There are lots of opinions on it. There are more than 20 of us on \nthe committee. At a time of great difficulty around here, they produced \nlegislation that we unanimously supported and agreed upon and will \nbring to the Senate floor. It is almost certain it will go to \nconference with the House of Representatives and result in a final bill \nthat we will then send to the President. It was a first-class job of \nleadership by Senator Enzi and Senator Kennedy, and I salute them for \nit, and I am glad to have been part of their committee.\n  The second thing to say is the bill is good for students. For \nstudents, it increases the amount of Pell Grants from $4,050 to $4,500 \nover 5 years. The bill gives students who want to use their Pell Grant \nduring the summer the opportunity to do so for the first time, making \nPell Grants available year round.\n  We have a lot of working people who go to colleges and universities \ntoday. They may want to go four straight semesters. Right now they \ncannot do that if they are eligible for Federal support. Now they can \nunder this bill when it passes. In addition, Pell Grants will be larger \nfor students who are majoring in math, sciences, or critical foreign \nlanguages, thereby encouraging students to pursue these fields.\n  Someone told me in Tennessee last week that we only had one new \nphysics teacher who graduated and came into our classes. They are going \nsomewhere else. We need more homegrown scientists in the United States, \nand this is one step to help with that.\n  The bill is also good for universities as well as students because it \nbegins to relieve the oppressive paperwork burden the Federal \nGovernment places on colleges and universities, freeing up scarce \ndollars to spend on improving quality teaching, research, and public \nservice rather than paperwork.\n  For example, this legislation creates an expert panel to review, \nevaluate, and streamline the 7,000 Federal regulations that govern \ngrants and loans to college students. I made a speech on the floor of \nthe Senate a few months ago, and I stacked up in several boxes the \n7,000 regulations that every single one of the 6,000 colleges and \nuniversities has to go through before they can admit students with a \nFederal grant or a Federal loan. That is ridiculous. The President of \nStanford said they were spending 7 percent of their tuition on \ncomplying with Federal grants and Federal loans. Universities should be \nable to focus more on teaching and research, and less on complying with \nreporting requirements.\n  In addition, for the first time, the Federal Government will be \nrequired to develop a compliance calendar, making it easier for our \n6,000 colleges and universities to comply with Federal rules and \nhelping them with institutional planning and avoiding inadvertent \nerrors in meeting these requirements. In other words, we are saying to \nthe U.S. Department of Education, if you are going to have 7,000 \nregulations--and we in Congress are guilty of causing that to happen, \nlet me admit that--at least somebody in the Department of Education is \ngoing to have to put on a single calendar all of the deadlines when \nsomeone at George Mason University or Vanderbilt University or some \nsmall college in Iowa has to comply with each particular regulation. \nThat will make it easier for the colleges, and it might discourage the \nnumber of new regulations.\n  Finally, universities doing a good job of keeping down the rate of \nloan defaults will be given more flexibility in how they use Federal \ndollars in grants and loans to students.\n  I am especially delighted the bill includes Teach for America \nlegislation that I introduced with the Democratic leader, Harry Reid. \nExpanding Teach for America will not only build a corps of young \ncollege graduates who spend 2 years teaching in schools in lower income \nareas, but a corps of expanding influential alumni who support quality \npublic education. I actually believe that corps of expanding \ninfluential alumni of these tremendously talented young people who \ngraduate from the finest colleges and universities and go into the \ninner city and teach for 2 years will produce for us a corps of \nthousands of Americans who know what they are talking about when the \nissue of quality public education comes up. We have the best colleges \nand universities in the world, but they need to continue to be the best \nin order to maintain our standard of living.\n  The Federal Government is doing its part. Over the last 5 years, \nFederal spending on higher education has increased 71.8 percent. At the \nsame time, State funding for higher education has increased on average \nby only 6.8 percent, partly because of the big increase in Medicaid \ncosts to States, which have increased over the same time by 35.6 \npercent. This lower amount of State funding has meant that college \ntuition at public 4-year institutions has increased 38.2 nationally.\n  In Tennessee, the situation is equally pronounced. As I stated, \nFederal spending on higher education has increased 71.8 percent over \nthe past 5 years. In Tennessee, spending on higher education has \nincreased about 10 percent while Medicaid spending has increased by 71 \npercent. That is why during the same period the tuition at the \nUniversity of Tennessee has increased by 33.4 percent.\n  I raise this because I hope in our discussion of the higher education \nbill that we will come to an understanding that one of the principal \nreasons for the big increases in tuition is the out-of-control State \nspending for Medicaid. Governors--and the Presiding Officer and I were \nboth Governors--constantly have to fight to keep Medicaid spending \nunder control so we will have enough money left for quality education. \nAnd if we do not have quality colleges and universities over the next\n\n[[Page S9816]]\n\n10 years, we will not be able to keep our standard of living as we \ncompete with Japan, China, Germany, India, and Great Britain--all who \nrecognize the superiority of American higher education, and are taking \nsignificant steps to keep their brightest students home and to improve \ntheir institutions.\n  I am delighted to be able to salute Senator Enzi and Senator Kennedy. \nI know they each will have longer statements to make about the bill and \nall of its parts. But it is a good piece of legislation for students, \nit is a good piece of legislation for colleges and universities, and it \nis an excellent piece of legislation for our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/08/senate-section/article/S9816-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9816-S9820]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HURRICANE KATRINA\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today--heart-\nsick--to speak about the absolute devastation wrought by Hurricane \nKatrina. This tragedy represents the worst natural disaster in our \nNation's history.\n  This hurricane spared nothing. Estimates of damage now run as high as \n$200 billion. The cost, in human lives and suffering, is just \nstaggering.\n  Tragically, it will take weeks and weeks to ascertain the true loss \nof life. As the recovery proceeds, I pledge to do all in my power to \nhelp those in need to rebuild cities, communities, and shattered lives \nand families across the Gulf Coast.\n  My home State of California knows well the destruction possible from \nnatural disasters. So many times the people of California have been \nsaved by the generosity of the American people.\n  I have no doubt that the people of my State will now rally to the aid \nof those in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. Many already have.\n  In addition to monetary contributions from residents throughout the \nState, over 1,500 California first responders are on the scene, as well \nas over 700 California National Guard personnel, 116 California Highway \nPatrol officers, eight swiftwater rescue teams, eight urban search and \nrescue task forces, and six disaster medical assistance teams.\n  On Tuesday, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger announced that California had \naccepted a request from FEMA to provide housing and assistance for \n1,000 storm victims left homeless by the hurricane. San Diego has made \n600 beds available, San Francisco 300, and San Jose 100. And if FEMA \nasks for more, the State will be ready. Los Angeles has planned \naccommodations for 2,000 evacuees and Sacramento County is preparing \nfor 300.\n  Campuses of the University of California and California State \nUniversity systems, as well as private colleges and universities from \nacross the State, have opened their doors to college students who were \ndisplaced or had their educational plans interrupted by the hurricane. \nHundreds of students have already taken advantage of these \nopportunities and will be starting classes this fall.\n  My heart goes out to all those suffering from this catastrophe. I \nhave seen the destruction caused by massive mudslides, major \nearthquakes, and torrential rains. I have seen the fear and \nhopelessness that comes when families lose everything except the shirts \non their backs. My thoughts and prayers are with those Americans in the \npitch dark with no electricity, in shelters with their homes swept \naway, and with a future that seems without hope.\n  I commend all those who have worked literally around the clock in \nresponse to the disaster. The emergency responders--from the National \nGuard and Coast Guard to hospital workers to the local police and fire \ndepartments--have been nothing short of heroic. They are risking their \nlives and deserve our deep gratitude.\n  The American Red Cross, the Salvation Army, and many other charitable \norganizations and religious groups have mobilized thousands of \nvolunteer workers to bring aid and shelter to victims of the \ndevastation.\n  The American people are already demonstrating their tremendous \ncompassion and magnanimity--contributions exceed $500 million, with \nsurely much more to come. Nations from around the world have also \noffered to help. I thank them as well.\n  But despite the effort and concern of all these individuals, I am \nshocked at what has gone terribly wrong in preparation for Hurricane \nKatrina. What we saw in the days following the storm has been a massive \nfailure of government on all levels to anticipate, prepare, and \nrespond. Days before the storm FEMA knew it was coming. It was \nannounced well in advance that Katrina had become a lethal category 5 \nstorm as it made its way through the Gulf of Mexico.\n  To see the horrific images of the dead lying in the street \nunattended, bodies floating aimlessly facedown in the water, and \nAmericans with no choice but to relieve themselves on the field of the \nSuperdome--it boggles the mind that such depraved conditions descended \non one of America's great cities.\n  It was a flat embarrassment to the country. Those who have lost loved \nones deserved much better than these appalling conditions.\n  Senators Collins and Lieberman have launched a Governmental Affairs \nCommittee oversight investigation to ensure that the requisite support \nand resources go to those in need. They will also be examining the \ninadequate preparation and response to this disaster.\n  Senator Clinton and others have called on President Bush to appoint \nan independent national commission to review Hurricane Katrina relief \nefforts modeled after the 9/11 Commission.\n  I completely support these efforts, and would like to go on record \nwith a few of the serious concerns that I have regarding what has taken \nplace. These are all problems that we must grapple with if we are to \ntruly protect our homeland from disasters of all kinds.\n  Two days before the storm, a mandatory evacuation order went out for \nthe residents of New Orleans. But didn't Federal, State, and local \nauthorities know that tens of thousands of city residents lacked the \nfunds and means to depart and, more fundamentally, had nowhere to go?\n  As a result, the poor stayed put: stranded throughout the city and \naway from any safe and secure shelter. Clearly there is not an adequate \nmechanism for removing Americans out of harm's way in the face of a \ncrisis.\n  Warning systems and evacuation plans, prepositioning of \ntransportation assets and emergency communications facilities, are all \nin dire need of an overhaul.\n  As always in these situations, the first priority is to save lives. \nOnce the storm had passed, emergency responders went to dramatic \nlengths to save those stranded in houses, in apartments, and on \nrooftops throughout the region. Through their tireless efforts, \nthousands have been saved.\n  But what should have been an immediate and massive delivery of food, \nwater, and medical supplies to evacuees came much too late. Thousands \nof hurricane victims went for days without anything to eat or drink. \nBabies went without formula. Diabetics went without insulin. People \ntook refuge on freeways only to bake in the heat without relief or \nwater and nowhere to go.\n  I realize the unprecedented magnitude of this disaster. But the delay \nin response was simply inexcusable. It pains me to admit that people \ndied because aid did not arrive fast enough to those in need.\n  Downtown, New Orleans' Charity Hospital went unevacuated for days \nwith no food, clean water, or basic medical supplies. These represent \nthe sickest and neediest of the storm victims, and all efforts should \nhave been made for their immediate evacuation--by boat to reach the \nhospital or at least helicopter airlifts from the roof if possible. \nVigilant doctors, nurses, and other hospital workers performed \ncourageously but did not have the support they needed.\n  There seemed to be no plan in place for providing shelter once the \nstorm was over. Ad hoc decisions appeared to cause widespread confusion \nas desperate evacuees did not know where to find basic needs. Rumors \nswirled of food here and fuel there, forcing victims to scavenge in \nsearch of the basic necessities of life.\n  As regional evacuation centers filled there was no effective plan for \nlong or even short-term shelter and care of displaced residents. With \nnowhere for storm victims to go, evacuation centers turned to squalor. \nSerious reports of abuse and assault have come out of these shelters.\n  Other cities graciously volunteered to open facilities to evacuees. \nFor that\n\n[[Page S9817]]\n\nI offer them my sincere gratitude. But now even they have reached \ncapacity--the Houston Astrodome, for example. We were just not prepared \nto handle an evacuation of this magnitude.\n  We were quickly and brutally reminded that an effective response to \nthis type of tragedy cannot happen until a reasonably safe situation \nexists on the ground. This is nothing new. It is a given in these types \nof situations.\n  Yet days passed before adequate National Guard troops arrived. \nMeanwhile, thugs, miscreants, and ruthless pillagers terrorized the \nstreets and thwarted rescue and aid.\n  Command and control breakdowns have been rampant. Throughout the \nregion, complaints abound that no one seems to be in charge. This is a \nrecipe for chaos, which only works to hamper relief efforts and put \ninnocent people in serious danger. Again, this points to the fact that \nwe do not have adequate plans and mechanisms for dealing with serious \ndisasters.\n  Regrettably, I could go on, but the time for dealing with the faults \nin preparation and response has not yet come. Right now, the victims of \nHurricane Katrina need our help. Entire communities have been \ndestroyed. Families have been torn apart. Many are still missing. Tens \nof thousands remain homeless. We must find a way to help bring some \nstability and hope back into their lives.\n  Congress has made a start by keeping FEMA operations running through \nan immediate $10.5 billion appropriation last week. And the President \nhas asked for $51.8 billion more, which Congress will surely approve \nsoon. But even this will not be enough--we have just begun the effort \nto rebuild these cities and communities.\n  This is a process that will take years to accomplish and require a \ngreat deal of commitment on our part. I call on all Americans to do \nwhat they can to assist in the recovery efforts. There are countless \nopportunities and help is vitally needed.\n  As we move forward together as a nation, we also need to focus on \nconcrete solutions for improving our preparedness for calamities that \nengulf any part of the country.\n  In close cooperation with State and Federal emergency agencies, each \ncity in this country absolutely must have an effective emergency plan \nin place.\n  These plans need to include professional and skilled emergency \noperations directors, clear lines of authority, practical evacuation \nstrategies, and previously determined command centers that can be up \nand running on a moment's notice with satellite connections and powered \nby their own generators. Key department heads should carry two-way \nradios with extra battery packs at all times.\n  The plans also must have mechanisms to immediately call for and \nfacilitate the delivery of food, water, and medical supplies to areas \nin need.\n  But it is not enough to just have a plan in place. These plans must \nbe rehearsed and drilled until they become second nature for the public \nagencies, emergency responders, and communities involved. When disaster \nstrikes, there can be no confusion as to what must happen.\n  Unfortunately, even when effective and rehearsed plans exist, large-\nscale catastrophic events, such as Hurricane Katrina, can quickly \noverwhelm local jurisdictions.\n  In these cases, we need a system in place that allows the Federal \nGovernment to come in immediately with the full force of its resources \nand assume primary responsibility for response and relief.\n  The U.S. Conference of Mayors should convene a national intercity \neffort to share information and assist in emergency preparation \nefforts.\n  In emergency situations such as this, communications capabilities are \nessential. Emergency responders must have the equipment that will allow \nessential communications efforts to continue in case of the major \ndamage to infrastructure we have seen in New Orleans.\n  Clearly, the Federal Emergency Management Agency needs to change. We \nneed to look at whether the tasks charged to FEMA are too large to be \nincluded with 21 other agencies under the Department of Homeland \nSecurity.\n  Let us seriously consider professionalizing FEMA from top to bottom--\nsome have called for the resignation of the current Director, Michael \nBrown, whose credentials as an emergency manager have been widely \nquestioned.\n  FEMA needs to be devoid of political appointees and employ only the \nhighest trained professionals with expertise in transportation, \nemergency medical aid, communications, and providing Federal disaster \nassistance.\n  Funds Congress appropriates for FEMA from this point forward ought to \nbe prioritized for disaster preparation, and we need to intensively \nreview programmatic appropriations for the Department of Homeland \nSecurity which, some critics point out, has received funds diverted \nfrom the levee project in New Orleans.\n  We have a Strategic Petroleum Reserve, but shouldn't we have a \nstrategic food and water reserve too, that can, within hours, be \nairlifted into directly and brutally hit areas such as New Orleans?\n  We need preplanned, carefully thought out means for moving National \nGuardsmen and other military forces and particularly assets, such as \nhigh-water vehicles and Chinook transport helicopters, swiftly into \nplace to prevent urban areas from sinking into anarchy--as was so \npainfully evident at the convention center in New Orleans and \nthroughout the city.\n  The Army Corps of Engineers, the administration and Congress knew for \nyears about New Orleans' vulnerable topography and the inherent \nweaknesses of the 350-mile city levee system but limited funding for \nflood control work nonetheless--why?\n  The administration and Congress need to conduct a nationwide \nassessment to determine the other most vulnerable areas and have \nFederal disaster assistance resources pre-positioned if possible so no \ntime is lost in the aftermath of another future tragedy.\n  These are just a few ideas to consider. President Bush was \nconveniently understating the case last Thursday when he said that \nfederal efforts were ``not acceptable''.\n  Americans have an obligation to come together, now, with their \nresources, money, and can do spirit to save New Orleanians, their great \ncity, and all those suffering down the Gulf Coast.\n  Nothing less is acceptable.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to address the national \ncrisis we are facing in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. It is hard to \neven begin estimating the extent to which this natural disaster will \naffect all of us and, most particularly, our fellow Americans along the \ngulf coast. I extend my deepest sympathies to the victims and loved \nones of this unprecedented disaster. My thoughts and prayers are with \nall those in need.\n  Katrina is likely the largest natural disaster this nation has ever \nfaced. The storm's impact is unfathomable, and an entire region has \nbeen irrevocably affected. I cannot conceive of a perfect evacuation or \nmitigation effort for a circumstance of this magnitude. I urge people \nto refrain from allocation of blame. Finger pointing will only make \nmatters worse. For now we must show our strength as Americans: we must \ndo the best that we can with what we have.\n  Our first priority must remain search and rescue. We are working to \nsave as many lives as we can, and to send aid to those victims who at \nthis time are without adequate shelter, food, and water. We need to \nbring relief to those who are living this nightmare, beginning with the \nmost vulnerable--children, elderly, those in need of medical \nattention--and moving outward to encompass all those who can be \nreached. Once we have ensured the basic health and safety of those in \nneed, our next priority will be to begin restoring some quality of \nlife. Many have lost everything. Until the region is stabilized, they \nwill need somewhere to go, somewhere to work, somewhere to be with \ntheir families, somewhere to begin rebuilding their lives.\n  Last Friday, the Senate acted and passed a $10.5 billion emergency \nfunding package for New Orleans; however, we will need to give more \nFederal money for disaster relief. I recognize that this will be \ncostly, and although I am an advocate for fiscal responsibility, this \nis a time for the Federal Government to act.\n  We also need to reach into our own pockets and be as generous as we \ncan be. I encourage my fellow members, my fellow Ohioans, and my fellow \nAmericans to contribute to this relief effort\n\n[[Page S9818]]\n\nby calling the Red Cross at 1-800-HELP-NOW, or visiting their website \nat www.RedCross.org. The Department of Homeland Security website, \nwww.dhs.gov, also has valuable information for those wishing to make a \nmonetary donation or to offer other services such as housing, and many \nlocal communities and faith-based groups have set up collection \nagencies. Opportunities to give are readily available, and the need is \ngreat.\n  I would like to thank all those who have already opened their hearts \nand homes, and have given whatever is in their power to give. The \nresponse of this Nation, as well as many foreign countries, has been \nremarkable. Individuals, businesses, and governments--all have answered \nthis call to meet human needs, and this effort will demand that all \nlevels of government work together to ensure that what needs to get \ndone, gets done.\n  I would like to take a moment to recognize the dedication of those \nwho have offered tireless assistance to the victims of Katrina. In the \nlast eight days, the Coast Guard alone has saved over 30,000 people, \nmore than the cumulative number of its search and rescue operations for \nthe last 10 years combined. Their relief effort has been simply \nincredible. I am proud of the Coast Guard men and women who have truly \nexhibited semper paratus.\n  Katrina also reminds us of how important our National Guard troops \nare in a time of crisis. From across the United States, there are some \n41,500 National Guard troops that are on duty along the Gulf Coast. I \nam very proud of Ohio's National Guard, which have deployed a total of \n1,500 soldiers and airmen to support Operation Buckeye, Ohio's \nhurricane response operation. This includes the 437th Military Police \nBattalion, the 1-148th Infantry Battalion and the 73rd TC-Task Force \nCommand from Columbus; the 371st Corps Support Group from Kettering; \nand the 269th Combat Communications Squadron from Springfield. As we \nreview the many policy concerns that have emerged in response to \nKatrina, it will be important to look at the issues facing our National \nGuard and to work to support them.\n  I have only mentioned the Coast Guard and the National Guard, but \napproximately 100,000 people are now involved in relief efforts. These \npeople have chosen service over self and demonstrated their dedication \nto their fellow Americans. I am inspired by their efforts and I thank \nthem for their service. We owe them all our gratitude and respect.\n  In addition, words cannot express my gratitude for the 20 States that \nhave welcomed some 235,000 survivors from the gulf region. I would also \nnote the contributions that my home state is making to the recovery \neffort, in addition to the contributions of the Ohio National Guard. \nThe Ohio Department of Natural Resources deployed 24 officers with 10 \nboats and 10 vehicle-trailer combinations to Louisiana. In addition, \nhundreds of Ohio police officers and firefighters have gone or are on \ncall to go to Louisiana and Mississippi to assist with the recovery \neffort. I am pleased that Ohio has opened its arms and stands ready to \nreceive over 1,000 victims. In preparation, the State Emergency \nManagement Agency, in conjunction with their local partners, is already \nlocating housing, schools, and support services for families who have \nbeen displaced. As a former Mayor of Cleveland and Governor of Ohio, I \nam extremely proud of the Buckeye State's response.\n  However, Mr. President, in my current capacity as Chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Oversight of Government Management of the Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs Committee, I have many questions \nabout the timely response to this catastrophe which have yet to be \nanswered. In my position, I will work to make sure these questions are \nanswered because we need to understand what went right and what went \nwrong in order to better prepare for natural disasters. At this \njuncture, it is too early to prejudge the overall successes and \nfailures of each level of government during this disaster, or answer \nquestions such as, ``Should FEMA be part of DHS?'' Those answers should \nbe provided only after a careful and thorough assessment of the entire \nsituation. I would like to recognize the leadership of Senator Collins \nand Senator Lieberman, the chair and ranking member of the Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs Committee, and I look forward to \nworking with them as we examine the response of all levels of \ngovernment. However, right now, our responders have a job to do on the \ngulf coast, and our first objective should be to offer whatever \nassistance it is within our power to give.\n\n  Even though we are just beginning to wrap our arms around the \nmagnitude of this event, I would offer some initial thoughts as to how \nwe might mitigate the damage from future natural disasters like \nKatrina.\n  The responsibility of planning for, and responding to, natural \ndisasters is shared by all levels of government. But as a former Mayor \nof Cleveland and Governor of Ohio, I know firsthand the paramount \nimportance of State and local first responders. Therefore, I implore \nevery State and local emergency preparedness organization to review \ntheir action plans to ensure that they have the proper procedures and \ncontingencies in place to deal with a catastrophic event. The emergency \nplanning and response capabilities must be reviewed and, if necessary, \nrewritten to address every possible incident for a given geographic \nlocation. The safety of our citizens and communities depends on it.\n  Prior to Hurricane Katrina, I began working with the State of Ohio's \nEmergency Management Agency in efforts to assess the ability of the \nState to prevent, protect, respond to and recover from any disaster, \nwhether natural or otherwise. The State of Ohio is currently conducting \na thorough top to bottom review of their strategic and emergency \noperations plans. It is my hope that these reviews will be conducted by \nevery State.\n  I would also highlight a Federal program that can help prepare State \nand local first responders. Earlier this year I offered an amendment to \nthe Homeland Security Appropriations bill to increase funds for the \nEmergency Management Performance Grant program. The EMPG program is the \nonly source of Federal assistance that provides vital emergency \nmanagement, coordination and planning support to State and local \ngovernments and first responders for all hazards. I believe that by \ninvesting in a program with a proven track record, recovery from events \nlike Katrina will be more effective, and the EMPG should receive even \nhigher levels of funding. I will continue in my efforts to ensure that \nthe Federal Government stresses preparation for all hazards: we must be \nprepared for both terrorism and all of the blows that nature can deal.\n  Hurricane Katrina also shows that we have serious needs for the \nrepair and improvement of our Nation's aging infrastructure and \nwaterway systems. The desperate conditions these systems are currently \nin are impacting our economy, the environment, and the welfare of the \nAmerican people. The backlog of unfunded Army Corps of Engineers \noperation and maintenance projects mandated by Congress is $1.2 \nbillion. This is up from $250 million when I arrived in the Senate in \n1999.\n  It has been 5 years since Congress passed a water resources and \ndevelopment reauthorization bill. The passage of another WRDA bill \ncannot be delayed any further. It is simply too important to our Nation \nin terms of its benefits to our economy and environment and for the \nspeedy recovery for the areas affected by Hurricane Katrina.\n  The economic benefits of infrastructure projects speak for \nthemselves. The national return on investment for the Mississippi \nValley and Tributary system--the system affected by Hurricane Katrina--\nis $24 for each dollar spent, according to the National Waterways \nConference. The Corps of Engineers flood damage reduction program saves \nlives and prevents almost $8 in damages for each dollar spent.\n  Right now our infrastructure is collapsing due to insufficient \nfunding. We desperately need to provide increased funding for the Army \nCorps of Engineers. Currently, the Corps is able to function only at 50 \npercent capacity at the rate of funding proposed by the Office of \nManagement and Budget. With proper investment from Congress, our \nwaterways and ports have the potential to help strengthen our economy, \nhelp ease our Nation's growing congestion problem, and provide a better \nquality of life.\n\n[[Page S9819]]\n\n  This devastating hurricane also served to underscore the fragile \nnature of our national and economic security when the energy spigot \nwent from a full flow to merely a drip. I praise my colleague and \nChairman of the Energy Committee, Senator Domenici, for his Herculean \ntask of shepherding an energy bill through this body. That bill is a \ntremendous step toward a much larger goal, which is our Nation's energy \nindependence. However, in the aftermath of the energy bill's passage, \nwe should not assume those efforts will suffice.\n  Rather, the effects of this hurricane on our Nation's energy supply \nand the ripple effects sent through the economy should only heighten \nthe clarion call for our country. Much like our Nation committed itself \nwhen the Russians launched Sputnik and we entered the race to space, I \nbelieve we should have a national commitment to becoming energy \nindependent.\n  We should open additional domestic resources in the near term to help \nwean us from foreign oil. My colleagues from Alaska have long sought to \nopen the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge an idea I support. We should \nalso invest in clean coal technologies that will help utilize one of \nour Nation's cheapest and most abundant resources.\n  However, we should also look ahead. For instance, a great deal of \nresearch has been done in my State on hydrogen fuel cells. I have heard \nthat within a decade, commercial applications for these fuel cells will \nbe a real possibility. But I would ask, why 10 years? Why not five? I \ntruly believe there is too much at stake to ignore or merely feign \ninterest in becoming energy independent.\n  I do not think it hyperbole to say that one of the main factors that \nwill determine the next great superpower will be the nation that is \nable to become energy independent. The commitment we make today will \ndetermine the safety and quality of life future generations will have. \nI pray that we heed this warning.\n  Finally, I would like to address an issue related to Hurricane \nKatrina, and that is the soaring gasoline prices across the Nation. In \nthe wake of the horrible tragedy caused by Hurricane Katrina, it now \nappears that some individuals may be profiting off the misfortune of \nothers. This is unconscionable. It is unfortunate that there are no \nFederal laws in place to address and stop the price gouging of \ngasoline. In fact, less than half of our States have laws on the books \nto protect consumers from price gouging. Therefore, I am considering \nlegislation to provide the Federal Government with the requisite \nauthority to investigate cases of gasoline price gouging during an \nemergency. This proposed legislation would resolve this issue by \nproviding a Federal framework for protecting consumers against this \nunjustifiable business practice. I would note that I have been actively \ninvolved in this issue for several years. I participated in hearings in \n2000, 2002, and 2004 in two different committees, and I have asked \nSenator Collins to explore this issue in the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee.\n  Mr. President, these are but a handful of the issues that must be \naddressed in the weeks and months ahead. Let us roll up our sleeves and \nget to work. Let us learn from this horrible tragedy that has befallen \nthe gulf coast, and forge better laws and procedures for the future. In \nclosing, my heart goes out to the victims of this disaster, and I ask \nthat all Americans do what they can to assist them.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, we have \nseen images we thought we would never see in America. We have been \nreminded that we are all part of the American family. And we have a \nresponsibility to help members of that family when they are in need.\n  We in Congress have a responsibility to do all we can in many ways. \nLet's make sure children don't lose a year of their lives. Let's help \nthem return to as much of a normal environment as possible. We need to \nact quickly to provide the help they and their parents need to cope \nwith this strategy, and rebuild their future.\n  We all remember Hurricane Andrew, the category-5 hurricane that left \nover $40 billion in damage in 1992. It tore through south Florida, and \nthe Army, Navy, and National Guard pitched in to help schools repair \nclassrooms and reopen the school doors in about 2 weeks.\n  Last year, Hurricane Charley tore through central Florida and left \n$15 billion in damage. Schools closed, but within a month, they \nreturned to normal and students were back on track in their classrooms.\n  But Hurricane Katrina is a different type of storm, and the magnitude \nof its damage is vastly more extensive.\n  In Mississippi alone, 271 schools have been damaged or destroyed. \nSchools are closed in the three gulf coast cities in the State hit \nhardest by Katrina Gulfport, Biloxi, and Pascagoula. Those districts \nenroll 20,000 students.\n  In North Gulfport, the walls of the Harrison Central 9th Grade School \ncollapsed. In Pascagoula, the roof of St. Martin High blew off. The \nState superintendent has already requested help from Washington to find \nportable classrooms. Officials are considering converting an abandoned \nKmart into a temporary school.\n  Vastly more damage has occurred in Louisiana. At least 135,000 \nstudents in public schools have been displaced. 100,000 college \nstudents have been displaced for the fall semester at Tulane, the \nUniversity of New Orleans, Xavier University, and Loyola University.\n  Fortunately, America has begun to respond.\n  The Houston school district has pledged to accommodate 30,000 \ndisplaced students in their schools. The Dallas Public Schools has \ncreated a hotline to streamline enrollment for displaced students. St. \nPaul, MN is willing to accept 5,000 in its schools.\n  In Massachusetts, more than 30 colleges and universities have offered \nto enroll students, and provide housing and tuition assistance.\n  People have opened their homes and communities have opened their \nschools. We owe a great debt of gratitude to the principals, the \nsuperintendents, and the university presidents and deans who have \npledged their help.\n  But they need help from Congress as they struggle to accommodate \nthese students. We need a response that is as caring and as generous as \nthe American spirit.\n  We must do all we can to assist schools and colleges as they attempt \nto meet the incredible challenge of incorporating hundreds or thousands \nof new students into their systems.\n  We must provide funds to help ease the transition of students into \nnew school districts, support basic instruction, and purchase books and \nmaterials. We must help schools temporarily expand facilities and avoid \novercrowding.\n  We must help college students find temporary help so they don't lose \na semester or a year of college, and give them the financial assistance \nthey need to continue.\n  We must also help former students who are paying off past loans, by \noffering every affected borrower a 6 month grace period when no further \ninterest will accrue so they can avoid any increased cost or damage to \ntheir credit while they get their lives back on track.\n  Thousands of young children affected by Katrina need temporary space \nin safe and healthy settings. We must provide them with quality early \nchildhood programs and facilities, until the children and their \nfamilies can return to their homes and communities.\n  And in weeks and months ahead, we must focus on rebuilding and \nreconstructing the schools devastated by the tragedy so that, as soon \nas possible, children can return to schools fully stocked with the \nresources they need.\n  This morning, Senator Enzi and I heard moving testimony in the HELP \nCommittee from Dr. Diane Roussel, Superintendent of Schools in \nJefferson Parish in Louisiana. The parish has 85 schools, 51,000 \nstudents and 3,600 teachers. It lies just south of New Orleans, and was \ndirectly in the path of Katrina.\n  The local tax base provides a third of the district's resources for \neducation to help students who have been displaced. Now, they're left \nwith nothing to re-build their schools.\n  In Dr. Roussel's words:\n\n       Money isn't always the answer to solving the ills in our \n     public schools, but when we're talking about equipment, \n     supplies, rebuilding, and maintaining our teaching workforce, \n     money is the answer.\n\n  We're reminded in this disaster that schools are the heart of local \ncommunities across America. When schools\n\n[[Page S9820]]\n\nopen, people return. When schools open, business returns, and life \nbegins to return to normal.\n  In the coming days and weeks, we must act expeditiously to provide \nthe help that the entire gulf coast community needs to re-open its \nschools. If they get what they need, I am confident they will come \nback, stronger than ever before. Let's get it done.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to take a moment, on behalf of \nmyself, my fellow Vermonters and Americans across this country, to \nexpress our heartfelt gratitude for the outpouring of generosity by \nmore than 90 countries and international organizations that have \noffered assistance to the recovery efforts after Hurricane Katrina.\n  The United States is coping with devastation and destruction on a \nscale not seen in our lifetimes. It has been shocking and sobering to \nsee how woefully unprepared our Government was to help the victims of \nthis disaster. The chaotic response has also raised serious concerns \nabout the adequacy of our preparedness to respond to terrorist attacks, \ndespite the many billions of dollars the Department of Homeland \nSecurity has spent since 9/11.\n  Yet if there is a silver lining in such a disaster it is that it \nunites Americans and it unites the world in the common cause of \nalleviating suffering. A massive relief effort is underway, albeit \nbelatedly, involving everyone from the Coast Guard to the Red Cross to \nprivate citizens who are rescuing people who were stranded and caring \nfor those who lost their homes and possessions. Organizations such as \nthe United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, \nthe World Food Program, World Health Organization, UNICEF and the U.N. \nHigh Commissioner for Refugees have all contributed personnel and \nresources to help in the recovery. Canadian search and rescue teams \nfrom as far away as British Colombia were on the ground in some \nLouisiana communities as early as August 31, even before FEMA had \nmobilized American relief workers.\n  It is not often that we, the world's only superpower, find ourselves \non the receiving end of foreign aid. It is almost always the other way \naround, when Americans respond, as we do continuously, to the needs of \npeople suffering from famine, conflict and natural disasters overseas. \nIt is notable that our own disaster relief specialists in USAID's \nOffice of Foreign Disaster Assistance are assisting in this domestic \nrecovery effort.\n  The outpouring of sympathy and the hundreds of millions of dollars in \ncontributions by Americans to the victims of the South Asian tsunami \nearlier this year are today being reciprocated by some of those same \ncountries, and by scores of others.\n  From the wealthiest European countries and Japan, to the poorest, \nsuch as Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, generous offers of cash, water \npurification and communications equipment, and emergency and medical \npersonnel have been extraordinarily gratifying.\n  But while no offers have been expressly rejected by the U.S. \nGovernment, few have been accepted and received. It is regrettable that \nour Government's abysmal coordination in the early days of the recovery \neffort has prevented critical international aid from being delivered to \nour stricken citizens and communities in the affected Gulf states.\n  One of many examples is Canada's offer to send three warships and a \nCoast Guard vessel. They were delayed for a week due to bureaucratic \ninertia.\n  I know that in any major humanitarian crisis when unsolicited offers \nof aid pour in it is difficult to coordinate and use it immediately. \nSome is simply not usable, such as electric generators that require a \nvoltage not readily available in this country. There are also problems \nof limited access to airfields and ground transportation, and the \nnecessary personnel to handle and distribute it. But these obstacles \nshould have been anticipated. Bureaucratic backlogs and bungling have \nkept foreign relief planes grounded for days, medical personnel on \nstandby, and tons of supplies waiting to be delivered to the desperate \npeople of Louisiana and Mississippi.\n  The sluggish response has left foreign governments frustrated and \nbaffled. I think it needs to be emphasized how much we welcome and \nappreciate their generous offers of help. It is unfortunate that our \ngovernment was so unprepared to receive this aid in a timely manner, \nwhen lives could have been saved and suffering alleviated. Let us hope \nthat the bottlenecks are being removed so the State Department, the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, and particularly FEMA, can speed the \ndelivery of aid from our friends around the world without further \ndelay.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/08/senate-section/article/S9820-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9820]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. SMITH.

Mr. President, according to a report last year by the \nBrady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, teenagers and children are \ninvolved in more than 10,000 accidental shootings in which close to 800 \npeople die each year. Further, about 1,500 children age 14 and under \nare treated in hospital emergency rooms for unintentional firearm \ninjuries per year. About 38 percent of them have injuries severe enough \nto require hospitalization. We can do more to reduce the number of \nthese tragedies, the vast majority of which could be prevented if safe \ngun storage techniques were more widely practiced.\n  A study released Tuesday by researchers from the Center for Disease \nControl and Prevention, reportedly the largest of its kind ever carried \nout, analyzed the prevalence of firearms in homes and the storage \npractices of gun owners. Researchers analyzed survey results from more \nthan 240,000 randomly selected households in all 50 States and the \nDistrict of Colombia.\n  While the rates of gun ownership and the storage practices vary \nwidely from State to State, the CDC researchers found that nearly a \nthird of households in the U.S. have firearms. According to the study, \nin 18 different States more than 10 percent of households contain \nloaded firearms. In one State, the number is higher than 19 percent. In \naddition, in 23 different States more than 5 percent of households keep \nfirearms unlocked and loaded. The most startling statistic revealed by \nresearchers is that 1.69 million children in the U.S. live in \nhouseholds where firearms are kept unlocked and loaded.\n  Statistics like these should give us pause, especially when we \nconsider the impact that safe gun storage practices can have on \npreventing accidental shootings and suicides by kids using guns. A \nstudy published recently in the Journal of the American Medical \nAssociation found that the risk of unintentional shooting or suicide by \nminors using a gun is reduced by as much as 61 percent when ammunition \nin the home is locked up. Simply storing ammunition separately from the \ngun reduces such occurrences by more than 50 percent.\n  Recently, I joined with 69 of my colleagues in voting for an \namendment offered by Senator Kohl that would require licensed dealers, \nmanufacturers, and importers to include a safe gun storage or gun \nsafety device with every handgun they sell. Hopefully Senator Kohl's \namendment will become law.\n  We can do more to help stop accidents involving children and guns. I\n\n[[Page S9821]]\n\nurge my colleagues to join me in supporting commonsense gun storage \nrequirements so that fewer families will have to endure the pain of \nlosing a child or loved one because of a preventable tragedy involving \na firearm.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/08/senate-section/article/S9821-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9821]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                THE WINDFALL PROFITS REBATE ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, yesterday I introduced legislation called \nthe Windfall Profits Rebate Act of 2005 that attempts to address the \nspiraling cost of oil and gasoline. Let me explain why I introduced \nthis measure.\n  I come from a State of 642,000 citizens spread out in a landmass 10 \ntimes the size of Massachusetts.\n  As a result of being a large Northern Great Plains State with a small \npopulation and being a predominately agricultural State, we use a \nsubstantial amount of energy, specifically gasoline.\n  In fact, North Dakota uses twice as much gasoline per capita than New \nYork does. Though these price spikes hurt all Americans, they are \nespecially devastating to citizens who live in rural States.\n  Let me say first that the tragedy that we are witnessing on the Gulf \nCoast is devastating. The effects of Hurricane Katrina will be felt by \nthe people of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama for a long time to \ncome and my prayers go out to them in this time of need. The people in \nthe gulf region have lost so much.\n  It is also the case that the hurricane has affected America's energy \nsupply in the short term. A number of refineries were shut down. A \ncouple of major pipelines were unable to operate and there has been and \nwill be an impact on our energy supply and marketing as a result of \nthis hurricane.\n  But it important to understand that the price spikes we have seen \nwith the price of oil and gasoline cannot be blamed exclusively on this \nhurricane.\n  We were headed down this road long before Hurricane Katrina hit.\n  In fact, since the beginning of 2004, we have seen the price of oil \ndouble from $35 a barrel to nearly $70 a barrel and that has resulted \nin consumers having to pay more than $3 a gallon for gasoline in many \nparts of the country.\n  It is important to point out that at $35 a barrel, the energy \nindustry was making record profits. Now the oil industry claims that \nthese higher prices are a result of supply-and-demand issues and that \nthey need these additional profits for exploration.\n  However, I believe that the extra $30 per barrel that is tacked on to \na barrel of oil these days represents a windfall or excess profit to \nthe major integrated oil companies, and I propose that we recapture \npart of that with an excise tax and rebate it to consumers who are \npaying these inflated gas prices.\n  Here are some numbers to remember: We use 21 million barrels of oil a \nday in this country. Forty percent of that comes from domestically \nproduced oil. The major integrated oil companies are larger and have \nmore economic clout than they have had previously. They are \nexperiencing the $30-a-barrel increased price above the $35 price that \nexisted in January 2004, and that means they are reaping $7 billion a \nmonth in windfall or excess profits. That is $80 billion a year in \nexcess or windfall profits. That is being paid by consumers who drive \nup to the service station and now receive the sticker shock of paying \nan arm and a leg for a tank full of gas.\n  A friend of mine gassed up his car and his son's car with 15 gallons \nin each car the other day and paid $103.00 at the gas pump.\n  In addition to the windfall profits being gathered by the major \nintegrated oil companies in our country, it is also the case that 60 \npercent of that which we use comes from off our shore. That has become \na type of forced revenue sharing from American consumers to the Saudis, \nKuwaitis, and others. There is not much we can do about that in the \nshort term except to implement policies that try to wean us away from \nthe addiction we have to foreign oil.\n  However, with respect to domestic companies and domestic production \nand domestic pricing, we can do something.\n  My legislation calls for a 50-percent excise tax on crude oil profits \nover $40 a barrel when those prices are earned by the largest oil \ncompanies with the most ability to control the overall price. These are \ncompanies that, in many cases, move oil from the ground to gas pumps \nand control all of the processes in between. The revenue that would be \ncollected from this excise tax would be used to provide a rebate to \nAmerican consumers to help them offset the burden of higher energy \ncosts that they are now forced to pay.\n  But my legislation also has a very important exemption. If the oil \ncompany is using the revenue from the extra $30 a barrel they are \nreceiving to increase exploration, or make investments to search for \nadditional sources of energy, or to increase refining capacity, or to \npursue investments in other renewable forms of energy, then that money \nwould be exempt from this windfall profits tax.\n  In other words, these large companies would decide themselves whether \nthey pay this tax. If they are buying back their stock or hoarding cash \nwith which to engage in mergers and acquisitions, then they would be \npaying the excise tax and the consumers would be receiving the benefit \nof that excise tax.\n  I am not trying to hurt the oil companies or put them out of \nbusiness. I want additional robust domestic exploration that would be \nexempt from the windfall profits tax.\n  However, American consumers should not pay these inflated prices just \nto fatten the corporate treasury of the major integrated oil companies.\n  The substantial rise in the price of oil and gas has produced both \npain and gain. The pain is for American consumers and the gain has been \nfor the major integrated oil companies and OPEC countries, and I think \nCongress ought to weigh in on behalf of American consumers. That is \nwhat my bill attempts to do.\n  And with its exemption for investment in exploration, it does not \nattempt to help consumers by punishing oil companies.\n  I hope Congress will immediately consider adopting this measure and \nprovide some help to American consumers at a time when gasoline prices \nare providing sticker shock every single day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/08/senate-section/article/S9821-2", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9821-S9822]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       INQUIRY ON GASOLINE PRICES\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I appreciate this opportunity \nto speak about S. 1610, a bill requiring the Federal Trade Commission \nto conduct an inquiry into the retail price of gasoline. I thank my \ncolleagues, Senators Frist and Harry Reid, for their leadership and \nSenators Landrieu and Vitter and so many others for their efforts in \nworking through this time of unprecedented destruction and human \nsuffering.\n  I am here today to lend my support for giving U.S. gasoline consumers \na more thorough understanding of the pricing mechanisms that are at \nplay at the pump. The legislation I propose calls for the Federal Trade \nCommission to conduct an immediate study into whether rising gas prices \nare the result of a struggling market or whether market manipulation or \na form of gouging is taking place during this time of tragedy.\n  Even before Hurricane Katrina, the Consumer Federation of America \ncited several reasons for the dramatic increase in gasoline prices, \nincluding tight crude oil inventories, inadequate oil refinery \ncapacity, lack of competition and the oil industry's increasing market \npower. These are all plausible reasons for price spikes, but they are \nnot enough to stop the questions of people concerned with their tighter \nbudgets.\n  Between Nebraska and Iowa, more than 500 complaints have been made to \nState officials about high prices. Officials in both States indicate \nthey have seen no evidence of market manipulation by retailers. \nRetailers are not singled out as the focus of this bill.\n  My bill calls for a 2-week study on the root of rising gasoline \nprices, including both regular gasoline and ethanol-blended gasoline. \nThe report would then be forwarded to Congress for further action. If \nthe report determines no market manipulation is occurring, the FTC \nwould notify the U.S. Secretary of Energy, who would use the \ninformation to determine whether the Federal petroleum reserve would \nneed to be tapped for additional oil.\n  But if manipulation is found, we will have the opportunity to act \nquickly.\n\n[[Page S9822]]\n\nThe FTC would work with the attorneys general of various affected \nStates to take appropriate action.\n  I am aware that inquiries as these have been conducted in the past, \nparticularly around this time of year. Price surges around the time of \nthe Labor Day holiday are common. As the prices fall, interest in \ndetermining why they reached record level diminishes. I hope this can \nbe different. Even if prices begin to fall, which it appears they may, \nwe still need to know what happened and why it happened.\n  Oil, as we all know, is the most widely used source of energy in the \nworld. Facts indicate that world production of oil will start to \ndecline. However, demand will not. At what point the production of oil \nwill fall below demand cannot be accurately determined, but I believe \nthat recent events that have disrupted normal supply and demand \nbehavior is an illustration of what consumers can expect once that day \narrives.\n\n  This is why, after years of delay, it was so important that we were \nable to pass an energy bill, allowing for the development of more \nenergy sources. I am hopeful that these energy sources, particularly \nrenewable fuels made from farm commodities, will be developed quickly \nenough to prevent price surges at times the oil supply or refinery \ncapacity is disrupted.\n  According to the American Petroleum Institute, Nebraska has the \ndistinct honor of being the only State west of Arkansas to see prices \njump more than 50 cents per gallon since August 30. Why Nebraska? Let's \nfind out.\n  In many cases, we saw pump price increases of 20, 30, 40 cents and \neven higher in a single day. Why such a dramatic increase? Let's find \nout.\n  We know there exists a very healthy competition between gasoline \nretailers, yet the price range for the same grade of gasoline yesterday \nwas $3.19 in Lincoln, Nebraska and $2.99 in nearby Fremont. Why the \ndifference? Let's find out.\n  What role do speculators play in establishing price? Let's find out.\n  These questions, and others, are important. Every part of our \nNation's economy is impacted by these increases.\n  For example, the extraordinary prices of gasoline, diesel fuel, \nnatural gas and petroleum derived input products such as fertilizer, \nchemicals and propane add another economic burden, particularly in \nrural areas and for farmers and ranchers who count on a ready and \naccessible energy supply for the production and harvest of their crops \nand livestock.\n  We need stable and reasonable gasoline, diesel, and natural gas \nprices to operate farm machinery, dry grain, and transport commodities \nto market, especially during the coming harvest season. The extreme \nvolatility of world crude oil and petroleum product prices, according \nto USDA, has already impacted net farm income by over $2 billion.\n  When we take a hard look at the facts, we will better understand the \nforces affecting prices at the pump. We'll understand why in Nebraska \nwe pay prices that range from $2.89 to $3.61 and higher. We'll \nunderstand reports of $6.00 gasoline in Atlanta and even higher prices \nat home and abroad. This legislation is nothing but beneficial for \nAmerican gasoline consumers.\n  Now, I ask my colleagues to join me in promoting legislation that \nwill provide valuable information on our Nation and the world's \ntransportation fuels.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/08/senate-section/article/S9822-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9822]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NATIONAL ASSISTED LIVING WEEK\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I want to draw attention to the 11th \nannual National Assisted Living Week, which begins on September 11 and \ncontinues through September 17. Created in 1995 by the National Center \nfor Assisted Living, and being celebrated for the second time in \nconjunction with the American Association of Homes and Services for the \nAging and Assisted Living Federation of America, National Assisted \nLiving Week emphasizes the importance of assisted living services to \nthe more than 1 million seniors and persons with disabilities who rely \non them every day.\n  The theme for this week is ``A Fair to Remember.'' The theme \nencourages assisted living facilities to create their own ``Fair'' \nenvironment for the residents, families, staff, volunteers and local \ncommunity and to celebrate their time together and share the fun with \nfamily and friends.\n  Assisted living continues to grow in importance as our society's \ndemographics change and as we live longer. Seniors and their families \nwant a homelike setting and are seeking alternatives to nursing homes. \nBecause assisted living has been able to develop to meet community \nneeds, it can be very different in different States. However, the goal \nis the same: to provide quality care for those who need some help in \ncaring for themselves but are not in need of the care provided by a \nnursing home.\n  My home State of Oregon pioneered the concept of assisted living, and \nI am proud of my State's ability to continue to evolve the concept so \nthat it meets the changing needs of seniors. All of us want to be in a \nsafe environment and as independent as possible for as long as \npossible. Assisted living provides care while maintaining the dignity \nof the individuals they serve. Our Nation must continue to support \nthose long-term care options that allow consumers the care setting that \nis appropriate for their needs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/08/senate-section/article/S9822-2", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9822]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             IN HONOR OF LIEUTENANT COMMANDER LUKE CLYBURN\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it is with great pride that I pay tribute \nto an exceptional educator and steward of the Great Lakes, LCDR Luke \nClyburn. Commander Clyburn is captain of the ship ``Pride of Michigan'' \nand president of the Noble Odyssey Foundation. He is an innovative, \ncommitted leader who has worked for more than 32 years to educate young \npeople about the importance of the Great Lakes and other fresh water \nlakes through the Naval Sea Cadets training program. We are grateful \nfor his long and distinguished service.\n  The U.S. Naval Sea Cadet Corps was incorporated by an act of Congress \nin 1962, and a Great Lakes Division was added in 1973. The mission of \nthe Corps is to ``encourage and aid American youth to develop, train \nthem in seagoing skills, and to teach them patriotism, courage, self-\nreliance and kindred virtues.'' For more than 32 years, Commander \nClyburn has accepted that charge.\n  Under Commander Clyburn's able leadership, the Sea Cadet program \nacquired a retired naval vessel, the ``Noble Odyssey,'' in 1977. On it, \nSea Cadets from Michigan learned to man a ship from bow to stern, and \nthey took part in invigorating scientific missions. With the cadets as \ncrew, Commander Clyburn put together a series of Great Lakes research \nprojects with professional scientists.\n  In 1989, it was my honor to help Commander Clyburn replace the \n``Noble Odyssey'' with a larger ship, another retired naval vessel, the \n``Pride of Michigan.'' On the ``Pride of Michigan,'' Luke has continued \nthe same great work with the same great results. The scientific work \nhas included significant research on invasive zebra mussels, which are \nharming the Great Lakes, and an investigation of an ancient drowned \nforest 2 miles off of Lexington, MI. These projects have been filmed \nand produced into documentaries, including the educational videos \n``Fresh Water Invaders,'' ``Angels of the Sea,'' ``Emperor,'' ``The \nUnderwater Forest,'' and ``The Norwood Project.''\n  In 2002, the Noble Odyssey Foundation was established as a nonprofit \norganization to raise money for the Sea Cadet Corps.

Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart to \nhonor the\n\n[[Page S9823]]\n\nlife of a great man, Jon Krahulik, who died this week after a \ncourageous struggle with cancer. He was a good friend, devoted family \nman, and faithful public servant. I will miss him dearly, and I know \nthat sentiment is shared by countless others across Indiana.\n  I had the honor of appointing Jon to the Indiana Supreme Court more \nthan 15 years ago. While on the court, he served Indiana with \ndistinction, garnering the admiration of all those whom he encountered. \nDuring his time on the bench, he authored nearly 120 opinions, shaping \nthe laws of our State and influencing policymakers across the country.\n  Whether it was teaching law, serving as a trial lawyer, working to \nreform State government or recommending changes to Indiana's criminal \njustice system, Jon brought to bear his remarkable talents and his \nbelief in the potential of humanity. He always sought justice while \nforging collective solutions. His record of service to the legal \nprofession was matched only by his service and dedication to the \ncommunity.\n  Jon went to law school in Indianapolis and stayed on to practice law \nfor nearly two decades at Bingham Summers Welsh & Spilman. He resigned \nfrom the Indiana Supreme Court to become president at Chemed Corp., in \nCincinnati. A true family man who possessed a deep love for the law, \nJon later returned to Indianapolis to start a law firm with his two \nsons.\n  His personal accomplishments are as impressive as his professional \nones. A man of incredible physical strength, Jon ran in several \nmarathons and competed in an Iron Man Triathlon in Hawaii.\n  Indiana lost a great man when cancer took Jon away from us. It is my \nsad honor to enter the name of Jon Krahulik in the Record of the United \nStates Senate for his service to Indiana and for his profound \ncontributions to the field of law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/08/senate-section/article/S9823-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9823]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO ELLIOTT BALBERT\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, more than 10 years ago I was proud \nto work shoulder to shoulder with Senator Orrin Hatch to pass the \nDietary Supplement Health Education Act, DSHEA, to give consumers \naccess to dietary supplements and truthful information about these \nproducts. That is one of the reasons it is my great pleasure to pay \nspecial tribute to Elliott Balbert, upon his retirement as the \npresident of the Dietary Supplement Education Alliance.\n  Elliott Balbert recognized the need to get the word out about the \ngrowing body of scientific support for dietary supplement use. So, 5 \nyears ago, he created a unique industry alliance of companies to focus \non providing meaningful information about the health benefits and \nresponsible use of dietary supplements.\n  Starting a brandnew nonprofit organization is not easy. There were \nvolunteers to recruit, a board to create, paperwork to file, and money \nto raise. But even though Elliott was still a full-time CEO of a large \npublic company, he managed to build a solid foundation on which the \nDietary Supplement Education Alliance can continue to grow.\n  Elliott Balbert served as president of the board of trustees for the \nDietary Supplement Education Alliance for more than 4 years. He planted \nthe seeds, nurtured them, and watched them blossom into a thriving \norganization.\n  I admire the fact that Elliott isn't afraid to put his money where \nhis mouth is. He has provided ongoing philanthropic support to a number \nof health-related charities, including the Vitamin Angels, the Healthy \nFoundation, and other initiatives that provide health benefits to the \nunderprivileged.\n  As Elliott moves on to dedicate more time to his business, I want to \ntake this opportunity to express my gratitude for the outstanding job \nhe has done for the Dietary Supplement Education Alliance. We wish \nElliott and his family all the best, and we salute his leadership in \nworking toward a healthier America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/08/senate-section/article/S9823-2", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9823-S9824]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       JOSEPH P. ``SONNY'' FOSTER\n\n Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I am here today to \nspeak about my cherished friend, long time aide, and trusted \nconfidante, Sonny Foster, who died unexpectedly on August 25.\n  I first met Sonny in 1973 when he and I served together on the Urban \nLeague Board. Sonny was still a student at Creighton and I was counsel \nto an insurance company. Sonny loved to tell the story of my first \nUrban League meeting at the old Logan Fontenelle Center. When the \nmeeting ended and I went to drive home, I found, to my dismay, that \nsomeone had helped themselves to my battery. Sonny retold the story the \nweek before he died. With his unique high-pitched laugh he said ``We \nnever expected to see him again!'' But I came back and a friendship \nbegan that lasted for more than 30 years!\n  In 1989, when I was planning to run for Governor, some 16 years \nlater, we teamed up. No one ever expected us to win, and we never \nexpected to lose. And we didn't. It was his first time to manage a \nstatewide campaign and my first time as a candidate for office. Of this \nvictory, the Omaha World-Herald said in its August 27, 2005 editorial \n``Foster put his stamp on the political map of Nebraska by the start of \nthe 21st Century--not only because of his assistance in planting Ben \nNelson firmly in the political firmament, but also in his steadfast \nefforts to make the Democratic Party a force in his North Omaha base.''\n  Much has been made of Sonny's firsts. He was the first African \nAmerican elected to be student body president at Creighton University \nin 1973. He was the first African American elected to the Omaha Board \nof Education by district. He was also the first African American to run \na statewide campaign in Nebraska. Sonny had a long and distinguished \ncareer in public service including serving as a legislative aide for \nCongressman John Cavanaugh and as deputy labor commissioner for \nGovernor Bob Kerrey. When I was Governor, he served in multiple \npositions in my administration.\n  These are indeed significant accomplishments. And it is indeed \nappropriate that we celebrate them. But you know what Sonny treasured \nmost was breaking the ground for others to follow--much more than \nanything he did on his own. In a very real sense, Sonny lived his life \nso others could enjoy their own success. Sonny lit the torch and passed \nit on. We must commit to never let that torch go out because of apathy \nor inaction. He set the standard--it is for others, for us, to now \nuphold.\n  I had a lot of time to think about what to say about Sonny in the \neulogy I delivered at his memorial service hoping to do justice to a \nmost remarkable life cut short by some divine plan which we must \nreluctantly accept. I started by listing his many qualities: Sonny was \nbrilliant and perceptive. He was loyal, honest, trustworthy, \ndependable, responsible, competent, caring, passionate and \ncompassionate.\n  He was totally trustworthy. Sonny was honest. He would tell you what \nyou needed to know, not what he thought you wanted to hear. This was \none of his most endearing qualities.\n  One time I teased him by saying I preferred to be told that my idea \nwas unlikely to work rather than be asked ``who came up with that crazy \nidea?''\n  Sonny was focused on getting things done. No task was ever too big or \nimportant or too small for him. Stories abound about his tackling \nimpossible immigration cases and solving them. He met my plane when he \ncould have assigned it to someone else. Those 20 minute trips gave us \nuninterrupted time to talk, to catch up, and to tease one another about \none thing or another.\n  Then there is Sonny's passion. Everyone has a story about how \nstrongly Sonny Foster felt about each and every cause. He didn't suffer \nfoolishness. He possessed the ability to sort things out. Not bashful, \nhe told you what he thought and sometimes in colorful terms. Most of \nthose terms cannot be repeated here. Some thought Sonny lacked \npatience. I see it the other way around. His dedication, his devotion \nto his work, his dogged perseverance manifested itself in bold and \nbombastic ways. When he cared, you knew it!\n  Underneath the bombast and the passion was a deep well of compassion. \nSonny had a soft, caring side. I think today of all those constituents \nwho benefited from his good work in our office. How he cared about \ntheir problems! He left an indelible impression.\n  An e-mail from a young TV reporter who has left Omaha for another \nmarket\n\n[[Page S9824]]\n\nwrote, ``A few years ago, Sonny took time out of his schedule to talk \nwith me about working in politics. I walked away from that evening \nknowing Sonny loved his job meeting and working for all Nebraskans and \nrepresenting Gov./Sen. Nelson. I'll never forget his guidance, career \nadvice and passion for his job.''\n  What was an everyday meeting for Sonny made a lasting impression on \nthis young man. Sonny had that affect on people.\n  I will be the first to admit that I wouldn't be standing here today \nafter 15 years in elective office without Sonny. He had a political \nsense unmatched in Nebraska. He heard the rumblings long before the \nstorms. He didn't need to poll anyone to determine the mood of the \npeople. He just knew. His instincts were right on. And that's why \npeople sought his opinion and listened when he spoke.\n  Mrs. Foster described the last time she was with Sonny as being \n``jolly.'' Have I mentioned that laugh? Sonny filled the room with his \npresence and his persona. It overflowed when he laughed that unique, \ninfectious belly laugh. No one enjoyed a practical joke more than \nSonny, except maybe me! I think Mrs. Foster will forever keep that \nwonderful memory of Sonny and by sharing it with all of us has given us \na gift we should cherish.\n  Thank you Sonny, for all you did for me, for my family, and most \nimportant, for the State of Nebraska. The ``good life'' will not quite \nbe the same without you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/08/senate-section/article/S9824-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9824]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n CELEBRATING THE OPENING OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, MERCED CAMPUS\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to recognize the opening of \nthe University of California, Merced, the first new University of \nCalifornia campus in 40 years.\n  The University of California, Merced is the 10th campus in the \nUniversity of California system, widely renowned as one of the finest \npublic university systems in the world. Merced, located in the heart of \nthe San Joaquin Valley in Central California, was selected as the site \nof the new campus in 1995 after a thorough and competitive screening \nprocess that took 7 years and involved more than 80 different \nlocations.\n  The 1,000 students in the inaugural 2005 class are a shining example \nof the diversity that is a great strength of California. Students from \nDel Norte to San Diego, and from the Pacific Coast to the Sierra \nNevada, make up the diverse student body population. A significant \nnumber of the students are the first in their families to attend \ncollege and come from underrepresented ethnic or racial minority groups \nin the Central Valley.\n  The University of California, Merced will grow steadily in the coming \nyears. Initially, the university will offer major degrees in nine \ndifferent majors from three disciplines: engineering, natural sciences, \nand social sciences, arts and humanities. Graduate degrees in the three \nmajor disciplines will also be available. Total enrollment is expected \nto reach 5,000 in 5 years and reach 25,000 in 2035. The number of \nacademic programs and degree offerings will increase accordingly as the \nuniversity grows.\n  The students, faculty, and staff of the inaugural UC Merced class \ndeserve special praise for their vision as they take on the \nresponsibility of building and expanding the 10th University of \nCalifornia to one that will some day be steep in tradition, history, \nand excellence. In due time, the students, faculty, and the staff of \nthe first UC Merced class will be rightfully seen as pioneers to those \nwho will follow in their path in the years and decades to come.\n  The opening of the University of California, Merced is made possible \nby the tireless work and dedication of scores of committed public \nofficials, hard-working professionals, and determined citizens. Every \nperson who has lent a helping hand to the UC Merced campus can take \ngreat pride in knowing that their hard work has resulted in greater \nopportunities for future generations of California students.\n  I congratulate the University of California, Merced on its opening, \nand wish its faculty, students and the community a bright future as \nthey help make the Central Valley and California an even better place \nto live.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/08/senate-section/article/S9824-2", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9824]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CHARLES CITY, IOWA, REVITALIZATION\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, one of the greatest challenges we \nface--not just in Iowa but all across America--is preserving the \ncharacter and vitality of our small towns. This is about economics, but \nit is also about our culture and identity. After all, you won't find \nthe heart and soul of Iowa at Wal-Mart or Home Depot out in the strip \nmalls. No, the heart and soul of Iowa is in our family farms, and on \nMain Street in small communities all across my State. That's why we \nneed to be as generous as possible--and creative as possible--in \nkeeping our downtowns not just alive but thriving.\n  As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I am involved in \nfunding many hundreds of programs every year. But the Main Street Iowa \nprogram--providing challenge grants to revitalize downtown buildings \nacross my State--is in a class by itself. It's smart. It's effective. \nAnd it touches communities and people in very concrete ways\n  For example, the citizens of Charles City, IA, are revitalizing their \ndowntown and inspiring new interest in fine arts. Charles City received \na Main Street Challenge Grant to construct an elevator addition to the \nCharles City arts center, which is housed in a historic, city-owned \nbuilding that was originally a Carnegie Library. This elevator \ninstallation is the first phase of a project called ``Expanding \nAccessibility to the Arts,'' which aims to increase the number of \npeople who can experience the programs and services offered by the arts \ncenter. The next steps in the plan are to refurbish the building's \nworkshop and classroom areas to provide wheelchair access and eliminate \nsources of allergic reaction, and to expand the arts center exhibits \nand programs to meet the needs of the entire community.\n  This Carnegie Library building has been the cultural center of the \nCharles City community since it was opened to the public in 1904. When \nmuch of the downtown was devastated by a tornado in 1968, the Carnegie \nbuilding was miraculously spared. In 2004, the Carnegie Library \ncelebrated its centennial anniversary.\n  The addition of an elevator, plus other changes to improve access for \npeople with disabilities, will help to equip the Carnegie Library \nbuilding for its next 100 years. As the principal author of the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act, I am heartened to see more and more of \nour old, historic buildings being retrofitted to improve access for \ncitizens with disabilities.\n  The beauty of the Main Street Iowa program is that the ideas and \ninitiatives come from our small towns and rural communities. I have \nbeen pleased to secure $1.5 million in funding since 2002 for Main \nStreet Iowa Challenge Grants. The Iowa Department of economic \ndevelopment provides technical assistance, but, as we have seen in \nCharles City, success itself comes from local leadership, local \nteamwork, and home-grown ideas and solutions.\n  This project is demonstrates how renovations of old buildings can \nserve to jumpstart broader civic improvements. When people see one of \nthe anchors of Main Street being renovated or expanded, this can change \nthe whole psychology of a town or community. It offers hope. It serves \nas a catalyst for a far-reaching ripple effect of positive changes.\n  So I congratulate the citizens of Charles City for putting together a \nwinning proposal to secure a Main Street Challenge Grant. Their efforts \nto reinvigorate the city's historic downtown and improve access for \npeople with disabilities are setting a terrific example for other small \ntowns across America--and for that, I salute them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/08/senate-section/article/S9824-3", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9824-S9825]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       ADEL, IOWA, REINVIGORATION\n\n Mr. HARKIN.

Mr. Dunbar kept \nthe historic charm of the older buildings by refurbishing rather than \nreplacing the tin ceilings, and even maintained the old Masonic symbol \non one of the buildings.\n  The beauty of the Main Street Iowa program is that the ideas and \ninitiatives come from our small towns and rural communities. I have \nbeen pleased to secure $1.5 million in funding since 2002 for Main \nStreet Iowa Challenge Grants. The Main Street programs of the Iowa \nDepartment of Economic Development help provide technical assistance, \nbut, as we have seen in Adel, success itself comes from local \nleadership, local teamwork, and home-grown ideas and solutions.\n  Projects like the restoration of the Grandeur on the Square in Adel \nleverage the spirit and morale of people in our small towns and local \ncommunities. Grandeur on the Square has drawn affluent shoppers into \nAdel and has benefited downtown businesses. An average of 200 people \nnow go through downtown Adel daily as a result of the shopping and \ndining opportunities created by Mr. Dunbar. When people see one of the \nanchor businesses on Main Street being renovated or expanded, this can \nchange the whole psychology of a town or community. It offers hope. It \nserves as a catalyst for a far-reaching ripple effect of positive \nchanges.\n  I congratulate Aubrey Dunbar and the citizens of Adel for putting \ntogether a winning proposal to secure a Main Street Challenge Grant. \nTheir efforts to reclaim their heritage and reinvigorate their historic \ndowntown are setting a terrific example for other small towns across \nAmerica, and for that, I salute them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/08/senate-section/article/S9825-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9825]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   BEDFORD, IOWA, RECLAIMING HISTORY\n\n Mr. HARKIN.

And it touches communities and \npeople in very concrete ways.\n  For example, the citizens of Bedford, IA, have shown tremendous \ninitiative in rescuing and restoring an important piece of their \nheritage, the Garland Hotel, formerly known as the Bedford House. This \nbuilding and business has been a centerpiece in their downtown since \n1857. The Garland Hotel was placed on the National Register of Historic \nPlaces by the National Park Service in 1977, but it fell into disrepair \nand closed in 1997.\n  The citizens of Bedford are now determined to restore the Garland \nHotel its former glory, and they are doing so with the help of a Main \nStreet Challenge Grant. The $40,000 Main Street grant is not only \nhelping the Garland Hotel, it's serving as a catalyst to mobilize the \ncommunity and leverage additional funding. $260,000 has been invested \nby private citizens and companies to see the project through its \ncompletion.

No, the heart and soul of Iowa is in our family farms, and on \nMain Street in communities all across my State. That is why we need to \nbe as generous as possible and creative as possible in keeping our \ndowntowns not just alive but thriving.\n  As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I am involved in \nfunding many hundreds of programs every year. But the Main Street Iowa \nprogram--providing challenge grants to revitalize downtown buildings \nacross my State--is in a class by itself. It's smart. It's effective. \nAnd it touches communities and people in very concrete ways.\n  For example, the citizens of Valley Junction, IA, have been working \nhard to make their area a true destination in central Iowa and a more \nvibrant community. With the help of a Main Street Iowa Challenge Grant, \nthe Lagniappe in Valley Junction, a trendy boutique offering art, \njewelry, gifts, accessories, and clothing with an emphasis on local \nartists is now expanding. The retail area will be expanded by \napproximately 1,000 square feet and will offer garden art, fountains, \nplanters, wind chimes, and other outdoor accessories. The new addition \nwill also add a social flare to the specialty shop with an outdoor \nseating area for 50 people. The second floor remodeling will allow \nexpanded selection of wine and gourmet foods. The addition of a coffee/\nwine bar, featuring a beautifully preserved oak and marble bar, will \nprovide an elegant conversation area with access to a rooftop garden. \nThis New Orleans-style atmosphere is quite fitting for this boutique, \nnamed for the Creole term for ``a little something extra''\n  This expansion project is mainly the brainchild of Caren Sturm, the \nowner of the Lagniappe. Her creative and innovative thinking serves as \nan inspiration to the rest of Valley Junction, and the project itself \nwill allow for expanded business hours, special events, private \nparties, and jazz music on a regular basis. This upwards expansion is \nan innovative solution to the lack of commercial space present in the \nValley Junction area. It is a model for other proprietors to emulate, \nas demand for retail space far exceeds the availability of property. I \nsalute Caren Sturm and the rest of Valley Junction for their hard work \nto maintain the status of their town as one of the best retail and \ndowntown areas in Iowa.\n  The beauty of the Main Street Iowa program is that the ideas and \ninitiatives come from local creativity. I have been pleased to secure \n$1.5 million in funding since 2002 for Main Street Iowa Challenge \nGrants. The Main Street programs of the Iowa Department of Economic \nDevelopment help provide technical assistance, but, as we have seen in \nValley Junction, success itself comes from local leadership, local \nteamwork, and home-grown ideas and solutions.\n  This project is a shining example of new construction and a catalyst \nfor future projects. When people see one of the anchors of Main Street \nbeing renovated or expanded, this can change the whole psychology of a \ntown or community. It offers hope. It serves as a catalyst for a far-\nreaching ripple effect of positive changes.\n  So I congratulate Caren Sturm and the citizens of Valley Junction for \nputting together a winning proposal to secure a Main Street Challenge \nGrant. Their efforts to reinvigorate their historic downtown are \nsetting a terrific example for other shopping districts across America, \nand for that, I salute them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/08/senate-section/article/S9826-2", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9826]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 STORY CITY, IOWA, DOWNTOWN INVESTMENT\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, one of the greatest challenges we \nface--not just in Iowa but all across America--is preserving the \ncharacter and vitality of our small towns.

But the Main Street Iowa \nprogram providing challenge grants to revitalize downtown buildings \nacross my State is in a class by itself. It is smart. It is effective. \nAnd it touches communities and people in very concrete ways.\n  For example. the citizens of Story City, IA, and the editor of the \nStory City Herald, Eloise Thorson are making efforts to improve their \ndowntown and spur investment in the area. Eloise and the Story City \nHerald received a Main Street Challenge Grant in 2003 to reclaim their \nold downtown location. In 1987, the building that had housed the Story \nCity Herald was deemed unsafe for occupancy and demolished. Receipt of \nthe $25,000 Main Street Challenge Grant was the true catalyst to the \nreestablishment of the Story City Herald in its original location.\n  This positive change is causing more positive change, as vacancies in \nStory City's downtown are being filled and more building owners are \ntaking interest in improving the look of their downtown. Community \npride in the downtown is returning. Since becoming a Main Street Iowa \nCommunity in November of 2004, Story City's downtown has seen over $4 \nmillion in private investment, as well as a net gain of 16 businesses \nand 46 jobs.\n  Eloise Thorson and the Main Street Challenge Grant gave a great deal \nback to the community by replacing a long vacant building lot with a \nmagnificent piece of architecture, gracing Story City's ``main'' \nstreet. The community pride in this project is evident as pedestrians \nwalk along Broad Street and stop to show off this new construction to \nvisitors and tourists. Residents are proud to have this century-old \nbusiness located back in the downtown district, renewing faith in the \nfuture of Story City.\n  The beauty of the Main Street Iowa program is that the ideas and \ninitiatives come from our small towns and rural communities. I have \nbeen pleased to secure $1.5 million in funding since 2002 for Main \nStreet Iowa Challenge Grants. The Main Street programs of the Iowa \nDepartment of Economic Development help provide technical assistance, \nbut, as we have seen in Story City, success itself comes from local \nleadership, local teamwork, and home-grown ideas and solutions.\n  This project is a shining example of new construction and a catalyst \nfor future projects. When people see one of the anchors of Main Street \nbeing renovated or expanded, this can change the whole psychology of a \ntown or community. It offers hope. It serves as a catalyst for a far-\nreaching ripple effect of positive changes.\n  So I congratulate Eloise Thorson and the citizens of Story City for \nputting together a winning proposal to secure a Main Street Challenge \nGrant.

With the assistance of a \nMain Street Challenge grant, Jewell is taking great strides to restore \nthe vitality and beauty of their Main Street. One such project is at \n632 Main Street, a building that has housed a bank, a millinery, a \nnewspaper office, and a senior citizen center. Although the building \nhas been vacant for a number of years, the Jewell Area Development \nEnterprise plans to return the building to its former grandeur thanks \nin part to a Main Street HUD Challenge Grant. The hopes and dreams of \nthe original builders will once again be seen in Jewell's future \nthrough the renovated building that will hold prosperous businesses on \nthe main floor and an apartment on the upper story. The city received \n$40,000 through the Main Street Challenge program, and citizens have \ncalled that grant a catalyst for the renovation of 632 Main.\n  The beauty of the Main Street Iowa program is that the ideas and \ninitiatives come from our small towns and rural communities.

Main Street \nGreenfield was awarded a $30,000 Main Street Challenge Grant for the \nE.E. Warren Opera House Association to install an elevator. The \n$150,000 project was completed in July of this year. Other investments \nin the building have included weather proofing, outside facade \nimprovements, and interior rehabilitation including theater \nrestoration, installation of restrooms, mechanical and electrical \nsystems, remodeling, and decorating. The Opera House, which is listed \non the National Register of Historic Places, offers both historic and \nsentimental value to the Greenfield community. The physical size of the \nbuilding and its architectural significance enhance the aesthetics of \ntheir public square. The Opera House itself serves as a social center \nfor the arts, and as a site for community dances, theater performances, \nand meetings providing education in rural--folk--cultural, and fine \narts.

The Elkader Cinema, \nformerly known as the ``Circle Theatre,'' was repaired with the \nassistance of a Main Street Challenge Grant. The faded, broken marquee \nand dilapidated building were sad focal points in Elkader's downtown, \nand the entire building was on the verge of demolition when the \ncitizens of Elkader formed a special committee to spearhead the \nreopening the theatre. The committee was awarded a Main Street \nChallenge Grant of nearly $50,000. Without the grant from Main Street \nIowa, the private party who purchased and renovated the theatre \nbuilding most likely would not have undertaken the project, as it would \nhave been too risky.\n  The theatre is now a thriving business. It is open seven days a week, \nand attendance has proven the seven-day-a-week schedule to be \nworthwhile. The theatre has had a very positive impact on other \ndowntown businesses as well, bringing customers from all over Clayton \nCounty into Elkader. This project has been a tremendous success for \nElkader, Clayton County and Main Street Iowa.\n  The beauty of the Main Street Iowa program is that the ideas and \ninitiatives come from our small towns and rural communities.

But the Main Street Iowa \nprogram--providing challenge grants to revitalize downtown buildings \nacross my State--is in a class by itself. It's smart. It's effective. \nAnd it touches communities and people in very concrete ways.\n  For example, the citizens of Dubuque, IA are showing much initiative \nin restoring and renovating their downtown area. Dubuque actually \nreceived two Main Street Challenge Grants for their downtown; one to \nrestore a six-building, 30-residential unit, 13-storefront \nneighborhood, and one to revive a landmark building downtown.\n  The Upper Main Revitalization project started as a two-building \nrehab, and has since expanded to six buildings. Marking an important \ngateway into Dubuque's downtown district, Upper Main, arguably the \nneediest district in the city center, will be taken from one of the \nmost blighted blocks remaining in downtown Dubuque to one of the most \nrefreshed, vibrant stretches of street in the district. This project \nwill put the second and third floors of these buildings back into \nresidential use for the first time in more than 30 years. Momentum is \nalready growing in this district as a result of this project.\n  The second grant will be used to renovate and restore the Old German \nBank, whose most recent incarnation was as the Silver Dollar Cantina. \nThis building is an extremely significant structure in the oldest \nHistoric District in Dubuque. The building suffered a double hit 3 1/2 \nyears ago when the sandy soil in the Main Street area settled, causing \ncracks in the building. This halted business for several months. Then a \nfew months after it reopened, a fire totaled the building. The Silver \nDollar Cantina was popular long before the Old Main district was \nconsidered to be trendy, so it was a considerable loss to the downtown \narea when it was forced to close. With the use of their Main Street \nGrant, the Silver Dollar will open again, filling the niche of a \npopular lunchtime spot and even more popular nightclub. This grant is \nserving to preserve a true anchor of the community.\n  The beauty of the Main Street Iowa program is that the ideas and \ninitiatives come from our towns and rural communities. I have been \npleased to secure $1.5 million in funding since 2002 for Main Street \nIowa Challenge Grants. The Main Street programs of the Iowa Department \nof Economic Development help provide technical assistance, but, as we \nhave seen in Dubuque, success itself comes from local leadership, local \nteamwork, and home-grown ideas and solutions.\n  This project is a shining example of new construction and a catalyst \nfor future projects. When people see the anchors on Main Street being \nrenovated or expanded, this can change the whole psychology of a town \nor community. It offers hope. It serves as a catalyst for a far-\nreaching ripple effect of positive changes.\n  So I congratulate the citizens of Dubuque for putting together \nwinning Main Street proposals. Their efforts to reinvigorate their \nhistoric downtown are setting a terrific example for other small towns \nacross America, and for that, I salute them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/08/senate-section/article/S9828-3", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9828-S9829]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              CENTRAL CITY, IOWA, DOWNTOWN REVITALIZATION\n\n Mr. HARKIN.

This is about economics, but it is also about our culture \nand identity. After all, you won't find the heart and soul of Iowa at \nWal-Mart or Home Depot out in the strip malls. No, the heart and soul \nof Iowa is in our family farms and on Main Street in communities all \nacross my State. That is why we need to be as generous as possible--and \ncreative as possible--in keeping our downtowns not just alive but \nthriving.\n  As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I'm involved in \nfunding many hundreds of programs every year. But the Main Street Iowa \nprogram--providing challenge grants to revitalize downtown buildings \nacross my state--is in a class by itself. It's smart. It's effective. \nAnd it touches communities and people in very concrete ways.\n  For example, the citizens of Central City, IA, are making efforts to \nimprove their downtown areas. Central City received a $50,000 Main \nStreet Challenge Grant in 2002, and has since put that money to use \nrenovating 4 different buildings.\n  This first project was built in 1914 as a bank, but housed taverns \nand bars for more than 60 years. It was vacant for 15 years before \nrenovation, and is now in use as an art and gift center. It was the \nwinner of a 2004 Main Street Iowa Award for best total rehabilitation \nof a small building.\n  The next project allowed an international shipping and marketing \nservice company, to repair and re-paint the facade of their building, \nimproving the roof, decking, masonry, and parapets.\n  The third project, the McShane Annex, has been empty since 1989 when \na fire destroyed the interior of the building. Using the Main Street \nGrant, the building's renovation included a new rubber roof, removal of \nwarped plywood covering on the windows, an installation of energy \nefficient windows, and a restoration of the historic storefront of the \ntwo-story, brick Victorian commercial building. The building is now the \nhome of Timeless Treasures, an Americana retail store.\n  The final project is the renovation of the former Mills Hardware \nbuilding, another two story, brick Victorian commercial structure. This \nbuilding was vacant for 10 years. Rear windows were broken and the \nupstairs had become the home for nesting birds, but with the help of \nthe Main Street grant, the building quickly turned into the home of \nAragon Mortgage and Aragon Medical Equipment. Improvements and \nrenovations to the building included the installation of a new roof, \nrepair of the masonry, a paint job for the wood trim, the decorative \nmetal window cornices, and the roof parapet, the addition of an ADA-\ncompliant entrance, the creation of a new housing for the freight \nelevator, and the installation of more than 20 energy-efficient \nwindows.\n  The beauty of the Main Street Iowa program is that the ideas and \ninitiatives come from our small towns and rural communities. I have \nbeen pleased to secure $1.5 million in funding since 2002 for Main \nStreet Iowa Challenge Grants. The Main Street programs of the Iowa \nDepartment of Economic Development help provide technical assistance, \nbut, as we have seen in Central City, success itself comes from local \nleadership, local teamwork, and home-grown ideas and solutions.\n  These projects are a shining example of new construction and a \ncatalyst for future projects.

Mr. President, one of the greatest challenges we \nface--not just in Iowa but all across America--is preserving the \ncharacter and vitality of our towns. This is about economics, but it is \nalso about our culture and identity. After all, you won't find the \nheart and soul of Iowa at Wal-Mart or Home Depot out in the strip \nmalls. No, the heart and soul of Iowa is in our family farms and on \nMain Street in communities all across my State. That is why we need to \nbe as generous as possible and creative as possible in keeping our \ndowntowns not just alive but thriving.\n  As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I'm involved in \nfunding many hundreds of programs every year. But the Main Street Iowa \nprogram--providing challenge grants to revitalize downtown buildings \nacross my state--is in a class by itself. It's smart. It's effective. \nAnd it touches communities and people in very concrete ways.\n  An example of this effect can be found in the efforts of the citizens \nof Cedar Falls to restore and reinvigorate their downtown area. \nDowntown Cedar Falls pursued the Challenge Grant opportunity from Main \nStreet Iowa on behalf of two projects: The Black Hawk Hotel, which is \nthe oldest continuously running hotel in the state of Iowa; and the \nJiva Salon spa building. Both buildings received dramatic facade \nimprovements that restored the buildings to their intended looks, and \nas a result contributed to the success of the businesses that occupy \nthem. The hotel also renovated its interior, adding a barber shop, an \nevening lounge, 24 luxury suites, a deli, and a sushi bar, and the \nsalon now houses a first class spa that attracts a regional audience.\n  Downtown Cedar Falls is a newly recognized Cultural District by the \nIowa Department of Cultural Affairs, and that designation resulted in \npart from the impact of these two projects along with the other \ninvestments encouraged through their initiative. The beauty of the Main \nStreet Iowa program is that the ideas and initiatives come from our \ntowns and rural communities. I have been pleased to secure $1.5 million \nin funding since 2002 for Main Street Iowa Challenge Grants. The Main \nStreet programs of the Iowa Department of Economic Development help \nprovide technical assistance, but, as we have seen in Cedar Falls, \nsuccess itself comes from local leadership, local teamwork, and home-\ngrown ideas and solutions.\n  This project is a shining example of new construction and a catalyst \nfor future projects. When people see one of the anchor businesses on \nMain Street being renovated or expanded, this can change the whole \npsychology of a town or community. It offers hope. It serves as a \ncatalyst for a far-reaching ripple effect of positive changes.\n  I congratulate the citizens of Cedar Falls for putting together a \nwinning proposal to secure a Main Street Challenge Grant. Their efforts \nto revitalize their historic downtown are setting a terrific example \nfor other towns across America, and for that, I salute them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/08/senate-section/article/S9829-2", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9829]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/08/senate-section/article/S9829-3", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9829]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/08/senate-section/article/S9829-4", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9829-S9830]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:08 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Croatt, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 3169.

A bill to establish ocean bottom trawl areas in which \ntrawling is permitted, to protect deep sea corals and sponges, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. President, I rise today to introduce, with my \ncolleague Senator Martinez, a bill that will balance the needs of \nfishermen with the needs of some of our most precious and vulnerable \nocean resources: deep sea corals and sponges. Fishing and fishing \ncommunities are an important part of our culture, our history, and our \neconomy. Deep sea corals and sponges are an important suite of species \nwith wide economic potential extreme valuable ecologically. It is \nimperative that we protect the needs of both.\n  Deep sea corals are similar to tropical shallow-water corals, but are \nfound in the deep cold waters near seamounts, ridges, undersea canyons, \nand the margins of the continental shelf. Like shallow-water corals, \ndeep sea corals and sponges can form deepreefs and gardens that are \nessential to numerous marine species. For example, more than 1,300 \nspecies live among the Lophelia coral reefs in the northeastern \nAtlantic Ocean. These animals rely on complex coral and sponge habitats \nfor spawning, food, and shelter from predation.\n  Deep sea corals and sponges are also important to humans. They \nprovide habitat that commercially and recreationally important fish can \nuse, and many are under study as sources of new biomedical compounds to \nfight various diseases.\n  Scientists around the world believe that these newly discovered deep \nsea corals and sponges are as important as, if not more important than, \ntheir tropical cousins. The U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy suggested \nthat the biodiversity of deep sea coral communities may rival that of \nshallow-water coral reefs. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration stated in 2002 that deep sea coral ecosystems are ``much \nmore extensive and of more widespread economic importance than tropical \ncoral reefs.''\n  Unfortunately, some types of fishing gear are detrimental to deep sea \ncoral and sponge habitat. Today there is a serious risk that these \nprecious deep sea corals, sponges, and their complex habitats will be \ninadvertently destroyed before they can be properly assessed by the \nscientific community. A single pass with a bottom trawl can wipe out a \nswath of this habitat that, because these species are extremely slow-\ngrowing, can remain bare for decades if not centuries. The U.S. \nCommission on Ocean Policy's 2004 report emphasizes that deep sea \ncorals need action for protection. Five of the eight Regional Fisheries \nManagement Councils agree, and have recently set aside many of their \ncoral habitat areas as no-bottom-trawling zones.\n  The Bottom Trawl and Deep Sea Coral Habitat Act builds on actions of \nthese Councils, providing protection for deep sea corals and sponges \nwhile also preserving fishermen's access to areas that have \ntraditionally been trawled. The bill establishes three types of zones. \nAreas that are known to contain deep sea corals and sponges are set \naside as Coral Habitat Zones, granting these species immediate \nprotection. Areas that have been trawled at any time in the past seven \nyears are established as Bottom Trawling Zones, where bottom trawling \nis permitted. Areas that fit neither category are defined Undesignated \nZones, available at any time to be assigned as either Coral Habitat or \nBottom Trawling Zones with results of research activities. Fishermen \nplay a large role, through the Regional Councils, in defining how large \nthese zones will be, and other types of fishing that do not use bottom \ngear are not impacted.\n\n  The process of zone designation is designed not to shrink the area of \nexisting bottom trawling but to limit the opening of new grounds to \nbottom trawling until after scientists discover the extent of deep sea \ncorals and sponges. The intent is to preserve access to all areas that \ndo not contain deep sea coral and sponge and that have been part of the \nfishing community's traditional grounds. These are not small areas. \nTraditional bottom trawl grounds include a large proportion of the U.S. \nExclusive Economic Zone: 10 percent according to National Research \nCouncil data. In some regions, 75 percent of the shelf within 50 miles \nof shore in is trawled with bottom gear.\n  We must act quickly, and our legislation provides a balanced approach \nto protection of fishing and protection of the environment. I call on \nmy colleagues on the Commerce Committee, and the Senate leadership to \ntake up, consider, and pass this bill as soon as possible.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1635\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Bottom Trawl and Deep Sea \n     Coral Habitat Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Ocean resources are a vital component of the United \n     States economy, as noted by the United States Commission on \n     Ocean Policy.\n       (2) A proper balance of use and protection of ocean \n     resources is necessary to ensure the sustainability of such \n     resources.\n       (3) Deep ocean habitats provide fishery resources and sites \n     for deep sea corals and deep sea sponges.\n       (4) Many fishermen of the United States derive their \n     livelihoods from fishing in deep ocean areas.\n       (5) It is important that fishermen continue to be permitted \n     to use areas that have traditionally been fished, as long as \n     conservation considerations allow.\n       (6) According to the National Research Council, \n     approximately 10 percent of the United States Exclusive \n     Economic Zone, an area of a total of 3,400,000 square \n     nautical miles, is used each year by fishermen who employ \n     bottom trawls and, in the area that is 50 miles or less from \n     shore, this percentage is higher than 75 percent in some \n     regions.\n       (7) Vessel monitoring systems are increasingly used in the \n     fishing industry. For example, coverage of such systems for \n     bottom trawl vessels in the Pacific and North Pacific is 100 \n     percent.\n       (8) Deep sea corals and deep sea sponges host biological \n     diversity that, according to the United States Commission on \n     Ocean Policy, ``may rival that of coral communities in \n     warmer, shallower waters''. For example, more than 1,300 \n     species live among Lophelia coral reefs in the northeastern \n     Atlantic Ocean.\n       (9) Complex seafloor habitats created by structure-forming \n     organisms, such as deep sea corals and deep sea sponges, \n     provide spawning habitat, food, and shelter to numerous \n     fishes and other associated species,\n\n[[Page S9836]]\n\n     including commercially and recreationally targeted species.\n       (10) Deep sea corals and deep sea sponges typically exhibit \n     slow growth, extreme longevity, and highly patchy \n     distribution, predominately along continental margins, \n     seamounts, undersea canyons, and ridges.\n       (11) Deep sea corals and deep sea sponges have not been \n     fully studied for their benefit to society or for their \n     ecological importance to other associated species.\n       (12) Deep sea corals, deep sea sponges, and their \n     associated invertebrates are a potential source of compounds \n     with biomedical properties, some of which are currently in \n     clinical trials to study their anti-cancer, anti-tumor, and \n     anti-inflammatory properties.\n       (13) The United States Commission on Ocean Policy found \n     that deep sea corals, along with their shallow-water \n     counterparts, are declining at a ``disturbing pace,'' and \n     that certain types of fishing gear damage deep sea coral \n     ecosystems.\n       (14) The National Research Council, in a 2002 report to \n     Congress on the effects of trawling and dredging on seafloor \n     habitats, found that deep sea corals warrant protection, \n     based on evidence of the destruction of structured habitats \n     caused by bottom trawls and dredges.\n       (15) The President's Ocean Action Plan of 2004 ``encourages \n     all regional fishery management councils to take action, \n     where appropriate, to protect deep-sea corals when developing \n     and implementing regional fishery management plans'' and \n     includes provisions to ``research, survey, and protect deep-\n     sea coral communities''.\n       (16) In 2005, the North Pacific Fishery Management Council \n     proposed measures that will be adopted pending approval by \n     the Secretary of Commerce to confine use of bottom trawls in \n     the Aleutian Islands exclusive economic zone to specified \n     historically productive fishing areas, to disallow use of \n     bottom trawls in historically unfished areas of Aleutian \n     Islands waters where deep sea corals have been undisturbed, \n     to designate as no-trawling zones those areas where coral \n     ecosystems are known to exist, and to develop a comprehensive \n     plan for research and monitoring.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to provide for the establishment of programs and \nactivities to assist in mobilizing an appropriate healthcare workforce \nin the event of a health emergency or natural disaster; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, earlier this week I traveled with former \nPresidents Bush and Clinton to Houston and met countless hurricane \nsurvivors who shared heart-wrenching stories about their experiences. \nToo many of the hurricane survivors have lost their jobs, their homes, \nand for some, beloved friends and family members.\n  Hurricane Katrina served as another important reminder of man's \ninability\n\n[[Page S9845]]\n\nto control the wrath of Mother Nature. Yet, our response to such \ncalamitous events is completely within our control. Hurricane Katrina \nwas the first disaster, the Nation's emergency response to Hurricane \nKatrina was the second disaster.\n  We have all watched TV reports of residents stranded, abandoned \nreally, without food or water and medical care, while those charged \nwith emergency response delayed and fumbled their duties. Many of the \nsick and elderly were left behind at the makeshift hospital inside the \nNew Orleans airport, and others faced uncertainties regarding their own \nmedical care while staying at temporary shelters in Houston.\n  The Nation's generous outpouring of support for the survivors of \nHurricane Katrina is heart-warming. Yet, many of those who would \nvolunteer their services have been thwarted by bureaucratic red tape \nfrom antiquated laws and regulations. My own office has received \nnumerous complaints from constituents whose offers of service were \nrefused. In particular, medical professionals, which are still so \ndesperately needed in affected areas, were turned away from FEMA and \nnot informed about alternative mechanisms for volunteering. These \ndoctors also expressed concerns relating to licensure, liability, and \ntheir ability to take leaves of absence from their jobs.\n  The Federal Government should be doing everything possible to \nstreamline the process by which trained medical personnel around the \ncountry can volunteer their services in Louisiana, Mississippi, \nAlabama, and any of the States where evacuees have been relocated. I \nhave introduced legislation today, entitled the Hurricane Katrina \nEmergency Health Workforce Act of 2005, that will start this process.\n  There are five components to this bill. It would create a national \nemergency health professional volunteer corps, so that we will have a \nready pool of volunteer doctors and nurses who are willing, trained, \nand certified to serve in times of disaster. My bill would provide \nliability protections to qualified health professionals and provide the \nsame job protections that many Federal employees and members of the \nNational Guard already have. Requirements for State licensure would be \nlifted for licensed doctors who travel to disaster stricken areas \noutside of their home States. In addition, the CDC would establish a \nnational and easily accessible database with the names and contact \ninformation of doctors and nurses, as well as their specialties and \nlicensures, around the Nation. Finally, recognizing that emergencies \nare often unpredictable, this legislation would grant the Secretary \nbroad authority to suspend rules and regulations in order to get health \nprofessionals where they are needed and when they are needed.\n  Although we live in a changing and uncertain world, one constant \nremains--whether it be earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, or sadly \neven terrorist attacks, the nation will surely face future devastating \nand cataclysmic events. We know now that the Nation's preparedness for \nsuch events in no way matches our ability to respond and mitigate human \nsuffering and economic collapse. We must do better. I urge each of my \ncolleagues to join me in passing this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. NELSON of Florida:\n  S. 1640. A bill to prohibit price gouging relating to certain goods \nand services in areas affected by major disasters; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \n``Protection from Price Gouging Against Disaster Victims Act of 2005'' \nand ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1640\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND GOALS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the United States experiences tremendous generosity and \n     goodwill in the wake of natural disasters;\n       (2) unfortunately, some unscrupulous individuals take \n     advantage of those disasters in an attempt to gain \n     financially;\n       (3) the Federal Trade Commission is charged with preventing \n     unfair methods of competition and unfair and deceptive acts \n     or practices under section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission \n     Act (15 U.S.C. 45);\n       (4) the Federal Trade Commission has extensive experience \n     analyzing markets and competitive issues in order to \n     determine whether market participants are engaging in actions \n     that may have anticompetitive effects; and\n       (5) the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation \n     of the Senate and the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the \n     House of Representatives are charged by their respective \n     Houses with consumer protection.\n       (b) Goals.--The goals of this Act are--\n       (1) to decrease the occurrence of persons charging \n     unconscionably excessive prices for consumer goods and \n     services following natural disasters;\n       (2) to require the Federal Trade Commission to conduct \n     ongoing investigations of actions intended to disadvantage \n     consumers following natural disasters; and\n       (3) to ensure that sufficient enforcement authority is \n     available to the Commission to carry out the responsibilities \n     of the Commission under this Act and the amendments made by \n     this Act.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Army to carry out a \nproject for the mitigation of shore damage attributable to the project \nfor navigation, Saco River, Maine; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill for the \nCity of Saco, ME that concerns the town's ability to allow the mooring \nof boats on the Saco River. The bill changes the turning basin into an \nanchorage while managing a 50-foot channel within the anchorage. The \ntown was not aware that it was in violation because of 21 moorings \nlocated in the Saco River Federal Navigational Project. In an effort to \neliminate this encroachment, city officials have requested a \nmodification or deauthorization of the Federal Navigational Project to \nresolve the issue.\n  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has suggested language that re-\ndesignates the maneuvering basin into an anchorage area that will meet \nthe needs of the community. The language, which I hope will be included \nin the Water Resources Development Act in this Congress, will allow for \nthe legal moorage of boats, the fairway for which would be maintained \nby the City of Saco as is customary for towns with Federal anchorages. \nIt is my understanding that the two mayors of the cities involved along \nwith the Saco Yacht Club have agreed to the Corps' language.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORNYN:\n  S 1642. A bill to prohibit narco-terrorists from aiding and \nsupporting terrorists and terrorist organizations; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Narco-\nTerrorism Prevention Act of 2005. This bill confronts the new reality \nand very real danger of the deadly mix of drug trafficking and \nterrorism.\n  Many of the State Department's designated Foreign Terrorist \nOrganizations are involved in the trafficking of illegal drugs--that \nis, illegal drugs that end up on the streets of cities throughout our \ncountry and other countries and poison the fabric of our society, our \nchildren, our families, and our neighbors. Terrorists, like the old \norganized crime syndicates from the past, have recognized that illegal \ndrug trafficking is a valuable source of financing and another way to \nthreaten our country.\n  The evidence linking these two criminal activities is overwhelming: \nterrorists in Afghanistan have been infiltrating and controlling the \ncultivation of poppies, and ultimately heroin; media reports indicate \nthat the deadly Spain bombings were financed by drug money; the \nHezbollah has been linked to drug trafficking; and of course, the \nRevolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or the FARC, has long-standing \ndrug trafficking operations which fund their deadly activities.\n  Narco-terrorism takes many forms, all of which are deadly. Before \nSeptember 11, the term called to mind Pablo Escobar, the classic \ncocaine trafficker who used terrorist tactics against citizens and \nofficials to protect his drug trade. Post 9/11, governments now find \nthemselves combating classic terrorist groups that participate in, or \notherwise receive funds from, drug trafficking in order to further \ntheir agenda. But whether narco-terrorists are actual drug traffickers \nwho use terrorism against civilians to advance their agenda, or are \nprincipally terrorists who out of convenience or necessity use drug \nmoney to further their cause, the label of narco-terrorist may be \nequally applicable to both groups, and the full force of U.S. law \nshould be brought to bear on these organizations.\n  My State is experiencing the collateral effects of a drug war being \ncarried out by modern day narco-terrorists in Nuevo Laredo, Mexico. \nNews reports have described an ongoing battle between rival drug \ncartels over drug smuggling routes from Mexico into the United States. \nThese organizations assassinate police officers and other government \nofficials in a clear attempt to force the local government in Nuevo \nLaredo to allow these organizations to carry on their illegal activity, \nunimpeded. Our government needs every available tool at its disposal to \ncombat this activity.\n  The legislation I introduce today creates a new Federal crime \ndesigned to punish the trafficking of controlled substances which are \nintended to benefit a foreign terrorist organization or any one else \nplanning a terrorist attack. It also carries a stiff, mandatory-minimum \npenalty of 20 years for anyone convicted. Importantly, the Narco-\nTerrorism Prevention Act provides for extraterritorial jurisdiction \nwhich allows law enforcement to reach beyond our borders to arrest and \ndeter those who intend to carry out a crime of this nature.\n  This bill says that whether you are a member of or assisting a drug \ncartel along the border that employs terrorist tactics to protect its \ndrug trade, or you are assisting international terrorists with the \nproceeds from drug transactions, this bill targets you. This bill puts \nyou on notice that our government has the authority to arrest you and, \nwhen apprehended, you will face a lengthy, and perhaps permanent, stay \nin prison.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 1643.

A bill to establish ocean bottom trawl areas in which \ntrawling is permitted, to protect deep sea corals and sponges, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. President, I rise today to introduce, with my \ncolleague Senator Martinez, a bill that will balance the needs of \nfishermen with the needs of some of our most precious and vulnerable \nocean resources: deep sea corals and sponges. Fishing and fishing \ncommunities are an important part of our culture, our history, and our \neconomy. Deep sea corals and sponges are an important suite of species \nwith wide economic potential extreme valuable ecologically. It is \nimperative that we protect the needs of both.\n  Deep sea corals are similar to tropical shallow-water corals, but are \nfound in the deep cold waters near seamounts, ridges, undersea canyons, \nand the margins of the continental shelf. Like shallow-water corals, \ndeep sea corals and sponges can form deepreefs and gardens that are \nessential to numerous marine species. For example, more than 1,300 \nspecies live among the Lophelia coral reefs in the northeastern \nAtlantic Ocean. These animals rely on complex coral and sponge habitats \nfor spawning, food, and shelter from predation.\n  Deep sea corals and sponges are also important to humans. They \nprovide habitat that commercially and recreationally important fish can \nuse, and many are under study as sources of new biomedical compounds to \nfight various diseases.\n  Scientists around the world believe that these newly discovered deep \nsea corals and sponges are as important as, if not more important than, \ntheir tropical cousins. The U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy suggested \nthat the biodiversity of deep sea coral communities may rival that of \nshallow-water coral reefs. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration stated in 2002 that deep sea coral ecosystems are ``much \nmore extensive and of more widespread economic importance than tropical \ncoral reefs.''\n  Unfortunately, some types of fishing gear are detrimental to deep sea \ncoral and sponge habitat. Today there is a serious risk that these \nprecious deep sea corals, sponges, and their complex habitats will be \ninadvertently destroyed before they can be properly assessed by the \nscientific community. A single pass with a bottom trawl can wipe out a \nswath of this habitat that, because these species are extremely slow-\ngrowing, can remain bare for decades if not centuries. The U.S. \nCommission on Ocean Policy's 2004 report emphasizes that deep sea \ncorals need action for protection. Five of the eight Regional Fisheries \nManagement Councils agree, and have recently set aside many of their \ncoral habitat areas as no-bottom-trawling zones.\n  The Bottom Trawl and Deep Sea Coral Habitat Act builds on actions of \nthese Councils, providing protection for deep sea corals and sponges \nwhile also preserving fishermen's access to areas that have \ntraditionally been trawled. The bill establishes three types of zones. \nAreas that are known to contain deep sea corals and sponges are set \naside as Coral Habitat Zones, granting these species immediate \nprotection. Areas that have been trawled at any time in the past seven \nyears are established as Bottom Trawling Zones, where bottom trawling \nis permitted. Areas that fit neither category are defined Undesignated \nZones, available at any time to be assigned as either Coral Habitat or \nBottom Trawling Zones with results of research activities. Fishermen \nplay a large role, through the Regional Councils, in defining how large \nthese zones will be, and other types of fishing that do not use bottom \ngear are not impacted.\n\n  The process of zone designation is designed not to shrink the area of \nexisting bottom trawling but to limit the opening of new grounds to \nbottom trawling until after scientists discover the extent of deep sea \ncorals and sponges. The intent is to preserve access to all areas that \ndo not contain deep sea coral and sponge and that have been part of the \nfishing community's traditional grounds. These are not small areas. \nTraditional bottom trawl grounds include a large proportion of the U.S. \nExclusive Economic Zone: 10 percent according to National Research \nCouncil data. In some regions, 75 percent of the shelf within 50 miles \nof shore in is trawled with bottom gear.\n  We must act quickly, and our legislation provides a balanced approach \nto protection of fishing and protection of the environment. I call on \nmy colleagues on the Commerce Committee, and the Senate leadership to \ntake up, consider, and pass this bill as soon as possible.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1635\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Bottom Trawl and Deep Sea \n     Coral Habitat Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Ocean resources are a vital component of the United \n     States economy, as noted by the United States Commission on \n     Ocean Policy.\n       (2) A proper balance of use and protection of ocean \n     resources is necessary to ensure the sustainability of such \n     resources.\n       (3) Deep ocean habitats provide fishery resources and sites \n     for deep sea corals and deep sea sponges.\n       (4) Many fishermen of the United States derive their \n     livelihoods from fishing in deep ocean areas.\n       (5) It is important that fishermen continue to be permitted \n     to use areas that have traditionally been fished, as long as \n     conservation considerations allow.\n       (6) According to the National Research Council, \n     approximately 10 percent of the United States Exclusive \n     Economic Zone, an area of a total of 3,400,000 square \n     nautical miles, is used each year by fishermen who employ \n     bottom trawls and, in the area that is 50 miles or less from \n     shore, this percentage is higher than 75 percent in some \n     regions.\n       (7) Vessel monitoring systems are increasingly used in the \n     fishing industry. For example, coverage of such systems for \n     bottom trawl vessels in the Pacific and North Pacific is 100 \n     percent.\n       (8) Deep sea corals and deep sea sponges host biological \n     diversity that, according to the United States Commission on \n     Ocean Policy, ``may rival that of coral communities in \n     warmer, shallower waters''. For example, more than 1,300 \n     species live among Lophelia coral reefs in the northeastern \n     Atlantic Ocean.\n       (9) Complex seafloor habitats created by structure-forming \n     organisms, such as deep sea corals and deep sea sponges, \n     provide spawning habitat, food, and shelter to numerous \n     fishes and other associated species,\n\n[[Page S9836]]\n\n     including commercially and recreationally targeted species.\n       (10) Deep sea corals and deep sea sponges typically exhibit \n     slow growth, extreme longevity, and highly patchy \n     distribution, predominately along continental margins, \n     seamounts, undersea canyons, and ridges.\n       (11) Deep sea corals and deep sea sponges have not been \n     fully studied for their benefit to society or for their \n     ecological importance to other associated species.\n       (12) Deep sea corals, deep sea sponges, and their \n     associated invertebrates are a potential source of compounds \n     with biomedical properties, some of which are currently in \n     clinical trials to study their anti-cancer, anti-tumor, and \n     anti-inflammatory properties.\n       (13) The United States Commission on Ocean Policy found \n     that deep sea corals, along with their shallow-water \n     counterparts, are declining at a ``disturbing pace,'' and \n     that certain types of fishing gear damage deep sea coral \n     ecosystems.\n       (14) The National Research Council, in a 2002 report to \n     Congress on the effects of trawling and dredging on seafloor \n     habitats, found that deep sea corals warrant protection, \n     based on evidence of the destruction of structured habitats \n     caused by bottom trawls and dredges.\n       (15) The President's Ocean Action Plan of 2004 ``encourages \n     all regional fishery management councils to take action, \n     where appropriate, to protect deep-sea corals when developing \n     and implementing regional fishery management plans'' and \n     includes provisions to ``research, survey, and protect deep-\n     sea coral communities''.\n       (16) In 2005, the North Pacific Fishery Management Council \n     proposed measures that will be adopted pending approval by \n     the Secretary of Commerce to confine use of bottom trawls in \n     the Aleutian Islands exclusive economic zone to specified \n     historically productive fishing areas, to disallow use of \n     bottom trawls in historically unfished areas of Aleutian \n     Islands waters where deep sea corals have been undisturbed, \n     to designate as no-trawling zones those areas where coral \n     ecosystems are known to exist, and to develop a comprehensive \n     plan for research and monitoring.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to provide for the establishment of programs and \nactivities to assist in mobilizing an appropriate healthcare workforce \nin the event of a health emergency or natural disaster; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, earlier this week I traveled with former \nPresidents Bush and Clinton to Houston and met countless hurricane \nsurvivors who shared heart-wrenching stories about their experiences. \nToo many of the hurricane survivors have lost their jobs, their homes, \nand for some, beloved friends and family members.\n  Hurricane Katrina served as another important reminder of man's \ninability\n\n[[Page S9845]]\n\nto control the wrath of Mother Nature. Yet, our response to such \ncalamitous events is completely within our control. Hurricane Katrina \nwas the first disaster, the Nation's emergency response to Hurricane \nKatrina was the second disaster.\n  We have all watched TV reports of residents stranded, abandoned \nreally, without food or water and medical care, while those charged \nwith emergency response delayed and fumbled their duties. Many of the \nsick and elderly were left behind at the makeshift hospital inside the \nNew Orleans airport, and others faced uncertainties regarding their own \nmedical care while staying at temporary shelters in Houston.\n  The Nation's generous outpouring of support for the survivors of \nHurricane Katrina is heart-warming. Yet, many of those who would \nvolunteer their services have been thwarted by bureaucratic red tape \nfrom antiquated laws and regulations. My own office has received \nnumerous complaints from constituents whose offers of service were \nrefused. In particular, medical professionals, which are still so \ndesperately needed in affected areas, were turned away from FEMA and \nnot informed about alternative mechanisms for volunteering. These \ndoctors also expressed concerns relating to licensure, liability, and \ntheir ability to take leaves of absence from their jobs.\n  The Federal Government should be doing everything possible to \nstreamline the process by which trained medical personnel around the \ncountry can volunteer their services in Louisiana, Mississippi, \nAlabama, and any of the States where evacuees have been relocated. I \nhave introduced legislation today, entitled the Hurricane Katrina \nEmergency Health Workforce Act of 2005, that will start this process.\n  There are five components to this bill. It would create a national \nemergency health professional volunteer corps, so that we will have a \nready pool of volunteer doctors and nurses who are willing, trained, \nand certified to serve in times of disaster. My bill would provide \nliability protections to qualified health professionals and provide the \nsame job protections that many Federal employees and members of the \nNational Guard already have. Requirements for State licensure would be \nlifted for licensed doctors who travel to disaster stricken areas \noutside of their home States. In addition, the CDC would establish a \nnational and easily accessible database with the names and contact \ninformation of doctors and nurses, as well as their specialties and \nlicensures, around the Nation. Finally, recognizing that emergencies \nare often unpredictable, this legislation would grant the Secretary \nbroad authority to suspend rules and regulations in order to get health \nprofessionals where they are needed and when they are needed.\n  Although we live in a changing and uncertain world, one constant \nremains--whether it be earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, or sadly \neven terrorist attacks, the nation will surely face future devastating \nand cataclysmic events. We know now that the Nation's preparedness for \nsuch events in no way matches our ability to respond and mitigate human \nsuffering and economic collapse. We must do better. I urge each of my \ncolleagues to join me in passing this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. NELSON of Florida:\n  S. 1640. A bill to prohibit price gouging relating to certain goods \nand services in areas affected by major disasters; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \n``Protection from Price Gouging Against Disaster Victims Act of 2005'' \nand ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1640\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Army to carry out a \nproject for the mitigation of shore damage attributable to the project \nfor navigation, Saco River, Maine; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill for the \nCity of Saco, ME that concerns the town's ability to allow the mooring \nof boats on the Saco River. The bill changes the turning basin into an \nanchorage while managing a 50-foot channel within the anchorage. The \ntown was not aware that it was in violation because of 21 moorings \nlocated in the Saco River Federal Navigational Project. In an effort to \neliminate this encroachment, city officials have requested a \nmodification or deauthorization of the Federal Navigational Project to \nresolve the issue.\n  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has suggested language that re-\ndesignates the maneuvering basin into an anchorage area that will meet \nthe needs of the community. The language, which I hope will be included \nin the Water Resources Development Act in this Congress, will allow for \nthe legal moorage of boats, the fairway for which would be maintained \nby the City of Saco as is customary for towns with Federal anchorages. \nIt is my understanding that the two mayors of the cities involved along \nwith the Saco Yacht Club have agreed to the Corps' language.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORNYN:\n  S 1642. A bill to prohibit narco-terrorists from aiding and \nsupporting terrorists and terrorist organizations; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Narco-\nTerrorism Prevention Act of 2005. This bill confronts the new reality \nand very real danger of the deadly mix of drug trafficking and \nterrorism.\n  Many of the State Department's designated Foreign Terrorist \nOrganizations are involved in the trafficking of illegal drugs--that \nis, illegal drugs that end up on the streets of cities throughout our \ncountry and other countries and poison the fabric of our society, our \nchildren, our families, and our neighbors. Terrorists, like the old \norganized crime syndicates from the past, have recognized that illegal \ndrug trafficking is a valuable source of financing and another way to \nthreaten our country.\n  The evidence linking these two criminal activities is overwhelming: \nterrorists in Afghanistan have been infiltrating and controlling the \ncultivation of poppies, and ultimately heroin; media reports indicate \nthat the deadly Spain bombings were financed by drug money; the \nHezbollah has been linked to drug trafficking; and of course, the \nRevolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or the FARC, has long-standing \ndrug trafficking operations which fund their deadly activities.\n  Narco-terrorism takes many forms, all of which are deadly. Before \nSeptember 11, the term called to mind Pablo Escobar, the classic \ncocaine trafficker who used terrorist tactics against citizens and \nofficials to protect his drug trade. Post 9/11, governments now find \nthemselves combating classic terrorist groups that participate in, or \notherwise receive funds from, drug trafficking in order to further \ntheir agenda. But whether narco-terrorists are actual drug traffickers \nwho use terrorism against civilians to advance their agenda, or are \nprincipally terrorists who out of convenience or necessity use drug \nmoney to further their cause, the label of narco-terrorist may be \nequally applicable to both groups, and the full force of U.S. law \nshould be brought to bear on these organizations.\n  My State is experiencing the collateral effects of a drug war being \ncarried out by modern day narco-terrorists in Nuevo Laredo, Mexico. \nNews reports have described an ongoing battle between rival drug \ncartels over drug smuggling routes from Mexico into the United States. \nThese organizations assassinate police officers and other government \nofficials in a clear attempt to force the local government in Nuevo \nLaredo to allow these organizations to carry on their illegal activity, \nunimpeded. Our government needs every available tool at its disposal to \ncombat this activity.\n  The legislation I introduce today creates a new Federal crime \ndesigned to punish the trafficking of controlled substances which are \nintended to benefit a foreign terrorist organization or any one else \nplanning a terrorist attack. It also carries a stiff, mandatory-minimum \npenalty of 20 years for anyone convicted. Importantly, the Narco-\nTerrorism Prevention Act provides for extraterritorial jurisdiction \nwhich allows law enforcement to reach beyond our borders to arrest and \ndeter those who intend to carry out a crime of this nature.\n  This bill says that whether you are a member of or assisting a drug \ncartel along the border that employs terrorist tactics to protect its \ndrug trade, or you are assisting international terrorists with the \nproceeds from drug transactions, this bill targets you. This bill puts \nyou on notice that our government has the authority to arrest you and, \nwhen apprehended, you will face a lengthy, and perhaps permanent, stay \nin prison.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 1643.

Mr. President, for milions of people in the Gulf Coast, \nHurricane Katrina has shredded the very fabric of everyday life. As my \ncolleagues from Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama have already \ndescribed, the needs are immeasurable. For many people, it will be \nyears before their lives return to normal. And untold others have paid \nwith their lives. We hold the citizens of Louisiana, Mississippi, and \nAlabama in our thoughts and in our prayers.\n  This storm calls on each of us to respond in the best way that we \ncan. And people around the United States are opening their homes and \ntheir hearts to the victims of Hurricane Katrina.\n  Among the most immediate and pressing needs of many who have been hit \nby hurricane Katrina is a fundamental one--food. Displaced individuals \nwith no ready source of income must, among all of their daily worries, \nstill struggle with the basic task of feeding their families. This \nsituation is exacerbated by the simple fact that retail food outlets \nhave ceased to operate throughout the Gulf Coast. The Department of \nAgriculture has estimated that food stamp program caseloads alone are \nlikely to increase by 1.4 million people because of Katrina. \nFurthermore, the Department says that this is a ``very conservative'' \nestimate and that the real need may be considerably greater than this.\n  In Louisiana alone, over 400,000 people are already receiving food \nstamps through the Emergency Food Stamp Program. In Texas, over 100,000 \npeople have received emergency food stamps. These numbers are rising \nrapidly with every passing day and are certain to continue to do so.\n  No American should live in the shadow of hunger and food insecurity, \nleast of all those displaced and devastated by natural disasters. \nFortunately, the Federal Government has long provided food assistance \nto help individuals and families in need. The Department of Agriculture \nis already working hard to get commodities and emergency food stamps to \nthe victims of Hurricane Katrina. And while there has been much \ncriticism of the disaster efforts generally, I have yet to hear of \ncomplaints about the response from the Department of Agriculture. Even \nso, we can and must do more.\n  That is why today, with my colleague Senator Leahy, I am introducing \nthe Hurricane Katrina Food Assistance Relief Act of 2005. I am hopeful \nthat my colleagues will join us in working to pass this legislation \nexpeditiously to enhance our Federal response to the needs of hungry \nAmericans devastated by Hurricane Katrina.\n  This proposal would provide USDA with additional funding and \nauthorities to provide a strong and continuous response to the food \nneeds of thousands of families adversely affected by Hurricane Katrina. \nThe legislation builds upon the capacities of several Federal programs \nto assist our citizens in need. The legislation targets three groups of \nhouseholds: Those living in areas hit by Katrina, those who have lost \njobs in the disaster areas, and those who have relocated from the \ndisaster area to other parts of the country.\n  This bill provides additional funds to allow for unanticipated \ncaseload increases in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for \nWomen, Infants, and Children.\n  It also gives the Department of Agriculture additional funds to \npurchase bulk commodities and to provide emergency food through food \nbanks and local food pantries.\n  The legislation especially strengthens the ability of the Food Stamp \nProgram to respond to this tremendous disaster by increasing benefit \namounts, expanding eligibility, and streamlining the application \nprocess and the delivery of benefits. It also provides additional \nFederal funds to State food stamp agencies that are likely to be \noverwhelmed by the workload associated with helping all those who seek \naid.\n  I ask that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle join with Senator \nLeahy and me in continuing to shape an appropriate response to the food \nneeds of the victims of Hurricane Katrina. The legislation that we are \nintroducing today is a good faith effort and is, I believe, a generous \nand appropriate starting point. But I have no doubt that it may be \nimproved. I welcome the advice and suggestions of my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle and look forward to doing all that we can with all \nnecessary haste to bring relief to the victims of Hurricane Katrina.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1643\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to promote the employment of workers displaced by \nHurricane Katrina in connection with Hurricane Katrina reconstruction \nefforts; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we have all watched in horror as the Gulf \nCoast has been struck by what could be the worst natural disaster in \nU.S. history, leaving unimaginable suffering in its wake. It is \ndifficult to put into words how heartbroken we are for the Americans \naffected by Hurricane Katrina.\n  Brave souls everywhere are still searching for some family members, \nwhile trying to keep others alive and hopeful. We have seen the \ninspiring courage of the survivors and dedicated men and women working \naround the clock to help them.\n  Thousands of people have lost their lives. Far more have lost life as \nthey know it--their families, their homes, their communities, and their \njobs.\n  There has already been an increase in people filing for unemployment \nbenefits due to Hurricane Katrina. And, the jobs that have been lost \nwill be gone for a long time.\n  To help people who have lost their jobs because of this crisis, I am \nintroducing the ``Hurricane Katrina Reconstruction and Displaced Worker \nAssistance Act of 2005.''\n  This legislation would give priority in awarding Federal contracts \nfor the rebuilding efforts to those companies where workers displaced \nby Hurricane Katrina comprise at least 25 percent of the workforce \nfulfilling the contract. This will help provide jobs to those who have \nbeen severely affected by the hurricane.\n\n[[Page S9849]]\n\n  We must show those who have suffered so much that their government \nwill help them rebuild their lives. I urge my colleagues to support the \nbill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER:\n  S. 1645. A bill to establish a first responder interoperable \ncommunications grant program; to the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing a bill to provide \nhelp to State and local first responders in purchasing interoperable \ncommunications systems--so that everyone can talk to one another during \nan emergency.\n  This need has been glaringly apparent for over a decade now, but \nespecially since the 2001 terrorist attacks. It was all the more \nevident in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.\n  The 9/11 Commission described the inability to communicate as ``a \ncritical element'' at the World Trade Center and at the crash sites, \nwhere multiple agencies and multiple jurisdictions responded in \nSeptember 2001. And yet four years after that attack, our first \nresponders still cannot talk to each other.\n  Let me mention just one example from the areas affected by Hurricane \nKatrina.\n  National Guard members have compared communications capabilities in \nNew Orleans unfavorably with those in Iraq. Ground commanders for New \nOrleans have been functioning without the ability to track the location \nof some units reporting to them. This is unacceptable.\n  Almost every community I visit in California--from big to small--\nmentions the need for interoperable communications for first responders \nand the need for assistance from the federal government. California \nsuffered from a lack of interoperable communications in the fall of \n2003, when communities could not communicate with each other to convey \nwhat was happening with fires that were sweeping through the State, \ngreatly complicating the response.\n  We need to provide funding so that State and local first responders \ncan purchase the technology that makes interoperability possible. We \nneed to do our job at the national level and provide our first \nresponders with the resources to protect our communities in the case of \na terrorist attack, natural disaster, or other emergency.\n  I have tried to get funds for interoperable communication systems as \npart of the Intelligence Bill, the Rail Security Bill, and the Homeland \nSecurity Appropriations Bill. The time to act is past. We need to get \nthis done before the next disaster strikes, which is why I am \nreintroducing this bill.\n  My bill would authorize $300 million for each of the next 5 years to \nhelp State and local agencies improve existing communications systems \nor purchase new systems. This funding would help local agencies \npurchase equipment for real-time interoperable communication between \nfirst responders.\n  Guaranteeing that first responders will have the communications \nequipment necessary to respond to a future attack is exactly the kind \nof preemptive action we should have taken after 9/11 and should be \ntaking now.\n  A report on the needs of first responders by Warren Rudman and \nRichard Clarke found that fixing this problem would cost $6.8 billion. \nMy bill does not fund this all, but we need to do something.\n  This bill is an important step in fulfilling our federal \nresponsibility to protect our citizens during emergencies. I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Mr. Reid, and Mrs. Murray):\n  S. 1646. A bill to provide for the care of veterans affected by \nHurricane Katrina; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nwould provide continuous care to those veterans that have been affected \nby Hurricane Katrina, one of the worst natural disasters that our \ncountry has ever experienced. The Department of Veterans Affairs, VA \nhas played an integral role in the disaster relief efforts of Hurricane \nKatrina, beginning with the successful evacuation of patients, staff \nand family members, and now in the recovery stage of the aftermath.\n  Earlier today, I attended a briefing given by VA Secretary Nicholson \nand other VA officials on VA's response to the hurricane. VA truly \nstepped up in the midst of this crisis, and successfully evacuated all \nof their patients and staff without any loss of life. I commend VA for \ntheir coordination and execution of their relief effort. The Department \nshould serve as a model for other government agencies in dealing with \ndisasters.\n  There is one area, however, where I believe even more can be done to \nhelp veterans in Louisiana and Mississippi who have been affected by \nthis tragedy. The legislation I'm introducing will extend a \nhumanitarian hand to those middle-income veterans in the region who do \nnot have access to VA health care because of a decision made by this \nadministration in 2003. The bill extends hospital care and medical \nservices to the Priority 8 veterans affected by Hurricane Katrina, who \nhave previously been denied access to the system.\n  Veterans residing in areas of New Orleans, LA; Biloxi, MS, or \nGulfport, MS, during the hurricane--who have most likely lost \neverything in this disaster--will be able to find solace in knowing \nthat VA will continue to be there for them even after the media \nattention fades. It would simply be wrong to exclude these men and \nwomen who have served our country from VA services, especially now in \ntheir time of need. This bill also serves to relieve some of the \nfinancial burden placed on the veterans by waiving copayments for care \nand medications.\n  VA's mission is to take care of veterans and also to provide support \nto other Federal agencies during times of disaster. VA has upheld that \nmission by establishing a legacy of first rate health care for veterans \nand now through the response efforts to Hurricane Katrina. We can do \nmore for these veterans by allowing VA to serve as a beacon of hope in \ntheir time of recovery.\n  I would like to thank the countless VA volunteers that have answered \nthe call of duty to our Nation, just as our veterans once did.

A bill to amend title 11, United States Code, to provide \nrelief to victims of Hurricane Katrina and other natural disasters; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, the \nSenate is faced with a daunting but absolutely crucial task. How can \nCongress best respond to the horrific damage caused by this disaster? I \nwant to express my full support to the people from all of the affected \nregions in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama and their congressional \ndelegations. In this time of desperate need, we all must pull together \nand do everything we can to help.\n  We can see the devastating effects of the hurricane and flooding on \nour television screens every night. It will take years to rebuild the \naffected areas. In the meantime, the residents and small businesses in \nthose areas have suffered catastrophic losses. Some will undoubtedly, \nthrough no fault of their own, have to file for bankruptcy sometime in \nthe future. The bankruptcy system is an important safety net for people \nwho suffer this kind of devastation. In this country, we do not \nsentence people who have been through a disaster of this type to a \nlifetime of financial servitude. Bankruptcy lets them get a fresh \nstart. And a fresh start is what so many of the relief efforts going on \nare all about.\n  As my colleagues are aware, Congress earlier this year enacted major \nchanges to the Bankruptcy Code. The Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and \nConsumer Protection Act (``BAPCPA'') was the first major overhaul of \nthe bankruptcy system in more than 25 years. Most provisions of the new \nlaw will become effective on October 17, 2005, six months after \nenactment. Any bankruptcy case filed before that date is still subject \nto current law.\n  We do not yet know how many families affected by this disaster will \nend up filing for bankruptcy. A study just released a few days ago by \nProfessor Bob Lawless, a law professor at the University of Nevada, \nindicates that bankruptcy filings increase significantly in areas where \nnatural disasters occur. Professor Lawless looked at 18 hurricanes and \ntropical storms since 1980 and the rate of bankruptcy filings in the \nStates where the storms made landfall compared to the surrounding \nStates and the rest of the country. He looked at the effects in the \nfirst, second and third year after the event.\n  According to this study, bankruptcy filings climbed in landfall \nStates at more than 1\\1/2\\ times the pace of unaffected States and \nremained stuck at that rate even three years later. Given the enormous \nimpact of this storm, we can expect a similar if not greater, increase \nin filings. And this new influx of filings will occur just as the new \nlaw is going into effect. Katrina victims will in essence be guinea \npigs, testing the new provisions with the most desperate of \ncircumstances.\n  The new bankruptcy law makes it significantly more difficult and \ncomplicated to file for bankruptcy. No one disputes that. It was \nintended to weed out abusers of the system. It contains new \ndocumentation requirements and the so-called ``means test'' which is a \nfairly rigid formula designed to identify debtors who really can \ncontinue to pay their debts and shouldn't get a discharge.\n  Everyone in the Senate knows that I strongly opposed the BAPCPA and \ntried very hard to amend it to make it less onerous for good faith \ndebtors. But my goal now is not to try to undermine or reopen the new \nlaw, but simply to make sure that it doesn't compound the hardship \nfaced by victims of Hurricane Katrina and other natural disasters. That \nis what the bill I will introduce today, the Hurricane Katrina \nBankruptcy Relief and Community Protection Act of 2005, aims to do.\n  This bill first deals directly with the fact that the new law is \nscheduled to take effect only a month and a half from now, when the \nvictims of Katrina will still be in the initial stages of putting their \nlives back together. I believe the best way to handle this \nextraordinary situation is to give Katrina victims a grace period \nduring which the old bankruptcy law, which has essentially been in \neffect for 27 years, will still apply to their cases. The bill provides \nthat cases filed within one year of the effective date of the new law \nby people who lived in the natural disaster area declared by the \nPresident will be handled under the law in effect on August 29, 2005, \nthe date of the hurricane. This provision will mean that all the \ncomplicated work to apply and interpret the new law that will take \nplace in the first year after it becomes effective will not affect the \ncases of the victims of Hurricane Katrina.\n  I understand that some may argue that the new law contains adequate \nsafeguards and judicial discretion to deal with the concerns I have \nraised. But we can't know that for sure at this point. At the very \nleast, there will be litigation and disagreement over how some \nprovisions will be interpreted. Those issues will be settled by the \ncourts all across the country, and that process will not be affected by \nthis bill. But Katrina's victims should not be the test cases. Giving \nthem a year to proceed under the old law seems entirely reasonable.\n  Providing this added grace period also addresses the fact that some \nof the hurricane victims might have filed their petitions before \nOctober 17 were it not for the hurricane. These people have been \ndeprived of that right, which Congress provided in the new law itself, \nby a natural disaster. Given all they are now going through, we should \ngive them adequate time to take care of their most immediate needs \nbefore closing the door on their ability to file for bankruptcy under \nthe old law. A one year grace period should be sufficient, and seems \nfair.\n  Professor Lawless's study indicates that the financial effects of a \ndisaster like Katrina last for more than a year. And of course, there \nwill be future disasters, perhaps some as grave as this one. I believe \nwe need to take a close look at the new bankruptcy law and make sure \nthat disaster victims are treated fairly. There is simply no \njustification for applying provisions designed to stop abuse of the \nsystem to people who have been through this kind of disaster. \nTherefore, the bill makes a number of other amendments to the new law \nthat will apply not only to Katrina victims who file for bankruptcy \nafter the one year grace period is over but to victims of other natural \ndisasters. Let me describe some of those provisions.\n  First, the bill builds on an exemption to the means test that applies \nto disabled veterans and simply adds victims of natural disasters to \nthat exemption. No person driven to bankruptcy by a natural disaster \nshould have a case dismissed or converted to a Chapter 13 filing under \nthe means test.\n  The bill also exempts from the definition of income any payments from \nFEMA, the Red Cross, or other disaster relief funds. Whatever money \npeople receive to help them survive the aftermath of a disaster should \nnot be included in the calculation of how much they have available to \nsatisfy their creditors. Generous citizens around the country are \nmaking contributions to make sure disaster victims are fed and clothed \nand their homes rebuilt, not to give more money to the credit card \ncompanies.\n  The bill contains a provision to make clear that expenses incurred as \na result of a disaster are considered reasonable expenses for purposes \nof the means test. The rigid IRS standards obviously don't include \nmoney to replace things that were lost in a hurricane, or pay for a \nhotel stay while a home is rebuilt.\n  Another provision of the new law that seems unfair to apply to \nvictims of natural disasters requires that debtors seek credit \ncounseling before they file for bankruptcy. The new law already \nincludes a provision to exempt debtors who are on active duty military \nservice overseas or who are incompetent or disabled if that status \nmakes them unable to complete the requirement. Victims of natural \ndisasters deserve a similar exemption. If they can't complete credit \ncounseling because they live in a shelter with no access to the \nInternet or because they have no records for the credit counselor to \nevaluate, they shouldn't be prevented from filing for bankruptcy.\n\n[[Page S9851]]\n\n  One of the most tragic effects of a natural disaster is homelessness. \nMillions of homes were destroyed by Katrina. People who lived in these \nhomes will be in temporary shelters for months, but may eventually find \napartments to live in in a new location. If they end up having to file \nfor bankruptcy, that filing puts in place an automatic stay of any \nlegal proceedings against them, including eviction proceedings for \nnonpayment of rent. The automatic stay allows debtors to get their \naffairs in order and catch up on their rent payments, but the new law \nmakes it much easier for landlords to have the stay lifted. The \nprospect of a natural disaster victim being put out on the street \nduring a bankruptcy proceeding should be chilling to all Americans. \nThis bill will simply require landlords of natural disaster victims to \nseek a lifting of the stay without the expedited procedures and special \ntreatment that the new law provides.\n  Another provision of the bill gives some extra relief to natural \ndisaster victims from the fairly rigid deadlines that are established \nfor filing certain paperwork in connection with a bankruptcy filing. \nThis is a very reasonable step that simply recognizes that obtaining or \nfiling the necessary tax returns, identity documents, documentation of \nincome and other items may be significantly more difficult, or even \nimpossible for a period of time, for natural disaster victims than it \nis for other debtors.\n  Finally, the bill also provides relief for small businesses that are \nput in dire financial condition by a natural disaster. The new law \nincludes some very tight and unmovable deadlines for small businesses \nseeking to reorganize under Chapter 11. If we want to help as many \nbusinesses hit by disasters to survive as possible, we need to give the \ncourts flexibility to extend those deadlines.\n  I know that many people in this body worked very hard over a period \nof many years to pass the BAPCPA. As much as we disagreed about the \nmerits of that bill, I respect their hard work. But I truly hope that \nmy colleagues will not let pride of authorship or the fact that they \nsupported that bill stand in the way of providing desperately needed \nhelp to the victims of Hurricane Katrina and other natural disasters. \nThe changes in this bill are modest and will apply to a relatively \nsmall number of people. I suppose some may argue that they are not \nabsolutely necessary, but I believe, at the least, that a very good \nargument can be made that they are. Shouldn't we err on the side of \nhelping people whose lives have been ripped apart? Shouldn't we take \nevery precaution to make sure that the horror of a natural disaster is \nnot compounded by a bankruptcy law that is too rigid or too harsh? I \nbelieve that is the least we can do in these circumstances.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting these modest but \nimportant changes to the law. I ask that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1647\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have exerted very \n     large demands on the Treasury of the United States and \n     required tremendous sacrifice by the members of the Armed \n     Forces of the United States.\n       (2) Congress has a constitutional responsibility to ensure \n     comprehensive oversight of the expenditure of United States \n     Government funds.\n       (3) Waste and corporate abuse of United States Government \n     resources are particularly unacceptable and reprehensible \n     during times of war.\n       (4) The magnitude of the funds involved in the \n     reconstruction of Afghanistan and Iraq and the war on \n     terrorism, together with the speed with which these funds \n     have been committed, presents a challenge to the effective \n     performance of the traditional oversight function of Congress \n     and the auditing functions of the executive branch.\n       (5) The Senate Special Committee to Investigate the \n     National Defense Program, popularly know as the Truman \n     Committee, which was established during World War II, offers \n     a constructive precedent for bipartisan oversight of wartime \n     contracting that can also be extended to wartime and postwar \n     reconstruction activities.\n       (6) The Truman Committee is credited with an extremely \n     successful investigative effort, performance of a significant \n     public education role, and achievement of fiscal savings \n     measured in the billions of dollars.\n       (7) The public has a right to expect that taxpayer \n     resources will be carefully disbursed and honestly spent.\n\n     SEC. __02.

Mr. President, tomorrow, the Senate will resume \nconsideration of a very important bill, the Commerce-Justice-Science \nappropriations bill, a large bill and a bill on which we have a number \nof amendments to be considered and a bill that does have a direct \napplication to our disaster response to Katrina.\n  Although there will be no rollcall votes tomorrow, the managers will \nbe here ready to continue with the amendment process and expedite \nconsideration of the bill. We now have a limited number of first-degree \namendments in order, and I encourage Senators to come to the floor \ntomorrow, as well as Monday, so that we can complete action on this \nbill early next week.\n  Monday evening, we will have an hour of debate followed by a vote on \nthe motion to proceed to S.J. Res. 20, a resolution of disapproval. \nThat vote will occur at 6:30 p.m., and additional votes are possible \ninto the evening.\n  Mr. President, in closing, this has been a challenging week for the \nentire country and, indeed, for the Senate as we have responded in an \nexpeditious way to this natural disaster that the Nation has witnessed \nunfolding. We approached our response in the Senate at three different \nlevels or three different phases or three different elements.\n  The first is this immediate action for relief and recovery, immediate \nresponse, quick action, considering legislation brought to the floor \nand setting other business aside to address that important immediate \nresponse.\n  We will continue to do that over the course of the next week and the \nweek after that to make sure we address the needs that must be \naddressed at the Federal level through this body to facilitate the \nresponse to the disaster, focusing, of course, first and foremost on \nthe safety and welfare of the victims.\n  Other immediate action was the $10.5 billion that we passed last \nThursday night and then the $51.8 billion that we passed tonight, which \nwill be signed here shortly and signed by the President within the next \nhour or so.\n  Another example is the Federal courts relief bill that we passed so \nthat Louisiana Federal courts could be up and running with appropriate \nsites.\n  The second phase that is ongoing is the consideration of rebuilding, \nreconstruction, and this involves consideration of a whole range of \nissues through not all but most of our committees, in terms of \nredevelopment with strong economic incentives to capture the dynamism \nand the power of the private sector in partnership with the public \nsector.\n  It is going to take the strength of the public and the private sector \nworking together to accomplish that successful rebuilding and \nreconstruction of a part of the country that can return and will return \nwith a much more modern and revitalized future, a future that is \nactually very exciting as we look to the rebuilding and reconstruction, \nsomething to which the Governor, local officials, and the Federal \nGovernment are committed.\n  The third phase is analyzing very carefully what went right but \nprobably even more importantly what went wrong in our response--meaning \nour generic response, everyone's response--to this natural disaster. \nThings did not go as well as anyone would like, Americans deserve \nanswers, and we will get to the bottom of that.\n  We have established a bicameral, bipartisan committee with the House \nand the Senate working together to carry out that analysis. In \naddition, we have designated in this body the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee as the lead committee in oversight.\n  I mention these three elements because with so much activity, it is \nimportant for both our colleagues and the American people to know that \nwe are working on each of these three elements with immediate action \nwhich requires expeditious consideration on the floor of the Senate; \nsecondly, rebuilding and reconstruction to an even more modern and \nrevitalized and very exciting future for the Gulf States; and thirdly, \nto investigate and analyze what went wrong.\n  We will continue with all of that over the course of the evening and \ntomorrow and through the weekend, and everybody will keep pulling \ntogether and acting in the best interest of the American people, with \nour thoughts and prayers going out to those people who have been so \ndramatically affected, along with the States, and who are now spread \nall over the United States of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/08/senate-section/article/S9861-5", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9861]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
